In fact, I'd say that all of those indicators supersede the stock market as a measure of economic health.  That said, using stocks as a measure of economic health is problematic in a number of ways. The Dow Jones especially has its own issues, but beyond that there are a number of things that make stocks a poor measure. While a rising stock price can be an indirect indicator that a firm is hiring more people, expanding production and raising profits (all which generally have positive effects on the economy), it can also simply be the result of a lot of money pouring into the stock market. The latter can be an especially significant issue because it indicates the lack of profitable investment opportunities outside of the stock market, which could suggest economic weakness.  Personally, I'd say that the reason stock market numbers are so frequently mentioned is that many people have money invested in the stock market, whether it's giant institutional investors or blue-collar workers putting money into their retirement accounts. So while the stock numbers are generally a weak indicator of economic performance (and certainly weaker than real GDP, unemployment, productivity growth and so on), stock numbers are still important for many people."

AskSocialScience,3dwsws,skyclerk,31,Mon Jul 20 04:39:33 2015 UTC,"Ooh, finally a question I know something about. What you write is true, but it's only part of the story.   The conventional wisdom on this question is often referred to as 'transinstitutionalization,' where people who were released from hospitals with nowhere to go ended up getting arrested and thrown in prison (i.e., moved from one institution to another).  Mental Hospitals started to shrink and close down in the 1960s due to a combination of reduced funding, advances in medication treatment, and scandals about the inhumane treatment and conditions in many mental hospitals (this shrinking trend continued into the 1980s).   So far, so good, though it should be noted that the main impetus behind the huge drop in mental hospital patients in the 1960s were the amendments to the social security act, which created medicare and medicaid. The new law said that states could not be reimbursed for patients in mental hospitals, but they could be reimbursed for patients in nursing homes. So a lot of patients, especially aging and female, were moved to nursing homes.   Why didn't the act cover mental hospitals? Well in 1963 Congress passed the Community Mental Health act that basically sought to establish outpatient mental health treatment clinics as a way to enable people to get care in their community (especially access to new medications) without having to be hospitalized. Along with this was a growing belief that in many cases it was a violation of people's civil rights to lock them in a mental hospital unless they were clearly a danger to themselves or others (a strict constitutional standard still in place today). Anyway the idea is actually a good one, but Congress never really supplied anything close to adequate funding for these community clinics, so there aren't that many of them and they are stretched to the breaking point.   Now, here is where the conventional wisdom on transinstitutionalization gets things wrong. It was not really the case that people were let out of mental hospitals and arrested for crime or disturbing the peace or whatever, and then put into jails. In fact the majority of people in mental hospitals did not fit the demographic profile of people in prisons and jails (many were female and older, for example, and relatively few minorities). But the shrinking of the mental health system (along with a higher constitutional bar for forced hospitalization) did take away a kind of release valve for dealing with people with severe mental health issues.   So now here we are: we've got a prison system that is of a scale that is unprecedented in world history and a very meager community clinic and hospital system for dealing with mental health issues. Our go-to solution for dealing with social deviance is the jail cell. If you're acting crazy, but you're not clearly an imminent danger to yourself or others, there is not much else the police can do... and that is especially true if you don't have family support or money to afford treatment or hospitalization.   The most authoritative study I know of is Steven Raphael and Michael Stoll's 2013 paper in the Journal of Legal Studies: “Assessing the Contribution of the Deinstitutionalization of the Mentally Ill to Growth in the U.S. Incarceration Rate.”  Their conclusion: "" We find no evidence of transinstitutionalization for any demographic groups for the period 1950–80. However, for the 20-year period 1980–2000, we find significant transinstitutionalization rates for all men and women, with a relatively large transinstitutionalization rate for men in comparison to women and the largest transinstitutionalization rate observed for white men. Our estimates suggest that 4–7 percent of incarceration growth between 1980 and 2000 is attributable to deinstitutionalization. While this is a relatively small contribution to prison growth overall, the results suggest that a sizable portion of the mentally ill behind bars would not have been incarcerated in years past.""  One last thing to note: mental hospitals were no great shakes and arguably not more humane than prisons. So they are probably not the best alternative to prisons. Rather, a more fully funded and pro-active community mental health solution would probably be a better way to channel people with mental illness out of the criminal justice system."
AskSocialScience,3dwsws,daddie_o,3,Mon Jul 20 10:45:15 2015 UTC,"I've read that there are severely mentally ill homeless who end in a limbo where they get put in jail because of the actions caused by their illness, get treated and get medication for it, get released and then relapse as the medication runs out and they can't afford any more, and end up in jail again.  I was curious if you know if there is any data on how common this is, as it's clearly an appalling waste of resources and an terrible way of treating people in general."
AskSocialScience,3dwsws,tabulae,4,Mon Jul 20 18:52:02 2015 UTC,"No, I don't know how common this is. But from the experience I've had studying a mental health court in a major US city, it's rarely as simple as that. In this city, there are resources for indigent people with mental illness to get free medication, as I suspect is true of most large American cities. More than that, they can access group therapy treatment and other resources through Medicaid.   But many, even maybe the majority, of homeless people with mental illness also have some kind of drug addiction. In addition to that, many people with severe mental illness (not just indigent ones) either lack insight into their illness or feel that they aren't really themselves when they're on medication. (The medication can make you tired and foggy-headed, and part of the thing that goes along with some illnesses like mania for example is a kind of feeling of being amazing, which you lose when you're on medication.)   Given these two factors alone (there are certainly others, such as distance to the clinic where you have to go to take your medication every day), it's very difficult for people to keep themselves medicated. So in my observation, many people would cycle through as in your description, but it was often due to some life event or circumstances where they stopped taking their medication daily and then just headed into a downward spiral. And given their life circumstances, it was very difficult for them to distance themselves from other drug addicts and negative influences (or triggers).   And I'm not saying that to be judgmental. They've been dealt really shitty cards in life, and I don't know that I would turn out any better. You know, if you think about it, what is the end game for most of these folks? They get on their meds, sober ub, and then ... get a shit minimum wage job and try to eke out a living...? It's pretty bleak.   The fact of the matter is that there are people who you just aren't going to be able to help, for one reason or another.  But for the people who can be helped, free medication is just not going to be enough in most cases. You'd need to invest a lot more resources than we currently do to get their lives back on track.   As a side note, one of the big innovations now are mental health courts and 'coercive community treatment' where courts monitor and enforce defendant's compliance with outpatient treatment. Basically trying to get them back on track and guard against them falling off the wagon. These methods do seem to be helpful. But I think that the only real solution to many of these kinds of problems is a major restructuring of the political economy of the U.S. These targeted policy interventions can help on the margins, but urban decay in the U.S. is the driving force, and if you don't fix that, this other stuff is like trying to kill and elephant with a fly swatter."
AskSocialScience,3dwsws,daddie_o,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:27:26 2015 UTC,"What you say is true, and it is an appalling waste of resources. The problem is, there is no good place to put these people. County mental health facilities are intended only for short-term treatment. Board and care homes (paid for mostly by MedicAid, MediCare and Social Security Disability payments) are run for profit in private homes by ordinary people. They cannot handle patients who are aggressive, disruptive or uncooperative. The big state hospitals have pretty much disappeared. They aren't cost-effective in any case. They are constructed and staffed according to hospital safety standards, and as a result, they are far too expensive. When the state hospitals started shutting down, in the 1960s, the average state hospital patient cost the taxpayers about $100,000 per year. In today's money, it's at least five times too much -- much more expensive than the average prison cell.  What's needed is a new kind of institution, a relatively safe, benign place, not too expensive, where the residents are mostly protected from themselves, though some protection from other residents would also be necessary. This kind of institution would also be a better placement for many prisoners. The closest thing I know of in the U.S. is the ""honor farm"" at many county jails.  Some new laws would also be necessary to support and manage institutions like this, and to confine people to them. Some civil libertarians would HATE this idea. They would insist people have the right to be ""free"" unless convicted of a crime. I get that, it's not wrong. But that line of reasoning takes us back to the current system, which is not working well.  I wonder if some countries, outside of the U.S., have better ideas about how to care for such people.  On the other hand, compared to other nations, the U.S. has far more people per capita who are mentally ill and/or homeless and/or sometimes breaking the law and/or have serious drug or alcohol problems and/or are estranged from their families and communities.  Why more in the U.S. than anywhere else? It's an interesting and difficult question, but off the topic of this thread."

OP, if you're interested there is a book called American Psychosis by Dr. E.F. Torrey. It isn't the most research-heavy book (not a very long list of citations cited, at least) but it is a brief and easily digested narrative of some of the reasons the national mental health system went down the tubes.  (In addition to what has already been said) From what I remember from this book, in the mid- to late-20th century there was a national push by a group of renowned psychologists and leaders in the field of mental health toward Community Mental Health Centers. These were intended to be different from mental hospitals (which as /u/daddie_o mentioned were in deplorable shape) in that they emphasized the prevention of mental illness rather than treatment. I'm a bit fuzzy on how they intended to prevent mental illness, but I believe it had something to do with insuring that they engaged their community and helped citizens to feel connected to one another, organized community events toward this end, and provided educational resources for impoverished or low-income families.  I believe Dr. Torrey asserts in his book that these centers were overall abysmal failures. These advocates of community mental health centers had convinced government policy makers that mental hospitals would be unnecessary in the future because mental illness would dissipate, but there isn't any evidence to suggest that the centers were successful in preventing mental illness to any significant degree. Meanwhile mental hospitals were being de-funded so that they couldn't receive or treat as many patients, thus leading to the transinstitutionalization figures already cited."

Martin et al. 2003 came up with a humor styles questionnaire, here's the abstract with some relevant points highlighted:   Describes the development and initial validation of the Humor Styles Questionnaire, which assesses four dimensions relating to individual differences in uses of humor. These are: relatively benign uses of humor to enhance the self (Self-enhancing) and to enhance one’s relationships with others (Affiliative), use of humor to enhance the self at the expense of others (Aggressive), and use of humor to enhance relationships at the expense of self (Self-defeating). Validation data indicate that the four scales differentially relate in predicted ways to peer ratings of humor styles and to measures of mood (cheerfulness, depression, anxiety, hostility), self-esteem, optimism, well-being, intimacy, and social support. They also relate to all five dimensions of the Five Factor Model and to Agency and Communion. The first two scales overlap with previous humor tests, whereas the Aggressive and Self-defeating humor scales largely tap different dimensions.

He just won the Clark medal in 2014 and his research is almost exclusively about media slant.    The general takeaway from his research is that media firms are profit maximizing and even editorial decisions are influenced by the media source's consumers.  If a consumer is looking for a news source they trust, they'll infer the source is higher quality when its reports conform to the consumer's prior expectations.    In one of his more highly cited papers, for example, he takes a sample of 429 newspapers and looks at how often they use language similar to politician's in a given political party.  So Republicans, for example, are more likely to use the phrases ""death tax"" or ""private property rights"" and Democrats will be more likely to use the phrases ""minimum wage"" or ""caliber sniper rifles.""  Using this measure of media slant he shows it's less affected by the owner or reporters ideology and more the result of the politics of the geographical region the newspaper serves and its consumer base.  So the Boston Globe might have more of a left slant while the Oklahoman might be more right leaning.

AskSocialScience,3dqne1,Ndlovunkulu,11,Sat Jul 18 19:22:42 2015 UTC,"Off note - that paper really frustrates me only in that they make a measure of media slant for only a single Congressional session. I've been working on a project that wanted to include a good measure of media slant across a lot of newspapers, and there really isn't anything besides what they did, and it is only available for a single year.   Also interestingly, at one point I did some cross-tabs on endorsements and media slant (dividing it up by top third, center third and bottom third). There really was NOT a strong relationship."
AskSocialScience,3dqne1,geneusutwerk,6,Sat Jul 18 22:30:20 2015 UTC,"You can construct the media slant for any year of Congressional Record if you have the text for it.  They outline how to do so in Section 3, specifically section 3.1.   You basically need to index the Congressional session, compute a relatively easy Chi-Squared value for each phrase, and sort based on that value.  If you had the counts for each of the 2-3 word phrases, you could almost do it in excel (except there are going to be a long long tail of phrases that only appear once or twice, you need to cull the list before importing to excel but keep the count of words spoken before) but I'd recommend doing it in something like perl / python / stata / whatever.  The code to breakdown text of Congressional sessions into 2-3 word phrases and their counts is pretty straightforward in perl or python -- you can probably find someone to write it for you for $50-$100 on a freelancing site.  Heck, Gentzkow might have the code if you shoot him an email (but check Econometrica's site first, sometimes code is attached).  They provide the data for 1995 to 2006, see edit 3 link below.  The real issue, if I recall correctly is that text versions of the Congressional Record are not available for all years.  I think older issues of Congressional Record were scanned and are available online as images, but most were not converted to text.  I think applying an image -> text converter resulted in a lot of typographic errors due to ink splotches and the like.  There's just too much of it to be worth paying Indian data entry workers, which will run you $0.10 a page for double-linked entry (bare minimum you want).  Though it's been quite a few years since I've looked into this stuff; the technology (and the scans) for image->text conversion may have improved enough to make it feasible.  edit: Just double checked and it seems like digital text version of Congressional Record only goes back to 1995.  I believe this was the major roadblock.  While I'm sure the phrases changed from 1995 to 2005, there's probably not going to be much change of a newspapers slant within 10 year, so you'll likely get very correlated estimates of 1995 and 2005 slant.  Plus once you enter into a panel series you're going to have many more problems about why certain papers dropped out / does that change the remaining papers, etc.  I believe this is a big topic of their panel work with Sinkinson on newspaper competition.  edit2: Ah yeah, now I remember, one problem with the image -> text was identifying who is speaking.  Since the names are also viable to have ink blots or what not, it gets especially messy.  Maybe if you had 2-3 sets of scans from different prints of the same record.  Even digitally connecting who is speaking to particular Congressional representative is a headache, since they'll have guest speakers show up from time to time... I think?  edit3:  Actually Gentzkow / Shapiro has already converted 1995 to 2006 counts and put it up on ICPSR  I guess you'd just need to write the Chi-Squared bit for those years.  http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/33501"

AskSocialScience,3dqne1,geneusutwerk,8,Sun Jul 19 02:51:12 2015 UTC,"Probably also worth noting that some of the personality traits that are most strongly associated with being conservative also have obvious relationships with the way we would expect conservatives to consume media as opposed to the way liberals would.  For instance, to speak in lay terms, conservatives tend not to value new experiences or variety just for its own sake when compared to liberals. This should make intuitive sense. It is thus probably unsurprising that the average liberal will consume more media sources than the average conservative, who would rather find a trusted source and stick to it. The market would inevitably respond to this, giving liberals lots of options since they demand them. So I think if you wanted to categorize media outlets as liberal/conservative based on audience (which wouldn't be the best way, even if it is the neatest), you'd find a ton of stuff left of center and a few things way right of center.

Elite cues and media bias in presidential campaigns - Explaining public perceptions of a liberal press. Communication Research 26(2)  Abstract: Public perception of a biased news media, particularly media biased in a liberal direction, has increased over the past 3 presidential elections. To examine what might be influencing this public opinion, the authors look at shifts in public perception of media bias, press coverage of the topic of media bias, and the balance in valence coverage of presidential candidates-all during the 1988, 1992, and 1996 presidential elections. Their results suggest that the rise in public perception that news media are liberally biased is not the result of bias in valence news coverage of the candidates, but, rather, due to increasing news self-coverage that focuses on the general topic of bias in news content. Furthermore, the increased claims of media bias come primarily from conservative elites who have proclaimed a liberal bias that is viewed as including the entire media industry.  Now you need to decide whether you trust liberal academics to tell you the truth. Oops. You're in an epistemological quagmire."

Despite research to the contrary, the general public and a significant number of politicians are convinced the U.S. news media have a liberal and pro-Democratic bias. To understand why many people believe the media have such biases, this study tested whether such a perception is related to an observer's own partisan and ideological positions. Findings based on two large national surveys suggest that audiences' ideologies and partisanships affect how they view the media. Strong conservatives and Republicans are more likely to distrust the news media, whereas the best predictor of a media bias perception is political cynicism."

So as a conservative you tell people ""all of the stuff you hear in the media is liberal bullshit."" You do this to get those people to feel safe in ignoring the news as it is reported and accept the biased versions they hear from conservatives (either from politicians or from conservative news sources).  Great example: most media sources stopped talking about Benghazi because it's just a nothing story.  But because conservatives needed to have an issue to hammer Hillary on, Fox and other conservative media kept that story alive.  Now if you talk to a conservative they really believe Benghazi is a big deal and it's just not at all.  But to them the only reason that the mainstream media don't cover Benghazi is because they are liberal shills.

The phenomenon of Françoise Sagan had a big impact on the social theorist Guy Debord. His key ideas were formed in his Report on the Construction of Situations where he addressed the Françoise Sagan phenomenon as it was unfolding before his eyes, and he went on to write The Society of the Spectacle which adressed the nature of celebrity amongst other things through a Marxist lens of a society mediated by images which I'd argue is even more relevant today than when it was written."

So, we know deductive reasoning.   All men are mortal.  Kass is a man.  Therefore, Kass is mortal.  It makes sense. We take a generalization (as far as I am aware, all men are mortal) as our assumption. We then find an example (Here is a man!). And then we assume the conclusion (This man is mortal).   However, there is an issue within this. See, we had to assume step 1. Which, is fine. By basic, western, English-translated accounts, that's science. We make a statement (theory), and we continue to test different things against the theory (step 2) and find we're correct, knowing that we may come across a step 2 that disproves #1. But, we still entered having to believe #1 was, for all we knew, true.  But what if it wasn't?   Let's skip inductive reasoning and move onto a more interesting reasoning. Abductive.   We observe the lawn is wet.   1) The lawn is wet.   2) It may have rained last night.   3) If it rained last night, it makes sense why the lawn is wet. Of course, maybe someone flew over with water and dropped it on my lawn. Or maybe I just turned off the sprinklers. Or maybe my Uncle Chuck was here and reading out loud every entry in the dictionary with the suffix ""th"" and the amount of spit that comes out of his mouth with every ""th"" sound caused the lawn to be wet.   It raining seems like a reasonable explanation. I'll go with that until I discover a better option.   And here, I didn't have to assume anything. I took my observation, I thought back to previous experiences and what would make sense, based on my experiences, and made an educated guess. Here, I come to a similar (I realize that deductive reasoning leads to conclusions that, if we accept A, must be true, while abductive leads to conclusions that might not be true) conclusion from part A, but do not need to accept the fact that there is anything true in my conclusion.  So, I would question your statement that abductive reasoning lacks critical thought. Here's a funny website where the author points out that Sherlock Holmes is an abductive reasoner. I would say he's pretty critical in thought.   Anyway, in general, you want to look into heuristics. Kanheman and Tversky for more economically based examples, but they fit into many fields. I think your question falls under the availability heuristic, which is basically we take what comes easiest to mind as fact first. Good example would be people took less flights after 9/11 because they felt unsafe, even though flying is much safer than cars (but it's a lot easier to think of 9/11 because it's so salient) and because more people drove, car crashes went up even more."

There is not enough data to get a real sense of the difference if any exists, especially once other confounders are taken into account.    That being said the selection bias in jurors for capital cases is a topic of discussion and one that has attracted some considerable criticism.  This process leads to juries that are less diverse as support for the death penalty is much higher among whites and males in particular and much lower among blacks as one of the few groups that poll against the death penalty.  An experimental study has found that the process of death penalty qualification actively biases jurors against the defendant.

However, we have no idea whatsoever what kind of language these people spoke. Also, languages never really form out of nothing (with some exceptions, like Klingon). We can't really say when Uralic languages ""formed"", since they would've developed out of something else. Languages never really ""start"", so you can't compare the ""age"" of different languages. According to wikipedia, Sami languages seem to have spread from Finland or Karelia to Scandinavia during the Nordic Iron Age (1200-2500 years ago). However, we don't know what the inhabitants of northern Scandinavia spoke before that. And people had been living there for many millenia already. Maybe they already spoke some closely related Uralic languages? Just because a language, or a variation of a language spreads geographically doesn't mean we have some vast invasion of people that replaces the previous inhabitants.   If you're wondering where the Uralic languages initially spread from, there are some guesses: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Uralic_homeland_hypotheses  The fact that Samis are officially recognized in e.g., Sweden as an ""ursprungsbefolkning"", which I guess could be translated to ""original indigenous people"", has nothing to do with the language. It also has nothing to do with how Samis relate to other indigenous people in e.g., Siberia. All it means is that it's officially recognized that ""they"" have been there (northernmost part of Scandinavia) for a very long time. And ""they"" in this context means not-whatever-ethnicity-most-Swedes-are. It's a political thing more than anything else. It recognizes that there have been, for a very long time, people with a distinct culture, speaking non-Germanic languages in the far north, and that they shouldn't be considered invaders.

Hans Morgentheau, Ken Waltz, and John Mearsheimer are usually considered the major scholars of (varying different sub-schools of) this perspective. (As a side note, Thucydides, the classical historian, is often considered a proto-Realist in his treatment of the Peloponnesian War and in particular the Melian Dialogue)  The other major schools of thought are Constructivism (conflict and cooperation are based on constructed, often cultural, groupings of identities) and Liberalism/Liberal Institutionalism (can be traced back to Woodrow Wilson, the League of Nations, etc., and based around the idea that conflict can be prevented and competition can be regulated through agreements and institutions, such as treaties, trade agreements, or shared memberships in international organizations).

Addiction and Dependence aren't two different phenomena. They're two competing models for understanding the same phenomenon.   Addiction is what the people in the 12 Step programs, and by extension, ASAM talk about as a disease caused by a combination of genetics and environmental factors. They define it as progressive, incurable, and often deadly. That second one is why people in AA and NA will say they're ""recovering alcoholics/addicts,"" because they believe that once you're an addict, you're always an addict. The full ASAM definition of addiction can be found here  Drug Dependence is a DSM-IV diagnosis from the American Psychiatric Association. It has much less detail than the ASAM definition, but is much less controversial since the APA makes no claim that anything in the DSM is a real disease state. They're pretty much just syndromes (clusters of symptoms that occur in conjunction with each other). They don't define an etiology (basically a mechanism through which the symptoms are caused). In any case, this classification will be completely obsolete within the year, as DSM-5 will soon be in effect across the country, which changes it from two separate diagnoses (Substance Abuse and Substance Dependence) to a single diagnosis with a bunch of specifiers that you can tack on to give a more specific picture of what's going on with that person. Technically, they have a fairly comprehensive section on substance use disorders for each drug, but ultimately, they share similar criteria.  DSM-IV-TR Criteria  I can't find a good resource for the DSM-5 criteria online, which shouldn't be surprising. DSM-5 is a pretty expensive book, and the APA wants you to spend your hundred bucks on it (150 for hard cover).

Temporal Linkages in Violent and Nonviolent Criminal Activity. Journal of Quantitative Criminology. 21(2), 149-174. Research on the temporal distribution of criminal behavior has highlighted two distinct mechanisms-population heterogeneity and state dependence. Most of this work indicates that long-term patterns of criminal offending reflect a mixture of stable individual differences and the causal effect of life events and experiences. Yet several ambiguities remain. Among the most important of these problems is whether both population heterogeneity and state dependence processes operate for different types of offending. We use longitudinal official record and self-report data for violent and non-violent offending activity from the Rochester Youth Development Study to address these ambiguities.  Weijer, Steve; Bijleveld, Catrien; Blokland, Arjan. 2014. The Intergenerational Transmission of Violent Offending. Journal of Family Violence 29 (2): 109-18. The current study examines the intergenerational transmission and concentration of violent offending using conviction data of 3,440 persons from three consecutive generations from the Dutch Transfive study. Violent offending is more concentrated within nuclear families than non-violent offending, and the intergenerational transmission of violent offending is stronger than the intergenerational transmission of non-violent offending. Due to the low prevalence of violent offending by women, only transmission from father to son is studied. Paternal violent offending before the birth of the son does not increase the son's risk to become violent, while paternal violent offending during the son's childhood and adolescence does. These results suggest that exposure to paternal violence plays an important role in the intergenerational transmission of violent offending.  Kerr, Sharon Lamoyne. 1999. An Exploratory Analysis of Risk Factors for Criminal Violence by Women (dissertation). One hundred and sixty-seven female inmates participated in an investigation of violent crime correlates. The relative lack of empirical evidence about female violent offending compared to that for males prompted this study. Risk and protective factors associated with violence were identified from the empirical literature then analyzed with stepwise logistic regression as predictors of conviction for violent crime. Contrary to expectations, intelligence and parental criminality did not significantly contribute to the prediction of a conviction for a violent crime. The significant predictors with a positive association with conviction for a violent crime included intoxication at time of current crime, 21 years old or younger at time of crime, depressive symptoms at time of data collection, and a childhood history of sexual abuse. The significant negative associations with conviction for violent crime included having not been raised by both biological parents, drug addiction, anxiety symptoms at time of data collection, mother's substance abuse, and previous incarcerations. Furthermore, four of these predictors met additional statistical criteria, in terms of magnitude of the odds ratio and variance, qualifying each as either a risk or protective factor. The risk factors (odds ratios $/ge$ 2) included intoxication at time of crime and being younger than 21 years at time of crime. The protective factors (odds ratios $/le$.5) included having not been raised by both biological parents and previous incarcerations. These results provide additional evidence that contributes to clarifying the similarities and differences in the backgrounds of male and female violent offenders, suggesting that there may be important gender differences in the development of violent behavior, specifically the developmental roles of childhood physical abuse and sexual abuse. In addition, differential effects on risk for violent crime conviction were observed for different kinds of substance abuse by both the participants and by their parents."

Cognitive-Behavioral Rehabilitation for High-Risk Violent Offenders: An Outcome Evaluation of the Violence Prevention Unit. Journal of Interpersonal Violence 20 (12),  1611-1627. Rehabilitation programs for adult violent offending are still novel, and few published studies examine the recidivism outcomes of those who complete such programs. This study describes a New Zealand prison program for high-risk violent men. The program is intensive and cognitive behavioral. Preliminary outcome data are presented for three indices during 2 or more years of follow-up: nonviolent reconviction, violent reconviction, and subsequent imprisonment in comparison with untreated offenders, treated men were less likely to be reconvicted of a violent offense, and those who were took longer to fail. There was also a 12% difference in favor of the treated men on the two other indices, nonviolent reconviction and reimprisonment. The authors conclude that the program shows early promise and that further evaluation with a larger sample of treated men will be important in clarifying whether the program is having a differential impact on violent versus nonviolent offending.   Van Dorn, R.A. Williams, J.H. 2003. Correlates associated with escalation of delinquent behavior in incarcerated youths. Social Work 48 (4), 523-531. This study investigated the extent to which attitudes, family, and environmental correlates are associated with the escalation from nonviolent to violent offending among incarcerated youths. Escalation was defined as an adjudicated violent offense only after arrests and adjudicationsexclusively for nonviolent offenses. Data were collected from 50 respondents (25 escalators and 25 maintainers of nonviolent offending) incarcerated in a secure facility in the Midwestern United States. Beliefs that power equates safety and a violent home environment were salient understandingescalation in offending behavior, and prior criminal victimization was moderately significant. Implications for individual and family preventive interventions and delinquency theories are discussed.   Eddy, J. Mark; Whaley, Rachel Bridges; Chamberlain, Patricia. 2004. The Prevention of Violent Behavior by Chronic and Serious Male Juvenile Offenders: A 2-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Clinical Trial. Journal of Emotional & Behavioral Disorders 12 (1), 2-9. Over the past several decades, an increasing number of youth have been incarcerated for violent offenses. Existing interventions for serious offenders target the prevention of subsequent delinquent behavior in general, rather than the prevention of violent behavior in particular. Within the context of a randomized clinical trial of 79 adolescent males involved in the juvenile justice system, we examine the ability of multidimensional treatment foster care (MTFC) to prevent subsequent violent offending relative to service-as-usual group home care (GC). Data on offending were collected every 6 months for a 2-year period following entry into the study. The method of generalized estimating equations was used to analyze the data. Results indicate that MTFC youth were significantly less likely to commit violent offenses than youth placed in services-as-usual group care. The group effect held even after control variables, including age at placement, age at first arrest, official and self-reported prior offenses, and time since baseline, were introduced into the model. Twenty-four percent of GC youth had two or more criminal referrals for violent offenses in the 2 years following baseline versus only 5% of MTFC youth. The rates of self-reported violent offending for MTFC youth were in the normative range following baseline, whereas rates for GC youth were 4 to 9 times higher. MTFC were also significantly less likely to report incidents of common violence, such as hitting. Results affirm once again the power of structured, problem-focused, multimodal interventions to change anti-social trajectories of juvenile offenders (Lipsey, 1992). Further, the results point to the importance of the family in terms of making a difference in the behavior of youth (see Reid, Patterson, & Snyder, 2002).' MTFC and MST are 'less costly and effective alternatives for incarceration.  Mooney, Jessica L.; Daffern, Michael. 2015. The relationship between aggressive behaviour in prison and violent offending following release. Psychology, Crime & Law.  21 (4), 314-329. Aggression during incarceration impacts on parole release decisions. However, research examining the link between aggressive behaviour in custody and violence post-release is limited, particularly in relation to adult violent offenders. Several factors complicate the use of institutional aggression as a marker of risk for future violence, including environmental causes of aggressive behaviour and adaptation to prison. This study explored the association between aggressive behaviour in prison and violent recidivism post-release in a sample of 148 adult male violent offenders. Prisoners with three or more aggressive incidents recorded in prison incurred a violent charge more often and sooner after release than those with no aggressive incidents, when controlling for age, ethnicity, length of incarceration and risk for future violence. Subjects with one or two aggressive incidents were not at increased risk of violent recidivism. These findings suggest that institutional aggression can be used to identify individuals at risk of violence following release but only when repeated aggressive behaviour is evident. Importantly, some prisoners who were not aggressive in prison were charged with violent offences post-release and some prisoners with three or more aggressive incidents were not violent following release, highlighting the complexity of using in-prison aggression as a marker for violent recidivism."
AskSocialScience,3dcm0a,MrWigggles,158,Wed Jul 15 05:37:15 2015 UTC,"A great definition of moral panic can be found on Garland (2008) warning pdf and by the criteria outlined by the author, I would say yes with the caveat that on the section that I am about to quote, he is reviewing other people's definitions of a moral panic and these definitions all imply the participation of the media (understood here as the non-Internet media, which is a very important distinction because these other, older media have a more important role as a gatekeeper of information and opinion) and they all involve authority figures such as the government, religious figures and so forth. So Paogate might not fit the definition exactly, but we'll just pretend that none of that stuff exists just because Reddit is a part of a different kind of medium.  Anyhoo, the five key features that Garland finds on another text are:   (i) concern (some reported conduct or event sparks anxiety); (ii) hostility (the perpetrators are portrayed as folk devils); (iii) consensus (the negative social reaction is broad and uniﬁed); (iv) disproportionality (the extent of the conduct, or the threat it poses, are exaggerated); (v) volatility (the media’s reporting and the associated panic emerge suddenly, but can dissipate quickly too). (p. 11)   One and two are extremely clear throughout, the hostility part being really evident in all those Chairman Pao posters. Three is a matter of debate, because it seems like Ellen Pao had pockets of very fervent support, and a whole many people were indifferent to the whole thing or were more worried about pointing out the exaggeration in the response than about joining the panic. Five is definitely true (after FatPeopleHate was banned, the first page of /r/all was nothing but fat people hate posts and Ellen Pao posts... for a day).  But number four is the most notable of them all because the disproportionality of the reaction to Pao's actions is intimately linked to the two criteria that Garland himself adds to these five. The new criteria are:   (i) the moral dimension of the social reaction, particularly the introspective soul-searching that accompanies these episodes; and (ii) the idea that the deviant conduct in question is somehow symptomatic.   So of course, there was a moral dimension (""Pao is against free speech!"") and whatever actions were taken by Reddit's admins were made to be a symptom of a larger problem (""Reddit is going full SJW!"").  So, to cut this short - maybe you didn't have an academic definition in mind while asking the question - I sure didn't know such definitions actually existed (even though they seem very useful now that I read Garland), but it's interesting that reddit's reaction to fatpeoplehate being banned and to Victoria being fired fit the definition of a moral panic kinda snugly."

AskSocialScience,3damni,blueberry_crepe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:26:51 2015 UTC,"No, but there are other languages that do differentiate between these sounds. Where mixing up these sounds changes the meaning of the word. And English speakers can't even tell the difference between them without lots of training and effort.  Between most pairs of two languages that are different enough, you will find sounds that differentiate meaning in one that are near indistinguishable to native speakers of the other.  Concrete examples:   Spanish ""rr"" sounds like English ""r"" to English speakers, but English ""d"" sounds closer to Spanish ""rr"" to Spanish speakers. The French ""r"" and the German ""x"" (I think they're approximately the same sound) aren't present in the English language and English speakers have a hard time learning these consonants."
AskSocialScience,3damni,myncknm,0,Wed Jul 15 17:01:18 2015 UTC,"Ok, but just to nitpick, I don't think ""rr"" is hard to understand for English speakers. It's common knowledge that Spanish uses the rolliing r, and everyone I know can recognize it"

AskSocialScience,3d84gz,yupko,37,Tue Jul 14 06:39:01 2015 UTC,"I think you may be misunderstanding imperialism, and using it in a way that is common in certain types of (generally far left) political rhetoric but that's separate from the way empires are discussing in historical-comparative social science, generally. For example, many analysis have looked at the Soviet Union (and perhaps even the post-Soviet Russian Federation, though that's certainly more debatable) as continuing on an ""imperial"" model (as opposed to a strict nation-state model or a civic ""state-nation"" model like the U.S. or India--the imperial model is about how the center deals with diverse groups of people within its borders). There's even analysis of the early Soviet Union called Affirmative Action Empire, about how minorities were given career benefits within the country, which suggests that not all things social scientists call empires we'd call racist.  We do see empire associated with what could be called racism. For example, the journalist Gershom Gorenberg has a pretty good history of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza called The Accidental Empire. This is of course complicated though because Arabs who are Israeli citizens, Arabs from East Jerusalem who are permanent legal residents of Israel, and Arabs from the Palestinian Territories are all treated differently by Israeli law. They're not treated ""as a race"", but there are hugely varied treatments based on citizenship status.  If we look at ethnic cleansing incidents since the 60's (as a way to get at at least one kind of ""racism""), I feel like we rarely see them in places we'd call imperial (Karen Barkey, in Empire of Difference, argues imperial rule and management of diverse populations for centuries led to stability rather than instability). Yugoslavia was an ethno-federal ""state-nation"", Rwanda was a post-colonial state which tried to enforce a civic identity but got riven apart by ethnic politics (interestingly, since 1994, they've had stability by making it essentially illegal to discuss ethnic difference and only allowing a single, unified ""Rwandan"" civic identity). Burma is a complex state with a lot of minorities, but I'm not sure anyone would call it imperial. The state and non-state actors have long been engaged in a campaign against the Rohinga minority, arguing that they're not really Burmese and should be expelled ""back"" to Bangladesh. You saw similar ethnic attacks on ethic Vietnamese in Burma in the 70's, ethnic Chinese in Indonesia and Malaysia since the 60's. In the end, it's not really ""imperialism"" that drives these sort of (alarmingly frequent) attacks, but a sort of ""nationalism"". This ""nationalism"" is not necessarily based on a single ethno-linguistic culture identity, but can come in diverse forms based on some identity that people argue has unique claims to the state. In India, Indonesia, Iraq and Burma, for example, this identity is partially religiously based (Hindu nationalism against Muslim, Muslim nationalism against the mostly Confucian and Buddhist Chinese, Shi'a and Sunnis against each other, Buddhists against Muslims, respectively). In Yugoslavia, we saw people who essentially spoke the same language attacking people over ""religious differences"" when relatively few of them were what we might recognize as religiously observant. In Sudan, we saw Christians and animists in what's now South Sudan fighting the Arab Muslim regime in Khourtam based on a combination of religious, racial, and ethnic identity, but you also saw the fighting between Muslim groups in Darfur that was based on racial identity (as well as the identity of settled agriculture vs pastoralists). Imperialism isn't the lens through which these sorts of ""racial""/""ethnic""/identity-based incidents are played out.   Most people who talk about the negative consequences of ""modern imperialism"" generally think in terms of dependency theory. Transnational economic marginalization and exploitation is the focus, more than the racism within a sovereign state.  Edit: I should add that in the above examples I focused on ethic violence mostly within ethnic states. Racism within settler colonies (Australia, the U.S., Latin America, etc), where there is generally some sense of racial caste system, is generally treated separately. Racism in countries with few marginalized indigenous minorities and large recent migrant populations--particularly Western European countries like Sweden, France, and the UK--are also generally treated differently, though as that literature emerged it's always been in conversation with the U.S.-based migration literature (though the European literature tends to discuss ""integration"" and the U.S. literature tends to discuss ""assimilation""). There have been some attempts to put all these literatures together (a recent example would probably be Andreas Wimmer's ""The Making and Unmaking of Ethnic Boundaries: A Multi-Level Process), but this impulse hasn't really been picked up on as much as it should be and generally the literatures don't talk to each other. Again, these focus on what's going on between groups (racial, ethnic, religious, etc) within the national state, but don't talk about imperialism. Work on imperialism like you seem to mean focuses much more on words like ""the Global South"", ""dependency"", ""core-periphery"" relationships in the ""world economy"" (i.e. work coming out of Wallerstein), and the ever popular ""neoliberalism"". This work focuses primarily on international economic, rather than domestic racial or ethnic, relationships. Some of it ties the two together (for example, Saskia Sassen's The Global City) by looking at ethnic migration and ethnicized division of labor within global cities, but this generally isn't called imperialism, either.   There's also, as I mentioned at the beginning, a rich historical comparative literature on empire, but that's also about empire (the Ottoman, Soviet, French, British, American, Russian, Japanese, etc empires in comparative perspective) more than imperialism. This last literature has had greater interest since September 11th and the Iraq War in particular (for example, you can look at the apologist for empire Niall Ferguson's Empire as perhaps the most widely read--and poorly received by other academics--example of this trend)."

AskSocialScience,3d84gz,yodatsracist,12,Tue Jul 14 10:05:42 2015 UTC,"So, I should be working (I'm currently on a research trip), and therefore my responses may be short.     Thank you for the very detailed response. I was not aware that imperialism, in non-political contexts, was not necessarily associated with racism. Is imperialism seen as a largely organizational phenomenon/administrative model only in historical-comparative social science, or also in fields like cultural anthropology? (In other words, do cultural anthropologists use ""imperialism"" referring to entities with racist policies? I thought I had read an anthropology focused Latin American history book that used the term ""imperialism"" that way, but maybe it was ""colonialism"" instead.)   That sort of association between imperialism and racism was very important to the first half of the twentieth century (see, for example, Franz Fanon's oevre) but by the 1960's and 1970's, most colonized countries in Africa and Asia had been decolonized (there's a huge wave of independence movements really starting with India and Pakistan in 1946 and I don't know when you'd want to say it ended, but maybe with independence for Angola [1975] and Black-rule in Zimbabwe [1980]).  Things were different in other regions: Pacific Islands gained their full independence slightly later, and Spanish-speaking continental Latin American gained its independence early in the 19th century.  Since the 1960's and 1970's, complaints about ""imperialism"" is not literal rule, but a more general sort of ""interference"" especially with the domestic economy or foreign policy (many countries in the various socialist blocs, for example, considered the Vietnam War and America's embargo on Cuba to be ""imperialism"", for example).  Since this period, neo-colonialism has probably been the more popular academic term for this sort of thing.  Again, it's generally used by academics associated with the far left.  It particularly focuses on the role of multinational corporations in extracting both cheap labor and resources.   Are there any historical events that are used by proponents of dependency theory or the Global South theory, as an example of a first world nation taking advantage of a nation in the ""Global South"" for these more economic focused imperialist goals? US support/control of banana republics? British Suez Crisis?   Again, it's the corporations that people tend to emphasize these days, as far as I've read, not the states themselves.  That said, it's not always corporations.  One of the things that people have been emphasizing in the last ten years or so is China's changing relationship with the rest of the world, particularly Southeast Asia and Africa.  The globalization literature is strongest on this stuff, and the event that they point to, often, for the start of ""Neoliberalism"" is the 1973 Oil Crisis, which lead to a lot of stagnation world wide.  This led to cheaper ways to find labor, which led to ""offshoring"" of labor, which led to changing legal agreements including reduced tariffs generally; free trade agreements (in America, the most famous is NAFTA); and special industrial zones in many countries in the Global South where local tax, labor, and even environmental laws might apply differently.  When I teach a globalization class, we use Saskia Sassen's Cities in a World Economy as a sort of textbook which teaches what's going on.  I suspect you'd find it interesting.  It's meant to be a textbook and I'm sure you could find the last edition (the third) cheap online.  She's a leftist sociologist but appreciated by a lot economists (Joe Stieglitz is the one who brought here to Columbia).  David Harvey's A Brief History of Neoliberalism is another book on the subject of neoliberalism and globalization that a lot of people recommend (his is probably the most famous radical critique; he's also close with Sassen).  Economists, even left leaning economists, would point out that this trade has generally increased standard of living in much of the less developed world.  For a good introduction to how this kind of trade works from a economists perspective, Paul Krugman's ""Ricardo's Difficult Idea"".  He's left leaning and in favor of regulation, but a right leaning economist might give a very similar answer. A heterodox economist, and others like radical geographers, might point to the question of, despite standards of living, ""Why do developing countries never develop?""  For more on this, see the middle income trap (actually, the Wiki article is bad on that--there's more better stuff elsewhere).  See also maybe 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism by Ha-Joon Chang (he's a fairly radical but well respected heterodox economist, not just a left leaning one).  Full text is here, I guess.  Again, most of this literature focuses on the economy, not race.  You'll see implications of racism all over, but that's almost always secondary to the rich-poor, center-periphery dynamic (of course, the racial ideology of European colonialism is one of the things that gave us the center and periphery of the World Economy in the first place, but it plays, if any, a much diminished role).    Again, though, I'll just point out in the place where I am, the place that I'm currently researching in , I have ethnographies by the same anthropologist that explicitly say (this is a paraphrase), ""The biggest change in village life is how much richer everyone has become.  In the 1950's, there were people who were hungry and in rags.  In the 1980's, no one was hungry, and no one was in rags.""  A some of this new wealth came improved agricultural practices (tractorization, industrial fertilizers), but a lot of it came from remittances from family members who worked in the nearest big city, often in factories or in construction.  Industrialization and globalization is is what did that, whatever else it did.  That's a common story worldwide, and one that economists are right to point to (not to say that the critics are wrong, either).   What are some more examples of racist policies at the nation-level, post-1960s, in civic nation states like the US, Australia, and so on rather than ethnic states? US examples that come to mind would be the Tuskegee experiment and the War on Drugs. Have the governments of Canada, Australia, or Latin American nations done similar things in the recent past?   In America, the current on people focus on is mass incarceration (intimately related to the war on drugs).  See The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander is the most popular book on this.  The Wikipedia seems very thorough, and she's also given a lot of good interviews if you don't have time to read the book.  Her interview on the podcast ""Office Hours"" I think was pretty good.    If you want to bring in Hispanics as well, and how they fit into the ""American racial caste system"", Eduardo Bonilla-Silva's Racism without Racists is very popular.    In Canada, the big issues are often around the Residential Schools.  There are on-going protests related to indigenous issues in Canada under the name Idle No More.  For Australia, most of the work has been done on Aboriginal Issues; see for example the Stolen Generations.  There's been less work done, as far as I know, on the very interesting ethnicized and racialized system of Australia (roughly White Australians, ""Wogs"", ""Lebanese"" and Asians, Aboriginals).  For the origins of this, see the White Australia policy, which lasted until the 1960's (which is the same time the U.S. reopened its borders to wider immigration).  There have been a variety of racial incidents in Australia: the Cronulla Riots in 2005, Mandatory Detention, etc. etc.  There have also been several incidents where aboriginal men have been killed by police or died in police custody, see the Redfern riots and the Palm Island death in custody.  And these are after a Royal Commission on Deaths in Custody.  Indigenous populations actually vary hugely throughout Latin America.  There are almost none in Argentina (>2%), and almost all of Paraguay has some indigenous heritage (95% Mestizo), to pick the two extremes.  I'm not particularly familiar with the details of all the individual countries, but there's a reason Evo Morales is seen as a ""Bolivian Obama"" and why there's been a decades long rebellion in the Mexican state of Chiapis (like many such rebel movements, the rebellion involves both ethnic identity and economic grievances--the literature on ethnic violence tends to emphasize that ethnic groups rebel not because they have a separate identity, but because they're kept out of power).   Are there works that focus both on old imperialism and dependency theory, comparing the effects of the conquest focused British and French ""empires"" to the effects of economic/indirect intervention focused American and Soviet ""empires""?   I'm sure there are, but except for ""big books"" by Wallerstein and the like, who is the key guy for World-Systems theory, I can't think of any.  Oh, I knew only Wallerstein's huge, multivolume books, but he also apparently published a single volume one synopsis in 2004 called, World-Systems Analysis: An Introduction.  His work is interesting but imperfect, I'd say is the general consensus, though there are some real true believers out there."

If it is strictly self-reported questionnaires for correlational research with no manipulation, then I entirely agree. However, if the researchers are interested in a causal manipulation and have no reason to suspect different groups (e.g. genders or races) reacting differently to the manipulation and simply want to test if the manipulation works, then there should be nothing wrong with using an anonymous self-selected online sample for hopefully the first of many studies."

AskSocialScience,3d5xct,Kraftz,7,Tue Jul 14 04:29:30 2015 UTC,"I believe you're conflating concepts.  Randomization concerns the sampling procedure used by the researcher, as in how they choose respondents (in the case of a survey). The question is whether or not all potential respondents (of the target population) have the same probability of being part of the sample, not whether or not they'll all answer.   While we do remain in the realm of validity, response rates are another can of worms, concerning the non-response bias. If we had a low response rate (e.g. 20%), yes, our suvey could be considered to be practically based upon a self-selected sample. But not all surveys have such low rates.  In summary, if we have a high enough response rate, we can have a probability sample which can be considered valid."
AskSocialScience,3d5xct,Kraftz,3,Tue Jul 14 06:23:22 2015 UTC,"Whatever method you choose is going to have pros and cons. For an anonymous survey, you have some pros:   easier to get a large sample size with less effort relatively low cost (depends partly on if you pay participants) if the service is good, data can be provided to you in an already analyzable format (depending on if you need extra coding, of course)   The cons:   self selecting sample (as pointed out by /u/surprisesugarfree ), though this isn't always an issue uncertainty in the data. Online, people can lie about their demographic info, have other people help them, etc, without your knowledge   I think mostly the downsides of using an online survey are things you should mention in your discussion, but they aren't always dealbreakers. It's all a matter of what trade-offs you need to do."

Several researchers who use this method will even put in questions designed to ensure you aren't just marking random answers.   The Amazon MechanicalTurk program is full of surveys and such that use qualtrics, surveymonkey,etc. for small studies. Yes, participants get paid, but it's not usually more than $5. It's often around the $0.50 mark. It's common in academic institutions because it's easier to get a bunch of people to participate online than to get them to respond using paper flyers. Especially if it's for a study occurring during the summer when students aren't abundant on campus.

AskSocialScience,3d14ii,Liesmith,24,Sun Jul 12 17:31:15 2015 UTC,"I think that framing this question as ""psychologists were implanting false memories of satanic abuse in people in the 80s"" is not the best way to approach this issue, in that it implies that the professionals in question were aware that the memories were false and were implanting them on purpose, and I've never seen any evidence that that was the case. What most likely happened is that common therapeutic techniques at that time, such as using leading questions and techniques such as RMT (recovered memory therapy), hypnosis, and certain drug-assisted therapies that have since been debunked, resulted in clients confabulating memories of ritualized abuse and the clinicians rendering themselves unable to differentiate between real memories and the confabulated ones (due the bias intrinsic to those methods). Source from back then.  As for my own experience, I finished my Master's in Social Work in 2013, and in my practice classes, we were all specifically cautioned about using leading questions and any therapeutic techniques that presuppose the existence of repressed memories, especially with children and people who may have experienced childhood trauma due to the risk of them confabulating memories. The Satanic Panic and daycare trials were mentioned as cautionary tales of what happens when well-meaning clinicians/social workers use questionable techniques to obtain information. So, those beliefs and techniques were obviously common enough to where they caused an awful lot of trouble for everyone and resulted in several studies debunking the methodologies involved, to the point where newbie clinicians are being warned against using them twenty-plus years later.   That said, I was born in 1984, so I obviously have no personal or professional recollection of these events.

It's on youtube if you are interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEKJSOrctcY.   Science on subliminal messages has shown that you can indeed change someone's feeling or opinion about something. The problem is that the effect of the message diminishes significantly the more complex it is and the longer it has been since the subject was exposed to the message. For instance, you might be able to coerce a person into prefering blue over red after having them watch videos that associate red with brief flashes (fractions of a second) with disgusting things like trash, rats, etc. You cannot, however, change how someone votes in a political election because the decision is a complex one that incorporates too many factors, requires more concentration and diliberate action, and any miniscule effect would wear off by the time the person voted.

On the cost structure side, the answer to this question is somewhat complex, ideally you would conduct analysis by sector. But from the more general economics side, the answer is almost undoubtedly yes. The internet reduces the role of informational asymmetry in creating deviations from competitive outcomes . That's a somewhat obtuse idea, so consider a real world application in the market for used cares. Before the internet, the market for lemons created numerous allocative inefficiencies. Now, using the internet you can look up the price/quality of any used car anywhere in the country. The ability to look up prices from multiple retailers creates competitive price pressure. Before the internet, used car dealers relied on lack of ability to observe other prices for similar cars to exert market power. A similar, and perhaps more salient, example is the airline industry. Today you can use Expedia to browse price listings of every carrier that runs the route your going to fly, any time. Because you are fully informed as to what other sellers charge, and will pay the lowest price (particularly because seats are homogeneous within their class), airlines are forced to price against one another. To this day, cyclical average net profits for airlines are minuscule. So in sum, yes the internet works to increase price competition because it remedies one of the classical market failures: informational asymmetry."

AskSocialScience,3cpzq9,Polisskolan2,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:43:30 2015 UTC,"That answer would depend somewhat on the size of fixed costs relative to marginal costs. Honestly the IO side of this is somewhat complex, solving for equilibrium number of firms in perfect competition requires a cost function and a demand curve at the very least. It gets more complex when you add in potential for predatory/preemptive pricing, or if you use game theory analysis. The short answer is probably not, as equilibrium price should cover average cost.

I guess this is the crux of my confusion when it comes to cultural appropriation, specifically in regards to martial arts:   My art is Kyukoshin Karate, which was developed by Masutasu Oyama (born Choi Yeong-eui), a Korean man. He took the karate he learned, and by all accounts of his era, improved it, codified it, and moved to Japan to teach his style of Karate to the native Japanese.  His teacher was Gichin Funakoshi, a Japanese main-lander, who went to the island of Okinawa (a distinct culture of its own), learned their fighting art (called ""Te""), changed it, brought it back to mainland and started to teach mainlanders what is commonly thought of as Karate.  Going further back the records start to get very blurry, but all accounts seem to indicate that Okinawan ""Te"" was derived from Chinese fighting methods, which (very fuzzy at this point) may have in fact come from India.    To your original point, no, I don't fetishize Japan or Karate. I think such behaviors and beliefs are crass, bordering on racist.

A primary problem is that the collection rate of taxes in Greece is low  What is happening is that Greece spent more than it made for a long time, this was in part because of the taxes and also because they wanted to provide pensions, etc for their workers.    This blog post from WSJ goes over it a little but also points out that one of the problems is that Greece has a larger share of people collecting pensions than some others in the EU.    Although Germany has dealt with this issue by raising the age to collect pensions to 67.    Lots of other issues are around but really it boils down to Greece was able to spend more money than it should have since it was able to borrow on the EU's credit rating once it was part of the EU.  The framework was in place for this downfall for awhile, but large borrowing just allowed it to continue.  Greece's economy has shrunk as well since the first borrowing (5 years ago when this all started) so they have not recovered as much as everyone had thought.  Although the rest of the PIGS have.    This is a pretty simplistic overview but some of the links here will allow you to get more in-depth.   Although some would argue that the Euro, or at least the inability of the EU to control fiscal as well as monetary policy is the root of the problem.  The video on the Vox site goes into that.    In general trying to blame one specific thing for any complex system is generally not true, or only partially true.

You seek asylum once you have already gotten to another country (and have the resources to have done so).

I understand that a large portion of asylum seekers these days come from cultures where all the influence is in the hands of men, so it makes sense that more men would be seeking asylum because they would be a greater threat to those in power back home, thus would be more in need of asylum.  Women may be just as likely to be refugees in such cultures, but they would presumably be far less likely to be seen as politically relevant (or even be allowed to express themselves publicly at all), and so are less likely to be in a position to need asylum in the first place.  There is also the simple fact that women are far less likely to travel at all, especially illegally, as they face far greater risk of victimization of all kinds."
AskSocialScience,3ch0gf,PeppyHare66,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:13:44 2015 UTC,"Asylum seekers generally are granted refugee status when they are granted asylum; ""asylum seeker"" is a temporary label that either turns into ""refugee"" or ""(illegal) immigrant"" based on the determination of the host country after they assess whether they have a valid legal claim to asylum.   I work with asylum seekers in the Netherlands, and a distinct trend that I'm noticing is that Syrian men are much more common than women among asylum seekers - because they are the ones who are (perceived to be) more capable of making the treacherous trip from Syria to the EU, while the women are seen as the caregivers whose responsibility is to look after their children. However, once they receive their (temporary) refugee status, a large number of them immediately apply for family reunification - a right granted under Article 8 of the ECHR whereby dependents and spouses are granted refugee status and are given plane tickets straight to the Netherlands.   It could well be the case that the wives of those former asylum seekers turned refugees are not counted as asylum seekers, since they've been granted asylum before they enter EU territory.  Another explanation for the higher level of male asylum seekers could be that men tend to have a higher chance at receiving asylum. Most Syrians, irrespective of gender, receive asylum almost immediately because they are fleeing a war zone. Potential refugees from other countries, however, have to prove that they are facing persecution upon return. Male asylum seekers from Eritrea, another country that supplies a large chunk of refugees, are more likely to meet this criteria because all Eritrean men are forced into military service. Those who avoid service or abandon service face torture and other HR violations. Women are not required to serve.   Another reason for women disappearing from refugee statistics could be the fact that human smugglers employ different strategies based on the gender of their clients. Men who enter Europe with the aid of human smugglers often pay for their trip in cash, or have their family/community back home pay for them. They often continue paying while working in the host country, legally or illegally. Applying for asylum is a valid strategy for men, because if it succeeds, they might get benefits and state support. If it fails, they can still stay in the country illegally and find some employment.   Women, however, fairly often are funneled into the sex industry by the human smugglers straight away. Since the sex industry/trade is illegal in many countries, and human smugglers would face prosecution if their involvement is discovered, human smugglers are disincentivized from having their clients enter the formal system by applying for asylum. These women could well be actual refugees, but they remain invisible in the statistics.  Finally, I wonder if you have looked at the statistics for asylum seekers/refugees in the countries where most refugees end up. You only quote EU statistics, but the vast majority of refugees end up in the region - in the case of Syria/Iraq, this would be Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, etc. Look up the figures for asylum seekers/refugees in those three countries, and I bet the gender ratios are more equal."

AskSocialScience,3cetxq,chromeqz,70,Tue Jul 7 10:38:14 2015 UTC,"It is a huge problem, but the US has a fairly rational system of federal insurance and risk transfers, entitlement and infrastructure spending, etc. that mitigate the worst effects on the states that arise from using an 'external' currency.   Krugman for example writes about the 1980s Savings & Loan scandal. Thumbnail summary and full audit reports here:   During the 1980s, the savings and loan industry experienced severe financial losses because extremely high interest rates caused institutions to pay high rates on deposits and other funds while earning low yields on their long-term loan portfolios. During this period, regulators reduced capital standards and allowed the use of alternative accounting procedures to increase reported capital levels. While these conditions were occurring, institutions were allowed to diversify their investments into potentially more profitable, but risky, activities. The profitability of many of these activities depended heavily on continued inflation in real estate values to make them economically viable. In many cases, diversification was accompanied by inadequate internal controls and noncompliance with laws and regulations, thus further increasing the risk of these activities.  As a result of these factors, many institutions experienced substantial losses on their loans and investments, a condition that was made worse by an economic downturn.     Sound familiar?   Krugman points out that around 60% of the S&L losses occurred in Texas, which amounted to about $75 billion in direct federal aid to that one state. Krugman points out that this aid wasn't in the form of loans that Texas had to pay back, nor did the government assume an equity stake in exchange for the aid; instead this was just an outright transfer of capital from taxpayers to banks and their counterparties in order to bail them out of terrible high-risk investments. $75 billion at the time amounted to 25% of Texas' total GDP. Can you imagine Germany & France agreeing to simply grant 25% of Greece's pre-crisis GDP in Euros with few strings attached? Krugman remarks:    I think you can make a strong case that if Texas had been an independent country in 1986-87 it would have experienced a huge financial and fiscal crisis.     Indeed. So why did US taxpayers & Congress agree to this massive bailout for a single state? The answer is that they didn't, or not exactly. The bailout was basically automatic, as federal depository insurance corporations and regulators like FDIC, FSLIC, FHLBB and so forth stepped in to stop the bleeding before it could spread into an even wider bank crisis and recession. Later the FTC was created to unwind the accounts of several thousand ""zombie"" banks that collapsed during the crisis.   So one answer to your question is that the US has much stronger & more effective federal insurance provisions designed to mitigate bank failures, as well as other economic (and state budget) crises. In effect, taxpayers stand behind the banks of other states, ready to bail them out should the need arise. Some point out that this backing might create a moral hazard, effectively encouraging banks to make riskier investments because they know Uncle Sam will help them out when their schemes backfire. Others respond that this is the only effective way to stop a banking & liquidity crisis before it can become a full-blown economic depression, and that in exchange for insuring the investments of private banks, taxpayers should demand more effective regulation, accounting standards and stringent lending/investment rules.  TL;DR - US taxpayers are in general more willing to be generous when it comes to bailing out the state budgets and local economies of other states -- or at least the structure of federal & state government (particularly for example the power the US Senate gives to small states with low populations) give them little choice. This willingness to help, and a sense of good faith in general, is somewhat lacking in the EU."
AskSocialScience,3cetxq,jetpacksforall,6,Tue Jul 7 12:27:24 2015 UTC,"Adding on to this answer: Another way to create an optimal currency area is to have easy factor mobility, as labor and capital can move from where they are not being employed/utilized to where they are.

I'm not sure how we'd quantify it but we know for a fact that it's a fairly significant area in women's rights work with numerous incentives, programs and institutions set up specifically to help women into the area. If we take mining as a specific example, it's one of the longest running battles that women have been fighting, which has obviously continued in recent times and are now starting to make some progress.   So unless we can somehow quantify the differences in efforts (maybe money spent or amount of time designated to the promotional work in each area?), I think the better question is to ask why people are under the impression that there is a difference when there likely is no difference.   One possible explanation I can think of would be that discrimination in STEM gets more attention because 1) it's considered more 'liberal' than trade positions so we have an expectation that women might be treated more fairly and contradictions to that stick in our minds whereas hearing a builder unfairly rejected a woman seems almost standard, and 2) university-level jobs obviously attract wealthier people (in general) and so when they want to highlight a problem they have more resources available to do so.

The issue here is that your perception of things will likely be selective and skewed by a range of factors; e.g. the people you talk to, the communities you hang out in, whether you're male or female, etc.   For example, if someone were to hang out in ""mens rights"" type communities then you'll likely only hear about STEM things because they're the most noticeable. They're talked about on Twitter, they make the headlines, etc, so they're easy for people to get outraged over when they want to discredit something without actually dedicating the time to understanding things like gender inequality and the problems faced with workplace discrimination.

AskSocialScience,3cequr,jjolla888,4,Tue Jul 7 09:55:01 2015 UTC,"The biggest difference is population. Italy has 61 million people and Greece has 11 million people. So even if the average Greek was just as well off as the average Italian, the Italian economy would still be 5.5 times larger. A larger population means that Italy has a more diversified economy and a larger domestic consumer market. As such, Italy produces both a greater quantity and a greater variety of products.  Countries with smaller populations also face a different economic reality. A country the size of Italy can tolerate certain economic inefficiencies as it has the resources to offset such inefficiencies through government spending or protectionist practices. A country the size of Greece cannot tolerate such inefficiencies as they have fewer resources (e.g. fewer consumers, smaller tax base, less diverse economy). To prosper, small countries need to be competitive in the international market, which requires a stable political environment and the development of nascent industries. Other small European countries instituted a form of social corporatism, which is arrangement between the government, business, and labor wherein all work together on economic policies. Unfortunately for Greece, the political situation has never been stable enough to allow for such an arrangement.  While Italy is not always viewed as the most politically stable place, its post-WWII experience has been far more peaceful than in Greece. While the rest of Europe was rebuilding after the war, Greece was experiencing a civil war in which 158,000 people were killed. This left Greece with a highly acrimonious and unstable political atmosphere for next 20 years. In 1967 there was a military coup and the military remained in power until its collapse following a failed attempt at annexing Cyprus in 1974. Italy also experienced violence, referring the time period between 1968 and 1988 as the Years of Lead. However, this violence never led to the same kind of political instability as seen in Greece.  The result of all this is that Greece is poorly integrated into international markets. In other small European countries, trade as a percentage of GDP is 50+%. Prior to 2008, trade as a percentage of GDP in Greece hovered around 30%. When Greece finally did start to integrate into the European market, the result was that domestic producers were displaced by more efficient foreign producers. I can't find full information on Greece's balance of trade, but it appears that Greece had not had a positive balance of trade in the last 50 years."

AskSocialScience,3cdik5,themanwhosleptin,0,Tue Jul 7 01:49:35 2015 UTC,"I think, it's a bit more complicated.  Many if not most researchers consider religion a by-product of human mental faculties (a minority thinks it's an adaptation but I won't get into that). However, these intuitions are not distributed equally among individuals. For some people, non-belief comes more naturally.  For instance, Shenhav, Rand, and Greene (2012) reported that a small test of only three questions can predict to some degree whether or not you're religious. They call the ends of the continuum an intuitive and analytic style of thinking. People with a more analytic style of thinking are more likely to be non-religious, while people with a more intuitive style of thinking are more likely to become or remain religious.  But these styles of thinking may also have consequences for one's advancement in higher education. Analytic thinking is a norm here. Some people may have to suppress some of their intuitions. Some actually do, as was demonstrated by Kelemen, Rottman and Seston (2013): If you stress scientists, they fall back on intuitions that Kelemen calls promiscuous teleology – the tendency to see design and purpose.  An additional factor is that religiosity is strongly encouraged by what I call ""magical thinking about misfortune"". Other expressions are existential insecurity (Norris and Inglehart, 2004). Being able to advance in higher eduction (especially in the US) provides a stronger safety net, which makes it easier to be disinterested in religion.  Finally, one can mention a possible decline of credible demonstrations of religious beliefs (Henrich, 2009) when going to college; either due to time constraints, college culture, or other factors.  As a result, one should expect to see a negative correlation between higher education and religion. Neither the the content of one's education, nor its methodology, must have an influence on one's religious beliefs. The majority of scientific or philosophical findings do  not contradict religious statements, and it's possible to have more than just one tool in your toolbox.  However, the correlation can become stronger for some religions, due to their specific beliefs that may clash with the knowledge or the methods taught in some fields."

Increased productivity and technical change do not fall like mana from heaven.  For modelling purposes, it depends on what you want to model and why. If you're interested in business cycles, you might model growth as exogenous because you don't really care about the growth part of the model; it's just background noise. If you care about growth proper, then you certainly do want to have some story of endogenous technological change."

As far as I understand the issue, economists like Lucas and Romer weren't happy with the exogenous assumptions of Solow's model about technological advancement and the Harrod-Domar model with the savings rate. So they tried to endogenise things like technology.  Here is Romer's 1994 paper, and here is a 1990 paper also by Romer on endogenous technological change.   An instance of criticism would be a 1997 paper by Sachs and Warner claiming that endogenous growth models can't account for conditional convergence, while Krugman claims the model is practically impossible to empirically verify.   Does it just essentially come down to that growth is endogenous (because everything is endogenous to some degree at the macro level), but models which try to endogenise certain variables don't do a very good job of it?"
AskSocialScience,3cd8rs,alexhoyer,3,Tue Jul 7 13:45:32 2015 UTC,"With that framing in mind, here are some thoughts.  The exogenous growth models of Solow/Ramsey/Diamond were pretty successful in matching various high-level phenomena in growth: roughly constant growth in income per worker and capital per worker; roughly constant factor shares; wages roughly growing at the rate of production; roughly constant interest rates; conditional convergence.  However, the models were deeply unsatisfying in that, for being a theory of growth, there was awfully little theory about growth in the models. Indeed they would really be better characterized as capital accumulation models, not growth models.   So in the 1980s a bunch of people -- Lucas, Romer, Aghion, Howitt, Grossman, Helpman -- tried to dig deeper into the growth process. They wrote down some exciting models, and we thought we were getting closer to understanding the fundamentals of growth. Timing helped: economists wanted to understand the rise of Asia and the decline of Latin America, and business cycles had died down.   The New Growth Theory models solved some problems (we now had an idea of where growth came from) but introduced others (NGT models lacked  conditional convergence and had ugly scale effects that seem awfully counterfactual). People began to wonder whether the NGT models were bringing more benefits than costs. It wasn't clear where the literature was going. That was around the late 1990s and early 2000s.   In the mid-2000s, the NGT models had enough respectability that Diego Comin and Mark Gertler tried to graft business cycles into a NGT model. It was pretty cool, but sort of fizzled out.  Then the Great Recession happened and we all stopped worrying about growth, because we were more worried about the financial system melting down around us."
AskSocialScience,3c9jng,feplus,46,Mon Jul 6 03:54:10 2015 UTC,"First, I think you've either been misinformed about the main goal of the study, or you missed the forest for the tree. (Or maybe, I misunderstood your question.)  The goal of the study was to show that people use different moral principles according to their goals, so to say. People like or dislike certain conclusions and thus change their reasoning so they'll get the result they want. In other words, they act more like lawyers, not like (ideal) judges. This is sometimes called motivated reasoning.  The result of the study is in line with other research. For instance, Morgan, Mullen & Skitka (2010) demonstrated that people also attribute wrong behavior differently according to their political alliance. To explain this, I'd need to take a short detour.  Generally speaking, people often attribute morally wrong behavior to internal characteristics if that person is someone else. But if they themselves do something wrong, they tend to attribute this to external characteristics, ie. circumstance. This is called fundamental attribution error.  For instance, if someone ignores a red light in traffic, you're more likely to consider him reckless. If you yourself would ignore a red light, you'd probably attribute it to your circumstance – maybe, you've just had a fight with your spouse, or your car just made rumbling noises. It's not really your fault, because you were distracted.  This also happens when people have different roles such as perpetrator or victim. Victims often attribute the perpetrator's behavior on his or her internal characteristics. Perpetrators often mention the circumstances they were in. See Baumeister, Stillwell & Wotman (1990).  Now, Morgan, Mullen & Skitka (2010) above found that people also used different attribution depending on the moral and political values. Conservatives were more likely to attribute a perpetrator's behavior to their circumstance in the case of wrong-doings by policeman, and the military. They reason to get the result they want.  In the case of the study you mention, this is the same effect, only for moral principles. This is hardly surprising given what we know.  However, I agree that some remarks in the study are a bit problematic. I'm not a native English speaker but even I understand that a name like ""Chip Ellsworth III"" does not just encode race. I'd bet that people would also attribute things like ""wealth"" to such a name. Maybe, it also raises ideas about that guy being one of those who are responsible for wealth inequality? I found not hint in the original study that the names have been pre-tested.  The authors consider alternative explanations in section 5.2 of the paper, liking the result to other research. They write (emphasize by me):   Our Chip-Tyrone manipulation presented liberals with choices likely to alert their sensitivities to issues of racial inequality, and they responded more negatively when asked to sacrifice a Black life than a White life. Comparatively conservative participants, even if not overtly prejudiced, may simply have lacked these acute sensitivities regarding inequality, and responded in a more evenhanded fashion as a result.   Maybe, a native English speaker (or American) can join in, but I think the authors made a mistake by over-emphasizing race in this context, and by ignoring wealth inequality.  If you take these alternative interpretation of the data into account, the result is in line with other results about liberal morality. They are not biased against ""whites"", but against inequality (among other things), and race is but one of the possible signals for this inequality.  Hope this helps.  Edit: Another omission is the participants' possible attribution of political alliance to these names. If ""Chip Ellsworth III"" is a name that people would associate with political conservatism, the study merely says that liberals are more willing to throw a conservative under the bus (and visa versa) which is also what one would expect."

Needs some explanation, whether the names are indicative of race, class, politics, or some combination.

I'll nit-pick here a bit – Sorry! –, since this is not quite right.  The political affiliation is these studies was measured on uneven scales. Assuming political affiliation follows a normal distribution, we should expect to see an uneven mean in the whole sample if it's representative.  In study 1a, political orientation was measured on a 1-5 scale with an expected mean of 3. The mean for the participants (convenience sample of college students of social science) was 2.57. The authors note, this is slightly left of center. In study 1b, political orientation was measured on a 1-7 scale with an expected mean of 4. The sample mean (96 undergraduate students and 80 adults from a public area in Southern California) was 3.59. This is also slightly left of center, as the authors note.  In fact, the authors never write ""conservatives"" but: ""Liberals and (relatively) more conservatives"". I suspect, the two initial experiments lacked respondents who were really conservative. So, we should be a bit careful about generalizing.  That aside, the experimental conditions were not constructed to engage conservatives, I'd say. A key difference between those groups is their moral tuning – see moral foundations theory – which means both groups have other ""grant narratives"" which identifies different victims and perpetrators even if the facts are held constant.  For instance, the conservative grant narrative looks a bit like this (Drew Westen ""The Political Brain"" via Haidt, 2012):   Once upon a time, America was a shining beacon. Then liberals came along and erected an enormous federal bureaucracy that handcuffed the invisible hand of the free market. They subverted our traditional American values and opposed God and faith at every step of the way.… Instead of requiring that people work for a living, they siphoned money from hardworking Americans and gave it to Cadillac-driving drug addicts and welfare queens. Instead of punishing criminals, they tried to “understand” them. Instead of worrying about the victims of crime, they worried about the rights of criminals.… Instead of adhering to traditional American values of family, fidelity, and personal responsibility, they preached promiscuity, premarital sex, and the gay lifestyle … and they encouraged a feminist agenda that undermined traditional family roles.… Instead of projecting strength to those who would do evil around the world, they cut military budgets, disrespected our soldiers in uniform, burned our flag, and chose negotiation and multilateralism.… Then Americans decided to take their country back from those who sought to undermine it.   I suspect, if the authors would have altered the experiment in a way that would build on these grant narratives, we would have seen similar results. Chances are conservatives would not have thrown a ""hardworking"" American under the bus to save 100 ""welfare queens"", even if they might say that occupation should not play a role in moral judgments.  Edit: Opps, totally forgot to answer your question: I know studies about racial discrimination in the workplace use names – this one, for instance – but I have no idea about pre-tests in this area."

In Study 3, for instance, the authors find that conservatives ""were more likely to endorse consequentialist military action when the victims were Iraqi than when the victims were American."" I'd expect your ""welfare queens"" thought experiment to play out similarly.   But it is still worth considering whether the more liberal participants' increased likelihood of killing Chip is racially charged. As you say, maybe Chip is sacrificed more often for presumed economic or political reasons, but race is at least a plausible explanation.  I can't imagine the Uhlmann paper is the only work done on this topic. I'm hoping someone can point me to work that cancels out noise and makes clear whether- when posed with a trolley problem where sacrifices are of a particular race- liberal participants have a quick trigger finger towards whites."

So cutting spending will shrink GDP to match and you actually won't have any more money to pay your debt with.   So if he's looking at spending as a % of GDP, he winds up taking facts that support the anti-austerity narrative and seeing the opposite.  So Greece cut its spending, but its GDP shrank faster. That supports the anti-austerity point, but to him it means that Greece didn't undergo austerity at all (because spending as a % of GDP went up).  And Poland increased its spending steadily, and its GDP grew too. To him that means that Poland underwent austerity.

During the Citizens’ Platform (PO) first term they avoided significant spending cuts, and actually increased spending largely in preparation for the Euro2012 championships.   Starting earlier and including more of that time changes the overall picture. But around 2010 PO did begin to reduce spending. This is also shown in the data in the detraction article, with a sharp decrease relative to GDP both by percent and by total expenditures.   I think it might be disingenuous to include them as an example of ""austerity"" during that time frame, since they really didn't head far down that path until 2013, but they did reduce government spending for half the years he looked at, which fit the definitions Jeffrey Dorfman was using."

In absolute terms, Poland (which Dorfman extols as an austerity success) actually increased government spending between 2008 and 2012. It's just that Poland experienced overall economic growth during that time, so government expenditures as a percentage of GDP declined from 44.4% to 42.9%.

I won't go into detail here since this issue was recently and extensively covered by /r/badhistory, so I'll link you to the (fully sourced and detailed) debunking of this sort of sentiment right here. To summarize the post (and mods, please keep in mind that a more thorough and source explanation is found at the link), consider the following points:   the war was fought exclusively with the purpose of preserving slavery, as clearly laid out in the manifestos and other documents of the seceding states; the South had no special concern for states rights and had no problem attacking them when it was going against them, for example by demanding that the Federal government enforce the Fugitive Slave Act when certain Northern states annulled it in the decade before the war; nearly all of the unique traits of the South, culturally, economically, and politically, were ultimately rooted in the institution of slavery, and the seceding politicians realized themselves, as detailed in the documents cited in the linked thread, that this was the case. Essentially, everything that certain groups consider ""Southern heritage"" are inextricably and fundamentally connected to slavery.      As a personal aside, sorry that you were raised in an environment where the attitude you express is still accepted as true. There has been no cultural shift in my opinion, but recent events have made it clear to the nation that the most destructive parts of ""Southern heritage"" are still alive and well, and need to be actively suppressed. Most people simply feel that there is nothing to really be proud of in the Confederate legacy, and frankly, as a lifelong northerner myself, I am disappointed to see people still defending a society whose only and primary defining feature was the ownership of one human being by another. Don't take this as an attack on yourself, you can't help the environment you grew up in. But I hope you can understand the feelings of most of the nation on the topic of the South's legacy."

First, you leave out that the North and the South were vying for power within Congress because they had different priorities as their economic interests were different: the North was about pursuing manufacturing interests/trade/shipping; the south was about farming and related. As the western states expanded, and slave ownership gave such states more voting representation, there was a strong interest by the north in preventing southern states from expanding, and thereby causing the North to lose power.   Of course, there was anti-slavery sentiment that was purely anti-slavery sentiment, but my point is, it wasn't that simple. Even Lincoln at one point said it wasn't simply about freeing the slaves: On Aug. 22, 1862, President Lincoln wrote a letter to the New York Tribune that included the following passage: “If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do about slavery and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union.” http://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths-about-why-the-south-seceded/2011/01/03/ABHr6jD_story.html  Also, your blanket statement that everything that is culturally southern is about slavery is absurd. Example, per http://etd.library.vanderbilt.edu/available/etd-07242007-162825/unrestricted/final3.pdf: ""On the whole, respondents tend to talk a bout southernness as a culture, a way of life, rooted in a geographic place.  Perceptions of difference between southerners and folks from other regions involve a sense that southern people understand the culture in this region, such as southern patterns of speech, interaction, preferences in food and music, values such as the importance of family and religion, and so forth.  Being southern is not seen as something encoded in the genes of southerners.  Southerners, in other words, do not see themselves as differing from people of other regions in terms of such things as looks, hair color, skin tone, or any other physical features.  So being southern is perceived as a cultural designation, again based on place, rather than a biological designation.""  Where I do agree with you: Of course it mattered who won the war."

AskSocialScience,3c5q69,ThereIsReallyNoPun,6,Sun Jul 5 01:47:27 2015 UTC,"Question 1:  Here is some required reading on optimal taxation structures, it's more or less the industry standard.  Also, note that property taxes do create significant deadweight loss, land value taxes are a far more efficient form of taxation. I discuss the benefits of an LVT more thoroughly here. LVTs have no impact on per capita output or wages.  Income taxes as they are currently practiced certainly create deadweight loss. Here is an important paper that explores five revenue-neutral alternatives to the current structure. Using an OLG model (a standard macro workhorse), this paper arrives at a policy called the X-tax, which is in sum a progressive flat tax that subsidizes the poor. The only cohort it negatively impacts in equilibrium is the initial elderly, who are arguably the easiest cohort to help through transfer payments.  Corporate taxes are almost entirely borne by labor. Eliminating the corporate income tax would boost wages, output, and national savings.   Capital taxes are even more so borne by labor. Note this is also an endorsement of an LVT. Stiglitz figured out that the optimal capital taxation rate is zero in 1976.   Financial transactions taxes are tricky. Here is an economist article that explores the pros and cons (mostly cons). Bond trading fell 85% in Sweden after they passed an FTT. The biggest concern with FTT is it's impact on liquidity. An FTT would significantly diminish the role of high frequency trading, which has created liquidity for capital markets, and hasn't added substantive volatility to derivatives markets. Ultimately though, there are so many unknowns surrounding an FTT that there isn't really academic consensus about it.  Lastly, depending on its implementation a consumption tax can actually be one of the more efficient forms of taxation.   That's the academic consensus more or less. The model/theories/empirics are in the papers, though they'll probably require some degree of economic experience to fully grasp (not sure where you are in that regard).  Question 2:  Note that a consumption tax (or flat taxes generally) does not fit the formal definition of regressive taxation. Regressive taxation is a process wherein the average tax rate decreases as taxable income increases. A flat tax is neither progressive nor regressive, as the tax rate is constant at all income levels. However, it is fair to suggest that a purely flat tax could impose a greater overall tax burden on the poor (a different concept). This result would be subject to the distribution of income of each country. Note that the tax burden imposed can easily be ameliorated through transfer payments/a negative income tax. Also, the incidence of a flat tax on the poor can be reduced by  exempting some range of lower level incomes from taxation entirely."

AskSocialScience,3c3him,pier4r,9,Sat Jul 4 12:04:37 2015 UTC,"It's mostly true, and this fact is the basis of efficiency of the market, as the video claims. However, the video also betrays a completely naive knowledge of economics, and there are many, many caveats that should be taken into account before blatantly declaring that price is the be-all, end-all source of information.   When economists make models, especially simple ones like the basic model discussed in the video, they are created with the concept of ceterus paribus, or ""all else held equal"". Implicit in any form of model-making, especially in economics, is a simplification of the real-world scenario. To this end, economists make certain assumptions that may not always be true in the real world. This is not a problem per se, as long as everyone involved acknowledges the model's limitations, but when people spout introductory economic models as accurate representations of the world is where they cross a line.  The video in question relies on (at least) two especially problematic assumptions. Firstly, it assumes that all buyers and sellers have perfect information about their expected utility of the product in question, which is a point you bring up yourself. The unfortunate fact is that information is rarely perfect in the real world, even if it is an incredibly convenient simplifying assumption for economic modelling. This can result in people overvaluing or undervaluing products, reducing the efficiency of the market and skewing the price away from its ""true"" value.  The second assumption the video makes is that all costs and benefits of a product are incurred solely by the consumer. The theory goes that if this assumption is true, people will be able to weigh the costs and benefits and make a purchase decision based on their own preferences. Of course, this is not at all the case. In fact, nearly every product imaginable produces externalities when consumed, meaning that they have some sort of effect on a third party. The classic example of a negative externality is cigarettes: when smoked, they also cause third parties to incur costs through second-hand smoke and other effects. However, since these external costs are not carried by the cigarette consumer, the actual number of cigarettes smoked is higher than the socially optimal level. The theory goes that if the additional costs of healthcare and other damages were internalized into the price of the product (say, by taxing the cigarettes and using the revenue to combat the costs of smoking), a more socially optimal level of smoking could be achieved. Likewise, positive externalities can exist, the classic example being vaccinations: when you get vaccinated, you obviously benefit, but so does everybody around you to a small degree as a result of growing herd immunity. But since the additional benefit to others is not something an individual consumer takes into account, fewer people than socially optimal would be vaccinated. The point is that the price mechanism alone cannot communicate the true value of most products because it does not take into account the costs and benefits of consumption (or production for that matter, think pollution as a negative externality and job opportunities as a positive) to third parties. Those costs and benefits are externalized, and not part of the price.   There are other objections to the presented model as well, but those are the most glaring ones. To summarize (and as every Econ 101 teacher should emphasize): markets can work, and markets can fail; governments can work, and governments can fail."

AskSocialScience,3c3him,Dead_Glove,5,Sun Jul 5 12:41:18 2015 UTC,"Well, before I say much it is absolutely critical to make the distinction between the common usage of the word ""rational"" and how economists use it. When economists say that an economic actor is ""rational"", we mean that they are acting in accordance with their preferences, which means people try to maximize their own utility. Now, since there is no way to directly observe preferences, we can only determine them through behavior, making the statement ""economic actors are rational"" rather tautological: people act in accordance with their preferences, but we can only determine those preferences by observing their behavior, therefore their behavior is necessarily rational. As a result, there is really no ""rational"" and ""irrational"" in economics, everything is just by default rational. It doesn't really mean much, it's just a convenient label if nothing else.  That said, psychology does tell us that humans are extremely vulnerable to various psychological biases that can skew their perceived utility of a given action, thus keeping them from actually maximizing utility. You can see a large list of them here.   Of course, calling these purely a problem with free markets is not quite correct, since in any economic system you will have human decision makers of one sort or another that are vulnerable to these biases. Thus I would say that these biases are less an objection to free markets directly, but more of a general issue that needs to be taken into account in any economic system, including free markets."

AskSocialScience,3c3him,haalidoodi,2,Sat Jul 4 18:07:10 2015 UTC,"For the information they said that buyers have different information but that does not matter due to the information contained in the price itself   That's a fairly weak point on the part of MRUniversity, since for two reasons. Firstly, if you have an inaccurate view of how much utility you will get from a product, you're likely to buy too much or too little of it, reducing your own total utility in the process. Secondly, this model is relying a model of perfect competition, where there is one homogenous good being sold at the same price by producers too weak to affect market supply individually. Outside of perhaps the market for raw agricultural commodities, this is simply not the case in any industry in the world. And a producer will nearly always be more knowledgeable about the good they're producing than the consumer buying it, meaning that the producer can leverage this disparity in information to potentially overcharge for a good, assuming they have some small amount of monopoly power (meaning they have some control directly over the price of the product, as opposed to a perfectly competitive model, where all producers are ""price takers"" that have to accept the price set by supply and demand).   The problem many introductory economics videos and courses like this is that they fail to present the caveats, the exceptions, the weaknesses of the model--too frequently, they minimize or ignore the ceterus paribus part of the lesson. And that is absolutely critical, since while there's nothing wrong with learning raw, simplified concepts from which you can build up more complex models, you can't just accept the most basic models as accurate. One of the big drivers behind the rise of libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism especially in online communities is this rise of half-baked economic knowledge that has become so easily accessible to the public. I'm assuming you encountered these videos while taking the online course or at least trying to learn more about economics, for which I commend you. I just hope that you don't fall into the trap that so many others these days seem to do, in all social sciences. Whether it's the freshman psych student who start to diagnose all his friends, the polsci rookie who thinks she has thought up the perfect government or the econ beginner that becomes enthralled with the basic models, it's all too common these days."
AskSocialScience,3c3him,haalidoodi,2,Sat Jul 4 18:19:26 2015 UTC,"Yup thanks for the info. I guess that any introductory course that starts with oversimplified models to then refine them until the state of the art, should state this at the start. Could also be that the MRU stated this, i'm a bit jumping the playlist of the economic principles instead of following it straight.   One of the big drivers behind the rise of libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism especially in online communities is this rise of half-baked economic knowledge   (now i will start a huge digression) About this i think that if one has the possibilities (internet, communities where to ask when in doubt and so on, libraries, books, time ) nowadays he can learn the concepts (at least the basic ones, like a sort of bachelor's degree) of every field of knowledge, expect maybe some (i.e: medicine). Of course, either if you study in a institution or on your own, no one stops you to use 'broken' reasoning. Therefore if someone misses some information while consuming some knowledge online, without thinking on his own, there is no chance to read/listed a solid argument from that one. I still wonder why, i mean for me it is like that for certain discussions other principles kicks in that allow someone to say something that sounds absurd.  For example, i remember when i watched the zeitgeist video. The argument there (about money lent to a state, but with interest, from the state's central bank) seem reasonable and so one starts to have questions about the current system. Anyway exactly through those questions one gets more information and can realize that surpluses of the central bank of a state are just turned to the state. The problem appears (a lot of times) when someone, in my opinion, decided to question something after having consumed 'half-baked' knowledge and then stick to that knowledge because it is too hard for him to modify the point of view just established. Something on the line of self enhancement .  Of course the digression that i wrote is due to my perception, i do not know if i nail the real motivations or i'm totally delusional."

Here are some good articles.    Also, Thaler and Sunsteins' Nudge could be relevant.  Although it's not necessarily about persuasion, heuristics and choice architecture have been pretty influential, and Obama--along with several other leaders, like UK PM David Cameron--have set up ""Nudge Units."" For persuasion, the status quo bias can explain resistance to change, while heard mentality could explain shifting options.  Additionally, debate framing is important.  For example, the public's approval rating for ""Obama Care"" vs. ""The Affordable Care Act"" are not the same, with the latter more favorable--at least after initial passage, this may have changed after Obama began co-opting the former term.   I am not sure of literature on Nudges and persuasion, but try looking up ""heuristics/nudge for political  persuasion"" in Google Scholar.    Research by Neuman an MacKuen has implications for persuasion during political campaigns.  It's a fairly long, dense article, but a very interesting read.  If you want to change someone's mind, make them anxious.  When people feel worried or unsure, they try to rectify it by engaging in information-seeking behaviour; people are most likely to change their party affiliation or vote for another candidate when worried.  On the other hand, happiness or content can create complacency, in which someone can not really be convinced.  One more thing: in Motivated Reasoning, how much one sees the information-giver as credible and how much the individual trusts them is essential.  If they see them as untrustworthy or not credible, then the correction could backfire and harden the misconception.  Look into Opinion Leadership for research on political information diffusion among social networks and persuasion among friends, as well as the role of FOX and MSNBC pundits in political information processing and effectiveness.   Sorry for the wall of text, but TL; DR: political persuasion is really hard, and we're not sure if there is an effective way to do it.

AskSocialScience,3bzfsq,Meta-Cognition,6,Fri Jul 3 11:48:10 2015 UTC,"Krugman has the long post here (also posted elsewhere on the thread), but it only mentions Greenspan 7 times. It's not a real holistic view on his time. For a rebuttal to Krugman, see ""How Did Paul Krugman Get It So Wrong"", written by John Cochrane.  What I know about this issue is not an expert opinion, but I can point you in the direction of some. It seems Greenspan's actions and failures depend on who you ask. While Greenspan himself is obviously a biased actor, it's unlikely there are many unbiased ones. Ask Robert Reich, who was Bill Clinton's Labor Secretary, and he will likely tell you that Greenspan is Satan incarnate (see Reich's book Locked in the Cabinet). Ask Paul O'Neill, who was Secretary of the Treasury under George W. Bush, and he'll probably tell you he's a smart guy who perhaps made some mistakes, but he showers plenty of praise on him in his 2004 book The Price of Loyalty.  Greenspan himself has admitted fault over how he perceived the economy in the past, and perhaps his apology will explain more of why in his own words. But it wasn't a full apology, it was more admission of a mistake. There has been a debate at random times calling for Greenspan to apologize, while others claim he owes no one anything.  This may not answer your question directly: that's unlikely since you probably know more about econ than I do. But the sources I provided might be of interest in knowing where to look for other expert opinions. I hope that's useful, but if not I understand!"
AskSocialScience,3bzfsq,tayaravaknin,5,Fri Jul 3 22:51:57 2015 UTC,"Just to prefix while many of my priors align with Greenspan and I think he did a very good job prior to ~2000 (do you remember the '96 recession?) his tenure after this period was a disaster, while he certainly doesn't have responsibility for the recession itself he did make some extremely poor decisions.   for encouraging the use of ARMs   ARMs themselves are fine, the issue was anyone on an interest only ARM likely didn't have the income to support owning a home anyway so as soon as rates increased they could no longer make payments. As long as you can afford the higher payments when rates are high then an ARM will usually be cheaper then a fixed rate.   keeping interest rates too low from 2002-04.   2004-2007 is usually the range given, largely due to this.   interest rates from 02-04 helped put nGDP back on a ~5pc trend-line.   One of the reasons why we have FOMC instead of a computer is because rates need to be the product of a thoughtful exercise considering all data rather then isolated data points. This is what the PCE index looked like and this is what federal funds looked like, most of the PCE slowdown 01-02 was reduced spending on durables rather then an actual change in price levels (they also switched from CPI to PCE just before the recession which likely exaggerated the response) and even without that simply didn't justify crashing rates like that; the response to the recession needs to be proportional to the event which in this case was a super mild barely recession which certainly justified a reduction in rates but not a crash from 6 to 1.  Dropping to 1 largely tied their hands with what occurred afterwards, significant increases quickly cause problems all on their own so they couldn't increase rates fast enough after 2002 to deal with the bubble.  Greenspan had completely lost confidence in the ability of monetary policy to deal with bubbles after he deflated one equities bubble in '96 another one simply sprung up to replace it when rates came down, after '01 he just wanted perpetually low rates as he didn't consider the efficacy of monetary policy for deflating price bubbles to be sufficiently high to justify cooling off growth with aggressive monetary policy.  Also worth noting that an income target would have looked very different in terms of what was executed, the 4.5% target would have suggested an effective rate of around 11% in 2000 and 4% in 2002.   So first of all, how much of a role did the housing bubble play in the Recession?   It triggered failure of existing structural problems, the problems were relatively well known (in failure mode rather then scale) but it wasn't clear exactly when we would see the failures; we came close in 91. One of the big issues (and something that dictated fed response) is that because housing prices had never fallen everywhere at the same time the fed didn't consider it likely they would (both Greenspan & Bernanke stated this prior to the failure); clearly a vision failure as there was no mechanism that would actually prevent this from occurring, that it had not was illusory.  I think decades of poor regulation, the relative weakness of US banks due to prior separation of roles, mark-to-market rules and that the MBS system existed at all are more to blame for the recession itself.  One possible positive to come out of it is that the recession (and in Europe the subsequent sovereign debt crisis) have shaken out a large number of long standing structural problems, resulted in many improvements (capital requirements are finally headed in the right direction) and I would strongly suspect in the next several decades we will have far fewer problems then we would have had absent the last recession as it forced us to resolve these problems.   Second of all, how much responsibility does Greenspan have in creating that bubble?   While certainly not total (federal housing policy is largely responsible for it forming) they made it worse then it would have otherwise been and certainly didn't do enough to cool it down. What occurred 04-07 is a very good argument for why you should accept higher unemployment for the sake of economic management."

Mandarin is the most commonly spoken variant in China itself, while Cantonese is extremely common in overseas Chinese communities; they are mutually unintelligible. Both Mandarin and Cantonese are considered among the most difficult languages in the world to learn for English-speakers, so it would be a huge effort for all the people who have English competency to switch over to Chinese.   As a test case, you could look at the various countries in Africa such as Zambia, Ghana and Uganda, where Chinese investment and economic activity are ramping up,  and where people may speak both English and a local language, and see what language is being used to communicate between Chinese immigrants/contractors and locals.

Looking at top 10 (U.S., China, India, Japan, Germany, Brazil, UK, France, Canada, Russia): 3 nations speak English as an primary (and official) language. In Germany 56% of citizens speak English and France has 36%. Due to India's history of British Colonialism, English is commonly taught and spoken there (technically one of there official languages).

At the current level of its popularity, it is almost assured, it would be a huge surprise if something would break it.  For example, what can break networks effects is when high-status people abandon it and thus it becomes ""uncool"". Currently I can hardly imagine any serious group of high-status people who would prefer a different lingua franca.  Another thing could be cultural barriers.

Hell, I'd pay to review the paper. But don't look at me, I'm a theoretical psychologist. I'm probably biased in the whole ""useless skill"" field.   My point would be this:  1) It would be extremely, extremely biased. You state it yourself in your question (""Someone might say""). Exactly. Someone might say double dick dude has twice the skill in bed as the normal guy. Some may say he has half because he has to manage two dicks at once, and has to split attention.  2) A fallacy I think is so prevalent in this sub, and I wish we had a bot to just post it, is that almost every question fails to account for cultural biases, and yours is no exception. Under what culture are we evaluating those skills? Take, for instance, the skill of firing a bow. Useless in most modern, Westernalized countries (yet, why do we still have bow competitions, archery in the Olympics?) but probably extremely useful in a native group. I mean, if you think about it, your question itself shows your cultural lens - your example is DotA2. How many Indian children even have the ability to play DotA2? How can we state ""Americans are better at DotA2 than people from India"" when so little of the population is able to play it?  3) But hey, if I can't convince you it's a mundane question, I'd imagine your best bet to uncover this would involve first needing to define what the skill produces. AKA I'm not going to judge baking skills with chess skills. I think economists would like to file it under ""How much utility (again, needing to define utility, but let's go with 'good', where 'good' is a variable where we'll call it wealth, ignoring now that we're (a) not studying 'good' or 'utility' anymore, but really utility to the third root (b) saying that all wealth is good (c) that wealth has diminishing marginal utility (d) that everyone seeks more good and wealth (e) that wealth and money is not simply a social construct and (f) that there is indeed a truth out there we can seek and find and predict ) and then compare the amount of wealth each industry produces. Of course, what you'll find is that lawyers & doctors have the most ""skill"".   Now, the next question would be from that - well, is skill all that we need in the world? I guess we don't need teachers anymore, because their relative skill is low. And don't even get me started on kids before the age of 16! Their skill is about zero, minus those girls in the Girl Scouts.   Maybe we can compare skill relatively, not globally. Your example was indeed Dota vs LoL, or Bio & Music vs Bio. Again, we'd probably want to assume skill = wealth. Maybe this isn't so bad if we want to take a stab at the answer. If there's more wealth coming into the industry (or person), then their service is more valued. Also, the better they are at it (the more skill they have), the more they get paid. Again though, we run into a problem -- Was A-Rod, in his prime with the big Yankees contract, more skilled than Tuukka Rask (Bruins fan here, fuck the Yankees, cept you Jeter). Tuukka gets 7 million dollars a year while A Rod was pulling in $28 million dollars a year. Now, is this a cultural reason, where baseball is simply more popular? Do we really want to make the case that popularity = skill? Me as the nerd in high school vs the popular kids would like to say no. If we do say yes, how do we scale the 'skill' of an individual based on pay? Is A-Rod really 4 times as skilled as Tuukka? I'd love to shoot 100 mph pucks at A-Rod and see how long he lasts. Maybe it's logarithmic, and because they're so high the skill is relatively equal. Perhaps, but again, I'd point to where that leaves (a) teachers and other low paying professions (b) survivor bias in that we wouldn't be catching any of the extremely skilled, just currently out of world professionals, and children (and child prodigies).  4) I think that's a lot where stats comes in and where people are paid to argue about it. If you compare the clicks per minute of both Dota2 and an LoL player, keeping their location relatively similar as well as their role (carry, support, etc), maybe check their sponsorship payments, then you can argue who gets the better end of the deal and who is better. Similar with same sports, corsi and adjusted corsi and some even crazier stats I don't understand take place in hockey to deal with these things. But then we've even faced an issue not even stats can solve -- history. Wayne Grestky was the GOAT (I ain't going to insult the man) but can we really compare him to Sidney Crosby? The style of play between them is so much different. Rules changed. Goalies changed. Paddings changed. Goalie net size changed. Technology improved. It's impossible to tell by comparing stats because scoring has taken such a turn downwards. He'll never be touched because we've erased that from happening again through development.  Tl;dr: Statistics or economics. Maybe even neuroscience if someone wants to argue that coin. IMO it's all a waste of time ;)."
AskSocialScience,3btbyz,skyclerk,12,Wed Jul 1 23:51:09 2015 UTC,"I'll explain from the beginning since I'm going over my old textbook and relearning it a bit for myself. A sign denotes the relationship between a signifier and a signified, the signifier is just an image, word or sound and the signified is the meaning that it carries. A lot of what is signified is culturally based, for example this image of Einstein  to many is symbolic of intelligence. In this case we have signifier (Einstein) and signified (intelligence) combined to create the sign (association between Einstein and intelligence).   We had that for a while and it was kind of weird and didn't make much sense until Peirce came around and decided that instead the sign must be distinguished from the signifier not only by the meaning but by the object itself. As in what is the difference between what we see in an object and what the object actually is. For example if we think of the word 'cat' the signifier is the word and the signified is a real life cat and the sign is the connection between the word 'cat' and an actual cat. But this is wholly arbitrary, there's no reason why the signified (a cat) couldn't have any number of signifiers, it could just as easily be called a dog because the word has no relation to the real world object. This is what Peirce would call an arbitrary sign, it is a sign where there is no real world relationship between the signifier and the signified.   An iconic sign is the opposite of an arbitrary sign, it is a sign where there is a resemblance between the signifier and signified. For example, a picture of a cat and the idea of a real world cat both resemble each other more than the idea of a cat and the word cat. If you conditioned someone to see a picture of a dog and think of a cat then that would be an arbitrary sign.   Indexical signs are a little trickier but it basically means a sign with a signifier that has a relationship in time or place with its signified. For example if I leave a footprint in the snow the signifier would be the print and the signified would be myself; the footprint says that I had been there at some point therefore there is a relationship of signifier and signified based on time and place. All photographs are indexical signs and are almost all iconic signs as well. These categories aren't exclusive obviously.  I hope that has helped explain it to some extent. I'm quite exhausted and honestly get confused with it myself so I apologize if what I wrote is just nonsense.   Edit: My source for this was all my old university textbook:   Marita Sturken and Lisa Carthwright , Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture , 2 edn (Oxford: Oxford University Press , 2009), p. 28-32."

They don't know what they feel, they usually base their information on the latest information they have, and so on.  We know these people exist. We know they don't usually follow the news, but they are aware of what the latest thing is. They're the reason why, within a few weeks of invading Afghanistan, people knew plenty more about it than they do today. They're the reason why, when we ask in polls if people know who the Speaker of the House is, they know the answer when they hear about it in the news.  So these people are common, and many exist. In The American Voter Revisited, only an estimated 20% of people are ideologically motivated in their beliefs, and those are the most politically active. Others believe things based on the groups they're a part of, perhaps up to 30% (for example, voting according to cues by leaders like African-American civic leaders, church leaders, etc.). Another 28-30% probably vote on the basis of the ""nature of the times"", how they feel about their situations now. And the rest don't vote on the issues: they vote based on a variety of other factors.  This is one model, but it explains in a way how things might work. You call around, some good news recently came out, approval ratings go up. That's how approval ratings can change on the not-politically-engaged.  If you ask random people, the type who aren't political, typically aren't educated, and don't watch the news, what they think, they'll probably change their opinion a whole bunch based on what they just learned. But these people are also the least likely to vote, so there's always that in case you're wondering how they affect voting patterns. That's another issue entirely.  On issues like gay marriage, you get the idea. There's generational changes, understanding/exposure changes, and more.  Let me know if you have more questions. But try to think of it more broadly: there are people outside of cities, who hardly see anything in the news. They may not know much, they probably say if they approve based on whether their salaries just went up or down, or they say what they think based on how they feel about a recent thing in the news, etc.."

This is TB incidence;   US - 3 UK - 13 Norway - 8 Finland - 6 Canada - 5   The US is the only country which actively screens for TB as part of the immigration process and generally prevents immigrants with TB from moving though.  For some diseases there are non-healthcare modifiers, HIV incidence in developed countries has no relationship with the quality of healthcare delivery but rather how common contraceptive use is, the incidence of at-risk populations etc.   US - 0.6 UK - 0.3 Norway - 0.1 Finland - 0.1 Canada - 0.3   No strong data exists for ARV coverage in the developed world as all countries are generally considered to have effective universal coverage, the US has 89% coverage with the remainder non-compliance and un-diagnosed cases. Its worth noting that most HIV treatment in the US is public, even when an individual has private coverage its likely that they are receiving ARV treatment via one of the federal programs.  Influenza is another interesting case, the US is the only country which offers influenza vaccines to its entire population, is responsible for developing the vaccines used worldwide and has the lowest developed world mortality rate. Does this represent a better healthcare system or simply a different choice in where to use healthcare resources?  On the above its also worth noting that vaccine development in general the US leads the pack (87% of total worldwide public vaccine spending is in the US) and we also manufacture the ARV's used in the developing world; does comparing how countries organize their healthcare systems make sense when this kind of spending will always be public?"

In addition, it tends to have a mildly Carlyle-like ""great man"" view of history, focusing much of its wordcount on the actions of presidents and a few generals. In the civil war discussion, actions taken by the United States military or federal government may be unilaterally attributed to Abraham Lincoln, while anything done by any Confederate is associated with Jefferson Davis. The book also includes a good amount of personal details and anecdotes about the Presidents and their families (such as Rachel Jackson's first marriage or Aaron Burr's wild attempt to conquer Mexico) that are very engaging but not necessarily relevant to an overall understanding of American history.

As long as it is not too one sided everyone is happy to call it even.

I think what I was getting at was that a criticism of Jethrogalloch's point of view with a 'that's not what Durkheim would have said' doesn't really advance the argument very far, so I thought I'd counter it with a selective quote from Marx. I apologise for being flippant.  I haven't read the The Elementary Forms,  but it's interesting that you choose Australian aborigines because their culture (sorry to use that word, which I interpret as meaning ""a way of life"") didn't alter much for tens of thousands of years  prior to Western settlers coming to Australia.

Unless you're using a completely vertical AS curve (which is rejected by most economists except sometimes in the very long run), a fall in AD is all that's needed for the economy to suffer. Though AS may still fall in the face of capital flight (which we're already seeing at massive levels), emigration, or simply a radical restructuring of the economy which renders lots of factors of production useless.

If they were to start printing tons of money (as they'll have to do for the government to achieve its goals of export devaluation and lavish social spending), then this additional factor would have to be added into the model. Thus, even if the model suggests that the price level and GDP would fall simultaneously, printing money may counteract the former (how much depends on the level of printing and the velocity of the printed money, of course).   Though another interesting idea to cover is that quite a few banks could go under in the next few weeks as their support from the EU is cut off, which would severely damage the money supply and, my gut tells me, probably really impact velocity as well.

There are several reasons why the deficit reduction was viewed as an important economic consideration,firstly another recession will strike one day. Going in to a new recession with debt still high – and it’s higher now than at any time since the late 1960s could leave less room for manoeuvre. The other far bigger reason is that of future economic growth and national debt, the UK has an ageing population that will start hitting budgets hard from about 2027 making a balanced budget ever more difficult. ""10 million people in the UK are over 65 years old.  The latest projections are for 5½ million more elderly people in 20 years time and the number will have nearly doubled to around 19 million by 2050"". This important as even if we assume an average of 2% growth for the next 20 years and a balanced budget (unlikely with the strain of an aging population) , debt will still be above 50% of GDP by 2035. Above the 40% target set by the previous Labour government.  Not implementing budgetary constraints assumes that economic growth will be sufficient to rebalance the budget and reduce the debt load.

In fact this is the issue with the euro - the lack of an independent monetary authority for each fiscal regime amplified austerity, rather than assuaging it.

AskSocialScience,3bet7d,wordboyhere,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:19:51 2015 UTC,"Check my linked article a bit farther down by Krugman:   The key point to understand about fiscal policy under Cameron and Osborne is that British austerity, while very real and quite severe, was mostly imposed during the coalition’s first two years in power. Chart 3 shows estimates of our old friend the cyclically adjusted primary balance since 2009. I’ve included three sources – the IMF, the OECD, and Britain’s own Office of Budget Responsibility – just in case someone wants to argue that any one of these sources is biased. In fact, every one tells the same story: big spending cuts and a large tax rise between 2009 and 2011, not much change thereafter.  Given the fact that the coalition essentially stopped imposing new austerity measures after its first two years, there’s nothing at all surprising about seeing a revival of economic growth in 2013.  Look back at Chart 2, and specifically at what happened to countries that did little if any fiscal tightening. For the most part, their economies grew at between 2 and 4%. Well, Britain did almost no fiscal tightening in 2014, and grew 2.9%. In other words, it performed pretty much exactly as you should have expected. And the growth of recent years does nothing to change the fact that Britain paid a high price for the austerity of 2010-2012.  British economists have no doubt about the economic damage wrought by austerity. The Centre for Macroeconomics in London regularly surveys a panel of leading UK economists on a variety of questions. When it asked whether the coalition’s policies had promoted growth and employment, those disagreeing outnumbered those agreeing four to one. This isn’t quite the level of unanimity on fiscal policy one finds in the US, where a similar survey of economists found only 2% disagreed with the proposition that the Obama stimulus led to higher output and employment than would have prevailed otherwise, but it’s still an overwhelming consensus.

For the UK this meant most obviously absorbing the bad debts of banks to the tune of nearly 100 billion.

AskSocialScience,3bet7d,TheMania,6,Mon Jun 29 04:02:51 2015 UTC,"Have you read Bernanke's blog on this?   If you asked the person in the street, “Why are interest rates so low?”, he or she would likely answer that the Fed is keeping them low. That’s true only in a very narrow sense. The Fed does, of course, set the benchmark nominal short-term interest rate. The Fed’s policies are also the primary determinant of inflation and inflation expectations over the longer term, and inflation trends affect interest rates, as the figure above shows. But what matters most for the economy is the real, or inflation-adjusted, interest rate (the market, or nominal, interest rate minus the inflation rate). The real interest rate is most relevant for capital investment decisions, for example. The Fed’s ability to affect real rates of return, especially longer-term real rates, is transitory and limited. Except in the short run, real interest rates are determined by a wide range of economic factors, including prospects for economic growth—not by the Fed.  To understand why this is so, it helps to introduce the concept of the equilibrium real interest rate (sometimes called the Wicksellian interest rate, after the late-nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Swedish economist Knut Wicksell). The equilibrium interest rate is the real interest rate consistent with full employment of labor and capital resources, perhaps after some period of adjustment. Many factors affect the equilibrium rate, which can and does change over time. In a rapidly growing, dynamic economy, we would expect the equilibrium interest rate to be high, all else equal, reflecting the high prospective return on capital investments. In a slowly growing or recessionary economy, the equilibrium real rate is likely to be low, since investment opportunities are limited and relatively unprofitable. Government spending and taxation policies also affect the equilibrium real rate: Large deficits will tend to increase the equilibrium real rate (again, all else equal), because government borrowing diverts savings away from private investment.  If the Fed wants to see full employment of capital and labor resources (which, of course, it does), then its task amounts to using its influence over market interest rates to push those rates toward levels consistent with the equilibrium rate, or—more realistically—its best estimate of the equilibrium rate, which is not directly observable. If the Fed were to try to keep market rates persistently too high, relative to the equilibrium rate, the economy would slow (perhaps falling into recession), because capital investments (and other long-lived purchases, like consumer durables) are unattractive when the cost of borrowing set by the Fed exceeds the potential return on those investments. Similarly, if the Fed were to push market rates too low, below the levels consistent with the equilibrium rate, the economy would eventually overheat, leading to inflation—also an unsustainable and undesirable situation. The bottom line is that the state of the economy, not the Fed, ultimately determines the real rate of return attainable by savers and investors. The Fed influences market rates but not in an unconstrained way; if it seeks a healthy economy, then it must try to push market rates toward levels consistent with the underlying equilibrium rate."
AskSocialScience,3bet7d,usrname42,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:14:58 2015 UTC,"You're going to laugh at this statement, but Krugman has a pretty poor understanding of money, banking and interest rates on general. Take this for instance:   Large deficits will tend to increase the equilibrium real rate (again, all else equal), because government borrowing diverts savings away from private investment.   He's actually an adherent to the limited loanable funds model, where savings (from somewhere) are consumed when someone borrows. Eg when you go take out a car loan, interest rates rise imperceptibly such that someone else now can't. It's all utter nonsense in the context of a modern monetary system where loans create deposits, but Krugman's yet to catch up. He's bordering on it in places (for instance when he discovers in this piece that bond vigilantes are expansionary when attacking free floating currency issuers), but he refuses to quite let go of the old, dangerous, knowledge.  Give it time. In the meantime I recommend reading this piece referring the BoE piece that firmly discredits limited loanable funds and its assertion that ""higher deficits = higher rates"".. or again, just look at Japan.

AskSocialScience,3bet7d,TheMania,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:06:55 2015 UTC,"Surely Bernanke's (not Krugman) argument doesn't need to rely on loanable funds? If the government borrows more, spending without taxing the same amount, that will increase aggregate demand. If the economy was previously at full employment, then the central bank has to reduce aggregate demand to compensate in order to meet its price stability objective. It does this by raising interest rates. (I believe MMTers don't always agree that the central bank changing increase rates affects demand, but the BoE paper you linked to seems to.) There's no loanable funds element there, but higher deficits still lead to higher interest rates as if loanable funds were literally true - in which case loanable funds is not necessarily a bad way to think about it. If the central bank were perfectly able to set interest rates, the only reason the economy wouldn't be at full employment would be if it was unable to set rates to equal the rate that maintains full employment and price stability because of the zero lower bound. In that case higher government borrowing would not increase interest rates. But that's only true in a liquidity trap, not in normal times."
AskSocialScience,3bet7d,usrname42,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:20:27 2015 UTC,"If the government borrows more, spending without taxing the same amount, that will increase aggregate demand.   The government has many ways of affecting these factors irrespective of its deficit spend. Eg, consider that taxing money lost under couches would have minimal effect on demand (or similarly mining landfills for lost money, even if profitable). Taxing money held by the rich would have more, but still not a lot. Taxing the poor of their disposable income would have a fairly maximal effect.  Similarly, not all spending is equal. Speeding to buy up resources the private sector has left idle (eg through a job guarantee) would have less of an impact on prices than openly competing with the private sector to buy resources to build a new sports stadium. Etc.  It's easy to see that even without altering taxation or spending the govt could affect aggregate demand (and more easily aggregate supply) through regulatory changes alone.  So no. You can't conclude that a higher deficit = higher rates, even with a fully employed economy and an inflation targeting central bank... which brings me to my second point:   If the economy was previously at full employment,   Is a ridiculously huge if. Post WW2, full employment meant <2% unable to find jobs and long term unemployed meant 6 weeks. These days you can pretty much multiply those numbers by three and politicians would think they're doing a pretty decent job, and even go so far as to run contractionary policy to ""save money"". We've moved from fiscal policy to manage unemployment to rate-setting, and frankly it's just too blunt a tool to do a good job.  in any case, today with rates at 0% (and have been for a long time) it's obvious that even the CB's that be think that we need more AD today, not less.   If the central bank were perfectly able to set interest rates, the only reason the economy wouldn't be at full employment   You surely don't think that there's one global rate suitable for all parts of the US? That a Fed acting solely in New York's interests would choose the same rate as one acting for Detroit?  No. The single interest rate set by the Fed is always a compromise of many conflicting interests. It's a blunt tool, incapable of keeping the economy fully employed on its own."

(It's award winning and published by one of the best publishers for the social sciences).  Here is the abstract:   Why do people smoke? Taking a unique approach to this question, Jason Hughes moves beyond the usual focus on biological addiction to demonstrate how sociocultural and personal understandings of smoking crucially affect the way people experience it. Hughes begins by tracing the transformations of tobacco and its use over time, from its role as a hallucinogen in Native American shamanistic ritual to its use as a prophylactic against the plague and a cure for cancer by early Europeans, and finally to the current view of smoking as a global pandemic. He then analyzes tobacco from the perspective of the individual user, exploring how its consumption relates to issues of identity and life changes. Comparing sociocultural and personal experiences, Hughes ultimately asks what the patterns of tobacco use mean for the clinical treatment of smokers and for public policy on smoking. Pointing the way, then, to a more learned and sophisticated understanding of tobacco use, this study should prove to be valuable reading for anyone interested in the history of smoking and the sociology of addiction.

Nicotine increases working memory, generally improving performance on cognitive measures.  In any case, people do make logical and rational choices regarding smoking.  People quit in response to permanent tax increases on cigarettes but do not quit when cigarettes become temporarily more expensive (such as when vacationing in a high tax state).  This means smokers are weighing long-term costs and benefits when making the decision to quit.  How is this not rational?   ""Because their biological processes affect what they're thinking and physically cause them to want to smoke.""  Anything a person does is done through biological mechanisms.  People buy consumption goods, eat food, listen to music, have sex, and socialize because these things increase dopamine in the nucleus accumbens.

Yet, race identification continues to be one of the central foci of forensic anthropological casework and research. It is maintained in this paper that the successful assignment of race to a skeletal specimen is not a vindication of the race concept, but rather a prediction that an individual, while alive was assigned to a particular socially constructed 'racial' category.

Since the spread simple aggregates the total populations in the South and non-South, this is fairly easy to do. If you want to move a state from South to non-South (for example Delaware, which for some reason is considered part of Dixie by the Census Bureau?), then simply set its population to 0 and add its original population to that of a non-South state.

But it turned out that the same personality traits correlated with some unexpected other features. Shy adolescents were more likely to be blue-eyed (all the subjects were of European descent), susceptible  to allergies, tall and thin, narrow-faced, to have more heat-generating activity under the right forehead and a faster heartbeat, than the less shy individuals. All of these features are under the control of a particular set of cells in the embryo called the neural crest, from which a particular part of the brain, the amygdala, derives. They also all use the same neurotransmitter, called norepinephrine, a substance very like dopamine. All these features are also characteristic of northern Europeans, Nordic types for the most part. Kagan's argument goes that the Ice Age selected those better able to withstand cold in these parts: people with high metabolic rates. But a high metabolic rate is produced by an active norepinephrine system in the amygdala, and brings with it lots of different baggage - a phlegmatic and shy personality being one aspect and a pale appearance being another.

A group of friends or strangers is exactly such a social group, they have no definite shared concrete goal as i perceive, the talks they have,are not organized and structured, the games they play do not have end goals, so its hard to establish power-relations.

AskSocialScience,3b3oz4,smurfyjenkins,2,Thu Jun 25 20:02:50 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, it's fairly difficult to measure actual corruption because a large percentage of public corruption goes unreported and may never be brought to light.   In addition, other metrics like prosecution for corruption related offenses may be trumped up political charges with fabricated evidence, so they can be unreliable too.   As a result, a very popular measure is the perception of corruption. This is measured by polling, just like other issues, with the statistical modeling behind it.

AskSocialScience,3b0mpm,Justdowhatever93,77,Thu Jun 25 00:39:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's anyway to be 'objective' about an inherently subjective text. I just honestly don't see how that's possible.Even if an atheist sat down today and read it, that person would still be bringing in subjective bias.   Most serious modern political science arguments and investigations into violent religious extremism have very little to do with the literal text of the Quran and much more to do with the effects of resource deprivation, Western imperialism, identity politics, trends in governance structures, or some combination of those. See, for example, 'Cutting the Fuse' by Pape & Feldman which makes the case (largely successfully) that suicide terrorism really has nothing at all to do with religion as a causal factor and much more to do with conflicts by Western powers.  But if you really are interested in the concepts surrounding popular arguments people cite when making the case that Islam is inherently violent or peaceful, the fact still remains that they usually bring in cultural and contextual arguments to make the majority of their case.   A great and prominent example of this is Bernard Lewis in 'What Went Wrong?'. Basically, he argues there's inherent aspects of Middle Eastern and Islamic history and culture that predisposes Arabs to a resistance towards modernity and democracy, rendering them perpetually as ""poor, weak, ignorant"" and violent, uncivilized backwaters. He breaks down various aspects of interpretations of the Quran that are culturally popular, for example, and cites them as reasons why in his view middle easterners aren't predisposed to fight for freedom and have so many dictatorships (e.g., ""Holy Law lays out the role of the ruler and his relationship to believers (his subjects)"" )  And while many (including myself) would point out arguments like Lewis' are nonsensical and more than a little racist, and that they fail to account for so much that's known not just about the middle east, but human nature and political behavior as a whole, those arguments are the serious academic version of ""Islam is inherently violent"", which up until a time were very popular and very well reguarded. So much so that Bernard Lewis (along with his idiotic theory) was famously invited to the oval office to advise George W. Bush in the lead up to the Iraq War (and make the argument that military intervention is necessary in the Middle East because we have to ""bring them freedom or they destroy us"".)   But people can make any claim about a subjective text under the guise of objectivity, so answering your question literally would be a useless endeavor. For instance, apparently God killed 2.5 million people in the christian bible while satan killed only 10. That's an objective observation which objectively supports my belief that God, as portrayed in the bible, is inherently more violent than Satan."

Lewis has previously gone on record in his book Islam: The Religion and the People saying ""it is a pity"" that Islamic terrorists don't read their own religious texts. He said:   Muslim fighters are commanded not to kill women, children, or the aged unless they attack first; not to torture or otherwise ill-treat prisoners; to give fair warning of the opening of hostilities or their resumption after a truce; and to honor agreements...At no time did the classical jurists offer any approval or legitimacy to what we nowadays call terrorism. Nor indeed is there any evidence of the use of terrorism as it is practiced nowadays.   I don't know much about the rest of it, but it seems pretty clear he doesn't necessarily believe the problem is the Quran, but rather the way it's being interpreted improperly, a common critique of authoritarian regimes in the Middle East that have sought to subvert religion to their own benefit."
AskSocialScience,3b0mpm,tayaravaknin,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:15:43 2015 UTC,"In a nutshell, Lewis largely consistently makes the argument that a rejection of modernity (he associates modernity with Western values) has left the middle east a backwater, and this rejection is informed by, and in huge part a result of, Islam and the culture that surrounds it. He's a historian with a guise of objectivity, but largely an apologist for Western Imperialism (you can imagine why he was so popular in the lead up to the Iraq war).   ""There is no Cuba, no Vietnam, in the Muslim world, and no place where American forces are involved as combatants or even as ""advisers."" But there is... a surge of hatred that distresses, alarms, and above all baffles Americans. At times this hatred goes beyond hostility to specific interests or actions or policies or even countries and becomes a rejection of Western civilization as such, not only what it does but what it is, and the principles and values that it practices and professes. These are indeed seen as innately evil, and those who promote or accept them as the 'enemies of God.'"" -Lewis, '99  ""Islam is one of the world's great religions... But Islam, like other religions, has also known periods when it inspired in some of its followers a mood of hatred and violence. It is our misfortune that part, though by no means all or even most, of the Muslim world is now going through such a period, and that much, though again not all, of that hatred is directed against us."" -Lewis, 99  ""Arab ways are different from our ways... but it is possible for them--as for anyone else, anywhere in the world, with discreet help from outside and most specifically from the United States--to develop democratic institutions of a kind. This view is known as the ""imperialist"" view and has been vigorously denounced and condemned as such... [But] if one follows the discourse, one can see that the debate in this country since [the invasion of Iraq] has caused many of the perpetrators and sponsors [of terrorism] to return to their previous diagnosis [of a weak America]. Because remember, they have no experience, and therefore no understanding, of the free debate of an open society. What we see as free debate, they see as weakness, fear and division... There are, as I've tried to point out, elements in Islamic society which could well be conducive to democracy. And there are encouraging signs at the present moment--what happened in Iraq, for example... I think that the effort is difficult and the outcome uncertain, but I think the effort must be made. Either we bring them freedom, or they destroy us."" -Lewis, '06  [INTERVIEWER]: A lot of analysts, and this is especially something you hear from political leaders in the Muslim world, say that Islam has nothing to do with terrorismthat these are completely separate issues. Is that a view that you subscribe to? Some people say that terrorism is largely caused by occupation or a response to U.S. policy, not Islam. [LEWIS]: Well, I cant subscribe to it since the terrorists themselves claim to be acting in the name of Islam... When a large part of the Muslim world was under foreign rule, then you might say that terrorism was a result of imperialism, of imperial rule and occupation. But at the present time, almost the whole of the Muslim world has achieved its independence. They can no longer blame others for what goes wrong. They have to confront the realities of their own lives at home. - Lewis, '08"

You misunderstand Lewis' arguments and positions, and fail to accurately consider the context surrounding them.  Criticizing Bernard Lewis is not a knee-jerk reaction to him ""working"" in the Bush administration, it's a very clear response to his ideas ""largely form[ing] the intellectual foundations for the neoconservative view of the Muslim world,"" and in no uncertain terms advocating for the literal invasion of countries simply because they are Islamic. Or in the case of Iraq, advocating for invasion because somehow a nation run by a Secular regime--by the way, previously supported by a 'Judeo-Christian' Western nation--required military intervention to counteract some authoritarianism inherent to Islam.  Equating Lewis' policy with that of the Bush Administration is not ""more ad hominem than actual attack on his beliefs."" An attack on the Bush Doctrine is very much an attack on Lewis' (incorrect) theories.   Lewis has had such a profound influence that according to the The Wall Street Journal, “the Lewis doctrine, in effect, had become US policy.” If that policy has now been shown to be fundamentally flawed and based on a set of wholly erroneous assumptions, it follows that for all his scholarship, Lewis’s understanding of the subtleties of the contemporary Islamic world is, in some respects at least, dangerously defective. - The New York Review of Books, 2004  It seems to me at every point he says that Islam is being distorted here...democracy will allow the Arab people to flourish away from cultures that do not respect human rights.   No, he argues military intervention, and forced modernity (or at least, what he views as modernity) on the part of Western powers, will counteract a culture of oppression which has its origins in a religion that is encouraging violence.   The historian recited the modern failures of Arab and Muslim societies and argued that anti-Americanism stemmed from their own inadequacies, not America's... The Lewis Doctrine posits no...clash of interests or even ideology, but of cultures.   Lewis doesn't Islam is being 'distorted' by an authoritarian leader, per se, and that a peaceful regular joe follower of Islam is following a true Islam. He believes that religions have historical character, that they go through ebbs and follows of identity and interpretation, from which their followers are largely a slave to. He believes Islam to be in one such flow now, a flow towards hatred and violence of Western modernity when instead they have historically, in his view, been most successful when they showed more deference to Western civilization.   A central Lewis theme is that Muslims have had a chip on their shoulders since 1683, when the Ottomans failed for the second time to sack Christian Vienna. ""Islam has been on the defensive"" ever since, Mr. Lewis wrote...   For 300 years, Mr. Lewis says, Muslims have watched in horror and humiliation as the Christian civilizations of Europe and North America have overshadowed them militarily, economically and culturally. ""The question people are asking is why they hate us. That's the wrong question,"" said Mr. Lewis on C-SPAN shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks. ""In a sense, they've been hating us for centuries, and it's very natural that they should. You have this millennial rivalry between two world religions, and now, from their point of view, the wrong one seems to be winning."" He continued: ""More generally ... you can't be rich, strong, successful and loved, particularly by those who are not rich, not strong and not successful. So the hatred is something almost axiomatic. The question which we should be asking is why do they neither fear nor respect us?"" For Mr. Lewis and officials influenced by his thinking, instilling respect or at least fear through force is essential for America's security. - Wall Street Journal, 2004   For Lewis, the United States is a ""child of Europe"" and European values, beliefs, cultures, and religions are inherently superior to those of the middle east. It's not just our moral duty and obligation to bring those cultures to the middle east, it's a matter of our safety because otherwise their anger and jealousies will cause them to strike out at us. And afterwords? They'll largely thank us for bringing them 'freedom'. It's a cousin to arguments made in the 1800s in support of imperialism."

Right this is a book review and that's all well and good. But some quotes from his actual books to reinforce opinions of him are what I'm asking for. For example, you keep talking about him claiming that authoritarianism is ""inherent to Islam"", but the best argument for that is made by the book review you posted, which has a very politicized argument. The article it draws from actually uses the word ""Koran"" only 3 times, and twice it is doing so in comparison to the Old and New Testaments. He argues that classical Islam, the old interpretation that ignores the evolution of each school, is being returned to and fomenting the issue. He is not saying that Islam is the problem, only that a 7th century interpretation of it is inconsistent with modern values and thus leads to conflict. How the NY Times Review author missed that is beyond me, but it seems very politicized.   Equating Lewis' policy with that of the Bush Administration is not ""more ad hominem than actual attack on his beliefs."" An attack on the Bush Doctrine is very much an attack on Lewis' (incorrect) theories.   No, an attack on the Bush Doctrine is an attack on the Bush Doctrine. Lewis' beliefs on policy prescriptions are not his beliefs on the relevance of Islam and its interpretations today. One can believe that Islam is being perverted by Arab authoritarian regimes but not believe that it is necessary to interfere. His work on the interpretation of Islam is what you regard as racist, not his policy prescriptions that follow, and the policy prescriptions are just one way of taking the interpretive work. So discussing the interpretive work is necessary, not launching into ""He helped Bush!"" arguments.   No, he argues military intervention, and forced modernity (or at least, what he views as modernity) on the part of Western powers, will counteract a culture of oppression which has its origins in a religion that is encouraging violence.   Again, it seems you are missing the point he is actually making. Yes, he prefers military intervention. That's fine. But that's not racist. What would be racist is if he believed the religion was encouraging violence. Not only did I provide the quote showing that is not the case, and that he believes it is a perversion and return to 7th century Islam that is causing the violence/oppression, the article I mentioned earlier says:   In the classical Islamic view, to which many Muslims are beginning to return, the world and all mankind are divided into two: the House of Islam, where the Muslim law and faith prevail, and the rest, known as the House of Unbelief or the House of War, which it is the duty of Muslims ultimately to bring to Islam. But the greater part of the world is still outside Islam, and even inside the Islamic lands, according to the view of the Muslim radicals, the faith of Islam has been undermined and the law of Islam has been abrogated. The obligation of holy war therefore begins at home and continues abroad, against the same infidel enemy.   Here he clearly draws the line between those moving back to the classical and archaic interpretation of an Islam that is inconsistent with its evolution since the early days of it, and those who still pursue the Islam that is not based in this archaic interpretation of the world. Already he recognizes nuance that proves it is not ""inherent"" to Islam, but rather inherent to the classical interpretation that is anachronistic and unjustified by Islamic tradition. He goes on to say:   Like every other civilization known to human history, the Muslim world in its heyday saw itself as the center of truth and enlightenment, surrounded by infidel barbarians whom it would in due course enlighten and civilize.   So he already recognizes that this history is not unique to Islam, but is in fact apparent in every major religion that has had a heyday. Much of what he says follows from this: he describes the point of view of classical Islamists, not the view of the religion itself. This becomes clear as you read on:   But why the hostility in the first place? If we turn from the general to the specific, there is no lack of individual policies and actions, pursued and taken by individual Western governments, that have aroused the passionate anger of Middle Eastern and other Islamic peoples. Yet all too often, when these policies are abandoned and the problems resolved, there is only a local and temporary alleviation. The French have left Algeria, the British have left Egypt, the Western oil companies have left their oil wells, the westernizing Shah has left Iran—yet the generalized resentment of the fundamentalists and other extremists against the West and its friends remains and grows and is not appeased.   Note which people he is talking about. He is not talking about all of Islam being affected by imperialism, but rather the perverted and anachronistic views of Islam that are affected because of the lens through which they see the world. Moving on, he says:   This revulsion against America, more generally against the West, is by no means limited to the Muslim world; nor have Muslims, with the exception of the Iranian mullahs and their disciples elsewhere,    experienced and exhibited the more virulent forms of this feeling. The mood of disillusionment and hostility has affected many other parts of the world, and has even reached some elements in the United States. It is from these last, speaking for themselves and claiming to speak for the oppressed peoples of the Third World, that the most widely publicized explanations—and justifications—of this rejection of Western civilization and its values have of late been heard.   So again, just pushing out the fact that he is not saying this is unique to Islam. Quoting him some more:   The movement nowadays called fundamentalism is not the only Islamic tradition. There are others, more tolerant, more open, that helped to inspire the great achievements of Islamic civilization in the past, and we may hope that these other traditions will in time prevail. But before this issue is decided there will be a hard struggle, in which we of the West can do little or nothing. Even the attempt might do harm, for these are issues that Muslims must decide among themselves. And in the meantime we must take great care on all sides to avoid the danger of a new era of religious wars, arising from the exacerbation of differences and the revival of ancient prejudices.   Again, as you can see, he is not saying it is inherent to Islam.   Lewis doesn't Islam is being 'distorted' by an authoritarian leader, per se, and that a peaceful regular joe follower of Islam is following a true Islam. He believes that religions have historical character, that they go through ebbs and follows of identity and interpretation, from which their followers are largely a slave to. He believes Islam to be in one such flow now, a flow towards hatred and violence of Western modernity when instead they have historically, in his view, been most successful when they showed more deference to Western civilization.   He believes that the religious character is being distorted by the culture pushed on it by history itself. He notes:   There is something in the religious culture of Islam which inspired, in even the humblest peasant or peddler, a dignity and a courtesy toward others never exceeded and rarely equalled in other civilizations. And yet, in moments of upheaval and disruption, when the deeper passions are stirred, this dignity and courtesy toward others can give way to an explosive mixture of rage and hatred which impels even the government of an ancient and civilized country—even the spokesman of a great spiritual and ethical religion—to espouse kidnapping and assassination, and try to find, in the life of their Prophet, approval and indeed precedent for such actions.   Why? He goes further into it:   The instinct of the masses is not false in locating the ultimate source of these cataclysmic changes in the West and in attributing the disruption of their old way of life to the impact of Western domination, Western influence, or Western precept and example.   Imperialism, Western influence conflicting with a religion that has not yet gone through the throes of religious wars, this is what he talks about. He talks of the culture of Islam as a multifaceted thing, an entity composed of multiple viewpoints in conflict and looking towards the future to try and determine whether secularism or fundamentalism will succeed. He does not see Islam as monolithic, as you are pushing. He sees the US as an inheritor of European civilization, sees it as the new scapegoat for calls against imperialism, and sees it as not only not unique to Islam as a religion/group, but not applicable to all of Islam. That you are missing this nuance and misunderstanding what he means when he talks about the ""culture of Islam"" is the problem: he talks about it as a morphing thing made up of multiple facets, you see him as pretending Islam is a monolithic bloc that has some dissenters. He makes clear his distinctions between fundamentalism and secularism and compares them to the throes of other major religions. It is not racist, it is nuanced to look at Islam by its groupings (which are ideal types), rather than at it as a monolithic bloc, which is what you accuse him of."

Why does the core islamic world behave particularly differently from other imperially exploited communities in a post-colonial context?""   Alright, well I focused on suicide terrorism because it is obviously the most pertinent form of political violence in the middle east consistently linked to religious motivation--that's just the truth of our political and academic focus as a nation.   And most of the arguments you cited are generally used in serious scholarship as a support of some sort of Islamic tendency towards authoritarianism--not necessarily that the Quran is 'inherently violent'. Contrary to what some political scientists would probably like to admit, contemporary scholarship surrounding the middle east is largely devoted to answering two key questions: Why do suicide terrorists exist (/choose their targets); and why is the Middle East prone to authoritarian (and often violent) leadership? But generally the average person that's asking about some Islamic predisposition towards violence is typically far more interested in an answer that concentrates on the first question than the second.  Putting aside your extremely debatable conceit that much of East Asia and North Africa are indeed best thought of in a ""post-colonial context"" in anything but the most absolutely literal sense, most of your actual 'questions' (or just allusions to ideas with heavily right-wing conservative implications...?) are all generally just references to arguments made in support an unprovable concept. It's an idea that's been debated extensively: that oppression (and the violence that comes with it) is somehow promulgated by Islamic tradition. In it's most basic form all we end up with is 'muslims don't want/like/have freedom because they're muslim.'  The arguments you've stated are largely insufficient. They became most prominent around the time of the Iranian revolution (typically, conveniently exonerating Western influence and actions) and propose to explain the success of authoritarianism, but are then piss-poor at predicting when authoritarianism fails in the middle east. Generally even some of the most conservative modern critics, like Eva Bellin, cite some sort of Islamic culture that they believe to be ""inhospitable with democracy"" low on a list of factors that includes things like geography or lack of labor unions as more important factors. These arguments have fallen out of favor for a reason; They're unconvincing in support of a culture of authoritarianism, and even less convincing in support of conservatives' presupposition that Islam is violent compared to Christianity or Judaism (two religions which these critics are, of course, typically active participants in).

AskSocialScience,3avgg8,superkamiokande,25,Tue Jun 23 20:45:30 2015 UTC,"Your question isn't dumb, but it is a difficult one to answer. You would have to poll military members, control for ""adversity"", and then collect similar data from a non-military sample. How would you quantify adversity, though? Just service members that deploy? What about deployments for service members in non-combat roles? Or what about combat arms personnel that didn't deploy? What makes adversity faced in the military different than adversity faced by other groups (like medical professionals, police, maybe Wal-Mart greeter in a bad neighborhood...)?  Even if you saw that military members were less racist, it may not be a function of military service at all, but the recruitment pool as a whole - those over 42 cannot join, after all, and those joining at 18 can conceivably retire at 38. So you'd have to control for age, maybe gender, home of record... it'd be difficult to produce a high quality study on the subject.  All that said, James B. Stewart wrote an article that (partially) answers your question. His conclusion is that the military experience doesn't have a strong impact on racial identity.   The findings suggest that pre-military constructions of racial identity and patterns of racial interaction significantly constrain efforts to foster a primary identification with a homogenized military culture.   He suggests that the military is more a mirror of society at large rather than a separate environment functioning differently. This is despite the military's efforts to produce a unique culture and identity that will ostensibly replace the civilian one service members had when they joined.   Stewart, J. B. (2009). Be all that you can be?: Racial identity production in the US military. The Review of Black Political Economy, 36(1), 51-78.    From my own experience, I would agree with his findings. I think people were tolerant, but off duty people would often choose to spend time with people that were most like them. Self-segregation of sorts.

Abstract: Scholarship on racial attitudes has found that white veterans of World War II and the Korean War had more positive views of blacks than white civilians. However, more recent studies have argued that white veterans who have served in an all-volunteer force (AVF) now express more virulent views of blacks. Using data from the 2010-2012 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, we explore whether military service continues to predict positive racial attitudes. We find that white veterans express more negative views of blacks relative to white civilians and that white veterans in the AVF generation exhibit the most negative views of blacks. Taken together, we believe that our results suggest a reassessment of the role of contemporary military experiences in liberalizing white racial attitudes and offer support for the self-selection perspective."

Marx touches on a variety of topics within social science (beyond economics) and philosophy that there seems to be a secondary source for Marx dedicated to whatever specific thing you want to get out of him.

AskSocialScience,3awadt,MyShitsFuckedDown2,5,Wed Jun 24 05:47:57 2015 UTC,"firstly try and get the Penguin edition of Capital since it contains both a good lengthy introduction by Ernst Mandel, but more importantly is considerably longer and contains Marx's footnotes (which some versions don't) important to better understanding the text  secondly I would personally suggest, for introductions, the work by Michael Heinrich An Introduction to the three volumes of Karl Marx's Capital over the more famous introduction(s) to Capital by D. Harvey. Heinrich's version is both shorter, and overall presents a better explanation/analysis of Capital than Harvey (an extensive criticism of which can be found here for those who are interested). The downside is Heinrich's text is an introduction to all three volumes, and thus avoids the more complex logical analysis of Capital volume one. Nevertheless it's still the better, shorter, cheaper, introduction imo though it really depends what you want out of Marx. Harvey's lecture series on Capital (available on youtube) can be misleading and inverted from the perspective of those wishing to apply and develop the analysis and theory of Capital, yet also appear fresh and clear for those wanting a basic understanding of a complex topic, so it really depends what you want out of Capital (though I would still suggest Heinrich's book as the best overall introduction, Harvey's is good as a step-by-step companion with lots of detail even if it can lost in that detail sometimes).  thirdly, as others suggested take lots of notes, don't rush it, and be patient! the first half of volume one is especially dense and often frankly boring. Don't, as some (such as Althusser) suggest, skip this part, the explanations contained within are the vital building blocks of all subsequent volumes (which also become progressively more general and broad).   fourth, enjoy yourself. Don't expect to understand everything Marx is saying first time round. Many people I know have read the book over 5 times and each time find something different and new, that's why the book's so great. Also Marx is a highly readable writer not only in the strength of his ideas, but the breadth of knowledge he brings into Capital with many interesting commentaries and thoughts on all sorts of topic via all sorts of different sources."

Looks really promising.  Edit: Here's an elaborate ""review"" (PDF) by Christian Fuchs.  Edit2: Fuchs' criticism of Heinrich: From the review:   Heinrich is a representative of a school of Marxist thought known as the “New Reading of Marx”-School (Neue Marx-Lektüre) that was formed in Germany and is grounded in the works of Hans-Georg Backhaus (2011) and Helmut Reichelt (2001, 2008), who interpret Marx’s value-form analysis in a logical way, oppose a historical interpretation and have argued for a monetary value theory.   Heinrich (2012, 63) in his introductory book to Marx’s three volumes of Capital even claims that “Marx’s value theory is rather a monetary theory of value”. He thereby deceives the readers and wants to create the impression that a specific interpretation of Marx – the one advanced by Backhaus, Reichelt, Heinrich and their colleagues – is Marx’s original and own version of the labour theory of value and that other interpretations are mistaken.   The problem of this reading of Marx is that it implies that it splits off the entire concept of value from Marx and thereby assumes that no exploitation takes place if a commodity is not sold (Fuchs 2014a, chapter 2; Haug 2013). “Marx’s value form analytical theory of money is inverted into a money-theoretical (‘monetary’) theory of value” that is ahistorical (Haug 2013, 153)."

AskSocialScience,3aqqwc,TheDemon333,3,Mon Jun 22 19:14:27 2015 UTC,"Again, many theories, including the fact that countries with warm climates tend to rely on raw goods exports as a large part of their economy. Products like coffee have remained at a similar price for many decades while the prices of manufactured goods (more likely to be produced in nations that cannot grow agricultural products as easily) have generally kept pace with inflation rates and include significantly higher margins. This leads to lower incomes for individuals in warm countries, lower standards of living, and often dissatisfaction with existing governments which are seen as responsible for economic problems. Another facet of the issue is tied to the effectivenes of guerilla war tactics in tropical climates. In countries like Vietnam and Colombia, it is easy for rebel groups to hide from state forces or other guerilla groups. Instead of extended engagement, fighting takes the form of sporadic skirmishes and fighting is drawn out over the span of decades. Because civilians living in these rural zones do not feel that the state works with the interests of the people in mind, civilians do not denounce guerilla activity to the state and may even warn rebel groups of incoming state troops. Furthermore, the ability of these countries to grow illicit crops and maintain drug trafficking hidden in expansive forests leads to more tension between state and drug trafficking groups, or between state and guerilla groups which sometimes engage in drugtrafficking in order to fund their operations without relying on burglary. Guerilla groups with significant drug-related income are extremely competent and have sustained fighting for upwards of 40 years in many cases.

If you want the most precise and exact answer, without nuance, your best bet is generally right to the DSM.   Here, ripped straight from the DSM-V:   ""OCD is characterized by the presence of obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessions are recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced as intrusive and unwanted, whereas compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that an indi­vidual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.""    Often in OCD you can find a ""cognitive-based drive (e.g., irrational fear of contamination)"" pushing towards a behavior. You also get those counting compulsions (serious distress if I don't flick this lightswitch 88 times), etc. OCD is associated with triggers and huge amounts anxiety, and generally at least some basic level of awareness.  For OCPD, it's drastically different. There has to be an impairment of the personality (which is basically just defined kind of as sense of self and interpersonal relationships with others). It's like the difference between someone flipping a light switch and Dwight Schrute, is a way to describe it I guess.  Here from the DSM:   ""Typical features of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder are difficulties in estab­lishing and sustaining close relationships, associated with rigid perfectionism, inflexi­bility, and restricted emotional expression.""  ""Rigid insistence on everything being flawless, perfect, and without errors or faults, including one’s own and others’ performance; sacrificing of timeli­ness to ensure correctness in every detail; believing that there is only one right way to do things; difficulty changing ideas and/or viewpoint; preoccupation with details, organization, and order.""   It might be going into too much detail, but diagnostically for a personality disorder to be present there must be ""impairment in personality functioning"" (i.e., impairment in at least two of the following: identity, self-direction, empathy, or intimacy).  Hope that explains the semantics of it clearly enough!"

AskSocialScience,3alubx,notarealaccount002,126,Sun Jun 21 14:16:01 2015 UTC,"This book is a good introduction to that issue, albeit indirectly insofar as your specific question is concerned. Basically, the author's argument is an elaboration on Marx's theory of Commodity Fetish and, to a lesser degree, False Consciousness.   Anne Mcclintock (the author of Imperial Leather) makes the claim that when one social/political group dominates another, certain predictable relationships will emerge. She labels these ""Splitting"" and ""Doubling"". Splitting is dividing the marginalized group geographically, economically, or in some other externally expressed manner. So, for example - have you ever been in a situation in which you could only afford housing on one side of town, but could only find employment on the other side of town? In a situation such as this, you basically find yourself in a vicious cycle where you spend all the money you earn paying rent and paying for the gas to get to work, like a hamster in a wheel, you're getting no where. This would be an example of ""splitting"", as the owner social/political group has successfully 'split' you geographically and economically, thus sustaining your marginalized status.  ""Doubling"" is more subtle, and it is where the identity of the marginalized is internally split, and this split is typically expressed in love/hate dynamics. So, in the case presented in your question, white males fantasize about black men having sex with their wives because they've turned the object they 'hate' (the racially marginalized class) into a fetish object. You'll note the same thing whenever you see a hard-right wing politician or priest who has made a career of marginalizing gay men gets 'outed' as a gay man himself. Or, as another example, you can see that Red states, which are by and large opposed to gay rights, nevertheless download and watch more gay porn than any of the Blue states citation.   This behavior is the result of the complex 'fracturing' of the modern identity, as described in Marx and Mcclintock's work. It would take me a little while to think of how to explain this 'fractured' identity without writing a wall of text, so I'll just leave this response for now. If this comment generates any interest, I'll come back and try to elaborate on these ideas.   EDIT - thanks for the gold!"

It might just be the fetishisation of African 'hyper-masculinity' making them a stand in as the 'most male' ideal and Asian women taking up the 'most feminine' ideal for interracial porn in the other direction.  I don't necessarily agree that interracial porn with black men and asian women is a US specific fetish stemming from our history of oppression, rather is the stereotypes of what masculinity and femininity are and fitting in people that fit the extremes of those stereotypes.  Porn is really just exaggerated cartoonish sex with the biggest dicks and breasts, exaggerated cumshots and moans, and visually stimulating active positions so fitting in racial stereotypes is pretty universal.  Within the subgenre of cuckold porn the color contrast and selection of a 'bull', that is a hypermasculine male that is what the husband is not, to mate with or 'breed' the wife is enhanced by the white-black dynamic and stereotypes, but its not limited to US cuckold porn.

So, Ambedkar (and others) had to try and write the Constitution in such a way as to protect religious identity (to garner support from the population) while to address the social inequality resulting from religious world views (particularly the caste system).

In her book, Mcclintock also focuses largely on the diaries of two lovers during the late Victorian era.

AskSocialScience,3alubx,JaggedOne,10,Sun Jun 21 17:56:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think the socio-psychological trends that Mcclintock is pointing out were intended to demonstrate some deliberate attempts to marginalize certain populations, but rather I read her to be saying that when a population get marginalized (and, for Mcclintock, it will be marginalized for economic reasons, although those economic reasons are expressed in social identity), we can expect certain predictable outcomes, such as her theory of Splitting and Doubling. This is to say, when people are marginalized (deliberately), there will be certain social relations that will spring up between dominate and marginalized communities (not deliberate, but insightful). But that's my take, you should give the book a read and see what you think.   Mcclintock's real contribution (IMO) is in taking Marx's notion of Commodity Fetish to one of its logical conclusion by recognizing this dynamic should be expected to be expressed in sexual fetishism as well. Marx + Freud, if you will. Whereas Marx discussed the commoditification of identity in regards to how the oppressed can have their angst/alienation re-directed (and thus used against them, a la False Consciousness, a point I'll return to shortly), Mcclintock explores how this socio-psychological dynamic can 'fracture' the identity of the marginalized in such a way as to make it difficult for them to even imagine themselves outside the 'gaze' of the dominate communities perception of them. Frantz Fanon famously elaborated on this point in his book ""Black Skin, White Masks"" where he explores the modern black identity with this type of framework in mind.   The difference between Frantz and Mcclintock, however, is that Mcclintock looks not only at the marginalized populations, but at the dominate one as well. And this is where we find these interesting explanations of these love/hate relationships, or strange occasions of co-opting the marginalized identity, like what we see with Rachel Dolezal. Or even in the way Americans idolized, romanticize, or make a fetish out of Native American culture, while sitting idly will real living Native Americans are ignored and continually marginalized. I would even argue that you can see the same process at work with the American fascination with Zen Buddhism right after we nuked Japan in WWII. Or, as in the case of the post that started this conversation, white men masturbating to the sight of black men having sex with white women. It's important to recognize, however, that Mcclintock is describing social forces, not prescribing how to engage them. As such, all she's really doing is explaining the problem. It's up to us to figure out how to address it.  And, since we're here, let me return to the point I made about Marx and the Commodity Fetish/False Consciousness combo. So, Marx is going to argue that the emergence of an economy will be coupled with the division of labor. If we all hunt and gather, I have no need to trade (the better hunter has all the resources they need, and the inferior hunter has nothing of value to trade with), but, as soon as we begin to diversify our labor, we have cause to trade (you make hammers, I make nails, let's talk). This division of labor, however, also synthesizes identity with the labor (this is why your last name, if you're European at least, refers to the trade of your ancestors - ""Smith"" = Blacksmith, and so on). As society grows, the division of labor continues to splinter and hyper specialize, and thus so do the identities of the people that perform these labors. This fracturing of the labor force (we used to make whole things, but now you just make one part on an assembly line) mirrors the fracturing of identity, producing Alienation - handy and quick video making this point  This alienation, at its base, is a reaction to being exploited/oppressed/marginalized, but it can easily be redirected by pitting the marginalized against each other (think Tea Party vs Occupy Wall Street). As long as I can make a persuasive ""Us against Them"" speech, I can blind you to the fact that it is actually ""Us against Us"". Getting people to fight each other rather than work towards their mutual best interest is what Marx means by ""False Consciousness"". We see this today when poor Republicans vote passionately for tax cuts for the wealthy and things like that. This redirection of alienation is further enabled by the Commodity Fetish, as the marginalized community is controlled by the market, and thus they begin to confuse the value of utility with the value of exchange - hilarious Key and Peele video demonstrating this principle .   So, TL;DR - Marx argues that labor becomes identity, identity and labor get splintered via the market, and then resold to the marginalized who produced it in the first place. These identities presented via the market, however, are 're-branded' in such a way as to keep the lower classes fighting among themselves while the wealthy class not only enjoy their positions undisturbed, but profit off the process.   And, to answer your question TL;DR style - Mcclintock isn't arguing that the blending of sexual fetish and commodity fetish is part of a deliberate effort to marginalize people, it's just an interesting side effect of deliberately marginalizing people."

AskSocialScience,3alubx,shannondoah,2,Mon Jun 22 10:03:23 2015 UTC,"Sure. So, McClintock would argue (along Marxist lines) that Rachel Dolezal is confusing Black identity with a commodity, like, a thing. Let's say, for example, like a pair of jeans or something like that. Now, Rachel also feels great empathy for the plight of Black culture, but due to her own culturally defined ""Whiteness"", she is unable to express her empathy in any other way than to try and possess the commodity which she is drawn to. So, using an analogy, the only way she can articulate her empathy for Black culture is to 'wear' Black culture, like a pair of jeans. Identity, from this view, can only be understood as a commodity.   This takes us back to Marx's Commodity Fetish and the confusion between the value of utility and the value of exchange. In an earlier comment, I had linked this video as a humorous demonstration of the principle of Commodity Fetish. The reason it works as an example is because in this battle of the ""Dueling Hats"", each person is demonstrating that they prize the exchange value above the value of utility. The utility of a hat is to wear a hat. When the third hat appears, it's still in the bag (yet on the characters head). This hat ""wins"" that part of the duel because it has more ""marketable"" value (i.e., it's fresh from the store and has not been used). This is the heart of the Commodity Fetish.  So, Rachel Dolezal is (or, appears to be) confusing the value of utility (that the Black community is made up of humans who have a certain physical trait, i.e., the color of their skin) with the value of exchange (that skin color carries a certain amount of political and social capital, both good and bad). Therefore, rather than argue for racial equality as a white woman, she paints her face to capitalize on the social/political marketable exchange value of that particular skin color (and, in so doing, greatly dehumanizes the community she is trying to defend by reducing them to a skin color).   Hope that helps. If not, let me know and I'll take another stab at explaining it."

AskSocialScience,3alxw9,changingourworld,15,Sun Jun 21 14:55:43 2015 UTC,"Computer science has experienced a rather remarkable evolution over the years with its gender ratio. In the 1960s, anywhere from 30-50% of computer scientists and programmers were women. Because it was a new field of study and work, no one initially knew which gender was better suited for the job. As the opinion grew that entering commands into the computer was akin to being a secretary, the field opened up to women dominating the field.  As computers became more advanced, it became apparent that more advanced programs required mathematical thinking and logic to make them quick and efficient. This change in thinking is a critical turning point in the gender ratio - once the field was perceived as mathematical instead of secretarial, men with math skills began outpacing new entrants in the field, and women who perceived themselves bad at math stayed away.  The reason women haven't made much of a rebound is partly because women still perceive themselves as being worse at math than their male counterparts, but also because the overwhelming dominance of men in the field has resulted in a culture of sexism that women find to be a problem. Women aren't likely to enter back into computer science jobs until women become more confident in their mathematical and computational abilities, and the culture of sexism in math and CS jobs changes to be more inclusive.

AskSocialScience,3amouh,probablyaname,2,Sun Jun 21 19:01:52 2015 UTC,"There haven't been any replies yet to your question, but I know one way this could easily be analyzed is through Marxist sociology. The issues you mentioned are related to the issue of class conflict in capitalist societies. Sweatshops, like all other capitalist enterprises, are run by two different classes: the owning capitalist class and the workers. The former uses the latter as a means to an end for personal profit. Working conditions are then an issue of least importance to capitalists since the function of the enterprise is to generate private profit, and since workers are easily replaceable. The capitalists of the sweatshop then make foreign deals with other international capitalists (Apple).  Underfunding of public services is also related. Capitalists possess disproportionate political control over the state and use it to mold policy to their interests. This conflicts with a genuinely democratic government that is based on satisfying human needs."

As for extra-economic violence, the most famous example is South Africa's apartheid which relied upon the violent regulation of the black community to benefit national and international capitalists (have a look at someone such as Legassick or Bond for more on this).   More importantly however a total social analysis cannot separate history (or Foucault) from economics or sociology. The violence necessary for the functioning of the state is also that necessary to reproduce the capitalist system (and a stable profitable one) itself. The power of prisons or schools is ultimately an economic one. If you separate say Foucault from Marx (even if they often contradict each other) you risk transforming what is a means (violence) into an end and thus failing to understand the logic or reason that dictates the form and content of any violence. There's an absolute ton of readings on this wide topic, on racial hierarchy and economics and so on  also I'm not an economists, but I'm not sure mainstream economics deals much with this topic and even if it did it would naturally do so only partially."

Hanjin you might recognise from seeing it on the side of shipping containers, but they also own Korean Air.  These companies have a huge number of other businesses. Samsung sells insurance and builds ships, and its not at all strange to see one of these bit companies names on things like toilet paper or similar products.   And they have tremendous power.

Chaebols have also had an impact on North/South relations, and a decent amount of labour for some of these companies comes from factories they've established in North Korea.  There's also the issue of foreign companies coming in to Korea. Often the system is stacked against them, and those that have been successful have done so by partnering with a Korean multinational. They have considerable influence on commercial policy, and have been known to affect and direct certain efforts in government as well. A lot of people have become increasingly concerned that they've got too much power, and it was a concern among some that Lee Myung-bak (the previous president) was at least in some regard being influences by Hyundae (having himself once been the CEO of Hyundai Engineering and Construction).

Re: Alcohol use and dependence ""Strong bonding to school, close parental monitoring of children and clearly defined family rules for behavior, appropriate parental rewards for good behaviors, high level of refusal skills and* strong belief in the moral order* predicted a lower risk for alcohol abuse and dependence at age 21."" (I'm not sure what 'moral order' means. The article summary and editted version available at that link also does not illuminate that. I'm guessing it's just respecting laws?) Genetic predisposition: I think we can safely say that policy would not affect genetic inheritability, but accessibility could affect phenotype expression. I'll get into that soon.  Risks for drug use later in life can be predicted by ""a lack of attachment and nurturing by parents or caregivers; ineffective parenting; and a caregiver who abuses drugs"" and poor classroom behavior or social skills; academic failure; and association with drug-abusing peers."" (Worth noting this is a US government site, which is not unbiased; however, this is relatively well-established).  Then that drugabuse.gov site has this little blurb that is unexplained: ""Other factors—such as drug availability, trafficking patterns, and beliefs that drug abuse is generally tolerated—are risks that can influence young people to start abusing drugs.""   So now I want to look at rates of drug use in different countries related to access/legality. I'm going to look at the US and Portugal; this is small in scope but this is a reddit comment not a journal article! I'm doing my best and have to work in an hour. We definitely have a big correlation =! causation issue here, but I think it's interesting. And I think we can expand upon possible causation taking into account risk and protective factors:   Portugal decriminalized drug use in 2001. This chart shows an initial increase in drug use in 2001, but then a decrease in 2007 (among adults).. Click through the link in the first sentence to see that continuous use dropped. So maybe more people used drugs but fewer people kept using them. It sounds like when you turn 21 and go crazy and by the time you're 23 you're done drinking all the time. But according to this article, ""adult drug use rates [in Portugal] did slightly increase — but this increase was not greater than that seen in nearby countries that did not change their drug policies[...] [t]he changes in teen drug use were complex: throughout Europe, teen drug use rose sharply during the period in which Portugal decriminalized and then fell — the same trend was seen in Portugal but the fall was steeper."" And as far as public health goes, drug-induced deaths (easier access to care for potential overdoses may be a factor here) and HIV rates (IV drug use) went down as well. Just fun facts there, I think.       FUCK I have to go to work. I'll be back to keep updating this because now I'm really interested.

AskSocialScience,3ajcui,meowmixxed,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:15:49 2015 UTC,"Tobacco consumption is pretty unique when it comes to drug policies in the US.  Unlike most other drugs it is legal to purchase for those over the age of 18.  Additionally, laws are not the only things at play, court decisions (the Tobacco Master Settlement) as well as more individualized local programs have an effect as well (e.g. education programs).  Different policies have different effects and work to a varying degree.  However, in aggregate these policies have worked in the US, in fact lowering smoking rates was one of the CDC's 10 great public health achievements of the 20th Century source.  When it comes to minors the first thing that comes to mind with tobacco is the prohibition of sale to minors.  The data is actually pretty mixed on these types of interventions.  Enforcement is not uniform and even in areas with strict enforcement minors can access tobacco.  Here is an interesting paper looking at how minors obtain tobacco even in a strict enforcement environment.  It has been suggested raising the legal age to 21 would be more effective.  There are some studies out there on this but just anecdotally it seemed like people had a much easier time obtaining cigarettes than booze underage.    Tobacco taxes on the other hand are pretty much across the board effective.  Studies across the board have shown these taxes to be effective especially among youth (who tend to have less disposable income) and lower income individuals.  Here is a study that looks at tobacco taxes in a global context.  In general, with tobacco taxes you want the taxes to effect the sticker price, not the post tax on your receipt price as they have been shown to be more effective.  Indoor smoking bans are also very effective, as they tend to have a stigmatizing effect as well as making smoking more of a pain in the ass.  Plus it means that I can go to a bar and not have to choke on a cloud of smoke which is a nice perk.  Here is a study looking at teens only.  It isn't the best study as it is merely cross sectional but it gets across the general idea well enough and its results are consistent with more in depth study designs.  Education programs are kind of all over the place.  Some have evidence showing they work and some don't.  There has been a lot of ink spilled on the varying theories and methods of education about tobacco, which is beyond the scope of this post.  The general gist is that A it depends on the program and B education tends to be some of the least effective interventions.  It tends to remain popular because it is less invasive than taxes or smoking bans so it is politically popular.  In public health you learn virtually everything is political.  Although one big takeaway is that school based interventions are much more effective when combined with community wide efforts.  Although not a law I would argue that the Tobacco Master Settlement has had a large effect.  A little background is that the state medicaid directors/Attorney's general of 46 states sued the big tobacco companies due to the health effects/costs associated with smoking.  The tobacco companies settled and part of the settlement included a disbanding of the tobacco lobbying groups, substantially reducing their ability to effect policy.  Money was sent to the states and relatively strict advertising restrictions were enacted.  It varies how the money was spent state to state.  Some spent it on roads others tobacco education, others minority health initiatives.  Not having an active tobacco lobby/trade association is very helpful when trying to pass laws such as cigarette tax hikes which are difficult enough as is."

So just coming from the wiki entry, an insanity plea, which I think is what you'd be referring to, requires a few things.   Mental illness interfered with the defendant's ability to distinguish right from wrong - If you read Roof's manifesto, he says some things that are actually correct. He talks about the impact of race on different racial groups, how history is interpreted as skewing race, etc. And then he just takes a fact or reasonable statement and goes super racist on it. He understands right from wrong in an intellectual/emotional/mental way. While he may be incorrect about what is right or wrong, his mental health does not seem to be the cause of that mistake.  Psychosis - this would include an illness like schizophrenia, catatonia, and symptoms like delusions and hallucinations. While his racial manifesto/rant does seem to have aspects of delusion, delusion alone is not psychosis; delusion is often a part of a larger pattern of attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs that are also characteristic of psychosis.  Control of the act - so far, Roof has not made any statements that he was being controlled by someone else, asked by God or another supernatural/powerful being to act. He acted of his own accord, and it is clear in the last paragraph that he is doing this on his own because HE must, not because someone made him.  Medications (not linked with insanity pleas, but worth mentioning) - Roof took Prozac. 10% of Americans take SSRIs like Prozac. Clearly 10% of Americans don't commit mass murders like Roof. And those who are depressed but don't take SSRIs also do not. He also used drugs, like Xanax, (some less reliable sources say a methadone-type drug, cocaine, etc), and his friend described him as a pill popper.

Typical examples of anti-Semitic propaganda nowadays revolve around a few major themes:  1) Jewish control over the media, money, world, etc..  2) Jewish warmongering and other similar stereotypes.  3) The occasional comparison of Jews to apes/pigs, though this is less a stereotype and more of an insult.  4) The persistence in some small places of the old blood libel, that Jews drink the blood of children or otherwise kidnap them etc..  These stereotypes persist. Visual stereotypes usually revolve around cartoonish figures with fangs and large noses, and sometimes involve the blood libel I mentioned, but usually are related to Israel. This old page from the Anti-Defamation League contains some examples of Arab media stereotypes in portrayal of Jews.  In addition, strongly held beliefs/stereotypes of Jews can be found in the ""Global 100"" poll by the ADL. While there are some arguments that it was conducted poorly, looking at country-specific data even with possible poll response issues makes clear the stereotypes exist.  For example, in Iraq, 75% of respondents said Jews were responsible for most of the world's wars, and 80%+ believed Jews had too much control over the world's financial markets, the United States, the media, etc..  You get similar responses when you look at Saudi Arabia, to give you another example. This type of thing is very common in Arab media, and is a commonly pushed line. While selectively publishing these types of things (obviously looking for examples), MEMRI publishes a whole lot of translated videos and information in Arab media that pushes discriminatory or news-worthy statements. For example, there was recently a video accusing Israel of flooding the Arab worlds with ""drugs"" and corrupting influences like ""penis enlargement ads"". Looking through their clips reveals common debates on Israel and Jews that frequently move into anti-Semitic territory. Here is a Kuwaiti sermon from just last month, for example, using claims from the faked-propaganda Elders of Zion of old, arguing that Jews spread corruption etc..  A common debate here is whether the anti-Semitism is worse because of Israel, or would have persisted, or would have disappeared without Israel. That is hard to measure. Personally, I can't see it having disappeared without Israel, and it's pointless to engage in counterfactuals about whether or not it would've gotten to where it is today without Israel, because we can't know for sure how things would have turned out had there been a Palestinian state without Israel, had Israel lost in 1948, or in 1973, or any time like that. I can say that many historians have been debunking the myth of the ""golden age"" of relations persisting until Israel's establishment between Jews and Muslims. While Jews were treated ""better"" in the Arab world than in Europe, there was still fast-rising anti-Semitism. Bernard Lewis wrote extensively on it, and on how pre-Zionism there was still rising anti-Semitism as the level of unhappiness rose in the failing Ottoman Empire. As an aside, we also know that Nazi propaganda was broadcast throughout the Middle East, and that the propaganda appears to have left a lasting imprint on the German population that heard it, so it may have done so for the Arab population even if to a lesser extent (they did not respond to it the same way with attempts to kill Jews, mostly).  Hope that helps, I'm happy to provide more information if you'd like. Those are just some straightforward examples :)."

A further obstacle to critics of the Confederate flag: It’s affixed to the pole, and can’t come down unless someone gets up there and pulls it down — which would be illegal anyway.  “The flag is part of a Confederate War Memorial, and is not on a pulley system, so it cannot be lowered, only removed,” Raycom Media reporter Will Wilson tweeted."

Basically, in multi-variable regressions, you can compute the partial correlation between two variables holding constant some other variables association. The dependent variable is homicides per 100,000, and that means the regression model is seeking the relationship between each of those variables listed (eg income inequality) and homicides per 100,000. The two numbers you want to focus on per row are the ""b"" or beta and the standard error or ""se"". If you can divide b by two times the standard error, then that beta coefficient is ""statistically different from zero with 95% confidence"". Basically what that means is the b term is measuring the partial correlation between that particular variable and homicides. I think that because he listed ""percent black"" first that that is the key variable of interest. So how do you interpret it? For every one point change in the percent black at that geographic level (probably state), the homicide rate increases by roughly 0.1. What about all the other stuff that affects homicides? He controlled for them in his regression by including them in the model (see the 5-6 variables below it).  Is it a slam dunk? It's a valid counter argument to make that the racial disparity in homicides is robust to the inclusion of demographic and economic covariates. Ultimately it's not exactly the question we want to know though I don't think. We want to know what would have happened to the same person killed had their skin color been white not black -- same exact situation, same economic circumstances, same everything, but with a whiter pigmentation. That's the real question -- does race independently cause homicides or is it other stuff correlated with race? This table would be useful at establishing an empirical reality but wouldn't ultimately tell us the answer to that question."

While not the end of the conversation about race and crime, it is the answer to some of the more naive explanations that come up often. A considerable number of people post comments to the effect of, ""why is everyone talking about race when it's obviously all the confounding influence of [ poverty : education : variable x ]."" This is a trivial statement to test, and we see that no, race has predictive power (and a lot of it) even in the presence of those other explanations."

No sample size information is provided.   Why are some of your variables from only 2010, while others are from 2006-2010 or 2011? Since homicide rates can vary from year to year quite a bit it's important to keep things consistent, especially when you're dealing with state level data.   Was DC treated as a state- that one is always an influential outlier since it is purely urban. No low crime, low population density rural areas=ridiculously high crime rates.   Why are the standard error and coefficient for income inequality so huge? Is this variable coded as a score ranging from 0 to 1 or something similar? For that matter, how is income inequality measured and what year was that data from?  Speaking of multicollinearity, do you think that there might be collinearity between, say % in poverty, unemployment rate, and income inequality? That could bias your standard errors, maybe?  Do you think it would be more useful to test the effects of poverty/disenfranchisement using interactions between something like %black and %poverty? That way you could say blacks that are also in poverty are committing homicides, rather than just implying that more blacks=more violence? Racial segregation X poverty X low employment seems like a much more convincing explanation to me than just ""more blacks, more homicide.""   Regardless, you have a very, very long way to go before you can suggest that race causes more crime. It goes without saying that as always correlation=/= causation and there is a lot more that we'd need to address and replicate. For one thing, you'd need individual level data or at least something much more precise than state level data. Ecological fallacy and confounding is always an issue with these kinds of data. I've twisted state level data to say lots of things when teaching (e.g. smoking ""causes"" robbery in some datasets, even with controls), It's very difficult to interpret and make solid conclusions.  edit: Just occurred to me- how are your % variables scaled? I'm guessing it's 0-100% based on the effect sizes but I've also seen datasets use 0.00-1.00.  I'm also not convinced that you've measured concentrated disadvantage submitted, which is a very common and very significant control in these kinds of studies.  You should really give more context for how your results speak to the literature on this topic as well- you are just a dude running numbers right now, it's important for people to see how these results do/do not fit with more thorough peer reviewed analyses. If you do not know the literature on those topics, you probably shouldn't be playing with that kind of data and making claims as though you are an expert or master on the topic."

AskSocialScience,3a3jtc,Vladith,3,Tue Jun 16 23:13:20 2015 UTC,"Speaking as an anthropologist of the Middle East, I would say Said's work, especially Orientalism, had a strong impact in the field, but that the impact of this work must be understood as part of the broader influence of post-colonial scholarship imported from the disciplines of history and literary studies. These works have reshaped the terms of debate in much interpretive social science towards questions of political power, law, knowledge production, class difference and the relationship between the state and civil society -- all read through the prism of the colonial encounter. By now, the influence of these works in anthropology has largely been internalized and they're not the hot topics of debate they were in the 80's.   One way to track this broader transformation is to compare the articles on Middle Eastern Anthropology in the Annual Reviews of Anthropology journal. The first, by Fernea and Malarky (1975) focuses mainly on the problem of segmentary lineage and parallel cousin marriage in small-scale tribal societies, old questions that had been recently given new force by the transformative theoretical interventions of Pierre Bourdieu & Clifford Geertz. The second, by Lila Abu-Lughod (a colleague of Said at Columbia writing in 1989), puts the historical production of ethnography at the center in a highly reflexive way reminiscent of Said, although she also draws heavily on globalization theory to argue that anthropologists have too deeply associated geographic""zones"" with specific theories, loosing both specificity and generalizable in the process. Finally, we have Deeb & Winegar writing in 2012, who mention Said once in passing but do not even cite any of his works! This is not because he is no longer important but, like I said, because he is simply assumed to be right and the field has moved onto new questions responding to trends like increasing urbanization and political participation amid revolutionary change.   Whether or not Said has much influenced US policy is another question entirely. I for one seriously doubt it to be the case. To give a short example, I was recently in Washington, D.C. for a State Department sponsored educational exchange orientation with scholars and practitioners in various fields.

It's way more likely that the government would have private companies administer a single-payer plan than having them be an optional layer of coverage. Private companies already administer over 30% of Medicare plans, including the majority of plans that are actually utilized. (see my other comment) This number is already growing.  There is no way that the US government would leave private insurers stranded by nationalizing the health insurance industry and making them irrelevant except for a niche market. It would be way too risky for the government to underwrite all of that risk, and it would be way too disruptive to one of the largest industries in the US economy."

AskSocialScience,3a1mam,HealthcareEconomist3,13,Wed Jun 17 03:42:17 2015 UTC,"edit: I get that what I'm saying does not make single payer healthcare look very good, but if you're going to downvote this, please actually provide some facts supporting your point.   Most people overlook this, but Medicare and Medicaid already have over 40% of the payer market. They're not a monopsony yet, but they're getting close to it.   And at the same time, most Medicare and Medicaid plans are actually privately managed (eg Medicare Advantage). Most people who are happy with their Medicare plans are using privately managed plans, though they often don't realize it. It's fairly rare to see someone on straight Medicare or Medicaid, because quite frankly the coverage and provider availability is awful. Most people on regular Medicare plans don't actually see the doctor with them. If you look at the breakdown of hospital patients, Medicare Advantage vastly outweighs other Medicare patients. Again, this is looking at the actual plan usage; looking at Medicare eligibility is not very meaningful as it is available to all people who meet the criteria provided by law.   I seriously doubt that the US would ever adopt a single payer system that does not outsource the management of these plans to private insurers like this. The insurers wouldn't like it, and most importantly, the patients wouldn't like it.   Also, keep in mind that this would have a drastic impact on the healthcare system at large, because Medicare does not actually reimburse all of the direct costs it incurs. In 2008 it fell short by 9% which means that this cost gets passed on to private insurers. Before someone comments that healthcare is ""overpriced"", I'm talking about the actual upstream costs, not factoring in any overhead or markup for profit.   It's very easy for people to wave their hands around the aggregate numbers and say that too much money is being spent, but it's very hard to find places to actually cut those expenses while still creating a sustainable business model. Medicare does not count as a sustainable business model, because if all payers paid the same rates that Medicare does, all providers would immediately go out of business. (And it's easy to say that they need to cut their expenses, but the bulk of their expenses are determined upstream - hospitals could control them, then they wouldn't be losing money right now, which most hospitals in the US are."

AskSocialScience,3a1mam,zoso101010,6,Tue Jun 16 20:59:26 2015 UTC,"would it be a reasonable option to implement the single payer system and outsource all the management obligations?   Well, what would be the point of doing so? This would allow for less flexibility in plan coverage than simply having an insurance mandate and requiring the private insurers to insure any patient who wants coverage (which is what the ACA does).  The only thing it would do is make it harder for insurers to offer expensive plans with premium coverage. That may sound like a good thing, but it's actually not. It depends on the insurer, but ""Cadillac"" plans usually effectively subsidize the plans that offer only basic coverage. They're the most expensive for the insurer, but they're also the ones that the insurers mark up the most, so they make up the bulk of insurers' profits.  By making it harder for insurers to raise their rates on the patients who want really expensive coverage, you force them either to raise their rates on the basic plans or to reduce the scope of their coverage.   but at the end of the day would it be sustainable   Not without significantly Medicare's reimbursement rates, no (and this would mean increasing Medicare's funding significantly). Remember that I said that Medicare currently doesn't actually cover its own patients' costs, so hospitals and doctors make up the difference by charging private insurers more.   You know all the stories you've heard about an uninsured patient who gets charged a ridiculous amount of money for a small procedure? This is the reason why - they're giving the patient the sticker price for a private insurer. (It's a bit complicated in that the hospitals don't actually expect the private insurer to pay all of that; they highballing it and expect the insurer to counteroffer a rate that is much lower, but still significantly more than what Medicare pays).  Hospital billing is totally, totally fucked up. But ironically, Medicare is partly responsible for private insurance plans being more expensive, and for uninsured patients having to pay more.  You might be wondering: why don't hospitals just charge Medicare more? The answer is simple: they can't. They can't charge Medicare more for the same reason that you can't pay Comcast less. Comcast is a monopoly, which means they can charge basically whatever they want, and you can either take it or leave it. Medicare is a monopsony, which means they can pay whatever they want, and hospitals can either take it or.... take it. Hospitals are required to treat Medicare patients, so they have no power to negotiate sustainable rates with Medicare. Their only option is to lobby Congress, and that's pretty hard to do when you have razor-thin profit margins (as most hospitals do)."

AskSocialScience,3a1mam,zoso101010,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:05:44 2015 UTC,"I actually never said that.   But let me put it this way. Most businesses balance their budget by adjusting revenue (the prices of the goods they sell) as well as reducing the costs of the goods they purchase.   But Medicare is funded by the government, so it is dependent on Congress to authorize increases in its revenue (via taxes). If they need to balance their budget, the only thing they can do is cut costs, by reducing reimbursements.   They have no real incentive to increase reimbursement rates, and even if they wanted to, they would have to lobby Congress for the money to do so. This is why their reimbursements haven't kept up with inflation and don't even cover the direct costs of care, let alone any room for overhead.   It's very hard to set prices for goods in a planned market, and healthcare is no exception. By removing the ability for providers to negotiate rates (which they can do with private insurers), we eliminate the only mechanism we have to correct prices when they are either too high or too low."

In reality, if there was a switch to a single payer system, the effects would be much more political than economical in nature: did the party in power promised to cut the jobs or to maintain them in case of a systemic reform? In any case, it will take years to adjust and it's not guaranteed that the administration of the healthcare system would be that much more simple under the single payer system - this relies heavily on how much room is left for the private sector and it can easily be argued that a U.S. single payer system would leave a lot more room to private practice than a the Canadian system does right now.  That being said, there are a few economical arguments in favor of a non-thin administration:   The reductions in taxes stemming from reduced government spending will disproportionately favor the higher income earners and as we know, there's no such thing as trickle down economics. Besides in a depressed economy, administration jobs are usually not the highest paying jobs around, but they might be for a class of workers and as you pointed out: they are unlikely to save a high share of their income.  This may sound a little bit like marxist notions of class struggles, but it's a fact that not everyone has higher education and the U.S. economy doesn't provide only high paying jobs for all workers (and nearly 2 decades of tax cuts haven't changed this reality). It's important to understand that household incomes will have much more impacts than just making economy revolve, education of the future generation and reduction in crime rate are obvious examples. It also impacts on life expectancy as well, and the U.S. has some catching up to do on a lot of OECD countries.

Putting money in a mattress isn't slowing long run growth.  It's whether smart investments are being made and resources are being used to their full potential.    One argument for this relationship between growth and inequality is the political economy factors.  Inequality leads to more money influence in politics which leads to greater rent seeking. Rent seeking is not productive.  Furthermore, the influence of wealthy is largely to reduce public investments and decrease taxes. This is not optimal if those investments have a high return, like infrastructure and education.   Another is that the investments made to educate the poor is better spent than the investments made by the wealthy.

Certainly there are bad ways to invest in education for poor people.  For example, you could spend $1B on college tuition for kids from family's making less than $25k per year.

Since then, the company has sometimes used 1982 as the starting birth year. In 2012, Ad Age ""threw in the towel by conceding that Millennials is a better name than Gen Y"", and by 2014, a past director of data strategy at Ad Age said to NPR ""the Generation Y label was a placeholder until we found out more about them""   Regarding the Millennial name, it came from authors William Strauss and Neil Howe in 1992:   Authors William Strauss and Neil Howe wrote about the Millennials in Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069, and they released an entire book devoted to them, titled Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation. Strauss and Howe are ""widely credited with naming the Millennials"" according to journalist Bruce Horovitz.

For example, people of the ""greatest generation"" experienced poverty and hardship as young kids, and this belied their great sacrifices to defeat the nazis, or millenials grew up in a time where divorce was becoming much more common and now in adulthood are much less likely to get married. now i completely agree that capitalists are using the idea of generations to sell - it makes sense because a product is more valuable to someone if it also is important to their identity - their identity as a member of a generation with shared experiences is easy to market to, particularly with nostalgia (because your experiences as a kid shape who you are for life) - ever wonder why so many people click on buzzfeed articles with headlines like ""15 things that all ___ understand""  because you can read that list of 15 things and relate ot them and confirm that your identity as a ___."

Also, I think you're being a bit vague in the descriptions of the scenario.  I'm going to roll with the ""textbook definition"" and say capital account is the sales and purchases of assets, and I'll further assume it includes sales and purchases made by the central bank.  That being said, it seems you're missing an entry for each country.  Think about the countries individually.  Each transaction must have a credit and a debit, so having one country with a capital/financial account surplus and a current account of zero is impossible on its own because capital+current=0.  The missing entry will be dependent on the agents and the transaction involved.    So if by ""country x buying country y's currency"" you mean that country x's central bank buys country y's currency from country y's central bank, then it would be both an increase in the capital account and a decrease in the capital account such that the overall capital account would stay at 0.  The decrease in the capital account comes from the fact that our (let's say x) country's central bank has increased its y denominated assets.    The corresponding increase in our capital account comes from the fact that the other country has increased their holdings of x denominated assets.  So in this specific case the capital account would balance out to 0 and the current +capital =0.  Then when you add the two countries you would just get a lot of zeros added to each other.  Hope this helps."
AskSocialScience,39qyf5,utnapishtim_guy,37,Sat Jun 13 22:07:44 2015 UTC,"There are TONS of books on the topic, and it's readily apparent to see the academic biases in the various arguments you can find. If you want historical examples that have been written about in abundance, the ""Glorious Revolution"", ""Why men Rebel"" by Ted Gurr, I think, the Russian Revolution by Leon Trotsky give pretty good case studies for what a Revolution is (although you would have to define what you think a revolution is before you can try to prove your definition). Hannah Arendt is another fun route to go on if you have a philosophical itch that you want to scratch. ""On Revolution"" is a fantastic book that I would highly recommend if you like that kind of thought.   Interestingly enough, public policy text books can give you a great overview of the epistemology, and give you some ideas of the factors involved. Depending on the resources you find, you can come to very interesting conclusions of what constitutes a rebellion and how you differentiate that from a ""revolution"". It can get VERY convoluted, quickly, if you begin trying to define and differentiate revolution, rebellion, liberty, and freedom, and concepts of societal violence. Arendt, though, does a great job discussing that with historical evidence and meaning in semantics.  If you go the psycho-social route, there is a range of theories that can be combined to create a cogent argument (including some ideas from Gurr regarding relative deprivation, a ""charismatic leader"" derived from Weber, etc.), whereas more macro approaches largely point to economic disparity and resource control (Skocpol), that could pretty much amount to anything, but would invariably lead to control of arms and lateral influence. A HUGE factor to take into consideration in revolution is the military. Social upheaval can occur, but stabilization usually comes in the form of an armed presence. The pendulum can swing wildly from a ""conservative"" and ""radical"" distillation of ""liberty"" (which could be described as the absolute form of freedom), and the element that solidifies either position is usually a gun (or several, more likely) while the new norms crystallize. Foucault had some fun ideas on why a nation's military is usually separated from the general population, and spoke on the culture created from there. It gets all conspiracy-theory and entertaining."

AskSocialScience,39qyf5,Cronyx,6,Sun Jun 14 14:47:45 2015 UTC,"I think it's very unlikely. Identifying a ""spark"" that can ignite indignation to the level of revolution is pretty much impossible. Nobody predicted that a street vendor in Tunisia that resorted to self-immolation would have created the kind of reverberations that toppled governments in Libya and perhaps Egypt (arguably, the military is really the ruling class in Egypt). Although I can tell you that intelligence analysis has started taking social media social spheres of influence MUCH more seriously -- and even with movements that have little to no bearing on American media (i.e. Neo-nazi Greeks becoming more and more prominent during their economic crisis).  Tools like Crimson Hexagon (developed by Harvard) and other social media analytics are being employed to try to get a better idea of how words influence behavior via a combination of discursive analysis and good old human intelligence, but it's still very difficult to predict if a rebellious action can evolve into a full-blown revolution. Right now, there's an obsession with ideologues that conflate these somewhat marginal actors with legitimate societal actors that could create this kind of change.  I highly recommend looking into ""fragility"" indeces to look at the various factors academics and government actors use to predict instability and widespread violence. A couple of things to take note of, though: fragility indeces in 2011 did NOT list Tunisia as being particularly fragile. Also, nation-states with weak government could rank high on the fragility index, but are much more likely to experience a military coup than a revolution.   Back to Revolution: While corruption and views of injustice were rather rampant in Tunisia, revolution was not on the table in predictive analysis because of a monopoly on violence (which should really just be called ""control"", since violence, conceptually, can almost mean anything and can also be easily confused with the purely ""somatic"" manifestation). To cut this short, though, the Arab Spring ""revolutions"" occurred because of a splintering of ideological leanings within the military AND the ruling elite in Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt. To put it simply, you cannot have a real revolution without having a wide spectrum of support from people throughout the spectrum of socio-economic, political, and military statuses. Usually, though, this is when the momentum of revolution can be overtaken by a ruling elite (Napoleon in France for example, or the contemporary Egyptian military).

AskSocialScience,39qyf5,CineGory,7,Mon Jun 15 00:31:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, sociology, and social science in general, does well at historical analysis of prior revolutions, but it has produced few if any externally validated predictive theories of revolution.  Social systems are in general irreducibly complex, also involving their actors' own understanding of the functioning of this system, their role within it, and the general cultural frameworks with cultivate such perspectives, and thus a large degree of self-referentiality.  This entails that social systems are chaotic in a mathematical sense, and thus fundamentally difficult to model, even given rich knowledge of the relevant input factors.  I think that Kurzman's The Unthinkable Revolution in Iran does well in illustrating how revolution as it unfolds tends to defy the understanding (let alone the predictive capabilities) of its participants; it is a fundamentally chaotic process, often involving a wide variety of forces not set in any apparently discernible systematic relation with one another (http://www.amazon.com/Unthinkable-Revolution-Iran-Charles-Kurzman/dp/0674018435).  In the Iranian case, it was unclear (argues Kurzman) that the revolution would involve establishment of an imam-centered theocratically oriented regime, as socialist and feminist unrest, among other forces, loomed quite large indeed.

I think that this factor played a key role, and one can also draw analogies with racial dynamics here.  Namely, processes of racialization seem to depend on exclusionary practices undertaken by the dominant racial group.  As this group discriminates against multiple ethnicities and establishes oppressive institutions that treat particular sets of ethnicities similarly, these ethnicities tend to come to constitute a race.  For example, it is in the context of racism against a variety of disparate nationalities (and cultures) that various Latin American identities coalesced in the US as a racial group, ""Hispanics"".  This shared condition of oppression further inspired unified political resistance to anti-Latino racism, further consolidating Hispanic/Latino as a racial identity*  Similarly, it is partially because homophobes tended to treat a variety of LGBTQ groups similarly that they formed a unified identity and shared collaborative project of resistance.  *In this case, these ethnicities did have moderately related cultures, and political and cultural dynamics in various Latin American countries exerted a strong influence, particularly given the role of trans-national migration."

AskSocialScience,39oa4p,broletariat_,4,Sat Jun 13 04:57:00 2015 UTC,"Though I am a political scientist by trade, I have done extensive research on the history, rules, and structure of the Catholic Church, so I think I can take a stab at this. The Pope's power doesn't necessarily lie in the immediate changes. He of course has one of the biggest soapboxes in the world, and can shape the debate by opening his mouth. Kramer (2009) for instance argues that the church exerted influence on the political liberalization of Poland and helped shape the debate in forming and constituting a parliament. Closer to some of my own research, the church plays a role in Mexico mobilizing indigenous communities (Trejo 2009). (I would also Recommend the book ""Popular Movements in Autocracies: Religion, Repression and Indigenous Collective Action in Mexico"" by Trejo (2012) if you are interested in the question.)  However, his real power lies in appointment of bishops and cardinals. These clergy have the ability to set agenda for the next 40 years. They do this directly by issuing statements and giving diocese wide sermons which priests under them must read. (In the united states this has often been used by more conservative bishops in election seasons to remind people of pro-life issues). However, they also do this indirectly by choosing who becomes clergy in the first place. They act as gate keepers, selecting candidates for ordination, which then leads to more priests who think like they do, not only on moral issues, but also on political and economic issues. It is important to note that Francis is a moderate-liberal (in the context of the church), and that JP2 was very conservative and had a hand in giving us a very Conservative Legacy. This gives support to their ability to mobilize the public.  Here is where I will turn to my wheelhouse. From these two arguments we can see that the church's power is really in mass mobilization. So the amount of influence the church has on political elites and decision makers is a function of how much those decision makers pay attention to the people in general and catholics in particular. In political science there is a theory called the ""Selectorate theory"" which has been taken up by a sizable amount of political scientists. In the book ""Logic of Political Survival"" Bueno de Mesquita et al (2003) argue that in every country there is a selectorate which has the ability to select the next leader. Leaders further have a subset of this, the winning coalition, which is the coalition of the selectorate which put the current ruler in power and whom the current ruler, if he is logical and wishes to keep office, will attempt to keep happy. I understand that this oversimplifies things but this is a model and models do that for ease of explanation.   Since the church's power is really only in mass mobilization. It could be argued that the pope's power is a function of democracy, and the number of Catholics in the winning coalition. In the United states Catholics don't make much of what we would call likely voters, with the exception of Hispanic communities which are not nationally distributed. So in the united states we might see that the pope has little power in politics except in mobilizing this population. If we look across the developing world however the story is different. If we have elites which have to keep people happy (a big if in the global south) then we see the church taking on a greater role. In El Salvador, we see the church actively leading the way with reading groups which also function as political discussion groups (Wood 2003). [Look up Mongomery (1992) for an interesting discussion about the split in the church hierarchy during the 1960-1980s]. In Argentina and Chile we see that the church has greater leeway to investigate disappeared persons and to file legal claims during the 1970s-1980s (Black 2002).  So, to sum up: the pope's power is really administrative, or rather, is the power to appoint bishops and cardinals who will then choose his successor, but more importantly will then set the agenda of the church as a whole.

You can look at the wikipedia page for Moore's law and it's up to the brim with different components that we are making more efficiently. Moore himself saw a correlation between the number of components on a circuit and the relative cost to make the components (see page 2 here)."
AskSocialScience,39n4gk,dt084,9,Fri Jun 12 23:30:30 2015 UTC,"(I apologize for hijacking your post, but don't want to go find a bunch of meaningless citations for common business principles.)  One reason costs go down is that early adopters are generally willing to pay more for a product. They tend to be more tech savvy and have higher disposable income. They like having things that are cutting edge and are willing to pay a premium.   Another reason could be that initially manufacturing is less efficient. The cost per unit of a good will decline as orders for components are made in higher volume and other efficiencies are gained in the manufacturing process.   As /u/My_Name_Too mentioned, Moore's law is a factor as well. Even though it may be over a short time frame, if Product X needs a 100GB hard drive, that hard drive will be cheaper today than it was 12-months ago. Assuming Product X still has the same specs, there can be a lot of savings here.   Another reason for declining prices could be over production or a significant drop in demand. Once a product is produced, that manufacturing cost is a sunk cost to the producer. Even selling the product at a loss could make sense if the alternative is having a bunch of unwanted inventory (i.e., selling it for $100 even though it cost $300 is still better than not selling it at all). Demand can also decrease due to competition and a greater levels of alternatives.  Sometimes a product could also become a loss leader. Let's say I make a special pen with some incredibly innovative ink. At first I may need to sell the pen and ink as a bundle (since no one will already own a compatible pen), but if this pen begins to become widely used, it might make sense to move to a strategy where I essentially give the pen away to sell more ink (particularly if I have higher profit margins on my ink).  This is by no means an exhaustive list of reasons, but I tried to elaborate on a few common ones."

AskSocialScience,39n4gk,HEHVHEHVmonstersound,5,Sat Jun 13 12:47:56 2015 UTC,"There's a nice lecture on this topic by Doyne Farmer here. The associated paper is here Certain classes of technologies, largely technologies which can get smaller and more integrated with each iteration, tend to get cheaper through time on a roughly exponential trajectory. The best fit for this is not actually Moore's Law (though Moore's Law is not a bad fit) but Wright's Law, which is essentially learning through doing. So basically with each product iteration the process is smoothed out, the supply chain is refined, costs are optimized, usually the product becomes smaller and more integrated etc.   Other categories are useful to contrast this. As Robert Ayres notes most prime mover technologies (such as turbines) have shown little or no improvement in efficiency over many years. These products tend to have fairly fixed scales for optimal output and once they are refined to their physical limits (a turbine's maximum efficiency for example tends to be defined by metallurgic properties). Once these limits are hit the cost for an additional 1% improvement in performance tends to be exponentially higher than the mature product design.   So that's the supply side. The demand side is largely branding, creating a status or market segmentation for the brand etc. There is often artificial scarcity used as a strategy here or marketing to an elite class of early adopting trendsetters. Pricing is carefully considered here. The best example i can think of is jeans. For all intents a purposes the most you can pay to make a pair of jeans is about $3 import $5 domestic. So from a cost perspective there's little difference between a pair of 60$ Levis and a $200 pair of Acne's. The price and a few design details creates a market segmentation.   As to your thought experiment. This is more or less what happens now no? People pay a lot for relatively low feature products (ie. microphoneless 1 gen apple products) and much less for second gen feature rich products. The danger in a small coop would be that price declines would be predictable and therefore a deflation spiral dynamic could emerge where people try to wait out price declines. For most technologies however the costs are heavily front loaded so this would mean most products wouldn't generate enough cash flow to sustain them through their production cycles."

The next batch are the smallest group - the ones that think they'll become marketable with Psych. Problem is they won't, so hope to god they have a second major or they'll end up as a secretary.  The largest group is the listeners / those who struggle themselves. Many will go onto social work, which is fine, but it too them too long to realize that phD in clinical is one of the most competitive phd positions and because they were mostly focused on their own issues they forgot to get involved in research.  Then there's the even smaller group, like me, who doesn't want to fix people's issues and just wants to research conflict.   Oh and psych is very malleable and fits into many double majors.

AskSocialScience,39n1ap,Lite-brite,7,Fri Jun 12 22:18:04 2015 UTC,"There are big differences between transgender people and these non-existent trans racial people I keep hearing about. Let me copy and paste a response I made elsewhere.  The difference between wanting to be black and wanting to be the opposite sex is that it is absolutely possible to be the opposite sex and there is a biological drive for people who want to change sexes. These two things are false for someone wanting to be black. Also, I'm sure virtually no one wants to change their ethnicity, and certainly no one is committing suicide over it.  First, hormone therapy is cheap and affordable, it's mostly all a trans person needs. You just take pills everyday to suppress one sex hormone and replace it with another and you get results like these:  http://mschorlor.com/2009/03/18/successsful-transmen-around-the-world/  http://ll-media.tmz.com/2012/05/20/0520-beauty-pageant-transexual-apimages-2.jpg  https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/8c/66/3e/8c663eae8113be0f82c95b661805da40.jpg  http://imgur.com/a/VUEOJ#0  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/11/kylan-arianna-wenzel-transgender-miss-california_n_2457523.html  Read through these to see the effects hormone therapy has:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormonereplacement_therapy(male-to-female))  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormonereplacement_therapy(female-to-male))  second, there are biological reasons for why someone is transgender. Look at these studies:   They found significant differences between male and female brains in four regions of white matter – and the female-to-male transsexual people had white matter in these regions that resembled a male brain (Journal of Psychiatric Research, DOI: 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2010.05.006). ""It's the first time it has been shown that the brains of female-to-male transsexual people are masculinised,"" Guillamon says.  Surprisingly, in each transsexual person's brain the structure of the white matter in the four regions was halfway between that of the males and females   In female to males (FtMs) these regions matched the same brain regions in men and in MtF they are halfway between male and female. Not just that, these regions are believed to be related to body perception.   It connects the parietal lobe [involved in sensory processing] and frontal lobe [involved in planning movement] and may have implications in body perception.   http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20032-transsexual-differences-caught-on-brain-scan.html#.VXj_v0aIUxJ  On top of that, trans women have less exposure to androgens, which are responsible for masculinization in the womb   Our findings support a biological etiology of male-to-female transsexualism, implicating decreased prenatal androgen exposure in MFT   http://www.psyneuen-journal.com/article/S0306-4530%2805%2900177-0/abstract  Also, studies of identical twins and fraternal twins are used to determine if something has a genetic component. Identical twins have exactly the same DNA and share the womb, and fraternal twins have different DNA and share the womb. They are used to prove that things like bipolar disorder, autism, and personality all have a genetic component. If identical twins have a higher rate of both having the same condition than fraternal twins, that proves that that condition is at least partly genetic.  And in twin studies of transgenderism, they prove just that.   More specifically, within this combined data pool there is a 33.33% concordance among monozygotic male twins compared with a 4.76% concordance among dizygotic male twins. In addition, there is a 28.38% concordance among monozygotic male and female twins compared to a 0.34% concordance among dizygotic male and female twins.   So the concordance rate (rate of both twins having the condition) for transgenderism in male and female identical twins is 33% and 28.38% while the rate for male and female fraternal twins is 4.76% and .34%. That shows there is a large genetic component to transgenderism.  http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2010to2014/2013-transsexuality.html  This study reviewed other studies that looked at the effects of different levels of prenatal hormones on gender based behavior and concluded that:  Also, when researchers manipulated prenatal hormone levels in rats, they could make the rat behave similar to females:   Male rats were prenatally (Day 10-19 of pregnancy) exposed to an antiestrogen, nitromifene citrate (CI628, 1 mg/rat), or an antiandrogen, cyproterone acetate (CA, 10 mg/rat), and in adulthood were examined for their exhibition of male-typical and female-typical behavior pattern. Treatment with CI628 abolished the capacity of the adult intact male to ejaculate, enhanced his potential to exhibit feminine sexual behavior, and decreased the intensity of the level of female-oriented behavior in a two-choice stimulus situation (estrous female vs active male)   If hormones have such an effect on rats why don't they have that effect on humans?  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7557922  So trans people's brains are wired differently, it is actually possible to change sexes, they've had differing exposure to sex hormones in the womb, there is a strong genetic factor according to twin studies, and that manipulating hormones in rats directly influences their gender based behavior which indicates humans operate similarly. If these facts were true for those wanting to change race, I don't think it would be as ridiculous as it is now."

And how could we possibly verify that validity?   So to rephrase, is it valid to identify non-cis if your drivers are only social? I don't think this is too hypothetical as there are people who want to identify as animal species, which is social rather than biological. This being the case it follows logically that there must be people who identify as trans as a result of social drivers. Are they then invalidated? And if they are not invalidated, then does this mean that we should accept identities that are based on social drivers rather than biological, and at that point how is race different?

They've tried hypnosis, behavioral modification (rewards and punishments to change behavior), psychoanalysis (trying to talk someone out of transgenderism), Reparative therapy (making patients do typically masculine things, such as sports), and many more techniques but nothing has been effective. (As a side note, the ""treatment"" for transgender people is basically the same treatment gay people get from these therapists.)  It would be wrong to assume a significant population of these people exist without evidence. One of the stereotypes that transgender people are fighting is that transgenderism can ""spread,"" and that only social factors are involved. Parents use this theory as an excuse to force their son/daughter to not transition against their will, and people use it as an excuse to resist transgender rights.

They should also be helping you figure out how to do this.  In that case, are you doing structured or semi-structured interviews?  I imagine semi-structured would be better. Look, you'll figure out what's important and what's not.  Practice asking the sorts of questions you want on your friends a few times before you go out into the field, just so you have the hang of it.  Remember that some people will take much shorter (they'll give short answers) and some people you will have strong rapport with (it'll take longer).  Remember that people are basically doing you a favor by talking with you, so you don't want to waste their time, but some people will be happy to give their time freely.  I think if you can do the whole interview in 30 minutes, minimum, that would be great, and then with the talkers it will be much longer.  But in half an hour, you can probably ask about all those things.  Patterns will come up inductively.  A lot of people like Becker's Tricks of the Trade, they find it really useful for thinking about how to analyze qualitative research.  More broadly, though, it seems like you're doing qualitative research with a quantitative mindset.  Even if we keep the quantitative ""independent variable"" and ""dependent variable"" thinking, which it seems like you're doing with gender identity as the dependent variable and ""socializing factors"" as your independent variables, I'm not sure your data gathering method is the most effective one.  Think carefully about the questions you want to ask in light of what you're trying to understand.  Sure, a ""sexual role inventory"" can capture a standarized measure of gender identity, but does it capture how these people understand their own gender identities?  How their gender identities have changed over time?  The whole assumption in this research is that socializing-->gender identity, but what if we think about gender identity going back and influencing socialization (little Johnny played with dolls and that affected how he experienced school, church, etc).  I'd try to structure your approach in such a way that you will have something no matter if the relationship goes either way.  With a small sample, and a lot of possible relationships, I'm not sure what you quite expect to find.  In six months in which you have to do research, write it up, and do all the reading in the secondary literature, you're not going to conduct all that many interviews, in all likelihood.  That's just the way these projects go.  10-30, would be my guess.  Now, with that information, what would be interesting?  You could focus on retrospective moments where people were non-conforming and socialized into conforming, for example, where those came from.  Or you could look deeply into how people were able to express their gender identity, what paths were thwarted and what ones weren't.  Or you could look at how gender identity shaped their social networks, or engagement with the media or whatever.  But you're not going to be able to develop a correlation between ""going to prep school"" and ""being allowed to expressed non-conforming identity"" or ""going to language school"" and ""being forced to conform"".  Look at paths ways, look at meaning, look at self-understanding. Looking for associations is harder, especially if you end up with like 10 people (unless you have two very distinct populations--then you can compare the populations).  If you think of gender identity as an independent, rather than a dependent, variable it might be easier for you--how gender identity affects things, rather than how things affect gender identity.  There's a great article, also by Howie Becker, called ""Becoming a marihuana user"".  It's old and pretty short, but it's one of the things that I often seen assigned to students to show what you can do with qualitative research.  That's an example of where gender identity could be a sort of dependent variable, ""Becoming my gender identity""."
AskSocialScience,39jiu9,insert90,40,Fri Jun 12 04:08:29 2015 UTC,"Los Angeles is already absolutely massive compared to San Fransisco, at about ten times the land area, and almost half again as large as San Diego. SF is so homogenous because it is small and developed early. San Diego has almost as many weird boundaries as LA, for similar reasons I will detail.  As to why it looks so weird, you'll first have to remember that even into the early 40s LA was less a city and more a network of smaller towns and villages with lots of open, semi-arid agricultural land and oil wells spread between them, resembling nothing close to the sprawling, unbroken development that exists today.   There were many, many annexations in LA's history. To simplify things a bit the earliest annexations were the areas around downtown (the original town), followed by the Port of Los Angeles, in the far south and a little later the long, thin strip connecting the two. Later still annexations were driven by water, as the towns expanded in the teens and twenties, it was easier to join LA and their supply from the Los Angeles Aqueduct than come up with their own source of water, especially in the very dry San Fernando valley (the large blob in the North).   Now, why did some areas not get annexed? The answer to that lies to some degree in racial politics. Some of the enclaves and neighboring independent cites - Beverly Hills, Inglewood, and Culver City were planned All White communities. Annexation votes were defeated in both - they'd apparently rather have paid more for water than join to a less-segregated community. Others - Burbank, Glendale, and Pasadena, all bordering on the Northeast side - were already established railroad cities, and Santa Monica, an already established wharf and resort city on the coast to the west, didn't need the services provided by annexation.   The areas in the south of the county, with the exception of some land around the port, didn't start to urbanize until post WWII. By then suburban developments were in fashion and suburbs are lothe to join a big city and take on it's problems and, especially, taxes. Water was no longer a driver either as LA was now allowed to sell outside the city and other sources were developed.   Here is an excellent visualization of the development of LA county.

Or you're brought to a level of irrational thought or Behavior that's uncommon for you. PTSD is a great way to think of it. It can be a terrible, day-destroying experience.

What is the general consensus among social scientists? Is there one?
AskSocialScience,39nhzu,mrsamsa,3,Sat Jun 13 19:10:34 2015 UTC,"The consensus is essentially just that there is little evidence to support the ""effectiveness"" (however you want to measure that) and the potential harm.   But there are currently no accepted arguments or reasons to think that they could be dangerous in any way at all. Some people in popular media have suggested that they could be 'dangerous' because treatments for PTSD-related trauma is exposure, and avoidance can be a symptom of their problems. This fundamentally misunderstands what a symptom is (i.e. it's it's a sign of a problem, so there is no reason to think that increasing a symptom will increase the problem), and more importantly misunderstands how exposure therapy works.  Treatments involving exposure need to be heavily controlled and the patient always needs to have warnings about what is coming up, and they need to have the opportunity to leave if it gets too much for them. Essentially, the main form of exposure therapy (systematic densensitisation) utilises a kind of trigger warning. If we were to force people to be exposed, without warning, and essentially throw them in the deep end, then this is a type of exposure known as ""flooding"" and isn't really practiced any more because it's so dangerous and usually aggravates the problem.   Also it's a mistake to view trigger warnings as an ""avoidance"" mechanism. It's an informational tool that gives people time to prepare themselves for the upcoming content, not to avoid it."

Group cohesion was crucially important in the early days of human civilisation, and required strong demarcation between our allies and our enemies. To thrive, we needed to be part of a close-knit tribe who’d look out for us, in exchange for knowing that we’d help to look out for them in kind. People in your tribe, who live in the same community as you, are more likely to be closely related to you and consequently share your genes.  As a result, there’s a powerful evolutionary drive to identify in some way with a tribe of people who are “like you”, and to feel a stronger connection and allegiance to them than to anyone else. Today, this tribe might not be a local and insular community you grew up with, but can be, for instance, fellow supporters of a sports team or political party.   This line bothers me the most. It seems to assume that we have ""evolved"" from the ""phase"" of a tribe, but retaining our ""tribal past"" otherwise. This put people still living in tribes today as people in the less evolutionized phase. It assumes societies work in linear stair of progress. While the whole idea of othering is common, this passage completely makes this piece like something out of 19th century terrible colonialist writing."

Nowadays, food like this is relatively cheap and easy to get, so we consume too much of it, on average.  If the environment changes without any adaptive pressure to change, past adaptations and by-products remain stable even if they have negative effects.  A more common critic of the group cohesion scenario presented in the article is probably the implicit assumption of some form of group selection.

Those who deny evolution and certain segments of the anti GMO movement, are certainly both ""anti-science"" but neither are allies or agree on very much.  Giving an overarching narrative that includes all groups is going to be difficult if not impossible.  The anti-vaccine movement is as old as vaccines themselves for example.  That movement is and has a different history and trends than lets say global warming denial.  Research has shown that people tend to work backwards not forwards from solutions to whether the problem exists.  Here is a journal article that looks at the issue.  Basically, peoples disbelief of science is motivated by their distaste for the solutions to said problems.  Whether solutions are compulsory vaccination or carbon taxes there are people who don't like the solutions.  Most science is actually accepted without too much trouble.  Really only science that either conflicts with people's identity or has policy implications is controversial.  This I would posit is likely the fundamental underlying cause of anti-science movements.  Each particular anti-science movement will have different characteristics.  These are historical in nature.  Sometimes corporate interests have a hand in muddying the waters, tobacco and global warming are examples of this, other times like GMO's or vaccines the efforts are more grassroots.  Using vaccination as an example; there has been a rise in the amount of vaccine delayers and anti vaccine movement in recent years. source  However, the movement is incredibly old and has taken many forms, both religious and secular.  The rise in vaccine refusal has a variety of likely causes.  One of the most popular is that due to the near eradication of many vaccine preventable diseases parents do not understand the risks of non-vaccination, this is the hypothesis of the previous source.  Others look to celebrity endorsements, the rise of the internet, poor information, lack of trust, and opposition to mandatory vaccination.  In general, blaming postmodernism is a bogeyman not a real hypothesis.  The quote you reproduce is laughably bad philosophical interpretation.  This type interpretation of Nietzsche or postmodernism would not receive a passing grade on an undergraduate essay.  Philosophy and to a large extent history of science has moved away from the concept of science existing as a kind of separate enterprise gradually moving towards objective truth.  Thomas Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions is an interesting introduction to the topic, albeit not the most current state of affairs.  Culture and biases implicate not only what we research and how but also how we interpret certain answers.  These types of analyses don't say there is two sides to every issue or that everyone has their own truth.  Saying that truth is not an objective standard or is a social constructed does not mean that everyone has their own truth, rather it looks at how truths and scientific discourse are not separate from their time and culture."

So, it's almost more of a sociological question in so far as we want understand why  such an uncritical acceptance of that position is so pervasive in popular culture.   It's not like there aren't stronger arguments for various forms of relativism or perspectivism, but there's really no discussion to that effect in mainstream discourse. Hell, there's barely ever a distinction being made between different forms of relativism (i.e. cultural, moral, epistemic and so on..).  As you've noted in your forth para, uncritical views are probably the result of a lack of information, education, pop culture influences and just the sheer ubiquity of poor--or downright harmful--information on the internet.

AskSocialScience,39av5k,haalidoodi,23,Thu Jun 11 13:01:46 2015 UTC,"Admittedly this is anecdotal, but in my experience the only people blaming the humanities and post-modernism for attacking science and ""objective truth"" are the people that post biotruths and other shit and don't like it when people call them racist or sexist. Postmodernism isn't about challenging correlations in data found through the scientific method, but in realizing that, to put it simply, human minds are extremely vulnerable to a wide range of biases, and that just because somebody has some numbers backing up their positions doesn't make them right.   If you were to go to a typical humanities academic, they wouldn't have anything particularly against the scientific method, besides the obvious problem of induction. The main argument, rather, is that the induction problem, combined with the various biases that psychological research has confirmed we are incredibly vulnerable to, can cause a blind faith in objective truth to turn into something quite horrid. The American eugenics movement believed itself to be science-based, while the Nazis (to use an extreme example) believed their view to be supported by scientific ""fact"". Critics are quick to argue that postmodernism is quick to conflate the objective and the subjective, or the whole ""feels vs reals"" idea you see on forums so much. The unfortunate fact is, however, that thanks to the way our brains work, these two areas actually significantly overlap. We're not machines, we're human, and we have to accept that. To add in my own opinion, it is absolutely not something to be concerned about, but something to be thankful for. Every movement, from the mundane like mainstream political parties to the radical like creationists will use numbers to make their side look like the ""objective truth"". If anything, the postmodernism you reference simply says that we shouldn't take ""facts"" at face value and should fully explore an issue from multiple angles before making a decision on it.

There are a lot of institutional factors that go into scientific research and there's definitely room for significant bias in what is deemed scientific truth.  But it's possible to detect a certain amount of that bias if you know how to look for it.  I think the issue is that people don't know how to (and don't know that they need to) basically evaluate a whole body of literature in order to come to any sort of conclusion about a certain topic.    I've (anecdotally) found that this is especially true with the social sciences, which tend to rely on converging evidence from multiple studies to come to conclusions.  People on reddit love to argue about social issues using anything they can find, including but not limited to pseudoscience, facts they pull out of nowhere, and hard science principles that aren't appropirate to apply to the social sciences.  If they're really well-sourced they might cite a misinterpreted journal article.  The people who are doing a majority of the arguing about social issues think they're backing up their claims with facts and science, but they don't have the background in social science to understand that while we do have tentative answers to some of these things, they're not simple answers that you can get from a single journal article or infographic.

So we're all standing around, looking for a sign to act, but since nobody's acting, it's relatively easy for people to misread the signals and conclude that there's nothing wrong or that no action is needed.   Should you ever find yourself in this situation, where you need help but passers-by are reluctant to act, one of the best things you can do is single people out. Don't just wait for some Good Samaritan to come by and help you of their own accord. Get a person's attention. Ask them for help directly. By making the situation more personal for them, you can mitigate some of that bystander effect."

AskSocialScience,39aigw,Jazzpear,3,Wed Jun 10 23:39:11 2015 UTC,"research shows that the bystander effect is primarily caused by three sub effects, diffusion of responsibility, evaluation apprehension,  and pluralistic ignorance.  The diffusion of responsibility means that the witnesses of an accident will have a emotional cost of non-intervention that is reciprocal with the number of other witnesses that the witness observe in the vicinity of the the emergency. In the extreme case, this emotional cost can become so low that the witness perceives the the cost of intervention is higher and thus chooses not to intervene. The evaluation apprehension is related to the ambiguity of the emergency, in other words whether there really is an emergency or not - maybe it's just someone shouting up for no good reason. and studies have shown that the bystander effect diminishes when the emergency is more dangerous to the victim and also that it diminshes the less ambiguous the situation is perceived by the witness.  The pluralistic ignorance relates to misperceived social norms and perpetuates the longer time endures before the victim is help. So if you believe that it is morally right to help a victim at first, and you see apathy in the eyes of other bystanders you will end up apapting this apathy and conform to the norm, if everyone of the witnessses runs through the same process of pluralistic ignorance within their head, this will perpetuate in the group of witnesses as a whole.  much of what I have referred to can be further investigated in the meta-study of the bustander effect by Fischer et. al from 2011.  There is much to be done to counter the bystander effect, one of which is to limit ambiguity, which can be done on a variety of ways, but an advice to victims would be to be more expressive about the need for help, and also address a single witness as /u/unwholesome points out. Education about the three effects might also be helpful, and especially educating about pluralistic ignorance will cause witnesses to believe more in their moral compass.  Lastly educating the public in the act of helping alone, will make them better at tackling emergencies, as witnesses who are more capable of aiding in an emergency are more likely of helping."

AskSocialScience,39aelx,AbsurdistHeroCyan,2,Wed Jun 10 15:01:36 2015 UTC,"The top of your list, should include geography. The cities of Auckland, Vancouver and somewhat Sydney are directly limited by the geographical area being broken up by the ocean and bays. This limits the amount of land available for building, driving prices higher, in an area which is in demand.  Previously, these port cities were extremely useful due to shipping and trade, but with the advent with things such as water wells, damns, and indoor plumbing, making cities possible in the desert,  the proximity to water is now just an inconvenience for burgeoning cities.    The unique case would be London, since land is readily available.  This video gives a fairly good explanation of London, as it pertains to the residences of the wealthy, and proximity to these hubs of wealth and commerce. The video also goes on to explain the reasons for holding onto property, even though it is being underutilized.     There is also an increase in expectations of standard of living in a modern society.   Previously, you might have had a family of four in every 100m2, now you have that for every person in an urban area. But you also have modern construction, which allows for vertical addition of space, instead of horizontal urban sprawl, to increase living space.  This coupled with an increase in population, leads to a rise in urban prices.      Can anything be done about it?  Building and zoning laws, for these cities, makes it impossible, and illegal to build outside of the laws. So you can't just put up teepees and call it a day. One remedy is to sell properties to their tenants creating housing boards, LLCs or the like, and a group of owners.  This is similar to gated communities and condos where all residents own their own homes, but have to abide by the community rules. This creates personal responsibility, and indebts an owner to them self, and not to a landlord.  However, there would need to be laws governing these organizations.  But the problem arises because the people or corporations which own the properties, actually have a net income from owning and leasing properties, you would have to persuade them, or make it financially burdensome through legislation, to own residential income properties, but make building such properties financially enticing."

AskSocialScience,396aw0,tuna_HP,3,Tue Jun 9 15:49:34 2015 UTC,"I'll respond to your short term concerns in order:  1) You may be confusing a land value tax with a property tax. Property taxes tax the value of what's built on the land. Land value taxes tax the value of the land itself. Property taxes are distortionary, land value taxes aren't. So it wouldn't really matter what the couple had built on the land, or how much equity they had sunk into a house.In fact, if in your example the state ends property taxes as well as income taxes, the tax liability of the couple in question could go down.   2) Nothing would really change for those people. It doesn't matter why the market values their land, what matters is that it does. If they could sell their land at a profit before the LVT, they could sell it after the LVT too, albeit at less profit. The rate determining step here is to determine what the appropriate LVT rate should be such that it doesn't force profits negative. That's an empirical question, you'd likely do some sort of hedonic regression and average out land prices to figure out the optimal rate. Note, though, that price of land will only fall by the present discounted value of all future tax payments. Apart from the very first seller of the land, for all buyers and sellers thereafter the tax will be priced into the value of the land ex ante.  3) Precisely the opposite. Rents don't go up because the supply of land is inelastic. As we know, tax incidence is wholly determined by elasticities of supply and demand within a market. Because land supply is inelastic, the incidence of the tax falls essentially wholly on the rentier. Consider a hypothetical, where without any taxes at all a rentier must determine what level of rent they want to charge in order to profit maximize. They survey the market, as well as their own costs, and arrive at some given value of rent. This is the rent where they take the most money possible from tenants. Now let's say the government introduces and LVT, and starts extracting some of the rentier's profits. Can the rentier change rents to increase profit? Nope, insofar as they've already been charging the maximum extraction rate from tenants. In effect, they're forced to eat the tax. Any attempt to deviate from the market rate will see them competed out of the market (assuming no frictions like searching costs. While said frictions certainly exist, they don't change the fundamental direction or magnitude of the analysis). Rents decrease once development of land occurs and more property is built (more of a medium term equilibrium)  4) Again, precisely the opposite. Our current property tax structure disincentivizes development because it taxes what you build on land. That's a problem. A land value tax actually incentivizes development because it only taxes the land, leaving what you build on it as a tax exempt stream of income (apart from income taxes that is). Not developing on land subject to an LVT would essentially be irrational.   Edit: For more on the glory of the LVT, see The Economist and the paper Stiglitz recently published."
AskSocialScience,3937e5,isittooearlytodrink,74,Mon Jun 8 22:49:39 2015 UTC,"Well, you can start out with the obvious stuff:  Men tend to dominate in violent crime statistics, so we would expect most shooters in general to be male. Many of these killers suffer from mental illness (do note that many are not judged to be psychotic when they actually commit the crime) - off the top of my head, 95% sure the Aurora shooter was schizophrenic, which is more common in men than women. Antisocial personality disorder is also relatively common in mass killers, and again more present in men than women. Do note that it's pretty hard to get good data on this, as the people who perpetrate these massacres usually don't survive. Furthermore, most killers, especially adolescents, rely upon having access to firearms, and white people are relatively more likely to own guns than non-whites.  There's also, however, arguments from the psyche of these killers. One way to examine mass shooters is as a subset of murder-suicides, since, again, most shooters do not survive nor expect to survive. A notable shared characteristic here is that murder-suicides are also massively, massively skewed towards males, even moreso than ""normal"" homicides. This is a very good paper that examines how masculinity can interact based on case studies of murder suicides, including several of the bigger and more relevant school shootings of late. Note that murder suicide in general trends towards older men - it may be as simple as mass killers selecting different targets, since their victims often include people they're intimate with.   In essence (for people who don't want to sort through something that might be hard to get): social expectations to be ""masculine"" can have very detrimental effects on men. They can cause men to be less willing to seek out mental health services, more willing to commit violence (violence is an easy way reassert a person's masculinity), less capable of dealing with emotions (and more likely to repress those), etc. A man's self-worth and identity is often intrinsically tied to his masculinity - being emasculated is an extremely frequent predecessor to murder suicide in general, whether it is social rejection, divorce, being ostracized, etc. Financial stresses have similar effects; note how men are expected to be breadwinners and be able to provide for themselves. These leave some people feeling very powerless and angry at the world, and taking up a gun happens to be a very quick way to take that power back.   And, if it interests you, this paper brings out a whole another set of massacre case studies, primarily those committed by adolescents."

So you'll get reports of them being ""mentally ill"" based on comments by the mother saying things like, ""He just wasn't right! From a young age I always thought there was something wrong!"".

Because most studies suggest that rates of violence among the mentally ill are staggering low compared to the rest of the population so it seems strange to use it as a possible explanation for why the population in the OP are more likely to commit the crimes.  A point you touched on is something which is more likely, in my opinion, which is that substance abuse is more strongly associated with these kinds of violent actions and young males are (I presume) often victims of substance abuse issues.

It's much better to understand that relationship is essentially never cause and effect, but specific disorders can still be risk factors.

Even if we accept the idea that there is an association between the perfect storm group of severely mentally ill patients who have problems with substance abuse, noncompliance with medication taking, and a lack of insight into their problem with being more violent than the average person, I don't think this necessarily translates into them being more likely to be mass shooters.    There also is, notably, a bit of difficulty in diagnosing people who are already dead, but many shooters do have medical histories that precede their crimes, which still places the prevalence of illness in shooters well above that of the general population.

AskSocialScience,3937e5,aioli-please,29,Tue Jun 9 15:22:04 2015 UTC,"In at least one case, it was pure coincidence.   Charles Whitman requested in his suicide note that an autopsy be performed because he couldn't make sense out of his own violent impulses. The doctors discovered a small tumor in his brain. He was white, but this was surely unrelated to the tumor.  Note that this seems to be an exceptional case, since mentally ill people are usually not violent. Possibly, though, it may have acted as a precedent (see below).  In the other cases, one could argue from the general case to the specific.  Generally speaking, the sort of violence by mass shooter fits the category of ""revenge and egotism"" by Roy Baumeister (""Evil"", 1997). This is probably best understood as an abstract classification: one specific act of violence may have elements of more than just one category.  Anyways, Baumeister argues that violence is a possible effect of self-esteem that doesn't match reality (at least, in the perception of the perpetrator). In other words, people can become violent if they think they deserve better than they are treated, according to Baumeister.  Mass shootings, however, are just one type of violence. Joining a gang, or becoming a criminal is another. Possibly, this is where the distinction comes from:   Young black men in the US (with high self-esteem who are being treated unfairly in their own eyes) have other alternative means to become violent, on average. For instance, by creating or joining gangs. Young white men in the US (with high self-esteem who are being treated unfairly in their own eyes) may be less exposed to other alternative means to become violent, on average. What they do have are examples of other (white) people shooting people.   I'd like to stress that this is just a hypothesis, based on the general case. Digging through some older posts here on /r/socialscience, it seems a reasonable hypothesis:   Some examples of different treatment of black and white perpetrators and victims in the US media. A more structured analysis of school shootings and media descriptions. On the formation of black gangs in Los Angeles.   There are some issues you should be aware of:    One problem for the theory is that self-esteem is a tricky concept. As far as I know, experts have yet to come to a consensus how to measure it. Extreme violence is hard to replicate in the lab, for obvious ethical reasons. Experiments are often about indicators of aggression which is assumed to be a sign of the willingness to become violent.

AskSocialScience,3937e5,mavnorman,3,Tue Jun 9 16:12:20 2015 UTC,"I would combine these two pieces of work to synthesize my theory.  Aronson, Hal. ""Becoming An Environmental Activist: The process of transformation from everyday life into making history in the hazardous waste movement."" Journal of political and military sociology 21.1 (1993): 63-80.  AND   http://www.rolereboot.org/culture-and-politics/details/2012-07-why-most-mass-murderers-are-privileged-white-men  The clickbaity nu-journalism piece has some glaring holes.  It focuses on white, american men, rather than taking any look at statistics relevant to japan or mexico.  Both countries that deal with issues of spree killing.  Further, the lack of entertaining these countervailing data sources highlights a big issue with this sort of research: There is a lensing effect perpetuated by media.  Spree killings are terrible, and it is worse if the spree killer is “one of our own,” as is the case for the narrative crafters associated with corporate media.  That aside, here is one energy analysts guess at why we observe a trend of white men spree killing more often than men of other races.  Entitlement and ownership of space are fundamental qualities that any race studies student would  classify as major components in the concept of “white supremacy”.  If you can get past the volatile name for the concept, this statement really just puts out there this idea: A person who is white, in a white supremacist society, treats the world as if he is a shareholder in it, he has a vested interest in it, and that he has the power and implicit permission to attempt to alter it.    In a society where white supremacy is less of a cultural touchstone, this supremacy idea stratifies in such a way that the dominant populace majority behaves in this fashion.  Think of Japan, with wealthy japanese crafting the country policies to be exclusionary of phillipinos.  Or some parts of the middle east, where religious affiliations generate the pecking order.  With socially sanctioned power comes entitlement.  When you add in gender, for whatever you ascribe the reason, men wind up holding positions of political power and influence and craft the public spaces in such a way to entitle other men to treat the world as if they own it.  One could argue that the reasons that there are so few female serial killers is that 1. we’re socially blind to it so they get away with it better or 2. due to sexism and internalized feelings of powerlessness that society trains many women to have, they don’t end up feeling as if the world is as malleable to their will.    The language being used here comes from radical feminist and race study thought, but the end goal for all people is to feel entitled to use public space as if they own it, free of prejudicial or prescriptive treatment within that space.   Anyway, the major concept to come away from this with is: Entitlement is a concept that is indoctrinated into people who grow up as part of the power majority in a country.  As an entitled person, you expect to have your way, at least eventually.  You resent contrary evidence to the righteousness of your thoughts and actions. Entitlement grants you the confidence that your wisdom has accounted for all the nuance.  Now, to the Aronson article.  This article talks about the the process to transform from an everyday citizen into an environmental activist.  The major step that needs to occur, is that the world needs to demonstrate that it does not give a fuck about what you want.  You need to feel betrayed by the systems around you in order to go through a “reformation.”  These betrayals can be cases of obviously cronyism, bad journalism, slander campaigns that get personal against you, or legal shenanigans to steal your voice.  You need the system to betray you in order for you to solidify and become an agent that is now capable of seeing injustice.  Nothing squashes your confidence like having a rich developer poison your well and get away with it.    My leap of faith here is making the cross comparison between these two subgroups.  But, generally speaking, it will comport with the evidence I’m showing to demonstrate at least some internal consistency.    To become a spree killer, from a standpoint of a person who has no other mental health phenomena occurring, you need to have your surroundings betray you.  This betrayal needs to be personally profound.  For non-whites in america, there is no betrayal process necessary to become an environmental activist: the very nature of systemic racism gives them no such belief in the justice of the system (this is supported in the aronson article and many other anthro-studies of race and environmental activism).  So, back to whitefolk, these entitled men feel betrayed when circumstances in their life align to demonstrate unequivocally that they are not actually entitled to anything whatsoever.  Statistically, they are more likely to experience this per capita (have entitlement), and therefor are more likely to develop a reformation around it.    The reformation can be positive; taking accountability for actions and inactions.  The reformation can be mildly negative; smokes a lot of weed, doesn’t really engage the system.  The reformation can be strongly negative, where the killer convinces themselves that they themselves are worthless, therefor unable to affect society, and then all the blame lands on the “idiots” who don’t see the wisdom of the person, so now they have to pay, starting with the woman who wronged them most recently.    From there, it is a numbers game for why, per capita, there are more white spree killers in the US.  And when you look at the manifestos of these folks, there is a long incubation period.  Sometimes they subscribe to a worldview that just makes things worse for themselves, (Elliot Rodgers, anyone?)  This theory has some neat experimental cues around it.  Does the number of privilege factors affect the likelihood of committing the crime?  Most interestingly, does socio-economic class play a factor.  It is an entitlement cushion, and if it falls away, the reformation is likely to be more potent.  Does anyone have stats for lifetime income level and serial killers per capita therein? And if so, is it statistically normal when you pick it apart by race?  Edit: cleaned up a bit."

AskSocialScience,392rip,mr_crezident,21,Mon Jun 8 20:56:33 2015 UTC,"Economist here. Price is the outcome of market interactions, not something that is given outside of it. So a product won't disappear due to changes in the price, but can disappear due to changes in the market, reflected in the price. The price can become so low that producers exit the market. So basically the causality is not quite what you stipulated and therefore not quite right. Products disappear all the time. Most often due to changes in the production technology of other goods or the introduction of new and better goods. Think about betamax. Betamax didn't disappear because the price was low, but because demand was low. Low demand caused a low equilibrium price and producers exited the market. A good will always be produced as long as at least one firm can cover the cost of producing it.  When it comes to solar panels there is a lot of things going on at the same time. Demand has increased, but production technology has grown even faster. Additionally, it is easier and cheaper to install solar panels now. Solar panels will still be produced but firms that can't produce and cover costs at the current prices will exit and the supply will decrease and prices rise.  There is a good podcast episode about the solar panel market I suggest you check out. http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/04/10/398811199/episode-616-how-solar-got-cheap  Cheers."

If the price is too low there will be a shortage, so the price will go up.  If the price is too high, there will be a surplus, so the price will go down.

AskSocialScience,392rip,issem,2,Tue Jun 9 01:42:27 2015 UTC,"Correct.  Centrally planned economies have two main types:   indicative planning: the Central Planning Board sets prices across the economy directive planning: the Central Planning Board tells every firm how much to produce, using a set number of inputs, in order to supply a set number of goods and services to consumers.   It's not uncommon for market economies to have some central planning, such as price floors and ceilings (e.g. minumum wage, rent control) or production quotas and public entitlements.  A centrally planned economy is an extreme version of that, where every price (indicative planning) or quantity supplied and demanded (directive planning) is determined by the central planning board.  It's unworkable for a number of reasons, but the fact that communist countries even attempted it is a fascinating part of global economic history.  It's also what economists tend to think about when people say the word ""communism.""

AskSocialScience,391wwe,haflac,5,Mon Jun 8 17:33:04 2015 UTC,"I wrote a (history/geography) essay on this topic a while back, specifically in reference to urban apartheid. I'll paraphrase some parts:   In November 1993 the transitional executive committee (TEC) accepted an $850 million loan from the IMF, in secret. It required the agreement of big business, the NP government and the ANC to a secret protocol that restricted the ability to ease monetary policy, increase government expenditure, or change the tax structure, thereby tying the hands of any future government to the requirements of business, specifically monetarist (neoliberal) policy.1 This agreement set the parameters of the role of the state, and the ANC who headed it. State policy was one of reduction and a generally 'hands-off' approach preferencing the growth of business and the assumed universal benefits it would bring. As such the prospects of urban change have to be seen in the context of state submission to (global) capital. In line with the IMF agreement public investment as a share of GDP has, in the post-apartheid era been the same or lower than the last decade of apartheid.2 Of course the targets of state provision radically changed in the post-apartheid era to include blacks on equal terms. Yet the lack of a noticeable increase in state expenditure reflects either the unwillingness of the ANC to face the serious problems facing the conditions of blacks inherited from apartheid, or – more accurately – the transferral of responsibility to solve such problems to businesses, most noticeably through the privatisations initiated by the ANC....between 1995-2000 the average black African household income fell 19 percent, while white household income rose 15 percent, with unemployment doubling over the same period.3  The conflict between the desires of the ANC towards development to satisfy their supporters and make up for apartheid, and the global economy they wish to participate in and it's requirements...  The contradictions of state policy merely reflects a more basic social antagonism of class that has become the overwhelming determinant of urban change, supplanting race.4 This antagonism is reflected in the divisions between rich, generally white, suburbanites living in fortified zones with their concentrations of wealth and deep integration into global capitalist networks. The benefits of which it feels, and fears any holistic state intervention will disrupt. Opposed to a poorer, generally black, urban residents who's experience of global capital is fighting to retain access to basic utilities. Areas far from wealth and to which frustrated and limited state intervention can do little to change given the prevailing context. State policy as supposedly representing national interests expresses this antagonism in it's attempts to both serve the market and those who's suffering has been the sacrifice required by the market (in the forms of budget restraint, wage reductions, privatisations etc.). The reorganisation of the post-apartheid city on class, rather than racial lines, is reflected in a changing urban landscape. Beginning in the closing years of apartheid when many of it's racial controls became unworkable, rich – generally white – residents fled city-centres vulnerable to crime to more prosperous suburbs. With their own informal controls and fortified architecture, this groups seclusion from, and fear of, the poorer urban population reflects the social antagonism between the two played out upon city topology...  The 'de jure' deracialisation of space has expanded opportunities whilst largely ignoring the actual possibility of their achievement. The high inequality of property, social services, employment and wealth prevents this 'de jure' deracialisation of space within the post-apartheid city being translated into “a genuine desegregation of the urban landscape”.5 Hindson et al. has noted how in the closing years of apartheid the break with “territorial apartheid” - especially the collapse of pass controls and the Group Areas Act – powerfully reinforced “residential apartheid and hence the racial geography of the city”.6 This implies the reproduction of the apartheid city wasn't transformed by the end of apartheids overtly coercive measures thus implying a deeper mechanism of social regulation possible transcending the particular apartheid cities characteristics. As such the post-apartheid city is both distinct and similar to it's predecessor; inequality has either stagnated or grown and is still strongly linked to race.7 Yet the globalisation of the city within a framework of racial liberalistion has also transformed the drive of urban policy from one of racial, to directly economic imperatives. The post-apartheid city represents continuity in the seclusion of overwhelming rich white areas from poorer black ones. And change insofar as these groups positions within the cities has changed; no longer is their a clear distinction between a black urban periphery and a white urban centre characteristic of the apartheid city. Nor is race so firmly linked to class.  the very shape of the city both in terms of physical characteristics and symbolic meaning are the outcome of peoples everyday practices in it. Inhabitants of the city do not stand as subjects impotently faced with an objective city already formed by institutional actors. The mass of subjects within the city are not 'victims' but interact, change and often challenge the received urban landscape, it's structures of power and patterns of reproduction. The permanency of grassroots community movements from apartheid perhaps signifies the continuity of symptoms such movements were formed to fight.  All these community groups, 'defensive' or 'offensive' transform and challenge the city they 'receive' by challenging not only the submissive role required of their communities, but actively shaping the socio-cultural life of the city and their communities through the maintenance of it's semi-autonomous character ensuring their vibrant particularity. The reclaiming of land for public use by these groups is an attempt to make real the national discourse of a 'nation for everyone' all with a place to live within it. This vibrant network with it's links to other forms of community power, represents a fragmented but real 'on the ground' attempt to make the city truly post-apartheid, to challenge conditions of existence in the cities which for many have remained unchanged. Even if Freund's criticism perhaps remain overwhelmingly true, since the 2000's there's been a steady challenge, if not to the monopoly of the ANC over elected districts, but to the facade of ANC respectability inherited from it's historic role in the anti-apartheid struggle. Community activity, in it's myriad of forms, poses a direct challenge to the authority of government and businesses to control the city. If the continuing declining voter turnout represents a regression of public discourse in the face of perceived ANC impotence and corruption, then this community activity attempts to be it's positive corollary by not only voicing easily ignored concerns, but actively shaping the city in it's image.  Though Murray is correct in noting “market competition is the principal mechanism governing the regulation and organisation of urban space”8, this rule goes by no means unchallenged by the networks of community groups or the contradictory policies of state intervention. Today the post-apartheid city remains still defined in relation to it's oppressive forebear insofar as it's organisation is still ultimately serving the same interests for which the apartheid regime was originally constructed; capitalism. However this hegemony is challenged by a variety of sincere local officials and community activities who wish to translate the post-apartheid city from something which doesn't merely stand after apartheid, but opposed to it. Overall at present the differences are at once vast  - insofar as black life is no longer characterised by regular formal oppression from the state – and unobservable – insofar as the main demographics of black urban life remaining largely unchanged. The South African city today also exemplifies a topographical change in it's organisation of urban space and demographic distribution, which more broadly reflects an official policy tying cities directly into the requirements of international capital, which no longer mediated through racial distinctions and the success the ANC's BEE policy has produced a city defined by largely by class.   1 M.

Discourse theory may be of particular relevance to what you're looking at. I have no knowledge of linguistics but it may be useful to explore it.  Torfing, J, New Theories of Discourse, (Blackwell, 1998)   Hunt, A & Purvis, T, ‘Discourse, Ideology, Discourse, Ideology, Discourse, Ideology...’, British Journal of Sociology 44 (3), 1993  Rosenau, P, Postmodernism and the Social Sciences (Princeton University Press, 1992)  Fred R. Shapiro (American Speech, Vol. 60, No. 1 [Spring 1985]): Historical Notes on the Vocabulary of the Women’s Movement, pp. 3-16.  I summarise with a very broad brush here but terms such as racism and sexism evolve and change in meaning as society also evolves and changes, and the barrier that face those affected by racism and sexism also change. For example sexism used to refer to 'belief that one sex is superior to the other', as the main barriers to women's liberation were ideas that women were mentally weaker and not biologically able to perform many tasks in the public sphere.  You used the example that racism and sexism used to refer to ""harmful laws"". Discriminatory legislation was often a barrier to liberation movements and thus racism and sexism was often used to refer to these laws. While in many places these legal barriers have been removed, yet racism and sexism still exist. Thus, subsequently a modern barrier to women's liberation now is the argument that 'men and women have equal opportunities in today's world, so people trying to end sexism are actually hurting men'. This means that the context of sexism is manifested in a way that no longer fits it's original definition.  TLDR: The terms racism/sexism change along with the context of racism/sexism, and the barriers faced by those subject to racism/sexism.     Men faster runners than women on average? That's sexism!"", ""Genetic race differences require different medicine? Stop it, science on race differences is racist science!""   The examples you use above may be symptomatic of two things:   It may be an attempt to discredit scientific racism, scientific sexism, or social darwinism. These were often used to ""scientifically"" prove that certain races, genders, or sexes were inferior to each other. While it is not racist or sexist to talk about race or sex, examples of differences are often cherry picked and used carelessly to justify or reinforce a sexist or racist point. These examples may be an overreaction to this. It may be an example of extreme 'one-worldism' or moral universalism in which differences between humans are minimised and any attempt to be acknowledge difference is regarded as divisive."

AskSocialScience,390p2q,silverionmox,-2,Mon Jun 8 22:29:12 2015 UTC,"You have to define efficiency properly: efficiency of spending money (that is clear) to achieve what? GDP growth? Or something else?  If it's GDP growth you're concerned with, then government spending often has a positive multiplier, for example when focused on supporting low incomes or infrastructure investments that benefit the whole economy. For example, concerning the Greek crisis Blanchard and Leigh deduced that IMF forecasters have been using a uniform multiplier of 0.5, when in fact the circumstances of the European economy made the multiplier as much as 1.5, meaning that a $1 government spending cut would cost $1.50 in lost output. Never forget to account for differences in place, time and situation rather than assuming a given multiplier is always true."
AskSocialScience,390p2q,silverionmox,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:24:45 2015 UTC,"A previous article they mention puts it at 3% rather than 30%.  It's only the income tax they evaluated. Taxes on pollution would not create a deadweight loss, but the reverse: a gain by discouraging actions with negative externalities.  They also don't account for the fact that a lot of government spending is used to create conditions that allow a functioning market at all.  Deadweight loss only accounts for the loss caused by the taxation: it assumes the tax is just an extra cost and that the money is used to build pyramids or something. In reality tax money is spent still. Deadweight loss applies to specific products. People who would have bought something anyway don't burn that money instead, but buy other things with it. So the concept has its limits, and I don't think it's the right answer to the OP's question, which was: ""if I pay $1 in tax, how much does the government receive after direct costs"".  For that you could simply subtract the costs of running the taxation services from the total amount of taxes to get a rough idea. A more thorough approach would account for the use the tax services make of enforcement and conflict resolution services of the government, the administrative burdens imposed on the citizenry, and the usefulness of the tax service data for general policy, research or the performance of other services; finally taxes also are a policy instrument and eg. a tax on pollution would have positive externalities by discouraging pollution."

This will put negative pressure on real interest rates   Says who?   People will consume less, and put more money into savings since saved income will not be taxed.   Might they not save less if effective prices increase proportionally more than the fall in quantity (so that total expenditure in dollars increases)? Also, who said anything about saved income not being taxed?   The government has increased its revenues, so it does not need to accumulate as much debt to finance its expenditures. Investors will reallocate funds elsewhere, thus increasing the supply of capital stock.   How does the claim in the second sentence follow from the first?  You have some creative ideas, and it's always good to challenge conventional wisdom with possible alternatives (even if those alternatives don't turn out to be better). However, in this particular case you've made a number of important logical leaps. If you want to convince someone--including, most importantly, yourself--that this idea is a good one, you need to fill in those logical gaps. I think you'll find, though, that filling those gaps in this case probably won't be possible. I've been wrong before, though.

AskSocialScience,390wyw,CornerSolution,-1,Mon Jun 8 18:16:43 2015 UTC,"Alright so maybe I wasn't very clear when I originally wrote this.   Says who?   Which part? Inflation will happen because the price of everything will go up. Are you asking why inflation puts negative pressure on real interest rates? I mean, real interest by definition = nominal interest - rate of inflation. I'm not really sure what you're asking.   Might they not save less if effective prices increase proportionally more than the fall in quantity?    Okay now this seems a bit odd. In no situation will a tax increase total expenditures. Even if demand is extremely inelastic, the net expenditures still go down, albeit not very much. But more importantly, just think about it in terms of marginal penalties. C. Alan Garner probably explains it better than I can:   Under a consumption tax, households are likely to save more in the present because a consumption tax does not penalize savers. The present value of the consumption tax—the value of current and future tax payments discounted to the present—is the same, whether the household consumes now or later   The way I think about it is that savings and consumption are essentially substitutes. So if the costs of one goes up, the demand for the other will also go up.   How does the claim in the second sentence follow from the first?   Investors that would have invested in treasury securities would not be able to purchase as many from the government because it doesn't need as much money now that there is a budget surplus. Effectively, this is the opposite of the crowding out effect.   why would you trade a policy instrument that does that directly for one that might...---in a roundabout way and with significant unpredictability---at best accomplish the same thing, and at worst accomplish the opposite?    I mean that's kind of the point of the question. Any government policy has costs and benefits and its important to analyze them. I don't think that this system is really all that different. Both my proposal and current monetary policy work through the same mechanism: open market operations. The FED does not ""directly"" influence interest rates, it has to buy bonds (such as T-securities) on the open market. The only difference is where the money ultimately comes from. The FED merely prints new money or takes money out of reserves. It's not anymore ""roundabout or unpredictable"" than OMO conducted by the FED. To me, it seems a lot more efficient to use a consumption tax rather than simply printing more money, because overall it will contribute to more long run growth."
AskSocialScience,390wyw,CornerSolution,2,Mon Jun 8 19:18:47 2015 UTC,"Are you asking why inflation puts negative pressure on real interest rates?   Yes.   I mean, real interest by definition = nominal interest - rate of inflation.    You seem to be assuming that the nominal interest rate wouldn't also simultaneously change. On what basis?   Okay now this seems a bit odd. In no situation will a tax increase total expenditures. Even if demand is extremely inelastic, the net expenditures still go down, albeit not very much.   No, that is incorrect. Let's take a very simple example. Suppose household demand is given by D = a - bP, where P is the price. Total expenditure is then  E = PD = aP - bP2  We then have dE/dP = a - 2bP, which is negative if 2bP > a. Since a consumption tax is effectively an increase in P (from the consumer's perspective), we see that it is possible for a tax increase to result in an overall increase in household expenditure. This is obviously a very simple, partial-equilibrium example, but the same principle applies more generally.   C. Alan Garner probably explains it better than I can   I managed to track down the source of that quote. The context there is very important: he's comparing consumption taxes to income taxes. So he's arguing that if you replace an income tax with a consumption tax, saving will increase. This is not because consumption taxes increase savings, though, but because income taxes penalize savings. So this is very different from arguing that, holding income taxes constant, increasing consumption taxes would increase savings, which is the argument you seem to be trying to make.   It's not anymore ""roundabout or unpredictable"" than OMO conducted by the FED.   It absolutely is more roundabout and unpredictable. The interest rate is set in centralized markets made up of very well-informed and sophisticated agents, and adjusts nearly instantaneously and predictably to actual and anticipated changes in Fed policies. In contrast, the mechanism you're proposing (which, again, I'm dubious about in the first place) operates through household consumption decisions, which we know empirically are very sticky, and aren't terribly well understood beyond that.  Let me bring up another point, though. Typically, the whole purpose of the Fed lowering interest rates is to stimulate a sagging economy by encouraging purchases of new goods. In contrast, the immediate effect of the policy you propose would be to reduce purchases of new goods by making them more expensive. Isn't this entirely counterproductive?"
AskSocialScience,390wyw,KserDnB,0,Mon Jun 8 19:54:07 2015 UTC,"No, that is incorrect. Let's take a very simple example. Suppose household demand is given by D = a - bP, where P is the price.    Alright, it seems that you are conflating the demand curve with the supply curve. P is specifically the amount people are willing to pay for the marginal change in quantity, ie its the slope of the demand curve. I'm not even sure how the government can change the slope of the demand curve (maybe some kind of price discrimination?). A consumption tax does not change the utility that people get out of a good. It can only increase the cost of that good. Which means you need to look at the supply curve, because the supply curve is all about costs. Suppose the aggregate supply of all goods and services is given by S = a +bP, where a is the initial per-unit costs of those goods. A consumption tax would increase a, shifting the supply curve upward. There is no way that total expenditures increase.    this is very different from arguing that, holding income taxes constant, increasing consumption taxes would increase savings, which is the argument you seem to be trying to make.   Its really not that different. Lets say before the consumption tax,  Uc/MCc = the marginal utility of consumption per marginal cost of consumption. Us/MCs = the marginal utility of savings per marginal cost of savings. In order to maximize utility, you allocate your total income to both consumption and savings such that Uc/MCc = Us/MCs. Now, lets say that a consumption tax is levied, keeping all else equal. MCs does not change. MCc increases however, which decrease the marginal utility per cost of consumption. This means you need to allocate a greater proportion of your income to savings.    The interest rate is set in centralized markets made up of very well-informed and sophisticated agents, and adjusts nearly instantaneously and predictably to actual and anticipated changes in Fed policies.   Yes. Thats what i was referring to when i said ""open market operations"".    In contrast, the mechanism you're proposing (which, again, I'm dubious about in the first place) operates through household consumption decisions.   No, thats not the mechanism I'm proposing... The mechanism is still that centralized market of very well-informed and sophisticated agents. I am suggesting that it would be more efficient for the government to engage in open market operations via deficit reduction rather than monetary policy. The FED gets money by creating it. I'm suggesting that OMO be funded by real funds generated by tax revenue rather than simply creating new money. New money is a tax on everything in the exact same way, expect maybe a lot less efficient because at least consumption taxes internalize negative externalities such as carbon emissions."

P is specifically the amount people are willing to pay for the marginal change in quantity, ie its the slope of the demand curve.   No, I'm sorry, that's not right. The slope of the demand curve is not the price. The slope of the demand curve (as it's usually found in a typical supply-and-demand diagram) is, by definition, the rate at which price changes as demand changes. In the example from my previous post, the slope of the demand curve would be -1/b, which does not even depend on P.   A consumption tax does not change the utility that people get out of a good. It can only increase the cost of that good.   That's exactly the point. It increases the cost of the good, which increases the price of the good. As a result, if the quantity of goods purchased doesn't fall very much for a given rise in the price, then total expenditure will actually increase. To convince yourself of this, take the extreme case where demand is perfectly inelastic (vertical demand curve), so that quantity doesn't change. The price has gone up, which means that total expenditure has to have increased.   Lets say before the consumption tax, Uc/MCc = the marginal utility of consumption per marginal cost of consumption. Us/MCs = the marginal utility of savings per marginal cost of savings....   I'm sorry, but I don't follow this example at all.   No, thats not the mechanism I'm proposing...The mechanism is still that centralized market of very well-informed and sophisticated agents.   How so? You're talking about consumption taxes, which would be on goods in millions and millions of retail outlets, both physical and electronic. That is the very definition of de-centralized markets. In order to have an effect, these taxes would have to influence household consumption decisions as I stated. Further, buyers in these markets (and many of the sellers, too) are typically far from sophisticated.  Truthfully, it seems to me that you're fundamentally misunderstanding some of the basics of economics, though I can't put my finger on what exactly (FWIW, I have a doctorate in the subject, so with all due respect, I'm fairly certain it's you not me that's missing something).

It is important to remember that gender roles is something that every epistemology has a contribution to make to the field, whether it be psychology, cultural studies or anthropology.

I would argue the latter has the stronger position though there is certainty a biological aspect at play. I would also make the assumption gender roles are culturally and historically contingent.  You wish to know examples of cross cultural differences of gender roles. Similarities are common but it is certainly not universal.

Although with questionable reliability Margaret Mead's study of 3 New Guinean tribes is a historically famous study on this. Berry (2002) also looked at cross cultural gender differences (a good example of imposed etic in research though). Whiting and Edwards (1975?). It has been suggested gender roles differ within a culture as well as cross culturally; Tager and Good (2005) looked at different ideas of masculinity amongst N and S Italians in the US.

This gives them some control over housing and how it affects the general economy (e.g. Land developers putting money into the economy, cost to government of providing services, not putting a glut on the housing market so it doesn't crash).

Australia, New Zealand, and the UK all have social housing schemes in which the government builds cheap houses for poor people who otherwise couldn't afford to buy one. And because purchase prices are high, owners have to charge high rent to pay their mortgages, so poor people can't afford private rentals either, but they can afford the cheap government rent.

AskSocialScience,38tj0t,A0220R,1 point,Sun Jun 7 08:29:34 2015 UTC,"From a clinical perspective, the old DSM-IV-TR had two categories for substance use disorders. One was substance abuse, and the other was substance dependence. The general thinking was that substance abuse was precursor to substance dependence, and so both could be considered lesser and greater degrees of alcoholism.  The new DSM-V combined them into one disorder, [substance use disorder](www.buppractice.com/node/4621], covering a continuum of diagnostic criteria.   But a more informal way of thinking about it is that abuse is the heavy use of a substance, whereas addiction is characterized by some degree of physical or psychological dependency (though neurologists will tell you that addiction and dependency engage different areas of the brain, somewhat complicating the picture) and tolerance.   Whereas, if you binge drink (like every good college student should) or generally drink heavily, you're abusing alcohol. But most people (about 90%) who binge drink or drink excessively aren't alcoholics.   tl;dr - Alcoholism is a vague label generally referring to ""problem drinking"". Clinically, it included abuse and dependence, but that has been replaced by ""substance use disorder"". Other recent research has sought to separate the two, primarily because of evidence that many people engage in excessive drinking that could be considered 'abuse' without ever developing the sort of problems, tolerance, and dependence that we typically think of as alcoholism."

But the cars will just sit there if they are not sold, someone has to make those arrangements. Surely that counts as part of the production process.  Same for the clerks, who make sure resources reach correct destinations on time. Or the purchasing manager, who makes the resources available in the first place. It's bizarre to assert they're not necessary labour. If they're not, neither is the accountant who makes sure factory workers get paid, or the on-site doctor who saves their limbs, or the union leader in charge of OH&S.   Then there's the capital provided by shareholders, without which the factory workers would not be able to produce even a fraction of their output. I'm partial to the goals of workplace democracy, and want to see the division of the economic pie get a lot better and fairer, but let's be straight - when talking about sharing, let's add up all the factors first. Without the factory and the tools and the materials, the workers could not make the cars. Shareholders indirectly provide all those necessary things. So they are part of the production process too.   Going up another level of abstraction, and one can easily say that taxes pay for many things, including things the company relies on to exist and build and sell cars in the first place. Infrastructure of all kinds, contract enforcement and property protection, market regulation, basic research, legal benefits like limited liability and patents, an educated worker pool, firefighters, etc. Obama was right when he said:   If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you’ve got a business — you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn’t get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet.  The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together.   Lastly, Wolff was simply incorrect when he said ""1% of shareholders own 75% of the shares"". Institutional investors, like pension funds representing hundreds of thousands of people (including factory workers), are majority owners of shares according to this article originally from the New York Law Journal:   as of 2009, the average institutional shareholder equity ownership at the top 1,000 U.S. corporations was approximately 73 percent"

You want to complain that Marxian economic analysis doesn't consider these types of roles 'productive' when you wish to at the same time ignore exactly what's being produced within that distinction. Does finance produce surplus value? No. It axiomatically can't in terms of the theory we're talking about. That is not the same thing as saying it's not 'useful' or 'doesn't do anything' in terms of capital. It obviously does. Which Marx spends several thousand pages outlining in detail.

The car has a socially-necessary labor time but it can't realize or express that value because it is of no use to anybody, so that SNLT doesn't act as ""value"". That is, something can't act as a value and can't express an exchange-value if it doesn't have a use-value (utility). He discusses it in the first chapter of Kapital:   A thing can be a use value, without having value. This is the case whenever its utility to man is not due to labour. Such are air, virgin soil, natural meadows, &c. A thing can be useful, and the product of human labour, without being a commodity. Whoever directly satisfies his wants with the produce of his own labour, creates, indeed, use values, but not commodities. In order to produce the latter, he must not only produce use values, but use values for others, social use values. [...]  Lastly nothing can have value, without being an object of utility. If the thing is useless, so is the labour contained in it; the labour does not count as labour, and therefore creates no value.   Notice that Marx makes a distinction between ""value"" and ""price"", and his theory of value is not a theory of price determination. ""Value"" is a measure of a commodities general exchangeability, or it's ""natural"" exchange ratio so to speak. ""Price"" is whatever is it's exchange-value at any specific point in time, and it varies according to supply and demand in order to co-ordinate and distribute social labor through the economy. Prices work by diverging from Values, but they do so in a systematic rather than erratic way.   If it's the latter, then aren't the people who help ensure that people are producing cars that people want, or alternatively ensuring that people want the cars that have been produced, part of the process of producing that value?   ""Value"" is not a normative category nor does it refer to ""productivity"" or ""usefulness"" in general, it is a very technical term. Managers are part of the value-producing process because they oversee the people who are producing value, but they do not directly produce the value themselves. Finance is ""useful"" in the sense that modern Capitalism would be unworkable with out modern finance, but finance does not technically produce new ""value"", it just moves the surplus-value produced elsewhere around.   So managers and the like are ""part of the process"" but Marx's analysis of surplus-value is a technical analysis of where this value directly comes from or which variables are directly responsible for the existance of surplus-value (namely, the wage of labour-power and the definite amount of value created by the labour-power) and not of every single detail involved in the process. For a comparison: In Marxist theories a janitor is also not a producer of surplus-value, but only a very vulgar interpretation of Marxism would say janitors are ""unproductive"" or ""useless"", they are only ""unproductive"" of surplus-value but surplus-value is not the only thing that matters when organising an economy."

AskSocialScience,38qi47,The_Old_Gentleman,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:14:56 2015 UTC,"So then what precisely is the socialist critique of the managerial class?   well there's arguable no Marxists critique of the 'managerial class' insofar as Marxism is a critique of what that class manages (capital and it's valorisation via labour-power). As such it stands as an analysis of and in opposition to the content of capitalism, and not just the particular form through which that content is mediated. Hence Marx doesn't want a capitalism without capitalists. Doesn't want workers owned businesses. The essence of capitalism is the commodity-form, value, capital, private property, the state, the market, money, division of labour etc. and not simply 'the capitalist' or the individual owners or managers of labour. It seems a misunderstanding of this is why confusion has arisen.   The very problem that is being identified expresses Marx's theory more clearly, and clarifies a mistake made to often by Marxists themselves, that is the fetish of the wage-relation. Capitalism is not simply the class relation dividing those who use and own a given means of production, if it was and that capitalism was the one being criticised, then the above points about managers contributing to value-production would be correct. Making a fetish of class is was ends many socialists insofar as they can never get beyond (the working)class (i.e. to communism). A 'manager' after all is still an employee, and increasingly in the casualised service sector and immaterial labour 'workers' are increasingly there own managers or the managers of others (as the workplace is divided). Even though class is a concrete structural relation increasingly changes in production gives it a movement and certain ambiguity. This is a problem for those socialists who've always defined communism as essentially anti-capitalist as against managers, bosses and capitalists as capitalism (instead of as mere mediators of the value-form that dominates society as a whole). Marx didn't make this mistake. Unlike some socialists he doesn't want labour to receive the value it creates back for the very reason that value is only expressed in an exchange relation with other commodities. And because 'value' is a social aggregate and cannot be parcelled out to different sections of the production process. It's simply impossible to dole out 'value' back to workers for 'their share'. Those who think it is are invariable the ones who make this class fetish. The desire for a more equitable distribution of 'value' rather than it's abolition (as it's a defining feature of capitalism) means these 'socialists' must define themselves against capitalists while leaving capitalism relatively unharmed. Those who place so much of both the essence and the determination of capitalism upon the class relation end up in problems when faced by say the rise of workers management, or by the proliferation of low-level management in the service industry who's 'means of production' and relations to it aren't as definite as industrial production and thus the population of a class less definite.   to conclude a critique of the managerial class is as idealist as a critique of the state. Those who merely want a class for themselves want to essentially retain the proletariat without the capitalists, a class relation without an antagonism. Such a position is a contradiction. Against capitalists, bosses and managers is not synonymous with being against capitalism. This view is one from bourgeois economics which sees capitalism as merely a collection of capitalists, with therefore makes capitalism reducible to the individual actions of a given capitalist. This 'class fetish' discussed requires a fixation on the binary of capitalist-worker etc. and correlation of each with productive or unproductive functions. The desire to retain the workers is the desire to retain production but with the workers work now supposedly controlled and owned by themselves. Hence these people must make the case for the un-productivity of the 'managerial class' to be replaced with the equal distribution of value (from which the managers/capitalists had merely appropriated). This muddled brand of socialism is the most commonplace, it's simplicity hides it's incoherence."

I think i explained it in unclear terms because i first misunderstood your point.  No, the ""mental work"" involved in chosing which commodity to make and administering it's production can be part of the socially-necessary labor time that was required to make it, and hence, adds to it's ""value"". When you buy a commodity, all the labour that was socially necessary in order to have it in the place you bought it is part of it's value. Though i don't think the sales manager example used by Wolff fit that bill.  While a lot of the work performed by managers and administrators is part of the value of commodities, much of the work also performed by them is not socially necessary and is ""managing exploitation"" or ""managing realization"" instead: Finding ways to raise the rate of surplus-value or lower the SNLT of commodities. This work is not part of the mental work that is socially necessary to have the commodity finished. Sales managers on the other hand are not performing SNLT to have the commodity made, but their job is to have the value already produced sucessfully ""realized"".  The thing is that the function of ""manager"" and ""capitalist"" are not the same (and in my original reply i assumed you were conflating the two). The function of ""capitalist"" is to advance money to buy labour-power and means of production and obtain more money from them. A ""capitalist"" does not need to identify products or allocate workers in order to be a ""capitalist"" or perform any mental labour that is socially necessary to have the commodity made, his income comes from his ownership of the property involved. A capitalist may also perform labor as an administrator, but this doesn't make him any less of a capitalist, since the bulk of his income comes from his activity as a capitalist and not from his administrative work. The role of capitalist does not add any value."

Only it doesn't remain the same. As you've said, the value becomes zero if no one wants it. An item doesn't have intrinsic value - at least not in any modern definition that I'm aware of - it only has value if someone wants it, and in terms of sold goods, the size of that value is linked to the amount of money that the person is prepared to pay for it.  Not necessarily the amount of money they they do pay for it though - the price could be below what they value it at, or they may realise after buying it that is' not as valuable to them as they thought it would be, so I agree that price and value are two separate things.  And if a product could potentially have value to someone, but they aren't aware of its existence, or of its capabilities, then that value can't be realised. And that's where a good salesman comes in - making the person aware of its value to them.  If Marx is claiming that, as your linked article, ""It takes the form of commodities with definite values. "", then it seems to me that he's using value in a different way to how I suspect most people in the modern world would see it. Why would a car, or anything else, have any intrinsic value if no one wants it, just because people have put effort into making it? Who is this car valuable to? And why?"

Over it's average lifespan, constant capital adds it's own socially necessary labour time to the commodities it makes, but no more than that, so it can't act as a source of surplus-value. What capital changes is that it's presence allows laborers to produce value or not, but it doesn't change the magnitude of the value created.  Also, there is a difference between saying ""capital"" is productive and saying ""capitalists"" or ""capitalism"" (""capitalism"" being the act of advancing capital) is productive. Having the ability to ""provide"" capital is not productive, if workers simply took the capital with out the need of a capitalist to ""provide"" it the same amount of value would have been created anyway."

Prerequisites of production should not be confused with production itself. Purchasing labour-power and getting means of production is all necessary to produce value. Capital is dead labour, an accumulation of the successes of previous production cycles. Capital is that which multiples itself through the wage-relation and the activity of the worker. It's the workers who produce capital. Capitalist merely determine were to utilise best said capital.

And does a similar parcel of value belong to all other prerequisites of value production? Planting a plant that bears fruit, does that mean I created the fruit? The origin of the tomato is the plant, not the farmer. That doesn't make them irrelevant. It's merely the result of a precise and technical analysis of value as an aggregate of social labour. This kind of analysis is borrowed from science. For indeed science says the tomato comes from the tomato plant and not the farmer. That doesn't reduce the farmer to an irrelevance since their action can radically transform the rate at which tomatoes are produced. Your criticism tends towards pedanticism.

You can reach back too the dawn of human civilisations and state the invention of the wheel to be the real origin of value or wealth or whatever. A never-ending post hoc ergo propter hoc. The fact that science cannot point to a precise point or formation that makes something a baby or not, or a human or not, does not mean said baby or human doesn't exist. Similarly Marxists cannot tell you precisely when value is created or when capitalism first emerged, doesn't mean the analysis is irrelevant or wrong anymore than the inability of science to define 'human' means humans don't exist.   A holistic historic analysis would be one which traces the transformation of value over time. The means and forms through which it accumulated and reproduced.

Here's a paper by a relevant economist discussing the empirical strenght of Marxist theories. Marxist economics and Mainstream economists are two different research paradigms with different sociological assumptions over what capitalism is, different methodology, different research goals (Marxists seek to look at the essential ways capitalism works, Mainstream wants to locate relationships between certain variables to come up with better policy-making tools), etc. I strongly doubt you could cite five relevant empirical predictions of Marxist theories and which mainstream papers proved them to be sooooo utterly discredited.    Marx considered shareholder returns to be ""surplus value"" that was ""stolen"" from the laborers.   You do know that Marx never made that case at all, right? Oh wait, that would require actually reading his work.   But every business student in America today understands that without return on investment, there is no investment, and therefore no business.   Holy commodity fetishism, Sherlock.   What you said is an obvious tautology. ""There is no capitalist society with out capital"". Yes, and? Marx is interested in understanding how Capital works. His argument in Kapital vol. 1 is that the aggregate economic value that constitutes the aggregate amount of surplus-value in the economy can only have it's origin in an unpaid expenditure of labour-power, that is, in order for there to be a return in any investment then the average price of labour-power must be systematically lower than the aggregate value created by that expenditure of labour-power. There is no normative judgement or ethical analysis of this relationship in this thesis in Das Kapital, it's just a descriptive statement of where the return on Capital comes from.  Saying that surplus-value is ""justified"" in a Capitalist society (and Karl Marx is not interested in having that discussion, but you seem to be so let's have it) because you can't have an investment with out surplus-value is like saying that the existance of a monarch is justified because you can't have a working monarchy with out a monarch. It's a true statement, but it doesn't justify the monarchy itself, and hence lends no strenght to the argument. That is so because the way ""investment"" happens in a Capitalist economy is determined by the social structure of the Capitalist economy: In a society of private property, commodity production and generalized wage-labor, of course that an investment will require a return on investment, because in this society you need to obtain Capital (i.e self-expanding value) on order to maintain your business, you can't survive with out surplus-value.   An alternative social system where property is handled differently, products are not made to be commodities and and labour is not wage-labour, investment and production would be handled differently and the social-surplus would not take the form of surplus-value. So in order to find a ""justification"" for this relationship in you need an analysis of how Capitalist society works and how does it fare when compared to an alternative social system that works differently (much like, in order to find a ""justification"" for a political system you need an analysis of how it works and how does it fare when compared to other political systems, such as Republic vs. Monarchy and etc).  By taking Capitalist investment as a given, you are assuming that Capitalism is a natural social relationship that is eternal or an expression of the laws of nature, and not a social system that arose under a specific historical, economic, political and cultural conditions and has it's own inner logic. This is an unwarranted and quite blatantly false assumption. When the old bearded German man was going   “Economists have a singular method of procedure. There are only two kinds of institutions for them, artificial and natural. The institutions of feudalism are artificial institutions, those of the bourgeoisie are natural institutions. In this, they resemble the theologians, who likewise establish two kinds of religion. Every religion which is not theirs is an invention of men, while their own is an emanation from God. When the economists say the present-day relations--the relations of bourgeois production--are natural, they imply that these are the relations in which wealth is created and productive forces developed in conformity with the laws of nature. These relations therefore are themselves natural laws independent of the influence of time. They are eternal laws which must always govern society. Thus, there has been history, but there is no longer any. There has been history, since there were institutions of feudalism, and in these institutions of feudalism we find quite different relations of production from those of bourgeois society, which the economists try to pass off as natural and, as such, eternal.”    in Poverty of Philosophy he kind of had a point.   I fail to see why it is so damn hard for the raging leftists on Reddit to simply admit: Marx was wrong.

Marx was the greatest critic of these idealistic, pre-figurative politics you think he also engaged in. Capitalism lead to the greatest wealth production when compared to previous modes of production? Why yes, Marx himself made that point in every single one of his works. But like all contradictory modes of production, there is a point where the forces of production outpace it's limits and it breaks down. The capitalist mode of production isn't a final ""plan"" that is ""chosen"" to be the endgame for humanity, it is a thing that exists in a specific historical framework and has inner tendencies that can develop into different directions. Capitalism may seem all fine and dandy right now but it'll be difficult to keep around once the historical framework changed and the rate of profit is too low to go on at all.    If we are judging economic systems empirically by results only, Marx is most certainly ""wrong"" and Capitalism is at least some shade of ""right"".   Marx didn't ""propose"" anything!

FDI didn't happen due to the nature and rules of ownership in these countries,  military investment from the west, or previous industrialization under Japanese rule.  We will start with Japan. In the late 19th and early 20th century Japan was rapidly modernizing. This is called the Meiji Restoration. Japan used government money, foreign investment, and financing to build industries like, smelting, ship yard, spinning, and modern sericulture. Thanks to cheap Japanese labor these  industries were able to export a great quantity of materials for very cheap. This resulted in the importation of western technologies to help increase productivity and also resulted in a lot of foreign investment. This is how Japan rapidly industrialized. At the same time they were shopping for military technology and with many European countries weary of Russia they were able to get training and financial backing to support their attempts against Russia in the east.  Yamamura, Kozo. ""Success Illgotten? The Role of Meiji Militarism in Japan's Technological Progress."" The Journal of Economic History (1977)  At the same time China was getting a lot of foreign investors as well as a lot of foreign meddling. Every nation and their counter parts seemed to want a hand in China. Even Japan was getting in on it. However, due to the sheer scale of China and the lack of a strong central government at this point these investments didn't go anywhere. Eventually China descended into civil war. During this time Japan started to reach into China more and more. After a long bloody civil war, a cease fire (sort of) happened when Japan invaded in 1931, but really held together after 1937 when Japan invaded the core provinces of China. During WWII China got a lot of help in aid and technology from the Allies in particular the U.S. who wanted to bog down the Japanese in mainland China. Post WWII the civil war started again. Eventually Nationalist and Chiang Kai-Shek retreated to Taiwan.  In doing this they brought the treasury with them. Taking the coffers China had carried since democratization first happened in the teens. The island they retreated too had been under Japanese control from 1895-1945. The Japanese had made lots of investments in Taiwan and had really built up the island. Investments in crops, railroads, banking, and education had been made over the past 50 years. With the industrialization from Japan, the treasury from the KMT, and significant American investments from 1949 onward Taiwan was able to rapidly industrialize.  Tierney, Robert. ""Tropics of Savagery: The Culture of Japanese Empire in Comparative Frame."" (2010).  Korea is similar to Taiwan. From 1910-1945 Korea was a colony of Japan. Japan spent a lot of time and money in Korea building up railroads, building factories, educating students, etc. on the Korean peninsula. This was to help resource poor Japan have more food and minerals for its industry. Post WWII Japan paid out a lot of war reparations to Korea especially under the Park Chung-hee administration. Normalizing relations with Japan came at the cost of sharing and helping Korea build up ship manufacturing in Ulsan, smelting in Pohang, and some general technology upgrades country wide. At the same time the U.S. was pouring in a lot of military aid, financial aid, and development aid, to help prevent communism from spreading. That aid allowed the Park administration to focus on building up the country.  Cumings, Bruce. ""Korea's Place in the Sun: a Modern History."" (2005)  Unfortunately this explanation is very simplified. There is a lot I glossed over. Japans foreign investments into Korea and Taiwan, Japan's window guidance system and foreign investments. The Korean war and rebuilding. Taiwan's position on the UN Security Council until 1971.  Korea's Chaebol system of investment and modernization and the focus on export economies.  I would say that foreign investment had a significant, but not a solely important role in these economic miracles. FDI didn't happen mostly because the governments in these three countries had a centralized power structure either in Zaibatsu/Financial Authority, Chaebols, or in Taiwan's case just KMT control. It is also to note that all three of these countries were ""Democratic"" during their rise, but usually had a defacto or actual dictator in charge."

AskSocialScience,38np1z,Ikhtilaf,24,Fri Jun 5 11:52:20 2015 UTC,"Let's talk a bit about coups, which certainly have a tendency to lead to military rule. In his book on coups, Luttwack writes about conditions in which this is possible. One such condition is a poor standard of living, characterized by low literacy rates and minimal government services. This creates a 'distance' between the normal citizen and politics.   ""Thus, after a coup, the village policeman comes to read out a proclamation, the radio says that the old government was corrupt and that the new one will provide food, health, schooling - and sometimes even glory. The majority of the people will neither believe or disbelieve these promises or accusations, but merely feel that it is all happening somewhere else, far away.""  One humorous illustration discusses the African prefex Wa-. The Wa- prefix indicates a tribe, such as ""WaKamba."" The 'foreigners' in charge of the government were jokingly titled ""WaRollsRoyce.""  Now this does not help us explain coups in locations that have their social act together, more or less. But one consistent factor is opacity in government. The people of Egypt might enjoy a relatively high literacy rate (74%, more or less), but their politics have traditionally been very opaque. When a politician is purged, that's an 'over there' problem.  Now despite all the talk of a a politically apathetic population, Westerners are very aware of their politics, or at least the rules they think should govern it. If a general seized the parliament of the UK, the population would not likely give him their complacency. I recommend you make a post in /r/askhistorians inquiring about either the military coup attempt in France, 1961 or the seizing of the Spanish parliament in 1981.

I kind of asking about the latter.    If a general seized the parliament of the UK, the population would not likely give him their complacency.   This is what I'm curious of, actually. Why don't the people of UK - or any other European countries - let the army takeover? If it's about government transparency, what about Thailand, whose people are quite literate and ranks quite well in Transparency index, but place a lot trust in their military to handle civilian affair?

May 1958 coup d'état that brought de Gaulle back into power and gave him near dictatorial powers.  November 1973 in Greece - Brigadier Dimitrios Ioannidis overthrew the government of Georgios Papadopoulos in a coup.  May 1934, Lavtia. Kārlis Ulmanis dissolved Parliament and established authoritarian rule with the help of the military.  December 1981, Poland. Wojciech Jaruzelski established the Military Council of National Salvation, a military junta to declare martial law and destroy the Solidarity movement.  In addition, there are dozens of failed attempts at coups in the west. And dozens of successful ones as well if you go back to the 19th century or so.  In the end, it's a definitional thing. If you choose to define ""coup"" narrowly enough that it only counts when tanks ring the parliament/senate buildings and force out civilian government and some guy in uniform bedecked with shiny medals takes over, then sure, there have been more such coups outside the west. It might not be so surprising when you consider that most of the world's population lives outside the west, so statistically it's likelier to happen elsewhere.  But if you consider the problem more generally, which is military interference in civilian government, then the history of the west is full of such examples."

AskSocialScience,38o3ev,twiifm,14,Fri Jun 5 16:46:22 2015 UTC,Why should a firm set aside for a bust rather than simply shut down or exit the market?
AskSocialScience,38o3ev,urnbabyurn,5,Fri Jun 5 19:47:28 2015 UTC,"Because boards of directors and managers want to keep their jobs/positions?  Because of employee/management/regulator capture pressuring them to keep the doors open?    I think this goes to a failure we have in theory of the firm, or at least a neglected area asfaik.  The relationship between the board and the managers (and employee unions/interests & political interests) is often not going to be optimally maximizing profit or firm value.  From what little I've read in contract and IO theory, I think there's a real problem where we're missing the institutional inertia in firms (and regulators).    Additionally, there are probably decent explanations within more standard context - value of brand name, institutional knowledge, networking effects all encourages firms to weather the storm and wait out the slump so they can reap in profits after, maximizing expected future profits.  Not all firms will do this of course, but it has to be part of the reason for some of them."
AskSocialScience,38o3ev,MayorOfCrownKing,3,Fri Jun 5 22:40:43 2015 UTC,I don't disagree but why would shareholders support that?

AskSocialScience,38o3ev,urnbabyurn,3,Fri Jun 5 22:49:11 2015 UTC,"I think shareholders might support keeping many employees around as an investment for future returns on branding and benefits from institutional knowledge.  There have to at least be occasional benefits to being a well operating firm when the market bounces back, and owners surely care about future returns, right? Certainly people do this when they invest in startups or growing industries.    It may be maximizing income, or rather expected lifetime income to do this though.  Managers lose their own branding by looking bad when they close shop.  Also I think this appeals to Hicks's quote about monopolies, 'the greatest surplus is an easy life'.

I think that part of the answer hinges on whether and how you will be utilizing the data from the 2003 study. If you will be operationalizing retention as the average difference in knowledge of a given subject between the 2003 study and the present, then it could be characterized as a longitudinal, repeated cross section. This is similar in nature to tracking the support for a political candidate over time, where repeated cross sections of a given population (voters) are taken to track changes in support for the candidate. So, as long as you are making (and supporting) the claim that you are drawing a sample from the same population as the original study, then you are using a repeated cross section with two measurement points.  Otherwise, if the original data plays no role in the analysis, I would have to think that there is no way to characterize this as longitudinal.  Hopefully this gets some gears turning. Good luck.

AskSocialScience,38nyx1,JurijFedorov,9,Fri Jun 5 13:16:35 2015 UTC,"Hi there, I'll take a crack at this.   While I wouldn't agree that the question is as simple as the cold-war-era question of whether China's economy uses central planning or not (especially since centrally planned economies do not have generally large financial markets for private sector industries, which are open to both foreign & domestic investors...which China has a market capitalization / GDP ratio of around 50%). So...this probably isn't the right framework in which to see the China question.   Instead, try to view china as a large emerging market.   As for your question of whether Chinese growth will slow down.....   I'd say that the real question is, why was china's growth so fast in the first place. Classical econ theory would point to Veblen's idea of Latecomer Advantage (some troubles with paywalls on that one). The idea basically predicts that a newly industrializing country would experience high rates of growth at first, since they can directly implement the latest tech & most recently developed existing know-how, but growth would slow down as opportunities to grow by doing that would become fewer and further between as the country catches up economically and technologically. That was true for Japan and Korea during the 20th century, it's true for China and India today, and it will be true for other parts of asia later in this century.   The idea of extensive growth would tell a similar story, and again, is a story which mostly plays out in emerging markets.  For china in particular, the answer is that not only are we already seeing a slowing down of GDP growth, but also, the WB is projecting that going forward  As for your questions of whether it's economy would crash, it is worth considering this question in the context of what might provoke international financial capital and trade flows.   For the rest, I'd refer you to the China chapter of the world economic forum's world competitiveness report  There you can see a lot of relevant data about wwhere china stands on specific issues (and the data will show that they still have a lot of room for improvement on the institutional side of things....so their latecommer advantage isn't completely spent just yet)."

AskSocialScience,38nyx1,mberre,3,Fri Jun 5 17:45:43 2015 UTC,"So, no?   well, you asked two questions. basically,   the case for predicting a slowdown of their economic growth looks like a ""yes"". Furthermore, it's a yes can be expressed from classical economic theory.  the case for China to see a crash (as in....a financial crisis) looks like a "" they will eventually face the same cyclical volatility as other major emerging economies someday, but nothing about their macroeconomic situation seems to indicate that this is right around the corner""     Let's say 50% of the industry is corrupt state industry. I'd think it would mean that if the state fails the country fails.   why should we suppose that these parts of the econ would have meaningfully divergent outcomes in the first place? Fundamentally, I don't see a lot of hard indicators which would indicate that such a divergence is likely in the near future.   But...those are just market predictions on my part. The main thing I would say is that the macroeconomic fundamentals don't really seem to indicate much with respect to this point."

To be precise, approximately 3.05% of boys and approximately 1.57% of girls would have an IQ of 130 or higher in this model.  These differences would grow wider as one gets farther from the mean.  For example, using the same model as the previous paragraph, one would expect more than six times as many boys as girls with an IQ of 160 or higher.  Keep in mind that this is an entirely mathematical comment.  I have no idea whether such large gender differences (or indeed any gender differences at all) appear in real-world IQ data, and I have no idea whether it's reasonable to expect IQ to be normally distributed, especially with respect to the tails of the distribution.

Indeed, the study uses a sample size that is O(10,000). That's pretty big.   I'm a physicist and not a sociologist, so my apologies if this is bleedingly obvious to you stat-heads ;), but I wanted to get a feeling for how well you could measure IQ mean/stdev from a given population sample size. This is without a doubt in standard textbooks, but playing with some quick random-number generation in Mathematica gave this, which means the statistical precision of their study is about 0.2 for IQ mean and 0.1 for IQ stdev.

This is not what we observed.    this is not a good statistical test. if you look at their table 2, for 126 different computed variance ratios, only 7 of them were less than 1!   if your null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the men and women, you should expect that about half of the variance ratios should be greater than 1 and half should be less than 1. this is CLEARLY not the case, as they only see a variance ratio less than 1 about 7% of the time while men have observed higher variance about 90% of the time. they definitely have evidence of heterogeneity across countries, but i think they are making a stronger claim than their data can support."
AskSocialScience,38ffpk,issem,26,Thu Jun 4 01:51:50 2015 UTC,"I think you've misunderstood what they were studying here. They were addressing the claim that there is inherently more variation in intelligence in men versus women. They've shown that cross culturally this isn't true so the proponents of that theory need to show: 1) how culture can modify the variation between genders, and 2) why this cultural mechanism isn't the primary explanation in their suggested observations.   The fact that some countries show variation isn't a problem, and the fact that the majority of countries show variation isn't a problem. The only problem is that not all countries show variation, as this contradicts (or is at least apparently incompatible with) the idea that the variation is inherent to gender.   There is no need to assume that if there is no inherent causal factor then the distribution should be equal because the actual causal factor (e.g. some cultural mechanism) could differ across societies. For example, if I propose that the choice of eating utensils is not driven by genetic factors then I could help support this by showing that there is a variety of eating utensils used by various cultures. If I find that the majority of countries use knives and forks, and only some use chopsticks, that doesn't mean the genetic account is more likely - it just means that something like cultural transmission explains how it spread through many of the countries."

Well firstly I don't think we need to deal with such hypotheticals here as the disconfirmations were far more substantial than that. But secondly, in those cases assuming the stats are legit and the result is a true result (rather than a confound), then yes - it's enough for us to doubt a claim of innateness.   This is because an innate behavior should be universal across individuals (at the very least universally observed across cultures, as that would account for possible mutations or idiosyncratic aberrations in an individual). Pretty much the only way the proponents could try to argue for innateness is if they came up with a cultural mechanism to explain that one deviation that is consistent with their innate theory, and then they'd need to demonstrate why that cultural mechanism can't explain all the other results as well (i.e. if we're accepting that cultural mechanisms can modify variability in intelligence then why propose an innate mechanism at all?).  An alternative would be to change their proposal so that it isn't an inherent characteristic as such but rather an innate predisposition, meaning that the male population is primed to develop this variability given the right environmental triggers. This would be like the attempted explanation for fear of spiders and snakes, as nobody innately fears them but there is some evidence that maybe we are innately prepared to learn to fear them moreso than other things. I'm not really sure how something like that could apply to characteristics as broad as intelligence though.   people claim that cigarettes cause cancer. but i have an uncle that smoked his whole life and he never got cancer. therefore cigarettes must not cause cancer, since there exists at least one counterexample. that's just not a valid way to draw conclusions from observational data.   That's not really a valid comparison because, as I mention above, the innate hypothesis requires that it affects all individuals (unless a second explanation is raised to account for the deviation). So whilst things like smoking causing cancer is a probabilistic claim, the observations required for an innate explanation is more of a necessary claim.   So if you wanted an analogy, it would be more like saying all of the balls in this bag are blue and when pulling out a number of red balls, you say it doesn't matter because they're mostly blue. If your claim requires that all the balls are blue, and they aren't all blue, then there's a problem. There's a similar hypothetical in evolutionary biology where it's suggested that if we found the fossilised remains of a rabbit in Precambrian rock then evolution would be disproved (or at least brought into serious doubt without some additional explanation). It doesn't matter if most of the results are consistent with our claim, if our claim requires that all results are consistent with our claim."

No, I'm not suggesting that we need perfect adherence at all. What I'm suggesting is that a solid theory requires that there is a lack of disconfirming/falsifying observations.    if the test they are using is the one that these authors are using, then all this empiricist has to do is keep looking and with a probability of one, they will eventually hit a group for which the sample variance of coconuts eaten for the brown haired people will be higher than that of the blonds. this is obviously folly, because we designed this island and we KNOW that the blonds have a higher variance.   I don't think this follows at all. If the sampling is random and accurate, and there aren't methodological flaws, why would we observe a reverse of the expected effect? And what would cause it to occur at a high rate (e.g. 10% of all samples)?   we are talking about population VARIANCE! this is by nature rooted in probability and statistics.   Not quite - we're talking about a set characteristic, that the variability will be higher in men. The claim isn't that we'll see a variance in a characteristic but rather than the greater variance is the characteristic under study.  If evolutionary biologists were to claim that earlier organisms carried a greater genetic variance than later organisms, and then they found that some species of earlier ancestors carried less genetic variance than later organisms, then that would be a huge problem for their claim. It can't be explained by ""oh it's talking about variation so it's just a probabilistic claim"".   it's entirely plausible that the small number of cohorts that don't show variance ratios greater than one fail to find them for idiosyncratic reasons totally unrelated to cultural norms.   I don't see how it's plausible at all. If it's an inherent characteristic, then why isn't it inherent to all groups? Especially when the number of groups that deviate from the claim is so high.   but the trend they find is striking : there is a large difference (about 16% on average from looking at their frequency histogram) between the variance of men and women and the only way that they address this fact is to point to the very left hand tail of their distribution and say ""well, it overlaps with one, so QED"" and don't say anything else about it.   I'm not sure what you're referring to here as it doesn't really match anything I can find in the article. The article looks at the data and assesses how well a number of theories can explain it, and it shows that the variability hypothesis fails based on what it predicts. It doesn't just ""say nothing"".    if somebody just put that figure alone on a slide and presented it to a neutral audience, what conclusion do you think would be drawn? i am pretty sure the audience wouldn't all be thinking ""yep, that there is clear evidence that there's no difference between the sexes"".   ...Well of course but how is this a problem for the authors? They haven't at all claimed that there is not variability differences between the genders. They were assessing the claims of the variability hypothesis which is a specific concept that proposes a primarily innate explanation.   The whole point of this article is to start with the empirical fact that there is some variation difference between the genders and determining which explanation best accounts for that observation. Pointing out that there is variation between the genders doesn't tell us that it's innate.   and for my editorial opinion here, i think that these authors had an agenda in mind before they wrote this paper and whats more i think they had their conclusions drawn up before they even calculated their first summary statistic.

And what would cause it to occur at a high rate (e.g. 10% of all samples)?   if you don't understand this point, that explains why you aren't following what i'm saying at all. there are some underlying population parameters regarding the mean and variance of whatever measure you are interested but which are unobservable. the best we can do is sample the population and use the sample to estimate the true underlying parameters.  so if you just sample a group of people, there will be some sample standard deviation and mean associated with whatever you are measuring. this is almost certainly not going to be identically equal to the true underlying population parameter. but, crucially, even if your sample does happen to precisely represent the population, we have no way to know that.  if you resample the same population again, you're very likely going to get different estimates for the mean and variance. if you continue sampling enough times, you are likely to hit some very unlikely outcomes at least some of the time.  i=0 n=0 while(i==0){   x = rnorm(1000, mean=100, sd=50)   y = rnorm(1000, mean=100, sd=54)   sd.x = sd(x)   sd.y = sd(y)   n=n+1   if(sd.y<sd.x){     i=1     print(n)   } } [1] 141         here is a quick piece of code that makes this point. x is a sample of 1000 drawn from a normal distribution with mean 100 and standard deviation of 50. y is a sample of 1000 drawn from a population with the same mean and standard deviation of 55. it will continue to sample from these populations until the sample standard deviation of y is less than the sample standard deviation of x and then it will print how many iterations it took for this to happen. in the above case, it took 141 iterations for this to happen.   obviously, we know for a fact that y has a higher population standard deviation. but since we have pesky unexplained error terms, sometimes our sample isn't going to work out that way. if the test you are going to use to argue the point is that the existence of a single counterexample lets you throw away the assertion that there is a difference between the populations' variances, you would just be flat out wrong in this case.

AskSocialScience,38ffpk,autovonbismarck,-2,Fri Jun 5 08:07:24 2015 UTC,"Do they claim to have shown that there is no inherent biological/genetic difference between the sexes? I see several sentences suggesting that they never try to make that claim.   If gender differences in means and variances are primarily a consequence of innate, biologically determined differences between the sexes, one would expect these differences to be similar among countries regardless of their culture and to remain fairly constant across time.  Such a finding would suggest that little can be done to diminish these differences. In support of this hypothesis, Machin and Pekkarinen [26] claimed that greater male variance in mathematics performance was a “robust phenomenon”   [emphasis mine]   If so, it might not make sense to encourage and direct any but the unusual female toward studying and seeking employment in these latter fields. This viewpoint has led some folks to propose that it may be a waste of time and money to expend resources directed toward trying to increase participation of women in these mathematics-intensive fields    .   In summary, we conclude that gender equity and other sociocultural factors, not national income, school type, or religion per se, are the primary determinants of mathematics performance at all levels for both boys and girls. Our findings are consistent with the gender stratified hypothesis, but not with the greater male variability, gap due to inequity, single-gender classroom, or Muslim culture hypotheses."

However, it's an interesting topic. Be aware, however, that both terms, 'religion' and 'media', are rather broad. Here's some food for thought:  Antiquity  Most of today's dominant religion spread through manual writings. I'm not sure whether this classifies as 'media' according to your interests, but it's probably an important factor. After all, in Islam, Jews and Christians are called ""people of the book"".  Even back then, manuscripts were produced and copied to argue for certain theological positions. If you're interested in that kind of thing, a good start are the following two books:   Ehrman's 'Misquoting Jesus', chapter 6 discusses out how traditional Christian texts were changed, and for what reasons, presumably. Ehrman's 'Forged' goes deeper into the topic of what he calls forgeries.   Similar books exist for the Old Testament (the Torah), and the Koran.  Middle ages  The printing press enabled a more cost-effective production of books, and this obviously had a major impact.   One classic example that comes to mind is the Catholic church and how the printing press enabled two persons to side-step its established teaching on witches.  According to the Canon Episcopi, witchcraft did not really exist. Those who believed in such things 'had been seduced by the Devil in dreams and visions into old pagan errors'. Following the publication of the Malleus Maleficarum, witchcraft became increasingly accepted as a real and dangerous phenomenon, although the Catholic church condemned it as false just three years after its initial publication. While it was probably not the only reason for the following witch hunts, it was a contributing factor.  Another classic example is, of course, Protestantism.  Modern times  In modern times, the Internet is often mentioned as a contributing factor to the rise of the so-called 'Nones', ie. people who say they belong to no religion in surveys. Evidence can be found in Downey (2014)  However, the evidence strongly suggests 'Nones' react to the rise of the Religious Right in the US since the 70ies. That is, they are morally outraged by the intrusion of the religious right into politics, which motivated them to re-evaluate their allegiance to their religion. Consequently, many move away from it.  This raises the question why the so-called Religious Right was influential in the first place. Kruse (2015) argues that ""Corporate America invented Christian America"" in reaction to the New Deal back in 1938. Chances are, some of his arguments touch the influence of media companies on the transition, so this might be your best chance to find more relevant material.  Hope this helps."

AskSocialScience,38fw44,timnuoa,5,Wed Jun 3 23:09:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what kind of answer you're looking for.  Psychology is a very broad field, so you can't expect the field to form a consensus concerning one relatively new theory. Also, The Righteous Mind is a book with many claims, each of which some psychologists might disagree with, without necessarily rejecting the rest of Haidt's claims. There's also the question whether any rejection of some claims is based on evidence. Psychologists are humans, too.  Some thoughts and pointers concerning the main aspects of the book:  Social intuitionism  Generally speaking, the emphasize of intuition in forming moral judgments are in line with dual process theories. These make quite a lot of sense of predictable irrationality which were most prominently demonstrated by Kahneman and Tversky, among others.  However, some critics say that Haidt has over-emphasized the role of intuition. Paxton & Green (2010) think, there are two different pathways for moral judgment: An deontological one driven by intuitions, and a utilitarian one mostly driven by rational considerations.  Halion & Pizarro (2015) also argue that dual process theories are too simple, and the picture is more complicated.  Classification  In the Righteous Mind, Haidt already extended his five foundation to six. Since then, he extended it to seven to account for libertarians in the US.  It's worth noting that Haidt used a bottom-up approach, combining existing theories into one. A top-down approach would have been using something like factor analysis. The advantage is that he can rely on quite a bit of evidence for each of his (initial) foundations; especially moral disgust.   An alternative classification is proposed by anthropologist Alan Fiske (1992). His classification is based on the relationship between people. For a comparison to Haidt, see Steven Pinker's ""The Better Angels of Our Nature"".  In my opinion, such classifications are neither true nor false, but useful or not. Haidt's scheme is more intuitive, and closer to personal experience.  The liberal-conservative distinction  Haidt's description is based on his evidence which he describes in his book.   I'm unaware of any replication from independent researchers, however, which is kind of a bummer today. But other research basically confirms some kind of fundamental distinction, see Hibbing, Smith, and Alford (2014), for instance.  Group-based evolution  This is probably the most contentious aspect of the book. Group-based evolution is considered problematic by most biologists, ecologists, and evolutionary psychologists, as far as I know.  There are two proposed alternatives to account for the liberal-conservative distinction that I'm aware of:   Avi Tuschman (2013) links the distinction to sexuality: There are benefits of risk-seeking (liberal) behavior concerning sex (diversity protects against viruses, etc.) but of risk-averse (conservative) behavior also has benefits.  Hibbing, Smith and Alford (2014) suggest conservatism is probably more basic and fundamental, because it is more suited to a world in which life is “nasty, brutish, and short.” Modern times may have unleashed more variability among the human species, due to the reduction of the basic threats. They fall back on group-based evolution to explain why all human groups are politically diverse.  Hope this helps."

You're pointing out that restrictive governments fell to popular revolutions. What is it that these revolutions wanted? Was it just the right to vote? What else would have to change in order to have the right to vote, and what would change as a result of the right to vote?   A country can have universal suffrage but what good does it do if the vote is rigged every year? Universal suffrage exercised in fair elections certainly keeps the government in check, yet the form of government has to allow the result of the vote to have influence.   So then the question is, what is it about the form of governments of the countries that prevailed that lead them to do so? Voting rights is one difference, but is that really at the core of the issue? What influence did the actual form of government have? And beyond the form of government, was there something meaningful in the economic or social climate that was influential (prosperity, literacy, social capital, innovation, education quality, religious freedom, etc)? Were these things different because the populace had the right to vote, or because of the form of government, or vice versa?   Finally, I point to the current trend in Europe, where universal suffrage and fair elections are the norm and the extreme right parties are gaining in popularity."
AskSocialScience,38di7f,gorillalifter47,5,Wed Jun 3 14:42:44 2015 UTC,"Great question.  So for terminology sake, typically the changing preferences for urban living argument is referred to as the 'demand-side' explanation for gentrification while the rent-gap is referred to as the 'supply-side' explanation.  It is (the mostly theoretical) gap between the price of urban land today (imagine a vacant building) and its price if it were brought up to its ""highest and best use"" (imagine a shiny new apartment building).  It might be useful to think about it as a signal to developers/assorted capitalists that the land is now ripe for profit extraction.  I want to point out that Smith, the supply-side rent gap theorist and his demand-side contemporaries yelled and screamed about which was the definitive theory of gentrification - a feud that actually led to published articles in which they resorted to ridiculous name-calling for example and another example.  In truth, as you say, a theory of gentrification involves both supply and demand-side dynamics.    Consider the value of land is a function of local amenities and disamenities like crime, access to employment and retail centers and distance to parks and transit amenities.  Thus, according to the rent gap theory, holding demand constant, if an area experienced a dramatic decrease in crime, then we should expect a rent gap to emerge.  However, without changing preferences for urban living and an aggregate increase in demand for city locations, then the rent gap would not be a particularly useful signal for developers.    Lastly, I'll just mention that what makes the rent gap so difficult to identify is the fact the term 'highest and best use' is so vague.  Consider that a flock of investors who are all very experienced real estate developers with ninja like discounted cash flow skills will likely never agree on the value of that land in the next 5, 10 or 15 years.  Why? Because highest and best use in Manhattan for instance, in 2015 is not what it was in 2005 and likely not what it will be in 2030.

AskSocialScience,38empj,Vladith,3,Wed Jun 3 18:33:09 2015 UTC,"I'm a Marxist, so I can't pretend that I'm ""unbiased"" on this question. That said, I'm convinced that one of the things the Marxist view brings to the table is a comprehensive and useful definition of capitalism - useful because it is able to distinguish capitalism from other forms of socioeconomic activity.   That definition is often given as ""exploitation,"" but this is a very incomplete picture of what capitalism for a Marxist. Exploitation is not a unique feature of capitalism, but is a characteristic of class societies generally. We have to recourse to other features to figure out what distinguishes capitalism from, say, feudalism. This includes features like wage labor, pervasive commodity production, the proliferation of markets and currency, firms and economies of ever-increasing scale, and technological development specifically aimed towards productivity increases.  So why did Marx put forward this definition of capitalism, and not, a definition of capitalism as ""individual transactions,"" or ""free trade between property owners?""  One of the ways in which you can characterize Marx's project is as an attempt to debunk the notion that capitalism is natural:    Marx was to centre his entire critique of political economy on what he considered its decisive weakness its tendency to view society ahistorically, or, more specifically, its inclination to treat capitalist economy as one working directly in accordance with the laws of nature. All Marx’s detailed criticisms of political economy’s erroneous conceptions of value, money, capital, etc., which fill the pages of Capital and even more so of Theories of Surplus Value, rest finally upon this, his basic criticism.  ...  Now when Marx criticised the political economists for the ahistorical nature of their work, he meant that they could not grasp that their own science had emerged and developed only under these determinate conditions. Political economy laboured under the serious misapprehension of all bourgeois thought that the categories of its subject (value, capital, money, labour, etc.) were not only the product of merely individual minds but that the laws which these minds had (inexplicably) discovered were valid for all epochs. They conflated the laws specific to a determinate mode of production with laws they thought to he universally valid; they confused social with natural law. Political economy was fond of the parable of Robinson Crusoe. Marx did not object to the indulgence in this type of story as such. He did object, however, to the fact that the modern (eighteenth-century) individual was projected back into history. The individual was not conceived as developing historically through definite social relations, but as posited once and for all by nature. History was confused with nature; pre-capitalist economic forms were treated with the same disdain as Christians treated pre-Christian religious forms.   -- Geoff Pilling, Marx’s Critique of Classical Economics   To provide another example, if we define capital as ""privately-owned productive wealth,"" then we could say that feudal freeholding peasants owned capital in the form of their homestead. Similarly, if we define capitalism as ""individual transactions conducted in a market,"" then capitalism appears in historical settings as diverse as ancient Rome and feudal Japan. This puts us in the awkward position of accounting (1) what it means for phenomena like capital to exist outside of a capitalist context and (2) what use there is in describing our own economic system as ""capitalist"" if all other economic systems appear as ""capitalist,"" albeit with some arbitrary qualifier (e.g. ""capitalism with feudalism"" or ""capitalism with ancient Mediterranean slave economy"").  Definitions of capitalism as human nature, or as some broad, transhistorical kind of human behavior (economic exchange) may be strictly true - clearly capitalism doesn't conflict with whatever human nature there is, and involves activities like economic exchange. The critical Marxist response to such definitions, however, is that they are not useful or interesting because do not tell us what is unique about capitalism - what justifies the use of the term ""capitalism"" in the first place, as opposed to some all-encompassing signifier like ""human economic activity."""

More immigration of those minority groups. Edit:  This is a better article that goes into greater depth than I did. http://www.japanfocus.org/-Arudou-Debito/2078/article.html  Japan doesn't have large rate of immigration for a few reasons. 1. Language barrier: English is taught fairly widely so going to an English Speaking country is easier. Look at foreign language education and countries with high immigration rates. If your language is high on the second language track you will get more immigrants. Japanese is not heavily studied in developing countries. So the rates of immigration re lower. 2. Visa requirements and Permanent Resident status- It takes 10 years for a non ""Highly Skilled Professional"" to gain Permanent Resident status. It also can be complicated to get a visa if you don't fall into the select categories desired at the time of your application. 3. Stagnant job market and poor working conditions- Many potential immigrants if not put off by the first two items are put off by the stagnant economy, job market, and long working hours at a Japanese company.     As for the ""never truly accept an immigrant"" comments... that is mostly due to cultural and language reasons. ON average, any foreigner you see in the street (who is easily identifiable as not being Japanese) probably has a mediocre Japanese proficiency at best. So it becomes the stereotype that is reinforced that foreigners don't know the language or the culture. So you don't fully accept them unless they have proven otherwise.  In the West you rarely assume (unless in a specific area) that a person doesn't speak the local language. So the default is to assume they do unless proven otherwise.     http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/english/  http://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2012/01/japans-immigration-control  http://www.japantoday.com/category/lifestyle/view/why-do-japanese-change-their-attitude-when-they-communicate-with-foreigners"

It clearly glosses over the lack of specificity in the question (which has been called out in other comments), and which makes the question almost impossible to deal with before restating it.   In social-scientific terms, it would require a rather novel approach to be able to claim that the West/Asian-distinction in the question holds true: The difference between being an immigrant in, on the one hand, New York City or LA and on the other, in rural Switzerland, is probably as large as can be.   As for /u/whygook's specific arguments:   This applies to every non-English-speaking Western country as well - maybe apart from France (a distant second) and Spain and Portugal (mostly relevant for Latin American migration of which there is quite a lot, both ways).  Visa requirements are not the explananda here, at least not in anything but the very short term. Rather, it should be explained why Japan's visa requirements are so strict.    2b. This also relates to the general comment that    Western Countries had colonies, more exposure to other peoples and cultures.     This basically equates 'the West' with the UK, France, Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands. The Italian and Belgian African colonies did not leave much of an impact on the language (for different reasons, though). It has never been the US colonial effort - which did exist, but from a later stage - that made it possible for migrants to assimilate into American society, and the same goes for Canada (which has no colonial history apart from its own origins).    This is relevant to Japan, mostly. It might be the case for high-skilled migrants, but probably not for low-skilled migrants who could find many economic niches in the service economy. And even for high-skilled ones there would very likely be much more exchange if Japanese jobs were more open to foreigners (which is the same issue that a number of small Western countries have).    (4.) about language - this has been commented on above as well, but again, there's little to no difference between the situation in Japan and that of, say, the Netherlands. Most non-Western migrants in Europe are also dependent on natives speaking a common language (most places, English) until they eventually learn the local language. English-speaking countries have a natural advantage in this respect.   In summary, the question and this answer are equally flawed. You can't - and no social scientist worth his salt would - compare 'the West' with the 'Asian countries'. I understand that Japan was used as an example, and that what is meant in the question was probably East Asia, but that is hardly a more homogenous group. And 'the West' is as heterogeneous when it comes to migratory regimes as anywhere."

In some countries affected by colonialism where English is not a primary language (but permeated in the society otherwise), such as Indonesia, foreigners not being able to speak local language is not stereotyped. Instead locals would often try to help them translating.  When it is the locals not being able to speak English when deemed ""necessary"" though (both in formal and informal settings, like business meetings and usual hangouts), they will be put into shame, usually by the English-fluent locals themselves. There is a term for this: ""kampungan"" or ""norak"", which basically means uncultured or not townsfolk-like.  I've heard similar thing happened in Vietnam too.

When Marx talked about the crisis of overproduction, he predicted that as productivity improved and less and less labor was needed to produce stuff, the masses would be too poor to purchase all the stuff being produced: aggregate demand would collapse, economic chaos would emerge and God knows what would happen after that.  On the contrary, when modern economists talk about overproduction, they are usually referring to a misallocation of resources, the specific difference being that while Marxists see the possibility of aggregate overproduction and an ensuing collapse in demand as too few are employed at too low a rate, modern mainstream economists view the economy rather differently. Specifically, the economy is perceived as a circular and internal system, to put it simply, meaning that in the long run the market adjusts to remove any such Marxist imbalance between aggregate supply and demand. When modern economists talk about overproduction, it usually means the excessive allocation of capital to one sector over others, so that one sector produces much more than is sensible at the expense of other products. But there is no such thing as chronic, aggregate overproduction: more stuff is good for everyone as long as it's distributed in a somewhat equitable manner, which is a question entirely separate from ""overproduction""."
AskSocialScience,389zj3,haalidoodi,3,Wed Jun 3 02:50:41 2015 UTC,"We can say that production has to do with supply. There is never too much productivity as long as people are consuming what is being produced. Therefore, overproduction can be defined as a condition where the supply of a certain good is above the demand for that good.  When that happens, there is usually a surplus of that good, and producers must sell the product for less than the cost it took to make it, so you they end up with a loss. To compensate for this, producers that are less competitive are kicked out of the market and overall supply gets reduced until it reaches the equilibrium.  Overproduction can be seen as a side effect of an economic crisis, or specifically, a decrease in the demand at a certain market. Overproduction gets rid of the suppliers of a good, which decreases the amount of producers, which will also decrease the demand for labor and decrease the overall disposable income of people in a market, which will decrease aggregate demand. This of course, goes in a cycle until it is broken somewhere.  Of course I am looking at overproduction in the Keynesian point of view, which believes that it is the aggregate demand that defines an economy.  I do not know enough to answer your second question."
AskSocialScience,389zj3,Sanguivorantes,2,Wed Jun 3 02:01:12 2015 UTC,"Overproduction can be seen as a side effect of an economic crisis, or specifically, a decrease in the demand at a certain market.   Surely as well as a decrease in demand we can simply see an oversaturation of existing demand, with the problem arising once everyone realises that the demand falls significantly short of the supply?  For example, there is 10 demand for product X.  Company A enters the market and produces 5X, seeing a high rate of profit for its efforts.  Companies B, C and D want in on this high rate of profit and each produce 5X.  There is now 20X but only demand fo 10.  Overproduction causes profits fall, bills to go unpaid, companies to go bust, people to become unemployed, etc.  In this way overproduction could cause a crisis as well as be a side-effect of it.

AskSocialScience,3836f8,pchancharl,41,Mon Jun 1 14:59:44 2015 UTC,"There is very little evidence that human sacrifice was a prolific act, and less evidence exists for virgin sacrifices. The idea surrounding human sacrifice is one that has been built upon by modern media because it seems devious, and making the victim a virgin adds more weight to the image human sacrifice concocts.  In reality, human sacrifice is a murky issue. Very few cultures practiced human sacrifice during times of modern anthropology, so scientific inquiry into their motivations and cultural understanding of the act are hard to come by, and therefore most accounts we have are framed by the casual observer, or more often and less trustworthy, by second- or third-hand accounts.  Our understanding of human sacrifice comes most predominantly from MesoAmerican and South American cultures, most notably from the Tenochtitlan site. However, these accounts were chronicled mostly by Spanish missionaries, who could hardly be considered neutral and analytical observers. There were also cases of the practice performed upon prisoners of war, such as in El Salvador, although it is unclear whether it was wholly considered ritualistic or merely a function of warfare.  The idea of ""virgin"" sacrifices seems to arise mainly from European contexts, and in most cases seems to be examples of cultural mud-slinging. For example, 2nd and 3rd century Pagans and Christians alike cast such allegations at one another, seemingly as evidence of each others' barbarism. It also played a role in a lot of Greek Theater, for example in Euripides' Children of Herakles, though it seems to be an accepted theory that this was an allegorical device and not meant to be taken literally.  The trope is essentially playing upon the idea that native people have little regard for the sanctity of human life, that they misunderstand how the physical world works, and that their metaphysics are built upon the ideas of bestial sexuality. The helplessness of the victim, their gender, and their ""virginity"", are ways of communicating the savagery that European culture has so often framed others as encompassing.

The largest critique I can think of in that piece is that Frazer was very much a progressivist in his theoretical framework of comparative religion, but that was not only regular in his time but persists even today (e.g.: The Evolution of God by Robert Wright). About his work on ritual human sacrifice, I would have to read it at length for myself before I would feel comfortable making comments on any specifics, but I would be hesitant also to take much of Frazer's theory with the same credulity we afford contemporary anthropological theory, which is generally more scientifically rigorous as well as less interpretive in its analyses.

See linked from the Review of Behavioral Economics along those lines  http://www.peterleeson.com/Human_Sacrifice.pdf   This paper develops a theory of rational human sacrifice: the purchase and ritual slaughter of innocent persons to appease divinities. I argue that human sacrifice is a technology for protecting property rights. It improves property protection by destroying part of sacrificing communities’ wealth, which depresses the expected payoff of plundering them. Human sacrifice is a highly effective vehicle for destroying wealth to protect property rights because it is an excellent public meter of wealth destruction. Human sacrifice is spectacular, publicly communicating a  acrificer’s destruction far and wide. Further, immolating a live person is nearly impossible to fake, verifying the amount of wealth a sacrificer has destroyed."

You can only do so by pretending those government functions are natural while other government functions, like regulations and social insurance, are not.   There are of course other things the government does that are greatly beneficial, like funding basic research, public education, and infrastructure. The benefits gained here are masked in many ways.

From 1800-1900, life expectancy doubled, standard of living went up wildly, etc... apart from perhaps subsidizing / mandating the advancements made by non-government actors, what role did government play (keeping in mind that the US government was < 10% of GDP for basically that whole period)?   In that period we also saw the rise of organized labor and and expansion of political participation. We also saw the exploitation of huge fossil fuel reserves. We also saw the Agricultural Revolution. We also saw the responsibilities and actions of the State expand beyond the traditional ""soldiers and judges"". And so on... There are plenty of potential factors.   Prior to the enlightenment, at least in the West you had everyone working in horrible poverty partly due to technology but also partly due to oppressive regimes (which basically everyone lived under). The Kings/lords negotiated trade, regulated, robbed, etc.   That's a really Romantic image of the ancien regime you have there - you're almost mentioning the ius primae noctis :) Fact is that living circumstances varied widely from place to place and estate to estate - and class to class. Also a fact is that industrialization - the archetypical capitalists - initially made the living circumstances of most people worse and destroyed their customary privileges such as limited workdays and holidays... prompting Ricardo to formulate his iron law of wages (wages will tend to subsistence level in the long run in a capitalist economy).   Edit: I was just asking a question-- merriam webster defines capitalism as ""free market"" and ""free market"" as economic activity without government intervention.   Free market and capitalism are not synonyms. A free market is social, legal and geographical space that is free to enter and where it is free to exchange goods and services. Capitalism is the extraction of profit accumulation of capital as a goal onto itself.

AskSocialScience,37yi9l,GoldieMMA,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:34:29 2015 UTC,"If you equate ""capitalism"" and ""economic liberalization"", then the argument makes sense. Economists, for instance, overwhelmingly support free trade, and David Ricardo and Adam Smith, two giants of classical economics, supported it as well.  Additionally, meta-analyses of countries that have undergone economic liberalization reform (moving from illiberal to liberal, or ""market"" models) show a significant correlation between economic liberalization, especially ""external"" liberalization (free trade or reduction in trade barriers/tariffs), and economic growth and prosperity.  While the argument that ""capitalism has lifted millions from poverty"" is overly simplistic, prosperity and capitalism, at least in terms of basic economic liberalization, are connected (p. 21 - 23 of the report are the most illuminating).   Any basic economics textbook will tell you that free trade is a good thing because of the logic of comparative advantage, and that liberal market systems (as opposed to planned or ""command"" systems) are an efficient means of organizing economies due to the fact that no bureaucracy can efficiently organize hundreds of millions of transactions each day. Liberalization increases productivity and enhances well-being over time: though the original input costs of reform are large, the benefits far outweigh these costs, as can be seen in the empirical literature I have provided."

AskSocialScience,380uke,iamtheeggman91,6,Mon Jun 1 00:52:31 2015 UTC,"Your linked article sort of explains it - it says that buying the treasury bonds has helped weaken the Yuan relative to the dollar, which is beneficial for exports. The US trade deficit with China has steadily increased, and was up to $342 billion last year. If China stopped doing this, its products would be less competitive in the American market.  Relevant passage from an article linked by the article you linked:   China makes sure its currency, the yuan, is always lower than the U.S. dollar. Why? Part of its economic strategy is to keep its export prices competitive. It does this by holding the yuan at a fixed rate compared to a basket of currencies, the majority of which is the dollar. When the dollar falls in value, the Chinese government uses extra currency to buy Treasuries, which increases demand for the dollar, increasing its value. In addition, China promises to redeem dollars for yuan at the fixed rate. Obviously, it must keep a good supply of dollars, as Treasury notes, in reserve.   Basically, China is not buying treasury bonds as an investment, they are buying them in order to manipulate currency exchange rates.

AskSocialScience,37yp0z,Sadistic_Sponge,15,Sun May 31 15:00:16 2015 UTC,"To point 1:  I am wholly unconvinced by his retort for several reasons.   The most alarming thing I see is that he doesn't do much to corroborate that the survey actually happened. He previously sent Broockman an email from a person that didn't exist from a survey company to validate that it did, in fact, happen. Until he proves that the survey data actually got collected his responses to statistical problems are totally irrelevant. Literally none of this post matters beyond this point until then. A paper trail for a study this big should be enormous. Am I supposed to believe that he deleted all of his emails with the survey company? They didn't have a receipt on record or something? He is clearly very thorough with his email records, it is strange that he does almost nothing to rebut this claim.  He presents receipts from several apple computers and Ipads to corroborate that he used them as an incentive instead of paying them like he claimed he did originally. It seems strange that these incentives were paid for several months apart, though he implies this is because some of the devices were for a different study. It is also strange that some of these devices are purchased on multiple credit cards. Speaking from experience, this would make getting reimbursements even harder and typically researchers are given a single university credit card. It also goes without saying that these things can be made up easily and I'd love to see the bar codes tested. It would also be nice to see record that respondents were actually given the laptops as awards, which is typically required.  He blames the IRB for his decision to delete all the raw data files, but it doesn't hold up.    Protocols should be designed to minimize the need to collect and maintain identifiable information  about research participants.  If possible,  data should be collected anonymously or the identifiers should be removed and destroyed as soon as possible.    He quotes the IRB above. It clearly says that IDENTIFYING information needs to be removed from the data, not the entire dataset. This seems like an extremely weak argument. Also, if he is so concerned about meeting IRB requirements it seems odd that based on his timeline he did not file IRB approval until after the study had been completed (see also this dropbox by the IRB saying he needs to tell Science it was not IRB reviewed . Lastly, if he was deleting his email contacts with the survey company due to IRB concerns or something like that (my guess, he doesn't say this), why did he email Broockman the fake email correspondence with the survey company.    He admits that he lied about his funding source. >In fact, I received a grant offer from the Williams Institute, but never accepted the funds,the LA GLBT received funding from the Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr.  Fund., and the Ford Foun-dation grant did not exist   However, he never provides any proof that he actually received the grant application from the Williams Institute. You'd think he'd have saved the letter or email, given how meticulously he documents other conversations. (Edit: This was erroneous, see comment thread.)   His claim that Broockman used the wrong variable is uncompelling. It seems to me that it would just mean LaCour's data resembles the wrong variable, not that it wasn't fabricated.  He claims they manipulate the variable by recoding NA's to 50 (of 100). In the original Broockman report they explain that this is because LaCour's data had no NA's so they assumed a starting value of 50, since this is the default starting value for web surveys using such questions. An untouched question would still register as 50 because of that. LaCour claims this is an unheard of, but it seems to make sense to me. In addition, some missing data strategies will code missing values to a valid value, using a dummy variable in regression models to control for missingness. See Allison's book Missing Data for a discussion- it isn't a good strategy unless data is missing by design, but it is certainly a plausible strategy.  The ""fixed"" graphs that Lacour presents are not compelling indicators that his data is not fabricated based on the the 2012 CCAP data. The main difference is that the peak on the far right is not present- other than that the graphs are still incredibly similar, save that the CCAP has slightly larger bars because it has a much larger sample size. While he is able to demonstrate statistical differences between the data, they still seem very similar save some random noise added and the redistributing of some of the highest values. Even the QQ plots he presents are not terribly different after ""fixing"" by using the ""correct"" variable and coding. He never responses to the lack of between-wave variability in a way that is compelling. He hits on this in two sentences in point 4, but he doesn't really say anything. It is odd that there are no extreme cases. This is odd- usually in survey data with multiple waves and 10,000+cases you'll find at least one or two people who go from ranging homophobe to gay pride king. Broockman note the lack of such variability and the presence of relatively artificial truncation, but he does nothing to retort to this.   https://twitter.com/BCalfano/status/604663897417596928 The author of the ""replication study"" LaCour cites has tweeted that the study was not a replication and is only preliminary unpublished results. These are not an appropriate defense of LaCour's thesis.  LaCour does not address lying about the receipt of certain teaching awards on his vita. Perhaps this is not the place, but it is another strike against his credibility (http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/05/michael-lacour-made-up-a-teaching-award-too.html).    I could probably go on and someone else can do a better job about the statistical analysis he does, perhaps. I'm not familiar with the whole ""lumping"" issue that they go over with the distribution of the gay feeling thermometer so I'm not touching it.

On this affecting the field of political science, well I can't see this instance really destroying the reputation of an entire field of (social) science. I mean plagiarism and outright fraud pops up in most fields from time to time - sometimes in high-level publications as well (the guy on the cover of TIME with a cloned afghan IIRC etc.). What really matters is how it's dealt with, and in this I think academia is unison in having zero tolerance with it.  The fact remains, that a top publication yields very high rewards - in economics a single AER/JPE/ECTA can get you tenure in a very decent place, so there's obviously a huge incentive to push for top journals.  But if these are obtained with fabricated or fraudulent data, then the downside risk is huge - get caught out and you're basically done.  The question then is, whether, considering the risks of this strategy it is deemed feasible. I would think that most scientists would say that no, it most certainly is not.

AskSocialScience,37yp0z,tr3g,6,Sun May 31 15:21:16 2015 UTC,"In one of his media interviews, Don Green says something along the lines of fraud is difficult to find in the short-term, but as happened here, in the long-term, it will be discovered, particularly if it is in a big outlet like this and if it is a result that garners attention.  The simple fact of the matter is that there is little defense against outright fraud, particularly when the scholar has collected the data. Short of having been there during the survey, there is no way for anybody to know that a survey respondent indicated ""strongly agree"" rather than ""strongly disagree.""  That doesn't mean the discipline isn't taking steps, though. The AJPS now sends the replication materials for every accepted article  to UNC's Odom Institute to test if it they work. The articles will not be  published until they are approved. Also, the author of every accepted article must put the replication materials on the AJPS Dataverse before publication. More and more journals are running each and every submission through plagiarism software.   These things won't - and can't - catch fraud.   While I don't think Green is free from blame here (you have to look at the data before publishing, at least!), it seems that LaCour acted alone and is unique in his sociopathy.

I'll provide one suggested by Roxanne Lynn Doty in a chapter of State Sovereignty as a Social Construct entitled ""Sovereignty and the nation: constructing the boundaries of national identity"". Also note that I'm reading in between the lines a little bit but I think my interpretation of her essay is fairly faithful.  Doty argues that after the collapse of the British Empire post-WWII, Britain had to redefine its identity: formerly this answer was fairly easy (as far as questions of identity go). Britain was the heart of a great colonial empire but now it needed to rethink its identity. Nations are imagined communities: unlike, say, states, whose boundaries are relatively fixed, the notion of belonging to a nation is relatively fluid.  So after the collapse of the Empire, there were two competing identities: ""little England"" and the ""Commonwealth ideal"". The first of these corresponds to the ""heart"" above: the story of the British empire was that Britain through its advancement and majesty had united much of the world. The little England identity emphasised the virtues of the people of Great Britain. The Commonwealth ideal, on the other hand, sought to preserve the unity that those people had established by extending those virtues to the former colonies. Both of them tried to define who got to be British; one was exclusive, one was inclusive.  These two overlapping visions of identity did not conflict at first, when immigration was mostly from white former colonies (these immigrants were largely ethnically British). In fact, there were no immigration controls on people coming from former colonies at the time. But after a while, non-white immigration surpassed white immigration. Two things then happened.  Firstly, many British people became uncomfortable with Britishness being defined in terms of these ""different"" people. Secondly, right wing politicians and media observed that the decline of the British Empire coincided with obvious (ie., non-white) immigration. They managed to sell the public on this fallacy and immigration controls were introduced. This led to a self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts: at that point, the government had the legal authority to decide who got in in the first place-- who became British -- and would-be immigrants were quite literally shut out. The overlap was resolved in favour of the exclusive, ""little England"" conception of Britishness. Since identity exhibits a strong degree of path dependency (ie., who you were affects who you are now) this remains largely true to this day.  tl;dr: racism, and the inconvenient fact that immigrants happened to come to the country when the British Empire was being thoroughly embarrassed."
AskSocialScience,37z8qv,Ienpw_III,9,Mon Jun 1 01:50:53 2015 UTC,"Regarding the second part of your question: No, the British public is not more xenophobic than that of other countries.  Check this Spring 2014 study hosted by PewGlobal.  In a study of 7 important European countries, fewer people in the UK think immigrants are a burden on the country than in France, Poland, Greece, Italy, France or Spain. Only Germany has a more positive view of the impact immigrants have.  In the UK, 20% believe immigrants ""are more to blame for crime"". This time Germany rates the same question at 48%, Greece has over 50%. No other country surveyed has a more positive view than the UK for this question.  On whether each country should increase immigration, the UK falls right in the middle of all the countries, with 55% saying fewer immigrants should be taken in the UK, vs. 86% in Greece and 40% in Poland.  However, the net migration rate in the UK is 2.56/1000 pop. source  Comparing this to the other countries, you see that countries far more against immigration than the UK by this measure (Italy, Greece) have very high net migrant rates. (Italy is above the UK, Greece is just below.)  France (57%) and Germany (44%) meanwhile have rates less than half of the UK, and yet have similarly high objection to increasing the rate of immigration into the country.  Statistically, I don't think it can be argued that the UK is more xenophobic or racist than other countries."
AskSocialScience,37z8qv,Joe64x,3,Mon Jun 1 12:59:04 2015 UTC,"Interesting stats.  However, I think it's also necessary to note how much emphasis is put on immigration in each of these countries.    According to the most recent Standard Eurobarometer only 18% of people in the EU28 put immigration as one of the top 2 issues facing their country.  Compare this to 38% in the UK.  Germany is close with 37%, but then you have Italy on 18%, Poland on 17%, France on 11%, Greece on 6%, and Spain on 2%.  So clearly immigration, while significant numbers may be wary of it, isn't as hot a political topic in most places as it is in the UK.  The same poll also asked about feelings towards immigration, and somewhat contradicts Pew's findings.  When asked how they felt about immigration from within the EU the UK gave the second highest 'very negative' response at 19%, only behind Cyprus (and joint with Italy).  Of the countries you mentioned the UK had the second worst 'total negative' score at 52%, just behind Italy at 56%.  This is emphasised when the poll asks whether the right of EU citizens to live in every member state is a good or a bad thing.  The UK is the only country in the EU28 where ""a good thing"" is below 50%, and it's 10% below its nearest competitor Belgium.  Most countries score 20-30% higher.  Similarly the UK has the highest percentage saying it's ""a bad thing"", at 23%, 4% ahead of Belgium.  The same question asked about the right to work, the UK is again by far the most negative.  Where the UK does pick up a little, and this may explain the difference in our data, is when it comes to immigration from outside the EU.  While the UK still has a high 'total negative' score at 57%, it's better than Germany (61%), Greece (75%), France (58%), and Italy (75%)."
AskSocialScience,37z8qv,Dzerzhinsky,3,Mon Jun 1 17:31:59 2015 UTC,"I suppose the stats don't lie, but I've lived in France and I couldn't say immigration isn't as hot a topic there as it is in the UK with a straight face. The largest party in the European elections are the National Front with 24.86% of the vote. The best selling book when I was last there was Le Suicide Français which is a book highly critical not just of institutions like the EU, but of ""communautarisme"" where groups (read: immigrants) destroy the nation's culture from the inside: ""Le suicide français"".  I think if you look at attitudes towards the EU, the UK will always be less favourable than continental Europe. But I don't think this translates to xenophobia, really. As you said, when you look at immigration outside the EU, the UK seems at the very least not to be an outlier."
AskSocialScience,37z8qv,Joe64x,2,Mon Jun 1 17:46:56 2015 UTC,"I must admit that I was surprised by how low the percentage was for France.  But they still had a 42% 'total negative' rating for EU immigration and 58% for non-EU, so it isn't hard to see how that can translate into an FN victory in an EU election or get a book onto the best seller list.  I wouldn't say that the UK will always be less favourable than continental Europe.  I live in Scotland and hear almost nothing about immigration from people living here.  Indeed, the EU and Westminster elections were won by a party that vocally favours increased immigration.  This is despite Scotland seeing higher rates of immigration than places in England where UKIP is strong."

AskSocialScience,37x9dh,diporasidi,6,Sun May 31 04:04:34 2015 UTC,"A lot of people thought Steven Pinker threw the humanities under the bus when he adopted scientism a while back.   Pinker... has the intellectual stature and public visibility to nudge the debate forward in a positive direction. Instead of embracing scientism as a positive label, he should have acknowledged that some criticism of science is well founded and sorely needed. Instead of telling us again platitudes about the benefits of science (while ignoring its darker side) and chastising the humanities for not embracing it whole heartedly, he could have presented a nuanced examination of where science really is useful to the humanities and where the latter are useful to the sciences - not to mention those several areas where the two can safely ignore each other in pursuit of different goals.    Massimo Pigliucci (philsopher/biologist)   In the meat of his article, Pinker puts forth a number of mostly silly straw-man definitions of 'scientism' which he then has no trouble dismissing.  For example, he suggests that on one understanding of scientism, it is the claim that ""all current scientific hypotheses are true.""  Is Pinker joking? No reputable writer has ever said that or defined scientism in terms of it.    William F. Vallicella(philosopher)   Pinker’s self-congratulatory suggestion that only science recognizes the complexity and the obscurity of the world—his implication that in the nonscientific disciplines the acquisition of knowledge, if knowledge is even acquired, is easy—is very unimpressive. It betrays a contempt for humanistic exertion, even as he accuses the liberal arts in many universities of “cultivat[ing] a philistine indifference to science that shades into contempt.”   Leon Wieseltier(Literary critic)   Pinker never seems to have understood postmodernism. Postmodern scholarship, like science itself, can be done well or badly, but its animating assumption is simple: All truth claims--whether scientific, religious or political—reflect the prejudices and desires of those who make them. Claims that become dominant in a culture often serve the interests of powerful groups.   John Horgan (science journalist)   I differ with Pinker’s assertion that a scientific approach to politics would improve our understanding of it. What Pinker calls “human nature” is not something to be fully understood in scientific terms.[24] In fact, one can easily show that science itself is subject to the vagaries of political ideologies and the tendencies in “human nature” (whole fields like the sociology of science devote themselves to exploring these influences). This idea alone should give us pause and encourage the employ of a more thoroughgoing skepticism about a science of politics, and more generally, of science and politics.   Sebastian Normandin(Historian of medicine)   Assholes like Steven Pinker think that people in the humanities resist their ideas because we don’t understand ""science.""  But the truth is that many people in the humanities love and embrace the sciences:  there are historians of science, there are digital humanities, there are philosophers of technology.  What we resist isn’t ""science”; what we resist are obnoxious fucking ignoramuses like you who come up in our house and tell us how ignorant we are, how much we don’t understand, and what we should be doing with our research.  This is not an issue of science vs. humanities - this is the nature of contemporary academic research and, indeed, human nature itself.   someone called FUCK THEORY  Obviously, for interdisciplinarians this was a really ugly move.   Pinker's also unpopular for other reasons - here is Carr, Rushkoff and Morozovtalking about something he wrote. I don't know how psychologists feel about him but it seems like he has an unfortunate tendency of popularizers with an audience to shoot their mouth off about things they don't know."

Of course presenting those facts means that he looks less like a hero fighting against the powers that be.

They're just describing the fact that evolutionary psychologists who take that approach rely on a kind of faith that their assumptions are true, and this is made worse by the fact that many of their assumptions aren't true.

The more respectable evo psych is usually done by people who don't generally identify as evo psychologists, usually biologists and ethologists looking into the evolutionary roots of behavior. One of the authors of that chapter, Russell Gray, has some good evo psych work looking at evolved behaviors in New Caledonian crows.    Calling something a church which is not a church is not something you do in scientific writings but in self help books or personal opinion books.

AskSocialScience,37vebg,ThatAssholeYahweh,3,Sat May 30 18:46:46 2015 UTC,"The economic calculation problem deals with both these arguments. An iterative calculation would not work as it has no method of collecting information about consumer preferences in a reasonable timeframe. In a market, an exchange signals that the price is lower than the consumer's perceived benefit. Planners must rely on small samples of polls to collect this information, collecting far too little information and at far too slow of a pace. Additionally, there is no incentive to tell the truth, as you are not giving up money in exchange for an item that you demand. Furthermore, planners would not be able to base their calculation off of existing prices, as a single production or consumption shock renders them inaccurate.  With regards to equilibrium, it is irrelevant that markets never reach equilibrium. Functioning markets at least tend towards the equilibrium price. Planned economies cannot even claim that, as they cannot efficiently collect preference information.  Empirically, you can examine the ongoing collapse of the Venezuelan economy. Additionally, you should read Hayek's The Road to Serfdom and Von Mises' Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth."
AskSocialScience,37vebg,RationalIgnorance,2,Sat May 30 21:00:26 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the long answer, I got a bit carried away.  ""adequate rebuttal to a centrally-planned/decentralized economy"" I am a bit confused by this sentence, a market economy is a decentralized method of organization and decision making as opposed to central planning, and the E.C.P. is an argument in favor of decentralized decision making.  The answer must entail some speculation as you don't provide a specific organizational alternative which we can compare market economies with. I will try to provide an argument for why the empirical evidence we have points towards semi-decentralized production planning being more efficient than central planning.  First, I don't know any example of a centrally planned economy that has performed well (measured on efficiency, productivity, or absolute wealth creation), whereas the semi-efficiency of markets becomes pretty clear from any trip to the frozen section of a super market.  With that aside, you could of course argue that we have yet to see any experiments with large scale central planning using modern IT which might make a difference for the E.C.P.  You could look to large multinational corporations though, which outsize small economies, as experiments with central planning. Some multinationals have functioned reasonably well under a large degree of centralization (although on average large companies have tried to move towards more decentralized structures for many decades). Organizational management literature identifies company characteristics which determine the need for local responsiveness versus global integration. For example an oil company producing and selling a single homogeneous commodity worldwide can be more centralized than an advertising firm, which needs to respond to differences in local tastes.  If centralized planning of a whole economy was more efficient than the market though, you would expect these large companies to try and get into every line of business imaginable. And they did for a while (empire-building in the literature), but the 80s came along with the infamous ""corporate raiders"" who bought and split up companies, having figured out that companies generally perform better when they focus on what they are best at.  If central planning was more efficient than markets, you would expect a country or corporation to use central planning across the board to out-compete everyone else. I don't see any evidence for this happening.  A centralized economy could create an internal pseudo market to replicate the efficiency of price signals, but if you combine that with a thorough incentive scheme you are pretty much right back at a market economy. This is in fact done by many corporations which have internal transfer pricing schemes to coordinate behavior and calculate the performance of departments, coupled with large portions of managers' pay based on performance.  The lack of iterative calculation being used to solve the problem of economic calculation anywhere supports the notion that it is probably not easy as your friend makes it sound. You could consider the whole of a market economy to be one big iterative calculation that is run dynamically across many 7 billion sub-calculators with prices and orders as variables and steps in the calculation, but that kind of destroys the meaning of the statement doesn't it?  A quick back of the envelope calculation show you that the problem of coordinating all economic activity of a whole nation cannot currently be solved by a single super computer: You would need to store and calculate information on the demand of every consumer for every good and service at at least one price for each, along with the cost to produce any of these goods at at least one quantity each. This needs to be done at every iteration, and of course the system must be constantly updated according to changes in production and consumer demands.   If all relations in the system are simple with no reversals, you might approach an efficient equilibrium with relatively few iterations, but as soon as you have dynamic effects and reversals, the number of iterations needed to approach such an equilibrium approaches infinity (as well as the number of ""equilibria"").   For example I would like a new set of a specific pair of shoes if the price dips to 30$. (Without any form of currency, e.g. goods credits in this hypothetical scenario, the problem becomes even harder as it becomes complicated to describe how much I want or need a particular item compared to all possible alternatives that production might be geared towards). The cost of producing the shoes is currently 35$ and the current production level is above the demand at that price. The computer tells the factory to produce less shoes, which causes the average price production to go up as there are scale advantages. However maybe it would have been more efficient for the computer to increase production, bringing the price down as it turns out that at 33$ everyone would want this one particular pair of shoes and suddenly demand would outstrip production. The total amount of information and decisions are unfathomable."

As an entrance, here's the wiki article on population decline, specifically the section on economic consequences.   Here's a report on a study that finds that improved standards of living lead to a decrease in the fertility rate.

If I had 10% of the money supply, and years later have 9% due to inflation, who now owns that 1%? If due to the multiplier effect, is that 1% now distributed between the banks?"
AskSocialScience,37qrsn,twiifm,5,Fri May 29 20:11:59 2015 UTC,"Hypothetia has major companies:  Draco: a company that holds 10 dollars in a big cash pile, and pays rent,  insurance, et cetera by charging a fee to people who want to look at it.   Primcorp: produces widgets by buying erwids  Ducorp: produces geters from widgets  Tricorp: produces erwids from geters.   Primcorp,  Ducorp and Tricorp all have 30 percent of the money supply, and own various amounts of bonds.   The central bank of Hypothetia purchases bonds at just barely above market value -  so many bonds, in fact,  that they're doubling the money supply.   Whoever owned the most bonds wins out slightly. They received more money than the bonds were worth, but just barely. On the whole their balance sheet is nudged up a little. They then use this money to buy stuff,  because that's what you do with money. Tricorp buys from Ducorp, which then uses that money to buy from primcorp,  and so on. After a while, it doesn't matter who had the most bonds / who received the most cash initially, because it all goes around in a cycle, and nothing has fundamentally changed. They all have about the same percentage of the money supply (just slightly favoring whoever owned more bonds initially).   But Dracocorp never bought or sold anything from the other three companies, so it didn't participate in the money flows,  and now it's lost out. It used to have 10%, but now it only has 5%. The other three companies used to have 30%, and now have 31.66% each.   In real life this is more complex, but the principle is the same: bondholders win a tiny amount from the initial expansion, the expansion effects active participants in the economy essentially across the board, but hoarded cash under the proverbial mattress loses value.  What's under the mattress? Well, literal piles of cash for one. Expansionary monetary policy hurts warlords sitting on pallets of 100 dollar bills. But also, my fixed rate loans might as well be piles of cash from the banks perspective. Things that aren't tied to productive assets are closest to being under the mattress."
AskSocialScience,37qrsn,twiifm,2,Fri May 29 20:59:19 2015 UTC,"No this is incorrect.  When the Central Bank ""prints money"" they don't buy corporate bonds they buy Treasuries.

That's why there is no inflation.  http://mmtwiki.org/wiki/Money,_Government_and_Banking  But your original question, it might help if you replaced ""money"" w ""asset.""  Let's say an economy of 100B money supply and you own 1B making you own 1% of all assets.  And you did nothing w that money.  In 10 years if the economy grew to 200B and you still own 1B because that money sat in a vault untouched.  The question where does that extra 100B go?  It goes to whoever acquired it.  Could be a bunch of other rich guys who created the next Google or Facebook.  How did they get money to create those companies?  Well they go to capital markets, and some of the money originated from bank loans.  If the banks already loaned out the max on their reserves where do the reserves come from?  It comes from the Central Bank creating it out of thin air."
AskSocialScience,37qrsn,twiifm,2,Sat May 30 01:41:03 2015 UTC,No you understand it incorrectly.  And its not multiplier effect.  When the Fed prints money and buys assets its a balance sheet operation between the Fed and the commercial bank.  Commercial banks have a reserve account at the Fed.  QE is a swap of assets for reserves.  There is no inflation because the money never entered the real economy.  Its sits on the balance sheet of commercial banks as reserves.  When banks create loans and you deposit that loan. That's when the money enters the real economy.  Its a bit hard to understand because you need to understand hierarchy of money.  There should be a pdf on this page that explains money creation  http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/quarterlybulletin/2014/qb14q1.aspx

Its not like banks get free money.  The idea is that banks withhold lending because they lack reserves.  QE is designed to swap bank assets (toxic assets like MBS) for reserves.  Its more tp deal with liquidity.  But QE is ineffective to create inflation if there are no quality borrowers.  Demand is simply not there while in recession"

And young people have much less power in our society and are often seen and treated as lesser than adults.  They are also forced to do many things against their will (attend school,  etc.)  So in a sense,  young people are bullied by society,  especially if they do not conform to society's wishes for them.   That kind of societal ""bullying"" can easily breed resentment and stress which is perhaps then being vented and released by bullying others online.

AskSocialScience,37lpjr,Sluggo57,1 point,Fri May 29 05:47:57 2015 UTC,"I've read The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind many times, and spent thousands of hours on independent research and my website which is primarily devoted to Jaynes' work. His ideas are mentioned in a wide variety of sources, some of them have to do with neuroscience, or psychology, but primarily philosophy- I think this is because most scholars have a knee-jerk reaction when they read a synopsis of the book and read no further, so the people in the scientific community that are interested in the theory are sort of afraid to be wrong essentially (Daniel Dennett mentions this when discussing the book). Also, most scholars tend to focus on culture, archaeology, or a specific aspect of psychology, and the theory itself is so all-encompassing because Jaynes was a brilliant polymath who covered a wide range of diverse fields in the book so many scholars will be afraid to comment on anything that they're not specifically trained in.      There are two primary criticisms of the theory that are fair and logical, one is that the theory itself is unprovable since the bicameral people are gone and the mind doesn't leave a distinct archaeological record. The counter to this, as I see it, is that you have to carefully examine the evidence provided in the book and ask yourself if chance could allow such a wide-range of phenomena to occur and be explained by a single cohesive theory. As I see it, it's mathematically impossible for all of these phenomena to be explained in this way, this is why there is no competing theory which can explain even half of the phenomena that Jaynes' explained.      The other criticism, which is probably more fair, is that if early man all over the world had this same mind state then people in uncontacted cultures today should still show signs of bicamerality. This is a more complex issue with no easy answer, but I'd say that even an expert on the theory would have trouble communicating about an issue like this with (previously) uncontacted peoples; I mean to say that most scholars aren't even familiar with the theory, an even smaller number has took the time to fully understand the theory and it's implications for a situation like this. I don't keep up with this sort of thing to be honest, but I would say that there probably aren't a whole lot of uncontacted groups today that are being examined up close, and even if there is it's not necessarily the case that the people would have remained bicameral. I believe the bicameral mind likely arose as the language circuits of the brain were developing, and communication requires two parties by nature, one speaks while the other listens- even today many people find it helpful to speak outloud to work out problems. Jaynes considered consciousness to be like a conceptual toolbox and not a single thing or function, so any group of people could essentially be anywhere on the spectrum of consciousness, and so could any individual, so to think ""there doesn't appear to be any bicameral people left on earth so the theory must not be true"" misses the point entirely. As I see it, the personal god was the prerequisite to the ego, man needs a master, and since communication by definition requires two parties man would naturally anthropomorphize the ""other"" as being a separate, higher creature, unknown and alien to the man.

The best you can do is compare the input/outputs of market economies and ""socialist"" economies. Generally, socialist countries have been way more inefficient when looking at input/output than capitalist countries but they were able to industrialize much quicker. The reasons for this is largely are debatable and highly contextual. I can recommend some reading if you want.   However, your question while ostensibly economic is more philosophical in nature.  For example you assume certain professions are inherently valuable while others are not. There isn't anything wrong with this assertion (though i wonder what would the hunter gatherer have to say about farming being intrinsically valuable, but that is not my point) but economics cannot answer what should or shouldn't be valuable. There is actually a lot of debate in economic philosophy on whether economics is becoming too autistic.     Inefficiencies will always exist because as a society and individuals we value things besides economic efficiency, what may be most efficient may also be morally reprehensible.    I see you say a lot of things about the ""free market"" The free market meme is more political rhetoric than an actually existing phenomena. We place restrictions on the market all the time, we just don't think about them or consider them normal, child labor, organ markets, vocational accreditation etc. Moreover, the state in (whether market or state) capitalist countries does invest in both  pure government research and in businesses it finds promising or vital to state interests."

The main author on political anthropology (the study of power relationships in small and very small societies) as far as I know was Pierre Clastres. I would recommend reading his studies on Guayaki indians of the Amazonian forest.  Clastres was a bit biased (in an anti-authoritarian way) but his analysis is that the basic tribal chief has very little power. He has to be able to speak well, settle small disputes and give presents to the members of his tribe. He would only take the role of a ""leader"" during conflicts with other tribes. But he could absolutely not force anyone to do his bidding.   So no, don't thing about force as a means to keep power. I would rather use Weber's typology of the types of power we obey to : traditional (kings, chiefs...), charismatic (dictators, war lords...), and legal-rational (nation states, administrative bureaucracies, etc)."
AskSocialScience,37kcor,Zenobist,1 point,Thu May 28 08:42:18 2015 UTC,"Great response, thanks! The ""powers we obey to"" you mentioned are all governments, a monopoly on violence, and operate solely from taxation. While taxes are usually spent to benefit the public, they are taken by force with violent consequences (jail or other forms of punishment) for not complying, otherwise they would be charitable donations.   While this represents modern authority, can we find similarities in the Guayaki tribal chief? He seems to represent the ""charismatic""small government: he holds little power, appeals to the masses (speaks well), works like a court (settle disputes), and gives presents (spends taxes). The primary difference here is where he gets the presents in the first place. Does the tribe voluntarily donate goods to him for being a helpful/respected individual? Or are they taken from the members (like taxes)? Also, if donated, are there societal pressures to shame those that don't participate (an act of aggression)?"
AskSocialScience,37kcor,Zenobist,1 point,Thu May 28 09:42:42 2015 UTC,"That's actually the core of Clastres' theory : small groups economics (few resources, not so many people) would mean that the chief never has enough gifts, which are given to him and expected to be given back. When I say Clastres is anti-authoritarian, it's because he considers that it is the chief that suffers from pressure, and that the second he refuses to give gifts, he is stripped of power and prestige.   He takes it even further saying that tribes such as the Guayaki make a conscious choice not to centralize power in order to remain free.  Thus, tribal chiefdom would be the anti thesis of the modern power relationship.

AskSocialScience,37gbkt,bobbyfiend,15,Wed May 27 13:41:55 2015 UTC,"This is a highly debated issue. One form of the ""catharsis"" hypothesis--the one that suggests emotional venting actually exerts a conditioning or practice effect making the reaction stronger and more likely in the future--might be phrased as the ""immediate passion"" version: immediate symbolic venting of your frustration through physical exertion and expression of your anger (e.g., screaming at a photograph or punching a poster) will reduce your overall anger. Yeah, that doesn't work.  There is, however, a subtly different take on the hypothesis: that a low but relatively constant level of symbolic violence can act as a ""preventative"" for real-world violence. Personally, I am still skeptical of this, but a pretty huge pile of evidence (some of it by this guy) can be seen as supporting this latter hypothesis--or at least very pointedly not supporting the idea that video games make people more violent, overall.  Some of his argumentation goes like this:   Way more people in developed nations spend way more of their time playing video games now than a few decades ago Levels of violence in these nations have, in general, actually gone down  If video games had any noticeable effect on violence, we should at the very least see some kind of positive correlation, between nations' acquisition of video game technology for the general population (and subsequent increase in gaming) and violence levels in said nations. Apparently, it doesn't happen.   Ferguson has applied the same reasoning to the ""moral panic"" arguments that pornography increases rape-proneness: if that were the case, the US and other developed nations should have seen massive explosions in rape as more and more people were connected to the internet through the '90s and '00s. But that didn't happen.  I think if you're going to argue the video games/violence connection, you have to deal with Ferguson's arguments (and those like him). I realize there is both correlational and experimental evidence suggesting such a link--but Ferguson has his own evidence (widely available), and some pretty pointed criticisms of both the contrary evidence available and the potential selection biases in how it got into the journals and the public consciousness."

The hypothesis is fairly simple. It's not incumbent on those who question it to show why the evidence doesn't support it; it's incumbent on those who propose the hypothesis to show how the evidence does support it.

You can read about some of the reasons here:  http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-left-party-strong-but-shunned-by-mainstream-a-922870.html  Another thing to consider is that, politically, the SPD and the CDU are really not so different---they are both centrist parties. Die Linke is not centrist. The Greens can be centrists on certain issues (just not environmental ones) so they can fit in well with CDU or SPD.   The new party AfD (Alternative für Deutschland) is a right-wing party which isn't in line with any other party---they are anti-EU, anti-Euro, etc., so they aren't going to be picked up as a coalition partner--not that it matters anyway since they got 0 seats in the last federal elections. They did, however, take votes away from the FPD which is (was?) another right-wing party (neo-liberal capitalists) but not crazy-right-wing and therefore a bit more palpable to the centrist CDU. The FPD also got 0 seats in the federal elections last round. So, without the FPD, the CDU didn't have much choice for a non-SPD coalition.

The SPD certainly is a centrist party but their brand is leaning left. Nevertheless, their actual policy has been leaning right for a long time now. Back in 2004 a lot of disappointed SPD members, mostly from western Germany, left the party to found the WASG, a ""true"" left alternative to the SPD. They were joined by a lot of union members, too, who historically always were in alliance with the SPD. In 2007 this smallish party united with the PDS which was basically the rebranded SED, the former governing party of East Germany, to found the party ""Die Linke"".   Soon after that, the SPD started badmouthing Die Linke, because they didn't want to lose votes to them. They used aggressive wording, calling them communists and questioning whether they even were a democratic party. (This is a big deal in Germany, because non-democratic partys may be banned.) Of course, the right partys joined in this campaign and soon the SPD was captured by their own narrative. Since Die Linke has only existed for eight yeras (and the SPD leadership lacks forsight and courage) they haven't dared to abandon this tactic up until now. It was probably still to early to engage in a three party, left leaning coalition.   One other thing: There are countries where it's perfectly normal for a minority to govern in parliament, but this has never been an option in Germany.

When employees get things they want, they feel appreciation and obligation toward the source providing benefits.

Detachment is a recovery state where employees mentally disengage from work, and replenish these resources (it sounds fuzzy, but this is the idea that working for 16 hours a day for a whole year isn't feasible because you have to get a break or you'll go crazy). link3 Lunch breaks and work-life balance have the common denominator of taking a break from work.  For lunch breaks, the direct research is very limited. This is probably the best paper you will find. But theory and longitudinal studies strongly suggest that recovery more broadly does contribute to well-being and performance. link. There are other papers on this as well. So to the extent you can link lunch breaks to recovery, a lot of this research should apply. One caveat is that we really don't know how long a break needs to be to replenish resources. Most of the daily studies on detachment examine recovery during leisure time after work, which is typically a few hours.   As for work-family balance, the research is surprisingly poorly-done and limited, in my opinion. This is probably the best resource you'll find on the topic. This is another good one. In a nutshell, the evidence is clear that better work-family balance is all around better for employees. It is not clear whether organization-level work-family initiatives improve firm level performance (e.g. profits).  Hopefully these links and the search terms will help you get started. One literature review shortcut is to find a recent dissertation on these topics and use that literature review.  As for what to tell the CEO, I would recommend keeping it simple. I think you'll get bonus points for providing example companies that are successful and implement lunch break/work-family balance policies. This is by no means a good basis to make decision, but it's how decisions often get made nonetheless.  Edit: I just remembered something, here are the only two papers I know of that directly examine work-family policies and organization-level performance link1 link2. Also just to clarify, it is worth separating individual employee-level performance and organization-level performance (due to the ecological fallacy).

Piracy could substitute for sales (negative effect) or act as free advertising or generate buzz (positive effect). There could also be zero effect if pirates would never have purchased in the first place.   Another complication is that even if music sales are harmed, artists could be helped if their concert or merchandise revenue rises. ""Hurt the economy"" here would mean having less music than we otherwise would have and that is pretty hard to determine.   A number of empirical studies have been done to try and determine what the effect is for sales, at least. Stan Liebowitz at UT Austin has a fairly thorough (though perhaps slanted) review. You can find it at   http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stan_Liebowitz/publication/23745956_Economists_Examine_File-Sharing_and_Music_Sales/links/02bfe5100b8bc6b1fc000000.pdf   He's quite critical of the Oberholzer-Gee & Strumpf paper, so maybe take his comments with a grain of salt.   You should also note that all these studies look at Napster-style file sharing; ie, not bit torrent. I am actually working on a paper that does and will have a draft soon, but it's obviously not peer -reviewed so you shouldn't really believe me... My main results suggest that file sharing decreases physical sales and increases digital sales, but the effects aren't huge."
AskSocialScience,379y8d,srs_jon_is_srs,5,Tue May 26 03:22:00 2015 UTC,"I would argue that it is close to a consensus in the literature that internet piracy has reduced sales. The Oberholzer & Strumpf paper is more or less the only one that finds a zero effect (I agree about Liebowitz being heavily biased, but I think his general reading of the literature is correct).   However, this is only one part of the equation. In order to evaluate the welfare impact of internet file sharing, we need to know how much consumer surplus is generated by the free availability of music. Not much work has been done on this to my knowledge, but one paper that does tackle this question is this one by Rob and Waldfogel. There are many problems with this approach (one of which is that the group studied is US college students, which are hardly representative), but their finding is that expenditures per capita fell by $25 but consumer surplus increased by $70 as a result of downloading. If this result holds for the general public, it means that illegal file sharing has been strongly welfare increasing.  Finally, we need to consider the dynamics. Even if it were true that file sharing was welfare increasing in the short run, it might be that decreased revenues would lead to a reduction in the quality or quantity of music being produced going forward. Joel Waldfogel has worked on this, in a paper finding evidence that the quality of music has not decreased since 1999, but rather, if anything, has been increasing. Again, there are of course huge problems caveats with this research, but it might at least be indicative.   To summarize, the evidence so far seems to strongly support the hypothesis that file sharing hurt music sales, at least in the first decade of the millennium (my guess is that streaming services have changed this). There's weak evidence, together with theoretical arguments, that indicate that consumer surplus might have increased enough to compensate for the drop in sales, and there's also weak evidence that quality of music hasn't been hurt.   You could furthermore make an argument that this development might have resulted in a lot of technical innovation, which might have positive spillover effects on the economy in general.  Finally, it's worth to remember that we don't necessarily care that much about the music industry. A very rough calculation using these numbers puts the recorded music industry at 0.02 percent of the world economy, and a similarly rough calculation using these numbers puts the music industry's employment share in the US in 2007 at, remarkably, 0.02 percent. This means that the music industry as such is fairly insignificant for the economy as a whole. Music, on the other hand, is incredibly important to human wellbeing - but we had music before we had a music industry."
AskSocialScience,379y8d,standard_error,5,Tue May 26 14:02:59 2015 UTC,"It's also important to note that ""having less music than we otherwise would have"" is a very abnormal metric for ""hurt the economy."" Spending that without piracy might have gone toward music is going toward some previously less-valued use, but that doesn't mean it's worse for the economy, and it very well could be better, depending on what we're measuring. Conditions have also changed; we're necessarily comparing (if implicitly) to the pre-Napster economy, and that's just not where we live."

It's not much different than being disgusted by any sort of sex you find appalling - that's an ok thing.  Homophobia is being actively aggressive - verbally or physically - because two men are socially together. That could be because of sexual preference and it really might be, but it's also dealing with a lot of gender roles and what's expected of men in society.

Additionally, the 4% estimate has been widely replicated, for example by the Williams Institute and, by interpolation, from US Census data on married couples. It is probably roughly correct.  I do not see any particular reason why older people would presently be less likely to come out than younger people. Indeed, the main reasons people are thought to stay closeted -- fear of punishment by parents, deprivation from family acceptance, and bullying by peers -- are less prevalent among older people who have established lives of their own.  Tolerance for people who are LGBTQ has increased across the board -- it is lowest among the old and the religious, but older generations' capacity to sanction their peers (ie bully them) is lowest, too. I see no reason to expect older people to be particularly closeted.  Surveyors work hard to find ways to identify LGBTQ people who may feel an incentive not to come out. The Williams Institute has a nice piece on it here . The challenges to identifying LGBTQ respondents are not unique to the elderly. It is a challenge for any sampling project."

AskSocialScience,375hhw,cos1ne,1 point,Mon May 25 15:29:51 2015 UTC,"See now you have to define homosexual. What is it?  Anyone who has ever been attracted to a same-sex individual? Then you include people who admire beauty but have no desire to actual act on that attraction.  Anyone who has ever engaged in same-sex behavior? Sexuality is more fluid than that as Kinsey reported in his studies. Someone may have had a one-off encounter in college and has no desires to return to that, do they count as homosexual for your report?  Anyone who has been in a same-sex relationship? Well that removes single homosexuals from your study.   I would argue that statistically people ""in the closet"" do not qualify as homosexual for general population measures. Because for me to be placed in that category a person must identify with it. So the idea that we must represent them as homosexual (why?) is wrong because they do not identify as such.  Looking at the Kinsey data it seems that homosexual activity has not been rising, only different sexual identities are increasing in number (since many such identities did not exist 30 years ago). So I would expect that getting data of sexual identity from a 60 year old, 40 year old and 20 year old is just as meaningful. There is no reason to weight your statistics towards a younger crowd because you feel they are ""more honest"" with their sexual identity."

I would argue that there are people in this world who've always known they were attracted to their same gender, and not the opposite yet married a member of the opposite gender anyway to look ""normal"".  To back up my points I should say the average age of coming out of the closet was much older than the average age of which one first got married. I apologize for only having data for men.  So do you think a more valid study would ask both ""have you ever had a same sex encounter"" and ""how do you define your sexuality"" ?"
AskSocialScience,375hhw,casualfactors,1 point,Mon May 25 16:39:47 2015 UTC,"who've always known they were attracted to their same gender, and not the opposite yet married a member of the opposite gender anyway to look ""normal"".   I would say that the number of people who are exclusively homosexual and married to an opposite sex partner are very few. Especially in this day and age, maybe twenty years ago it might raise the statistic a bit but it would still be within the margin of error I would wager.  I mean you have to have some level of attraction, whether emotional, physical or psychological in order to engage in sexual relations, so my view would be men who came out of the closet after being married weren't exclusively homosexual, but determined that they were less happy being in a permanent relationship with a woman than they would be with a man.   So do you think a more valid study would ask both ""have you ever had a same sex encounter"" and ""how do you define your sexuality"" ?   Honestly, I think the studies we have are accurate. Sexual identity is a very complicated thing, and its definitions are mostly arbitrary anyway. Especially considering the political ramifications it is unlikely we will ever have ""real"" numbers, or numbers which will satisfy every group agenda.   Your two questions would only give us data on incidental homosexuality and intrinsic homosexuality. That is all. Gay rights activists might want to embolden their numbers by claiming incidental homosexuals as ""gay"" while those individuals being claimed may not identify as gay (or even be opposed to being seen as such). On the other end anti-gay activists might use the much lower sexual identity statistics to downplay the societal impact of the gay community.   There are a few facts about sexual identity, the first is that it is up to individuals themselves to determine what their identity is. The second is that behavior does not dictate identity, since homosexual behavior has been around for centuries but a homosexual identity has only existed for around the past hundred years. Finally, sexual identity is a snapshot of a person's life not the entirety of their being. For the first few years of life we have no sexuality and after puberty we may fluctuate or be set in one identity. However, we do change and we can not predict what identity one may have in the future.   All that being said, I think the information we have on sexuality is accurate, inasmuch as it can be. So I guess the answer I have to your question is that a survey of young people would not provide a more valid estimate than a general population survey would provide."

AskSocialScience,375axq,Yonyod,6,Mon May 25 00:28:46 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to leave some choice quotes from Mussolini's The Political and Social Doctrine of Fascism.    And above all, Fascism, the more it considers and observes the future and the development of humanity quite apart from political considerations of the moment, believes neither in the possibility nor the utility of perpetual peace...war alone brings up to its highest tension all human energy and puts the stamp of nobility upon the peoples who have the courage to meet it.      [fascism]it denies that numbers alone can govern by means of a periodical consultation, and it affirms the immutable, beneficial, and fruitful inequality of mankind, which can never be permanently leveled through the mere operation of a mechanical process such as universal suffrage.       For Fascism, the growth of empire, that is to say the expansion of the nation, is an essential manifestation of vitality, and its opposite a sign of decadence. Peoples which are rising, or rising again after a period of decadence, are always Imperialist: any renunciation is a sign of decay and of death.      Thus a doctrine which is founded upon this harmful postulate of peace [pacifism] is hostile to Fascism.       [the fascist] rather conceives of life as duty and struggle and conquest...   Take these quotes as you will. The entire piece is worth reading, it's only a few pages long and embodies, in my opinion, the inner spirit of fascism. It can be found here.  EDIT: In line with /u/Natrounius's comment, I wanted to add in some other quotes to support his main point, that fascism sees the State as supreme and subservience to it as crucial.   The foundation of Fascism is the conception of the State, its character, its duty, and its aim. Fascism conceives of the State as an absolute, in comparison with which all individuals or groups are relative, only to be conceived of in their relation to the State.       The State, as conceived of and as created by Fascism, is a spiritual and moral fact in itself, since its political, juridical, and economic organization of the nation is a concrete thing: and such an organization must be in its origins and development a manifestation of the spirit.       It is the State which educates its citizens in civic virtue, gives them a consciousness of their mission and welds them into unity; harmonizing their various interests through justice, and transmitting to future generations the mental conquests of science, of art, of law and the solidarity of humanity.       The individual in the Fascist State is not annulled but rather multiplied, just in the same way that a soldier in a regiment is not diminished but rather increased by the number of his comrades. The Fascist State organizes the nation, but leaves a sufficient margin of liberty to the individual; the latter is deprived of all useless and possibly harmful freedom, but retains what is essential; the deciding power in this question cannot be the individual. but the State alone.    And finally, an especially interesting section where he discusses the idea of an ""ethical"" state, and contrasts it with democracy in such a way:   on the other hand, the Fascist State is itself conscious, and has itself a will and a personality-thus it may be called the ""ethic"" State."

Italy under Mussolini was the first fascist regime and certainly the one where fascism proper originated, and you won't really find anything of any ideological significance in Hitler's ramblings, so...I can't imagine there's any other type of fascism.  Though when trying to define fascism, I think that it is better to treat it not as its own ideology operating in an intellectual vacuum, but as a response to the rise of communism and socialism, the experience of WWI, and the seeming failures of liberal democracy. Mussolini addresses all of these in the piece I linked and discusses how fascism rose up to oppose them, to find a ""third way"" that was neither liberalism nor Marxism."

There is no end game for fascism, and therein lies what I percieve to be the critical failure of fascism and all totalitarianism, no change is predicted. Correct me if I'm wrong, but there has never been any expectation of change after fascist take over. At any sign of it, the government cracks down brutally creating even more instability.

This is /r/askSocialScience, we try to keep it professional and the mods do a good job of enforcing that!  The closest thing fascism had to an end game was the creation of a third way that opposed the dominant forces of the day, liberalism and fascism. Take Nazi Germany, for example. The Nazis first gained votes as the liberal Weimar Republic seemed to be failing, and socialism at home (in the form of political parties and labor movements) and abroad (in the form of the USSR and its ComIntern) seemed to be a growing problem. And while, contrary to popular belief, the Nazis didn't take power democratically or through any proper vote, what made them viable at all were the fears of the German population towards the weakness of liberalism and the threat of Marxism.   I agree with you that any fascist society is doomed to collapse quite quickly, for two reasons. First, of course, is the preoccupation with conflict and violent expansion, the social Darwinian view of the world, which leads to war and ruin. More importantly though, I think, is the lack of any unifying principle behind the whole thing, aside from some ad-hoc talk of the omnipotence of the State (Mussolini didn't even write the piece I linked until 1933, when some sort of ideological scaffolding was demanded). Liberalism has its roots in the works of Locke, Smith, Mill and so on, while Marxism had nearly a hundred years of tradition by then made up of Marx, Engels, Lenin and so on. Fascism simply didn't have that. As I mentioned, it was largely a reaction to what was going on around it, so fascists merely adopted the opposite positions of their opponents in many respects, or otherwise took on populist positions to promote themselves. The popular fear of Marxism at the time is the prime example: where Marxism pushed for gender equality and fought against religion, Nazis pushed for traditional gender roles and state-sanctioned religion. Where Marxism believed in class conflict, the fascists promoted corporatism, the cooperation between labor and capital for the greater good. Where Marxism (at least theoretically) promoted pacifism and internationalism, fascists stood for war and nationalism.   I think the context of the times is the most important thing to understand when looking at why fascism emerged. Liberalism, it seemed, had had its heyday, and the horror of WWI, followed by the Great Depression seemed to show it to be a fading ideology. Marxism, on the other hand, seemed like the next big thing, as the USSR avoided depression (albeit at the cost of millions of lives) and socialist parties around the world grew in strength. I would argue that fascism was the result of a world where it seemed like liberalism was failing and Marxism was replacing it--how else to stop it but by pursuing some third way, that avoids the weaknesses of liberalism while pushing back against Marxism? And that was fascism."

I'll have a look at the blog post when I have a chance, by the way, but it's awfully late here and I have to get to sleep soon.   To give my final thoughts, I think the lack of any moral or philosophical framework precludes fascism from ever being effective or ethical. It simply isn't consistent: whereas liberalism and Marxism are both built up from a set of philosophical and other assumptions proposed by their founders, fascism simply never had that. It's completely ad hoc as an ideology, and as far as I'm concerned, is nothing more than a historical curiosity."

The end goal of democracy is a bit more wobbly because by it's very nature it can go in many directions. Democracy is more of a tool to shape goverment other than an idealogy so, the left, right, and centrist can use democracy for any of their goals. The fascist process is to establish a fascist state, maintain the fascist state, and spread the facsist state with no real constructive goals. Does that make sense?"
AskSocialScience,375axq,Natrounius,1 point,Tue May 26 02:38:53 2015 UTC,"I would like to start of by stating that I possess a bias against fascism(as evident in a blog post I made on the subject of Nazism vs. Fascism seen here) However I do feel I can comment to some degree on the ethicality of Fascism.  One of Fascism's main principles is the individual subservience to the state, meaning that any sacrifice of the indivual that would benefit the state would be justifiable. Depending on the average person's ethics, this could lead to some very nasty situations. Such as the rounding up of opposition and the restriction of personal liberties. As Edgar Hardcastle (British socialist) asserts that both Russian Communism's and German and Italian Fascism's have the goal to ""to destroy all opposition parties if he gets power"" source. The destruction of liberty is hardly ethical, in my opinion anyway. A Fascist state could alleviate some issues through the ""bread and circuses"" method and the focus on militarism would allow for increased employment, however these would still create a wealth distribution similar to that in any capitalist democracy. Ideas such as ""Volkisch equality"" could be seen as benevolent in theory, but in practice they are far from it. Therefore a non-racist/ non-homo/xenophobic fascist state is possible, but one that qualifies as ""ethical"" or even ""benevolent"" (being incredibly subjective and not really the place of social scientists, but rather philosophers) would be nearly impossible to most people's interpretations of the words."

The need to ban groups for their ideas seems rather barbaric and denotes a level of corruption and self doubt of the ruling class. If you are in the right and doing the best for your people, what is there to fear? Establishing a one party system only succeeds in pushing the opposition underground and closer to open revolt and subversion. So if it were able to cut the head off of a potential civil war, then I think the ethicality of the revolt itself is inquestion. Civil wars are indeed horrible, but start for reasons that need to be addressed and destroying a faction wouldn't come close to solving the problems the faction thought they could solve through violence.   I also tend to think that an overabundance of nationalism by it's very nature differentiates between nationals and non-nationals and once this distinction is made conflict may arise.   Fascism's worship of the state and its military are also worrisome, a state's nature is to serve it's people and eventually a government, no matter how benevolent in meaning will eventually topple in on itself via the alienation of its own citizenry."

Uneducated people unaware of the benefits of the system may try to revert back to what they once had, which is why it's okay for Cuba to jail dissidents and restrict the press. I don't necessarily agree, but it's a compelling line of thinking. In addition, malevolent forces may often influence people to overthrow the regime that helps them.  Do you believe fascism can exist without this kind of repression? Can there be a political party in a democracy that operates through fascism without restricting the rights of dissidents?      Does nationalism need to be exclusionary? I think that the US is a very nationalist country, but is (in principle) non-exclusionary. A Punjabi, a Quechua, a Frenchman, or a Papuan can all become Americans. That being said, jus soli may perpetuate ethnic nationalism by giving an unfair advantage to people whose parents are citizens, because Punjabis and Papuans are unlikely to have American parents.  Also, could fascism be considered a non-liberal (or non-Westphalian?) view of the state? If the goal of a state is not to serve the people, but instead to promote the people. I'd argue that this is the main motivation of American Exceptionalism, a troublesome principle that no American politician, regardless of party affiliation, can hope to criticize.   Also, how do you believe fascist military worship relates to Marxist-Leninist military worship and traditional premodern military worship exhibited today through the modern image of ""noble knights"" and benevolent warriors like Frodo or Aragon?"

However, rural flight definitely has negative economic repercussions on small towns and communities. My question is this: how can declining rural communities interested in retaining or rebuilding their population effectively attract newcomers?   Suppose, for purposes of this little exercise, that a Midwestern or Southern town in the United States, with a population of about 5K to 15K, has seen a steady decline in population of its young to larger cities (rural Brain Drain, if you will). What can that small town (no doubt interested in the even more rural folks who live near that town, and who use it for groceries, shopping, entertainment and the like) do to prevent a complete economic decline?  I guess what I'm wondering is this: What can rural communities and small towns (who have an interest in retaining a populace for economic reasons) do to ensure growth--economic and otherwise?  What is wise policy for, say, the mayor or town council of declining small towns and rural communities to avoid becoming a derelict ghost town and instead see economic growth and increased well-being of its citizens?  I'm not assuming rural de-population is bad. Rather, I'm assuming that there are people in these rural communities whose best interest would be the growth of their town, an increased standard of living, and not only a steady population but also steady population growth. And I'm wondering if there's any scholarship that would suggest ways of achieving those ends.   But, again, I don't think I've taken a value position concerning rural de-population's goodness or badness."

There is no way a small town will provide the job, educational, and entertainment opportunities that a large urban center can. As the cost of moving out decreases thanks to better/cheaper access to information and bolts, and the opportunity cost of staying increases, people will move out.

Then it depends... the thing you need to know is that those with degrees from these schools don't necessarily become economists. In fact econ majors from most schools don't become economists. It's simply a numbers game: about 30% of our graduating class majored in econ (some as a sole major and some as part of a double major). That's hundreds of students, multiplied by hundreds of schools- there's no place in graduate school for all those people, and a graduate PhD is necessary to become a hardcore economist.  I think you might be talking about graduate programs, in which case I am a bit out of my expertise. But I imagine the trend from undergrad must hold. A PhD in econ opens you up to fields like consulting, finance, business analysis, etc, so it probably depends on what you decide to do with your econ degree.   My econ TA (at a top school) was interviewing with places like FRED and the BLS, but I suppose that a few economists end up at the CBO/in politics."

Look at the freaking data - being an econ major is not any more helpful in getting into finance than being a women's studies major. The head of the undergrad econ major at my school actually makes a strong effort to dispel this myth (I imagine econ professors here are pretty pissed having to deal with superficial people who don't actually care about econ).

Honestly, most finance jobs have very few technical skills. You are mainly just calling people and entering things into a computer program that someone way more qualified devised. Business school, where finance degrees are housed, are about networking, not knowledge (primarily. you still learn a lot in B-schools to be fair). So utimately, it is the drive, stamina, and overarchieving that is more valuable to an investment bank, and although these types of students are found at all universities, in terms of probabilities, they are more likely to be found in a top school.

Lloyd Blankfein was a history major, for instance. And they view this as a source of prestige. They're not just getting finance-minded kids but they're getting the smartest kids from all fields. That lets them broaden their intellectual inputs. A history major might have different perspectives on a trading desk than an econ major.""  Additional statistics: in 2009, 50% of Harvard students went into finance (I'd venture to say that's no where near the number of econ majors). In 2014, 70% of Harvard students applied to a Wall Street job (suggest heavy recruiting efforts, but may also be due to self-selection bias to be fair).   Keep in mind my entire argument is based on an undergrad education. Grad school is different. You will most likely be paid well as an economist no matter where you get your PhD (the econ labor market is actually regulated very well by the American Economic Association e.g. they monitor the job market so that PhD programs don't accept too many students, which would push down wages). In other words, the prestige of your PhD program is more for those trying to become academics at prestigious schools than for those who are going into industry. And the BSL salary you are looking at are for PhDs, not for undergrads. Having an econ BA will not get you labeled ""economist"" anywhere in America."
AskSocialScience,3712ec,Vladith,148,Sat May 23 21:41:40 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to the Nazis, but I can speak to the topic of ISIS and other terrorist organizations. Essentially by comparison, ISIS is a very strange case in the study of terrorism. Most terrorist organizations in the past have acted with a lot more restraint, and they are extraordinarily unusual in that regard.  So to explain what I mean by that, we first should take a look at what terrorist organizations usually do. Typically speaking, terrorists have a certain ""threshold of violence"". They seek to kill to gain attention, but have to balance this with the difficult task of not drawing the ire of those they're killing on them. Surprisingly enough, a terrorist organization's goal is not usually to kill as many people as possible: it is to show success and the ability to kill, but also maintain a certain level of popularity among the population whose ideals it seeks to sway. This is the battle for the ""hearts and minds"" that you'll often hear about. If the IRA killed too many people in a bombing, especially people who were potential recruits (potential in the sense that they might've sympathized), they obviously create more troubles for themselves down the road. This is fairly straightforward, but it's also important. It explains the calculated levels of brutality that many terrorist organizations typically show.  When you talk to experts about ISIS, as the RAND Corporation did, they frequently express some level of surprise at its operation and style. Take, for example, the burning alive of the Jordanian pilot that occurred. Most experts are perplexed to some extent at the way ISIS makes value judgments on an action like that. Some examples of what those experts said:   I can't recall a single incident in modern terrorism where terrorists deliberately killed a hostage with fire. There's no religious basis for it this side of 17th-century witch burning. The sole purpose is terror. It will enrage some in Islam.   Also:   ISIS has publicized its brutality to attract the most determined and inevitably those most prone to violence. These recruits now comprise a large portion of the total number of fighters, enough to begin to change the character of the organization. The brutalization, through self-selection of volunteers and continued fighting, produces a subculture in which the norms of violence are skewed, allowing—even commanding—ever-greater acts of violence.   And:   Brian raises a very interesting point: Perhaps ISIS is deliberately ignoring Islamic norms, precisely so it can attract violent killers like the British executioner featured in several of its beheading videos. For recruits like these, issues of theology are virtually meaningless.   What has become increasingly clear is that ISIS is unique in that it doesn't care about this threshold of brutality. Many analysts today are arguing that it isn't so much looking for recruits on the basis of appealing to the general population, but rather by appealing to the millenarian (apocalyptic) prophecies some believe in. They argue that it's essentially ""strip-mining"" its territory, fueling a war machine that can only be kept running by expansion (similar, actually, to what some say the Nazis were doing with their military expansion). Some of this debate is alluded to in this recent Politico Magazine piece criticizing President Obama's strategy against ISIS. The piece lays out what appears to be the broad outlines of ISIS strategy. And RAND experts wrote on its recruitment strategy as well:   ISIS distinguishes itself from other jihadist groups by publicizing its seemingly limitless violence. This attracts a self-selecting group of individuals who are not repelled by graphic images of mass executions, beheadings, crucifixions and burnings — and who may actually be attracted by the opportunity to participate in such atrocities.   This is, as I said, not typical. There are numerous people who have documented actions by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, for example, that demonstrate how atypical this is. Thomas Hegghamer, in Jihad in Saudi Arabia, documents how this worked. Discussing an attack where two suicide bombers drove an explosives-filled van into a residential compound (killing 17) in November 2003, Hegghammer writes:   ...the Muhayya operation turned out to be a public-relations disaster for the militants. Most of the casualties were Arabs and Muslims, many of them children, and the attack happened during Ramadan, the holy month of fasting. By all accounts, the militants did not realize that the compound housed mainly Arabs; in their statements, the QAP [Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula] insisted that the government media were lying about the casualties being Arabs and Muslim. Muhayya was widely considered a turning point in the campaign because it shifted public opinion firmly against the militants.   That is the perfect example of how there are typically restraints on terrorist actions. They want attention, a lightning rod, but it has to be the right one. For ISIS to go around killing in a way inconsistent with most of the Muslim world's interpretation of Islam (and which ignores the entirety of how Muslim law changes over time), killing Muslims themselves in such brazen fashion, is a risky thing. Some believe it will ultimately lead to their downfall, as the war machine can only sustain itself for so long, and they will fade into a regular guerrilla group over time. How long is uncertain: estimates that used to say about three years now suggest three years is the minimum of how long defeating it will take, with current strategy remaining constant.  ISIS is not necessarily appealing to the ""true path"", therefore. They are also appealing to the brutality of some people, and calling them from all over the world to join them. They are appealing to the ignorance of others, who believe that they are finally seeing a true interpretation of Islam that they had been misled about for so long, and which they too must follow. And finally, they're appealing to the millenarian, to the prophetic who believe the end of days is coming and will be heralded by those who join ISIS.  Hopefully that helps. Stephen Maurer's WMD Terrorism talks about the evolution of terrorism in the first chapter or two, and then moves into how WMDs could or couldn't be used against the United States, what must be done to stop them, etc., and what difficulties mean WMDs are less likely to be used. There are plenty of histories of terrorism you can look at as well, so let me know if you want to look at them. While some authors talk about the Taliban being brutal (like Walter Laqueur in The New Terrorism), it is clear these authors are probably amazed by ISIS today by comparison."

I don't know enough to speculate as to whether their goal is to invade Iraq with an army, or to say what their real goal is (I don't think anyone can really say), but I can say that it's perfectly possible and probably true that their stated goals are different from their real ones. They would be taking a page out of Al Qaeda's book, of course. AQAP was constantly preaching about ""removing the Crusaders"", referring to all foreign troops on Saudi Arabian soil. This was their cause, their public declaration as to what they wanted. However, it is clear that this was not what the upper echelons spoke about. While obviously removing ""the Crusaders"" was part of their cause, one of their biggest goals was to ultimately topple the Saudi Arabian monarchy.  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, for example, allegedly told investigators that Bin Laden's goal was to start a revolution to remove the monarchy in Saudi Arabia. Many former AQAP higher-ups who have been captured have said things to that effect, often to their cellmates, talking about how the monarchy is illegitimate. AQAP went for a two-step approach, where they would rile up a campaign against ""the Crusaders"", and then harness that energy to turn the masses against the Al Saud family. But new recruits and lower-level operatives didn't know this, and almost all of them joined to fight the Americans. It wasn't their intent to get caught up in trying to topple the kingdom.  In this case, ISIS is claiming to want a restoration of ""true Islam"", despite the fact that what they practice is a gross perversion of Islam. Their talk of restoring the caliphate appeals to the idea of prophecy, and religion, but that is not their actual goal. That is merely how they appeal to others. If I had to take a guess, their goal is to topple the Arab monarchies and seize power for themselves (a goal of most groups and organizations anywhere, really). Indeed, there have been many reports that note this goal, and note that it isn't Israel they'll be going for, or even the US, first. For example, Haaretz (the author of the article being a PhD in Middle Eastern History) reported on the idea, quoting ISIS' Twitter account:   We haven’t given orders to kill the Israelis and the Jews. The war against the nearer enemy, those who rebel against the faith, is more important. Allah commands us in the Koran to fight the hypocrites, because they are much more dangerous than those who are fundamentally heretics.   ISIS sees them all as heretics. But they don't necessarily care about them being ""heretics"", though that is a good way to get rid of them. What they likely care about is that they are places where these ISIS leaders can succeed and gain wealth, power, and more."

Looking at Al Qaeda in Iraq or in their operations in Pakistan the past ten years do I see any restraint, other than the small snippet you provided. Same in the Caucasus where we saw a bomb go off in the 2013 Volgograd bombings.

Economists' near-universal support of free trade is rooted in the logic of the law of comparative advantage. The large advances in the standard of living for most people in the world over the last fifty years is largely attributable to trade liberalization -- as such, most economists see the reduction in trade barriers as one of the great humanitarian achievements of the last century, without hyperbole.   Now, about TPP: Many economists support TPP as a trade deal. But there is some dissent -- most notably from Paul Krugman. Krugman's thoughts on the matter are interesting for a number of reasons. First, Krugman is unashamedly left-wing and quite vocal about it. Second, he is one of the most important trade theorists of all time; the number of people on the planet who know more about trade than Krugman is very small. Third, his position is reasonable and nuanced:  Krugman objects to the secrecy surrounding the bill, as described by /u/Matti_Matti_Matti. Furthermore, he argues that most of the gains from trade have mostly been realized, so any benefits are likely to be very small. Finally, he worries  that the deal isn't really about trade.

The common argument in favor of TPP/TTIP is that although tariffs have been all but abolished, NTB elimination will cause a considerable increase in trans-pacific/atlantic trade.   I'm not a trade theorist, but the default among most economists is that trade barriers of all kinds should be eliminated. But I believe Krugman when he says that most of the gains from trade have already been realized, so I guess I'm indifferent now.    How do you feel that Krugman's argument that there is a global demand deficit fits into this, and how true is the statement that there is a global demand deficit?   I don't think it really does fit into this. Krugman's AD shortfall story is about the business cycle, and trade policy isn't a viable way to control aggregate fluctuations. As for the truth about the ""demand deficit,"" well, that's a whole 'nother can of worms. It probably deserves its own thread."

AskSocialScience,36xyjg,QuickestDickAround,2,Sat May 23 16:42:37 2015 UTC,"I think you've hit the nail on the head: even liberals aren't anti-trade, it's just the secrecy and corporate support for the treaty that makes people worry that this is not about free trade, but simply about making the global economy better for large corporations.   It's also important to point out that even the most pro free-trade econ professor would acknowledge that free trade between countries creates winners and losers in both societies.   In basic terms, free trade incentivizes capitalists (from a relatively rich country like the US) to invest in a country where their dollar will buy more labor. This is a win for the capitalists, but laborers in a capital-rich country will now be forced to compete with the laborers in capital-poor countries, generally lowering their income and standard of living. That's why left-leaning politicians in the United States, who are somewhat beholden to unions (organizations of laborers) generally oppose NAFTA, the TPP, and other measures that promote ""free trade"" but don't do anything to make sure that American laborers can still compete in the international market."

I'm kind of treading water in this thread waiting for a trade economists to come in with some references to empirical work.   But as I also say below, there are profound distributional effects that must be considered. I am very willing to believe that NAFTA has directly increased income inequality in Mexico, and I am willing to entertain the idea that trade has increased the misery of the most vulnerable Mexicans. I would need to see convincing evidence in the form a well-identified, careful empirical analysis that may or may not exist.   There are other possible effects. Institutional changes that arise from increasing inequality, environmental degradation, migration effects, etc. These are even more difficult to identify in the data. While I believe that these are important factors, I would be extremely skeptical of any anecdotal evidence in their favor -- there's just too much going on to attribute causality to any one factor."

We went through this during the Bush years with the ICC - people generally don't like the idea that their government is being usurped by the ""New World Order"". Less rhetorically, it concerns me that corporations, who already have financial resources matching those of many nation states, are having even fewer checks on their power and privileged. From a constitutional law point of view, does the TPP pull an end run around SCOTUS? It's these legal questions that really bother me about TPP (or at least, what we've heard about it).  From an econ standpoint, I tend to follow Krugman's analysis that this will hurt the poorer nations more than the US and TPP nations, especially on the pharmaceuticals front."
AskSocialScience,36xyjg,QuickestDickAround,11,Sat May 23 13:59:30 2015 UTC,"Alright, here goes the second try:  TPP is not necessarily creating any sort of transnational tribunal. This statement is inaccurate for a couple of reasons. The first reason is that tribunals for the resolution of investment disputes between foreign investors and States have been around for - off the top of my head - fifty years. We'll go into the history in a couple of paragraphs. The second reason is closely linked to the first, and it concerns the word ""creates"".   TPP will contain an investment protection clause. If it ends up otherwise, that will be a great surprise. This is because 'investment protection' (we will cover what this means later) is an established policy of the US Commissioner for Trade, and has been so for a long time. The United States has an extensive network of bilateral and multilateral investment treaties. In the TPP's great sister treaty, TTIP (the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership), the United States are aggressively pushing towards the inclusion of an investment chapter. The European Commission's push towards an updated investment protection regime (more on this later) has been met with great American resistance. The US want investment protection clauses. If they say otherwise at home, that's domestic politics, and from my international legal background, irrelevant and unlikely to be indicative of a real change in position for various reasons.  Why did I say earlier that the word ""create"" was inaccurate? Because the regime of investment protection is a well-established (though developing) field of international law, governed by various as-good-as-global treaties, with its own customary international law and practice. TPP isn't creating anything new, it's merely going to declare that this regime now applies between the contracting States.  So what is investment protection? Let's take a short look at the established narrative for its creation. In the 1960s and 1970s decolonialization, the threat of communism (to wealthy investors), the rise of political dictatorships, independence movements and other sources of upheaval created an environment in developing countries that, so they say, was scaring off foreign direct investment (FDI). The weak rule of law in developing nations, widespread corruption, political instability created a climate where investors from capital-exporting states were uneasy about the prospect of investing in unstable states. Because foreign investment in developing nations can be very lucrative for investors, while creating beneficial economic activity in host states, a creative legal solution was found in order to create an environment which was more favorable to FDI.   A BIT (bilateral investment treaty) is a treaty between two states, which extends certain substantive and procedural protections to foreign investors from one state (the parent state) to the other (the host state). Here it's important to note that up to the late 1990s investment flows were very one-sided. Though a BIT's language implies that both contracting states are equal, in practice, the protections realistically only extended to the nationals of the capital-exporting state, simply because the capital-importing state's citizens weren't doing any real invesment otherwise. How many Bangladeshi firms do you think operate sizable businesses in the US? And vice-versa?  The essence of an investment treaty, however, isn't that it confers certain rights and protections to investors. The Soviet constitution offered Soviet citizens far-reaching freedoms, rights and entitlements, and went much farther than the US constitution. However, the factual situation in the country was very different. What I mean to say is that it doesn't matter what your rights are on paper. Your rights are only worth something if they are enforced. If a court system is corrupt, or if the executive branch is corrupt or unwilling, then your rights are worth nothing. An investor's only recourse, traditionally, would have been to resort to diplomatic protection from her home country's diplomatic corps. You can imagine that this was a slow process, and one subject to the rapidly changing diplomatic realities and necessities of the moment.  The common narrative is that we needed to create an alternative forum for the resolution of investment disputes. It is this alternative forum that is the defining feature of international investment law, and it's called ISDS (Investor-State Dispute Settlement). Before we go into a discussion of how ISDS works, it's important to realize that it does have real benefits, and that all Western economies have profited from its existance. It is a legal mechanism that was called into existance for a real reason, and the goals it serves are not necessarily evil. The mechanism requires honing, work, more transparency, a better system for the selection of adjudicators, but an alternative forum for the settlement of investment disputes is not necessarily a bad idea. It may ease the burden on national legal systems, reduce the amount of frivolous lawsuits domestically. However, as it exists now, it is very flawed.  I need to go to a dinner party now but I'll finish up later tonight."
AskSocialScience,36xyjg,graphictruth,9,Sat May 23 17:22:40 2015 UTC,"Okay, let's continue. The dinner party was great, by the way, thanks for asking.  Let's move on to a more in-depth discussion of the investor-State dispute settlement mechanism. ISDS is the part of investment law that usually gets all the flak. It's not uncommon to hear it be referred to as ""corporate sovereignty"", ""detrimental to states' sovereignty"", or another popular one: ""a neoliberal supraconstitution to rule the world"". But why do respected authors and knowledgeable scholars say these kinds of things? The substantive and procedural protections in BITs and their multilateral brothers and sisters are well-established in pretty much all legal systems around the world, and are really about as uncontroversial as any type of rule can be. Non-discrimination, the prohibition of expropriation and the right to due process are staples of domestic private and public law, and the rights to national treatment and most-favored nation treatment are just as uncontroversial in the international legal sphere. As I said earlier, it's the mechanism for the adjudication (or arbitration, or resolution) of legal disputes that draws all the attention.  ISDS gives foreign investors who believe that their rights have been infringed upon the right to directly - that means without going through their own government - 'sue' the host country under international law. I italicized ""under international law"" because anyone can sue a state under domestic law, which is so obvious that it feels strange to type out. The international forum is what makes this type of procedure special! The interesting thing is that in theory, all international legal procedures are consensual. That's why we don't call it a lawsuit, but an arbitration. In theory, it's voluntary. But why do writers in the media speak of suing?  The way that this works goes as follows: when a State signs an investment treaty, or any other type of treaty containing an investment chapter - the European Energy Charter Treaty is not necessarily a heavily investment-oriented treaty, but it is the one which has served as the basis for the most investment arbitrations to date - it consents to all future arbitrations brought by investors from the state that it is contracting with. That's a big justification for ISDS! State consent legitimizes the entire process, because it is voluntary and because it was given in an informed way. This is how we legitimize all international law, and it is essential to the functioning of many transnational and international institutions. Don't underestimate the power of this argument! This consent includes a reference to the arbitration rules that will be applied, which means that investment treaties refer to (for example) the ICSID conventions (wiki page for a quick primer) or the UNCITRAL rules (full text so you can get an idea of what kind of stuff is in these treaties).  These sets of rules contain procedural rules, rules for the choosing of arbitrators, rules for enforcement of final awards, et cetera. The thing is, however, that investment treaty arbitration (ITA) doesn't really provide for any fixed institutional structure. This is intentional, because ITA is meant to be a flexible, ad-hoc mechanism, that is quick-moving and that reaches satisfactory results. A fixed institutional structure was thought to be destructive to these goals - ITA was to be as flexible a tool as possible. To add to this flexibility, the treaties' language was purposefully made as open-textured as possible, to allow application to most of the diverse situations from which investment disputes could arise. To give you an idea, check out the provision on expropriation in the US Model BIT  (article 6, p. 8). Nowhere is the core concept defined! More on this later.  So we have loads of flexibility in the system. Investors and States can decide on the rules to be applied, they choose the arbitrators themselves, they get to decide which information becomes public and which is kept confidential. Arbitrators, on the other hand, also get lots of flexibility. The open texture of the treaties' language allows for great arbitral flexibility in the interpretation and reading of the provisions. The treaties do not give guidance as to which tests are to be applied to decide whether a rule has been broken, nor do they give guidance on interpretative techniques. Essentially, the approach to much of investment law is ""I know it when I see it.""  And this isn't even as unfair as it sounds....  More later, I need to go see a friend."

AskSocialScience,36xyjg,smurfyjenkins,2,Sun May 24 00:18:47 2015 UTC,"If it's not about free trade, then at what level is it ostensibly about free trade?   As you'll pick up elsewhere in this thread, it's the difference in free trade of goods (eg lower or remove tariffs to promote trade activities) and ""free trade"" of allowing capital (eg cash) to move. There are many subtleties in what that means at an econ theory level that I'm only aware of, but not in a position to detail their subtleties.  I can say that the rhetoric employed by those most vocally against TPP (both from the Sanders camp and the Tea Party camp) in my view conflates the issue - Sanders rails against TPP trying to make it easier to move US jobs overseas, but as others have mentioned, that happened decades ago. More nuanced critics of TPP, especially from the Warren camp, acknowledge this and argue against TPP from the view that it makes powerful corporations even more powerful. While Warren is the first to acknowledge that corporations are in and of themselves neither good nor bad, she and the progressive liberal wing of the Democratic party argue (with not insignificant support from some well respected economists, of whom Krugman is the most vocal) that corporations as they are practiced today (especially in the finance sector) cause significant harms to the populace in general, compared to where they could be if a stricter regulatory scheme were in place.  Wow, I should edit that last sentence, but my fiancee is pulling me off the couch to help with some gardening."
AskSocialScience,36xyjg,Manfromporlock,6,Sun May 24 14:12:00 2015 UTC,"/u/aq12wsxcd/ gave you the econ professor perspective, so here's what one might call the ""econ skeptic"" perspective.  Basically, economists are right in that free trade in goods is great. But we've had that--and the benefits that come with it--since the 1970s. [EDIT: ""We"" as in ""we in the west."" The spread of trade in goods to places that we didn't trade with, and in cases like China barely had contact with, back then does in fact explain much of the rise in global living standards since]. Modern trade agreements are much more about free trade in capital. It's the difference between paying for Chinese electronics with pork (that's fine!) and paying for them with the ownership of Smithfield.  This doesn't have compelling theoretical support--comparative advantage, for instance, simply assumes that capital won't be sent overseas. So bringing it up to defend trade agreements that are all about sending capital overseas is neither here nor there.  It also doesn't have good results in practice. Economists, after all, were 100% convinced that NAFTA (the first of the modern ""trade"" agreements, which is to say, investment agreements) would be great for Mexico. There was far more consensus than today, where Krugman isn't the only dissident, or even the only one with a Nobel Prize. That was as close as econ comes to a falsifiable prediction. How did it work out? Today wages in Mexico are lower than in China (which restricts capital movements), and Mexico has teetered on the edge of becoming a failed state.   So NAFTA shows us that either freeing up investment capital is not in fact a great idea, or that the effects are good but minor enough that they get swamped by other things. It also shows us that the simple fact that economists agree on trade doesn't mean they're right.   So why the urgency? Why do we have to ""fast track"" trade treaties? With other treaties, we get a chance to think about them, amend them, and so on. Why do trade treaties specifically have to get an up-or-down vote right away?  Well, the obvious answer is that if we actually saw what was in the treaty and had a chance to think about it we would reject it or demand major changes. Because there's a lot of stuff in there (as there has been in previous treaties) that powerful interest want but can't get through the normal democratic process. And they can't get it through, not because we're idiots who don't understand economics, but because they're very bad ideas.   I wrote a comic explaining it here. It's long."
AskSocialScience,36xyjg,smurfyjenkins,4,Sat May 23 13:39:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this reply. I'd like to respond to a few things, but conversations about trade usually become acrimonious for some reason. As you point out in the comic it's often the econ side who takes the ""holier than thou"" approach to these conversations, so let me just say up front that you seem to be well informed (moreso than myself, in fact) and I respect your opinion.   This doesn't have compelling theoretical support--comparative advantage, for instance, simply assumes that capital won't be sent overseas. So bringing it up to defend trade agreements that are all about sending capital overseas is neither here nor there.   I hesitate to call comparative advantage a ""theory"" more than a point of logic that is often applicable to certain theories. Trade theories that rely on comparative advantage (like Heckscher-Ohlin) really aren't used anymore because they perform so poorly when you take them to the data.   But you are right that traditional ""trade"" theories are really only concerned with goods. Capital flows are generally dealt with in a different field: International finance. While you are wrong to say that there is ""no compelling theory"" behind capital movements, I am entirely unqualified to discuss international finance as it is a field I know nothing about. But it exists, and smart people do it.    That was as close as econ comes to a falsifiable prediction.   This is a weird statement. 90% of economists deal exclusively in falsification -- we are Popperian to a fault. This can be confirmed by looking at (almost) any journal. Economists are obsessed with falsification.   That being said -- some effects are very difficult to establish empirically. The effects of NAFTA are clearly an example of this. A single policy that was rolled out over many years is very difficult to study. Specifically, there are many other confounding factors that occur simultaneously within a country, so isolating the effects of a single policy is very difficult, and often impossible. I am not a trade economist, so I can't tell you what empirical studies have been done or how well identified their estimates are. But ""blind faith"" is not something that economists are particularly fond of, especially as a group (go to an economics seminar sometime -- it can be brutal).  This brings me to a broader point about trade. While most economists do favor trade liberalization, we are very aware of the distributional effects that free trade can have. If you look over the IGM survey I linked to earlier, you'll see that most of the optional comments are about the distributional effects. (Udry has a typical response: ""This needs more nuance: most people win, and the winners gain a lot. But there are losers from trade who have not in fact been compensated."")  The distributional effects of trade liberalization are an integral part of modern trade theories, and there has been much empirical work on this subject in recent years. Here is one recent example (pdf) that deals specifically with Mexico. And note the identification strategy -- the analysis depends on a discrete change in trade conditions; this strategy could not be utilized to study NAFTA. Results like this are not atypical.  I guess my point is this: If you are concerned with capital controls and distributional effects, it would behoove you to engage the economics literature. There are entire fields and journals devoted to these very issues -- it is wrong and unproductive to suggest that economists haven't thought about these issues or simply ignore them."

Well, the obvious answer is that if we actually saw what was in the treaty and had a chance to think about it we would reject it or demand major changes. Because there's a lot of stuff in there (as there has been in previous treaties) that powerful interest want but can't get through the normal democratic process.

The good news though is that they're closely linked fields. Communication studies is pretty young and it's only been in the last ~40ish years that has begun to really develop on its own.

""Prices"" would have been better.   true. but the whole point of any value theory is to explain prices. Marxism does admittedly enter problems here, but the marginal theory does so more. It's circular insofar subjective preference (and marginal utility more generally) can only be identified in reference to price. This result in explain value via price when value is supposed to explain price. The cost-benefit analysis necessary to marginal value can only operate with a 'cost'.   In the end the subjective theory of value isn't a very good theory of value. However it is useful as a way to explain the various actions of individuals in given economic contexts. Marxism tends to shy from those individuals.   Compare to this fragmentary description of the LTV:  Hence Marx made the important distinction between abstract and concrete labour. Concrete labour is the specific process involved in making the definite physical properties of a given commodity. I.e. the labour involved in making a coffee or sewing a shirt. However value isn't created through concrete labour, since every act of labour whose product (or service) is exchanged produces value. As value, commodities are qualitatively equal; therefore the various acts of labour that produce values must have the status of qualitatively equal human labour. Hence carpentry doesn't produce value as carpentry (it produces a chair); rather it produces value as human labour, whose product is exchange with other products of human labour. Such value is precisely abstracted from its concrete manifestation. Marx speaks of this value producing labour as abstract labour. Independent of all concreteness, all these labours have an abstract relation as producing commodities. Of course such abstract labour isn't visible, only a particular concrete labour is, ""just as the concept of 'tree' isn't visible: I'm only capable of perceiving a concrete botanical plant. As with the term 'tree', abstract labour is an abstraction, but a completely different kind of abstraction. Normally, abstractions are constituted in human thought. We refer to the commonalities among individual examples and then establish an abstract category, such as 'tree'. But in the case of abstract labour, we are not dealing with such a 'mental abstraction' but with a 'real abstraction', by which we mean an abstraction that is carried out in the actual behaviour of humans, regardless of whether they are aware of it.""1  1 An Introduction to the three volums of Karl Marx's Capital (pdf.)"

This result in explain value via price when value is supposed to explain price. The cost-benefit analysis necessary to marginal value can only operate with a 'cost'.   So this isn't entirely true. Preferences and utility functions (and hence marginal utility) are defined without any reference to price. If preferences are given and ""rational,"" then they can be represented by a continuous utility function with no reference to price. This is one of the most famous results in economics, first proved by Wald, then more generally by Debreau (1954).   Prices enter in the general equalibrium setting, and here things get a bit dicey (we need a Walrasian auctioneer, for instance). But prices are still take to be independent of preferences. If you are willing to take preferences as exogenous (a big ""if""), then I'm not sure I see where there is any circularity."
AskSocialScience,36x7vw,aq12wsxcd,3,Sat May 23 22:19:49 2015 UTC,"Preferences and utility functions (and hence marginal utility) are defined without any reference to price.   not quite. the good part of the marginal theory of value is that it recognises the interaction of preferences with price. If utility preferences of formed in the abstract (i.e. outside of any economic interaction) then the marginal theory ends up losing it's critical content, and it's 'economic' content (after all in the abstract by definition makes economics irrelevant). On the other hand if use preferences change in the interaction of price, which it's pretty obvious they do, then the idea of placing any emphasis on 'abstract' preferences 'pre-market' seems irrelevant (insofar as they can become undermined in the first instance). Thus even if your defence is correct the problem for marginal value theory isn't solved, but deepens, insofar as it becomes something which is totally abstracted from economic phenomena. Meaning marginal value theory becomes detached from economics and unable to explains economic relationships. To negate the circularity of marginal value theory you're required to decouple value and price, but this only enters more problems insofar as value theory's existence is to explain price. If I can have rational subjective preferences without reference to price, but that this fact is still relevant to price, we enter a contradiction. Remove price, you end up removing a link to value and thus the point of the theory. And we merely end up with a 'theory' that discussed the formation of subjective preferences in the abstract.   But prices are still take to be independent of preferences   I don't get how this can make sense if marginal theory is to explain anything. If I walk into a shop with the feeling I want some orange juice yet find such juice to be $2 whereas apple is $1, I undergo a mental analysis of cost vs. benefit to me. Now what does marginal value theory gain by saying prices are independent of my preferences? In fact to make this so undermine some of the most basic assumptions of mainstream economics (i.e. substitution becomes nonsense). And imagine in this scenario that marginalist was simply to state that preferences are arrived at independent of price. In this case either this individual buys apple juice and contradicts the 'abstract utility' that had been arrived at an assumed to be absolute (in effected by prices). Or orange juice is purchased, in which case the theory is unaffected insofar as it cannot be proven by that which it defined itself against (i.e. if the theory defines itself separate from price it cannot be justified in reference to price). Nevertheless, in the case of the latter, the fact that early marginalists eternally explain and justify utility value via price (or rather usually by changing 'conditions') seems to suggest that they at least thought that preferences and utility functions are not given. The fact for example that the subjective value of water to me, the preference for it against other commodities, becomes greater when I'm thirsty already implies that preferences aren't given but are dependant on the situations we find ourselves in, after all isn't that the whole point of 'rational actors'?"
AskSocialScience,36x7vw,mosestrod,1 point,Sat May 23 23:42:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand your point. The Wald/Debreu utility representation theory is foundational to all modern economics. Preferences do interact with prices, but only after preferences are formed. I think maybe you are conflating the idea of ""demand"" (in a Marshallian sense) with ""preferences"" and ""utility.""    On the other hand if use preferences change in the interaction of price, which it's pretty obvious they do, then the idea of placing any emphasis on 'abstract' preferences 'pre-market' seems irrelevant (insofar as they can become undermined in the first instance).   Demand changes when it ""interacts"" with price, but preferences are almost always considered to be exogenous. I actually agree with the idea that ""pre-market"" is a poor way to formulate the problem, but it does lead to tractable results. To a large extent, economists are unconcerned with how preferences are formed. Demand, on the other hand, is central to economic analysis.    If I walk into a shop with the feeling I want some orange juice yet find such juice to be $2 whereas apple is $1, I undergo a mental analysis of cost vs. benefit to me. Now what does marginal value theory gain by saying prices are independent of my preferences? In fact to make this so undermine some of the most basic assumptions of mainstream economics (i.e. substitution becomes nonsense).    As I said (and cited) above, the independence of prices and preferences is fundamental to mainstream economics. Again, you are conflating ""demand"" with ""preference.""   An economist explains your visit to market as this: You enter the store with preferences over orange juice and apple juice that is representable by a continuous utility function u(o,a). You then view the prices of the juices (po , pa ). Finally, you look into your pocket and see how much money you have (M). As a rational economic agent, you solve the problem  max u(o,a) subject to p^o*o + p^a*a <= M   The solution to this problem for arbitrary prices and income are functions denoted o* (po , pa , m) and a* (po , pa , m). So while the choice of how much orange and apple juice to buy (o* and a* ) are functions of price, the utility function that represents preferences remains unchanged for every possible price/income combination. To be more precise, the domain of the utility function is the set of all possible (orange juice, apple juice) combinations. Price is not in the domain of u(.).   Marginal rates of substitution are likewise calculated without reference to prices. I'm not sure where you got the idea that prices were necessary here, but it is plainly not the case.    The fact for example that the subjective value of water to me, the preference for it against other commodities, becomes greater when I'm thirsty already implies that preferences aren't given but are dependant on the situations we find ourselves in, after all isn't that the whole point of 'rational actors'?   The idea that preferences change is unobjectionable, and somewhat problematic from an economic perspective. However, as long as your preferences at each point in time are complete and transitive, a solution to the above problem exists. Again though, preferences are formed independently of prices. So obviously demand for water can change when you are thirsty, but this is not evidence that prices have influenced preferences, nor is it necessary for prices to influence preferences in order for demand to change in different situations."

So for example under NAFTA Ethyl corp. sued Canada when the government banned their gasoline additive because it was toxic and a health concern. The government then rescinded the ban, which meant that an American gasoline corporation was able to dictate Canadian law and go over the heads of Canadian legislators and courts. That has nothing to do with discrimination, it's about shifting legal authority to unaccountable and non-democratic corporations at the expense of our elected government.  Lone Pine Resources is using NAFTA’s investor “rights” chapter to sue Canada because a Quebec moratorium on shale gas drilling under the earthquake-prone St. Lawrence Valley has, according to the firm, expropriated its profits and violates minimum standards of treatment guaranteed by the treaty.  (PDF link)  To make it even more twisted, Lone Pine is a Canadian company.  They were able to sue under NAFTA’s investor protection clause, using their American subsidiary.  Expect American companies to learn from this trick.  The U.S.-owner of a hunting lodge in the Northwest Territories sued Canada because the territorial government introduced conservation measures that were designed to decrease the number of caribou that could be hunted each year. The investor is seeking C$4 million as compensation.  On the other hand, Canadian mining companies have used ISDS provisions in other treaties against the Kyrgiz Republic for a law awarding mine workers extra pay based on their having to work under certain kinds of conditions.   And against Egypt in part for raising their minimum wage after the Arab Spring uprisings there. And against El Salvador after the nation declared a moratorium on mining licences following widespread public concern of a potential threat to drinking water quality from mining operations.  When Canada imposed a temporary ban on the export of a hazardous waste called polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), considered by the U.S. EPA to be toxic to humans and the environment, U.S. waste treatment company S.D. Myers launched a case under NAFTA that resulted in an ISDS tribunal ordering Canada to pay the company almost $6 million.  To be clear here:  That's a US company, using the US government (and US tax dollars) to sue Canada to ensure that Canadian PCBs continue to flow into the US.   (Link to this and more examples)  Yes, free trade is a good idea.  But countries already recognize this, and the trade barriers are pretty much all long gone.  When you hear about TPP, TTIP, CETA and other new trade agreements, they're all about ISDS provisions.  More citations available on request.  But they're not hard to find on Google."

On a linguistic note, Spanish (like English and many other languages) frequently uses patronymic names, meaning they were originally derived from the name of the person's father. Just as English has the names Johnson, Robertson, Peterson, etc., names like Ramírez, Hernández, and Martínez originally were literal names for son of Ramiro, Hernando, or Martín, respectively. (In the US and Mexico especially, you'll frequently see the accents dropped from these names.) If you go back far enough, you reach a common etymology with the 's used in forming the possessive case in English.  In other words, Rodriguez is sort of the Spanish version of Rodrigo's.

AskSocialScience,36ukak,Illum503,15,Fri May 22 06:24:17 2015 UTC,"Political scientist Ronald Inglehart didn't think so. He applied Maslow's hierarchy of needs to political socialization. Children socialized in an environment of scarcity were thought to grow up with traditional views valuing law and order, safety and security -- basically all the stuff on the bottom half of Maslow's chart. This reflected pretty much every generation before the baby boomers. But Ingelhart noted something different about children born after WW2. They valued more abstract concepts like equality, environmental concerns, and well, peace -- the stuff on the higher end of the chart. This led to a shift to what he called postmaterialist values. He uses this to explain the shift in values we saw in the 60s through today.   He tested this hypothesis and it turned out that the countries with the highest formative economic conditions had the highest rankings for postmaterialist values. Moreover, subsequent research found that postmaterialist values conformed to fluctuations in economic conditions (Clarke et al).   As for this:    is there evidence that the death of soldiers, many of whom would have glorified and dreamed of war, killed off the kind of people who would pass that sentiment down to the next generations?   Well, there were very bloody and costly wars before, and that had never happened anywhere as far an I know. Maybe someone else does.   Personally (if anyone actually gives a shit what I think) I agree with the general observations of Inglehart, but take some issue with the theoretical foundation. he never tests the psychological foundation of his theory.

Said's contention is that the observation and understanding of the Orient is self-serving to the Occident, so though it may seem like there is equality, actually it's about the preservation of power and the exercise of it. Fanon explicitly tackles this in Black Skins White Mask , where he talks about how the different parts of the French colonial empire relate to each other and how the stratification is a reflection of how the Orient is seen and how the Orient sees itself."
AskSocialScience,36t7l6,D-Hex,6,Thu May 21 23:36:07 2015 UTC,"If you read the introduction to the book, you'll find that Said says that his choice of what's now the middle east (and was the Orient, in part) as the focus of his study is a matter of methodology. It isn't intended to discount the importance of similarly distorted perceptions on the part of the West towards other parts of the world that could be considered the non-west.   What is true, and what Said's book does account for, is that the history of interaction between what's now Europe and what's now considered the Middle East is unusually long and deep. It arguably can be traced back to the accounts of the Persians in Herodotus. Also, Europe and the Middle East are geographically contiguous: that means that the distinction between the two regions, and by implication the West and non-west, in that case are more clearly arbitrary.   Said's focus is on how pervasive the epistemology of Orientalism is, not on the severity of the abuses it entailed, so this makes sense."

There is some evidence that income inequality is linked to depression rates such as here for women and here in aggregate.  Those of low socioeconomic status are more likely to have depressive episodes so the evidence is out there.  That being said, it is pretty obvious that psychology is not his field.  There appears to be a lot of conflation of unhappiness and depression, which is not good.  Clinical depression is not simply being sad in relation to bad things.  Social determinants such as low-income and income inequality affect the prevalence of Clinical Depression but they are not the sole cause.  Also his discussion of therapy isn't really consistent with standard practice.  He largely ignores medications which do work very well, in fact according to the APA's guidelines ""An antidepressant medication is recommended as an initial treatment choice for patients with mild to moderate major depressive disorder [I] and definitely should be provided for those with severe major depressive disorder unless ECT is planned [I].""

There is much less publicity and public awareness / opinion about air arrivals.    The Australian Parliament has published a study on its website http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22library%2Fprspub%2FHGNW6%22  Although the proportion of asylum seekers arriving by boat has increased significantly in the last few years, and boat arrivals continue to be the focus of much public and political attention, they are in fact more likely to be recognised as refugees than those who have arrived by air. For example, the final protection visa grant rate for asylum seekers from the top country of citizenship for boat arrivals (Afghanistan) has varied between about 96 and 100 per cent since 2009; while the final protection visa grant rate for those applying for asylum from one of the top country of citizenship for air arrivals (China) is usually only around 20 to 30 per cent.33 Dr Khalid Koser (Lowy Institute for International Policy) argues that it is important to note this distinction:  The reason this ... point is important is that it means that arguably Australia is worrying about the wrong asylum seekers. Whereas the majority of those arriving by boat are refugees, the majority of those arriving by air are not. 34  However, it is interesting to note that in recent years there has been an increase in the number of protection visas granted to non-IMA asylum seekers arriving by air.

First level being leaders or their representatives directly negotiation and the second level being domestic ratification.  James Fearon discussed how foreign policy decisions hinge on domestic ""audience costs"" and signaling.  Leaders of different regimes have different costs, credibility, and unknowns that affect their ability to successfully negotiate with other leaders.  After a certain point in negotiations, because of mounting audience costs, it is more preferable to become hostile in negotiations.  Bueno de Mesquita, Smith, etc. created a formal model agent-based decision theory based on cost/benefit calculus in choices leaders make.  They weigh the costs and benefits of a decision regarding foreign bodies as they understand it, with an error term being the unknowns and potential minunderstanding of the situation.  It all comes down to utility maximization, with leaders not making decisions unless they think that they will come out in the net positive.  Utility + odds of success = decision.  There is also Bueno de Mesquita et al.'s ""selectorate theory"" that adds a domestic element similar to Putnam's.  The selectorate is composed of various levels: the body of decision makers, the more powerful decision makers, and members of the ruling coalition.  Selectorate varies from regime to regime, with democracy having higher levels, but autocracy having more powerful ones.  The selectorate can challenge the leader's office at any time, but weighs again the utility and the chance of success before doing so.  However, the leader understands their capacity for replacement and thus behaves in a manner that will maintain his/her office.

Central bank policy can ameliorate this of course through tighter monetary policy.  Consider the analogy of energy prices in the 1970s. The scarcity of oil, artificial in nature, drove up prices.  The Federal reserve at the time was unable to curb the inflation that followed, in part because they were unable to tolerate the slowdown. In the long run, higher input costs reflect reduction in supply and therefore lower growth/contraction of an economy.   All of this isn't to say that we shouldn't promote living wages. But rather the degree by which it reduces the quantity of employment and therefore output can have consequences for economic output.

Of course given that any national total minimum wage rises will mean relative increases viz. international competitors and consumers, the result could be bad for national businesses. And as US goods increase the balance of trade may become problematic, with problematic inflationary results for the currency. That said I think this could be off set if the US firms want to remain internationally competitive whilst accepting the minimum wage they'll simply have to cut into their balance sheets and profits.

The article notes that it's the $11 minimum wage that forced closure. Not $15, so we can't know the effect of the $15 minimum wage.  Second, we can't know if the owner was lying and had to close for other reasons but wanted publicity against the minimum wage hike, for example.  Third, assuming the owner was not lying (I'm not saying they are, I actually do believe them), the article only talks about one business. We can't know how it affected every other yet.  Fourth, if the business closures as a result of the hike had been major, we'd have seen an increase in the unemployment rate. That hasn't happened yet. The effects remain to be seen, but at the moment they haven't been many as far as I can tell.  Finally, if the effects opened another business, or helped other businesses hire more workers because of increased demand due to a rise in disposable income for minimum wage workers, then the net result could be positive. But again, we don't know that. It's just one data point among thousands.   Edit 2: my comment to op was deleted (thanks op for suppressing an opinion you don't agree with).

Further, reports of businesses closing or the like don't provide a holistic view, nor can we be sure they isolate the minimum wage as the cause properly.

Differentiating between good or bad, not given any evaluation criteria, economics can not do.

AskSocialScience,36otb9,mosestrod,1 point,Fri May 22 08:26:35 2015 UTC,"because positivism relies on a highly problematic distinction between object and subject derived from science but which simply cannot be afforded in any social science. Positivism ignores human consciousness and how the subject mediates that 'objective world'. Positivism thus not only fails in terms of explanation and description, but tends towards conservatism in it's preference for 'brute facts' over interpretation and theory. This critique is one of the Frankfurt school's critical theory and sociology. Expressed best by Horkheimer. Hegel essentially sums up the damning critique of positivism (though it hadn't been formulated at the time), in the opening sentences of his phenomenology of the spirit when he talks about instrumental reasons. Instrumental reason of which positivism is a type betrays the existence of it's own weakness in it's essence. As a methodology that mediates human attempts to access the 'objective world', it reveals the prerequisite for it's existence; that the material world isn't immediately known to us. That some instrument must be applied to gain knowledge. Yet this instrument changes the world it attempts to merely access. There's a multitude of other problems of positivism. For one it attempts to quantify and make static changing social phenomena, and thus tends towards ahistoricial analysis. Secondly it attempts to categorise the social world into systemic and mechanical logical categories (such as science categories the biological world in genus and so on). This kind of programmatism that is the real practice of positivism and those who attempt a scientific approach to society (as Comte put it) ends not only in mystification, but also - as was well argued by the Frankfurt School theorists - a totalitarianism that ultimately if accidentally led to fascism."

According to the random-effects model, the effect of all moderators, including type of Internet use, indicator of well-being, quality of Internet use measure, and participant age and gender were insignificant. Since these moderators failed to explain the variation in the relationship between Internet use and psychological well-being, future investigations should consider the possible sources of these differences.""   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20557242"

I didn't find any research on this question, but maybe some additional data to consider.  Your starting point seems to assume that rape is mostly the result of criminals looking to have sex with a random person. And for that group of people, your line of thinking might be right - assuming that this group of criminals has the money to pay for what they want.   However, according to RAINN, of reported cases, 4 out of 5 rape victims knew the aggressor beforehand and nearly half of aggressors were a friend or family member to the victim.   So, would this group of rapists go elsewhere for sex? I guess it comes down to their motivation, which I deduct is in large part convenience and an exercise power over a specific person. I personally doubt very much that the uncle raping his niece would go out of his way to find pay for a prostitute, or that the drunk girl raping her sleeping roommate would go out of her way to find and pay for a prostitute."
AskSocialScience,36oow9,theshawnna,2,Thu May 21 08:16:15 2015 UTC,"Another side of this question is that in decriminalizing prostitution, prostitutes who are victims of rape will be able to report criminal sexual assault without fear of legal repercussions and potentially reduced stigma from admitting that they sell sex for money.  If rapists who target prostitutes assume that no one will consider their victims credible, then legalization may result in police taking victim claims more seriously.   Admittedly, this is a large presumption, but even if in the short term it doesn't lead to greater protection of prostitutes, it may lead to an increase in reporting of rape to police by prostitutes, which may lead to greater public policy reforms.  Moreover, it may cause potential rapists to reconsider the perception that raping prostitutes is consequence-free. Thus while justice for prostitutes may not immediately improve, they may benefit from decreased vulnerability/marginalization.  A human rights approach recognizes that it is not sufficient to merely remove sex work from the operation of the criminal law, but also protect the legal rights of the sex worker. This would mean attempting to address specific abuses that sex workers have to face all of the time."

The questions I'd ask myself are:    what are the trends?  what do these trend show us about who cares about this tradition? Are there any differences in the trends geographically, along gender lines, along generational lines, along religious lines? Do smaller communities seem to care more or less than larger communities? Does the change in religious affiliation correlate with the rise or fall of the trend?    The next part is tricky, if there are any benefits or consequences of holding onto culture. You could look at GDP, public health data, family size, literacy, finishing school, innovation ... but saying changes in these things is a result of letting go of a tradition would be tricky because the opposite could be true."

To sum up the findings, suicide there became symbolic in the same sense that a word is symbolic. We use single words to communicate sometimes complex concepts. In Micronesia, suicide became something you do to communicate your inability to choose.   Malcom Gladwell touches on this (I forgot in which book) and he concludes that suicide epidemics rise as a sort of symbolic rebellious and then continue as the adolescence population becomes curious. He compares it to the teenage smoking phenomena. Teenagers often start smoking because it represents sophistication, class, and adulthood but it becomes an epidemic when teenagers start smoking just because everyone else is. In Micronesia, they did interviews with kids who survived their attempt only to find out he/she ""just wanted to try it"". These suicide epidemics also utilize the same methods of taking ones life, again because everyone else is doing it like this.   Another reason for suicide epidemics can be the ""follow the leader"" effect that it has. Specially when high profile suicides happen. A number of people are probably considering suicide so when a high profile suicide happens or their friend commits suicide or the suicide rate in their region goes up, it serves as a 'green light' for the individual to go ahead with their plans.

He does not say that people read theology: they were still illiterate, and as you put it yourself, were taught by the ""religious elites"". Another important thing in what he said is that the Church wanted to inform the laity. Conversion did not happen via pamphlets, it happened when a priest was sent to evangelize (think colonialism). Basicaly, theological knowledge came from the priests, not the books.   Now, why would the medieval peasant know so much theology ? Something you have to understand is that at that time, there was no state, no Nation. Institutions were different, and the main institution was the Church. The priests educated children (no state, no public school) but also collected taxes and acted as bureaucrats. One of the reasons Clovis got baptized in the fifth century was (despite the fact that he might have believed in God, but that's something he only can confirm) that he could take advantage of the basic administration that was already in place. Everything went through the church as it was an organized administrative organism, built by Roman bureaucrats.   I think it is important to separate the Church from the faith. The Church was based on christianism, but it was also a multi-purpose organization. Since it was based on a faith, it needed to spread understanding in the faith so as to why they existed and needed people to believe in them and their necessity. I mentioned Nations earlier : most people believe they are part of a nation (as a cultural hegemony the way Antonio Gramsci put it). But if you take off what makes the admnistrative state of a specific nation, you cannot observe it empirically. Borders are administrative constructs, so are passports. You can't ""define"" a nation or a nationality. But you do know your Nation's history, its founding fathers, its principles, without having read the Constitution, the same way a peasant knew Christianity without having ever read the Bible.   Theological knowledge was almost a necessity, a ""collective conscience"" since it was the main frame of reference.  On institutions as the main frame of reference : Can't go wrong with Durkheim.  Karl Marx theorized that societies moved from feudalism to the modern nation state. Without going into class struggle theory, it gives an interesting account of how a ""nation"" is created.  On members of the church as administrators, I'm sorry but my only source is Paul Viollet and his Histoire administrative de la France. There is however very interesting perspectives with the study of South America."

There was administration separate from the Church. Starting in the 12th Century, Faculties of Law were putting out tons of lay administrators. Many took positions with nobles and formed early civil services. These were the first bureaucrats in the modern sense, and they laid down the foundation of the modern state. These administrators were not priests.  When Clovis was baptized in the Fifth Century, his desire was to be legitimized by the still extant Roman Empire. The Imperial administration was staffed by laity who knew little of Christian theology. These administrators were not priests.  I'm not sure what you mean about priests educating children. Education in the Middle Ages took place at home, in monasteries, and in universities. All three had lay scholars.   I recommend reading Norman Cantor's The Civilization of the Middle Ages."

I remember Paul Viollet stating that the priests were the ones taking care of most of the administrative work (including census, etc) but since he is from the beginning of the 20th century he might have been contradicted since. He stated Clovis' baptism was indeed to be legitimized, but also to take advantage of the already-present Church.  On the subject of monks and priests teaching children, maybe that's a legend we're taught in school (like the knights who couldn't get up because of their armor's weight) but in the French history classes you're always told that the members of the church taught people how to read. Take here for example. They state that this changed in the 12th century when universities were built, but under the Pope's authority."
AskSocialScience,36i7t4,Zenobist,2,Wed May 20 04:55:33 2015 UTC,"Sorry, let me clarify a bit.   He does not say that people read theology: they were still illiterate, and as you put it yourself, were taught by the ""religious elites"".    I'm not implying people read theology either. I said people were engaged with theology. Sure, they were taught by the religious elites, but they were engaged and well-informed with what is in their religion. I take that means (inferring from /u/telkanuru's post and this post) laity were aware, theologically, why some people were condemned as heretics, for example. As opposed to our understanding of heresy--usually we only understand it in basic terms. An average Joe would not spend their time to understand difference between theotokos and christotokos or one nature and two nature, for example.  Medieval laymen were well-read in theology outside of practical purpose like we are today (if it helps us in work, if it's in religious festives, etc). Today we are only engaged with religion only if it serves our practical purpose. /u/telkanuru himself said this era is when Christian laity is the least educated about their religion.  It is probable I might misunderstood what /u/telkanuru means though so please feel free to correct me.   Theological knowledge was almost a necessity, a ""collective conscience"" since it was the main frame of reference.   Regardless, it still leads us to this interesting point. And I still linger in the question: I get it that the modern nation-state replaced the religious collective conscience, but what motivated medieval laity understood complex theological discourse which serves no purpose in their daily life then? What does Christology, for example, have anything to do with poetic space and shared history to make up a collective conscience?"
AskSocialScience,36i7t4,Zenobist,1 point,Tue May 19 20:14:45 2015 UTC,"Ok, I think I see what you mean : for the average person to chose to believe in a duality of God's nature, they would have to be quite interested in deep theological concerns. The cynical in me would say that they were preached by the character of Henry of Lausanne and followed him blindly (Wikipedia says he was very charismatic but since it isn't sourced we'll put that aside). Cults attract a wide variety of people, I would expect many of them to not have believed in anything specific before joining. Also this is the South-West of France, which was a problematic place. There was Aquitaine, which was English for a long time, the cultural region of Occitania, very distinct from northern France, and as /u/idjet says, the place where the Cathare heresy happened, which was so significant it is now part of the cultural heritage of the region (if you ever get the chance to go to Carcassonne, it's everywhere). Since we're doing Social Sciences, we have to take into account the specific cultural configuration of the region : this specific region and its people had a lot of reasons to go away from dominant institutions.  As to why people were condemned as heretics, again I'm going to be very cynical and claim it didn't need theological knowledge. Foucault demonstrated that things like ""heresy"" are social constructs built to put some people at the fringes of the society; basically, institutions found a way to disqualify troublemakers (a heretic or a madman are people who do not fit society's standards). I can't remember the source, but a following analysis of sorcery demonstrated that most witches burned were women who wore pants and refused to marry. You get the idea.   /u/idjet says that Bernard does not mention debate, only his obsession with compliance and how to preach. You can doubt everyone's motives here, as to why one wanted compliance, why others followed a heretic. Bernard might as well have exaggerated his accounts; his work was obviously inquisitory, political in essence. Never trust a fanatical medieval monk.   What I meant by ""theological knowledge"" was probably not phrased well. I meant that it was basic, not deep : knowledge of the existence of God and His nature: that he was in everything, he was transcendant, etc. That does not mean people would engage in a debat over his monophysism. Neither would your Average Joe, but he would still be interested to know if he can talk with God. Maybe less than his medieval counterpart, but that is because Christianism is less central to modern society, everyone in it and modern institutions (I can't think of any christian Theocracy left today).   So here is my answer (and again, it may seem cynical but hey, social sciences are all about neutralizing social facts) : the people who followed a heresy didn't actually followed the heresy: they followed the heretic priest. The complex theological understandings didn't really matter. For all we know, there might not even have been that many people who acted like heretics, medieval historical accounts aren't always reliable.  I hope I answered your question."

You are extremely likey to vote for what your parents voted for, because you were taught that is the right way to go because you were socialized this way. Voting behaviour and party loyalty is a wide and far-reaching topic, and not really my specialty, but if you are interested in the subject, I would suggest starting here, a few interesting authors are quoted.  You also have to consider your specific situation. You are american, you live in a two-party system that has been this way for two hundred years, and where the turnout for presidential elections  has not gone above 60% in the last 47 years. You could bring a lot of arguments to that, and the explanations are possibly infinite, but the bottom line is that to keep voting in a country where one person out of two doesn't (partly because of a loss of belief in a locked legislative process, thanks to what I mention next), you have to believe pretty damn strongly in your party.

If you are tempted to switch to a BA in order to have a more flexible schedule for more math courses, and if grad school is a goal, then do it. Math courses are a better signal of your ability to grad schools than anything else. Take Calc II and III, linear algebra, a proof course, econometrics, and probability theory. If you have room take real analysis, differential equations, and advanced statistics. Kill the quantitative section of the GRE (which I did not do).  Take a few programming courses. Learn to use SAS or SPSS (if you want to go into the private sector as a backup), Stata, and R. If you are ambitious, learn Matlab. If you love programming. learn Python and either C++ or Java.

AskSocialScience,36gnyz,pchancharl,8,Tue May 19 06:27:31 2015 UTC,"Hey there. I studied folklore and I have access to databases in the folklore theme. If you are in university and want to do serious research about it, I would suggest you begin looking through databases. If not, I have access to Daily Life Online - World Folklore and Folklife, and here is what they give as a mini bibliography on Merlin from an thematic dictionary:      Funk & Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology, and Legend       Maria Leach       A poet, wizard, and prophet, who lived supposedly in the 6th century, and in the 12th became a prominent figure in the Arthurian legend. The works ascribed to him are few, but the medieval literature about him is very extensive, being found in most of the languages of Western Christendom. The material may be divided into four classes: 1) Welsh poems; 2) Geoffrey of Monmouth’s works; 3) the French and derivative romances; 4) local associations and folktales. The Breton poems printed in Barzaz-Breiz by La Ville-marqué will not be considered since they are forgeries.       1) During the Dark Ages there grew up a legend about a wild man of the woods who was endowed with the gift of prophecy. Among the Ulster Irish it was told about King , among the Strathclyde Britons about Lailoken, and among the Welsh about Myrddin, who was in all likelihood a historic bard of royal blood in the 6th century. The story of Myrddin, one infers, ran to the effect that he went mad at the battle of Ardderyd (574) near Carlisle because of grief at the carnage. He lived many years in the wood of Celyddon (southern Scotland), subsisting on roots and berries. He prophesied three different deaths for the same boy, but was vindicated years later when the boy fell from a rock, was hanged by his feet from a tree, his head under water, and so drowned. Thrice he gave way to laughter, knowing as a seer that the unsuspected queen had been lying with a paramour, that a beggar was sitting over buried treasure, and that a youth, buying new shoes, would never live to wear them. This motif came from India, probably through Jewish channels. No authentic effusions of Myrddin have survived, and it is only in obscure poems of the 11th and 12th centuries that we get evidences of the familiarity of the legend and spurious vaticinations—allusions to Ardderyd, to the long life in the wood of Celyddon, to an apple tree under which, Myrddin says, he enjoyed the company of a fair, sportive maid, to his sister Gwendydd, and prophecies relating to events of the 11th and 12th centuries. A poetic address delivered by the seer from his grave concerns the reigns of William Rufus and the two Henrys, and includes a warning against the time when a strong, freckled man would reach a certain ford over the Usk. Giraldus Cambrensis tells us that the Welsh took this prophecy so seriously that when it seemed to be fulfilled by Henry II in 1163, they were much disheartened. Indeed, throughout the Middle Ages the mantic verses of Myrddin had a potent influence. Though all early tradition connects the prophet with Strathclyde, a late legend reported that he departed with the Thirteen Treasures of Britain to the Glass House on Bardsey Island, and was still there, though doubtless invisible to human eye.       2) Geoffrey of Monmouth, the learned but unscrupulous Oxford scholar, finished about 1135 his Prophetia Merlini, professedly a translation from Welsh or Breton. It followed the convention of giving ex post facto predictions of events in somewhat obscure phrases. Arthur is referred to as the Boar of Cornwall, who will trample on the necks of foreigners and inspire fear in the house of Romulus and whose end will be doubtful—evident allusions to the fabulous exploits which Geoffrey was already inventing about the hero and to the famous British hope of his return. The struggles of the Red Dragon (Wales) with the White Dragon (the Saxons), the Norman Conquest, the death of William Rufus are similarly sketched, and the sinking of the White Ship (1120) is foretold in the words: “The Lion’s whelps shall be transformed into fishes of the sea.” Geoffrey, having reached his own time, is forced to deal cryptically with the unknown future, indulges in picturesque rigmarole about the Castle of Venus, the Ass of Wickedness etc., but does echo one genuine tradition of the return of Cadwalader (d. 664). Almost all of the book, then, is a fabrication, but it had a prodigious success, inspiring many commentators throughout the Middle Ages, and editions were printed in Germany in the 17th century, though William of Newburgh had exposed the sham as early as 1198. When Geoffrey published the History of the Kings of Britain (c. 1136), he incorporated the prophecies and provided an account of their supposed author. He lifted out of Nennius’ History of the Britons the story of Vortigern’s tower, the fatherless boy, and the prophecy about the Red and White Dragons, coolly identifying the prophetic boy with Merlin. Later he credited Merlin with transferring the Giants’ Dance (Stonehenge) from Ireland to its present site. Again by his magic powers the wizard gave Uther the form of Gorlois and so brought about the begetting of Arthur in Tintagel castle. Though this last tale seems based on Cornish tradition and ultimately on the Irish Birth of Mongan, the role of Merlin in Geoffrey’s History is an arbitrary medley of the author’s. When, however, his Life of Merlin was written about 1150, he used, even at the expense of consistency, much genuine Welsh lore. Merlin is no longer the counselor of Uther and Arthur but a king of South Wales, who engaged in a battle which can be recognized as the Ardderyd of the poems, and the names of the other participants are traditional. His sister Gwendydd appears as Ganieda. We have the madness, the life in the forest, the triple death, the three laughs, and a poetic dialog with Taliesin, in which there are echoes of the vernacular poems as well as of Ovid and Isidore of Seville. The great discrepancy between Geoffrey’s two accounts of the mage led Giraldus to state that there were two persons, Merlin Ambrosius of the History and Merlin Calidonius of the poetic Life.       3) About the year 1200 Robert de Boron, a Burgundian poet, composed a romance about Merlin, of which 500 lines have survived but which was rendered into prose and introduced into three compilations, those of the Didot and Huth MSS. and the Vulgate cycle. Robert seems to have known Wace’s redaction of Geoffrey’s History and gave a confused version of the Merlin story. Though he shows no acquaintance with the Life, he did borrow from some unknown source the motif of the triple death. He gave an elaborate account of Merlin’s begetting by an incubus, based on the apocryphal story of the begetting of Antichrist. Merlin is provided with a confidant, Blaise, who recorded all his prophecies; he advised Uther to establish the Round Table; after Uther’s death Merlin proposed to the barons that the true heir would be revealed by the test of the sword in the stone. The poem ended with Arthur’s coronation. In the 13th century the prose version received two continuations in which Merlin plays a large part as the counselor of Arthur, as seer, and as shape-shifter. The Vulgate continuation, though largely occupied with Arthur’s wars with the rebel kings, the Saxons, and the Romans, introduces the motif of the three laughs and the famous story of the wizard’s infatuation for Niniane or Viviane, which ends with her enchanting him under a whitethorn in the forest of Broceliande. This same legend occurs with variations in the other continuation (the Huth Merlin) and in the Prose Lancelot, and though doubtless influenced by such famous themes as the beguilement of Aristotle and Virgil, may well have had its root in Myrddin’s sporting with a maid under an apple tree in the wood of Celyddon, already mentioned. The Huth Merlin furnished the materials which Malory condensed and rearranged in his first four books. The Vulgate Merlin was thrice rendered into English, once as Arthour and Merlin about 1300 and twice about 1450. An extraordinary concoction is the Prophécies de Merlin, written in French by a Venetian between 1272 and 1279, and mingling veiled references to events in Italy and the Holy Land with fantastic adventures of the Arthurian cycle.       4) Merlin’s fame has been preserved in certain humbler forms. In the Scottish ballad of Child Rowland (Folk-Lore II: 183) he is a warlock who brings about the rescue of Arthur’s daughter from fairyland. There are Breton folktales about a wizard Murlu. Geoffrey of Monmouth’s spurious etymology of Carmarthen as Kaermerdin, town of Merlin, still lives on in the legend that Merlin’s favorite walk was along the banks of the Towy, and Geoffrey is also responsible for a Merlin’s Cave at Tintagel, though here, as elsewhere, one may suspect that the particular association is due to the romantic revival of the 19th century, not to old folk tradition. Merlin’s grave was pointed out at Drummelzier on the Tweed and in the Forest of Broceliande. According to a tradition of doubtful antiquity, the mage was born on the He de Sein off the Breton coast, and to it he conveyed the wounded Arthur."

It seems much more speculative than specific, and doesn't lend itself easily to academic citations.  That being said, it seems very unrealistic to me.  Here is a thought experiment:   Average cost per year for college in the US is 19,339.   Average salary for a 'Financial Aid Administrator' is $35k/year according to an arbitrary glassdoor search   Given this information and the hypothesis that 'more is spent on administration than tuition', one would expect there to be about 35/19.339 = 1.8 students for every financial aid professional (FAFSA accountant, school counselor, admissions officer, etc).  This does not pass the test of face-value validity, as it would mean that a school with 2,000 students would need 1,111 financial aid professionals, and that each of student would produce 6.6 months of financial aid paperwork per academic year.    This experiment has some obvious weaknesses, listed below.   The data on tuition costs includes room/board etc, but that would all be covered by financial aid so I feel like the statistic still stands for purposes of this exercise.   This assumes that the only cost of financial aid administration is a staffing one.  Obviously, there are costs associated with office space, office supplies, servers, network access, and administrative overhead (everything from payroll, HR, management, to policy makers who set rules on financial aid and decide on national standards).  It is a gross oversimplifications, but the question was incredibly broad and I am not familiar with a data source on how much the US spends on financial aid administration.  Since you failed to provide one in the question, I made up a number. Even if human costs were the only factor, my salary number is largely arbitrary.  I picked a location and a generic term on a single web search.  Still, it sounds about right to pay a low-level (ie non-administrative) accountant/processor/office employee about $35k.     Even with these weaknesses, I feel like the point stands.  This does not appear to be an issue where an error rate of 10%, 50%, or even 200% would compromise the results.

Ukraine isn't in the EU first (so no funding from that part) and was under almost exclusive Russian influence until recently. Think political instability. That's never helpful. Remember that Serbia was at war not so long ago, and tensions over Kosovo are still intact.   South Korea and Taiwan are special cases : they are in strategic locations in the pacific. There are lots of reasons for their development, one explanation given by Susan Strange is that they were instrumental for the US : with America helping them rebuild themselves they were effectively able to act as barriers to Communist domination in East Asia.

AskSocialScience,36fx7o,Zenobist,2,Tue May 19 08:55:58 2015 UTC,"Firstly it should be noted that 'eastern Europe' possess different types or forms of 'communism' between countries which themselves had different demographics, history, political economies and so on. Places like Romania under Ceausescu were very different to Yugoslavia under Tito (and his 'workers communism') which was in turn very different to say Soviet communism proper. And even between different Soviet communism, say what is now called Ukraine and Latvia, large differences exist.   Unfortunately for most ex-Soviet bloc et al. countries they didn't fair well in the post-communist era. GDP per capita in Russia has only recently returned around the levels of 1989. Whereas Ukraine still lags behind the sort of wealth experienced pre-1991. Poland is a different story, though it still ranks below average in the 'better life' standards of the OECD it's remarkable in it's distinction from most other emergent countries. Could Poland have done better? Probably, though it's hard to answer, the rapid sell off of state assets wasn't good for people in my opinion, especially considering they had explicitly voted and acted (in Solidarity) against such a policy (i.e. for 'socialism with a human face'). But to some extent the ruling parties of Poland had no choice and, once in power, had to change tact and accept the blackmail agreement forced upon them by the international (western) community via financial institutions to rapidly (under)sell-off state assets and land. Of course the whole point of this typical Shock Therapy in the form of the Balcerowicz Plan was to demobilise and confuse any opposition. Overall though in terms of GDP Poland has been a standout success, (though GDP is limited in measuring whether that success is felt by 'real' people). Compare Poland's growth from 1990-6 to other ex-Soviet nations: Poland = 6.61%. Hungary = -16.11%. Czech Republic = -1.94%. Russia = -41.94%. Ukraine = -58.55%. Belarus = -34.29%1  As a whole the uneven development of different countries post-1991 is perhaps best reflecting in the rather saddening opinion polls in countries such as Romania, where a return to 'Communism' generally receives overwhelming support from the population.

Consumption taxes are implemented in a variety of ways. A retail sales tax would be rather simple to implement on the face of it: if you buy something, you pay sales tax on it. Those would be your taxes for the year. In most estimations of how this would work, there would be rebates/transfers for low-income individuals, to ensure that they don't actually pay the tax, though this obviously means higher rates on everyone else who does pay it. The same sort of ""demogrants"" are proposed in implementing a value-added tax, which is usually a supplement to income tax systems. Some countries simply remove sales taxes from essential goods, like food and the rest, that the poor spend the majority of their income on.  A consumption tax like a value-added tax can be implemented differently, of course. There are a few methods for how it works, but the most common version is called the credit-invoice system. This article does a fairly good job of explaining how that system works, truthfully, though you can check out this paper as well (will start download, check pg. 3 and 4) for an explanation.  There are other proposals for consumption taxes as well. For example, the Hall-Rabushka proposal garnered some attention in the past, and the same goes for the X tax.  Does it work? Well, that depends on who you ask. I haven't seen anyone who believes a straight national retail sales tax would ever work. Some proponents of the X tax have solid arguments as far as I can tell, but transitioning to a consumption tax doesn't have a lot of political support. I recommend researching the proposals through various channels (the Tax Policy Center is a good place to start, but there are many other places to look) and seeing for yourself if you prefer or don't prefer a consumption tax proposal."
AskSocialScience,36fasv,bsox59,2,Mon May 18 23:01:56 2015 UTC,"It depends... but under certain conditions (arguably like conditions we face now), then yes.  The reasoning most commonly used on this is that lower interest rates increase lending. It's not wrong but it's only part of the whole picture. Lower interest rates also reduce the amount of fiscal expenditure into the private sector.   To really figure out if higher rates will improve private sector spending you have to weigh the commercial bank lending flows to the household and merchant sectors AGAINST the increased income that flows to the private sector from Treasury interest payments.  As it is right now, commercial bank lending is subdued owing to a persistent inclination of households and merchants wanting to deleverage (compared to 2003-2007, at least, there are a few signs leverage is picking up again, but signals are mixed).  Since desire to leverage seems subdued, it is fair to say that the interest paid by the Treasury if interest rates were to increase will over-compensate for the lackluster bank lending. This could mean that raising interest rates would actually put more income into the private sector, which could translate to more private sector growth.  As a sort of reference, Warren Mosler frequently argues this point, for example here (don't let the title fool you, he is arguing that zero interest rates with appropriate fiscal stimulus is his favorite policy, without fiscal stimulus it's more a mixed bag like I explained above).  Also see Noah Smith's article here"

Argentina started strongly, and should be doing well, but constantly messes up.  On to your question.  I don't know when Kuznets said this, but it was likely before evidence of the South Korea, Singapore and Taiwanese development 'miracles' (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305750X94901163), and definitely before China.  So, the Japan case isn't true anymore, but it probably was back then. And the economies of SK, Singapore, Taiwan and China have based a lot of their development policies on concepts those of Japan (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049007800000671). In another way, if we're just looking at post-WW2, Germany makes sense too. Japan and Germany, the biggest losers in WW2, became the worlds 2nd and 3rd economies for much of the post-War time period.  Argentina is still constantly having problems. If we think about when he said this though, and from my understanding of the statement, I think you could see the fall of China as something slightly similar, from a position of great wealth and power to not much. The 'rise' of China had likely yet to happen when he said this, unless it was early 80s before he died (1985), when there was a lot of economic growth in small towns and cities which spurred on the 'miracle' we have seen in the last 20 years,"

However in a way the lack of resources made Japan better positioned insofar as it didn't become the object of western imperialist concern in the same way as China or elsewhere in Asia. This connected to the cultivation of Japan as essentially a western imperial outpost (though it soon became more than that), a partner in the western project of capital accumulation. Japan was in a good position insofar as it had a strong demographic homogeneity (compared to say the utter variety of peoples in China) which drastically reduced internal conflict (though this would itself be challenged as industrialism produced a working-class that mobilised for it's interests increasingly). It also had a large population, that could be mobilised towards industrialisation, in a relatively small area of land.

As you lay out, strategic voting is completely rational (by definition--that's the strategic part), and it is impacted by beliefs.   Changing the information available about preferences before an election will change the subjective beliefs of voters at the time of the election (assuming they're fairly Bayesian). But everyone would still have beliefs about candidates' electoral viability in the absence of polling, and they can still vote strategically even if those beliefs are noisy. Public polling just makes those beliefs a bit more correlated between voters, so it's more reliable to depend on beliefs about viability.   Your second point about political preferences seems unrelated to strategic voting, but may be able to stand on its own. For purely rational voters, their vote choice and beliefs about others won't change the voter's preferences, so there's no reason that strategic voting or polling would lead to ""falsely"" bimodal distributions of preferences. But the endowment effect and other biases may come into play and produce multimodality if people's beliefs about their own preferences become biased.

Wherever else the terror had happened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares. But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell's dark vision, there was another - slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley's vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.  What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny ""failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions"".

Then, compare it by the amount of GDP spent in social security (hard to define in levels too, the US has one of the highest percentage of GDP spent on healthcare, yet it's widely considered to be inefficient).  For the sake of this, let's consider the criteria given by the GEDI and the index it gives thanks to this (http://thegedi.org/research/gedi-index/). The US is a good first, but in the top ten you also have countries that follow the ""Nordic Model"",  widely famous for its efficiency. If you read the WHO's report on healthcare systems (http://thepatientfactor.com/canadian-health-care-information/world-health-organizations-ranking-of-the-worlds-health-systems/) it's hard to find a correlation. Canada spends less than the US, its system is better, and it's the second best entreupreunarial country in the world according to GEDI.

I'm not sure where those ideas of yours are coming from.   Indeed, heterogeneity is a recurrent characteristic of triggers, along with the fact that PTSD can have different symptoms.   As noted by others, this obviously isn't a problem. The fact that there are many possible triggers doesn't mean we shouldn't attempt to warn for any of them. It just makes absolutely no sense to make that leap in logic (and I guess that's why it's a well-recognised fallacy[1]).   And then one should also consider that avoidance is a symptom, a behavior which is seen as a solution for the patient, that is actually damaging in the long-term. Considering this, it brings the ethical question of whether a study could facilitate for a group of people suffering PTSD avoidance via warnings   But this isn't really a problem as the avoidance is a symptom, not a cause. It's not like trigger warnings are going to cause people to develop avoidance behaviors, or at least we have no reason to think that's the case.    instead of aiding them learn to manage their symptoms and face their triggers, in order to test the effects of trigger warnings (putting aside the value of suggesting a therapeutic effect of trigger warning if one admits that therapy should help fight avoidance)   This is one of the weird assumptions - why do you think trigger warnings are there for avoidance? Most people who use them use them as informational tools, to guide them through the content that is coming up, not as an indicator of whether they should read or view the content[2].  So a better way of viewing trigger warnings, if you want to try to generalise from other research, is to treat them as a form of systematic desensitisation. Like in formal therapy sessions we tell the patient exactly what is coming up and we give them the chance to prepare themselves, and then we present increasing levels of stimuli at a pace they are comfortable with[3].   The alternative, having no trigger warnings, is more similar to the process of ""flooding"", where a sensitive stimulus is presented without warning and the patient is forced to experience it. We don't really use this any more because of how extremely harmful it is - and yet we seem to be okay with it occurring in the real world all the time?[4]  Do you mind if I ask what qualifications you have in psychology? (I'm not trying to dismiss your opinion based on whatever education level you have but I'm just trying to get my head around your perspective here and figure out where you're coming from).  EDIT: Added some sources:  [1] Perfect solution fallacy, which in context means that it doesn't follow that just because we can't account for all possible triggers that we shouldn't account for some triggers.  [2] For example, see the description of trigger warnings here.  [3] A description of systematic desensitisation can be found here.  [4] There's a decent overview of what flooding is and the general problem with it in this textbook chapter."

AskSocialScience,367a3t,Sadistic_Sponge,3,Sun May 17 13:18:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think terms such as ""obviously"" carry much value, as what is obvious for some isn't so for others, and because something being obvious doesn't mean that it's inherently good (or bad).   The ""obvious"" there refers to the major flaw in reasoning. If there is a flaw in reasoning then it is definitely an inherently bad thing.   The point is just that the conclusion you reached cannot be achieved through the reasoning you provided, so either the conclusion is wrong, the reasoning is wrong, or both.    Nonetheless, what I have said has to be contextualized with the idea of balancing the possible benefits with the possible drawbacks.   And that's absolutely fine. What I'm saying is just that I don't think you've identified any drawbacks in your post. Instead I think you reached some odd conclusions through blatantly fallacious reasoning and through a misunderstanding of the literature.    Potentially, trigger warnings allow for people suffering PTSD to avoid triggering content, but on the other hand, if triggers are specific, trigger warnings could have the perverse effect of making PTSD sufferers of avoiding content. This is just an example, not the example.   Sure, maybe that's true. But what you need to demonstrate is that avoidance is causing the problems and not just a symptom. If it's just a symptom then engaging in avoidance isn't going to make the problem worse. As a comparison, we can say that a symptom of schizophrenia is having religious thoughts, and we can point out that Sunday school leads to a possible increase in religious thoughts  but it's not true to say on that basis that Sunday school might lead to an increase in schizophrenia. Because the religious thoughts, like the avoidance, are symptoms of the underlying problem and not causes of it.  Importantly we also have to consider the fact that avoidance is unarguably going to be a necessary part, to some degree, in coping in the real world. So whilst exposure might be essential to a successful treatment program, it does not follow that unintentional, unsignalled, uncontrolled, random exposure is beneficial. As I mention in my other post, we actually know for a fact that that kind of exposure is associated with a range of negative outcomes.   Are the benefits truly there? Are the drawbacks truly there? Lacking research on the pros and cons, this debate can only remain hypothetical. In any case, I'm not against providing information, I just refrain uncertain about how good inserting e.g. ""TW: sexual violence"" is and refrain myself from uncritically endorsing it.   Which would be fine but you didn't exactly do that. You made a post which was pretty clearly negative against trigger warnings but for reasons that are logically sound and aren't accurate understandings of the literature.  I don't mind if you think trigger warnings are probably harmful based on generalisations from the literature. All I am critiquing is the poor logic and the bad understanding of the material that leads to your conclusions.   Pardon, it seems I have badly formulated that sentence: the verb helping is associated with the subject therapy, as in therapy aiming to help reduce avoidance, not trigger warnings. My discourse would have no internal coherence if I meant the other way around.   This comment doesn't really address anything I've written. I understand that you think therapy should be about helping reduce avoidance, I'm just pointing out that there is no reason to treat trigger warnings as pertaining to therapy and there's no reason to think that reducing avoidance is a universally good thing that should apply to all situations (especially non-therapeutic situations).   Is that a fact? Would somebody suffering from PTSD take the risk of being triggered if they have avoiding behavior?   Yes, trigger warnings are largely used as information about upcoming content. Would someone with avoidance behavior use it that way? Probably not, but that's okay because there is no reason to think that avoidance is a bad thing or forced exposure will help them.    That is an interesting way of seeing it. But shouldn't systematic desensitization be structured? We're talking about trigger warnings as if they were a clinician's tool, but trigger warnings aren't being applied by therapists, but by laypeople, if I'm not mistaken.   Well yes, of course, but that's my argument against your position. You are talking about trying to reduce avoidance and force exposure on people as a therapeutic tool but this tool is being applied haphazardly in an uncontrolled situation without the oversight of a practitioner, and there is no reason to think this will be helpful.   All I did was follow your assumption that we can apply formal therapeutic methods to the messy world and reach conclusions, and I showed the opposite of what you're suggesting.   Concerning flooding, I don't know enough about the topic and recent developments to comment about the matter and whether the lack of trigger warnings can be assimilated to flooding therapy.   No, you misunderstood. I don't want the methods assimilated into flooding therapy because that therapy shouldn't be used. It's extremely dangerous and is known to have a number of negative outcomes.  What I'm saying is that your proposal to remove trigger warnings is effectively a form of flooding therapy. You immerse the patient in the triggering stimuli and you force them to re-experience the pain until they eventually habituate to it.    I generally wouldn't mind and I understand where you're coming from, but considering the lively nature of the conversations in this thread, I'd like not to risk coloring the interactions here to keep the conversation centered upon the arguments and information we have to share.   That's fine but I'll be honest, I'm doubting that you have the necessary qualifications to make the claims you have and I really don't think your contributions here have been to the standard that the sub requires. I know that probably makes me sound like a dick and I'm not personally attacking you here, I just think the information in your comments is incredibly misinformed.   It just reads more like the anti-science stuff that TiA comes out with sometimes and I think with a topic as sensitive as this the sub needs a little more rigor."

There are plenty of testimonials of people with PTSD who found avoidance strategies are simply necessary to manage and survive the mental illness. The null hypothesis for how to treat people with PTSD isn't ""ignore what they say they want until proven otherwise."" The PTSD community has created trigger warnings as a tool to help themselves, and it behooves the rest of society to accommodate them as we would any disability, not shrug and decide we know what's best for them until the self-proclaimed ""objective experts"" of the medical community have conducted sufficient multivariate statistics to try and tease out a near impossible proof of causation.  And--reducing quality of life? How is providing people with optional information reducing the quality of life for anyone else involved? We already have rating systems in place that require films and other types of media to report the presence or absence of violence, sex, etc. All trigger warnings are purporting to do is provide people with PTSD with information they are actively asking for. The idea that we need to ""prove"" that withholding it would damage their recovery is an absurd standard, and beyond the pale of human decency."

Furthermore, what kind of warning would be sufficiently innocuous, when even neutral events could potentially be a trigger? Data would be needed to judge whether any of this is true, false, partially true, if the benefits trump the drawbacks, what works or doesn't work. But I'd say that the matter of feasibility remains, nonetheless, and I remain skeptic that it's a functional solution, as these ""triggers"" are linked to specific sensory experiences related with personal histories which makes me question the balance in quality of life (e.g. avoiding labelled triggers which could actually not really be triggers for you, thus limiting your options, opportunities and experiences)."

That's not what I meant in the slightest. I was talking about legislation in the vein of legally mandated warning labels on products potentially containing known common allergens.   How much censorship would that take?   What the hell? How does censorship even come into this? Trigger warnings don't stop people discussing things, it just means prefacing something with a warning. If anything, that makes more discussion of sensitive topics possible.   It's impossible to know what may or may not be a ""trigger"" for someone else.   As me and other people have pointed out several times in this thread, a whole bunch of very common triggers are easily knowable. The point isn't to have 100% coverage, but to cover common triggers to make discussion of those topics possible without necessarily causing adverse effects for trauma victims. You don't get better from PTSD by randomly and unpredictably being triggered loads of times and being left a nervous wreck.   People don't get better when they run from the pain, or refuse to face what's happened.   Exposure therapy is definitely helpful and a common therapeutic route, but not necessarily in all cases. But furthermore, exposure therapy demands a controlled environment. Trigger warnings help create that. That's it - they're supposed to be a helpful tool for people still suffering from PTSD. They do not replace the healing process, nor were they ever meant to.  Seriously, did you even bother to read anything I or people arguing along similar lines argued?

AskSocialScience,367a3t,TheSpaceWhale,10,Sun May 17 01:27:47 2015 UTC,"Nothing; the effectiveness of ""trigger warnings"" can't be assessed because you can't experiment with them in effectively. There's no way to divide trauma survivors into two groups and say, OK: you half go out and get trigger warnings for everything that's likely to trigger a re-traumatization and then decide if you want to experience that, and you half go out and just get hit with triggers willy-nilly. Just not possible.  There IS literature about avoidance coping strategies effects on PTSD, however. Even here though the exact relationships and causes are hard to distinguish. Avoiding re-traumatizing triggers is certainly well correlated with poor recovery from PTSD, but it goes both ways--people have high avoidance because their PTSD is bad, and people with high avoidance have a harder time recovering from their PTSD. And on top of that, there haven't been that many solid studies and sample sizes have been small (citation).  To date there have been mixed results, with some studies suggesting avoidance can increase treatment's effectiveness ( example) while others have found it can decrease treatment's effectiveness (example). Again, these are all correlative however; and differ in their subjects and the types of trauma. Avoidance for rape victims, who are likely to express the threat of sexual violence in everyday life, may function differently than avoidance for veterans who have returned to civilian life.  And lastly, exposure therapy (in controlled settings) can definitely be helpful, but it is not the only type of therapy. There's also CBT, EMDR, etc., none of which include exposure. And whether someone who has undergone traumatic experiences and developed PTSD wishes to engage in avoidance behaviors should be up to them and their therapist, and tailored to the specific circumstances of their life--not determined by the court of public opinion. Ultimately, trigger warnings simply give the tools to decide about avoidance as a coping strategy in their hands, where it should be. As the specialists in their own & their patient's treatments, it is best for them to be making those calls."
AskSocialScience,367a3t,Kraftz,2,Sun May 17 01:38:55 2015 UTC,Cognitive Behavorial Therapy most certainly counts exposure amongst its techniques. Exposure therapy is just a form of CBT. Using exposure in CBT to cure acrophobia is a classic example.

As I mention in my reply to you above, you can have unexpected exposure and you can have exposure that comes after a warning. The former is what we call ""flooding"" and is an extremely dangerous approach, and the latter is ""systematic desensitisation"", which is the standard approach to exposure therapy. Flooding would be having no trigger warnings, whereas trigger warnings more closely resemble the procedures behind systematic desensitisation."

One aspect to the problem is that Asian Americans are perceived as being less-competent leaders than White Americans, and because of such perceptions are promoted less often. First, this is despite the ""Model Minority"" stereotype where AAs perform better academically or technically. Second, these biases often occur unconciously. Third, this stereotype has been, according to the study, internalized by many AAs; this is in part due to a lack of role models for aspiring Asian American leaders.  To quote:   “The stereotype in the workforce is that Asian Amercians are great workers, not great leaders,” [Thomas] Sy added. “In the Western world, the ideal leadership prototype is charismatic, which is associated with Caucasians. Asians are perceived as competent, intelligent and dedicated, but lack the perception of charisma needed to be viewed as strong leaders.”   (Unfortunately, I cannot access the article itself as it is behind a paywall.)"
AskSocialScience,366zi2,ice_cold_fahrenheit,5,Sun May 17 17:54:36 2015 UTC,"While there may be some Asian Americans in media and politics, there is still clear underrepresentation. For instance:   According to Screen Actors Guild casting data reports, only 3.8% of all television and theatrical roles were portrayed by Asian Pacific Islander actors in 2008, compared to 6.4% portrayed by Latino actors, 13.3% portrayed by African Americans and 72.5% portrayed by Caucasian actors.   http://www.sagaftra.org/shattering-asian-american-stereotypes   Although Asians make up five percent of people in the US, in 2011, they only accounted for two percent of all television representations. The combination of the small number of Asian Americans in mass media, along with stereotypical representations, work to feed these stereotypes.   http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/12/asian-americans-myth-reality-201312236385578609.html  That said, underrepresentation is not only quantified by the low numbers of Asian Americans in media. It's also shown by the preponderance of stereotypes in American media. Three papers that analyze the presence of these stereotypes include this one by Ling-hsuan Tung, this thesis by Emily Wo, and this one by Audrey Kwak. In particular, this line from the last paper is particularly interesting with regards to Vladith's question:   For children, the visual absence of Asian Americans on television establishes subconscious conclusions of what one can and cannot be—actors, anchormen, and women—and perceptions of what one is—studious, exotic, nerdy.   In other words, the paper implies that part of the reason that there is not such a large presence of AAs in media (and in politics) is that AAs are not portrayed as being in media, politics, or similar positions very often in the media. Instead, most AAs are portrayed as being ""math nerds"" and as other such negative stereotypes, which can influence AAs on what they can and cannot be negatively.  In conclusion, it is a good thing that there are prominent Asian Americans in American society; however, as Vladith and I pointed out, there is not enough, proportional to their representation. In addition, negative stereotypes about Asians and Asian Americans continue to be prevalent in American media, which is a likely factor in the aforementioned limited representation."
AskSocialScience,366zi2,ice_cold_fahrenheit,5,Sun May 17 02:16:24 2015 UTC,"In your first paragraph you say that there's under-representation of Asians. Yet, if we look at the numbers, Caucasians are 72.5% of actors, and 72.4% of the population.  So it's not like there's this huge disparity where white people (which could be presented as ""privileged"" and perhaps in control of the media), are over-represented in said media by a big percentage.  And also, 3.8% is under-representative, it'd probably be better if it adjusted with time, but, you know, it's 0.9% we are talking here. For a country that was 88% white 50 years ago. I don't think America is horribly and hugely behind on this.  And the non-white Hispanics are the ones that are seriously under-represented if we want to look for ""injustice"" here in my opinion, (a whole 10%)  but you may disagree.  But then the other thing about screen appearances is more serious. Two percent, if that number is correct, would be like if white people only had 35% of screen appearances.  Here's a question, to what point do peoples need to be represented in media and government? I'm not trying to be offensive or anything, but hear me out, for example I'm Mexican, and I do believe representation is important, there would be something immoral in a government that is 100% male for example.   But it gets tricky, about 2% of our population speaks Nahua, should they have 2% of jobs in media? About 1% speak Maya, so same deal? And then Zapotec, Mixtec, Otomi, Totonac, Tzotzil, Tzeltal, Mazahua, Mazatec, Huatec, Ch'ol, Chinantec, and Puerepecha speakers also have at least a fraction of a percentage.   Should they be proportionally represented? I mean, I of course would think its a good thing if it happened, but should we push for it, and think its a bad thing if say, huastec people had 2 percent more than their allotance?  Or how about a million and a half Mexicans of French descent? Should they also need to be like proyected unto postions? Or are they white and either don't matter of don't need tending to?  I also don't know about throwing in all Asians together, like you could possibly find certain groups, like I'm going to theorize the Japanese, because of their media powerhouse status, could be over represented, and say, Sri Lankans not at all.  To that point, not all white people are culturally the same, and I prefer to approach diversity from a cultural standpoint, seems less racist to me, and more applicable in some cases, so should we care if Polish people were to be underrepresented?   39% of the students enrolled in Berkley CA are Asians, should they drop to 8% that's the percentage of Asians living in Berkley? Or to the national 4.7? IS there something wrong and immoral with American Brazilians not holding 0.11% of media and politics positions?  Is there such a thing as an ethnic or cultural or otherwise distinct group not seeking their part? Say, maybe the Amish. Is there anything wrong with that? Do other communities vary in the degree with which they pursue jobs in media and politics? Or is prejudice a still more important factor?  Ideas, thoughts?

That said, the argument is not necessarily whether the ethnic composition in media, politics, etc. need to match that of the population at large exactly.

""I use a type of body metaphor in the term ""systemic racism"", which I consider the best overview term for this centuries-old oppression.""

Racism is the deterministic belief-system which sustains racialism, linking these characteristics with negatively valuated social, psychological, or physical traits."" (Scott & Marshall, 2009)   Institutional Racism  I think the International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavorial Sciences has a good and concise definition of institutional racism:   (d) ""[Racism] [a]s a set of practices or institutions, divorced from individual beliefs or attitudes, that, by design or otherwise, have a differential impact on various racial or ethnic groups. This is usually labeled ‘institutional racism,’ and is a synonym for discrimination, witting or unwitting. Thus, an ostensibly neutral test on which some groups consistently perform better than others is said to be ‘institutionally racist.’"" (van den Berghe, 2001)   An important notion to be careful about is that when talking about institutional racism, is that it doesn’t necessarily mean intentional racism: ""[a] long tradition of studies in sociology has shown that discrimination against some groups in society can result from the majority simply adhering unthinkingly to the existing organizational and institutional rules or social norms"" (Scott & Marshall, 2009).  You’ll find these same notions elsewhere: ""its two main points [...] are, first, that actions may regularly have inadvertent and unintended consequences [...] and, second, that the effects of an organisation's operations are often other than those desired by any or all of the individuals who comprise it"" (Bruce & Yearley, 2006).  Structural Racism  As far as I know, it’s not really a fully defined concept per sé. I’ve seen it both used as a synonymous for systemic racism, and for institutional racism, for example:   However, racism can also be embedded in the institutions and structures of social life. This type of racism can be called structural or institutional racism (hereafter, institutional racism) and it is significant in creating and maintaining the disparate outcomes that characterize the landscape of racial inequality.

AskSocialScience,365hvo,Kraftz,18,Sat May 16 13:26:22 2015 UTC,"Some activists and academics have tried to use separate definitions of ""racism"" and ""racial prejudice"" by restricting ""racism"" to ""privilege + power"". This is obviously quite contentious, with some people arguing that it's both true and necessary, and some people arguing that it's arbitrary, grating, and alienating to lay readers. Do any of these definitions try to do that?  It seems unnecessary once you are already separating ""systemic racism"" from ""non-systemic racism"" to also separate out racism that uses power from racial prejudice that doesn't."
AskSocialScience,365hvo,yodatsracist,12,Sat May 16 15:07:31 2015 UTC,"My answer:  Except for systemic racism, I'd say that the other definitions I have quoted describe the actions, attitudes or consequences of what is defined as [insert type] racism rather than the characteristics (such as privilege or power) of the perpetrator.  Feagin's systemic racism is a theory rather than a definition, as it tries to explain a specific situation in America which is said to be the cause of wide-ranging deeply rooted inequality. I would say that his theory goes along with the concept of White Privilege, towards which Jon Feagin is sympathetic.  Racism, in its general form, in itself is already a specialized definition of prejudice: ""[w]hen race, other  groups,  sex,  or  sexual  preferences,  for instance, are the targets of prejudice, it will be labeled racism, ethnocentrism, sexism, or homophobia"" (Leyens, 2001).  While prejudice is defined as the ensemble of beliefs and attitudes towards another person because they are perceived as belonging to a different group, racism is the ensemble of beliefs and attitudes towards another person because of their membership to what is categorized as a race, with this distinction being related to history. (Leyens, 2001; Jennings, 2007; van den Berghe, 2007). I don't see the use of redefining racism and creating a third word for the specialized form of prejudice, other than creating further confusion.  Personal commentary:  What follows now are more personal musings: I believe that definitions should be useful and that definitions for concepts such as racism, sexism, forms of criminality (in other words, definitions that aren’t about a category of person) should describe what they are, rather than who supposedly can enact it, as I've said elsewhere on this subreddit, otherwise they’re useless and untestable:  Ex. Let's for example study ""privilege + power = racism"". Privilege and Power should be independent variables that may or may not be related to Racism, the dependent variable. Defining racism as privilege + power equals to having the IVs in the DV, which means we have a definition that is tautological, and thus useless and irrefutable: each time you measure racism, you're measuring privilege and power, by definition.   Which creates the absurd situation where a Black person can fulfill the attitudes and/or actions of racism while not being measured as a racist. It's simply contrary to the principles of social science. We could create the new category of ""racial prejudicist"" and say this Black person would be measured as such, but I fail to use the usefulness of this further complication.   I believe we could easily keep the concepts of racism, privilege and power separate and study them in interaction amongst themselves, rather than compacting it all into racism, while still being able to argue (for example) that a dominating majority can be a greater beneficiary of racism because of greater amounts of privilege and power.  On the matter, I'd like to quote van den Berghe in the context of describing the evolution of the sociological concept of racism and the acceptance of the concept of institutional racism:   ""The stage was now set for the transformation of racism from a relatively precise analytical concept to an elastic term of opprobrium applied to almost any thing one disapproved of. Lucid analysis of complex multicultural and/or multiracial societies all too often yielded to ideologically inspired mush.""   I believe that trying to redefine racism based upon who supposedly can be racist just contributes to what van den Berghe's calls a ""sociologically constructed confusion"" and that by compacting ""privilege + power"" into racism pushes the concept even farther from a precise analytical concept.   It make sense to define a white person for the characteristics of the person defined as white, because it’s a definition of “who”. It doesn’t make sense to make a definition of “what” in a mix-match of who and what.  Sources:   Jennings, L. (2007). Prejudice. In G.

But you can hardly say they were the same even though by using the sociologist definition it was institutional antisemitism. The same can be said about racism in America. Racism is a belief or ideology. Discrimination is the result of that, no matter what form it takes. Whether that's institutional like racial segregation or personal ie ""I won't hire him because of his skin color"".  When you redefine discrimination as ""institutional racism"" it allows for nonsense beliefs to arise such as, ""In America minorities cannot be racist.""

It can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people.   That's the earliest definition I know of. The term itself was used (and introduced) in the 1960s by Black Power activist Stokely Carmichael: ""It is a call for black people to begin to define their own goals, to lead their own organizations. It is a call to reject the racist institutions and values of this society"". (Carmichael, 1967, quoted by McCormack)  Concerning your other comments, I believe that the concept of institutional racism mainly describes a consequence of attitudes and practices. An illustrating example I've found about institutional racism is how ""having a minimum height barrier may effectively discriminate against an ethnic minority though that was never its intention"" (Bruce and Yearley, 2006).  But yes, I would be careful not to make discrimination and racism a single concept, as indeed discrimination ""refers to the differential, and often unequal, treatment of people who have been either formally or informally grouped into a particular class of persons. There are many forms of discrimination that are specified according to the ways in which particular groups are identified, including race, ethnicity, [...]"" (Law, 2007) while racism refers to attitudes, ideologies, beliefs towards perceived members of another race. But, it is difficult to imagine those two not being strongly related (e.g. being racist without discriminating).  I guess it could be argued that it'd be more appropriate to call institutional racism as institutional racial discrimination (or institutional racialism) because it different from other definitions of racism. The term itself is alas, fruit of its context.  That said, I believe antisemitism isn't synonymous to ""racism towards Jews"", but that it's a larger concept which defines both prejudice and discrimination towards Jews.

Even if we talk ideology, your statement isn't true. I believe you are thinking of Marxism–Leninism (what most people mean when they talk about communism), which was the foundation of the Russian revolutionary movement to establish a ""dictatorship of the proletariat.""  Ideological marxists were opposed to the soviet union. The ""Mensheviks,"" who were orthodox Marxists, believed that Russia needed to experience a capitalist revolution before any socialist movement could be a success. Thus orthodox Marxists such as the Mensheviks were more center-left ideologicaly. On the other hand, the Marxist-Leninist Bolsheviks were ideologically far-left.  TL;DR, ideological orthodox Marxism was more of a center-left political movement. Fascism is generally considered a far-right political ideology.

And in some senses they are a centre-left party, but that's exactly the problem with the Mensheviks they weren't really Marxists at all. Just as social democrats aren't Marxists at all. After all both social democrats (in the modern sense) and Mensheviks hold about the same view towards revolution and participation and cooperation with 'bourgeoisie parties'. To cast Leninism as far-left is problematic indeed. In fact in many cases - partially brought about by power - Lenin abandoned Marx's ideas to take a more authoritarian approach. The better Marxists and the more orthodox ones in 1917 were to the left of Lenin, and what he attacked in his pamphlet 'Left-wing communism: an infantile disorder' (i.e. those such as a the workers opposition. On such question as the national question, unions, labour, workers-control, and anarchists, Lenin took an authoritarian and increasingly cynical stance. Of course Lenin's problematic interpretation of Marx was partially because he didn't have access to the many early writings of Marx which are generally more humanist in character, Lenin also tended to have a problematic understanding of Hegel (partially because he didn't have access to Marx's early critiques of him).  tldr; orthodox Marxism isn't a centre-left political movement at all. Marx and Engels continually confirmed their commitment to world revolution; to the abolition of classes, the state, property, money and so on. A revolution which was in their eyes no a slow process but the final situaiton in the class struggle brought by the demonstrable activity of the working-class. The ideas of the mensheviks, and the social democrats of centre-left fabian parties around Europe and contemporary to Marx were not Marxists at all. In fact Marx consistently attacked them (for example critique of the gotha programme, or critique of french socialists) in which he openly said famously 'if this is Marxism. I am not a Marxist'. Which shows how soon his ideas were being put to misuse by all sorts of 'progressives', liberals, reactionaries.

I'm happy to share my limited knowledge but someone with a background in history or education might be able to give you a far better answer.  As far as recent history, both the Common Core State Standards Initiative and No Child Left Behind put an emphasis on improving in language arts and mathematics. NCLB in particular calls for yearly standardized testing, as well as requiring a certain level of improvement.    Common Core site   For the origins of that emphasis, we can go back to the foundation of American public schools in the mid-19th century. Horace Mann, one of the early proponents of centralized, public education, documented some of the successful features of European schools. The Prussian system, of which Mann was particularly enamored, featured reading, writing, grammar, geography, arithmetic, music, and Bible study (Brickman 2010, 52). The importation of the continental European model was an effort simply to improve general literacy and knowledge (Groen 2008, 254).   With that in mind, let's fast forward roughly a century to the adoption of the Scholastic Aptitude Test, or SAT, in 1926. The SAT was intended to measure aptitude rather than specific knowledge, like history or geography, which are dependent on memory, not analytical ability (Atkinson and Geiser 2009, 666). The way the SAT accomplished that was by focusing on reading comprehension and grammar (with the text provided by the test) and on mathematics.  Given that American schools are required to demonstrate student improvements in those two core areas (English language arts and maths), as well as needing to place students into post-secondary schools, it makes sense that the emphasis is often placed on reading and math, to the unfortunate detriment of other areas.  All that said, there are notable exceptions. The General Educational Development (GED) test has four sections: Language Arts, Math, Science, and Social Studies. The College Board provides testing on a variety of subjects, in the form of Advanced Placement (AP) exams, SAT Subject Tests, and College Level Examination Program (CLEP) tests. Additionally, some schools are either considering or have already dropped the ACT/SAT from admission requirements, as a student's high school record has a higher correlation to success in higher education than standardized test scores (Atkinson and Geiser 2009, 666). Reading and math are easier to measure, but universities are increasingly trying to take a more holistic approach.   Atkinson, R. C., & Geiser, S. (2009).

Here's some of the major factors I can identify based on my experience (I played collegiate and nearly pro soccer and have played in about 8 different countries; currently now a researcher in international education).  To iterate the obvious: Political Rivalries. Remember that many of these clubs ARE ACTUALLY OLDER THAN THE COUNTRY they are currently in (if you go by the current regime/political system). This spills over in to many areas.   A. Religious (e.g. Celtic - Rangers) B. Ethnic (AC Milan - Inter Milan: inter's name actually comes from the fact that AC Milan for a long time did not allow foreign players and internazionale did. Ethnocentrism and racism were part of AC Milan's identity for a long time, and some might even argue up until today given Berlusconi's politics. C. Going further with Milan, these clubs are so deeply embedded into the culture that, for example, berlusconi's ownership of AC Milan brought him to the office of PM of the COUNTRY. This can happen in american sports, but much more rarely. Also:      Rival teams often share the very same stadium (or at least they used to). The leagues are often much older and have zero to few expansion teams. When was the last time a 'new' english club was in the EPL? It's difficult to be willing to riot over your team when they didnt even exist 5 years ago. Geographic proximity. Especially in european soccer where countries are small and team alliegiances date much further back in the lives of the fans, there's plenty of supporters willing to travel to away games. Besides for say the RedSox and Yankees, there are very  MLB teams that BRING any significant amount of fans with them. There might BE some Mets fans AT a marlins game, but it's pretty unlikely they traveled there FOR the game and are bringing busloads of boozed up rowdy supporters with them. Maybe a lower Drinking Age in europe. For many, football fandom and booze are very enmeshed and all the 18 year olds in attendance (if not younger) have access to pretty much as much alcohol as they want. Not the case in the US. While there is no doubt excessive drinking at american sports contests, is it possible that those who are likely to overindulge are generally not from the same demographic of people that would travel from baltimore for houston for a single game? I.e. those who can afford to buy a RT plane ticket and hotel and game tix for a weekend vs. those who would black out and start a riot. In fact, I think there is a lot in this answer given the history of the EPL. as ticket prices skyrockets, hooliganism has declined noticeably (though correlation is not necessarily causation).  Stadium Location. In most european soccer stadiums I've been to, the stadiums have been within walking distance (or public transportation routes) of the main city and supporters area, thus integrating the game and the ""extra-curricular activities"" more closely. When you have to DRIVE 30 minutes outside the city to get to a game, is it possible that it becomes less conducive to hooliganism? There are way more american sports (and therefore teams) at the top level than there are in europe. is it possible that city and cultural identity is not as closely tied with the team in the states as it is in europe. As such, many these clubs are often TRULY CLUBS that locals belong to and work out at or watch volleyball and handball matches and invite friends over for tennis and a beer. Many (most?) european clubs have tons of members who actually treat it like a social club. Even when I was young and playing soccer in a portuguese league I experienced a culture like this (and from a relatively sheltered kid from the suburbs it was an odd surprise!) but there is a much bigger culture and identity association between the sport and the members."

At the same time barcelona people think of madrid as this epicenter of fascism and right wing thinking, a city that represents this image of top percentage rich assholes that are completely anti-liberal. Now, maybe to an american that doesnt sound THAT bad, but you have to consider in spain there is still a deep stigma against nationalism because of the franco era. You'll rarely see spanish flags just hanging around in non-offical buildings unless spain is the world cup finals or some shit.

AskSocialScience,3620om,whirlpool138,5,Fri May 15 14:37:45 2015 UTC,"I think it might be particular to the region and how close the teams are geographically to each other. North America is just too big to have a strong consistent rivalry  against the city next door, but it does happen. For instance, one of the biggest rivalries in North American sports is the Buffalo Sabres vs the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey teams (often called the Battle of Lake Ontario or the QEW). Since Buffalo and Toronto are so close to each other (roughly two hours away), it's very easy for fights to break out before/after games and in the stands. On top of that, Toronto and Buffalo were both burnt down by the opposing country during the War of 1812. Each team's fans have earned a pretty bad reputation for going across the border en mass and taking over parking lots, restaurants, bars and sections of the arena when the two teams are playing a game in order to try and instigate a fight (especially when their team isn't doing well). There was even a reoccurring problem where Maple Leafs fans would throw their jerseys on to the ice in order to slow the game play once their team started to nose dive and lose. Buffalo fans are notorious as being hooligans that start fights both in the NHL and the NFL.  It even got to the point where the Buffalo Sabres raised the ticket prices on Maple Leafs games to try and stop their fans from gobbling up significant amount of the arena seats along with lower the risk of fights breaking out (Maple Leafs home games are also significantly more expensive than they are at the Sabres arena, leading to another reason for more fans to cross over the border, resulting in even more problems).   I am sure that there are other sports teams across the different leagues that face similar issues to this that I'm not as familiar with. Europe is smaller and has more densely populated areas, possibly making it just easier for fans to follow their particular sports team and come into contact with their rivals. You don't see a lot of teams located geographically close to each other so it reduces the amount of chance for an incident to break out. Local rivalries are more likely to happen in College Football, especially down South, where the teams are located very close together and fan bases are built on strong regional pride.  http://thehockeywriters.com/sabres-vs-leafs-historic-rivalry/  http://bleacherreport.com/articles/322812-buffalo-sabres-versus-toronto-maple-leafs-one-passionate-rivalry"

Many beliefs are tied up with a certain worldview (research shows that if someone believes any given conspiracy theory, they're more likely to believe any other one--the content almost doesn't matter; look up work by Brotherton or Lewandowsky). Beliefs are also emotional and cultural--they allow us to self-identify as part of a group, or as a certain kind of person. Challenging these kinds of beliefs with evidence doesn't do anything except threaten how a person sees themselves.  Festinger wrote about this as cognitive dissonance, where when experience conflicts with an important belief we will discount the evidence to protect ourselves. He famously observed this amongst members of a doomsday cult--after their doomsday had passed uneventfully. He wrote about that in When Prophecy Fails.  Basically, evidence doesn't change beliefs that aren't held because of evidence."

""Conspiracy theory"" as we colloquially use it is not an easy thing to define, and researchers have proposed a number of definitions. Historians, political scientists and philosophers have their own takes; one that was pretty influential was by philosopher Brian Keeley. He clarifies that when we say conspiracy theory we tend to mean an ""unwarranted"" conspiracy theory. The proposed explanation for some event runs counter to the official or ""obvious"" account, and the fact that it doesn't jibe with evidence is explained away by reference to nefarious persons who sow misinformation. It's not just that there were conspirators, it's that these conspirators have the power to shape public perception to such an extent that the evidence cannot be trusted.  In psychological research, researchers highlight other characteristics, like how these kinds of theories encompass a really large amount of seemingly disconnected events--they tend to be very wide-reaching (""It's bigger then all of us, maan!"")--, and how they assume that events which many would call accidental were actually intentional, and intended for the benefit of some conspirators.  So yes, good catch--maybe we should more widely use Keeley's acronym UCT, for unwarranted conspiracy theory, to be more clear that we mean that kind of all-encompassing, can't-trust-anything theory."

AskSocialScience,35xrah,RobMagus,4,Thu May 14 18:24:07 2015 UTC,"Well, part of it is the attitude with which people approach the discussion. This is a sketch of how it might go:  A: ""Your worldview is wrong! Something personal to you is not right.""  B: ""Why would you say that?! There's nothing wrong with me!""  A: ""This evidence proves it.""  B: ""Screw you, I don't believe you! How can something so obvious and so core to my belief system be wrong? Obviously, -you're- the one that's wrong.""  To a certain extent, the problem is A's approach as much as B's beliefs. A shows no interest in why B cares about these beliefs, and is only concerned with being right. Well, so is B--everyone wants to be right about things that matter.  There's a field of research on ""debiasing"" that explores how approaches other than ""look at this contradictory evidence!"" influence people's beliefs and their ability to reduce bias. A main finding from this research is that deliberately thinking the topic through a different viewpoint can help. A keyword to search for is ""consider the alternative"" approaches. There's also evidence that better self-knowledge about how we've formed our beliefs can help us change them. This is part of what makes CBT and psychodynamic therapy effective. Mindfulness meditation can also help people identify and reduce bias, possibly through this mechanism of increased awareness.  This was illustrated recently on This American Life (or maybe it was Planet Money) in a story about political pollsters. They would go door-to-door and interview people about their views on gay marriage abortion, with the intention of changing the mind of the person if they didn't support it. Instead of just presenting standard evidence and talking points, they chatted with the person with an eye to sharing personal stories, genuinely listening and trying to understand why they had their opinion. Crucially, when the pollster has personally impacted by the issue (either they've had an abortion or were gay and wanted to marry their partner), the person they were talking to had a good likelihood of changing their mind to support the issue, even if they outright refused at the beginning of the conversation.  It's not about ""correcting""--it's about understanding."
AskSocialScience,35xrah,ademnus,1 point,Thu May 14 18:45:17 2015 UTC,"I definitely see that the confrontational approach never works. It can serve to end the conversation because when you deliver enough incontrovertible proof the other person tends to withdraw but not concede. As you say, everyone wants to be right and if they cannot be right by virtue of an obviously verified contradictory position they will slam the door shut on it. It definitely makes sense that reaching them as a person and making a personal connection to the issues is more productive than an adversarial competition.  But what do you do when the person with whom you are discussing an issue is purposely trying to obfuscate the facts to promote an agenda and other people who are innocently misinformed are watching?  I'll give you an example, but to keep us from any rabbit holes, a non-political one. I had been discussing, or trying to discuss, a conclusion I drew in a science discussion sub. I was told, incorrectly, that no scientist had ever drawn that conclusion and no work of any kind was being done in that arena. It didn't take long to find articles about specific scientists currently working on the exact same theory. When I presented them, the source was invalidated as ""pop sci."" The reality is, the scientific content of the article was not in question, was not the reason it was proffered, but rather the information about the scientists and their theory. If you want to debate the science, that's one thing, but if you want to say numerous articles that name the same professors and researchers are lying and those individuals either do not exist or are not working on such things (which a review of their own university web pages showed they were, but that was ignored) then you could surely win some money in a lawsuit. After awhile, it became obvious they were just saying anything to derail the overall point.  Now, in a debate like that, there's ultimately no ill-consequences outside of reinforcing cognitive dissonance or undermining critical thinking. But when we are discussing politics and these sorts of tactics get used, often people's lives and livelihoods are at stake. In the political arena, often many people are watching and listening and they aren't all purposely trying to ""just win"" but they are, like in the example you use, they just have beliefs they have not questioned before, without ulterior agenda. In that instance, we can't just walk away deciding there is no merit in arguing with an intractable brick wall because then that audience has no opportunity to see the opposing view and its arguments.

If you have a minor episode of depression, for example, therapy by itself may be all you need. More serious disorders may not show any benefit from therapy without strong anti-psychotics being used concurrently.  Honestly, the truth is we don't know a great deal about why various pills work in psychological treatments. We know chemically what the pills do, but not why they help. In fact, many of the drugs used to treat psychological disorders were only discovered to help due to side effects, rather than it being the original intent of the drug.  In terms of the older psychologists, they're primarily taught as historical figures within the field. It would be similar to how you might study Caesar because he was an interesting historical character, but you probably won't try to use his tactics and leadership style as a model for how society should be run.  Freud is widely praised for his influence in the field and his overall impact on the field of psychology, especially for his role in popularizing psychology. But almost all of this theories have been debunked by this point and he is recognized for being a bit of a nut. Intro Psyc students will learn about his Id, Ego, and Superego ideas, but only as a ""this is what we used to think"" type of exercise rather than anything that should be taken literal and is applicable today. Jung's ideas weren't as far fetched as Freud, so his ideas still hold a bit more water, but the field has advanced so much since then that you would rarely see either of them cited in a paper published nowadays except in the context of providing a historical citation. Even someone like Skinner, whose work is still very much on point, is not really cited since we know so much more about behavior and conditioning than when he did his seminal work.  Psychoanalysis, which was a type of therapy developed by Freud, still has some niche popularity and you can find some psychologists still practicing it, but it has largely been replaced by more popular and effective methods, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).

What do modern psychologists think of the ""great"" original therapists, ie Freud, Jung, etc?   Well, I believe that your question is too large and vague because there are several authors that could be considered great pioneers depending on the field. Freud is the father of psychanalysis, while for example Carl Rogers is arguably the father of the humanistic school of psychotherapies and multiple fathers can be found for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.  Limiting myself to Freud, he's a historical figure who is recognized for having popularized the idea that humans have an irrational part, that there exists an unconscious that escapes our control and which can influence our behavior. Other than that, Freud and Psychoanalysis have been abandoned by psychology: his theories lack empirical foundation and his concepts are often tautological and cannot be verified or refuted. Nonetheless, his ideas have been developed upon and reworked by his disciples (such as Jung, Adler and Lacan) and amongst the major schools of psychotherapy we can find psychodynamics which takes inspiration from the psychoanalytic approach.  Sources (1):   Richard, M. (1994). Les courants de la psychologie. Lyon: Éditions Chronique Sociale.    Does therapy work better than pills, or viceversa?   The general consensus is that psychotherapy works at least as well as pills.  The American Psychological Association considers that psychotherapy has ""significant and large"" general or average effects, but furthermore ""the results of psychotherapy tend to last longer and be less likely to require additional treatment courses than psychopharmacological treatments"" (APA, 2012).  According to Wampold (2010), psychotherapy has ""demonstrably large benefits"" and its effectiveness ""exceeds that of many accepted medical practices"". Wampold cites the meta-analyses done by Smith and Glass, who compared those who received psychotherapy with a no-treatment group, finding an effect size estimate of .80 (Smith & Glass, 1977; Smith, Glass & Miller, 1980), which means that ""the average client receiving a treatment would be better off than about 79% of untreated clients"" (Wampold, 2010). To put this number in perspective, according to Turner et al. (2008) antidepressant medication has an effect size of 0.31. In this case, it would seem that psychotherapy is better than antidepressants.  We can also convert this effect size into an index that is more commonly used by Evidence-Based Medicine, the number needed for treat index (NNT). The NNT is ""the number of patients you need to treat to prevent one additional bad outcome"" (University of Toronto's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine). By referring to Kreaemer & Kupfer (2006), Wampold (2007) states that an effect size of .80 can be converted to an NNT of 3, which means that you have to treat 3 clients with psychotherapy to prevent one additional bad outcome.   We can compare the NNT for psychotherapy and the NNT of several medical interventions listed on the University of Toronto's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine website. After doing so, Wampold (2007) affirms that ""psychotherapy is more effective than many evidence-based medical practices, some of which are costly and produce significant side effects, including almost all interventions in cardiology [...], geriatric medicine [...], and asthma [...]; influenza vaccine; and cataract surgery, among other treatments"". In fact, for example, using beta-blockers in case of chronic heart failure has an NNT of 24 and using aspirin for cardiovascular events in treated hypertension has an NNT of 176.   Concerning mental health specifically, fluozetine (used to treat depression), has an NNT of 5, which is compatible with Wapold's (2010) review of literature, who concludes that psychotherapy is as effective as drug treatments for emotional problems, with the additional advantage of it being more enduring and creating less resistance to multiple administrations.  While psychotherapy isn't a panacea that works as well for all patients and as administered by all therapists, it ""compares well with established medical practices"" (Wampold, 2010). Furthermore, it may be impossible to being a therapy without first administering pills to stabilize the patient, in case of severe symptoms. And this is just considering general psychotherapy.

AskSocialScience,35w3bd,commentsrus,2,Thu May 14 00:13:31 2015 UTC,"The answer depends on how one defines ""mathematical economics"". Chiang's definition is rather general and would cover any research that uses mathematical tools. I'm not sure this is very useful way of looking at things today (Chiang's book was first published in 1967!), since almost all papers that are not purely empirical would fall into this category.  More narrow definition would cover only research that studies mathematical tools themselves. For example, a paper proving some property of general equilibrium in an abstract setting, or proposing and formally defining new equilibrium refinement in game theory, or providing a rigorous treatment of some modelling trick that economists use heuristically, would all fall under mathematical economics in my opinion. Tl;dr: if the paper contains actual theorems (compared to straightforward application of existing math), it's mathematical economics.  Needless to say, it's a pretty niche area, so you won't find it in AER, more likely in specialized journals like Journal of Economic Theory or Journal of Mathematical Economics.

A big thing is that the original question is asking about racism. I prefer avoiding that term entirely in the literature because it means so many different things to different people. Instead, the more scientific psychology and intergroup contact terms  are stereotype, prejudice, and discrimination. Each has its own distinct meaning and can be applied to any one on any basis. For instance, race-based stereotyping or gender-based discrimination have specific meanings and are much more descriptive than catch alls like ""sexism"" or ""racism.""  Now that I've made that distinction, to OPs questions. There is strong support, found through meta analytic reviews (e.g., Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006) , that increasing empathy decreases prejudice and discrimination. This can be done through a variety of ways, but this meta-analysis was interested in looking at many studies that looked at empathy (and other variables) as a mediator or explanation of a change in prejudice and discrimination following intergroup contact.

In this case, I am strongly convinced that the definition you've quoted has no value whatsoever in social science, made useless by the fact that it is blatantly based upon circular reasoning (""I cannot be racist towards a privileged group because only a member of a privileged group can be racist and I am not a member of a privileged group thus I cannot be racist"" which is just a fancier way to say ""I cannot be racist because I am not racist"").   It's the same error made when originally defining white collar crime as ""a crime committed by a person of respectability and high social status in the course of his occupation"", as Sutherland did, which has since been rejected as a definition by modern criminology. In fact, WCC isn't committed only by wealthy members of the elite, many white collar criminals are members of the middle class (Weisburd et al., 1991).  For racism, the International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavorial Sciences offers a non-exhaustive list of definitions according to current usage, which vary because of the different definitions of race (e.g. race as in ""the human race"", as in ""the Caucasoid race"", etc.):   (a) As an ideology or set of attitudes accompanying the second meaning of ‘race,’ that is, a belief in the relative inferiority or superiority in moral, intellectual, physical, and other attributes of biological subspecies of Homo sapiens.  (b) As an ideology or set of attitudes corresponding to the third meaning of ‘race,’ that is, as a synonym for ethnocentrism, as in the belief that one’s own ethnic group is superior to others.  (c) As an ideology or set of attitudes linked to the fourth meaning of ‘race,’ namely ‘social race.’  (d) As a set of practices or institutions, divorced from individual beliefs or attitudes, that, by design or otherwise, have a differential impact on various racial or ethnic groups. This is usually labeled ‘institutional racism,’ and is a synonym for discrimination, witting or unwitting. Thus, an ostensibly neutral test on which some groups consistently perform better than others is said to be ‘institutionally racist.’  (e) As a general term of opprobrium hurled at any person, policy, or practice one disapproves of. Examples would be the ‘Zionism is racism’ resolution passed by the United Nations, or accusations leveled at opponents of race-based affirmative action in the USA. In the latter case, and indeed in much contemporary usage in the USA, race-blindness is said to be racist, while race discrimination is defined as liberal, thus turning the concept on its head.   This is just to give a concrete example of how different definitions can exist in academia, but also to give an example of how these definitions differ from the one given by the Diversity Officer, as in they clearly define what action or attitude constitutes racism, rather than basing the definition on who commits it.  What I've said is applicable to sexism, and other -isms, too. There is no value in defining an -ism as what a specific category of person does, unless we want to create as many -isms as there are categories of people and variations therein of.

Basic social contract philosophy (Hobbes' Leviathan and Rousseau's Social contract). You abandon some liberty for some safety (defense from outside invaders, and now you could add defense from economic necessity through welfare state, or protection from bad health). The basic idea behind laws is that they apply to everyone : if I'm not allowed to kill my neighbour, he is less likely to do so as well.   So why did we have kings and stuff ? You could ask Max Weber, he would say that the kings were part of a tradition. Then you enter the terrifying world of sociology of institutions : why do we follow and believe in institutions ? Durkheim says that they are the prism through which you understand your own society and that their are necessary : you probably interpret things through democratic principles : that is because you believe they are a good institution, even though you vote for an elite and there are still people living in poverty in your own country. But you think Democracy is RIGHT. Because this and that. Doesn't matter, you believe in it. Being against democracy would be unacceptable.   You could see it from a Marxist perspective. Bourdieu would tell you that the dominant classes have set beliefs that everyone follows and everyone thinks are the best, but they are mostly used to keep the elites where they are. Take school : why is it that most rich kids succeed in school while poor kids are likelier to fail ? You might have a lot of excuses : Bourdieu would tell you that they are the elites' way of thinking, that they successfully put inside your brain through your habitus.   Socialisation plays a role : it's basically they way you were brought up by a variety of environments (the field that says that the environment and society dictate the way you think and understand is called structuralism). First level is : what your parents teach you. It might be that you have to find a job, obey, vote, etc. It's a deeply rooted set of beliefs. Second level is your school, your work environment. For example, one of school's purposes is to have you believe in a Nation, and if there is a Nation, it might be worth fighting for. So you believe in that, you think you should respect it as an institution. Can't remember the authors on education here although I think Piaget talked a bit about this. Socialisation is everywhere in sociology.   Voluntary servitude is a wide field of study. As to why people do ""the right thing"" and such, I would rather look at psychology and philosophy of ethics.  Hope it helped.

Motivations of Professional Strippers   Significant unexpected findings included the fact that strippers feel that their job is similar to service type jobs. Multivariate analyses revealed that strippers who discuss non-economic motivations also tended to express economic motivations. Strippers who did hold monetary motivations were very unlikely to participate in any extra sexual favors or go to any illegal extent to make money.

AskSocialScience,35pkan,exubereft,5,Wed May 13 23:45:41 2015 UTC,"You might find Temporarily Yours by Elizabeth Bernstein interesting.   Generations of social thinkers have assumed that access to legitimate paid employment and a decline in the ‘double standard’ would eliminate the reasons behind women’s participation in prostitution. Yet in both the developing world and in postindustrial cities of the West, sexual commerce has continued to flourish, diversifying along technological, spatial, and social lines. In this deeply engaging and theoretically provocative study, Elizabeth Bernstein examines the social features that undergird the expansion and diversification of commercialized sex, demonstrating the ways that postindustrial economic and cultural formations have spawned rapid and unforeseen changes in the forms, meanings, and spatial organization of sexual labor.  Drawing upon dynamic and innovative research with sex workers, their clients, and state actors, Bernstein argues that in cities such as San Francisco, Stockholm, and Amstersdam, the nature of what is purchased in commercial sexual encounters is also new. Rather than the expedient exchange of cash for sexual relations, what sex workers are increasingly paid to offer their clients is an erotic experience premised upon the performance of authentic interpersonal connection. As such, contemporary sex markets are emblematic of a cultural moment in which the boundaries between intimacy and commerce—and between public life and private—have been radically redrawn. Not simply a compelling exploration of the changing landscape of sex-work, Temporarily Yours ultimately lays bare the intimate intersections of political economy, desire, and culture."

Several studies have cited economic hardships or poverty as the main reason for women’s entry into sex work in India. While this may be true, it is still a vague reason. For better understanding and to develop meaningful intervention, we need to dig deeper and find more specific reasons for women’s entry into sex work. In addition, while most studies conducted among sex workers in India rely on survey-based approaches to explore women’s reasons for entry into sex work, there have been no studies to date which have used cultural biography to examine how sex work becomes a livelihood option for women in Indian society. Based on the analysis of the 46 short-life portraits and three life-history interviews collected from ‘flying’ or mobile female sex workers over a period of 7 months (December 2009–July 2010) in Kolkata, India, this paper examines the socio-cultural and economic factors that influence women’s decisions to enter into sex work. This study found that women choose sex work vis-à-vis other employment opportunities because it provides them with more freedom and autonomy over their bodies, higher earnings, flexible hours of work, and much flexibility to manage their dual responsibilities of a nurturer and provider. Because of this complex structure of causation, HIV prevention programs must address the larger issues of workplace sexual harassment, minimum living wage and child day care policy to disincentivize women’s entry into the sex industry.

They then continue the life-style as an adult.   ""Males prostitutes account for roughly 20% of the national prostitute population."" Many begin same as women, as teenage runaways. But they tend to get out earlier, by age 25, because on average they don't have a pimp. So from this it sounds like having a pimp keeps you in the game longer. Not sure if this helps answer your question, though, if you consider pimps as always coercive. But perhaps that would not be completely accurate to say, though.   ""Roughly 26% of New York City prostitutes were homeless and addicted to illicit drugs."" So they need the money. I'm wary of using this statistic since it's just NYC, and I'm trying to pull from a broader data set, though considering it's a major metropolis of a first-world country it might be statistically valid in representing elsewhere, though I don't know enough to assume that.     http://www.rapeis.org/activism/prostitution/prostitutionfacts.html  ""The Council for Prostitution Alternatives, Portland, Oregon Annual Report in 1991 stated that: 85% of prostitute/clients reported history of sexual abuse in childhood; 70% reported incest."" The article doesn't expound on how this may be a factor to starting and staying in prostitution, but I would guess the numbers speak to that--that a past history of sexual abuse is a factor for many.  ""85% of prostitutes are raped by pimps."" This shows how controlling pimps are, and how at least 85% have pimps. So of the 15% that don't--or don't have abusive pimps--well, we need more information!  I search on...  http://prostitutionresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/FarleyFranzblauKennedyOnlineTrafficking-2014.pdf (from here: http://prostitutionresearch.com/topic/prostitution/)  ""...on average 84% of women in prostitution are under third-party control or pimped or trafficked."" So again, the pimp factor (or outright trafficking). In this case, 16% may then be assumed to be independent. So what drives them?...  And FYI, here are some statistics from a footnote related to that 84% number: In the United States, 80–90% of those in prostitution had pimps. ... In New York City, a pimp estimated that “70% of women working in New York City as prostitutes are being compelled to do so by pimps who use beatings and drugs, and most importantly the threat of jail, to keep their girls in line.” ... In Italy, the European Union estimated that 80 % of those in prostitution were trafficked. ... In Poland, 90% of prostitution along the roads was assumed to be controlled by organized criminal groups. ... In Amsterdam 50 to 90% of women in prostitution in the red-light district were considered likely victims of Turkish, Hungarian, Romanian, and Bulgarian human trafficking networks, including those working in legal clubs and brothels, according to the Dutch national police Korps Landelijke Politiediensten ... In Spain, more than 90% of women in prostitution were victims of human trafficking. ... In Bulgaria, RiskMonitor Foundation estimated that more than 95% of those in prostitution have pimps linked to organized crime. ... In Germany SOLWODI estimated that 80% of women in prostitution are placed “under strong pressure and have no alternatives. This pressure may come from a partner or even their family, who send them abroad to work and send money back.” ... In Germany, policy analyst Barbara Yondorf estimated that 80–95% of women in prostitution have pimps. ... In San Francisco, 80% of women in prostitution interviewed by Marilyn Neckes and Theresa Lynch had pimps. ... In Oregon, 84% of women who had escaped prostitution had previously been controlled by pimps. ... In Ireland, Ruhama estimated that 80% of women in prostitution were under third-party control. ... In the United States, a study of women prostituted in hotels estimated that more than 80% were controlled by pimps. ... Ninety-five to 99% of women in German prostitution were under the control of others.  ""Childhood abuse is such a common precursor to prostitution that it is nearly universal among those in prostitution."" More siding on a past history of abuse (sexual and otherwise). And: ""Seventy percent of the adult women in prostitution in one study stated that childhood sexual assault was responsible for their entry into prostitution.""  So far we have 16% who are independent (no pimp), at most 30% who were not abused as a child, and around 60% who weren't a child prostitute. Not sure where there are overlaps, but at MOST 16% of prostitutes follow your criteria of not being trafficked or coerced.    ""While theory about prostitution as a “choice” abounds, it is impossible to distinguish prostitution from trafficking in most cases."" Well, that doesn't help!  https://www.mentalhelp.net/blogs/why-do-women-become-prostitutes-and-why-do-men-go-to-them/  ""There are many reasons for women becoming sex workers and escorts. Some of these women have stated that they are attracted by the large sums of money they can earn while they are still young. Others see it as a way to pay for university education and further advancement.""  (Then the other end of the spectrum, about how women are coerced into it.)  ""Again, it’s important to avoid generalizing about how women get into prostitution. Studies show that large numbers of prostitutes were sexually abused during their childhood.  It is the fact of the sexual abuse, more than anything else, that seems to underlay how and why some of them become prostitutes. These are the people most likely to be addicted to drugs...""  ""Finally, there are women who see prostitution as their way out of poverty. While they may choose to sell themselves, it is economic necessity that drives them. These are people who are unable to get jobs and are sometimes the only bread winners in the family.""  Not sure if that last one counts as I didn't see any linked studies. But anyway, I'm having trouble finding more about that 16%. And this has gotten way long so I'll leave it there!"

AskSocialScience,35pkan,exubereft,8,Tue May 12 22:26:57 2015 UTC,"Related:  Ronald Weitzer, “Popular Claims vs. Evidence-Based Conclusions in Human Trafficking”: talk given at Queens University Belfast School of Law, 11th April 2013, as part of the one-day conference New Frontiers of the Dark Figure: Measuring Hidden Crimes   I think there are four major claims that are made frequently about human trafficking, and I want to evaluate each one of those claims, and suggest that some of them – maybe all of them – are based on fairly thin ice. The first is that the magnitude of trafficking is huge – some people use the term “epidemic”. The second is that the problem is growing, there are increasing cases of victims over time. Third, that it’s the second or third largest organised crime enterprise in the world, after drug trafficking and arms trafficking. And fourth, that sex trafficking is much more prevalent than other types of trafficking – labour trafficking, agricultural, industrial and so on. So those are the four, I think, core claims that have been made frequently, both in research and by activists and government officials.  Are these claims evidence-based? Well, I would argue that they may be true. Each one of those four. But, so far, I’ve seen no compelling evidence to support any of the four claims. And one could even question whether those claims can be substantiated at the macro level – and when I say macro I mean at the national level or internationally. There was a study done by Sheldon Zhang at San Diego State University, who examined over a hundred academic articles based on trafficking, and found that very few of them used any original data, and most of them treated the claims of government organisations and NGOs as evidence. Very little in the way of empirical data collection to address these claims."

AskSocialScience,35nbqb,davidcarpenter122333,57,Mon May 11 22:27:11 2015 UTC,"The most common explanation in the biology community has to do with parental investment. Robert Trivers is the name most commonly attached to these ideas. (See Trivers, R. L. (1972) Parental investment and sexual selection. In B. Campbell (Ed.) Sexual selection and the descent of man, 1871-1971 (pp 136–179). Chicago, Aldine.)  The idea is based on the observation that human children have a relatively long period of development between birth and self-sufficiency, at least 10 years. During much of that time, children are relatively helpless and parents must care for them.  Biologically, high parental investment equates to a potentially high cost to cheating. Males become concerned with female cheating, because of the threat of raising a child that is not ones own (i.e. being cuckolded). Females become concerned with male cheating because the father of her children may get distracted by having offspring with another woman (i.e. his parental investment gets shared with another woman's children).  And so, the idea goes, if a human imposes a social stigma on his or her partner when it comes to cheating, all other things being equal that person will maintain an advantage when it comes to securing parental investment for their young. This pressure acting over time results in this anti-cheating stigma thriving in the general population.  The fact that birth control technologies now separate sex from reproduction, has not yet had time to affect our evolved mental tendencies."

Deep understanding generally doesn't come from excluding a line of thought or enforcing a false dichotomy.  The way we carve up human knowledge (""physics"", ""chemistry"", ""sociology"", ...), and the way we specialize and teach that knowledge to students, enforces this idea that one kind of framework is better than another. It's the in-group and out-group dynamic. I think it's best when we can come at problems from different angles."

The evopsych approach here seems to have the usual flaw: it takes a form of social arrangement--in this case, monogamous long term pair bonding with joint child raising, which coincidentally is the normative arrangement in the researcher's society--and assumes it is natural. Having taken that premise, it then seeks biological justification and constructs a set of evolutionary explanations. But if that assumption is shown to be unwarranted, and I would argue that an anthropological approach makes a pretty strong argument that it is, then the fundamentals are rather compromised.  Or to put it in other terms, when discussing human social arrangements we should have a pretty firm grasp of those arrangements before talking about birds."

AskSocialScience,35nbqb,marsten,3,Wed May 13 00:08:16 2015 UTC,"The explanation above doesn't propose to explain all aspects of your question. But it may explain why ""sexual jealousy"" is a concept that exists for a fairly broad cross-section of people and cultures.  Relating back to your point about bonobos, one way they are different from humans is in terms of male parental investment. Unlike humans where fathers invest heavily in offspring, bonobos have essentially zero parental investment from the father. The biologist would say it's not an accident we see greater sexual promiscuity in that species.  We can certainly point to a lot of variation among people and cultures about how these base tendencies are expressed. Why is premarital sex the norm in Sweden but a capital offense in parts of Afghanistan? These variations don't invalidate every conclusion from biology; they just mean that biology and culture and psychology layer together in a nontrivial way.  Ask a sociologist to name a human group without sexual jealousy, and the Mosuo in China will usually come up. Part of their culture is that men are relatively uninvolved in raising their own children, but instead invest their time raising nieces and nephews. This is again consistent with Trivers' explanation: Reduce male parental investment to zero and sexual jealousy goes away.  A culture might reduce the importance of male parental investment in other ways. One could speculate that countries with good support for mothers, and good job opportunities for women overall, could be more sexually open. One way to parse the growing sexual openness in the West during the 1960s is to relate it to growing opportunities for women. Alternatively cultures with relatively few opportunities for women (rural Afghanistan) are some of the least sexually progressive."

You're right that biology isn't irrelevant to this question, I just think there are better ways of answering this question.   But wait, I only gave an example of a society where fathers don't parent their children, I have no idea if they have as much sexual jealousy as others do.  In your example, with the Mosuo, do you know of what the mechanism is that caused their views to actually change? I doubt they think of their relationships from an evolutionary point of view. I doubt they'll thinking ""Oh, damn, my girlfriend cheated on my, I would be mad, except from an evolutionary point of view, I have nothing to gain and everything to loose by doing so. I'm not spending any resources on this child, so what do I have to gain?""  Is there a subconscious side of us thinking from that point of view? Is there some sort of underlying instinct?

If, for example, 90% of your specimens were dead after being exposed to chemical X, then you can determine that it is toxic to the species in question.    Sexology, on the other hand, is based on non-quantifiables.

A good place to start if you want more thorough answers though is the History of Sexology Sourcebook.  It provides a wonderfully indexed set up for most of the questions one may have for how things were or came to be, and pointers for further reading.  One bit at a time, Jealousy is a natural feeling, and Western culture tends to encourage it, but the why is the same why as virginity, so I'll get both of them at once.  Now, virginity, this goes back to the idea of women as property, which goes back all the way to the dawn of agriculture, prehistory.  To have a woman was to have the power to reproduce, so having a woman was the most important thing a man could have.  Now, due to lack of medical advances, women could die during childbirth, and even if they and the child survived, then there was no guarantee that the baby was the son of any given person unless they were the only man who had ever had sex with her.  Virginity until marriage was pretty much just one step away then.  Virginity also comes into several religions (virgin mary from christianity for example).  Keep in mind that many people thought that the baby came from men (nevermind the egg), so a virgin birth was all the more miraculous, and any baby born from a virgin was therefore the product of some sort of divine thing.  Add in a few thousand years of religion and culture movement, and virginity is this whole thing people worry about and loyalty to ones spouse is part of being any sort of 'decent human being'.    So, that jealousy thing?  I am of the opinion that it's mostly cultural, but it is a Heavily Debated Topic.  Of course some people do think that the whole one partner thing is BS, and so we have people who are swingers, polyamorous, in open relationships, monogamous, or relationship anarchists.  Pretty much the only thing they all agree on is informed consent  All this leads to the whole premarital or interracial sex things, which have completely different answers IMO.  Premarital sex goes back to the same virginity / jealousy / women as property thing I just rambled on about.  Interracial sex is a whole slew of things, from jingoism and lack of willingness to mix cultures, to racism and thinking of people as inferior and therefore taboo, to fear of spreading diseases, because different races have different frequencies of diseases as well as different immunities.    Which, thinking of diseases, we've understood a decent amount of how disease spreads for quite a long time, which is why even as far back as Rome they had bathhouses and methods for disposing of sewage, and why we have a natural aversion to things that look 'diseased' to us.  Still, this part is the one I'm most fuzzy on as my medical history is not as good.  Anywho, I hope this answers your question, please feel free to ask for clarification!"

In most countries the biggest city is bigger than the second biggest by double and so on and so forth.  Essentially bigger cities are preferred because they are more productive, and since they are more productive they can offer larger salaries so they grow. However either due to bad supply of housing and other goods, or too much demand, or both,  living standards become more expensive as well. Thus therest reaches a point where this largest city is no longer worth living there, so people allocate into the second largest city and so on. Obviously this is a very simplistic explanation but it gives you the general gist."

More to the point Bangkok is probably an extreme example but I would have thought it was actually quite normal for the largest city in a country to be substantially larger than the second largest (more than the double of Zipf's Law) and this holds true for A LOT of countries, in fact most countries I can think of the largest city is much bigger than the next one. Can you even name the second largest city in Thailand? Cambodia? Argentina?   In fact I would have thought it was more the rule than the exception, so it is a bit strange why OP is asking why some countries have such a concentration in the largest city, the question would seem more to be why do some countries NOT have such a concentration.  And if you look at the answer to that, the most obvious examples where there are multiple very large cities (China, India, United States) are also the countries that are large countries with the largest populations in the world, so it would probably make sense to break them down into smaller units. Where you will probably often find the same primate city phenomenon (New York and LA in their respective parts of the US, Mumbai in Maharashtra, Kolkata in West Bengal and so on). If you look at Indian states individually, they mostly do have this pattern, and these states would be more representative of a typical country size (in fact some of them would still be among the largest countries in the world on their own)."

The first one ignores the importance of the elite in a revolution, that exploits lower class discontent : for example, the french bourgeoisie taking advantage of unrest to overthrow the aristocracy (this is mostly touched upon in the Communist Manifesto I think). The second is false, well, because Revolutions are never a sure thing to happen, and there are still a lot of exploitative class systems around (we could take the Hindu Caste system that is still in use today, you could see it as quite exploitative). The third one is also false, otherwise no European country would have evolved into a modern democracy.

AskSocialScience,35i73a,KaliYugaz,5,Sun May 10 16:55:56 2015 UTC,"Various ""schools"" of feminism are useful categories largely because they help us identify common commitments, common arguments, and so on that run throughout members of the schools. The schools are not all-encompassing, such that any given feminist idea can be attributed to one or more of the schools, and there is no reason that one cannot hold views from multiple schools. There is considerable disagreement between people who belong to the various schools, both about topics that the school in general is taken to be more or less agreed on, except for some edge cases, and especially on topics that the school doesn't have much to say about.  The only way a person would have all and only feminist views that fit into one school is if some spectacular coincidence has occurred, such that one has come to have only views that one school endorses and also hasn't thought about issues and come up with opinions on things that this school hasn't addressed in much detail.  So, for instance, someone who identifies as a liberal feminist may disagree with other liberal feminists about various things, because liberal feminism isn't one settled set of views and because liberal feminism is not all-encompassing and thus leaves open a lot of questions that you could have any opinion about and still be a liberal feminist.  There are probably some sets of beliefs that are so important to one or another school of feminism that if one doesn't hold them it wouldn't make sense to identify with the school, although one might have other opinions that are in agreement with some of the things that the school in question says.  In general there is really no reason to worry about how a set of views or how your views fits into a school or multiple schools. Schools are used to identity lines of argumentation and paradigmatic views - you can ask for any given view whether it fits into a school, and you can ask if some of the reasons you have for believing a certain view match the reasons that one or another school believes in certain views, but it's very unlikely that a comprehensive feminist worldview is going to be easily summed up by a school.  In your case nothing you say really conflicts with much of anything to the degree that this set of views would obviously not belong to a school or obviously belong to a school. I can't really see where /u/aq12wsxcd came up with the idea that radical feminism is the school that fits this set of views best. If anything, it sounds more like Marxist feminism. But, again, ""which school is this"" is not a really good question to ask in the first place."

I don't think this is the best way to summarize Marxist feminist commitments about the source of oppression.   But the OP seems to be suggesting that the roots of oppression are biological, and these differences between sexes are the fundamental causes of oppression.    Surely not - OP says that oppression stems from different interests. We can obviously differ biologically without having different interests.   This sounds like radicalism to me.

AskSocialScience,35i73a,TychoCelchuuu,2,Sun May 10 18:24:22 2015 UTC,"But the source of oppression is surely a ""common argument"" that shows up in the literature within the ""schools"". It may not be a comprehensive way to index schools, but it is certainly useful, no?   Only if you think that within each school there is a unity of views on the source of oppression, that between each school there are differences in views on the source of oppression, and that all (or at least most) of the schools commit themselves to providing an answer to the question of the source of oppression. I'm not sure I think any or all of those three things.   Are you saying that Marxists don't use dialectical materialism as the starting point for all analysis? This is what defines Marxism.   ehhhhhhh   This is tautological in your view though. The divisions are meaningless, so no argument can have elements that strike you as being like any particular kind of feminism.   I never said that the elements of an argument can strike me as being like any particular kind of feminism. You are putting (false) words into my mouth. I never even said that a set of views can't strike me as being like any particular kind of feminism. I just said that it's very unlikely that any given set of views is likely to be helpfully categorized as belonging to one or another branch of feminism, because there is overlap, because the various branches of feminism are not all-encompassing, and because it's just very unlikely, as you start to add views together, that all of them cleanly fit into one school rather than another, just like it's very unlikely, as you start gathering people in a room together, that all of them have birthdays in March.  It's certainly possible and obviously it's not just possible but probable (and actual) that some individual people are born in March, but once you start grouping people together, ""the month you were born in that starts with an M"" starts to be a very unhelpful categorization method, because not all people fit into one month that starts with M (some were born in May, for instance) and some people don't even have birthdays in a month that starts with M at all!"

This also gives both outsiders and insiders somewhat rigid guidelines on what to expect when dealing with someone who self-identifies as 'communist'. A follow-up question could then help define the more exact nature of the persons opinions by asking, continuing with our communist examples, if they are stalinists, trotskyist, anarcho-communists, or whatever. In that sense I perceive communism to have a less ""ideologically mixed"" composition than how you portray feminism.   This first raises the question on whether communism is an apt example (since it might be that it actually is just as loose and I am misunderstanding it). Secondly it returns us to the original question I was trying to ask.

AskSocialScience,35glxj,Justdowhatever93,42,Sun May 10 03:54:16 2015 UTC,"While they won't be demanding rights themselves, I would wager that the next big shift will involve animal rights.  I'll briefly note some of the philosophical, legal, and psychological trends that lead me to this inference.  I'm going to make some sweeping oversimplifications, so nitpickers get your picks ready.  :)  Philosophically, the idea that animals have rights has been gaining ground since the 1800s.  Prior to that, the Mechanistic philosophy of  Hobbes and Descartes was the common (Western) perception.  Animals, lacking souls and/or minds, were simply automata --  they couldn't really feel the way we could.  (This argument was used in support of slavery in the United States for centuries to come.)  Rousseau (in the Introduction to Discourse on Inequality), while noting that animals couldn't participate in the social contract (which was in vogue at the time), did believe that due to a shared ""nature"" animals should not be ""wantonly ill−treated"" by people.  Bentham, on the other hand, argued that animals could suffer, and therefore we shouldn't treat them poorly.  The French were giving limited rights to slaves at the time, and Bentham argued that animals should be next on the list.  By the time we get to Schopenhauer in the mid 1800s, he's straight arguing that animals have rights in On the Basis of Morality.  (Though he blames the Jews for corrupting Western thought on the the matter, so go figure.)  At about the same time, legal developments have started occurring.  Much like slaves were being granted limited rights, England's ""Martin's Act"" of 1822 gave horses... something like rights.  You couldn't just beat them for fun any more.  Similar anti-cruelity laws were passed in the Americas and throughout Europe.  (Note these followed on the heels of slave codes.)  This is a huge shift when you think about it.  Animals went from simply being property to being something... more.  Something with rights that the state would protect.  In the 20th century these trends continued with the establishment of quazi-governmental animal protection groups and anti-vivisection groups.  Lately, we've had a rash of suits in the West attempting to claim legal personhood for animals for a variety of reasons.  (Very similar to the fetal personhood initiatives, actually.)    But most importantly, our attitudes towards animals have changed.  There's an old (1983!) but interesting study by Kellert that looked at the changes in news reports over the first three quarters of the 20th century.  Basically, we've gone from talking about animals as property to talking about animals as companions.    That's the thing -- we love animals now.  Many people consider their pets part of their families.  The lit review in Archer (1996) gives a good overview of the degree to which we love our pets like never before.  People think their animals will be waiting for them in heaven.  We've decided that they're a lot like us, they have feelings, they have intelligence, and they even have souls.  The parallels to traditional civil rights struggles are pretty apparent.  Ergo, my money's on the puppies and kittens.

However, I would like to note that US history is not exactly full of movement's issues being fully addressed and then petering out.  Women's rights and black rights are particularly good examples of this.  There are serious issues that are still left unaddressed e.g. health disparities, income disparities, education, criminal justice system.    After marriage equality there is obviously non-discrimination bills in things such as hiring, housing, and services.  However, health and educational disparities will also exist.  Getting GLBT friendly sex-ed is extremely important but given that we can't even get rid of abstinence only education, that would seem to be fight that will not be won for years to come. I think it is fair to say the gay rights movement will be around for a time to come.  Another thing to note is that the gay rights movement is not a novel movement, it has roots that stretch pretty far back.  Stonewall in 69 is kind of the start date in the public's eye but organization well predated that event.  Here is a nice article that deals with some of this from a legal perspective.

Something very similar happens when you get very deep into mixing, looping, layering, and mashing up this music as well.

First we'll go really broad then we'll work it down from there, mainly because I'm starting under the premise that Jung definitely didn't get much, and he definitely missed the boat on neuro.  So, is there work on symbolic metaphor? Definitely! You have tons of fields you could look into - a large portion of that field I would recommend under cultural psychology. Of course, this is much more theory-driven (and theory-kept). But I think there's good reason to start here. Individuals such as Charles Sanders Peirce and much more contemporary, Jaan Valsiner build their work around hierarchical and systemic models of how signs are created and negotiated over time.   One issue I'm having in directly answering your question is that, well, everything is a sign! I (and Valsiner & Peirce) would say all labels are signs in a way. So I would then direct you to Piaget's basic work on assimilation and accommodation to get into how a lot of developmental psychologists think of signs.   As far as neuro psych, less my area, but I think again it starts from a hard description of what is a sign and how does one study it in the brain. You would find more articles on, say, how a religious brain signal is different from a non-religious brain signal, or how some interpretations of judgment are due to being more emotional vs. rational (and maybe you could extend that to religion?). But neuro psych isn't so far (as I know it) about ""How does your brain light up when you see X vs. Y"" but more so ""How does your brain light up when you are doing task X vs Y""."

Don't go around expecting this means that, for example, marijuana is legal for people with religious beliefs that include them. It's still not. Most drugs are still illegal under this framework because the government has a ""compelling government interest"" in their regulation for public safety and health. That's why the case from 1990, Employment Division v. Smith, was able to rule peyote illegal despite its ritual use. The majority opinion there, penned by Justice Scalia, said that while states could remove the restriction on peyote, the religious freedom clause of the First Amendment does not force them to remove restrictions on it. Scalia wrote:   We have never held that an individual's religious beliefs excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the State is free to regulate.   Which about sums it up. With a compelling government interest at play, one can stop the exemption. Scalia added, though, that bans which incidentally affect religious practice are not the same as bans targeting religious practice, placing a higher bar for appeals in the future to prove that the ban targets religious practice in particular."

For papers with a strong quantitative/empirical component, journals often require that authors post their data and computer code. Looking at the most recent two issues of the American Economic Review (January and April, 2015), of the 18 papers with posted data/code, they broke down as follows:*   14 papers had a Stata component 6 papers had a Matlab component 1 paper had an SAS component 1 paper had an R component 1 paper had an Eviews component   Further, as far as I can tell, Stata was used primarily for non-structural empirical analysis, while Matlab was used for structural empirical analysis and simulation. This is a small sample size and only from one journal (albeit a good one), but I expect you'd continue to see this pattern if you took a larger sample and included other (general purpose) journals.    * Notes: (1) These numbers add up to more than 18 because some papers used a combination of different programs.

And it's mainly popular among bloggers, not economists.  If you'd like some reasons...  There are multiple object classes meant for the same thing (xts, zoo, ts). Some functions work with some object types, but not others. Much coding effort is spent coercing objects between classes. Or some packages will randomly stop working with some object classes. This will break your previously written code.  For time series, notice that every single one of the published textbooks on this topic all use different packages. This means each author saw the other packages and felt they weren't good enough to use so they made their own. Of course these authors have also documented problems with R and time series.  Some packages will change the behavior of base R functions with no warning (e.g., the xts package and the lag function). This will break your previously written code and produce wrong results with no warning.  Some packages are not updated and will not work with newer versions of R. I have had to literally downgrade my version of R to continue using the package I wanted.  There are still bugs in basic functions, and the documentation is routinely poor across the board.  You have to manually subset your data if you want to do an estimation over different time periods. R can't plot time series variables that start in different periods. Ok, it will, but it will pull data from different time periods and plot those as scatter points, which is embarrassingly wrong.   Your residuals and fitted values after any regression are not time series objects. When you take a lag of a variable you can't even use it because its automatic naming convention is not valid. You can't use time series operators in your regression formulas. Arima estimation doesn't return p-values. Some graphing functions will work with time series objects, others won't.

AskSocialScience,357smc,oxensneeze,7,Thu May 7 20:38:11 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting and amusing question.  To give an answer, I would compare the rate of violent victimization according to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) with the imprisonment rate of drug offenders according to the National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) program. I choose to use survey data as it can be a more reliable measure of crime compared to police data (problems such as the dark figure of crime, the disparity between reporting to the police and recording by the police, ...).  2013 US Population Estimate   According to the United States Census Bureau, the population estimate for 2013 was 316,128,839.   2013 Violent victimization rates  According to the NCVS, the rate of violent crime in 2013 was 23.2 per 1000.  2012/2013 Number of drug offenders sentenced to prison   Regarding state jurisdiction, ""[d]rug offenders comprised 16% (210.200 inmates) of the total state prison population in 2012"". Their latest data for state prisons is of December 31, 2012. Regarding federal jurisdiction, ""on September 30, 2013, 98,200 inmates [...] were imprisoned for possession, trafficking, or other drug crimes"".   Let's calculate the incarceration rate so we can make comparisons...  (210.200 + 98.200 =) 308.400/316.128.839 x 1000 = 0.98 (per 1000).  Result   If in 2013 each violent victimization was perpetrated by a single person and each perpetrator was sentenced to prison and at the same time all drug offenders were released from prison, the violent offenders would occupy 23 as many cells. For serious violent crime (defined as ""rape or sexual assault, robbery and aggravated assault"" by the NCVS) it'd be 7 times as much.   In any case, if we tried to replace all drug offenders with all violent offenders (whether discovered or not) prison population would grow.  I'll be taking a step further here and look at the median time served for serious violent offences and for drug offences:  Federal length of imprisonment   According to the 2012 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics, concerning prison lengths, the median time served by drug offenders is 51 months. The median time served for sexual abuse, assault and robbery respectively is 120 months, 30 months, 63 months.   State length of imprisonment  According to the NPS, concerning the ""median time served by released state prison inmates admitted on new court commitments"" in 2012...   ...drug offenders served 13 months. ... for rape/sexual assault, robbery and aggravated or simple assault respectively inmates served 48 months, 34 months, 17 months.   In general, violent offenders who are sentenced to prison seem to stay in prison for a longer time (there could be an exception for assault). It would thus seem that in our fictitious scenario in which all violent offenders are discovered and sentenced to prison while all drug offenders are liberated, the US would need more cells, which would remain occupied for a longer period of time.  Comments  But this is a crude comparison, because there are many factors to consider, as you have already noted: the number of perpetrators could be greater than the number of victims, a same perpetrator can be responsible for several victimization (a minority of criminals is responsible for the majority of crime), offenders can be guilty of more than one kind of offence, not all violent offenders are sentenced to prison (which is why I also took into consideration the NCVS rates for serious violent crime - but to nuance all these numbers, I'll add that according to the Bureau of Prisons there's an overwhelming over-representation of drug offenders in prison. It would seem that the likelihood of an offender being sentenced to prison for drug offences is much higher than other offences), et cetera."
AskSocialScience,357smc,Kraftz,4,Fri May 8 02:51:05 2015 UTC,"The rate of crimes being solved is the clearance rate you can get the numbers from the FBI here.    The Federal Bureau of Prisons has incarceration rate by offense here  So if we look at the stats then the amount of drug offenders are:  237,000 + 95,474 = 332,474  (using the data below as well as state)   Although in this data I don't know if violence was part of the offense and dropped in a plea deal or just that the offense was non-violent nor can you see the history.  But if we accept that number as true then we see the difference.  So if we take violent-crime alone from the FBI data the number nationally is 1,060,028 and the clearance rate is 46.8%.  Which gives us 496,093 so that is the number cleared and 563,935 is un-cleared.    So just with violent crime the numbers are higher in favor of un-cleared crimes.  Also I am not sure that agencies have to report 100%, or at least not all reporting is the same, but I could be incorrect on that, and I have to step out for family dinner.

AskSocialScience,352iya,totooto,15,Wed May 6 16:40:58 2015 UTC,"A few good background readings are this by Woodford and this by Kocherlakota.  Some things that, I think, are pretty well attested:   In the long run, economic growth comes through increased labor productivity and technological change, not through the accumulation of factors of production. See Easterly and Levine, ""It's Not Factor Accumulation,"" 2000. The basic Solow growth model can, nevertheless, form the useful core of a theory of growth. See Mankiw, Romer, and Weil, ""A Contribution to the Empirics of Economic Growth,"" 1992. In the long run, the price level is directly proportional to the level of the money stock. The inflation rate is proportional to the growth rate of the money stock. See Lucas, ""Monetary Neutrality,"" 1995. (This is the quantity theory of money.) In the long run, the level of output is independent of the money stock. The growth rate of output is independent of the growth rate of the money stock. See Lucas, ""Monetary Neutrality,"" 1995. (This is the neutrality of money.) Inflation is a monetary phenomenon (see 3), so monetary policy may be usefully tasked with the responsibility of keeping inflation stable. In the short run, monetary policy can affect both output growth and inflation. This is the Phillips Curve relationship. See Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans, ""Monetary Policy Shocks,"" 1999. Monetary policy takes some time to affect broader macroeconomic aggregates. Hence the central bank should not target current inflation, but inflation over some medium-term horizon, typically 2-5 years. See Svensson, ""Inflation Forecast Targeting,"" 1997. Stabilization policy can usefully mitigate business-cycle fluctuations. See Friedman, ""The Role of Monetary Policy, 1968. See Eichenbaum, ""Some Thoughts on Practical Stabilization Policy,"" 1998. See Svensson, ""What have we learned in the past 50 years,"" 2008. Monetary and fiscal policymaking should be analyzed as ""rules,"" not as year-by-year decisions about the interest rate or deficit. Policy should be systematic, predictable, and lean against macroeconomic fluctuations. See Kydland and Prescott, ""Rules rather than Discretion,"" 1977.  Macroeconomic policy is affected by the way the private sector perceives policy. Statistical correlations can break down as soon as policymakers try to exploit them. See Lucas, ""Expectations and the Neutrality of Money,"" 1972. See Lucas, ""Econometric Policy Evaluation: A Critique,"" 1976. If monetary policy is stabilizing the business cycle, there is little role for countercyclical fiscal policy. See Auerbach, ""Is there a role for discretionary fiscal policy,"" ‎2002. See Taylor, ""Reassessing Discretionary Fiscal Policy,"" 2000. Fiscal policy should focus on public finance issues: public goods provision, social insurance provision, reasonable taxation, and reasonable regulation practices. Leave countercyclical policy to the central bank. Monetary expansion is expansionary; fiscal contraction is contractionary. See here. In the long run, exchange rates reflect puchasing power parity. In the short run, we have no idea what drives exchange rate fluctuations. See Rogoff, ""The PPP Puzzle,"" JEL 1996.   Maybe some of those are uninteresting to you, but they are a start. I'll add more if you want."

AskSocialScience,354wji,yuumai,6,Thu May 7 03:15:56 2015 UTC,"I'll begin by being rather blunt: I have a hard time accepting that your mother - as a sociologist - would say anything that simplistic in relation to any discussion of gender and the family. Are you quite sure that the claim you're making here is the best possible interpretation of what your mother was saying, in the context of whatever discussion you were having?  Moving on, I will try to address a your query in a couple of different ways, one through the lens of a feminist analysis of fathers and the family, and the other from a somewhat more empirical position, keeping in mind that what follows is a pretty crude overview of a far more nuanced academic field of inquiry. Buckle up, because this might take a while...  A feminist analysis of fatherhood - particularly one that incorporates any sort of theorizing around the concept of ""hegemonic masculinity"" (Wikipedia version here) may include the claim that, due to the nature of how men understood their roles in both society and the family, the responsibility of early childhood care and socialization often rested squarely with the mother. Put more simply: back in the day, men were expected to spend most of their time out of the home earning for the family, while women were expected to remain in the home, where they would care for the needs - material, social, and spiritual - of the family's children. Fathers were expected to serve largely as distant, emotionally unavailable role-models for their children; they were what their sons ""should"" become, and the kind of men their daughters ""should"" grow up to marry. Fathers were also - ideally - supposed to be the final arbiters of judgment and discipline in the family (""just you wait until your father gets home...""), a position that often included judicious use of corporal punishment, which has been shown to be largely ineffective. In this context then, fathers - as a specific category of parent - appear to be largely superfluous, if we accept the premise that in ""traditional"" family structures, the overwhelming majority of childcare work rests with the mother. While it is certainly true that many individual fathers were almost certainly more active in the lives of their children, the expectations of fathers-as-a-social-category amounted to little more than ""be there"". Changing diapers was women's work, as was feeding, bathing, teaching, nurturing, comforting, and supporting children; fathers were expected to protect the virtue of their daughters and train their sons to be just like them.   These rigidly defined roles weren't hidden or subtly reinforced either (at least, they weren't only subtly reinforced), they were also on blatant display in the popular culture; just watch any three episodes of ""leave it to beaver"" or ""the Waltons"" or really any television show or movie from the 1940s-1970s and you'll see those values on display.   TL;DR: In a society where men are not expected to shoulder an equal burden when it comes to raising children, it is reasonable to assume that the parent who is largely responsible has a greater impact on a child's development.  This has begun to change - and dramatically - in the past two decades or so. More and more fathers are taking an active, personal interest in the lives of their children, even if they have yet to take on their full share of domestic labour. Contemporary fathers continue to work more outside of the home than their partners do, while women generally spend around twice as much time as their male partners on domestic labour and childcare. What this data shows is that while traditional patterns of gendered behaviour (""gender roles"" if you want) are eroding, the core architecture remains. This presents a continued barrier to both men and women in families; men's out-of-home work demands limit the time they can spend with their children, while women's continued in-home labour (which is unpaid and therefore problematic for a whole slew of reasons that I won't get into) limits the amount of time they are able to spend in the paid-labour force. This rapid and dramatic shift in parenting styles has prompted the emergence of a whole new subgenre of the sociological investigation into families, called ""fatherhood studies"", which seeks to examine empirically the impacts of this new form of fatherhood on families. This is a good thing, because as it stands right now, we (sociologists) don't actually know for certain what these impacts look like.   We do know that family stability is a far more important predictor of scholastic and social success for children than almost any other indicator beyond the usual ones (parents' education, income, geographic location, etc.) Put another way: it doesn't really matter if the family is mom-and-dad, mom-and-mom, dad-and-dad, or some other queering of traditional family structure, what matters is that the family remains healthy and stable throughout a child's development.  Finally, a quick note: as any sociologist of the family reading this will no doubt see, this is not my field of research. I've given a rough sketch at the ""sociology 101"" level, but what I've written may be out of date or inaccurate. If anyone else could fill in the gaps, or correct what I've written, I'd appreciate it.  Also, sorry about the paywalled articles. They're better than what you'll find elsewhere, and the abstracts should be enough to get you started. If you're interested in knowing more, head to your local library or college/university library where you should be able to access at least a few of the articles provided."
AskSocialScience,354wji,Mauve_Cubedweller,1 point,Thu May 7 05:13:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the thorough response!    To address your first point I will give you a little context (or perhaps a lot of context) for the conversation. My parents are former hippies and parented with many of the standard ""hippie"" values such as no corporal punishment, equal child-rearing responsibilities, breastfeeding is best, and a philosophy of ""the main goal of a parent is to teach a child that s/he is loved.""  My parents shared all child-rearing tasks roughly equally. Diaper changes, feeding (obviously my dad couldn't breast-feed, but my mom often used a pump), etc. Around the time of my birth and into my toddler years they both enrolled in school and by the time I was in my teenage years they had both obtained doctorates. During this time we went from quite poor to somewhere in the mid-to-upper middle class. By my early twenties they had divorced.   I have two brothers, and recently my older brother has been having a tough time (Bad financial and relationship decisions, drug and alcohol abuse). The conversation of the other night was on this topic. I am reasonably confident that I understood the claims on parenting that she made, especially since I took pains to ask for clarification and expressed skepticism. However, it is possible that I misunderstood. It is also possible that my mother did not say exactly what she meant as she had a couple glasses of wine and was fairly upset about the situation with my brother.   The comments that she made were specifically in the context of (and I am paraphrasing), my son is a failure and perhaps this means that all of my parenting choices were wrong. My response was that she was not a failure as a mother, my brother was not a failure, despite his current difficulties, and that my father equally shared the blame for any perceived parenting mistakes. Her response was that the current literature on the effects of parenting clearly shows that nearly all outcomes hinge on the behavior of the mother; that fathers had a beneficial effect on child development if they were present, but they have virtually no further effect even if they are quite hands-on and share the parenting load. She then challenged me to look into myself.   TLDR: yes, I am fairly confident that I understood what she was saying, but there is always the possibility that I misunderstood or she misspoke.   So, all that being said, I thought I would ask some experts and hopefully find some help in identifying scholarly sources on the topic. What I think you are saying is that there aren't many papers on this issue, but I think I will take your advice and head to the library for some research.   Still, it seems to me that the claim my mother made, if understood correctly is inherently flawed and even sexist. It couldn't possibly (in my mind) be true that women just have more of an effect on a child than a man does after providing the same level of care. After all, single fathers and gay couples are able to raise well-adjusted, successful children all the time."
AskSocialScience,354wji,Mauve_Cubedweller,2,Thu May 7 19:09:43 2015 UTC,"Based on the work that I do (I study men and masculinities), I'd say that your mother is off-base - at least in terms of parenting over the last decade or so. What I mean by that is that historically, there was certainly a benefit to having a father-figure around during a child's development, but that presence was ancillary to the impact of a family's primary agent of socialization: the mother. It's unfair, but them's the facts: historically men were generally peripheral figures in the rearing of children. When they were there, men were often expected to take on the role of the stern, disciplinarian and head of the household. ""Nurturing"" just wasn't a part of traditional notions of ""fatherhood"".   There's nothing biological or intrinsic about this; we're talking about gender roles and expectations, not biology here. Fathers simply were not as important when it came to child-rearing as mothers were, because no one really expected fathers to do anything in particular when it came to raising kids. Women were the ones who were supposed to take care of all of the child's primary needs; hell, fathers weren't even expected to show up to things like parent-teacher meetings or ""family days"" at schools back in the day (so pre-1980s I'm talking about here).   Generation X (and Gen-Y - whatever the hell that is) is really the first generation that I can think of where fathers were expected to take a more active role in their childrens' lives, but the literature generally indicates that the role fathers took for themselves was that of the ""fun parent"". Moms were still the primary caregivers, but in addition to their traditional responsibilities, mothers were suddenly thrust into the role of disciplinarian - the role historically occupied by fathers. Dads increasingly took on all of the ""fun"" parenting duties for themselves - taking the kids on trips or sports outings, etc. In other words, ""active"" dads were often only really serving as ""substitute parents"" - standing in for mom when she was tired/sick/unavoidably absent. Of course, there were many fathers who were primary caregivers - stay at home dads, single parent households, widowers, etc. - but they were - and are - in the distinct minority.    It couldn't possibly (in my mind) be true that women just have more of an effect on a child than a man does after providing the same level of care. After all, single fathers and gay couples are able to raise well-adjusted, successful children all the time.    I'm sorry, but historically speaking, your mother is right. Mothers did and to a certain extent still do have much more impact on their children's upbringing than fathers do. This isn't about men and women either: we're talking about social roles here - mothers and fathers - and the expectations we place on each. Historically, the mothering role was almost always ascribed to women, because women were almost always expected to stay at home with the kids. Father's roles emphasized the importance of staying out of the home to earn income.  Today, the difference between ""mothers"" and ""women"" is starkly visible; we have an increasing number of stay at home dads and same sex couples who are raising children and while in these relationships, there is almost always a primary caregiver, we don't call them 'mothers' anymore. We call them 'primary caregivers' because we recognize that the historical coupling of ""mother"" (as a social role that involved nurturing, caring, supporting, and teaching young children) and ""woman"" is no longer satisfactory. This last bit might seem pretty arcane, but trust me, it's important, theoretically speaking.  Today's fathers are taking on more responsibility for their children's development, but it remains far from equal. Your family was anomalous - and outlier if you want - in the overall tapestry of parenting in Western societies. Men, while doing more, are still expected to do less, because Western cultures still generally hew to the idea that ""Man = public sphere/income earner: Woman = private sphere/homemaker"". Reality is always far more complicated, but many of our notions of how mothers and fathers ought to behave and what roles they ought to fill remain kind of simplistic.   And we don't have a lot of data on gay families because - as I'm sure you know - gay marriage is a recent phenomenon in Western nations... hell, in America, it's still a hard-fought, state-by-state thing and doesn't even begin to cover issues like same-sex adoption, surrogacy, or foster parenting... it's a mess, which is why we need folks like you to dig into it and help sort it all out!"
AskSocialScience,354kwg,Heart-Of-Darkness,3,Thu May 7 01:32:08 2015 UTC,"Time for Neil Postman!!!!! In Amusing Ourselves to Death, Postman tells the story of a television program (edit: aired in 1983 right after a very polemical movie about a nuclear holocaust) about the possibilities and dangers of a nuclear holocaust. This program was billed as a ""discussion, not a debate"", and it featured Ted Koppel as the MC, with the guests being Henry Kissinger, Robert McNamara, Elie Wiesel, Carl Sagan, William Buckley and General Brent Scowcroft.  The show ran for ninety minutes, had no theme music (which made it ""ominous"", to Postman) and was television at its most serious. If television can be used as a medium for proper transmission of information (which is what you're asking about, to me), then this program is as proper and informative as they come.  It was a shitshow in terms of serious discussion: each guest had five minutes to talk and they each talked about whatever they wanted. They could not agree on exactly what the subject was; Kissinger ""seemed intent on making viewers feel sorry that he was no longer their Secretary of State by reminding everyone of books he had once written, proposals he had once made, and negotiations he had once conducted""; McNamara ""informed the audience that he had eaten lunch in Germany that very afternoon, and went on to say that he had at least fifteen proposals to reduce nuclear arms"".  In other words, there was no real discussion, the program was a disaster, and it gave the viewer no useful information. Postman argues that this marks the ultimate failure of television as a serious medium.  In that spirit (and this is where I most directly address your question), I think you should actually ask yourself what the vocabulary of television news is used for, rather than what vocabulary is used. Walter Cronkite was raised during the Depression. When he grew up, the books he read and the people he looked up to had a much different vocabulary than, for example, Brian Williams' idols. Television was also a very new medium when Cronkite was around, so it stands to reason that they were still ""experimenting"", mostly by borrowing the language of radio and print.  The differences you may see in vocabulary between the coverage of Kennedy's assassination and that of Kim K's wedding are mostly due to these factors: the people you see covering Kennedy's death are much older than you and me, and the medium was very new. Today, the people are almost your contemporaries, and the medium is established - so people know exactly what language ""works"" on television and what kinds of things television is good and bad at."

Market socialism differs from non-market socialism by the existence of a market for allocating capital goods and the means of production.[1][2] Depending on the specific model of market socialism, profits generated by socially owned firms may variously be used to directly remunerate employees, accrue to society at large as the source of public finance, or be distributed amongst the population in a social dividend. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_socialism  State Capitalism: State capitalism is usually described as an economic system in which commercial (i.e. for-profit) economic activity is undertaken by the state, with management and organization of the means of production in a capitalist manner, including the system of capital accumulation, wage labor, and centralized management.[1] This designation applies to economies regardless of the political aims of the state, even if the state is nominally socialist.[2] State capitalism is characterized by the dominance of state-owned business enterprises in the economy. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism  It is probably important to note that the USSR, North Korea etc etc while claiming to be "" on the path to Socialism"" were in reality, actually State Capitalist and this was noted by Lenin himself.

That said there has been lots of academic level debate on this issues within the socialist 'camp' insofar as it is a big question for them, with various positions about what the USSR was, and when it became what it was (i.e. between Trotskyists who argued it degenerated and others that analyse the soviet system as one of at least continuity).  I can offers some links on the best debates concerning the USSR, most of these are from academics. The first port of call might be van der linden's Western Marxism and the Soviet Union (pdf.) which contains an overview of the theories and debates concerning the Soviet system since 1917. Perhaps have a look at some of Simon Clarke's publications (he's good in general on Marxist theory and sociology). Check out Aufheben journal's 4-part series on What was the USSR. Also check out the Libcom reading guide on the USSR and China, with lots of useful/helping links to books and articles. I would also suggest having a look at the Open Marxism journal insofar as they adopt a 'libertarian' Marxism and contain many of the most famous Marxist intellectuals (Negri, Bonefeld, Holloway). Also watching this talk with Zizek and Stephen Kotkin on Stalin and the USSR is highly interesting (if theory light) (Kotkin isn't a marxist but a respected soviet historian his discussion with zizek is therefore interesting). You also might want to check out Capitalism and class struggle in the USSR (pdf.) - Neil C. Fernandez  I've mainly referenced more 'libertarian' or left communist and left Marxist critiques of the USSR. But there's a mountain of debate from all sides concerning the USSR ongoing for nearly 100 years. If you like I can give you both anarchist critiques (though anarchists are rare in academia) for example look up work by Emma Goldman (she was there during the revolution) or Berkman. See From the Russian revolution of 1917 to Stalinist totalitarianism - Agustín Guillamón or Russian Revolution 1917 - further reading guide or The Bolsheviks and workers' control: the state and counter-revolution - Maurice Brinton. As for Trotskyists who were/are represented still within academia they hold a variety of opinions. Trotsky's view in the 1930s and taken up by many was the USSR as 'degenerated workers state'. This view was later argued against by the theorists organised around the Socialist Workers Party in the UK (centrally Tony Cliff). It was characterised by them as 'state capitalist' - this the original article, also this longer one. This theory was later extended by the likes of Chris Harman and Nigel Harris who utilised the works of Max Schachtman. It may also be worth looking at Ernst Mandel's Beyond Perestroika where he analyses Gorbachev's reforms, you can also search through the archive of his work for stuff on the Soviet system  I would also suggest looking at the New Left Review and Capital and Class journals. Together they published work from pretty much ever major left-wing academic in the western world, but with a focus on Britain. And they contain all the variety of debates from the 1960s to the presents on the numerous issues facing Marxism and socialist theory. It should also be mentioned that you can find more precise analysis and critiques of particular moments in Soviet history (i.e. Stalin's rise, Hungarian uprising 1956 and so on)."
AskSocialScience,34w6vm,Moontouch,11,Tue May 5 09:44:16 2015 UTC,"I'm an /r/askphilosophy panelist on Marxism, and I think this is a good question in that sense that there isn't a definitive answer. Most contemporary and revolutionary Marxian socialists tend not to concern themselves so much with a new practice of building socialism. The concern is instead on understanding the extreme limitations that previous socio-economic conditions brought in regions that experienced socialist revolutions (like Russia and China) which in turn created authoritarianism.  There are some notable exceptions to the rule. Marxian economist Richard Wolff in some of his lectures and/or works has talked about focusing more on the superstructure when building a socialist society and not merely the economic base. This critique argues that a fundamental error previous nominally socialist states made was that they focused entirely on attempting to build a new progressive socio-economic system but retained the bulk of their society's conservatism in the superstructure which includes things like culture, family, marriage, etc. A backward and conservative superstructure cannot uphold a socialist and progressive economic base. Che Guevara also made a similar argument in his work ""Socialism and Man in Cuba"" which I also summarized here."
AskSocialScience,34w6vm,yodatsracist,1 point,Tue May 5 08:01:30 2015 UTC,"Two rhings, quickly. /u/moontouch mentions Richard Wolf's focus on the superstructure. The superstructure in Marxist thinking relates to anything that is epiphenominal to the true economic base--generally here culture. Culture in most Marxist thinking can generally be traced back to Gramsci, an Italian communist leader and intellectual. His big explanation for why the workers hadn't risen up was ""hegemony"". That is, unlike classical Marxism, it's not just the base that matters for revolution but also the superstructure. In Italy, Gramsci argued, the conservative classes' cultural control over the workers (often called ""subaltern"" in his language--there's a debate whether that's a distinction he's making from proletarian, or just a code word to help sneak his writing out of prison), particularly the Catholic curch, that's preventing works from coming together and rising up. This is hugely influential for Eurocommunists and Leftist intellectuals (less influential within then once-existing communist bloc). For instance, Berkeley Sociologist Cihan Tugal just wrote a book a few years ago called The Passive Revolution, about how Islamist parties in the 80's and 90's were the most radically redistributive in Turkey's political space but by the 00's they were strongly ""neoliberal"", pro-business parties, that's all based on his update of Gramschi's hegemony.   Two, Revolutions are fairly rare. When they've succeeded ""gloriously"" (the French, the Russian, the Chinese), they've come under specific events. The most famous social scientist on Revolutions is Theda Skocpol. She argument says that for these ""social revolutions"", where old norms are destroyed and new revolutionary norms are adapted (every communist revolution assume this), you need to have among a few other things, a pre-revolutionary state with a ""crisis of state"" (usually such crippling debt that the organs of the state basically stop working) and a class ready to take advantage of that crisis. Those aren't common. There's another literature on agrarian (peasant) revolutionary politics (which wasn't part of the Marxist debate until Mao, but became perhaps the part of Marxism most likely to actually lead to revolution in the second half of the 20th ycentury), but I'm less familiar with it. Here's a ~20 page review of the various arguments about agrarian revolutions by Theda Skocpol herself.  Skocpol's basic understanding of revolutions is accepted (but critiqued and extended obviously) by most other academic scholars studying them, Marxist and non-Marxist."
AskSocialScience,34w6vm,mosestrod,2,Tue May 5 11:39:52 2015 UTC,"Does Theda Skocpol have any theory of why say the USSR 'failed'? Or what was unique about it? The problem it seems to me with her theory - and with sociology more generally - is it's ahistorical (i.e. purges the historically contingent nature of revolutions) reducing them to a programmatism, a universal set of conditions and results. Not sure if that reaction is accurate for Skocpol. This critique is however articulated well in Normative History and the Communist Essence of the Proletariat as a critique of the famous left communist G. Dauve (particularly his piece When Insurrections Die)"
AskSocialScience,34w6vm,yodatsracist,1 point,Tue May 5 12:13:23 2015 UTC,"i haven't seen her writing anything on the USSR, but I'm not a Theda completist.  So your question gets back to the methodological debate within Comparative-Historical sociology and political science. When Skocpol, Tilly, Paige, etc. burst onto the scene in the 1970's, they often used a method called ""Big Case Comparison"" (that's what Skocpol uses in States and Social revolutions). It goes too far to call it ""ahistorical"", but it looks at the historical structures in which contingencies operate, rather than the contingencies themselves. Historical sociologists generally don't do that today, and tend to focus on one, maybe two cases today (in rare cases three--though this is more common in political science with one main case, and two comparison cases in the last chapter). My adviser, for instance, has largely concentrated on a single historical state in her work, though she'll bring in outside comparisons sometimes to help explain the particularly developments of this state. That's the ""usual"" way today (unless you look at variation across a historically-tied region, like continental Latin America or Russia and its near abroad).   I'll add that one of the reason people still like and use Skocpol's theory even if the method she used has fallen out of favor is because it explains a lot without trying to explain too much. There's a great exchange in the journal Theory and Society between Skocpol and this Iranian historian (Kedourie, I think) about the Iranian Revolution, and the historian says in so many words, ""Normally I hate when people do this, but I think Skocpol's theory actually helps us better understand the Iranian Revolution."" The trick is that Skocpol's theory explains what she views as the necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for social revolution. She's not claiming to explain everything."

It seems if the residents did not file a home rule request to be annexed before the county population went to zero (at least in New York) a necessity of action would occur and the State legislature would be forced to take emergency measures to dissolve the county.

According to international law, one of the conditions of statehood is a permanent population (this stems from customary  law, as reflected in Art. 1, Montevideo Convention).  Now it is very likely that long before the population reached zero, the government would agree to merge the state into another state, as it is unlikely that a very small population could feasibly carry out the the functions of a state. However, if that doesn't happen, and people simple die out or emigrate without addressing the question of the state's international status, then you would have a truly unique and unprecedented development: the true extinction of a state.  As far as I know, international law is not very well developed from this point onward. I imagine that the territory at hand would become terra nullius and as such could be claimed by other states. Alternatively, a new people could come to inhabit the territory and form a state, although it is unlikely that this would proves successful.  Sources: Crawford, J. (2006).

Should a county in the US have a population fall to 0, and there are probably quite a few rural counties in small population states where that is a possibility, then the state government would control it by default.

AskSocialScience,34su0y,fosian,1 point,Mon May 4 08:42:20 2015 UTC,"Obviously, it depends on the state. Georgia has fixed the number of counties in the state constitution: 159. This was put in the constitution because in the past all it took to subdivide an existing county was a simple majority vote in the legislature. What was a somewhat realistic number of counties in the 1870s (89) became 162 thanks to political wheeling and dealing, pork barreling, etc.  There is part of north Fulton county (Atlanta) that was once independent Milton County. But Milton nearly went bankrupt in the Depression and voted to merge with Fulton. But now that (former Milton) is home to hundreds of millionaires, many want to secede from Fulton and bring Milton County back. But since the state constitution limits the number of counties to 159, they can't make a ""new"" one. There has been talk of putting it on the ballot as an constitutional amendment, but the main discussion has involved getting two smaller counties to merge (thus making 158 counties, which would allow for Milton under the current constitution). But there has been massive resistance from counties, even tiny ones like Taliaferro County, population 1,693. I'd imagine that people would fight to keep their county, even when the population falls into less than 50.  I'm not sure if the Georgia constitution has actually fixed the number at 159, or says that there can be ""no more than 159"". I'd imagine that would determine what would happen if an county actually hit zero residents."
AskSocialScience,34pt35,bulbishNYC,119,Sun May 3 13:49:55 2015 UTC,"Though often overlooked, I think that Georg Simmel's explorations of how formal, mathematized properties of social systems promote certain aspects of localized culture we tend to associate with rural vs. urban contexts provide a good starting point (in particular, I'd check out the essay, ""The Metropolis and Mental Life"").  In particular, the raw number of differing people in the city necessitates more widespread use of objective procedures to coordinate individuals into differing roles, promoting a sort of detached, instrumentalist orientation toward dealing with others.  At the same time, reliance on these objective procedures opens up greater room for one to take on varying roles and define one's self as one sees fit, freed from shackles of tradition or obligation to kin."

Think of your average small town (particularly around the time Simmel was writing, the late 19th to early 20th C).  There's a relative paucity of occupation roles one could viably take on, one's options severely constricted by the legacies of a small number of long-time residents.  And these residents are in more regular, frequent interaction, nearly constantly observing and attending to each others' behavior.  Thus, one is strongly compelled to submit to various traditions and obligations to friends and family when staking out one's practices and identity.  The city is different.  Because there is such a wide multitude of individuals set in more fleeting relationships and interactions, obligations to one's neighbor (and the traditions that often shape such obligations) are far less prominent and constrictive; by default, people tend to ignore each other more (also in part because attending to all the frenetic stimuli of the city would drive one nuts with stress, so people avert their focus from others).  And because cities are more diverse and involve a far more complex set of economic relations, one is free to explore a vast array of occupational niches, fashions, niche hobbies, etc.  Making more sense?"

Additionally, small towns tend to have fewer shopping opportunities and attractions, so people end up relying on government-built roads to get even their most basic needs met.   I think there's sometimes a perception that people in small towns are growing their own food and visiting the town cow or something, and that's just not true at all in my experience.

Please don't assume this is an attack on you personally, because it is not meant as one. I do have to take issue with Simmel, though, at least from what I can glean from him. Granted, for the purpose of honesty, I did not read the entire essay in detail, as it seemed to be making the same point repeatedly wherever I skimmed. Maybe you can correct me where I seem to have misunderstood Simmel's intent:    All emotional relationships between persons rest on their individuality, whereas intellectual relationships deal with persons as with numbers, that is, as with elements which, in themselves, are indifferent, but which are of interest only insofar as they offer something objectively perceivable. It is in this very manner that the inhabitant of the metropolis reckons with his merchant, his customer and with his servant, and fre- quently with the persons with whom he is thrown into obligatory association.   These relationships stand in distinct contrast with the nature of the smaller circle in which the inevitable knowledge of individual characteristics produces, with an equal in- evitability, an emotional tone in conduct, a sphere which is beyond the mere objective weighting of tasks performed and pay- ments made   What Simmel seems to be saying here is that the sheer number of people you'll have to deal with in a big city (as opposed to a small town) will force you to deal with them in a more intellectual (as opposed to emotional) manner: you don't know these people personally, so the relationship will inevitably be more ""objective"" as a matter of course.  But, assuming that this is true, I don't see what this has to do with conservatism. But Simmel does mention small-town conservatism when comparing it to ""metropolitanism."" He states that small town dwellers require ""inner upheavals"" in order to become more intellectually fluid (something they rarely get), and that city dwellers constantly have these inner upheavals, making them more ""rational"":   Instead of reacting emotionally, the metropolitan type reacts primarily in a rational manner, thus creat- ing a mental predominance through the intensification of consciousness, which in turn is caused by it.    I see. Those emotionally-focused small town types just don't have the rational faculties of we big city types. Their minds just aren't ""tested"" enough and are far surpassed by the ""metropolitan"" ability to treat fellow city-dwellers in an ""objective"" manner.   I've lived in or right near a metropolis for nearly my entire life; I've never lived in a small town. However, even I can't help but be a bit offended by the assumption that, while not outright stated, seems plain as day: to Simmel, small town folk are just ""dumber"" than city folk, and therefore are more likely to be conservative.   Nevermind that cities have more than their fair share of anti-intellectual types and, having a large number of people living in close proximity, tend to have a high rate of violent crime along with the vaunted high rate of everyday social transactions...crime that I'm sure has nothing to do with emotion and everything to do with objective calculation. ; )  Simmel seems to be making the self-satisfied claim that because city dwellers have to deal with more people, that means they're going to be more intellectual and, therefore, more ""objective"" when dealing with each other. Are there any numbers to back up this claim? Anything to support the theory that small town folks are more likely to react emotionally (and therefore less intellectually, according to Simmel) than city folk?   tl;dr: Simmel seems to be saying (in quite overwrought language, IMO) that city dwellers are just smarter and, therefore, more objective in social dealings, and that small town dwellers are slower on the uptake and more emotionally-invested and are therefore more conservative. I am, understandably, pretty unsatisfied with this answer, as it seems like a sophist's excuse for blatant in-group tribalism."

AskSocialScience,34qe71,82364,10,Sun May 3 17:14:40 2015 UTC,"This is actually a really interesting question in the taxation literature.  Charitable giving tends to be tax-deductable. That means that if you give to a charitable institution, you can deduct such expenditures on your tax form.  Okay.  That means that at higher tax rates, you're more likely to give, on the margin, because you're avoiding higher tax rates by doing so. The implication is that as marginal tax rates fall, charitable giving also falls.  This paper, which should be considered neither the first nor last word on the subject, finds that charitable giving is very sensitive to marginal income tax rates.  I'll dig around for more papers tomorrow, but that's a start."
AskSocialScience,34qe71,Integralds,2,Mon May 4 06:46:57 2015 UTC,"Talking about the United States, for reference.  When taxes are lowered is a very vague statement. What I can say is this: when charitable giving means you have to pay less in taxes, people do it. And they do it often. What's not clear, as far as I know, is the motivation. Is it because the deduction exists, or because people are typically more focused on charity than state-sponsored welfare in the United States?  What I mean by this is that in the United States, there is a very high level of private social spending. Unlike in most other countries in the OECD, the United States spends very little on government-sponsored social spending. As Caminada and Martin note, the US has extremely high levels of private social spending (i.e. donating to charities!). I can't be certain whether or not this is because of tax deductions, because I don't actually know if other countries have similar tax deductions. Maybe it's based on a perception of need, or cultural tolerance, or tax evasion. One of the things we know is that when the tax breaks are extended/increased, then donations also increase. Perhaps it's because of the perception that they'll come back up, however. So I kept looking for more information on the subject, and found a report by the Joint Committee on Taxation [LINK WILL START A DOWNLOAD OF THE PDF], which details on pg. 46 the history of donations and deductions. What's interesting to note is 1986, actually. It's estimated that after 1986, charitable donations dropped for a year at least. The reason, I'd guess, is because of the tax overhaul that happened with the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which greatly simplified the tax code and closed numerous loopholes and deductions. In 1981, non-itemizers had been allowed to take the charity deduction, but in 1986 that was removed. And deductions went down, as did donations.  So it's hard to say for sure, and many journals and books talk about it as if it's a given that charitable giving increases with lower taxes, or more deductions for giving. And indeed, that may be borne out with the evidence. But I can't find a definitive test, because economics doesn't work like that usually, so it's hard to say with 100% certainty (as with everything, I'd say)."
AskSocialScience,34ql7j,inquisitive872,5,Sun May 3 18:14:31 2015 UTC,"Human Capital Investment theory covers this fairly nicely, and I highly recommend you read this very excellent summary of it here.  That said, let's think of education in terms of a human capital investment.  So most people know what capital is within the context of economics, but very roughly put is some good or asset that is used in the production of another good, things like machines, factories, delivery trucks, etc.  Capital is a good that can help make other goods.  Human capital is similar.  Human capital is the sum total of the knowledge, skills, abilities, and other attributes (often referred to in the business world as KSAOs) that a person employs to create economic value.  Are you a great cook?  Then you have great human capital for a restaurant, though you might not for a bank, call center, or factory.    Now, human capital isn't static.  You can increase it.  Suppose you were a great cook, but you really wanted to be a mathematician (though I can't imagine why :P).  You're not stuck forever being a cook.  You can go to college and get a degree in math.  This increases your human capital, and the years of training you undergo to pursue this expanded human capital is called a human capital investment.  So how does that grow the economy?    Think about it this way: by definition, expanded human capital means that you add more value to the firm with whom you are employed than another person exactly like you, minus your education.  If you have a degree in accounting, you're likely a better accountant than some other random applicant without a degree or otherwise comparable experience in accounting.  They might be able to file 8 TPS reports a day, while you (with all your fancy school learning) can file 12 TPS reports a day.  This allows the firm to produce more for less, which makes them more competitive, and in the aggregate, increases production."

It's not inherently good or bad, but it is highly disruptive to people's way of life.  Entrepreneurs are characterized by their willingness to take big risks, but most of society is risk averse and desires some measure of stability. Out of this constant upheaval, Schumpeter believed that the people (led by intellectuals) would demand a welfare-state socialist government, precisely to end the destructive aspect of capitalist creation and thereby reclaim a more stable less-risky life.  Schumpeter was not a socialist himself, he was unabashedly capitalist and a good chunk of the beginning of Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy is a debunking of Marx, but he was pessimistic about the ability of the public to weather the effects of capitalism."

It advocates the adoption of “nation-building” policies that foster the development of a common national identity. The case of Tanzania, and the contrast of Tanzania with its East African neighbor, Kenya, is the focus of this essay. It is argued that Tanzania’s serious approach to forging a common national identity attractive across ethnic groups — which takes the form of extensive linguistic, educational, and institutional reforms — offers a model for other less-developed countries that inherited ethnic divisions in the post-independence period. An overview of empirical evidence based on original field data collection is presented, which shows that this nation-building approach has allowed ethnically diverse communities in rural Tanzania to achieve considerable success in local fund-raising for primary schools, while ethnically diverse Kenyan communities have largely failed in this task.

AskSocialScience,34ncj6,JayWalken,19,Sat May 2 19:05:22 2015 UTC,"I am not an expert in this subject, so I will only try to explain Polanyi's theory in this regard. I welcome any corrections to my interpretation. My response addresses an important change in the way people worked that took place during the Industrial Revolution. However it seems to follow from this theory that the changes in the organization of work influenced the attitudes towards work you mention and not the other way around. Therefore, this approach is materialistic.  Firs of all we must have a more nuanced understanding of Aristotle's ""disdain for work"".  Quoting from Polanyi's ""Societies and Economic Systems"" in The Great Transformation, pp.56-57:   Airstotle distinguishes on production for use against production for gain as the essence of householding [œconomia] proper [...] In denouncing the principle of production for gain as boundless and limitless, ""as not natural to man"", Aristotle was, in effect, aiming at the crucial point , namely, the divorce of  the economic motive from all concrete  social relationships which  would by their very nature set a limit to that motive.   As we can see, Aristotle didn't criticize all work, but rather excessive work. The creation of a system which sets no upper limit for work was the main change in this regard.  Polanyi goes on to say, in ""The Self Regulating Market and the Fictitous Commodities"", The Great Transformation, pp. 78-79:   But the more complicated industrial production became, the more numerous were the elements of industry the supply of which had to be safeguarded [...] In a commercial society their supply could be organized in one way only: by being made available for purchase [...] therefore labor, land and money had to be transformed into commodities in order to keep production going. [...] All along the line, human society had become an accessory of the economic system.   The organization of work had to undergo a change to satisfy the demands of non-stop industrial production. It had to be put on sale (wage labor). This meant the distribution and quantity of labor (where and how much people work) would answer only to the needs of industrial production. This form of socioeconomic organization does not set an upper limit for work, unlike the œikos, for instance.  Without this upper limit, the time dedicated to work went up. More importantly, it became the social center of human activity.  You could say work became ""good"" when it became ""a good"" (commodity).  Note: I omitted why industrial labor production requires this kind of non-stop activity. That is another story entirely which is detailed in the aforementioned chapter.  I hope the explanation is clear and that my interpretation is on point. Polanyi's writing is very subtle.  TL;DR: Aristotle actually criticized boundless work. Industrial production requires a steady supply of labor. Limits on the use of labor can harm production. Thus labor had to become unrestricted and became the main thing in people's lives.

AskSocialScience,34kqls,supercow444444,2,Sat May 2 00:26:55 2015 UTC,"I answered a similar question here, so I'll give you a similar answer here:  I don't think there's much question that that good teachers lead to good economic outcomes. Here is a good study that finds the following (straight from the abstract):   Students assigned to high-VA teachers are more likely to attend college, attend higher- ranked colleges, earn higher salaries, live in higher SES neighborhoods, and save more for retirement. They are also less likely to have children as teenagers. Teachers have large impacts in all grades from 4 to 8. On average, a one standard deviation improvement in teacher VA in a single grade raises earnings by about 1% at age 28. Replacing a teacher whose VA is in the bottom 5% with an average teacher would increase the present value of students’ lifetime income by more than $250,000 for the average class- room in our sample. We conclude that good teachers create substantial economic value and that test score impacts are helpful in identifying such teachers.   They refer to ""high-VA"" teachers. ""VA"" stands for ""value-added"", and as their measure of value added, they look at increases in standardized test scores. The big issues with this study (and any study regarding teacher contributions) are (a) we don't know if teachers teach students or if good students are just drawn to certain teachers and (b) we don't know if higher test scores actually translate to better life outcomes. Any paper that doesn't account for (a) and (b) won't do much good.  To control for (a), the authors of that paper look at random student assignments within schools. The account for (b), they follow students well into their adult lives and find the changes listed above.  So, that covers the direct benefits of education to the people being educated. But, there are also spillover effects. This paper estimates that ""a percentage point increase in the supply of college graduates raises high school drop-outs’ wages by 1.9%, high school graduates’ wages by 1.6%, and college graduates wages by 0.4%."" This paper finds that ""completing high school reduces the probability of incarceration by about .76 percentage points for whites and 3.4 percentage points for blacks."" Both of these studies are careful to control for the fact that the kinds of people who get educated are already somewhat different from the kinds of people who don't get educated; they make an effort to determine the specific effect of education.  So, education is great for everyone involved and even those who just around to enjoy other people being educated. But, does higher expenditures translate to good teachers and better outcomes? Many studies are mixed. For a review check here.   However, some of those studies may be flawed. This paper points out that, when accounting for non-wage benefits for teachers in addition to wages, ""raising teacher wages by 10% reduces high school dropout rates by 3% to 4%.""  So, we could raise expenditures to get better teachers. Or, we could just hire more teachers; this paper found that small class sizes improve outcomes (especially for minorities and poor kids), but that teacher characteristics don't make a huge difference.  On the other hand, this study of the Chicago Public Schools (another place where teacher salaries are a contentious issue) found that teacher quality does make a big difference -- especially for lower-ability students.  tl;dr: The link between high quality education and better communities is very clear. The link between raising salaries and high quality education is less clear."

AskSocialScience,34ifdr,Enavantfanfan,16,Fri May 1 16:54:10 2015 UTC,"As with Japanese, the grammar can complicate direct comparisons with English. For example, where in English you'd say ""I bought a new one"" In French it's just ""J'ai acheté un nouveau"", so sometimes adjectives on their own function as a noun would in English.  Therefore in certain cases where nominalised adjectives are used in French, it's just the natural way to say it.  In general, though, you hear quite often ""les noirs"" (blacks). A quick Linguee search confirms this to be the case, even though ""les personnes noires"" exists too. You can see that for the first link, ""les noirs"" is rarely translated as ""blacks"" except for historical translations.  ""Les handicapés"" is also common, but less so. This time it's outnumbered by ""Les personnes handicapées"". I think this shows the shift you're talking about.  I think the shift from ""les noirs"" to ""black people"" is somewhat imitative of modern English usage, though. At least to my ear, it doesn't sound entirely natural yet in French.  Also worth noting is that this ""people-positive"" grammar is obviously closely associated with sociological factors. French people have absolutely no problem with saying ""the English"". I've barely ever heard ""English people"". I think that's true of English too; people aren't so careful to say ""American people"" instead of ""Americans"". Although I'm aware that that's toeing the line between nominalised adjectives and nouns proper.

AskSocialScience,34enwq,Barrilete_Cosmico,56,Thu Apr 30 15:01:52 2015 UTC,"One typical answer is that settler mortality from disease is related to building inclusive institutions or extractive institutions. Inclusive institutions are good for long-term GDP growth, extractive institutions are bad for it.  Tropical diseases, and malaria in particular, are one of the main causes of relatively high rates of settler mortality, and obviously are endemic to areas closer to the equator.  The real basis for this argument is Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson's ""Colonial origins of comparative development"" 2001 AER article (pdf, summary, and it's even important enough to get a short Wiki article which very rare for articles).  Acemoglu and Robinson later developed this argument into a full book called Why Nations Fail (and a corresponding blog of the same name).  Both of these outline their broader argument which is not just related to settler mortality or the equator, but a real comparative institutionalist perspective on how institutional forms are related to long term economic growth more broadly.  Some have questioned this thesis, particularly the empirical backing of the original article (David Albuoy has a pretty thorough attempt to refute the empirical origins in his 2012 piece ""The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation: Comment"" pdf, but you should read the Acemoglu response as well) (this is his third attempt to takedown this article, I believe, with early critiques coming out in 2004 and 2006), but the original Acemoglu et al. argument is still very widely cited and, to my knowledge, the most convincing explanation for this correlation (Acemoglu's strong responses to Albuoy, to my mind, also bolster the robustness of the argument).  The causal chain looks roughly:  Tropical disease-->settler mortality-->institutional form-->long term growth.  This obviously does not explain everything (for instance, why some areas have settlers in the first place while others don't--for that you'd need to go for other explanations, many focusing on the directionality of trade networks/geographical limitations for diffusions in places like Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel or Ian Morris's Why West Rules--For Now), but it does help explain some differences, particularly in colonial settlements.  However, some of these GDP disparities were already in place by about 1500 when these settler movements start.  If I recall, it does not take into account things like population density at (and immediately after) colonization, which also obviously has an effect on what sort of institutions settlers can set up.   Looking at it this way, again, disease, this time diseases that jumped from livestock to humans like small pox, plays a role but it's the opposite one: here, disease lowers indigenous (rather than settler) population density and makes colonization easier and enables again more inclusive institutions.  Many of the rich colonies far from the equator basically had their indigenous populations wiped out or otherwise displaced almost entirely--not just America and Canada, but Argentina, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, and (if focusing on Khoisan rather than the various Bantus) South Africa--presumably leading to different institutional forms which led to different long term growth rates.  Compare this to places like Brazil, Bolivia, Southern Mexico, most of Sub-Saharan Africa, most Melanesian and Polynesian Islands, etc. where indigenous groups make up a much larger percentage of the population.  Natives can also be displaced or incorporated in other ways, and disease does not necessarily have to play a role (see, for example, the growth of the Han and the Russians); but again we see that institutions people set up become important, and that the rapid growth of groups often occurs on East-West axes rather than North-South ones (Diamond and others argue that crops and other technologies can move more easily East-West where climates tend to be similar rather than North-South where climates differ at a faster rate).  In these cases too the inclusive institutions help the indigenous groups to a certain degree, but the institutions seem to have been set up largely with the Han/Russian ""settlers"" in mind and in these regions the Han/Russians tend to hold the dominant economic positions.  Once extractive institutions are set for whatever reason, Acemoglu and Robinson's book argues pretty convincingly, they do tend to have pretty serious effects on long term growth.  Slavery being an example of perhaps the most extractive institution with long term negative effects on both origin countries for slaves and the economic development of areas with slave-based economies, but we can't really understand slavery from a purely ""areas with malaria"" perspective, because obviously European racial ideology (as well as the the form of pre-existing institutions--look at how the Japanese protests helped end the Portuguese East Asian slave trade) played a huge role in the growth of slavery.     So we can say, a variety of reasons, we tend to see extractive institutions closer to the equator and inclusive one further away from it.  Some areas that have inclusive institutions today had some advantages around 1500 (technology including high calorie per acre crops; favorable disease environments) that helped them expand rapidly, setting up extractive institutions in some places and inclusive institutions in others.  These advantages c. 1500 were to some degree facilitated by differences in physical geography.  We also tend to see inclusive institutions resulting in higher long-term economic growth than extractive institutions."

It meant that we were able to use horsepower to start ploughing fields etc. whilst africans couldn't exactly do the same with lions. A more productive agricultural system allows for more-than-subsistence production. Any surpluses can therefore be traded. Then comes the creation of a market. The creation of things like markets creates the need for institutions, so these developed earlier in Europe (btw I don't really know anything about Asian history so I dunno what they were up to at this time). Namely, they developed first in England because England transitioned away from feudalism into capitalism first (for a host of reasons). Capitalism -> innovation -> agricultural revolution -> less labour needed to farm simply for subsistence -> the creation of towns etc. and people starting to manufacture other things.   So now Europe has these developed institutions and they are expanding capitalism worldwide. Here's where yodatsracist's point comes in. If the climate was intolerable and disease was rife we tended to invade a country, but instead of settling there and introducing our law/economic institutions, we just extracted resources. So when we upped and left these countries were left with no developed (western) institutions and depleted natural resources. On the other hand if we found a place with favourable conditions (N. America for example) we would settle there. This normally included largely killing off the indigenous population (through disease, slavery or near-slavery etc.), but hey on the plus side we implemented western institutions. This lead to growth."
AskSocialScience,34enwq,mstb5,3,Thu Apr 30 16:57:34 2015 UTC,"Francis Fukuyama discusses the geography-prosperity correlation in chapter 15 of his book, Political Order and Political Decay. He makes the claim that this relationship was traditionally the other way around, while places near the equator being much more prosperous. For example, in 1660, the Caribbean island of Barbados generated more trade than all the other English colonies combined. Fukuyama claims that there was a reversal of fortune in the past 500 years, largely due to changing technology and industrialization.   Normally, economic theory would predict that those tropical and subtropical regions that hosted wealtrhy agrarian communities should have an advantage with regard to industrialization, since they had the largest stocks of labor and capital. Acemoglu, Robinson, and Johnson argue that the reason this did not happen was due again to institutions: older wealthy regions with dense populations attracted European colonists, who enslaved those populations and created extractive institutions. Those institutions then served to block the development of more open, competitive market economies that were necessary for industrial development. By comparison, poor, sparsely settled regions were not burdened with the legacy of bad institutions and permitted more inclusive ones to appear.   And the change due to industrialization was not the only one:   The impact of climate and geography can obviously change over time as a result of technology; thus the Caribbean sugar trade could not have happened absent transatlantic shipping, and it became far less competitive with the development of alternatives to sugarcane like beet sugar."

I suppose it's up for debate, but I've always found that firearms are the easiest way to kill a person (jk!).  Looking at India compared to the US, in 2010 the respective homicides by firearm is 7% vs. 60% respectively (using the UNDOC tool). Here's kinda a source, though I don't know how reliable they are (probably one step above Wikipedia). But it does seem that for many developed countries with very low rates of gun ownership, homicide is relatively low too. Though, I certainly wonder if lumping all homicides in with firearm related homicide makes senses (that article seems to think that more guns = less homicide, but the data looks an absolute mess).  Of course, it's obvious that less guns ought to mean less gun deaths, but that's at least one thing that possible idea. I wonder, if we could find a good comparable measure of violent crime, like some sort of measure of assault, if the same relation would hold: is the rate of assault in Mumbai lower than that of New York City? And especially assualt with a deadly weapon: is it just that Americans, having easier access to guns mean when it's time to murder we'll do the job right? Vs. in India, where firearm homicide is a tiny minority of homicide, does is there a comparable rise in assualt?  Well... After thinking all this and then looking around some more: I found this website, and after browsing the comparisons and looking up their little definitions, I found something odd: Under the category of ""Murders > Per 100,000 people,"" the rates are 5.5 for India and 5.9 for the US. Apparently, this measure is explained as:   Intentional homicide rate is the estimate of intentional homicides in a country as a result of domestic disputes that end in a killing, interpersonal violence, violent conflicts over land resources, inter-gang violence over turf or control, and predatory violence and killing by armed groups. The term, intentional homicide, is broad, but it does not include all intentional killing. In particular, deaths arising from armed conflict are usually considered separately. The difference is usually described by the organisation of the killing. Individuals or small groups usually commit homicide, whereas the killing in armed conflict is usually committed by more or less cohesive groups of up to several hundred members. Two main sources of data are presented: criminal justice (law enforcement) measures (this series), supplemented by data from national statistical agencies, and measures from public health sources (see other intentional homicide series). These various sources measure slightly different phenomena and are therefore unlikely to provide identical numbers.""    I'm not entirely sure how to interpret this, but it's interesting to see that Mumbai/India's homocide rate is well below the NYC/US except for this particular measure."
AskSocialScience,34f6su,Kraftz,2,Fri May 1 15:41:55 2015 UTC,"I think one of the biggest factors you left out is the drug war.  The drug war causes a lot of homicides. And the products of the drug war cause even more. For example, large street gangs which compete against each other for the control of territory for drug distribution. This article quotes the NYPD chief saying that two thirds of all homicides in NYC are drug or gang related.  In India, enforcement of drug laws is much more lax. As a result there aren't such huge profits to be made from distributing drugs as there are in the US. While there is organized crime in India, the phenomenon of ""street gangs"" is quite rare. Generally, Indian organized crime is concerned with stuff like prostitution, controlling labor unions and dockyards, the movie industry, etc. Trade in drugs is mostly extra-territorial, meaning opium grown in India gets exported to other countries. There are no huge profits to be made selling it on the streets in India. It used to be legal until a few years ago (with government licensed shops selling cannabis and opium). Now it's technically illegal, but enforcement is very lax. Without the big profits, there's little reason for gangs to engage in turf wars for control of distribution territory.  I think this is one of the more important reasons why homicide rates are lower in India in general."

Soldiers killing other soldiers isn't intentional homicide in the legal sense even if the act is quite similar in its mechanics.

IIRC, the health of an economy is more related to the GDP versus Debt rather than Spending vs. Income. Also, to my understanding, government debt is fundamentally different from individual debt--we don't necessarily have to pay it off.   Somewhat correct, it generally only matters in terms of debt/gdp not absolute deficit terms. With GDP growth (either inflationary or real growth) you can maintain the same debt/gdp while still running a deficit (in the case of the US its generally quoted at around $400b).  For if debt matters and how there are two distinct mainstream camps here;   Long-term debt is not sub-optimal and there exists some level of debt which can be considered optimal. Long-term debt is sub-optimal (reduces welfare) and thus we should aim to zero debt.   Neither of these propositions means you can't run short-term debt during a recession to support deficit spending, you absolutely should do this. I would suggest (priors, neither camp has sufficient evidence to really be right) the first proposition to be correct, also that the optimal level is somewhere between 18% and 30% of GDP for the US.   Beyond the optimal rate of long-term debt the more important issue is debt sustainability, does a structural deficit exist and how significant is it. The US has a fairly large structural deficit problem (recent testimony on this here), while its not going to cause significant problems for at least another decade (if not much longer) dealing with it soon is much less painful then dealing with it later.   Edit: Also worth mentioning that you should always have some level of short-term debt even if its not used to support spending, its necessary to execute monetary policy and is an essential instrument for banking."

Many non-economists are biased against a national debt due to their observations about personal debt.  Nations, though, never retire to live off their savings, and thus can run a deficit perpetually.  As /u/HealthcareEconomist3 points out in his/her edit, some level of national debt is actually essential, so that nations should carry debt perpetually.

For public debt we are balancing public spending flexibility against individuals disposable income (IE how high taxes are) and capital creation (sovereign debt ties in extremely heavy to capital markets, too much or too little and the rate of capital creation falls).  The largest ? on this issue is what effects debt have on long-run growth (very hard to investigate as two countries that are identical other then debt levels don't exist, you can't build a control so figuring out causal effects is a problem) and also more generally on the legitimacy of deficit spending what fiscal multipliers look like (this is super super contentious, we have some fairly good evidence that they can be fairly high during the recessionary period but there is evidence they are persistently below 1 outside of this in advanced economies).   How would we deal with this structural deficit problem?   A mixture of tax increases, spending cuts and simply more efficient spending/revenue collection. The aim would be no net reduction in services (with a couple of exceptions, retiree healthcare & cash transfers for the wealthy as the main examples) but rather simply redesigning what we already do to reduce distortionary costs and waste.  On the spending side an example of the types of things we would be looking at are things like this, the DoD procurement system and how federal spending in states/districts is designed (old example but until ACA came along 4 states made a net profit on Medicaid).

AskSocialScience,34adxv,OmicronNine,11,Thu Apr 30 09:05:44 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I don't think there's good data on this.  I know of two nationally representative surveys of Muslims.  The first, conducted by the Pew Forum, was published in 2007 as ""Muslim Americans: Middle Class and Mostly Mainstream"".  The second, conducted by the Pew Research Center, was published in 2011 as ""Muslim Americans: No Signs of Growth in Alienation or Support for Extremism"".  (The Pew Forum focuses on religion and public life; the Pew Research Center on U.S. politics)  Neither asked questions about Sunni or Shi'a opinions on one another.  But we can get some sense from the other questions asked.  While the respondents mostly identify with a tradition (65% Sunni, 11% Shi'a), another 11% specifically volunteered something general (e.g. ""just a Muslim"") and 15% gave a different group (Sufi, Ahmadi, etc.) or chose ""don't know"".  If we associate poor Sunni-Shi'a relations with extremism, we wouldn't expect them here based on the relatively few worries American Muslims have about extremism. In the first survey, 61% and in the second survey 60% of American Muslims were ""very"" or ""somewhat"" concerned about the possible rise of extremism among American Muslims.  The second survey asked more detailed questions, like How much support for extremism is there among American Muslims? 6% say ""a great deal"",  15% say ""a fair amount"", 64% ""not much"" or ""not at all"".  Only 4% of American Muslims say that Muslim extremism is increasing in America.  Nearly half (48%) also thought that American Muslim leaders hadn't done enough to speak out against extremism, while about a third (34%) thought they had done all they should.  So what you see is that American is Islam isn't really associated with the sort of extremism you'd expect to see associated with the very factious fighting you currently seem in parts of the Middle East and Pakistan (and to a lesser extent, other places).   Further, American Muslims seem to have embraced pluralism roughly in line with their neighbors of other religions.  When asked, ""Which religion leads to eternal life?""  Only 34% of American Muslims believe that only Islam leads to eternal life, while 56% say ""many religions"" do.  While this doesn't deal directly with the Sunni-Shi'a split, it shows the broad pluralistic acceptance of the American Muslim community.  As a comparison, almost the same proportion of American Christians (30%) say that ""only Christianity"" leads to eternal life.  Among Evangelical Christians specifically, 51% say ""only Christianity"" can lead to eternal life, while 45% say ""many religions"" can (among ""high commitment Muslims"", by the Pew's reasoning, the numbers are similar: 52% vs. 39%).  So broadly speaking, at least on this rather specific sort of question, American Muslims are about as pluralistic as American Christians.    While the question isn't addressed specifically, from the questions we do have answered, I think broadly we see no reason to suspect that Sunni-Shi'a relations in America would be particularly fraught.  I'm sure there are specific cases where there might be local tensions and divisions that fall along sectarian lines, but there are probably many other local tensions and divisions that break along other lines (cf. /u/john_the_fisherman's article).  I'm Jewish and we have an old joke that a man needs two synagogues: one in which to pray, to find a community in, to raise his children in, and to grow old in; one to never set foot in so long as he lives.  On the national level, however, I can't think of any place where there are parallel sectarian institutions.  Most major national Muslim institutions in America (Muslim Student Associations; CAIR and other advocacy groups) seem to have a Sunnni dominant leadership (with leadership generally being immigrants or the children of immigrants, though there are some converts as well, like Ibrahim Hooper and Mahdi Bray) but this reflects Muslim demographics nationally.  Off the top of my head, I can't bring to mind any parallel national, specifically Shi'a institutions, which you'd expect if there were tension rather than overall cooperation between American Sunnis and Shi'as and Shi'as felt a strong need for their own leadership."

AskSocialScience,34bt3s,sochastheanswer,6,Wed Apr 29 22:05:54 2015 UTC,"I will assume that we are speaking only about developed countries as the gender issues are different in developing countries.  I believe the greatest difference between sexism and other forms of discrimination that utilize a power gradient is that both parties are negatively affected by it -- not just the underpowered party -- and we have developed compensatory rather than equalizing ""solutions"" to manage the issues.  There is also the issue that we have the tendency to force political changes before we are culturally ready for them, which is perhaps beneficial, but causes issues in its own right. (source, pdf)  For example, let's look at the most easily-quantified expression of power: money.  Women have less wealth than men.  As a society, we try to inappropriately compensate for this through such things as men paying for a date (which only reinforces the power gradient), women having fairly open access to a male partner's finances, and men taking more dangerous occupations.  When an attempt is made to correct the wealth gap, only the gap is directly targeted without addressing any of the cultural compensations.  This can be seen as creating a new unfair situation where men and women have equal wealth, yet men would still have more dangerous jobs, spend more money on women than vice-versa, etc., causing men to become the disadvantaged ones.  (source)  For any of the other power gradients we're working to overcome, this wouldn't happen because there are not independent pre-existing compensatory mechanisms.  As a result of gender issues being led primarily by feminists, ""gender issues"" is practically synonymous with ""women's issues"" rather than being inclusive to men.  There will be limited progress in gender issues until it is recognized that there is no such thing as women's issues or men's issues - only gender issues that affect both parties and need to be considered as a whole.  Although I agree with your premise that a patriarchy clearly exists, your example of its ""obviousness"" it is terribly inadequate.  How does the sexualization of women in media express a patriarchy?  Sexualization is a marketing tactic because it works, not because of a patriarchy, and all forms of it (sexualized men, women, and other) target all audiences regardless of gender, sexual orientation, or any other demographic.  Would you think there was less of a patriarchy if they put niqabs or burqas on?  I'm not trying to challenge your underlying view, but you need to develop a stronger support than that if you want to discuss it productively with people who disagree with the existence of a patriarchy.  I personally find this to be a very emotionally-exhausting topic so I probably won't be posting anymore on this, but I hope that this at least gives a starting point with sources for discussion."
AskSocialScience,34bt3s,Fit-Kucheka,5,Thu Apr 30 05:55:43 2015 UTC,"The sexualization part was just a single example I used, I didn't want to list out all the ways patriarchy is obvious in every social institution so I chose mass media as it being, in my opinion, the most obvious because everyone is familiar with how sexualized women are in the media and even if they don't notice the difference between the sexualization of men and women in the media, simply bringing it up would be enough to realize it. Like for instance in a television ad, you notice a person is sexualized, then ask yourself who this product is marketed to. Just asking that would bring to light a huge difference in who is sexualized more and for whom."
AskSocialScience,34bt3s,Fit-Kucheka,7,Thu Apr 30 06:11:24 2015 UTC,"Right, I'm just disagreeing and saying I think that's one of the less obvious or less genuine examples.  I think the wealth gap and ""male-as-default"" are probably the most obvious genuine examples of patriarchy.    Are you sure those ads are marketing to whom you think they're marketing to?  75% of women identify as being the primary shoppers for their household.  Sexualized women in marketing targets women as much if not more than it targets men -- which in itself could be seen as an effect of patriarchy due to demands on women, but when addressing this, most people arguing that point neglect the fact that similar aesthetic demands are placed on men and men experience similarly-targeted marketing.  I hope I've sufficiently complexed the issue that it doesn't seem like the most obvious expression of patriarchy."
AskSocialScience,34bt3s,aidrocsid,-2,Thu Apr 30 06:20:44 2015 UTC,"The wealth gap is an example of the affect of gender roles on society, but it's a reflection of women's choices, not some conspiracy. Those choices are certainly sculpted by people's continued protection and coddling of them, but they're their choices none the less.  I don't understand why people think they'll give more agency to women by finding as many ways as possible to deny the agency of women. The fact of the matter is that women who do go into these high-paying fields and take serious careers overwhelmingly do very well.  Women are significantly overrepresented in college and women who do choose the same sorts of, say, business career paths as men can do quite well in those fields. What you find is that women are unwilling to take high-risk or inflexible jobs. There are very few women on fishing boats, construction sites, and riding the backs of dump trucks. That's a choice. It's a perfectly legitimate choice.  If it's not a legitimate choice, why don't more women's studies students get into STEM fields? Where are all the feminist engineers and electricians?

So if you show your emotions as a man, you're being feminine which is seen as bad. Even though there's nothing wrong with femininity or showing emotions.

Conversely, I see many things indicating male disposability, which would seem to directly conflict with patriarchy. I also see many things for which patriarchy is blamed seeming to have other causes. The wage gap, for example, is almost always cited with complete disregard for female agency. Women don't choose to avoid dangerous or laborious work, it's all the patriarchy.  Sexism exists.

AskSocialScience,34bt3s,h-v-smacker,25,Sun May 3 02:05:14 2015 UTC,"I think your question is a little malformed. It's true that nobody denies that it's possible to be racist or that racist people exist - just one look at the KKK or a neo-Nazi group makes that obvious. But it's also true that nobody denies that it's possible to be sexist or that sexist people exist - no matter how far to the right someone is, for example, you can get them to complain about the Taliban's treatment of women.  What's harder is getting people to accept that systemic biases built into the system exist and that these biases are detrimental to people of certain races or certain genders. The idea that America, for instance, is systemically racist is a very hot-button issue and I think you're more likely to get brushed aside as loony if you claim that the system is set up to incarcerate black men, destroy black families, devalue black lives, and so on. You get a similar amount of pushback if you claim that we live in a patriarchal society, etc. This despite copious evidence for both kinds of claims.  There is, of course, still the question of why there's pushback on these kinds of claims, and specifically (since you asked) why there's pushback on the patriarchy. As Allan Johnson points out in his book The Gender Knot (chapter 7):   Perhaps the most efficient way to keep patriarchy going is to promote the idea that it doesn't exist in the first place. Patriarchy, we might say, is just a figment of angry feminist imagination. Or, if it does exist, it's by reputation only, a shadow of its former self that no longer amounts to much in people's lives.   The rest of that chapter proceeds to explain how this is done. For instance, the patriarchy hides certain things: the work women do in cleaning houses or raising children doesn't ""count"" as work, the comments of women in meetings are ignored while the identical contributions of men are taken seriously, masculinity is taken as the default (so, we assume that everyone on reddit is a ""he"" until proven otherwise, womens issues are seen as a special set of issues, etc.).  (Johnson also points out how this works similarly when it comes to race: the news will never mention anybody's race unless they're non-white, because white is the assumed race, for instance.)  So in short, one reason the patriarchy is ignored (and the reason systemic racial prejudice is also ignored) is because if people were alive to it, it would be much harder for it to survive and persist. If you do (rightfully) believe that we live in a racist, patriarchal society, you're that much less likely to be happy with it and you're that much more likely to work against it. That this hasn't happened enough to wipe out racism and to wipe out the patriarchy is a result of the ways in which these structures of systemic oppression succeed in cloaking themselves.  Another huge reason (as Johnson points out) is denial. People don't want to admit these things exist, for pretty obvious reasons: it can be painful to acknowledge that we live in a patriarchy or in a racist society, especially if you're someone like a white male who can avoid these painful realities by just ignoring them.  The rest of that Johnson chapter names a number of other ways the patriarchy (and systemic racism) cloak themselves - let me know if you're interested in the rest."

Personally, I think part of the challenge of this is because when you call out systematic oppression, people suddenly are forced to recognize they actually benefit from racism or sexism and then become incredibly defensive.   What I've found debating these issues online for years, is that even flat out racists and sexists will go into full defensive mode if you call out their racism and sexism, in one post they could be arguing black people are sub-human and women are all whores, yet you call that out and they become all offended ""How dare you call me a racist?

It is only true if you happen to have a both indivdualist and egalitarian value system. That means, if you think people should pursue individual self-actualization, individual goals or dreams, and get equal chance to. People with a more conservative value system, such as thinking people should follow socially prescribe roles and find happiness in discharging their socially prescribed duties, will not necessarily have a problem with it. Yet, the very same people, with the very same value system, can still hate racism, because racism does not play any sort of a constructive role in a traditional society at all. But gender roles can and do, they belong very strongly to the  very fabric of a traditional, read, not individual goals oriented but prescribed roles and duties oriented life.   So even if fully admitted, a non-individualist non-egalitarian person, such as a Christian or a Confucian could still far easier support patriarchy than racism.   If you have difficulties imagining how a conservative, traditional mind works, one easy move is just to think in the context of a historicizing fantasy show, like Game of Thrones. There is this basic idea that you are born not to pursue your own desires but duty to king and family. So you are a Lannister and your duty is to make the family more prosperous and powerful. You need to make many kids, because many will die on the battlefield, and you need to defeat your enemies on the battlefield. So it sort of becomes obvious that the men focusing more on fighting and the women on birthing is sort of a useful approach to it, men being soldiers, women making soldiers. Not the only possible one, of course, there are potential alternatives, but one fairly obvious and working setup. On the other hand, you absolutely don't need to have some kind of a racial hatred to the essosi or dornish people, this plays no role in your social duty at all. So this would be roughly how the conservative mind works.  Of course the liberal mind works completely the opposite, it begins wit the individualistic idea of people following their own callings in life and not fulfilling prescribed roles, and from there it is very easy to go to saying if men and women have different chances, different amount of freedom to follow their callings then that is bad. So your model is right, but only for liberal minds, who are already individualistic. I wanted to point it out."

AskSocialScience,346wnv,joshm60,13,Wed Apr 29 17:16:47 2015 UTC,"I'm actually going to disagree with u/cinemabaroque on this one. At least as we define/understand marriage in Western societies, then no there were same-sex marriages before the 20th century.  In fact, there wasn't homosexuality as we understand it today - a more or less fixed identity rather than a set of behaviors.  Barry Adam's ""Structural Foundations of the Gay World"" or John D'Emilio's *Sexual Politics, Sexual Communities explain this very well.  In a nutshell, before the industrialization of the 18th/19th century, opposite-sex marriage was structurally required.  People didn't have a choice to seek out romantic relationships - gay or straight - so while some could have homosexual sex here and there it could not be a defining feature of your life.  Industrialization allowed people to earn individual wages by working in factories, say, which gave a new level of individual autonomy.  They could then leave their tight-knit family and community structures and live on their own in the city, seeking out the people and relationships that they wanted.    For a culture to recognize same-sex marriage, as we understand it today, they would first need the social structure that allowed for individual sexual choice - that is a precondition for people developing gay identities and establishing same-sex relationships. While non-Western cultures have recognized various forms of same-sex relationships, these were either temporary or within a different cultural understanding of gender as non-binary, as with Native American Two Spirits.  So, for instance, a biological female may have been able to take the role of a man, heading a household and owning property, thereby getting a wife too (as property), but this would not have been a lesbian relationship as we define it today. Similarly, a Two Spirit Native American may have lived in a cultural midway between male and female and had relationships, but these would not be same-sex marriages because they were not conducted under the rubric of a gender binary culture.    That is, to have same-sex marriages as we define them today (two people of the same gender in a lifelong exclusive partnership) you first need to have a gender binary, a system under which two-way partnerships exist and are social recognized, and a social structure that allows individuals to enter into same-sex relationships.  These did not exist in cultures before the 20th century in the West."

James Wilson, in ""The Strategy of Protest: Problems of Negro Civic Action,"" argues that disruption is what makes protest effective, and you can cause disruption via violent means or non-violent means, and depending on the context, one of these might be easier or otherwise preferable in terms of what ""works better."" There is lots of back and forth about this - some think disruption is what it's about but that violence only works in some cases, some think disruption isn't important or is unhelpful, etc.  Another important view is Michael Lipsky's in ""Protest as a Political Resource,"" which argues that for a protest to be successful it has to juggle the needs of four groups: the various sorts of people making up the protest (which of course you need to keep together if you want the protest to go on in the first place), the media (which the protest relies on for exposure), third parties in the political conflict (which the protest has to try to get on its side), and the people capable of granting the goals of the protest (I'm sure you can imagine why it's important to have some impact on these people). As you can imagine, sometimes violence is going to help with some or all of these things, and sometimes non-violence is going to help with some or all, and sometimes violence will help with some but non-violence will help with others and they'll conflict and then you get a confusing looking chart because why not.  Much of the protest literature consists of refining, arguing about, and introducing complications to these sorts of views. You can just check the Google Scholar list of the 800+ books and articles citing Lipsky to get an idea of where things have gone.

But look at that, Earl Cook looks at energy consumption of different sectors of society in Man, Energy, and Society. Cook's work is discussed in Ian Morris's The Measure of Civilization, but basically both are getting at the calories expended on Home/Commerce, Agriculture/Industry, and Transportation. I haven't looked closely at Cook's text, but it might give some ideas of how to break them down for the purposes of what you're looking at (food, clothing and shelter).  But it is a backwards kind of approach. These are energy expenditures, which doesn't just come from ""work"" so to speak.

AskSocialScience,345hcf,AtomicKoala,8,Tue Apr 28 13:36:30 2015 UTC,"I can speak a bit about corruption in the setting of principal-agent literature.  The framework considered is that of a regulatory agency (""Principal"") and a regulated firm (""agent"") with a third party employed to audit the agent.  The big example that comes to mind is the bond rating agencies that were colluding with the insurers/banks before the financial collapse in 2009.  The principal-agent literature in economics has considered quite a bit about optimal corruption.  The general view is that there is a marginal benefit and a marginal cost of deterring corruption.  The marginal cost is the mechanism needed to prevent and enforce no corruption.    To understand this, imagine we impose a fine of $500 on businesses for not keeping their kitchens clean.  It would certainly raise the prospect of bribing the inspector.  However, the concern may not be as big as thought - a kitchen that wants to bribe rather than clean would need to pay upwards of $500, and so there is still a deterrence effect.  In other words, even when corruption is an issue, deterrence is still present.    On the other hand, extortion may cause problems.  An inspector may extort up to $500 from a kitchen that is clean.  This would be a problem because it would reduce deterrence.    So to get inspectors to not extort, the simple solution is to reward kitchens for reporting corruption.  This prevents extortion and allows for bribes which do deter.

Fairness becomes a bit less important as they get more life experience as they see how life is really unfair. Harm gets a bit less important, because they have experienced more pain and know humans can deal with quite some harm. Authority gets more important as they personally get more authority as they age.  And so on.

Its population bottomed out in the 1980s from a steep decline that started in the 1950s, altho East Asian and counterculture (gays, hippies, beatniks) immigration stemmed much of the tide.  SF never abandoned its downtown and its transit networks, however--the city was too small physically to have more than one major node.  It was always a premiere office market, a wave of office towers probably brought on by BART in a variety of industries, namely financial in the 1980s turned things around, then tech in the 1990s and today.  Unfortunately, the middle class and black populations have been rapidly disappearing since the bottoming out.    I know less of Pittsburgh, but that's a city that did absolutely well to transition from steel into an academic knowledge economy.

I have a theory that the advent of the condo in the 1970s, which allowed multiple home ownership in the same building outside of co-ops helped, as did local revitalization efforts.

AskSocialScience,342xlf,watafuru,4,Mon Apr 27 21:59:20 2015 UTC,"Your question specifies that ""everyone would have the luxuries of the American middle class"". So, for example, everyone will have cars like the average American does now. In 2014, the U.S. bought 18% of the 85m cars produced. The U.S. has only 5% of the global population, so to produce the same number of cars for the rest of the world, auto production will need to be four times its current level.  The Gross World Product is a sum of all of the things humans currently produce in a year. In 2013, it was estimated to be US$87 trillion. In 2014, the U.S. spent about $1 trillion on the auto industry, so global auto production will rise from about $5 trillion to about $20 trillion.  It is possible that we could shift 20% of global production toward making cars, but it would be incredibly difficult repurposing factories, retraining workers, etc. It is not possible that we could simultaneously make the similar expansions in every industry.  Economics is the study of allocation of scarce resources. Most economies use price-based allocation: people choose what to produce based on what they are paid most for and choose what to consume based on what value they can get most cheaply. Some use command-based allocation: the government determines what people need and what they deserve.  We can choose who gets what. But increasing how much everyone gets in total is a difficult process of developing scientific understanding, educating people, and building infrastructure. We cannot do so by fiat, regardless of the number we print on people's paychecks."

Average constant dollar income in China today is about the same as average income in the US in 1975, average income in China in 1975 was about the same as the average income in the US in 1820; the gap is closing quickly. The last ~generation has seen a remarkable decline in worldwide inequality,   Instead of thinking of income/wealth as a pie think of it as a balloon of infinite possible size, the size of the balloon is a function of total income rather then incomes being a function of the balloons size. Aggregate income is simply the sum of all incomes not a fixed pie that people take slices from.  If this somehow happened tomorrow the environmental ramifications would be pretty devastating though. China have already encountered significant constraints on using non-fossil generation which is why they are building so many coal plants, if the entire world attempted to reach 10mWh PC at the same time we would instantly devastate the planet. Over the longer term (realistic scenario) the effects largely depend on how effective non-fossil generation becomes and how significant the constraints on utilizing those resources are.  A couple of other environmental issues to consider;   Even assuming developing countries only increase beef to the lower bounds of the advanced nation range this still implies more then a doubling of global beef production. Livestock is extremely resource intensive and a significant contributor to climate change (more so then even car usage). While demand for some resources falls with development (notably wood) others increase substantially (notably plastics & metals), the effects of additional mining/refining/etc would be substantial. How problematic this is largely depends on a mixture of policy (its possible to mine and have a neutral environmental impact, most countries don't) and how effective emerging technologies (EG plastics from plant matter) are.   Some human capital constraints also exist. A problem that we already have today in advanced countries is that we don't train a sufficient number of physicians, there are various constraints on the number we can train each year (political in funding for residency, behavioral in people not wanting to complete the hellish education, training & certification process), and this doesn't even account for increasing physician demand in developing countries. Another good example of this is China's electricity generation, one of the constraints they have encountered in deploying nuclear is their ability to attract & train nuclear engineers & operators. This effect is exacerbated by institutional effects, to reach the same quality of education as advanced countries takes an extremely long time so you can encounter worldwide skill supply shortage problems that take an extremely long time to clear.

Said another way, if rich people did commit as much crime as poor people, how would we even know?"
AskSocialScience,340rsu,playingdecoy,22,Mon Apr 27 19:23:58 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Critical criminologists have pointed out that criminology has long tended to ""study down"" and focus on the ""street crimes"" of economically underprivileged groups while ignoring the crimes of the elite (individuals and organizations). This is, in part, because criminologists have tended to allow our research agenda to be set by the government, from whom we receive grant money to do our research, and the government has not tended to be in the business of criminalizing the political, social, and economic elite. ""Crime,"" at least in the US, has tended to mean ""street crime,"" not ""suite crime.""  In 1939, Edwin Sutherland addressed the American Sociological Association and introduced a theory of white-collar offending and argued that criminologists shouldn't limit themselves to only studying ""street crimes"" or adhering to the definition of ""crime"" as set by criminal law, which is inherently class-biased (think about who gets to make the law, who has the power to influence the law-making process, etc). He argued that differential application of the law (basically, that elite people and corporations were not subject to criminal penalties for harmful acts) eliminated or at least reduced the stigma of crime for these offenders.    ""The criminal statistics show unequivocally that crime, as popularly conceived and officially measured, has a high incidence in the lower class and a low incidence in the upper class; less than two percent of the persons committed to prisons in a year belong to the upper class. These statistics refer to criminals handled by the police, the criminal and juvenile courts, and the prisons, and to such crimes as murder, assault, burglary, robbery, larcency, sex offenses, and drunkenness, but exclude traffic violations. The criminologists have used the case histories and criminal statistics derived from these agencies of criminal justice as their principal data. From them, they have derived general theories of criminal behavior. These theories are that, since crime is concentrated in the lower class, it is caused by poverty or by personal and social characteristics believed to be associated statistically with poverty, including feeblemindedness, psychopathic deviations, slum neighborhoods, and ""deteriorated"" families.""   The full text of his address is here.  So here, he is saying that yes, all of our criminal statistics show high rates of crime among the poor and low rates among the wealthy. Criminologists (he accuses) had been uncritically accepting these statistics and using them to fashion all sorts of theories about the causes of crime that basically focused on the pathology of poverty. What he goes on to say in the paper is that these theories do a poor job of explaining an understudied type of crime, the crimes of the affluent, frequently committed in the course of their professional duties (and thus tending to have a larger reach and more widespread harm than interpersonal street crimes).  So, as you say, back in 1939 Sutherland was already pointing out that white-collar criminals were going undetected and unpunished. When they were detected, they were able to evade criminal punishment by having good legal representation and paying fines or other settlements. Criminology didn't really cotton on to all of this until the rise of critical criminology in the 60s, and we're still trying to do more research on the topic - it's a real struggle, because while we have mountains and mountains of crime stats and shovel-ready data on street crimes, we have almost no databases of white-collar, corporate, and environmental crimes, which makes it really hard to do the research.

Hrrrm, what to recommend... Try starting here - the article isn't paywalled, it's by some top criminologists, and the lit review will be really useful for you (as well as their analysis):  Piquero, A. R., & Brame, R. W. (2008).

Sorry if I misunderstood. Intersectionality (moving away from looking at just race or just gender or just class and toward more consideration of how these identities interact) has largely been pushed forward by feminist criminologists, so a lot of the research has concerned women and crime, like issues of intimate partner violence, women offenders and reentry, etc.  So you have issues of race (institutionalized racism which can lead to overpolicing, worse outcomes in CJ system, but also worse education and employment outcomes), social class (poor education and employment outcomes, also more likely to be overpoliced, also more likely to commit crimes of frustration or need), AND gender (masculinity and what young men feel they need to do to prove their masculinity, the disproportionate involvement of males in criminal offending). That's a tangled web - it would be difficult to isolate any of those factors, and you would probably need to survey or interview people directly, because relying on any official stats would introduce all of the bias in the CJ system back into your data.  Here's an interesting study on youth offenders, race, and social class that actually finds a more pronounced effect for race at higher income levels, which the author argues supports this ""out of place"" hypothesis (law as social control)."

The theory behind why this happens suggests that as people's relative position in society changes, there is an increased incentive for the disadvantaged to make up for lost ground by engaging in criminal activities. What's more, it isn't unlikely that the presence of positive images associated to wealth (which are increasingly common), combined with the disparity of poverty, makes people perceive the benefits of crime as being far above the potential costs, which would further suggest that the underclass are more criminally inclined.  This isn't to say that the underclass are inherently criminals or should always be perceived as such, because frankly, this is merely allowing the cycle of poverty and crime to continue. The best approach is to take it easy on the disadvantaged and the poor, and to provide more opportunities for them besides crime, especially opportunities that help them improve their socioeconomic status. My macro professor this past term went so far as to suggest that reinstating child labour laws in underdeveloped countries might be a good idea when paired with education programs, as it keeps young people off the streets, making money, and earning an education, a win-win.

LaCour did not vary allowing the respondent to voice their opinion and then see if those that did were more persuadable.  In fact, both the gay and non-gay canvassers allowed the respondent to voice their opinion, but only the gay canvassers made lasting change. Therefore, it is clear that voicing ones opinion certainly isn't enough by itself to make one persuadable.  Here is the quote from the actual paper:   The same-sex marriage script invited voters to share their experiences with marriage. This script was the same for gay and straight canvassers, with one important exception. After establishing rapport with the voter, midway through the conversation gay canvassers revealed that they are gay or lesbian and that they would like to get married but that the law prohibits same-sex marriage. Straight canvassers instead described how their child, friend, or relative would like to get married but that the law prohibits same-sex marriage.

AskSocialScience,33v05d,Thorston,10,Sun Apr 26 03:16:46 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. A couple of other factors as well, one pro and one con:   Studies have actually shown that when exposed with a false conception, even if the myth is immediately contextualized and its falsehood revealed, people retain the original myth. Hence we now have health organizations urging that people not reprint anti-vax myths, but focus on the health benefits of vaccines. Many easily discreditable Creationist arguments, for another example, proliferate because they're constantly brought up in the mainstream under the guise of debate. I can't imagine that letting Neo-Nazis and Red-Pillers onto chat shows would result in a reduction of their worldview. I wonder if criminalizing certain expression (which I'm not in favor of except in few, well-defined cases generally involving slander/libel or harassing people with threats that already exist) has the effect of driving it completely into the underground, where many people who haven't been exposed to it before don't have the experience to deal with it. You might end up with a phenomenon akin to that where some sheltered children end up going off the deep end as soon as they leave home because they're exposed to this whole new world, some of it damaging, which they are entirely unprepared for. Whereas if the belief is legal but viewed as reprehensible, people might be exposed to it in some form almost as an inoculation.   In the context of preventing hate crimes, it's an interesting academic discussion to be sure, though obviously as individuals the way we approach it might have more to do with ""Am I indirectly perpetuating a narrative which might harm others down the road by letting this bigot go by unchecked?""

He addresses the matter of free speech in Anti-Semite and Jew. He describes the anti-Semite (or bigots in general) as someone who takes on unreasonable opinions because they have chosen to be unreasonable, not because they are uninformed. I think it makes sense -- bigotry is so clearly unwarranted that no person who was susceptible to reason anyways would go along with it. Moreover, anti-Semitism (again, this extends to bigotry in general) is less a particular opinion that can be mixed and matched with other facets of a personality without changing the rest, but a passion that is symptomatic of a particular type of personality,   Essentially, he describes bigotry as less a matter of misinformation than it is about the material conditions under which people live. Allowing free speech and open debate wouldn't do much to change the minds of serious bigots (who typically engage in debate for amusement or to win converts), but it would make it easier for them to find each other and organize to do bad things."
AskSocialScience,33v05d,GreenMethods,6,Sun Apr 26 23:55:14 2015 UTC,"I'm skeptical of this viewpoint for two reasons.  First, I don't think people are really as open to debate as Mill thinks. People tend to be more subject to their biases and ideologies than reason, and you can throw as much as logical argument at some people and they still won't budge, because the benefits to accepting a new viewpoint don't exceed the perceived costs.  Second, there is a certain objectivity to truth in many circumstances that follows from biases which makes it difficult to argue things based on ethics. For example, the definition of ""when life begins"" is more or less arbitrary, and based on how one defines that limit, one takes either a pro-abortion or anti-abortion stance. Two people on opposing sides could argue back and forth about the issue, and you could get neither of them budging on the definition of ""when life begins"" based on their biases, which again, are hard to overcome."

AskSocialScience,33w5ta,pchancharl,7,Sun Apr 26 05:08:25 2015 UTC,"The country with the highest GDP has the highest ROI for capital (correct me if I'm wrong)   This is incorrect. There is actually a negative correlation between growth and equity returns.  A higher GDP may imply that capital EVA is higher but these are returns to the whole economy not just capital. In the US capital share has actually been unusually stable for the last ~30 years, there was a slight increase 2000-2008 which has since fallen, capital shares 2011, 2001, 1991 and 1981 were all nearly identical.   so people with money to invest will cause countries to compete for this capital by creating economic and social policies that increase GDP the most all other things equal.   Capital is not zero-sum. Certainly countries tend to promote policies that result in capital formation but its not really useful to think about it in terms of an absolute amount of capital available in the world and countries competing for parts of the pie, most capital is in the form of credit which is simply created on demand.   So, for example, one ugly sweater and one beautiful sweater might be priced different because of the artistry of one over the other   The difference in value is simply marginalism in practice.   but they are composed of the same amount of wool and service labor (payable in food to the workers)   This is very close to the labor theory of value which marginalism replaced a century and a half ago, its not particularly useful to consider pricing of goods in terms of the resource costs to produce those goods in most circumstances. Simple example; Google spends a vast amount of human capital to produce Chrome, why is it free?   With this background in mind, we can reasonable assume that ever increasing GDP must at some point hit the boundary limits of what it is feasible to extract from the environment.    This assumes a direct and proportional relationship between growth and resources which does not exist, the economic value of resources is not fixed which is why the 2nd law imposes constraints on the rate of growth not growth itself.  Simple example is electricity. A century ago our returns from electricity generation peaked with the light bulb, then came the refrigerator and then the computer. Did the economic value of a kwh of electricity increase, decrease  or stay the same across the last century?  Another good example is wood products. In advanced economies demand for final wood products continues to increase but the utilization of wood resources is falling. We make more effective use of wood resources.   People today can have cell phones cheaply, but fresh food and clean water and air are expensive.   Food has never been cheaper and continues to get cheaper. At the household level the only expense that is falling faster is transport.  Water is another area where continued production improvements are reducing cost, Saudi is in the process of building a desalination plant which produces potable water at around the same cost as waste water treatment.  Over the last 30 years the broad basket that constitutes basic cost of living (housing, utilities, groceries etc) has fallen in real terms nearly every year, even if income over that period had remained real flat every year the cost of continued existence relative to income would have fallen. Even with costs which are rising (such as housing) often these can be attributed to consumption changes, in the housing example while cost per ft2 has a great deal of variance over time the growth trend is much more modest then household spending on housing suggests; the increase in housing costs are mostly the result of people living in larger homes and household sizes falling.   As many movies as they can watch, but access to medical and academic facilities (which require high service costs = high goods costs) are lacking.   You would be hard pressed to actually demonstrate medical accessibility has fallen even if you just confine it to the US; consumption has pretty dramatically risen over the last generation. Almost all the rise in health costs is attributable to technology, we have a ~20-30% premium due to inefficiencies in our payment & delivery system but why would that imply a reduction in accessibility particularly when these are not out of pocket costs?  Similarly we have one of the highest tertiary enrollment rates in the world and the college premium continues to increase, the way student loans function generally prevents a credit constraint on education.   However, with technology I see three issues. One, the increase in consumption of physical materials is expanding at a faster rate than the increase of technology to counteract the damage that this is causing   Carrying capacity is increasing faster then population, carrying capacity today is about three times expected peak world population.   Finally, and most importantly, there are many technologies that are grossly environmentally harmful and increase physical material consumption and there is no guarantee that such technology will not be used to a greater extent (in terms of environmental degradation) as technology used to increase our material stock. We have both fracking and plastic bag production as well as recycling and solar panels for example.   Externalities are fairly easy to manage, that we don't do so is mostly political constraints (notably the politicians are idiots constraint).  Also its important to consider where the constraints are when considering the long-run environmental effects of development. A good example here is China and their coal power plants. China are deploying coal plants because there are human capital and resource constraints which prevent them from deploying nuclear at a pace to meet electricity demand, eventually those constraints will resolve and they will replace coal with nuclear (or other) generation.   I think this failure of capitalism is in itself driving a lot of the unemployment that we see as well. Automated check outs and teller machines cost less in variable physical material than an actual person. The food and land rent that a physical person requires to survive is too high for a company to pay compared to the electricity cost that a machine consumes. Interestingly, since there is no, or little, artistic utility competition for such goods between firms the desire to reduce the physical goods cost is the only concern of any grocery store or bank and so jobs are eliminated. We see this with many manufactured staples as well, where the artistic utility is negligible, and so the only necessity is limiting physical materials cost. Electronic goods made increasingly of plastics and produced in foreign countries with low service costs, or many of the goods produced at Walmart or other big box retailers for example.   Automation does not long-run result in unemployment (ceteris paribus), it acts as a productivity multiplier on human labor which increases labor demand. Automation disrupts labor rather then displaces labor, demand for some skills fall while others climb. How much structural unemployment results depends on how effective education is, how much HCD businesses do etc."

Several arguments fly in the face of obvious evidence and so I'm suspect of much of what you have to say. I don't know if I can address everything, but here are a couple problems I see.   Automation does not long-run result in unemployment.   Citation needed. We have seen efficiency in production increase over the last 30 years and median wages have actually fallen in real terms. Maybe TECHNICALLY unemployment is more or less constant if we examine the rise in low level service jobs that cannot yet be automated away, the decrease in the labor force from demographics and labor force exit, and the rise of zero-call and 'uber-esque' on demand employment. But the idea that automation/technology leads to a rise in demand for labor would assume that greater capital efficiency increases the total production stock rather than offsets the labor portion of existing labor, which very much doesn't seem to be the case, at least not always.   Externalities are fairly easy to manage, that we don't do so is mostly political constraints   This is just thrown out there with no evidence or explanation whatsoever as if this were obvious. All of the eastern seaboard in China is a polluted hellscape due to the export of air pollution in order to increase consumption. If it's a 'political' problem then it is not an easy one to solve or a billion people would not be suffering. I find the distinction between politics and economics to be misleading and unhelpful as one informs the other and vice versa, and the claim they don't is naive.   Carrying capacity is increasing faster then population   There is a difference in ""carry capacity"" (ie the absolute maximum number of people the world can sustain at any quality of life) and the actual quality of life people have right now. Also, I don't believe this is actually true without a citation. We have many problems right now that involve processes that are ""black swans"" or extralinear disastrous effects. For example, if the sea temperature rises enough to melt frozen methane in the arctic world temperatures could rise catastrophically and very very suddenly. Much of these catastrophic increases in environmental damage are unknown (how many species must die in an eco system before diversity collapse? How much coral reef needs to be killed by acid before fisheries world wide no longer can get fish?). Citation very much needed.   You would be hard pressed to actually demonstrate medical accessibility has fallen even if you just confine it to the US   No I wouldn't. Medical spending as a proportion of GDP in the US is higher (by a lot) when compared to countries that have the same demographic population than the US and better health outcomes (Europe). Wrong.   Food has never been cheaper and continues to get cheaper.   Citation needed. The composition of food has CHANGED and changed in ways that are not actually obvious. This is a hard one for most people to wrap their heads around. Take peanut butter. The cost of peanut butter may be lower, but the cost of peanut butter MADE FROM 100% PEANUTS is dramatically higher. Artificial peanut butter made from hydrogenated soybean oil is probably much cheaper, but also extremely bad for your health. However, if you look at a CPI table, they are probably listed as the same thing! The same thing happens with the distinction between GMO and non-organic apples and fresh apples and so on. I'm also not at all sure that fresh food will continue to get cheaper. The California water crisis is a huge issue, since 25% of US fruits/vegs were grown there, and the crisis was caused by water mismanagement and climate change. Half of all land and water in China is no longer arable or palatable for consumption. Fishery populations are down worldwide. It seems difficult to forecast an increase in production of food into the future given that environmental damage is so high.   Over the last 30 years the broad basket that constitutes basic cost of living (housing, utilities, groceries etc) has fallen    Given what I have said about food I am skeptical of the methodology used to constitute your basket. It's almost a canard to say that the quality of goods has declined over the last 30 years. While we have more things, and more artistic things, their physical structure is more often made of plastics than metals and do not last as long as we try and find more and cheaper ways to make products with fewer physical goods made in countries with lower standards of living (lower labor/goods cost).  Last critique as I am getting tired.   There is actually a negative correlation between growth and equity returns.   The last sentence of the abstract is: ""Apparently investors overpay for expected growth, and this overpayment more than offsets the  benefits of unexpected growth."" Which means investors ARE chasing GDP growth and competing for it. Which was my point.   Last, last critique.   In the US capital share has actually been unusually stable for the last ~30 years, there was a slight increase 2000-2008 which has since fallen, capital shares 2011, 2001, 1991 and 1981 were all nearly identical.

Meaning the same worker, at the same real adjusted salary, is producing more goods.This also means, over time, that labor is reaping a declining percentage in the gains of production over time for the same level of input. There are many reasons why capital might be constant (gains in technology, over competition for labor in the third world, etc)."
AskSocialScience,33w5ta,HealthcareEconomist3,3,Mon Apr 27 00:07:45 2015 UTC,"median wages have actually fallen in real terms.    This is a fairly prevalent, but wrong, myth. Median household income stagnated due to a demographic change in households (getting smaller and younger), this has been discussed by CB since the 70's yet this persists.  The hourly wage ""stagnation"" is also misrepresented on a number of points;   Often it uses the BLS wage data, which excludes salaried (and also hourly supervisory workers typically), BLS have a different measure called earnings which measures all regular income but lobby group/media analysis always seems to ignore this. Also it excludes non-regular income, for service workers who receive tips this is obviously problematic. Usually CPS is quoted even though its known to have an extremely large bias effect, we ask people five questions to understand how much they earn with an explicit statement to estimate. We have numbers problems with the way we measure inflation (CPI); we exclude rural consumers entirely, its based on CPS so has the same bias effects and it overestimates the effect of inflation on low-income workers while underestimating it on high-income earners.   There is a good discussion of these issues here.   But the idea that automation/technology leads to a rise in demand for labor would assume that greater capital efficiency increases the total production stock rather than offsets the labor portion of existing labor, which very much doesn't seem to be the case, at least not always.   Its a simple productivity effect, automation increases the productive efficiency of labor.  Autor has a good discussion of automation here.   This is just thrown out there with no evidence or explanation whatsoever as if this were obvious.   Pigovian taxes.   All of the eastern seaboard in China is a polluted hellscape due to the export of air pollution in order to increase consumption.   Somewhat related to the later point regarding constraints they are encountering deploying nuclear generation. Side question, would they have have faced the same constraints if advanced economies had continued to deploy nuclear generation beyond the 70's?  Also related to the p-taxes the US is in a particularly unique position where a well designed carbon tax imposed in concert with the EU would force every other country in the world to do the same thing.   I find the distinction between politics and economics to be misleading and unhelpful as one informs the other and vice versa, and the claim they don't is naive.   Politics does not inform economics, we abandoned that insane bias decades ago. Economics relies on politics to surface policy but that is not particularly effective. Also for the ideological bias next question see this.   Also, I don't believe this is actually true without a citation.   Good discussion of the issues here. Generally models will significantly underestimate future carrying capacity as its impossible to account for future water & food productivity, as a good example vertical farms and GMO could replace our need for arable land which would remove food constraints. Likewise water projections ignore that we are on the verge of producing potable water using renewable energy for the same cost we currently treat waste water with.  The ~3 times is based on applying an exponential productivity rather then linear productivity function to the Condorcet model, this assumes the rate of development in the future is the same as the rate of development in the past (itself an underestimate). I would argue that carrying capacity either already is or is approaching an absurdly high number which might as well be ∞, environmental constraints are largely political constraints (again, politicians are idiots and don't support good policy) not real constraints and we don't have real resource constraints unless we are discussing many hundreds of times our current population.   Medical spending as a proportion of GDP in the US is higher (by a lot)    Why does this imply reduced accessibility given health consumers are not exposed to prices?   when compared to countries that have the same demographic population than the US and better health outcomes (Europe)   Europe doesn't have better health outcomes then the US, also I am not sure taking the aggregate of Europe given the massive variance in health system designs and outcomes is particularly useful.    Citation needed.   http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=19gc discussion of household spending here. Also you can grab the CPS data here to examine cost trends yourself. This effect also biases for poorer households (IE, they have seen a larger reduction in basic expenses).  Also a good indirect way of looking at this is PCE for luxury goods and discretionary incomes.   The composition of food has CHANGED and changed in ways that are not actually obvious. This is a hard one for most people to wrap their heads around. Take peanut butter. The cost of peanut butter may be lower, but the cost of peanut butter MADE FROM 100% PEANUTS is dramatically higher.   Does the new composition reduce utility?   And yet, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce_productivity[1] shows workforce productivity has continued to skyrocket. Meaning the same worker, at the same real adjusted salary, is producing more goods.This also means, over time, that labor is reaping a declining percentage in the gains of production over time for the same level of input.    This is incorrect. See this, this and this.   There are many reasons why capital might be constant (gains in technology, over competition for labor in the third world, etc).   Labor/capital share is zero-sum as it represents shares of output."

AskSocialScience,33w5ta,commentsrus,0,Mon Apr 27 02:59:00 2015 UTC,"Here is the abstract from the Robert Gordon paper you cited:   Misperceptions About the Magnitude and Timing of Changes in American Income Inequality  The rise in American inequality has been exaggerated both in magnitude and timing. Commentators lament the large gap between the growth rates of real median household income and of private sector productivity. This paper shows that a conceptually consistent measure of this growth gap over 1979 to 2007 is only one-tenth of the conventional measure. Further, the timing of the rise of inequality is often misunderstood. By some measures inequality stopped growing after 2000 and by others inequality has not grown since 1993. This cessation of inequality’s secular rise in 2000 is evident from the growth of Census mean vs. median income, and in the income share of the top one percent of the income distribution. The income share of the 91st to 95th percentile has not increased since 1983, and the income ratio of the 90th to 10th percentile has barely increased since 1986. Further, despite a transient decline in labor’s income share in 2000-06, by mid-2009 labor’s share had returned virtually to the same value as in 1983, 1991, and 2001. Recent contributions in the inequality literature have raised questions about previous research on skill-biased technical change and the managerial power of CEOs. Directly supporting our theme of prior exaggeration of the rise of inequality is new research showing that price indexes for the poor rise more slowly than for the rich, causing most empirical measures of inequality to overstate the growth of real income of the rich vs. the poor. Further, as much as two-thirds of the post-1980 increase in the college wage premium disappears when allowance is made for the faster rise in the cost of living in cities where the college educated congregate and for the lower quality of housing in those cities. A continuing tendency for life expectancy to increase faster among the rich than among the poor reflects the joint impact of education on both economic and health outcomes, some of which are driven by the behavioral choices of the less educated.  I simply do not believe that this paper isn't against the concensus of what most economists  believe today. I skimmed your papers, saw that you included this, and stopped reading. And no, despite your condesension, the sum total of my knowledge about inequality is not from wikipedia. It was an example of many different sources contradicting the one you had shown me, thus leading me to doubt its veracity. The well is poisoned here - you are very clearly well read in the academic literature, but I no longer believe that anything you tell me isn't politically apologetic and biased.

By that, I mean the authoritarian anti-immigration parties tend to have left-wing economic views (more closed markets) while the pro-market parties tend to be more libertarian and pro-immigration. So they're right-wing on one spectrum but left wing on another.  Although, that is less conservative parties being pro immigration. Rather, it's just looking at politics as both an up-down spectrum AND a left-right spectrum for economic and social issues separately (basically, a four-quadrant grid instead of a line). Vlad Putin is a good example here of a ""left authoritarian""--he is left-wing on economic issues (relatively) but certainly quite nationalistic and closed borders, while his opposition is the opposite.  Finding a party that is both socially conservative AND more free-market oriented (Tories, Republicans) that are also more pro-immigration than their counterparts is a more difficult task."

Also although Germany and the UK are favored countries for immigrants  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Migration_and_migrant_population_statistics  those coutries have a lower fertility rate http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Total_fertility_rate,_1960%E2%80%932012_%28live_births_per_woman%29_YB14.png so I don't think there is a link between immigration and higher fertility rates than other countries in western europe.

A ""civil society"" isn't any individual organization - it collectively refers to all non-government, non-commercial citizen groups. So Human Rights Watch is part of civil society, but so is your local church, the Ku Klux Klan, and a high school chess club.  Think of civil society groups like unions, but for citizens - they allow people to organize, collectivize their voices, and put pressure on an otherwise unresponsive government (or business, or whatever else). Because a just, accountable, and transparent government is something the citizens usually want a lot more than the government does, it's not likely to exist where there isn't civil society to advocate for it. For that reason, aspects of civil society are often targeted by the government when it's moving away from accountability.  It's pretty widely accepted among political scientists that civil society has a positive affect on good government. The right of a high school chess club to exist doesn't seem like it affects democracy one way or the other, of course. But it builds trust and cohesion among citizens, which is vital as a counterweight to the government's natural power. And the idea is that if a free, vibrant, and uncensored civil society exists, then citizens will be as able to organize to play chess after school as they are to join a group lobbying for the release of political prisoners or protecting a local forest from being bulldozed. There's no shortage of scholarship emphasizing these points - I mean, that's essentially what Alexis de Tocqueville was describing in Democracy in America."

The idea of loss aversion is that, no matter how small the stakes are, a loss is still worse than an equivalent gain is good. Imagine that the $100 shrinks to $1. At that point, $1 here or there isn't going to change my grocery purchases. But, if I'm loss averse, I dislike that $1 loss more than I would like a $1 gain. If you're familiar with calculus, then under loss aversion, the derivative of the utility function (i.e., the marginal utility function) is undefined at 0, because it is some amount coming from the gain side, and C times that amount on the loss side. Under standard theory, when we're thinking about infinitesimal changes in either direction, the utility difference should be the same. So loss aversion does indeed provide something different.  This ends up being important because observed risk aversion over small stakes (say, rejecting a 50/50 gamble where you could win $11 or lose $10, which has been observed in the lab) implies implausible risk aversion over larger stakes under the standard model of risk aversion. That's the implication of Rabin's Calibration Theorem. Good discussion by Kevin Bryan about the paper here.  EDIT: It's not like this stuff is irreconciliable with economics.

The impact is that the issue must be resolved by state courts. There is a history of jurisdiction stripping, and threats of jurisdiction stripping, in the past several decades. I will look for the paper to cite you; for now, I recall that after J.

AskSocialScience,33lj9d,thesweetestpunch,6,Fri Apr 24 12:09:01 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate why you hypothesize that lower feelings of racial threat would lead to less federal government spending? I can't intuit what you're implying.
AskSocialScience,33lj9d,elgreko,8,Thu Apr 23 15:44:37 2015 UTC,There's a lot of literature showing that diversity is negatively related to public spending. Example here.
AskSocialScience,33lj9d,guga31bb,7,Thu Apr 23 16:38:46 2015 UTC,"Some studies (starting with Key 1949) suggest that social resources are restricted in places with large minority populations - which has been called the racial threat hypothesis. Others have found public spending is restricted in large minority populations and link this phenomenon to racial threat. I find that the federal government invests less money in places with upwardly mobile minority populations net of racial composition. So, in my discussion, I say that this may perhaps be linked to racial threat, but there is little research into the link between minority upward mobility and whites' perceptions of racial threat."
AskSocialScience,33lj9d,elgreko,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:05:15 2015 UTC,"So your hypothesis is something like higher minority upward mobility (x) --> greater racial threat (y) --> lesser federal spending (z). You know that x --> z and y --> z empirically, so you’re looking for literature subsantiating x --> y. I assume that greater upward mobility means wealther than-average minorities in a community? I think I understand now.  When you examine the fact that higher minority upward mobility → lesser federal spending, see if the relative concentration of minorities could be a confounding factor. That is, try to control for the proportion of the population that is minority. It may be that greater minority concentration and greater upward mobility are strongly tied, and the former variable is what is really driving the greater racial threat. This is an intuition based on the fact that wealthy minorities tend to be nearly as segregated as poor ones. Here is a recent study I found on segregation patterns."

Clarification can be offered but when you pick and choose the datasets to carve out that political statement from the facts its all you.  Can we assume the question is specific to the United States (""whites"" could also be taken as the rich, educated elite, think Asia and their full body swimsuits (which is actually a minority but I digress)) and your usage of Federal Gov.    Keep in mind some states get more money from the federal government than they give (those pesky red states) which is going to blur your data set.  Once you focus on the states which take the larger portions of cash you can also show measurable correlation to reduced levels of education and increased levels of religion in those red states which is a prime indicator of poverty.  Additionally, there is a clear link between poverty and corruption.  An overgeneralized description would present that instead of an educated democratic process deciding on lawmakers you get a manipulative ruling class running the show in these states.  My understanding is that the federal government writes that check to the state it gets distributed down from the state capitol.  That is really where an honest investigation would begin.  But if you want to make race the focus of the conversation stay away from there, that will clearly bring up poverty which correctly makes it a class conversation instead of a race conversation.  Instead, I suggest keeping the topic on what the ""whites"" have and the ""minorities"" do not.  Cherry pick the richest Whitest states and compare them to the poorest minority states.

There are just too many avenues to explore this adequately, and I hope you can appreciate that my answer may seem somewhat incomplete and Western-centric.   I'm going to say that one thing you must consider is the social mobility of men and women in comparison to each other. Do men typically marry 'up' to a woman, or 'down'? That is, do men marry women of higher or lower class status than themselves? We need to cover this, because those who are 'upwardly mobile' (marry into a higher class) are generally understood to be more likely to adopt the political tendencies of their spouse, while those who are 'downwardly mobile' hold on to their political views (Weakliem, 1992).  This is where I'm going out on a limb slightly, but I would say that it is usually women who are the upwardly mobile actor in a marriage, based on bits and bobs of evidence (Edlund, 1999, p. 1296; Pedraza, 1991, 315) and the universal subordination of women, with women's roles typically restricted to the home (Ortner, 1974), and men expected to 'make themselves' in the outside world .  Therefore, I would suggest (with caution) that women would tend to be more likely to adhere to the political tendencies of their husbands. But please, please, please take this with a pinch of salt as this is likely to vary dramatically from culture to culture, as political systems change, marriage systems change, and gender relations vary in their cultural expression.

While I don't have the answer you're looking for, I'd like to challenge the premise of your question with some friendly food for thought.   From a social science perspective, our general point of departure will generally be that economic or social factors influence everything and can help to explain patterns and trends. Even down the the interpersonal. For example, say a child is abused by her parents. This is a personal choice by her parents, but increases in domestic violence correlate strongly with increased macroeconomic troubles. Here's an article about this that is extensively sourced.  Back to Suicide. The act of someone deciding to take his or her own life is always related to something. The person feels helpless or alone, or without any other options, or maybe something else. Be it personal or external, the decision comes from somewhere, for some reason. Some questions to think about:   What are the factors that put the person in a situation where suicide was the answer? Is it entirely (inter)personal or are there economic or societal factors that are a part of it? Are there economic or societal factors that are influencing (inter)personal choices? Psychology Today seems to have some opinions on these kinds of questions that might be worth a look.  And for the subset of people who commit suicide as a result of mental illness, how stable or unstable are reported rates of individuals seeking help for a mental illness? Are there any economic or societal factors that correlate with these rates?  Finally, can we ask same kind of question about other types of personal decisions? Like the birth rate for example? Here's a look at external factors that seem to have lead to baby booms."

Further, in both North and South Italy, many young people take odd jobs that are paid entirely in cash; so for the state, they are in all effect unemployed and pay no taxes, even if they are doing some kind of work (Italian article citing ISTAT estimates that say ""Black-Market"", or unregistered cash-only work, could be as high as 21% of GDP). There is also a very serious crime problem in Southern Italy, both in a sense of organized crime and petty crime.

Many other recent studies, ranging from researches in New Zealand to Rutgers University in New Jersey working on behalf of the state Justice Department to the World Bank link crime levels to unemployment.   Although the presence of organized crime organizations, including but not limited to the Mafia, is not limited to Southern Italy, their presence in the North is mostly limited to corruption of entities of state in order allow their controlled front companies to obtain public works contracts (TAV, MOSE, an Expo are recent high-profile examples).

The report is a decade old, but the concepts outlined aren't any less valid.   In a broad sense, perhaps. But the years since past then have been extremely valuable in eradicating many branches and instruments of organized crime especially in the South, so I'm fairly sure any number contained there would be outdated to the point of uselessness by now. Certainly unemployment can favour crime proliferation, but there are a myriad of additional factors involved that quite simply can't be ignored for the sake of proving a specific point. Quite notably, organized crime, especially of the age-old, traditionalistic kind such as Cosa Nostra, is quite a different concept than petty crime that's simply due to the lack of other means of sustenance: I very seriously doubt that the operation of such organizations can be closely related to unemployment rates in any way, shape or form.   In the South, criminal organizations are completely ingrained in the ""Social Texture, (it. ""Tessuto Sociale""), in great part thanks to the lack of economic development, as explained by this report by the Italian Ministry of the Interior.   Again, this is a situation that has been changing ragingly during the past few years, with more and more people refusing to give in and forming or supporting public groups against the phenomena. It may still be true to some extent that organized crime is ""ingrained in the social texture"" (however nebulous this terminology may be), but I, again, reject your initial claim that this may have anything to do with unemployment rates.  You mentioned yourself that much of the work done in the South is done off the books, thus officially figuring as unemployment (whereas in practice, it is actual employment in the sense of exchange of services and money, despite the lack of any feedback to and from the State and its taxations), just as you yourself mentioned the lack of economic development of the area. The latter is a better explanation of the higher unemployment rates in the South than the presence of crime may be, while the former shows one factor that most definitely skews unemployment statistics more towards the negative than what reality reflects. Finally, I wish to remind you that crime rates are also influenced by non-registered individuals such as illegal immigrants (present in the North and the South alike, but we're probably both aware of the enormous intake of them that the South is subject to, compared to other parts of Italy), while unemployment rates obviously don't take those categories into consideration, further skewing possible correlations between unemployment and crime.  Considering all this, I reject your initial statement:   this phenomenon wouldn't occur if everyone were employed and able to earn an honest living.   We are both aware of how the largest economically impacting crimes are perpetrated by people that are already rich. If everyone was employed and able to earn a honest living, crime would still exist: poverty is not the only reason for its existence and in the specific case of Southern Italy, the numbers are skewed enough for it to very likely be a minor factor than it may appear at first sight."

AskSocialScience,33eycs,Integralds,-1,Wed Apr 22 13:49:40 2015 UTC,"I think I understand what the federal funds rate is: it is an effective ceiling for the overnight inter-bank exchange market, because if banks need money (do they need money to satisfy liquidity demand, or legislation, or both?) and no other bank is willing to lend below the federal funds rate, then the fed is willing to lend the money at that rate.   That would be the discount rate rather then funds rate. The discount rate is generally the upper bounds of the target funds rate plus 0.5% but does occasionally vary. The discount rate is used by banks that can't secure reasonable terms on the interbank market as well as by banks that need longer term credit facilities (EG facilities are provided for banks which have seasonal deposits, eg farming areas, so they can continue to function throughout the year). There isn't an Australian equivalent of this rate as lender of last resort facilities don't function the same way with RBA.  The funds rate comes in two flavors; target and effective. Target is the target rate FOMC set (and is a range, currently it is 0-0.25) and effective is the rate banks are actually lending to each other at. This is the equivalent of the Australian cash rate.  Generally liquidity via the interbank market is used for settlement purposes. As a (very) simple example suppose I write a check to you for $1m then on the day that check clears my bank owes your bank $1m to settle the transaction, if my bank for whatever reason does not want to use its existing liquid or capital base to settle that they can instead seek an overnight loan from the interbank facility.  The mechanism of action is on liquidity, by adding or removing liquidity from the banking sector you change the supply of liquidity to banks and thus the price they are seeking for that liquidity.   How does this effectively ease the economy, when this rate is lowered? Is it only by reducing the cost of money for banks so that they are more willing to offer loans?   The prime rate is a very simple function of the target rate; its target + n where n is currently 3 but can increase to up to 5.  The prime rate sets the cost of borrowing, it does not change the amount of credit which can be issued (the quality & quantity of capital a bank holds sets that) but simply the cost. It can change the risk position the bank assumes to credit (banks are more willing to extend credit) but primarily it reduces borrowing costs. It also reduces the spread of rates. Without OMO banks may still offer the most creditworthy borrowers rates close to what they would do under OMO but for everyone else the cost of debt would increase substantially, many individuals & organizations would be priced out of the market.  Beyond the + of making it easier for consumers & businesses to access credit a low cost of borrowing also increases consumption & investment, a lower rate on an auto loan means you are more likely to purchase a car. This is the interest rate channel and this is how monetary policy can stimulate demand in the economy.  Other transmission channels include;   Exchange rate channel which stimulates the three private components of output. Asset price channels, higher demand creates a feedback loop which boosts asset prices, capital returns and investment. Outside of the US (particularly in less well developed financial markets) a credit quantity channel does exist whereby monetary policy will modify the total possible lending. Balance sheet effects. Higher asset prices encourage businesses to shift away from low-yield low-risk instruments to those with higher yields.   Its worth noting that the interest rate and asset price channels are the only channels which are overwhelmingly agreed to exist, you can't measure the effects of a single channel directly so developing a hypothesis of a new channel requires one to make propositions about future behavior if the channel exists (and within a fairly narrow variable window) and then wait for those changes to occur to test. Even with empirical support you are only indirectly looking at what is occurring and as such confidence is often not sufficiently high to establish consensus.  A good example of this problem is that the fed & bank of england completely disagree if a balance sheet channel effect exists with QE, even the regional fed banks disagree if the channel actually exists.   Why would we ease monetary policy if its primary (or only) transmission mechanism is to help banks lend money (thereby increasing inflation, house prices, and deteriorating the budgets of renters).   Monetary policy suffers from the pushing on a string problem, absent demand monetary policy will not induce consumption and thus raise inflation. Monetary policy actually takes on special new qualities when this problem arises, while during most of the business cycle a central bank printing and handing that money to a government to spend would be very very very bad indeed they can largely do so with impunity in a liquidity trap."

AskSocialScience,33fi0s,TychoCelchuuu,1 point,Wed Apr 22 13:48:03 2015 UTC,"I understand a person's ontology to be their fundamental beliefs regarding the nature of existence.    This is not what ""ontology"" means. ""Ontology"" is the study of what exists. To the extent that anyone ""has"" an ontology, they ""have"" it like they ""have"" a physics or they ""have"" a chemistry - we would say they have a set of ontological (or physical or chemical) claims that they think are justified that are unified into a general theory.  Animism, meanwhile, is hardly specific enough to call a theory: it's a vague term that describes various beliefs in various cultures about the way things are. In a vague sense, then, we could label various animisms as ""ontologies,"" because having a view of the way things are entails having a view of what things exist, and the latter is the realm of ontology, but this would be leaving out the parts of animism that entail more than just the existence of things.  In any case it's unclear why we would ever care about this. Who cares if something is or isn't an ontology? What possible reason could anyone ever have for asking that question? Philosophers never worry about whether something is or isn't an ontology because even if there is a distinct answer to the question in every given case, it doesn't matter at all.  I know top comments here have to be supported by citations but since nobody in philosophy really worries about animism and because nobody in philosophy worries about whether anything is an ontology, there aren't really any good sources that speak to whether animism is an ontology.

Both the least educated (< HS) and the highest educated (grad. degree) self identify more liberal on average. The middle leans conservative. Partisans in either direction are better educated than moderates on average. The overall correlation is that liberals are slightly better educated on average. This gap is widened when looking at white Americans only. More educated people generally have preferences that don't fit tidily into a left right spectrum. To summarize, controlling for race, income, sex, and party affiliation, more educated people lean right on economic issues and left on social issues.

This is of course partially the result of his groups abstract idealism which defines the free market as the absence of state intervention (or existence..), but then which meets a multitude of problems in studying really existing markets; hence he ends up in a position that requires him to defend the markets he loves but also state it don't really exist.

Whereas other research has emphasized how education influences prejudice through cognitive ability (Wagner & Schönbach, 1984), or whether links between conservative ideology and prejudice are stronger in samples of more educated people than they are in samples of less educated people (Sidanius et al., 1996), our longitudinal analyses refine the understanding of these processes by demonstrating that childhood g predicts racism in adulthood independently of education and socioeconomic status. In our study, we diverged from previous approaches by addressing the novel question of why lower g predicts more negative evaluations of out-groups and by providing evidence of multiple, simultaneous mediators (ideology and intergroup contact). By controlling for participants’ level of education, we avoided a potential confound that troubled researchers who initially posed this intriguing question (Adorno et al., 1950; Allport, 1954).""

Lower levels of abstract reasoning also predicted greater right-wing authoritarianism, which in turn predicted elevated prejudice against homosexuals. Independent of these effects, there was a simultaneous indirect effect through increased intergroup contact: Individuals who had a greater capacity for abstract reasoning experienced more contact with out-groups, and more contact predicted less prejudice. The standardized total effect of abstract reasoning on prejudice was −.36. The standardized indirect effect (−.20; not shown in the figure) through the simultaneously examined mediators was significant (p < .01), and accounted for 55% of the relation between abstract- reasoning ability and negative evaluations of homosexuals (44% via right-wing authoritarianism, 11% via intergroup contact).""

AskSocialScience,339l1c,dbelle92,7,Tue Apr 21 10:53:48 2015 UTC,"Sure.  Here are a couple of examples for reference: Markiplier and Pewdiepie.  Both create video content of themselves playing and commenting on computer games. I'm not sure how well these two represent the 'lets play'er population, but again, we know little about this phenomenon. Their videos are both prerecorded (at Youtube), but also occasionally live-streamed (often at Twitch). Some of the 'lets-play'ers are extremely popular (Pewdiepie has most-subscribed-to channel on the whole of Youtube), and many wonder why that is.  Like /u/jeythejester mentioned, there is obvious entertainment value in their offering: it targets younger people, often without substantial disposable income, letting them partake in computer gaming in a way that wouldn't have been possible for them otherwise. However--keep in mind this is yet to be properly tested--it seems like many younger people prefer to watch these channels regardless of their own access to the same entertainment. This indicates that they are getting something else that falls outside the realm of simple entertainment.  /u/jeythejester (correct me if I'm wrong), suggested that the viewers can get help with emotional or mental difficulties. Going back to the two channels I linked, there is a bit of evidence that they share their own experiences about life, suffering, friendship, love, and so on. They seem to build communities, sometimes with own names for the communities and its members (Pewdiepie: ""bro army"", and ""bro"" respectively). These communities communicate through Youtube, Twitter, tumblr, Reddit and other forms of social media.  I would, from a very naïve standpoint, suspect that young viewers seek refuge in these communities and perhaps look to the 'lets-play'er as role models. Perhaps this could alleviate their mental or emotional difficulties.  I came to the concept from a business angle, but to be honest, the human angle that /u/jeythejester is looking into is far more interesting to me."

The reality of the situation is that we have a lot of trouble disambiguating how culture manifests in our biology.

The divorce rate, the concept of marriage, the utility of marriage for the poor, how birth control interfaces with sexual risk analysis, homosexuality, bisexuality, facultative nonbinary sexuality (""gay for the stay"") etc.  What people are reporting to you is their recognition or feeling that monogamy is a solution to a certain suite of problems.  Whether or not nonmonogamy is an ancestral condition is difficult to establish, but it sure is intuitively the case, as even if those ancestors were monogamous, they probably cheated as often as birds/monkeys/apes/modern humans."

Perhaps you're thinking that such humans might regress back to some ancient time - but even those humans were raised by earlier humans. To some extent, you're asking a flawed question.  To attempt to answer your question, there is no particular universal constant with regards to perfect monogamy, or otherwise. One of the few notable constants in humans is equal reproductive access - all males get the chance to breed, rather than a specific subset (this is only notable because of the large number of species that do not have this). Other commonalities of humans with both pair-bonding and tournament species are nicely discussed here, by Robert Sapolsky.   Honestly, the answer is 'somewhat' - it is possibleto get a feel of what extent that is and isn't true in varying conditions.  Whether it's 'wrong' for you to be perfectly monogamous is a very normative question. Perhaps you mean to ask if it is commonly or naturally occurring, such as homosexuality, another seemingly sub-par reproductive strategy? The only answer to that I can give is 'probably' - it's not too outlandish, but I'm not aware of any studies into it."

The sixth and early fifth centuries came, probably unjustly, to be regarded as the ideal age of education, when children learned obedience and morality, and were not pampered and depraved; when they were beautiful and healthy, not pale-faced, stunted and over-educated. [...]  Call Plato next: ""In a democratic state the schoolmaster is afraid of his pupils and flatters them, and the pupils despise both schoolmaster and paidagogos. The young expect the same treatment as the old, and contradict them and quarrel with them. In fact, seniors have to flatter their juniors, in order not to be thought morose old dotards."" The counts of the indictment are luxury, bad manners, contempt for authority, disrespect to elders, and a love for chatter in place of exercise. (...) Children began to be the tyrants, not the slaves, of their households. They no longer rose from their seats when an elder entered the room; they contradicted their parents, chattered before company, gobbled up the dainties at table, and committed various offenses against Hellenic tastes, such as crossing their legs. They tyrannised over the paidagogoi and schoolmasters. Alkibiades even smacked a literature-master.  [Source: Kenneth J. Freeman. 1922.

AskSocialScience,33863w,Nidhuggg,1 point,Mon Apr 20 12:28:16 2015 UTC,"one political explanation was the move from something like a Keynesian consensus to what is broadly called a neoliberal consensus. The former proclaimed the necessity of full employment (below 3%), whereas the latter accepted unemployment if inflation and productivity issues were to be tackled. So in Britain for example, between 1945 and 1970 unemployment never went above 3%. the last time unemployment was below 3% in the UK was in 1974, since then it has averaged about 6%.1  Of course the real cause of this to which the ideological response is only afterwards, was the general crisis in the 1970s, to which the a response was mass redundancies across Europe and a continued reorientated of production towards developing countries. Despite continued growth across Europe since then, it true this hasn't returned rates of employment to their Keynesian position. This is partly due to growth and wealth coming increasingly from financial sectors which overall have lower rates of employment for the same amount of wealth creation than 'traditional' commodity production. This is partly the result of globalisation of capital insofar as traditional production can be more internationally orientated where cheaper labour exists, but also technology has simply reduced the amount of labour necessary (take British car producers which by 2017 are predicted to overtake the peak production of the 1970s, yet rates of employment in the industry stand today in the tens of thousand, whereas in the 1970s the sector employed way over 1 million people). Another aspect of capital globalisation is the uncoupling of growth from employment; since western countries contain and un-proportional amount of financial wealth, the GDP growth rates of those countries are raised (and lowered) by events in the world more generally. For example the FTSE100 contains only a few companies that employ a considerable population of the UK, yet large share rises and the subsequently imprint of such onto that countries wealth doesn't necessarily entail any large change in UK employment rates. European countries are especially integrated into the world system, and act as mediators of much of the world's wealth, a positive for the general finances of the countries concerned, however it doesn't necessarily result in any rapid decrease in employment. Hence for most European countries you can look at GDP growth history and see a static unemployment rate contrasted with consistent GDP growth and so on. This has been further help by a contained monetary policy which doesn't preference full employment.  [1] source"

Then it would make  economic sense to prepare food that requires few preparation (i.e. processed food) .  Also the poor have perhaps fewer options to invest in decent refrigeration and other food preserving methods. Therefore they would quicker resort to easier preserved foods (i.e. processed food again)
AskSocialScience,334ulb,Yurien,34,Sun Apr 19 21:33:13 2015 UTC,"In the past (pre-industrial/ early industrial society) the primary restriction placed on food from an economic standpoint was the amount of calories a person of means could buy more and richer food and thereby eat more calories (think Henry VIII). A poor person on the other hand would be restricted to an often largely bread based diet (and usually whole grains to boot since they used to be cheaper). An example of this is the Ancient/early medieval Roman bread dole. A poor Roman would receive an allowance of bread and olive oil (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain_supply_to_the_city_of_Rome).   Then, from the shadows, along comes the industrial revolution. Previously meat, one of the more calorie rich foods, was very expensive. With industrial production it becomes available to anyone (think McDonalds Dollar Menu). Even more insidiously, sugars (like corn syrup) have become so cheap as to be almost free. This means that a person can make an incredibly caloric, cheap, and addictive food.   That's just one side of it though, while unhealthful foods became cheaper, healthful foods became relatively more expensive. The industrial revolution made all food cheaper, but unhealthful foods much much more so. In the ancient world most of an average person's income went to food (see Diocletian's Edict on Prices). This means that hamburgers are cheap and wholesome vegetables are more expensive. This is partly to do with demand (most people think hamburgers taste better than broccoli) but also due to the cheapness of sugar (see the book, Sweetness and Power).   Another element is education. The poor are statistically less likely to be educated than the affluent. A person who is uneducated is less likely to know which foods are healthful and which are unhealthful. In a position where the relative healthfulness of foods is not explained, rational actors will seek the cheapest and best tasting foods. Wholesome foods are also less available in poor areas. Supermarkets are businesses with razor thin profit margins. They need to use a huge amount of space and the margins on food are very low. This makes it not economically advantageous to build these businesses in poor inner cities. This creates what are called ""food deserts""; these are places with high populations but low access to supermarkets. If you are too poor to own a car you can't simply drive to the rich area to buy food. Often, McDonals/ 7-11 is the only food choice that the poor have (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_desert).  These factors (and a bunch of others that I could go more into) make the poor more likely to be obese."

Early economists did indeed view innovation as a exogenous aspect, especially those who were interested in macro economics and growth accounting. They simply thought of technological progress (i.e. innovation) as a given. Later, the realization set in that innovation did not fall from the sky but was necessarily funded by investments in R&D.  This led to endogenous growth models which incorporated this aspect of technological change.  At a micro level, innovation was quite quickly a topic that was reasonably well studied in great thanks to the seminal works of Schumpeter. He formulated the two primary drivers of innovation: new entrants (heroic entrepreneurs) and large scale actors. These simple modelsmade innovation a subject that is easier studied. With the advancement of all kinds of indicators (e.g. patents) innovation is now a well studied subject especially at a micro level.  Innovation is also studied extensively by other disciplines as well. Think here of historians, sociologists and even philisophers. Do not let the media fool you into thinking that the concept is only relevant in an economical context.  As for your understanding of the concept innovation. innovation is a term these days that is easily thrown around when anything new is introduced; or by politicians when they promise to increase innovation(ironically innovation used to be thought of as a bad thing). In the academic sense i would construct innovation as follows: an innovation is the application of  some concept in a new context. as opposed to invention which is simply the creation of a concept. Because innovation always requires you to do something different it is, contrary to what economists and politicians might say, not something that is easily done, nor something that can be easily predicted or improved.

AskSocialScience,3359o2,Heathen92,2,Sun Apr 19 18:01:43 2015 UTC,"In 1971, the change had only just begun. The American Express card, the first general-purpose credit card, had been invented thirteen years before, and the modern national credit-card system had only really come into being with the advent of Visa and MasterCard in 1968. A partial factor in it's increased use was Nixon's move to take the dollar off the gold standard which contributed to the stagflation of the 1970s. However the larger factors were the problems of the 1970s more generally, centrally a profitability crisis within capitalism as a whole. The response to a perceived issue of underconsumption is the issuing of credit, which became increasingly favourable by financial institutions as regulations of their activities decreased throughout the 1970s, and Glass–Steagall Legislation became diluted by continually revised interpretations by the Federal Reserve (and some annulments of it's constituent parts). Not to mention in 1980 Congress eliminated federal usury laws which limited interest to between 7-10%. The result was that through the 1980s and 90s, creditors could issue credit with relatively low risk insofar as they could 'hedge' risk, but their profit was substantial. By the 1990s credit had become completely normalised, replacing paper money to a large degree (especially - and perhaps more importantly – for larger transactions).  Total U.S. outstanding consumer debt stands at $3.33 trillion as of March 20151. With Generation X in 2012 having 42 percent more overall debt than other generations2. The problems is that such money creation leads to inflation and bubbles. Credit is the financialisation of money. It also signify's the movement of control away from central governments and towards financial institutions and their often problematic relationship to central banks; of course such a transition is typical of the move from keynesianism to neoliberalism of which the transformation of credit is just an aspect. Even if the monetarists policy was always an attempt to control money, it did so under contradictory conditions. Both inflation and debt accumulation have evidently problematic results for working people insofar as financial institutions can - as long as they don't overextend - benefit equally from a crash as a boom, whereas the majority of people benefit only from the latter. A systemic problem identified by keynes was also a tendency towards underconsumption, credit solves this problem. Unlike China - where 1/3 of earning are saved, a serious problem for that countries economy insofar as money is more 'unproductive' if saved, a cultural problem that it is hoped will change towards western consumerism where only 1/20 of earning are saved. Credit in essence forced a large amount of peoples wages to be automatically reinsserted back into the economy (in the form of debt and credit repayments on credit cards, mortgages etc.). Whilst revealing the origin and function of consumerism, Keynes' analysis (focused on the 1929 crash) was as wrong as his prediction than the rentier class would itself be eliminated3 after it's 'historic mission was completed'. Underconsumption itself hides the deeper systemic problem of capital profitability. The 1970s was after all the era in which productivity gains split from wages: productivity has more than doubled where as wages have on average stagnated in real terms. In attempting to negate the profitability problem, capital inadvertently created a consumption problem, (the solution to which in turn created an inflationary problems). Of course credit offsets this downward pressure on wages by maintaining consumption, evidently though the problem is only delayed rather than solved, with debt and credit paying of debt and credit, the potential for realignment and crash is always immanent. But nevertheless everyone gets a credit card (the American average is 3.74).  The rise of credit was a particular if necessary phase within capitalism caused by a tendency towards a declining rate of profit which ended the keynesian boom years themselves. However insofar as this tendency is systemic, so a solution can never be found, it can only be transformed, delayed, or moved. Hence the total debt of consumers, banks, nations and so on, doesn't exist to be repaid and never will. The cyclical boom-busts are the result of a credit system, and a financial system more generally, that bares only a tenuous relationship to real production. Credit is just sacrificing the future to the present, a 'solution' interrupted by crashes of which I doubt we have seen the final or largest yet. The derivatives market for example is worth somewhere around $1 Quadrillion, 20 times the size of the world's economy, and 20 times higher than before the 2008 crash (even if this is nominal value). The question is really what does this tell us about capitalism, it's vulnerabilities, it's contradictions, in it's late stage. Why is a financial system essentially non-existent in the 1950s, so central to the functioning of global capital accumulation today?

AskSocialScience,331twy,efxhoy,1 point,Sun Apr 19 13:00:25 2015 UTC,"Here is a good explanation by Greg Mankiw:    Economic theory says that the wage a worker earns, measured in units of output, equals the amount of output the worker can produce. Otherwise, competitive firms would have an incentive to alter the number of workers they hire, and these adjustments would bring wages and productivity in line. If the wage were below productivity, firms would find it profitable to hire more workers. This would put upward pressure on wages and, because of diminishing returns, downward pressure on productivity. Conversely, if the wage were above productivity, firms would find it profitable to shed labor, putting downward pressure on wages and upward pressure on productivity. The equilibrium requires the wage of a worker equaling what that worker can produce.   http://gregmankiw.blogspot.se/2006/08/how-are-wages-and-productivity-related.html"
AskSocialScience,331twy,HealthcareEconomist3,2,Sun Apr 19 14:11:05 2015 UTC,"I hear often about how productivity has gone up, while wages have been unchanged.   This is a mixture of misstatement and misunderstanding.  One of my favorites is this which excludes all public & supervisory workers and any non-regular earnings while comparing productivity for the entire economy. Then there is this which uses median household income, which stagnated due to households getting both smaller & younger rather then a real drop in earnings. Or this which excludes all salaried workers.  The amount of utter garbage purporting to show the earnings situation while actually simply being a demonstration of how to lie with statistics is staggering. So what is going on?  Using both measures of total compensation and labor share (discussed in more detail here) only transitory divergence can be seen. Labor share is the more important of the two because its mathematically impossible for labor earnings not to track productivity growth and for labor & capital shares to remain stable.  Why the huge problems?   The main source of data for US earnings is the diseased one-legged hooker of data. CPS is used to understand income between censuses and the methodology is thus; select subjects for surveys, survey them for 16 months (break in the middle 8 months) and ask them 5 income questions in months 4 and 16. We don't even ask them to use their pay stubs, they are asked to guess. There are three employer surveys which mostly use payroll data feeds and show a much more optimistic view of earnings. CPI-U isn't a particularly good measure of inflation, it excludes all rural communities and we know there is a pretty significant under-reporting problem with CPS consumption data as the totals are significantly less then sales & producer data (mixture of measurement problems, using consumption diaries, as well as durable spending that CPS simply can't capture because its too irregular). Using PCE (how the fed measure inflation) or deflators changes the picture somewhat. Even if we were using an ideal measure of inflation we have a problem that different income groups experience inflation in very different ways; low-income groups experience much more slowly cost growth then high-income groups, stagnant real average incomes means a narrowing of income inequality (gains for low-income, losses for high-income). Using CPI to look at household expenditures basic consumption (housing, groceries etc) shows a consistent real decline in these costs over the last several generations even using the average measures, even if we showed real incomes to be stagnant are they really if real discretionary income continues to rise? On the previous point using an inflationary measure that confines to where low-income individuals shop and the basket of goods they purchase income of the bottom decile rose by 30% between 1970 and 2000. There are enormous variations in regional prices & incomes which makes the use of national figures relatively questionable. As an example of this if the South simply ceased to exist so too would about half of the total minimum wage or below workers, 70% of the persistent poverty counties and there would be a significant rise in all national aggregate measures of average & median incomes. Some of this is explainable by the South being inhabited by half-human idiots, mostly its simply representative of a larger rural population, lower prices and lower incomes in response to the lower prices. Using national data for the US to understand these issues is like using EU level data instead of country level data to look at EU incomes & prices, combining data from Germany & Spain isn't going to be anymore useful then combining data from MA & TX.    Also, where can I check this information to see it for myself?    BLS publish almost all data here. For CPS NBER publish microdata feeds you can use here, if you want more then means or medians then you want the microdata feeds.  Edit: Also for a glossary of income terms when you are looking at income data;   Wages - Regular pay for hourly employees Salary - What you expect it to be Non-wage income - O/T, tips etc Earnings - The combination of all of the above"

AskSocialScience,330n9i,HallBregg,5,Sat Apr 18 12:58:24 2015 UTC,"Short answer is ""yes, kind of.""  College is just different in other countries, and being government-controlled means there's a lot less money for culture-builders like events and sports teams. Keeping costs down also means higher class sizes (think your mandatory Psych 101 class size but for a lot more classes). Additionally, you don't necessarily get price breaks if you're not a citizen. This link says Edinburgh is $2900 for EU citizens, $28,000 for non-citizens, and reduced tuition for Oxford or Cambridge requires EU residency for 3 years of high school.   I think Canada would be less of a culture shock, and I have friends who went to Canadian colleges and they seemed to have a similar college experience to my American one, but an undergraduate year at McMaster is still $20,000, which is more expensive than a US state school, and you have to deal with living in another country and all the hassle it brings.  Also there's the issue of how much respect a foreign degree gets in the USA, if your ultimate plan is to come back to work. I don't know specifics on that, and it probably depends on the school.   So basically, it'll be a different college experience, so it's not an even apples-to-apples price comparison. It will also likely cost you non-resident prices to go to school in another country, so costs are higher than you would think. And the benefits of college may be reduced. But it's certainly cheaper to get a foreign degree than to go to George Washington or some other super expensive private school."
AskSocialScience,330n9i,nemoomen,1 point,Sat Apr 18 13:40:08 2015 UTC,"I would assume, perhaps wrongly, that a degree from a university in another western nation would probably have a similar level of 'respect' as a U.S. institution.  Notably, the idea of 'respect' for an insitution is a particularly US thing. Given that, as you mentioned, universities in other western countries are controlled by the state, their standards are all pretty much the same. One place is not, at the end of the day, really any better or worse than the next.  To what extent do things like respect and prestige matter in the US?  My guess is it's becasue there is a lack of much central control of universities, so they can vary widely in their standards?  I've heard of places which shouldn't even really be considered universities, places which have religious doctrinal pledges etc., and bans on interracial dating.  Which brings me to something else which differs - in the US it seems colleges are much more concerned with their student's private lives? Perhaps because of a significant live-on-campus population?   (As an aside, I would see a lack of 'culture building' to be a good thing - I don't quite understand things like giant college sports stadiums and big-business football teams - what does that have to do with tertiary education?)"
AskSocialScience,330n9i,nemoomen,2,Sun Apr 19 11:51:56 2015 UTC,"I can't put a number on it, but reputation is a big part of choosing a school. There are low-quality, even online-only universities that just represent 'a degree' more than anything. There are lots of for-profit universities, and some of these are so low quality that some employers won't count them as degrees for hiring purposes. Then there are community colleges that vary in quality but often succeed in vocational training for very low cost, so they're good for niche learning. There are state schools that are partially subsidized by the state government, which often have bad reputations but the better ones are among the best schools in the country (the top few California and NY state schools, Penn State in Pennsylvania, and a few others) and they are recognized as such. And then there are the very top private institutions (there are private schools at every range of quality) like the Ivy League schools, where a decent GPA basically guarantees a life in the upper class.  So I guess my point was that there are a wide range in terms of quality, but also type of school.  There is a nationwide accreditation process that is decent, but not foolproof. It's not too hard to hit the minimum criteria, so that's why the 'reputation' game is important too.  There are religious schools with curfews, mandatory religious training, bans on premarital sex and the like  (I've never heard of a ban on interracial dating, that seems very illegal and super racist). But a college is a choice, so no one goes there unless they want to abide by those rules. I don't really have an issue with it, I just wouldn't go there myself.  The concern about private lives does have to do with on-campus population, but also the religious mandates are a select few universities. In a lot of schools the 'concern for students private lives' is primarily in the form of holding events for students to go to, and other nonmandatory things. They try to crack down on underage drinking but that's because that's the law.   Culture building is related to reputation building. People want to have pride in their school, and having a good football team brings pride. Also it's a way to bring national attention to a school, if they're always in the sports world spotlight. Also there's all the money it brings in. Again, you don't have to go to a school with a good football team if that's not what you're interested in."

They're already fully unsecured loans, so credit models don't try to include loss-recovery from collateral (the house, in mortgages).  Student loans are also generally not dischargeable in bankruptcy and many are guaranteed by the Federal government.

A college education is still a really good investment. This isn't because of selection effects - see The Caual Effect of Education on Earnings. Virtually no one pays market price for a college education. The financial aid process allows universities to practice almost-perfect price discrimination. They can effectively charge a different price for every student, so that the market just follows the demand curve up until their maximum tuition level. The is definitely is a sheepskin effect - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)#A_basic_job-market_signalling_model - for college diplomas. But this is extremely well understood (Spence shared the economics Nobel with Akerlof for signalling theory). I think that separating bright, talented and hard working 18 year olds from bright, talented and lazy 18 year olds is a non-trivial process.  Tons of articles imply that you don't need higher education, because you can take classes online.

The average amount of student loan debt is about 28,400 which can be a lot but is about a car payment for a moderately priced car.    Overall College still has a very high rate of return, about 15% on average which is very good for investments.    Furthermore the earnings for having a college degree are higher in the US than anywhere else in the OECD1:  ""The college premium is larger in the United States than in virtually any other economically developed country.  Across the 34 countries that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,  employers on average are willing to pay 1.8 times as much for a college graduate as they are for an unskilled worker.  But in the United States, employers pay 2.6 times as much for a college graduate.  This, in spite of the fact that the supply of college graduates in the United States is among the highest in the OECD.  A recent Milken Institute study found that for each additional year of college attained by the residents of a region, the per capita gross domestic product of the region increases a remarkable 17.4 percent. The authors argue that the increased regional productivity is largely the result of the increased productivity of a college-educated workforce. (Interestingly, they do not see a similar jump in productivity for additional education at the high school level.)""  About 4% of student have very large debt 100K+, but overall college is still a good and moderately priced investment in one's future.   Edit: This report here also shows no difference in living arrangements between those who borrowed and those who did not 1 year after completion of degree.

AskSocialScience,32zegy,ummmbacon,4,Sat Apr 18 02:40:15 2015 UTC,Thank you for the detailed response. So the main problems are that 1. Student loan debt is slowing economic growth and 2. Colleges will eventually raise tuition to a point where enrollment declines and they will be forced to default on their loans. So the real bubble is not student loan debt but college debt. Is there any data on how much of a mental toll increased tuition has on students and whether or not it's realistic to think they will eventually just stop repaying their loans?

AskSocialScience,3302ch,ilikecaramelapplepop,7,Sat Apr 18 04:43:48 2015 UTC,"What prevented the Great Recession from lasting as long or getting as bad as the Depression?   Fundamentally different root causes, very different policy response (notably the fed) as well as a better understanding of tools at our disposal to manage the recession.  2007 was simply a housing bubble that had been building since 2004 going pop, structural issues in the financial sector causes a massive contraction in the credit markets in response to this, capital ran for the hills and so we spiraled the drain for a while. The housing bubble was caused by a mixture of federal housing policy, lender greed and the fed failing to cool off the bubble. The structural issues have existed for many decades and are caused by a fundamental issue with the way we securitize debt as well has extremely lacking capital requirements for banks.  The 1929-1933 recession involved a speculative bubble, a string of bank failures and the fed deploying the inverse tools for both. The fed of 1929 used some extremely flawed models in understanding monetary policy and how to deploy it, they understood the dangers of deflation but falsely believed they needed to keep rates high after the speculative bubble popped to drive capital elsewhere; this triggered a deflationary spiral which wiped out about a third of US GDP.  During 2007 the fed response was almost perfect, rates came down very quickly, Bernanke was sticking his fingers in every pie attempting to get an adequate policy response (some he succeeded, TARP, others he didn't, lifting of mark-to-market rules) and surprisingly quickly managed to get congress to extend QE powers to the fed. QE acted like a drill stop for the fissure which was the recession, it forced capital to stop running for the hills, reduced costs of borrowing for lenders and generally smoothed out markets. Fiscal response was relatively lackluster, while ARRA had a positive effect it was almost certainly very small and relatively insignificant; the confidence response (showing something is being done, convincing capital to come out to play again) was probably stronger then the actually MPC effect from the policy.  During the great depression after the fed had finished causing a deflationary spiral they then also failed to fulfill the primary reason they existed at the time, act as a lender of last resort. Bank runs are an example of mass hysteria, people think they are about to loose all their money so they take it out of banks which distresses the banks and causes their failure which does result in a loss for account holders. Dealing with them is a confidence game, you convince people that withdrawing their money is unnecessary. One of the mechanisms that is used to do this is liquidity services from the fed, if a bank has a run then they provide loans to the bank which prevents its failure; when people see it hasn't failed even with everyone taking out their money they put it back and hopefully the run stops. The fed failed to do this and so a few isolated runs turned in to a systemic run which eviscerated a very large proportion of banks. On the fiscal side the New Deal had almost no impact nationally, some states benefited hugely while others sustained massive losses due to the program. The great depression ended simply because it had run its course, no aspect of policy during the era either lessened or shortened the event.  TL;DR: During the depression policy multiplied the effect of the recession and did nothing to lessen its length or size, during the last recession policy was mostly very good and massively reduced its length & size.  If you are in a book mood this represents a relatively laymen accessible discussion of policy history including the depression."

Terrorism is a means to an end, but it can fit into a number of different political strategies that groups can take. The IRA ended up combining a fairly small militant wing, broken into a cell structure to stage various relatively small attacks, and a nominally separate, non-violent political party to seek change through legislative influence. See Peter Neumann's article 'The Bullet and the Ballot Box'.    But this was because the IRA was dedicated to gaining independence (broadly put) for one small, defined, and institutionally unified piece of territory. Early on, they dropped their never-particularly-strong socialist ideological programme and focused mainly on territorial goals.    This is very unlike AQ, ISIS, and Boko Haram. Actually, all three of those groups are also unlike one-another. This is why I really don't like the term 'terrorist group': it means we identify a group by one of their more prominent methods of political action, rather than by their goals, values, or whatever.    Boko Haram is not interested in building a counter-state, and seems mainly interested in causing mayhem to the state and its constituents. We can try to understand this in ideological terms, but it doesn't much resemble the classical understanding of an insurgent group as a movement to subvert and supplant the state. ISIS is attempting to build a state, and its violence is more clearly devoted towards that. It therefore has some need of 'diplomatic' connections, but these really seem afaik to take the form of back-door ties to wealthy gulfies. There are a few accessible posts on this at Political Violence at a Glance, a great blog by academics for a more general audience. AQ is...well, many things.

Transactions between Chinese companies and a foreign entity were generally denominated in US dollars. With Chinese companies unable to hold US dollars and foreign companies unable to hold Chinese yuan, all transactions would go through the People's Bank of China. Once the sum was paid by the foreign party in dollars, the central bank would pass the settlement in renminbi to the Chinese company at the state-controlled exchange rate.""  Because the government was an intermediary in major exchanges between RMB and other currencies, they could set the exchange rate to something other than what it might be if it were freely traded."

The experience is normative and without pathological sequelae for members of these communities, and therefore by definition cannot be abnormal. On the other hand, for an adult white North American, it might well be a hallucination with serious mental health consequences"
AskSocialScience,32tsc1,mujahid69,3,Fri Apr 17 00:30:11 2015 UTC,"Indeed, this is a hard question to answer. Like /u/mujahid69, this is outside of my area of knowledge, but I did find this article of which I quote a section below that seems to relate with your question, at the least.    Al-Issa32 has suggested that Euro-American culture itself dampens the rate of hallucinations because the shared culture strives to clarify and distinguish whether a given experience is real or imaginary, and when individuals seem not to be able to make such a distinction by reporting something that seems to be a hallucination, they are likely to be labeled as out of contact with reality and therefore pathological. In contrast, he argued, many non-Western societies do not make such a rigid distinction between reality and fantasy. One might expect, then, that hallucinations would be more readily reported outside of the Western setting.  Epidemiological studies seem to support this inference. Johns et al33 demonstrated that reports of hallucinations in the general population varied significantly across different ethnic groups living in the United Kingdom. In this study, 5196 participants from ethnic minorities (Caribbean, Indian, African, Asian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and Chinese) and 2867 White UK respondents were screened for mental health problems and asked about hallucinations. Reports of hallucinations were around 2.5 times higher in the Caribbean sample (9.8%) compared with the white sample (4%). Compared with the white sample, the experience was only half as common in the South Asian sample (4% vs 2.3%).  Anthropological work certainly also demonstrates that hallucinations may suddenly increase in a social group at a particular time. For example, after the death of Menachem Schneerson—a Hasidic Rebbe believed by many of his followers to be the messiah and thus a man who would not die in an ordinary way—many followers reported seeing him.34 The pattern of their reports resembles the reports of seeing Jesus after his death described in the Bible: they are rare; brief; and, often, surprising mundane. Jesus appears as a gardener: the Rebbe shows up in the kitchen.   Furthermore, it seems as though there are not many studies with a non-clinical population, which would probably answer your question more directly.   A number of issues need to be addressed in future studies. For instance, the issue of cross-cultural hallucination prevalence rates in the general (nonclinical) population has not been examined in a direct and in-depth manner. In a recent review of studies examining auditory hallucination prevalence in the general population,10 no such studies are reported.    tl;dr: It at least seems people are more likely to report them in societies that do not seek to distinguish the reality from the fantasy. More studies needed on non-clinical populations.   Reference: Larøi, F., Luhrmann, T. M., Bell, V., Christian, W. A., Deshpande, S., Fernyhough, C., ... & Woods, A. (2014).

AskSocialScience,32t1wx,LetThemEatWar32,4,Thu Apr 16 14:12:35 2015 UTC,"Saving is income minus consumption expenditure. Private sector saving means that profits of firms, combined with income of individuals (net of taxes) minus money spent on consumption goods is positive. Now, this money has to come from somewhere - in order for their to profits and income, somebody has to have bought goods - if not consumption goods, then it must have been investment goods. Without considering government spending or interaction with other countries, that is where the equation S = I comes from.  However, if we add in the government and outside countries, the savings could be spent on something other than investment. First, let's add in the government. The government takes in money in taxes, and spends some (possibly different) amount of money. If it spends more than it takes in, it borrows from the private sector to do so, and so some of the private sector savings are used for government spending. We get the equation  Sp + Sg = I.   Finally, we add in the outside world. Other than investment goods, the profits and individual income could come from selling more goods to other countries than they do to us - in return, they owe us money. (Alternatively, we could get money from other countries from existing financial investments in those countries, or from people sending money to their family here).  Then we get Sp + Sg = I + CA  So private sector savings is simply income minus consumption expenditure, and those savings can be allocated towards investment, government spending, or financial investments abroad.   Directly addressing your question, in order for the private sector to financially save, by which I mean reducing debt (different from the economic concept of saving above) it needs to take in more money than it spends on consumption and investment goods. Well, where can that money come from? It can only come from either the government spending more money on goods than it takes in, or it can come from abroad.   The banks deleveraging is not an example of private sector saving per se - if a bank sells a financial asset like a bond, it either uses the money to buy a safer financial asset like a government bond, or it will pay back a loan to some other private sector entity. That is deleveraging, but not saving - on net, the private sector owes the same amount of money. The bank owes less money, but the private sector entity owns fewer financial assets.  Note that it is entirely possible for the private sector to deleverage - reduce gross outstanding debt - without actually owing less, on net.   Actual private sector saving would be like a household deciding not to buy that car after all, and instead spending the money on bonds. If everyone does this at the same time, and the government does not want to spend more money than it takes in, and nothing is happening to the current account, then the equation does not add up and something will go wrong along the way - where is this money the households are saving coming from? The equations in this post are all accounting identities, rather than economic relationships - they always hold, because the money HAS to come from somewhere.  In this sense, private sector saving has to come at the expense of government dissaving.  Most books on international economics will contain detailed treatments of this topic, I particularly like 'International Economics' by Krugman, Obstfeld and Melitz."

EDIT:   Note that it is entirely possible for the private sector to deleverage - reduce gross outstanding debt - without actually owing less, on net.   1) I don't quite understand this part. Could you elaborate? Or is it self explanatory and I am being dumb? Actual private sector saving would be like a household deciding not to buy that car after all, and instead spending the money on bonds. If everyone does this at the same time, and the government does not want to spend more money than it takes in, and nothing is happening to the current account, then the equation does not add up and something will go wrong along the way  2) Allow me to go full Peter Schiff for a moment and ask: could they be buying gold or some other asset like that instead of government bonds? I suppose that would require an increase in the supply of gold (or else there would be no net increase in the holdings thereof), and thus ""I"" would have to rise.  3) Final question: Is this what was happening after the financial crisis then? The private sector was saving? Is this necessary after a financial crisis? My lecturer seemed to think he was making the case for the necessity of government deficits, which makes me think (S-I) > 0 is required for some reason. I see why deleveraging was necessary: the banks were worried about going bankrupt and had very small ""capital cushions"". But why did the private sector need to save more?"
AskSocialScience,32t1wx,Ventural,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:24:24 2015 UTC,"1)  This is the difference between net and gross. Let's say we have a private sector without any government at all. Then on net, the private sector can't owe any money - any debt owed by one person is owned by another person. There could still be gross debt: person a lends to person b.   Take the example of a bank. Banks have deposits, that they proceed to lend out to households and businesses. Let's say the bank decides to ask the money back on half of its loans, and then gives that money back to the depositors. The private sector overall on net owes the same amount of money, there is just less gross debt outstanding.  2) gold occupies a bit of an odd place between a currency, a commodity, and a physical asset. The principle is the same, however - if households are buying gold, who is selling it? The same argument applies as for bonds.   3) What exactly is 'necessary' after a financial crisis is a contentious topic. Personally, I think people who argue for the necessity of government deficits from the accounting identity you asked about are confusing saving and deleveraging. Banks, financial institutions and households can deleverage without saving. A bank can lend less and take in less in deposits, and a household could sell a house, pay off their mortgage, and rent instead. These actions do not change net private sector debt, but do reduce total outstanding debt and leverage in the economy."

However, the loss of the al-Aqsa mosque and Jerusalem as a whole are definitely some of the greatest sources of anti-western feeling. Europe, and Britain in particular, because of their early aid and support to Israel, as well as the Balfour Declaration. And America, because of the U.S.'s blank cheque for Israel since, its support in the war of 1973, and then things like the Negroponte Doctrine.  The loss of Mandate Palestine, and Jerusalem in particular, is known as the Nakba, or the catastrophe, in the Arab world. It's also common for some Arabs to say things like ""Next year in Jerusalem"", when a guest or family is visiting (although not all do this).   The Sykes-Picot treaty is another event that has entered popular culture as a disastrous event. It's so pervasive that ISIL recently proclaimed to be finally destroying the borders that make it up in one of their propaganda videos. It's effective propaganda precisely because it is a visceral source of anti-western sentiment across the region, that even a bunch of uneducated militants can reference.   As for buildings specifically, there are none that come to mind. The overwhelming issue is and has always been Palestine. For example:   From New York, Harold Beeley, the Palestine expert of the Foreign Office, reported that in the view of the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Fadhil al-Jamali, Iraq faced three problems in this order of importance: “Palestine, economic development, and Treaty revision.” It is perhaps not surprising that the Eastern Department did not attach any particular significance to Jamali’s ranking of the Palestine question as the foremost problem facing Iraq since he made his judgement from the vantage point of the United Nations. What is perhaps more noteworthy is Nuri’s response during his visit to London on his return journey to Baghdad in the aftermath of the partition vote in New York. Nuri, like all Arab leaders, was furious with the Americans: “It would take a long time for the United States to live down the intense resentment they had now aroused in the Arab countries.”   ""The British Empire in the Middle East"" by W.M Roger Louis, p. 330   Note that Nuri al-Said (a Prime Minister of Iraq) made that comment in 1947.

The rule of Anwar Saddat is highly resented by many Egyptians, as he mostly pandered to the U.S and spent most of his time trying to gain back their support, while solidifying his authoritarian style rule. Toward the end of his regime he made peace with Israel, and went and prayed at Al-Aqsa under the protection of the IDF. All of which was seen as spitting in the face of the Muslim world.

During ""Temple Times"", all Jews were nominally required to make pilgrimage to Jerusalem three times a year for the major festivals (I don't know why it's not said during Sukkot, the other time that require pilgrimage). These pilgrimages are no longer required so long as there is no Temple... but the historical belief is that if the Third Temple were built, pilgrimages and sacrifice would become mandatory again. Further, that the Third Temple could only be built as part of the Messianic Era (there's a tradition that it will descend directly from heaven). The statement ""next year in Jerusalem"" does not have anything to do with political Zionism started by Theodore Herzl in the 19th century, but is a much older prayer for (essentially) the coming of the Messiah. When a Passover Seder is conducted in Jerusalem, the payer becomes ""Next year in Jerusalem, rebuilt"". Again, the plain meaning of the phrase might be unclear--what needs to be rebuilt? I was there, they have modern buildings, tram line, there are no ruins anywhere, the place looks great. What needs to be rebuilt is the Temple (which only Messiah can do).  This is the same reason why religious Jews ask (during each of the three daily prayer services) ask G-d to ""restore himself to Zion"", because G-d's presence dwelled in the Temple. Technically, religous Jews in Israel believe they are still ""in exile"" and will be until Messiah comes. some Dati-Leumi people believe that Geulah, ""redemption"", the opposite of Galut, ""exile"", began with modern Zionism, but this is a minority even among religious Jews, even just among religious Jews in Israel--most still believe they are technically in Galut (secular Jews, including the majority of Israelis, tend to associate exile only with place of residence)."

AskSocialScience,32pkn8,crossbeats,12,Wed Apr 15 18:04:27 2015 UTC,"I actually just got done reading this over the weekend. If you are uncomfortable with math but have a reasonable understanding of economics then just read around the math, it provides an excellent summary of recent work in this area.   It would obviously cause the collapse of nearly all, if not all, lenders. But would institution for whom student loans make up a smaller percentage of their loans be able to stay afloat?   Short-run we would see a pretty significant financial shock if the government didn't compensate lenders (and particularly those holding SLABS's), outstanding private student debt is around $200b. Assuming government federalized the debt and then canceled it we would see some fairly mild disruption as the lenders wound down but nothing particularly troublesome. Also while law isn't my field (insert generic lawyer hating joke) i'm not sure its constitutionally sound for the government to simply cancel private debt.  A larger problem is how they go about doing this, SLABS derivatives exist (as well as sandwich derivatives with other forms of ABS) that can't easily be picked apart so its not nearly as simple as just buying all the debt and pushing the delete button.   Would a lack of student loans available force colleges and universities to lower tuition rates?   One presumes you would replace student loans with a grant or other publicly funded system, assuming appropriate controls were in place then yes. While the college premium still more then compensates for the rise in tuition costs a large portion of those costs are attributable to aspects of tertiary education that offer no academic advantage.  Post-graduation 4 year community college graduates actually do slightly better then those graduating from traditional schools, clearly the optimal level of spending to maximize educational outcomes is below that which schools typically charge today.   Would there be an increase in trade professions? Would increased trade professions lower or raise the overall unemployment rate?   Higher levels of student debt have a pretty strong effect on post-graduation employment choices, we would see a reduction in those entering high-pay professional fields and an increase in those entering low-pay public service fields. We would also see a small increase in the non-completion rate (this is probably the worst effect we would see, its already not great). We probably wouldn't see much (if any) change in enrollment rates, the existing credit constraint on admissions is very small and we are already have very high enrollment (probably too high, that's a whole other discussion though). We would see some change in academic focus but difficult to quantify (people would be more likely to choose a field they want to do over one which they think will pay well).  I'm not sure if you could really objectively model this as a welfare gain or a welfare loss, the typical substitution of income for welfare in this situation doesn't appear to be useful as the choice of taking a lower paid job which makes you happier is welfare maximizing but would this counteract the loss of lifetime earnings?.  I'm not sure what effect this would have on long-run employment, i'm not sure you could even realistically model this.   How would people age 20-35 having an increased spending capacity affect the economy financially?    This is going to play off the reduction in income effects, the only significant change in spending that can be observed currently is those without debt are more likely to be homeowners but its not clear if this due to a constraint imposed by debt or simply different choices as the groups don't have identical demographics.  Again i'm not sure this could even be reasonably modeled, the only group who would unquestionably gain would be those who don't complete who currently both have debt but don't have the earnings premium of a degree.   If lenders folded after losing that much money to forgiven student loans, would anyone even be able to get a mortgage? Would mortgage become less necessary, and less common due to an increase in expendable income?   Presuming government buying the debt no impact, even if they don't there would long-run be no impact. Higher disposable income would translate in to an increase in the value of homes people buy."

AskSocialScience,32pzua,RS-METAL,8,Wed Apr 15 20:25:29 2015 UTC,"It is an issue of reportage, because child soldiers do exist in areas outside of Sub-Saharan Africa.  The human rights group Child Soldiers International identifies the presence of child soldiers among the Armed Forces and among rebel groups in several African, Middle Eastern, and East Asian countries, as well as in Colombia.  Right now, Child Soldiers International is condemning the recruitment of child combatants by Houthi rebels in Yemen.   Also, historically there has been widespread use of children in conflicts like the Iran-Iraq war, during the Warsaw uprising, and during the last days of the Third Reich.  Now, to answer your question about the perception of child soldiers being mentally associated with Sub-Saharan African conflicts. I would peg that association to the reportage of civil wars in Liberia from 1989 until 2003, and the associated conflict in Sierra Leone, which drew attention for the atrocities committed and the widespread use of child soldiers by various factions.  Similarly, in 1996 Laurent Kabila's rebel army that overthrew Mobutu Sese Seko contained several regiments of child soldiers. This drew some attention in the western press at the time, but much more attention was paid when Laurent Kabila was assassinated by one of his bodyguards who  was 18 and a former child soldier.  A more recent example would be the #kony2012 campaign, which drew much attention to the LRA's practice of abducting children and pressing them into service as child soldiers.  These three very famous examples of particularly successful or abhorrent uses of child soldiers did/do much to draw the attention of reporters to the narrative of child soldiers, and with that attention, encourages reporters on African conflicts to ask further questions about Child Soldiers.  On the other hand, if a reporter is in Colombia, I would argue they are much more likely to focus on the narratives of FARC kidnapping foreigners for ransom, or of FARC and paramilitaries connections to the Cocaine trade. Discussion of teenagers being inducted into Colombian intelligence or rebel groups has not made a story that has become a cause celebre.  Or similarly, the conflict in Yemen is reported through the lenses of Sunni/Gulf States military action against Shia/Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. Thus, the narrative is framed in terms of Western or American fears of Mid-east instability and growing Iranian influence. Stories about recruitment of child soldiers can't easily be fit into that narrative, even if the reporter is aware and inclined to report on that phenomenon."
AskSocialScience,32ox9u,curiusjopage,10,Wed Apr 15 15:12:26 2015 UTC,"I have an Econ bachelors. I work in the strategy office for a technology company, and I support the sales team on occasion.   This is pretty heavily in the Micro-econ fields of Managerial Econ or Econ of strategy.  I believe your manager used the term Classical vs. non-classical econ inappropriately. I think somewhere in the back of his head, he knew he was feeding you a bit of outdated info-- so he threw those terms out there for you. Classical Econ was prevalent around 1770-1870, and was the mainstream school of thought. It was followed by Neoclassical Econ(perhaps you misheard him and he said ""neo"" instead of ""non"") as the predominant econ school of thought (which still dominates today). Considering Cost Centers vs Profit Centers appeared to be coined around 1945.. This really doesn't tie into the time frame of stemming from the Classical school.  I've not heard one person discuss cost vs profit centers in the real business world. Any Executive worth their salt will realize skimping on HR/Developers/etc, historical 'cost centers' will lead to losses.  Peter Drucker coined the term Profit Center. In 2002, Drucker said:    One of the biggest mistakes I have made during my career was coining the term profit center, around 1945. I am thoroughly ashamed of it now, because inside a business there are not profit centers, just cost centers   Page 129, Economics of Strategy (Besanko, Dranove, etc)- I apologize, I had to manually re-type this:   In-house divisions in many large firms serve as cost-centers that perform activities solely for their own firms and generate no outside revenue. An example of a cost center would be the laundry service in a hospital or the data processing department in a bank. Cost centers are often insulated from competitive pressures because they have a committed customer for their inputs. Moreover, it ca be difficult to evaluate the efficiency of cost centers because there is often no obvious market test for judging their performance. The absence of market competition, coupled with difficulties in measuring divisional performance, makes it hard for top management to know how well a cost center is doing relative to its best achievable performance. This in turn, gives cost center managers the latitude to engage in shirking behavior that cuts into corporate profits.   I think this leads into a discussion of compensation structures.  The metric for the sales team is bookings/funnel/retention of customers/etc. A sales team can immediately add top and bottom line revenue to a company. A sales person can attach revenue to their name, and get compensated for it.  The metric for developers is essentially: are they delivering the product (yes or no), are they delivering on-time/on-budget, is it of decent quality?  Quantifying how they are directly effecting top/bottom line is difficult. Yes, if there was no product-- there would be no revenue. But if a team doesn't perform or deliver, they would get replaced with new folks (the same also happens with the sales team that don't perform, or HR that makes bad hires, etc)."

Think of a mining company producing rubies.  If the business could make rubies appear out of thin air for free, they would.  All the machinery and labour used to produce those rubies is a cost against that ideal (and impossible) model.  Now, you could be really innovative, and invent a machine that mines these rubies in a super-efficient way, but you're still selling those rubies into the same ruby market, at the same ruby prices.     Now compare that to marketing.  Marketing could start an advertising campaign that changes the name.  These aren't rubies we're making, these are super love rubies.  These rubies come form a mine in Bora-Bora, and there's nothing more romantic than that.  Heck, these Bora-Bora rubies are more romantic than diamonds.  Maybe you should put these rubies in your engagement ring.  No, not those other rubies, they're not special.  These Bora-Bora rubies are the ones that'll impress her.    That kind of strategy, if successful, changes the market.  All of a sudden, you're not selling at the price of rubies, you're selling at the price of Bora-Bora rubies.  You've changed the market.    Apple didn't invent the GUI, the MP3 player, or the touchscreen smartphone.  They did, however, invent the markets for those devices.     Now, that's an example of product differentiation.  There are other ways marketing increases prices, through market segmentation, and other methods.  But the basic point is to act on the demand curve, whereas cost centers act on the supply curve.  Cost centers make stuff.  Profit centers make that stuff draw more revenue.  Both are important, and the company that stops innovating on the production side will find itself lagging behind.

AskSocialScience,32m73p,usrname42,2,Tue Apr 14 22:20:53 2015 UTC,"So let's start by looking at the equation of exchange:  ΔM+ΔV=ΔY+ΔP  Where ΔM is the rate of change in the money supply.  Where ΔV is the rate of change in the velocity of transactions.  Where ΔY is the rate of change in RGDP.  Where ΔP is the rate of change in price level.  In the short run, we can assume that the number of times a dollar turns over (ΔV, or the velocity of money) is close to zero.  This leaves us with:  ΔM=ΔY+ΔP which can be framed in terms of inflation by:   ΔP=ΔM-ΔY   Basically stated here is that the rate of change in the price level is a function of the difference between the rate of change in the money supply and the rate of change in production (GDP).  This identity basically tells us that the price level will increase if the rate of change in the money supply is GREATER than the rate of change in GDP growth.  So, second question: how does this translate to an increase in the price level?  With expansionary monetary policy, the central bank purchases financial assets from banks, injecting reserves directly into those banks.  Now, in theory (and MOSTLY in practice), this results in lower interest rates by way of an increase in the supply of loanable funds.  The quick and dirty of that is this: banks have more money to loan out, so they loan it at lower rates, which (again) TENDS to be true in the long run (not always in the short run, as there are behavioral responses that have to be taken in to account, as Janet Yellen has pointed out in the past).  ANYWAY, so look at the current situation: banks have more money to lend, and are lending at lower rates.  This eases the conditions by which people are able to borrow and spend money.  Cue an increase in aggregate demand.  Following that, and all things equal, cue an increase in the price level.  Hope that helps.  -Mishkin, F., 2013., Macroeconomics: Policy and Practice.

Draw a money diagram with M on the horizontal axis and 1/P on the vertical. Draw a downward-sloping money demand function. Draw an upward-sloping (or vertical) money supply function. Identify the equilibrium price level.  Suppose the central bank increases the money stock; shift the Ms to the right.  At the old equilibrium price level, there is now ""too much money chasing too few goods."" The price level adjusts downward until the market again clears a new, lower 1/P; that is, a new, higher price level.  Or write down a cash-in-advance model. An increase in M increases the supply of the medium of exchange, leading to an increased ability to purchase goods and services. Think of ""money"" as a ""GDP permit."" As firms see higher local demand (driven by the new, larger average cash balances) then they either increase prices or quantities or both.

Gregory Mankiw's ""Principles of Economics"" but I guarantee you they will all have a very similar first few chapters).  The short answer is they make more money by not selling now.  Corporations are rational (the extent to which this is true is debatable, but it's at least somewhat true and a very safe assumption for the purposes of this question) profit-maximizing enterprises.  If they are not cutting their losses by liquidating their assets now, there are two possible explanations: either a market doesn't exist and they are functionally incapable of selling (which isn't the case; regardless of the health of the market, there certainly still exists substantial supply and demand of housing), or they have the belief that their asset will appreciate over time at a rate greater than any other potential option (i.e. selling the house and investing the money elsewhere).

So, for example, to take a tree that has been growing in my yard and cut it down in order to sell the lumber would be s form of commodification. For Marxian theory, a commodity is a specific concept distinct from its everyday use that I explain more in this post  Reification is a form of alienation taken to the extreme and quite literally translates to 'making into a thing'. This applies to the process of objectifying both objects and social relationships. The example I like to give for a basic view of this is an example of Marx's notion of Fetishism. Fetishization for Marx is the act of allowing an object of your own creation to assume certain social or theological or economic power over you. So if we think of a tribe which worships wooden totems as representations of their deity then reification in this instance would be the process of bringing that totem into being by laboring to create it. Something which existed in the mind of a human is literally turned into an object. Fetishization occurs when you ascribe theological or social power to the totem. Commodity Fetishism, for Marx, is the act of ascribing human social power to inanimate objects like commodities.   This all wraps around to what I think you're asking about which I've heard termed  subject-object inversion. Subject-Object inversion is the reversal of the classic 'state of nature' thought experiments many philosophers were fond of using. In a Locke-style state of nature thought experiment you, the subject, go out and appropriate land, resources, and what not, the objects, and fashion those objects however you deem fit. Subject object inversion is the opposite and its easy to think of this in terms of a small business owner. Whether the business owner is the nicest or meanest person in the world is actually rather irrelevant when their business becomes unprofitable. They're forced by necessity to act in particular ways by cutting employees, raising prices, switching suppliers, etc. The reason they're forced to make that choice is because, according to Marx, capitalism as a mode of production requires constant accumulation. Why is basically the entirety of Capital volumes 1-3 so I'll just leave that at face value for now."

What they showed was that if agents have preferences that satisfy some axioms, they will maximize utility by maximizing expected utility when making decisions under uncertainty about the outcomes. It has nothing to do with constrained optimization. You can use those methods even if people aren't expected utility maximizers. VNM provided some tools for modeling choice under uncertainty. The axioms invoked are somewhat controversial among mainstream economists, particularly independence of irrelevant alternatives. They don't always hold up in real world experiments. I had no idea Austrians considered expected utility theory kosher. Especially since you go from ordinal to sort of cardinal utility when you start taking about expected utility. And considering VNM make use of indifference in their proof. Never heard any Austrians talk about this though.   It's true that there is no difference between Austrian value scales and the ordinal preferences mainstream economists assume when studying choice under certainty. Except Austrians always make the assumption of strict preferences (no indifference), even when it's superfluous.   Edit: I know I have to provide sources here, but I'm on my phone.

I'm not sure what the consensus among Austrian is.

AskSocialScience,32ce6v,TychoCelchuuu,40,Sun Apr 12 18:23:44 2015 UTC,"The biggest example is the charge that second wave feminism focuses far too much on issues that affect middle class white women and ignores (for instance) the challenges that face poor women, the challenges that face minority women, the way various kinds of oppression can intersect, and so on.  For instance, Betty Friedan's book The Feminine Mystique, one of the most influential works of second wave feminism, is basically an entire book about how women need to get middle class careers just like their husbands, because this will solve most of their problems. Instead of spending all their time cleaning the house and taking care of the kids, they should just hire people to do that uninteresting, tedious stuff, so that they can spend most of their time focused on fulfilling careers that until now have mostly been the domain of men.  There are a few issues here. For instance, who are you going to hire to clean your house and watch your kids? It's probably going to be poor women, especially poor women of color. If success for ""women"" is predicated on the continued oppression and lack of opportunities for poor women and women of color, this is a pretty sorry ""solution"" for the issues facing women. It's only a solution for the issues facing white women who can earn enough money in their careers to pay other people to do stuff. Moreover, what does it take to get a career just like the men? Well, you need education, you need a society that is not systemically racist and classist, and so on. Otherwise you're never going to get a career in the first place."

This was known as the ""peter meter"" and this was one of the rites of passage for induction into the fraternity.

AskSocialScience,32ce6v,queerbees,47,Mon Apr 13 22:57:59 2015 UTC,"As lots of folks have pointed out, the idea of waves is only useful insofar as it gives a broad, yet fictional, description of the history of feminism. Linda Nicholson argues that the usfulness of the wave metaphor for contemporary feminism (therefor, the usefulness of the term ""third wave"") has elapsed.    During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, feminism began to expand its meaning, including not only those who supported what many now think of as a liberal understanding of feminism, but also those who took this worldview in new directions. The 1960s through the 1980s was a period of great theoretical and political creativity and activity, making possible a very broad understanding of feminism. But after that kind of creative activity began to die down in the 1990s, people began to wonder whether or not we were in a third wave of feminism. The appeal of this way of thinking was that it kept up the hope that gender activism had not really died down but merely had taken a somewhat different, more youthful and jazzier form. But when I think about what has transpired in the period from the 1990s to today, I don't think that the metaphor of a third wave is the best way to describe what has gone on.   What happened, basically, is that there are a lot of very different trajectories and projects under the heading ""feminism,"" which makes the description of ""third wave"" misleading. (I would even argue that ""second wave"" is only narrowly useful to describe new activism that took place immediately after 1919.) There is ""too much"" feminism for there to be a ""third wave.""  And because a lot of this feminism is ""still in progress,"" trying to parse out what the ""third"" (or for some, ""fourth"") wave is not really a smart project.  A good example of the trouble that gets going with wave definitions can be seen in various attempts to highlight the break third wave feminism made from second wave. For some, the break occurred when feminists resisted or rejected gender/sex essentialism. Others say it is when race and sexuality entered the feminist equation. Some say it's sex-positivity, other postmodernism. What is remarkable is how many of these things highlighted are about us, now, rejecting or distancing ourselves from a previous generation of feminists. The second wave, in so many words, becomes a repository for the sins of ""other"" feminists, and its role as demarcating the historical turns in feminism obscures the diversity in (crypto)feminism before and after the start of the ""third wave."" Before, because it very often paints second-wave feminist all of the same stripe, and after because it makes it seem like those ""sins of the foremothers"" are in the past.  Keeping all that in mind, lol, I recommend that if you're conversing with folks over reddit (or anywhere), and they seem to make some pretty broad or confusing claims: ask for clarification. That is to say, ask who said X, what they think X means, and if its second hand, where they're getting their interpretation of X. Very often, it is in the details we will find the devils, whether fictions or real. Lots of feminists have lots of very different ideas, so know who they are and how they've articulated their selves is important to figure out what's going on.  Another thing is to pay attention to terms and arguments. I made this post (omg, 2 years ago!), In regards to the MRA term ""Patriarchy Theory"". Basically, I had noticed how much terms were twisted to fit into a particular argument being advanced by anti-feminists. In this case, ""patriarchy theory"" (serious, not a term ever used) is really a misunderstanding of what's going on in feminist discussions (it's not a ""theory"" it's a description). Terms and ideas will help you track back exactly what's going on.  Over all, it's paying attention to the whos, whats, terms, and ideas in a discussion that will better help parse what's being talked about by feminists and about feminists."

It seems evident that 'wave' is a bad description as it lumps all of feminism together as movement/group; might 'factions' be a worthwhile descriptor?  There are feminists who focus on intersectionality, on gender identity issues, on country or even state-specific legal inequality - and I'm personally fond of C.H. Sommers, who is generally regarded as anti-feminist though she calls herself a feminist.  It doesn't really help that there's no unifying definition of what 'feminism' is - even deciding if Feminism is about women's issues or gender equality is contentious.

Can someone explain to me each of the 'waves' as well as providing why they switched, the evidence for them and/or the current most-established paradigm/newest wave?   You can't define waves of feminism without defining who are and/or were feminists; you can't say why there was a switch without defining feminism; you can't really determine what is the 'newest wave' of feminism when the the different groups calling themselves feminist say the other ones aren't actually feminists and vice versa."
AskSocialScience,32ce6v,queerbees,4,Mon Apr 13 13:59:18 2015 UTC,"Well, yes, most of this is correct. We can't use the ""wave"" terminology because it is too narrow.  The only thing that's not quite right is the last part, ""'newest wave' of feminism when the the different groups calling themselves feminist say the other ones aren't actually feminists and vice versa."" The debates, within feminism, and between feminists and pseudo/anti-feminists aren't really part of a problem. It's just reality that there is this divergence of feminisms, and that in turn a fracturing of the movement. So it's not that the state of feminism doesn't ""help"" answer the OP's question, it's that the use of ""waves,"" or for that matter the idea of a ""newest,"" doesn't address anything helpful about feminism.  I think your point about about ""factions,"" is interesting. I do think it's much better to highlight what you're talking about in terms of feminism, when trying to present a feminist argument/idea. So, you might want to say queer feminism to talk about gender ambigioity and performativity, or lesbian feminism to talk about utopia, etc. But the thing with some kinds of feminism is that they are hardly factious. That is to say, they aren't doing anything.  For example, in the case of Christina Hoff Sommers, her ""feminism"" is not a practice, a movement, or an collective. Rather, it's her libertarianism which gives her motive, and in turn acts in opposition to various other feminist articulated movements and ideas. It's hard to call her a feminist because she doesn't do anything feminist. She's often called anti-feminist, because her writing on feminism betrays the deep conceptual and intellectual problems she has with contemporary feminism (though you wouldn't know it from her glossy pans). As an example, her gender/equity designations serve no purpose other than to demonize a lot of feminism and elevate (her) inaction to political merit. It flattens and distorts contemporary feminism, and in turn contributes to broad misunderstanding."

AskSocialScience,328uye,irisjunos,14,Sat Apr 11 17:03:55 2015 UTC,"Hey! I can answer this one. I presently work doing parent education/interaction, providing health information, and doing developmental screening for infants, toddlers, and prenatal mothers living below the federal poverty line. We're presently doing a pilot study to test an intervention to help lessen the gap between low income 8-to-10-month-olds (yes, the gap appears that early!) and their high SES peers.   There is a lot that is going on with the relationship between poverty and child development, so this is not a simple question.  Among them:  Parents of low income babies and children are more likely to be teen or early parents and are more likely to have maternal depression, a really strong predictor of negative outcomes for children.   Children in poverty have crappier nutrition, starting prenatally and continuing throughout their childhood. This not only leads to negative health outcomes (I have seen plenty of toddlers with literally black teeth, for example), but there is evidence that this leads to poorer cognitive functioning. Programs like SNAP and WIC help, but not as much as we wish they did. Children in poverty are much more likely to have nutrition-related problems like failure to thrive, iron deficiency, and asthma. Indeed, poverty is the greatest risk factor for failure to thrive. Early in life poverty is even predictive of risk of death.   The majority of children who suffer from things like lead poisoning are low income because it's the old, shitty houses whose landlords don't care that cost relatively little money and that have the potential for lead poisoning. Low income children are exposed to more pollutants in their air and water. They are also more likely to be exposed to things like tobacco smoke. I have even worked with toddlers who have lived right next door to people who smoke meth, which came into their house through the windows and vents and because mom couldn't afford a new place to live and the police didn't make an arrest... just... nothing happened. It was bad enough that I got physically ill the one time I was there when it happened, so I could only imagine what it was doing to a 14-month-old who was being chronically exposed.   Parents in poverty have less education (some of my families lack basic literacy) and often lack the time to appropriately respond to their children (working from 2-8am at Walmart and trying to find someone who will watch your two infants while you are gone can kind of fuck up the rest of your day). As a result, their households are more chaotic than their high SES peers.   Children in poverty not only are less likely to be read to and watch more TV, they have less access to things like books and computers. Some areas have programs for this, but mine does not. It's hard to read to your child if you can't afford books. Plenty of families I see only have the books that I bring them and our library has strict rules about who can use it-- meaning people who are not citizens (e.g. illegal immigrants) and people who live in neighboring towns that do not have libraries often can't access it. Furthermore, some of the areas where the lowest income people live are directly on the highway, where no public transportation can access them (and we have very limited public transportation anyways). They are there so that farmers who need field help can just go swoop them up as needed-- handy for getting a little bit of extra cash, not so handy if you want to access your doctor or a decent grocery store, since you can't exactly walk miles and miles down the highway with infants and toddlers in tow. (I live in a rural area and this is particular the area in which I live, but other types of barriers exist in all sorts of places.) Children in poverty also have fewer toys, which gives them fewer opportunities to learn, especially earlier in life. They also go to shittier daycares.   The relationship between childhood poverty and negative outcomes, including physical health, mental health, educational achievement, and so on is very robust. Unfortunately, we don't have a lot of causal research because that is difficult to do-- it's not ethical to randomly assign children to be poor, and you're ""hand a bunch of money to low income families and see if they do better"" is too expensive to anyone to fund it. There is a charity called Give Directly which posits that giving money to poor people so they can choose how to spend it is better than saying, ""Oh, I am going to buy XYZ for you because I think that is what you need."" You can read about their (pretty good) results here: http://www.princeton.edu/~joha/publications/Haushofer_Shapiro_Policy_Brief_2013.pdf   Given the number of negative things low income children experience, I would consider it to be quite to reach to conclude that the differences are because rich kids are inherently smarter.   The size of the benefit depends on what marker you are looking at... and also depends on what level of poverty you are looking at. ""In a shitty home with lead and no toys and no one really interacting with you much"" is still a lot better than ""literally starving to death"", which is how it is in certain other parts of the world. If we want to talk about exclusively American poverty + education, you can read a bit about the educational effects of poverty here: http://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/factsheet-education.aspx  Let me know if there's more info that will be helpful to you. :)"

I do have another question. Is there evidence regarding whether the effects of SES in behavioral and health outcomes are stratified, so to speak? For instance, as you brought up at the end, there are a lot of different levels of poverty, and it sounds like the links you posted here (although I haven't been through them yet) are all talking about a fairly extreme (by first world standards) level of poverty.   Do you think that the effect of SES on outcomes stops mattering after a certain point -- like, once basic needs are met, there isn't a benefit, or there's less of a benefit? For instance, maybe the size of the effect for going from poverty to middle class is like 5 standard deviations, but going from middle class to wealthy is like 0.5 standard deviations.   Or is it just a linear relationship -- more wealth, better outcomes?  Even so, there has to be an asymptote at some point, right?"
AskSocialScience,328uye,intangiblemango,3,Sat Apr 11 22:33:19 2015 UTC,"Most of what I linked here is typical to US poverty-- with a few that are based on more extreme poverty because the research does not exist to answer your questions for a Western population (e.g. Give Directly seemed to be pretty relevant to your question on what happens if you give people in poverty money, but, to my knowledge, they are the only group has done something like that). US poverty research typically uses the federal poverty line as the indicator of low income families, with extreme poverty (for the US, again), being less than 50% of the federal poverty line. The families that I work with, personally, all live below the federal poverty line and they fall anywhere within that range.  It is my opinion that meeting basic needs, which I would define as access to food, access to medical care, housing, etc. does not eliminate the gap between low income and high income children. Most of my families, and most families in poverty in general, do have those needs technically met (to the lowest possible standard-- the roof may leak with the landlord refusing to fix it, but they have a roof and a bed. Some people do struggle with certain needs, with things like infant formula being a really big issue when people run out of money-- people will dilute their formula to make it last longer which is obviously really bad). There is definitely a big difference between my families that are barely below the poverty line and my families that are way, way below it, though, and there would be an even bigger difference between those families and families who live outside of the US where starvation is a more pressing concern. However, I do agree that at some point having excess wealth would not make a difference. I would make an analogy to height-- we think of height as something that is primarily genetically determined, but that is only really true at higher income levels. We, as a society, have gotten taller in the last few decades because our nutrition has gotten better... and if you are malnourished, you won't reach your full genetic potential in terms of height. However, we wouldn't say that people 150 years ago, when people were four inches shorter on average didn't have their basic needs met, per se. It's more that you have to reach a certain point for that environmental impact to go away (and that point, in my opinion, is past the point of basic needs being met, at least when we talk about poverty).   Some of these questions are hard to answer though because causal research is just difficult to do with topics like SES. I can tell you my opinion based on my work with low income families and based on what the research says, but I can't give you a beautifully controlled study because we just don't have them."

Of course that doesn't show a causal relationship but it at least gets at the strength of the relationship, which is what I'm wondering about."

AskSocialScience,3263ns,Emperor_of_Cats,4,Fri Apr 10 22:04:49 2015 UTC,The democratic peace idea is the idea that democracies do not wage war on each other. Some political scientists think there is good evidence for this. See that link I posted for various bibliographical references.
AskSocialScience,3263ns,TychoCelchuuu,2,Sat Apr 11 03:15:22 2015 UTC,Hegemonic Stability Theory isn't exactly a theory of world peace but suggests a relatively peaceful international order where the hegemon supplies public goods. This IR theory is analogous to microeconomics theories of collective action.  Balance of power theories suggest that anarchy in the international order provides a systemic force that pushes states to achieve a balance or equilibrium of power that acts somewhat like the invisible hand of the market to secure a relatively peaceful international order.
AskSocialScience,3263ns,sangneuf,2,Sat Apr 11 05:48:11 2015 UTC,"While Kenneth Waltz's classic Man, the State, and War purports to be about the causes of conflict, I think it's better framed as a story about impediments to peace. It's an easy read, and well worth your time. The central thesis is that even if we all were to develop a sort of Kantian respect for one-another as equal, rights-bearing individuals, we would still find ourselves in conflict, because we have divided ourselves into distinct political communities and thus must compete as such over scarce resources, without any overarching authority to impose order.    Besides the Kantian response to this (as it's not a new claim, even if Waltz is very good at articulating it), which is to eventually hold out for one single worldwide state—though not quite the same as pax romana—there are perhaps three significant positions worth examining.    One is not too far off from the Kantian view: if you're am orthodox Marxist, you think that at some point we'll all overthrow global capitalism, reach the end of history, and live as a single communist polity in a state of harmony, for conflict (and, hence, history) is driven by class antagonisms and those will all be over at some point.    The second is democratic peace theory, already cited here in this thread. Kant sort of falls within this, but a more popular view in this tradition is to hold that regular people, perhaps under ideal circumstances, will all recognise that war is costlier than compromise and thus democratic states at odds will find peaceful solutions because policymakers know that war will not get them re-elected. Empirical questions aside, there is also an information gap that needs to get resolved, because as Gartzsky pointed out, war is in the error term—that is, war only ever happens because people aren't sure of their real chances to win. Though really, I should avoid offering an evaluation of these theories here...    The third is a sort of neoliberal institutionalist view, which is to take the same premises that underlie democratic peace theory and simply apply them to states alone, while 'black-boxing' the matter of domestic politics. The argument here is that once polities enter into stable and predictable relationships of exchange (managed by international institutions), they will prefer to maintain those relationships rather than destroy them, because this will lead to greater gain in the long run."

The ""Liberal"" school, at least traditionally, has been based around the idea that World Peace relies on successful institutions e.g. the UN  The Marxist camp sees the root of conflict in class conflicts, and as long as the bourgeoisie retain power then wars will continue.  (views on causes of war - the globalization of world politics, Baylis, Owens and Smith)  Moving onto some more focused scholarship, Fukuyama and Huntington (both US foreign policy academics), have had a debate around this rough idea:  Fukuyama, in ""the end of history?"", proposes the view that world peace could be achieved once the superiority of a capitalist democratic model of running a state was accepted. (fukuyama, end of history? - easy to find)  Huntington, however, sees the cause of conflict in a globalized world as the incompatibility of core values of certain ""civilizations"", in his book mainly the Islamic world and the West. As people become more aware of the plurality of culture in the world, they clan up to the people that share religious/historical links.

In fact, trying to classify any behaviour as primarily nature, or primarily nurture (e.g. 70% nature, 30% nurture') is ludicrous.    Behavior is the product of a complex interaction of experiences and genetics.  Neither nurture nor nature are sufficient.

Rather, baking bread is a complex interactions between the ingredients and the time in the oven, like behavior is a complex interaction of genetics and behavior.    Culture plays a part but so does genetics.  We know that testosterone tends to make people more aggressive and that men generally have more testosterone than women.   Thus, men should tend to be more aggressive than women.  The extent to which is shaped by societal and cultural norms along with other situational and genetic factors.

In fact, I might even suggest that if we looked at the VARIANCE in behaviour across individuals, more of the variance in behaviour would be a function of learned associations/cultural influences/etc. compared to genetic differences.  But to draw a line and say that cultural influences CAUSE everything we experience is insane.  Our genes set the template. The overlap of genes between different primates is pretty high.  Somewhere in the 90 - 96%, depending on the primate you are looking at.  That 4 - 10% difference changes the fundamental psychology.  Want within human evidence that we know that genes affect behaviour? Well, like I said, there's a number of genetic disorders that if you add a few genes or take away a few genes, it changes people in predictable ways.  Down Syndrome is the result of an extra chromosome 21 or that the deletion of 7 genes on chromosome 14 results in Prader–Willi syndrome.     Those are just obvious examples, but there is research with 8 month old babies that show that they make implicit judgments about liking those that are like them (and this can be something small like preferring the same snack as they do) and disliking those that are not like them.   Maybe not direct evidence of a genetic component but it points to an innate tendency to classify the world into us vs. them.  Does that mean that cultural influences don't play a part? No, of course not.  Who we learn to classify as our ingroup or outgroup is very highly dependent on those factors. Implicit and automatic attitudes are learned as a function of constant experience.    As for your quote about testosterone, that's interesting, thanks for pointing me to it.  Although when I tried to dig up the source, I found it was attributed to the handbook of crime correlates, which I couldn't access and thus couldn't evaluate.  That being said, if true, the following sentence ""Testosterone is only one of many factors that influence aggression and the effects of previous experience and environmental stimuli have been found to correlate more strongly. A few studies indicate that the testosterone derivative estradiol (one form of estrogen) might play an even more important role in male aggression - which points to a) like I said, environmental influences probably do play a greater role, and b) if not testosterone directly, then estradiol, plays a role.  So while I may have been wrong in implicating testosterone, if we use your source, then we still find a genetic component.  If we discount it, then you are simply picking and choosing the data you like best.  Also, when I typed it in to find, I also found this from wikipedia:   In nearly all species, there is an obvious disequilibrium between frequency and severity of aggression in males versus females.[32] Males are almost always the more aggressive sex and there are genetic differences that back up this observation. A common explanation for this phenomenon is the higher testosterone levels in males. Testosterone levels have a direct effect on neurotransmitter functioning contributing to physical aggression. Mutations affecting neurotransmitters, as stated above, are the dominanting cause of changes in aggressive behaviour. Another contributors to the unequal male-female aggression ratio are the sex-linked gene mutations that affect only male behaviour, such as MAO-A mentioned above. These mutations could be the reason why males are nearly always more aggressive than females, although, testosterone levels are a much more feasible explanation. Other evolutionary and genetic explanations of violent behaviour include: dopamine receptors mutations, DRD2 and DRD4,[8] that, when mutate simultaneously, are hypothesized to cause personality disorders, low serotonin levels increasing irritability and gloom[30] and the effects of testosterone[32] on neurotransmitter functioning to explain the increased occurrence of aggression in males.   So I'd be cautious interpreting Wikipedia as the ultimate source for truth."

Somewhere in the 90 - 96%, depending on the primate you are looking at. That 4 - 10% difference changes the fundamental psychology.   that's not what i'm saying, i'm merely staying agnostic whether bioligical/genetic factors affect human behavior. it's just that as far as we know there's good evidence only for the nurture side of things, when it comes to nature it's all very dubious, controversial and nebulous. so if we want to stay scientific we can't propose that there's some genetic effect or some mysterious interaction between the two at this point.    regarding percentages, it's just a matter of scale. it may seem like 4-10% is a small number but the essence of those 4-10 is insanely big difference.    Want within human evidence that we know that genes affect behaviour? Well, like I said, there's a number of genetic disorders that if you add a few genes or take away a few genes, it changes people in predictable ways. Down Syndrome is the result of an extra chromosome 21 or that the deletion of 7 genes on chromosome 14 results in Prader–Willi syndrome.      well that's a visible disorder, something that's very different from the majority of what you'd call ""normal"" humans. we're obviously talking about properly working human brain ""hardware"".      Those are just obvious examples, but there is research with 8 month old babies that show that they make implicit judgments about liking those that are like them (and this can be something small like preferring the same snack as they do) and disliking those that are not like them. Maybe not direct evidence of a genetic component but it points to an innate tendency to classify the world into us vs. them. Does that mean that cultural influences don't play a part? No, of course not. Who we learn to classify as our ingroup or outgroup is very highly dependent on those factors. Implicit and automatic attitudes are learned as a function of constant experience.     innate propensities do not prove your point, maybe identifying between us in them is similar to the ability to acquire language for example. you have to show some variance here, ie, some babies do not do it. plus it doesn't seem like at 8 months you can talk about innate traits, quite a bit of socialization happened already.    regarding wiki i merely showed that what you believed is true not scientifically unchallenged, as you presented it as some obvious truth. the studies that do claim to have found some genetic effect can be always easily challenged with the fact that they don't control for all the relevant social variables, i've spent hours arguing with so called ""scientific racists"" and it's always the same (of course they simply disregard anything remotely sociological and anthropological so naturally they don't even understand this argument, but that's way off topic)"

AskSocialScience,3232dz,dust4ngel,3,Fri Apr 10 05:12:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks! /u/dust4ngel!  I think that might be what I am looking for. However, from reading the wiki, it seems that veblen goods face increased demand at higher prices due to the social status associated with purchasing them and the exclusivity of the transaction (i.e. a $70,000 Patek Watch would face more demand than a $50,000 Rolex because a: less people own the Patek due to its price, making it more exclusive and thus more valuable and b: you can show all the Rolex plebs you can afford a $70,000 patek). So with Veblen goods the increased price of the product increases the social status assoiciated with the item, and because the purchasers are paying for the social status of the product, the more expensive one (with the higher social status) faces more demand.   However, I am wondering whether there is a term for when the increased price actually tricks purchasers into buying a product because they use ""higher price higher quality"" logic.   For example, a non-tech savvy individual whom wants to buy a smartphone is looking at wither a $1000 Samsung or a $600 Sony phone (these phones have similar specifications, but the purchaser, not being technologically inclined, does not understand this). The purchaser then buys the Samsung phone because he believes that it must have $400 more value than the Sony phone. Therefore the larger price actually tricked the purchaser into thinking the item was of a higher quality, thus increasing that items demand.   Is there a word for that? (or is Veblen still appropriate?)"
AskSocialScience,3232dz,not_karma,1 point,Fri Apr 10 08:12:34 2015 UTC,"from the ""See also"" section in the Veblen:  Positional good   Positional goods are a subset of economic goods whose consumption (and subsequent utility), also conditioned by Giffen-like pricing, depends negatively on consumption of those same goods by others.[1] In particular, for these goods the value is at least in part (if not exclusively) a function of its ranking in desirability by others, in comparison to substitutes. The extent to which a good's value depends on such a ranking is referred to as its positionality.   Also linked in the ""See also"" section of Veblen:  Giffen good   In economics and consumer theory, a Giffen good is a product that people consume more of as the price rises—violating the law of demand. For any good, as the price of the good rises, the substitution effect makes consumers purchase less of it, and more of substitute goods; for most goods, the income effect (due to the effective decline in available income due to more being spent on existing units of this good) reinforces this decline in demand for the good. But a Giffen good is so strongly an inferior good (being more in demand at lower income) that this contrary income effect more than offsets the substitution effect, and the net effect of the good's price rise is to increase demand for it."

This is the current situation, links on there for prior year estimates.   Is the regional distribution of wealth much fairer now than it was in 1900?   Yes, but also different.

Over the last half a century growth in developing economies has been a great deal faster then in advanced economies, worldwide inequality has fallen massively.  One small caveat is that its not really useful thinking about wealth or income distribution in terms of shares as neither are zero-sum, one group of people (either demographically or geographically) having $n or n% of income doesn't preclude another group from having $n also.

AskSocialScience,31zw7c,tootie,2,Thu Apr 9 22:24:20 2015 UTC,"Sorry, that wasn't that clear.    I mean, there are some people who are unemployed, but only because they are unwilling to take certain jobs (e.g. an engineer may not be able to get a job in his/her industry but could probably get a job at McDonalds, if they wanted to).  Thus they are unemployed but not due to a lack of jobs per se.  Also, I looked up labor force participation rate and found this:   A measure of the active portion of an economy's labor force. The participation rate refers to the number of people who are either employed or are actively looking for work.   However, this doesn't tell me exactly what I want to know.    Basically, what I want to know is, assuming everyone who is looking for a job takes whatever job they can get, how many people are 'left-over.'     Or said another way: are there enough jobs to go around if everyone took some job? and if not, how many people would be 'left-over' when every job was filled.    Note: this assumes there are too many overqualified people but I suppose it should also include under-qualified people as well.  In other words, let's assume, for the purposes of this question, that everyone who is currently unemployed is randomly assigned to a job that is currently being advertised.   I guess the final equation would be:  Labor force participation rate = total jobs currently available + X   I want to know what X is.   My gut says it is a positive integer (which means that even if everyone took some job, there would still be people 'left over')"
AskSocialScience,31zw7c,CombustionJellyfish,4,Thu Apr 9 15:59:47 2015 UTC,"Ok, to figure out your question, it sounds like you want something akin to:  Unemployed People - Available Job Offerings = Desired Figure  For the former, you may want to use U3, U4, U5, or U6 unemployment to tailor your definition better.  You can see their definitions (and current rate) here  For the latter, the BLS does put out a monthly job opening report here.  You can use Job Openings - Job Hirings to estimate the total number of unfilled job openings at the end of the month  So to answer your question based on the above, there were 5,133,000 job openings and 4,916,000 hirings, leaving roughly 217,000 openings unfilled.  The U3, the smallest and most strict of the unemployment metrics from above, tells us that roughly 8,600,000 people were unemployed, or about 40x the number of people looking as there are unfilled offerings.  The U6 is about twice the U3, so roughly 80x for that metric.  Note that this is not exact, but it is accurate enough to say that there are many more people unemployed than there are unfilled jobs.  Also note though that there is a kind of natural level of unemployment even in boom times as people are temporarily between jobs for any number of reasons.  Since I've just kind of clodged this together, I don't know how this metric would look historically, but you could put it together with BLS data pretty easily.  Edit: Looking more closely at the Job Openings figure, you may not need to deduct the job hirings. (I haven't used the job openings report before.)  This would substantially reduce the ratio but would not change the conclusion that there are more people looking for jobs than there are available job openings."

Math seems a little wonky here. The reason I say that can be found here. What it says is:   There were 5.1 million job openings on the last business day of February...   And then it says:   There were 4.9 million hires in February, about the same as in January...   That doesn't mean there are only 200,000 or so spots open. What that means is, that 4.9 million people were hired throughout the month, and 5.1 million openings were left over.  What that also means, then, is that when people talk about this they note that openings are up while hiring is down: not that hiring has closed up all openings. So when we take U3, and put all of the unemployed into the job openings, we get a jobs shortage of around 3.5 million; not a deficit of 8.4 million."

As such you should be subtracting U3 from openings rather then also subtracting hirings. This gives us a figure of ~-3.5m You did indeed note that U3 includes frictional unemployment, while we can estimate this using a mixture of household surveys and JOLTS data an easy way of accounting for most of frictional employment is just to ignore unemployment <5 weeks. This brings us down to ~-1m."

In other words, the total jobs offered now is some function of expected demand for stuff given who is working now. If you forced people to take jobs, demand for stuff would probably go up, so more jobs would be offered. Someone has to make the new stuff that people would want to buy with the wages you forced them to earn.   And maybe you are already all over this, but unemployed means they lack a job but are looking. It's sort of a weird measurement because you literally ask someone 'are you looking for a job'.

There's some things that need fixing (bridges, roads, dams) and some people with the skills to fix it.  Further, there's demand to fix it, at least above and beyond, the demand for other things that money is being spent on, and yet there's people in those industries, unemployed.. But I do see what you are saying.  That being said, that's not really my question, or more specifically, it's because total jobs is thought to be at an equilibrium outcome, that I am interested in what that means for those who are unemployed / what that means for our society as fewer people are needed to produce the same amount.

I'm not sufficiently important in my discipline to change vocabulary.   You are correct that holding demand constant while improving productivity will decrease employment. But why would you hold demand constant when you change income (employment affects income)? We usually think of demand depending on prices and income. Productivity tends to change both.   The Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson is a good sci-fi book about what society may look like as most goods become free or just super cheap. The price trends are pretty clear - most stuff gets cheaper.

AskSocialScience,320pym,Vladith,3,Thu Apr 9 18:32:56 2015 UTC,"If economic globalization can be thought of as imperialism, then the IMF/World Bank structural adjustment conditionality programs could fit your definition.  Good governance, sustainable development, and human rights provisions may also meet your definition. These again have commonly been included in IMF/World Bank agreements with developing countries/emerging economies.  Although the US is commonly associated with these ""Washington Consensus/neo-liberal"" policies, European countries have even greater control of these institutions.  Moreover, the EC/EU have perpetrated much more direct ""imperial"" or possibly more ""hegemonic"" actions through EU enlargement and the Lome/Cotonou Conventions. I say direct because the EC/EU is more supranational than the shared intergovernmental responsibility of the Bretton Woods institutions which are more indirectly imperial by comparison.  If you want to pursue this path, check out:  Stone, Controlling Institutions: International Organizations and the Global Economy; Gruber, Ruling the World: Power Politics and the Rise of Supranational Institutions; and Woods, The Globalizers: The IMF, the World Bank and Their Borrowers."

Although when I look at the chart half way down, there are some interesting blips.  Native americans and Alaskans do get more college funding though scholarships (10.8% of people in that group receive a private scholarship) as compared to whites (6.2%) or Blacks (4.4%).  What is a really neat thing to explore however are biracial folks; 8.1% of them receive private scholarships.    Biracial folks don't often have programs and nonprofits committed to them, so what is going on there?  My conjecture: they can apply to a wider swath of opportunities and they are well versed in ""code switching"" articulating the perspective of one of their racial/cultural experience to the other highly effectively.  This would make for an excellent education/sociology study.    http://www.finaid.org/scholarships/20110902racescholarships.pdf  In raw numbers, however, white folks represent 61% of the student population, but command 69% of the scholarships where blacks represent 14% of the student pop, but only receive 11% of scholarships.  For Latinos, it is more severe: 14% of student pop, 9% of whom receive scholarships.

AskSocialScience,31wq76,graaahh,45,Wed Apr 8 19:25:40 2015 UTC,"Asexual people are relatively rare. A study in the UK found that approximately 1 out of 100 people are asexual (Bogaert, Anthony F. (2004). ""Asexuality: prevalence and associated factors in a national probability sample"". Journal of Sex Research 41 (3): 279–87).  To get a large probability (random) sample would be difficult.  So to find 100 asexual people to ask about body image in a phone survey, you'd have to get 10,000 to answer the phone and agree to answer questions. That's a lot of people and I can't think of an easy way to ""over sample"" asexual people. And you'd have to call MORE than that because response rates for telephone surveys are fairly low (so if it were a 50% response rate, we'd have to call 20,000 people to find 100 asexual people to ask about body image). 100's not a horrible subsample for social stats though. The problem really only comes since body dismorphia itself is relatively rare (also around 1%), if it were completely absent from our subsample of 100 asexual people and present in 99 out of 9900 non-asexual people, we wouldn't know if this was due to random chance or if it was because the rate were really lower (if body dismorphia were noticeably higher among asexual people in real life, that might be easier to pick up in our random sample of 100 asexuals), ie. we'd need even bigger samples to answer this with survey methods.   I'm not saying this work hasn't been done or can't be done, or that there are no studies that could weigh in on this (especially from convenience samples of people in treatment for body disphoria), but I'm saying it would not surprise me if there were no good data on this available just because of sample size issues. Compounding that, because of privacy things, it's rare for surveys that focus on questions about sexuality to become publicly available. The only one I can think of is National Health and Social Life Survey, and I don't know if they ask about body dismorphia. Large sample surveys, like the General Social Survey or the World Values Survey or the various Pew Surveys, I don't think have asked questions about body dismorphia, either. If one survey did, it would be ADD HEALTH, but I don't think that likely has a large enough sample size to give you the answer even if you did have access to it.   It's an interesting question, with an interesting hypothesis, but ones that's difficult to test by normal survey methods. Experimental methods might be able to test broader claims about response to body image stimulus (indeed, even the large surveys might be able to do something based on ""mean body image"" or something because then we'd would be able to leverage the statistical power of the full sample of asexuals surveyed), but actually getting into the pathology would be difficult because both conditions are so rare in the general population.   Edit: I was playing around with a z-test calculator and if it's 1/100 in the general population, even if it was only a quarter as likely in the asexual population, if we had a sample of 40,400 people, of which 400 were asexual, 401 had body dismoprhia, and only 1 out of the 400 asexualls had body dismorphia (that is, 1/4 of the general rate, which is substantively a big difference and probably more different than I'd expect), we still wouldn't be able to say with standard significance levels (.05) that the two were different, even doing a one-tailed test! (It would be a significant difference at the .10 confidence level if we were running a one-tailed test, but in most social research I've seen people are really reluctant to run one-tailed tests even when it's theoretically justified, so you might still have trouble getting this result passed peer review)."

Here, however, asexuality is basically our ""treatment"" so to make inferences about the general population, we'd really want a random sample. There are some alternative we could try and use for a non-random sample (like propensity score matching) but it's not easy, and with such a rare ""treatment"" and a rare ""effect"", we still run into a lot of issues of statistical power.

Getting a sample through an organization or support group will probably give you a sample that's richer, more educated, and whiter than the population at large. It also gives you people who are engaged with their asexuality in a certain way. Such a convenience sample can start to give you an idea about the relationship between variables in a population, but it's hard to make inferences about a larger population based on it.

I went through them a bit when I was looking for good overviews of the Becker v. Arrow v. Statistical Discrimination...  http://economics.mit.edu/files/553  http://economics.mit.edu/files/4095  Autor suggests that most researchers are less interested in the Beckerian model (employers have a ""preference"" for discrimination) because an observed wage gap is sufficient but not necessary for it to be occurring.   The following from a JPE paper was trying to revive the Becker model and (restates) the conditions for when wage gaps will occur and when discrimination will be costly for employers.  Intuitively, if there are a small number of discriminating employers, the market just self segregates and the gap disappears (with CRS).  But if more people are discriminating, a wage gap can arise, and it will be costly to employers who discriminate.   Relationship between racial tastes and the relative wages and relative supply of blacks and whites. The figure shows how the equilibrium ratio of black to white wages responds to three sets of market conditions. When the relative supply of black workers is small relative to the number of unprejudiced employers, as is the case when supply is as depicted by S1, the marginal discriminator is unprejudiced and there is no racial wage gap in equilibrium. When the distribution of racial preferences among employers is held constant, a shift out in the relative supply of black workers (from S1 to S2) requires that more prejudiced employers hire blacks, and the ratio of black to white wages falls from one to R. When the relative supply of black workers is held constant, an increase in prejudice among employers likely to be the marginal discriminator (which causes the relative demand curve to rotate from ABD to ABD′), further reduces the equilibrium ratio of black to white wages to R′.

I would argue the reasons for this are complex and vary from case to case,  but looking into research on countercultures might help elucidate reasons individuals might defy gender norms.  Edit for clarity: at birth we are given biological gender (to oversimplify), and we have scripts that fit male bodies and female bodies.

Butler says ""there is no gender identity behind the expressions of gender; that identity is performatively constituted by the very ‘expressions’ that are said to be its results"" (Gender Trouble 34). Most people think that women and men act in certain ways because they are women and men. Butler is saying that people are women and men because they act in certain ways: to be a woman or to be a man is to fit a certain script and to do certain things.  To be non-conforming is just to fail to act according to the script people expect you to act according to. Butler says that gende is ""impossible to separate out from the political and cultural intersections in which it is invariably produced and maintained"" (Gender Trouble 4-5) which explains why people would expect you to act according to one or another script.

Agreeing with Foucault, she argues that that there is not some deep down pure gender or desire that is oppressed or twisted by society.  All there is the performance of gender, desire and the self.   Because of this, there is no degrees of performance. All there is is performance. Straight cisgendered and gay trans both exist totally as performance. Neither is more or less authentic. There is no criteria beneath performance by which to judge performance. What Butler would say is that queerness can be transformative because it can unsettle traditional gender norms and the oppression those norms entail. However, queer subversion is still performance.

For example as a linguist I deal with a large amount of statistical analysis or large data sets, often using things like R or Python to work out some of the more complex stuff. I also regularly deal with acoustical analysis looking at how changes in air pressure cause changes in the fundamental frequency of speech.  This latter area, acoustic phonetics it's called, is very much hard science in the traditional sense. You should see some of the setups we're using. There are branches of linguistics that are less like that. Sociolinguistics for example.   But then as others have asked, what is science? The social sciences follow the same scientific method as the hard sciences. You come up with a hypothesis and you test that against large amounts of experimental data, and then you refine your hypothesis and begin again, attempting to find an explanation for a very real situation. The same core approach is followed just as closely in linguistics as it is in chemistry, for example. If science is defined even in part by research through experimentation to better understand the world around us, then clearly this qualifies.  I don't really see the point in drawing this line around ""Science"" as this loftier thing. The social sciences are still incredibly important, just as challenging (if not more in some ways) and producing just as much useful contribution to human knowledge through study. And isn't that what ""science"" means to begin with?  It's understandable that the ""soft sciences"" get a little touchy about the label. People are quick to dismiss them and in some cases malign them, especially coming from a lot of people in the STEM fields (on Reddit, mostly. I rarely actually see this happening in person). So it makes sense that some people in the social sciences are pushing to be recognised as more along the lines of the hard sciences, but I think that's a problem with the premise that there is such a line in the first place.

Some people (like /u/keyilan and /u/OptionK) suggest that anything that follows the scientific method is science. This is almost certainly false. Many scientific endeavors do not follow the scientific method, if by scientific method we mean ""you come up with a hypothesis and you test that against large amounts of experimental data, and then you refine your hypothesis and begin again, attempting to find an explanation for a very real situation"" (as /u/keyilan puts it). If you investigate the way various scientists make discoveries (especially scientists in biology) they often fail to conform to the method. This article sums up various considerations about scientific discovery that suggest that ""whoever follows the scientific method"" is not going to be a good label to tell us who is doing science. (One of the most famous attacks on what he calls the ""tyranny of method"" is made by Feyerabend, and this is summed up in this section of this article.)  I am not a philosopher of science, and I'm not qualified to make up my mind on the question of demarcation, since it's still an open and debated topic, but the answer I am partial to is a social criterion, according to which we determine what science is by looking at what we think science is, what scientists do when they think they are doing science, etc. I'm sure you can imagine many reasons that people would be unhappy with this answer, but there turn out to be reasons to be unhappy with many other answers, too.  On the demarcation problem in general, see:  Ruse, Michael. ""Creation Science is not Science."" Science, Technology, and Human Values (1982): 72-78.  Laudan, Larry. ""The Demise of the Demarcation Problem."" Physics, Philosophy and Psychoanalysis. Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science Volume 76, 1983, pp 111-127.  and I could give you more references if you want.  On social science specifically I don't really have any citations handy. One place to start:  Open the Social Sciences: Report of the Gulbenkian Commission on the Restructuring of the Social Sciences (1996).  In any case, I don't know if it's worth worrying about whether social science is a science. Who gives a shit? It turns out that most arguments over whether social science is science or not either turn out to be a pointless waste of time, or they turn out to be arguments about something different, in which case it would be much clearer to state that we are arguing about that different thing rather than having to solve the problem of what science is."

I actually think biology is a pretty good parallel for linguistics. In nearly every way that's significant to the layperson, there's an overlap. The imagined line between species, speciation, observing a complex natural system and trying to work out how it does what it does, typological endeavours and the like.  At any rate I'm pretty comfortable with the idea that biology is not a science if we are to assume that there actually is some objective way to make that call.

The social sciences use the scientific method (at least in general, I don't mean to foreclose the possibility of some weird exception existing).

AskSocialScience,31ux5m,OptionK,3,Wed Apr 8 14:49:08 2015 UTC,"In case it's at all unclear, I'm proposing that using the scientific method is a sufficient condition for constituting a science. Whether it is a necessary condition need not be addressed here.   Though as a proposed criteria, detached from other issues, it is an acceptable definition---insofar as any definition is acceptable. But I think the point is that we (the social ""we"") do not treat adherence to the scientific method as sufficient to make something a science. This has been explored in, for example, in Harry Collins work on parapsychology, in which despite the application said method, it was the conflicts in interpretation that determined its scientificity.  But probably more apt to your point is the fact that it would seem that only a scientific experiment can be ""scientific"" (that is, if it follows the scientific method), and not other ""things"" that are typically have scientific attribution (theories, disciplines, etc). For example, ""scientific medicine"" would not be science: medical practice does not fit into the scientific method.  I think that, in a non-trivial way, what is and isn't a science is very much a social thing (how serendipitous for social studies!). Science is not ""arbitrary,"" but at the same time it's not fixed or essential. Recognizing the role a (or the) scientific method plays in the determination of whether something is a science or not is probably something we should pay attention to. But in an interesting way, the question of whether social science is a science (as proposed by the OP) opens up the larger question of how very constructed ""science"" is itself. I think /u/keyilan answer actually articulates a lot of the social determinants of ""science,"" like the application of statistical techniques, use of computer programs, methods, etc... But most importantly, it's the recognition that things can be ""sciencey,"" which keys us into how not clear the designation of ""science"" is."

AskSocialScience,31qd8l,jarviscoca,5,Tue Apr 7 19:41:47 2015 UTC,"By definition, a service economy could exist without any industrialization at all.  Industrialization and service based are not mutually exclusive. Industrialization is, in its most basically explained form, according to general economic theory, where technological growth outpaces population increases. Service-based is a descriptor of where investments are being made.  ""Increasing the economy"", by which I assume you mean increasing GDP, can be done by investment in any goods and services. Investment in capital goods (manufacturing and production) is more conducive to long term sustainable growth than consumer based goods (according to general theory).  So, the question needs to be rephrased. Either:  ""Can an economy become service based without first being manufacturing based"" The answer is, of course, yes. All people have to do is choose consumer based activity over manufacturing based activity.  OR  ""Would a service based economy develop without first investing in industrial manufacturing goods?"" The answer is also, of course, yes. Almost every nation you see that has no industrial manufacturing capability is, by definition, a consumer goods and services oriented economy, because they aren't investing in capital goods much at all.  The point being, you can choose to go wherever you please. Industrialization is a powerful change in economics, any developing economy would benefit from it. Manufacturing is better for long term GDP growth (according to Austrian theory)."

AskSocialScience,31qpma,rumpus_room,12,Tue Apr 7 12:39:14 2015 UTC,"Only for social science research into the choices people make when they are deciding via UNUM or some other social swarming tool.  As has been observed in tons of studies, the behavior of people depends in a large part on what they perceive the behavior of other people to be, so the decisions people make in this sort of ""swarming"" context is probably very different from the decisions they would make in a non-aggregated context. Thus, we can't take the choices people make when swarming to be representative of what choices they think are best, full stop, or anything like this.  We certainly can't take the behaviors they instantiate while swarming to be representative of the behaviors they would instantiate in other contexts.  Meanwhile, the reason we poll people is to find out what their opinions on various things are, and since we should expect that the swarming context will alter the answers people give, it seems like swarming would just distort the answers that we would want to get from polling by getting everyone to come to a consensus they likely would not have come to without the social pressure of being part of a swarm.  Notice how the swarm decided eHarmony was the best dating site, this despite eHarmony only allowing heterosexual relationships. Someone who might on their own be inclined to care about homosexual rights and so on might lean towards OKCupid, but given evidence that other people don't give a shit about non-hetero relationships, people might tend to abandon whatever support they would have given to OKCupid, thinking (rightly? wrongly? you decide) that they were wrong to give a shit about this sort of thing.

Yes, China's levels of extreme poverty declined dramatically in recent decades. World Bank estimates 80% of China was extremely poor in 1980, but now that's in the single digits. More people were lifted out of extreme poverty in China in the past 25 years than the rest of the world combined.    And no, because China still has a very, very large number of people who are still poor. Gini Index quantifies this. If all of the wealth were in one person's hands, the Gini Index would be 1. If all of the wealth were shared evenly (Maotopia), the Gini Index would be 0. China's Gini index was an extremely high .5 in 2010. This means that China's development involves getting almost a billion people from extremely poor to plain old poor, and then also creating a billionaire millionaire plain old wealthy upper class, with not that much in the middle (although the most recent trend is towards balancing, as of 2011 there were still 800 million who were making less than $5/day--see http://databank.worldbank.org/data/views/reports/tableview.aspx )."

Yeah, working so hard at it... that's why taxes are so low on the rich, that's why government members throughout the country are incredibly rich while the people suffer. The culture of ""Guanxi"" basically ensures the poor are left behind while the rich get VASTLY richer.   I understand you are from China and have grown up surrounded by a single entity which controls your media and politics and so you trust them, but you need to do your research a little better to see just how badly your government is screwing over your people and your future. China's rise could be handled in a sustainable way that could ensure China actually took it's place among the most powerful countries of the world, but as it is right now your government and corporations are draining your treasury and future hope and sending it abroad to where their families live and where they will flee to when things go bad. I hope for the best for you and China, but until people like yourself actually properly study the issues going on and stop just accepting CCP propaganda as facts, you're country is screwed."

AskSocialScience,31oimq,Exexexpat,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:18:50 2015 UTC,"How do the govt tax them?   Tax their earnings, both salary and investments. China is currently mimicking the USA's economic ideals and pretending in what is called ""Trickle Down Economics"". This is the idea that the rich have to get rich and then they will spend the money and improve the rest of the country. This economic ""theory"" has long been ridiculed among all of the educated world as a joke the rich keep telling to the uneducated to try and pretend greed is good. Money doesn't trickle down, money always flows up. If you want a strong economy you give the money to the poor nad middle class and they buy goods and services, stimulating demand which in turn pushes the rich to increase supply and this creates more jobs and a stable economy. I hope China and the Chinese people learn just how massive of a lie the West and the CCP has been feeding them before it's too late. China is following the USA's economy lead and the USA's economy is completely unsustainable and dying fast.   And most impotantly, many rich ppl migrate to other countries in fear that the govt will tax them heavily in the near future, if the govt really try different ways to tax them, then a lot of money will flow out the country and a lot of rich ppl flee, then what will happen to the poor ppl in the country? less jobs, even more poorer   That's already happening. the proper method of stopping it isn't to lower taxes, it's to make taking money out of China illegal or HEAVILY taxed so if they want to flee the country they can but they leave behind a very large portion of their cash. Instead the government has allowed the rich to flood the West with money through a gaping hole in Macau due to the financial system set up there which has enabled hundreds of billions of dollars to flee China every year and the Chinese government has still not fixed the problem. They said they would, repeatedly. And yet strangely they continue to allow it. It's almost like they let it happened because they and their friends are using it to steal China's money and setting up their families abroad for when things go to shit in China again... Almost...   and you still don't tell me how to make the poor ppl rich?   I'm not saying make them rich, I'm saying give them enough to survive and improve their life. If I give a poor person 2000RMB, they'll spend it all on food, hobbies, housing, transportation and more. This greatly improves the economy and keeps supply and demand growing and the jobs increasing. If I give a rich person 2000rmb they stick it in their bank or in their investments which boosts the economy to a small extent but no where near to the level as having free flowing money in the economy does.    ask the capitalists to pay them more? that will only lead to bankrupt of many small business owners and lead to a lot of unemployment.   Sorry but that fails on two levels. First, if you increase salaries to a point where people can afford a house, food and some niceties, you don't have a downturn in jobs because the increased buying power of the lower and middle class (the ones that drive the economy) greatly increases demand for products. This will increase corporate profits and increase the need for more businesses. When a country goes into a recession you don't cut jobs and salaries, you do whatever you can to INCREASE spending. That's what raising salaries of the poor does.   Secondly, Internal demand for products and services is EXACTLY what China needs as well, so it can stop relying so heavily on exports tied to the faltering US and European economies. If China wants to have a future it must increase it's own internal consumption to the point where China's economy can maintain itself. As it is now it needs the USA and Europe to keep buying products in order to keep the jobs increasing, and the USA and EUrope can no longer afford to do so which will destroy China's economy and will almost certainly lead to massive civil unrest among the poor."

If you're talking about only that, be aware that a judiciary committee cannot reject a bill after it has already passed. In general, when a bill gets proposed it is sent to the appropriate committee, whose chairman will schedule votes, hearings, etc. on it. Bills that go to the judiciary committee, at least nationally, include proposed amendments to the Constitution, among other things. When a bill gets there, the committee must decide whether or not to amend it, the chairman can decide not to bring it up, they can vote it down and reject it, etc., and it being ""unconstitutional"" can be one of the reasons it gets shut down.  In the national system, bills can rarely get to the floor for debate with a chairman in opposition. There is one way, using a ""discharge petition"", which requires half of the entire chamber of Congress it's proposed in to sign on, that can do it. But it's rare.  Does this help answer your question? If you talk about a specific state I can help, because states have different rules for their legislatures (for example, Nebraska has a unicameral legislature). But generally judiciary committees don't rule a bill unconstitutional, they choose whether or not to pass it. Courts rule things unconstitutional. If a law would be inconsistent with a state's constitution, the judiciary committee can say so, but they don't rule on laws already passed as far as I know.

If you took a time machine and went back to ancient China/Greece to speak to these men, they wouldn't identify themselves as homosexual, because it's not a concept that exists in that time and space. Labeling the acts or the men as homosexual gives connotations of modern/Western homosexuality that were not present in that culture.   The distinction may seem unimportant for everyday use, but there are situations where it can be useful. An example is that in Brazil, a man who has sex with a travesti may not consider it a homosexual act. This can make it difficult for medical workers to assess HIV risk, because those men would deny any homosexual contact.

I argue that even if you don't personally identify with being part of the gay community there now exits a construct for the world to pigeon hole you into and ascribe an identity onto you.  An example of this is how in some cultures 2 men holding hands has no kind of implications about your sexual orientation, but in my culture (the United States) walking down the street with your male friend holding hands is going to absolutely make other individuals shoehorn you into the social construct of homosexual.  Is it gay to hold hands with someone of the same gender? Is it gay to kiss someone of the same gender? Is it gay to sleep naked with someone of the same gender?  Is it gay to touch genitals of someone with the same gender? Is it gay to platonically love someone of the same gender but only jerk off together and not put one of your dicks in the other one's butt? I think you'll find these questions difficult to find consistent answers to across different individuals and cultures.  There has always been awareness that acts of homosexuality existed. It is only recently that a (shifting) line was drawn in the sand that makes someone a different category of person because they engage in some of these acts.  The problem with this way of thinking in my opinion is that is severely limits the spectrum of ways people can interact with each other and makes us afraid that we will be put into this category even if we don't ourselves in it.  I don't consider myself gay. I've never had sex with a man. But I would totally snuggle with my male friends. I would love to have a life partnership with a man where we buy a house together and live as domestic partners but don't (nescessarily) have sex and are open to have sex with other people, whether they be male or female. This is not something I can talk about with men at all (except known gay men) because the listener starts to get uncomfortable that having the conversation or even entertaining the thought makes them gay.

To go further down the path you are taking this conversation; Ok. So you are saying that if anyone has EVER had 1 single feeling of sexual attraction to someone of the same sex that makes them gay officially? This is your personal criteria for qualifying someone into this social construct and is by no means absolute   The whole point (that you are obviously not going to try to understand, but I'm hoping this may be helpful for someone else out there confused about their sexuality) is that being gay is absolutely not something that you become when you engage in a specific act and that there is no specific criteria for when someone becomes gay via homoerotic action.  It's something that you become (in your mind) when you choose to identify with it, or become in the minds of others when others choose label you with this identity. This is exactly what a social construct is.  Again, I don't expect this to reach you but for my own enjoyment I'm going to delve a little deeper here. I think your big hangup is that you think that someone saying that something is a social construct means it doesn't exist. Being gay exists now that people have created it as a construction but it hasn't always.   Another hypothetical: A huge percentage of giraffe sexual activity is male-male (http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Homosexual_behavior_in_animals#/Mammals) - are giraffes gay?"
AskSocialScience,31cugt,MrOaiki,-1,Sun Apr 5 17:34:55 2015 UTC,"Let's start with the giraffe question: Yes, those giraffes are homosexual in the physical sense. I don't think they're capable of having romantic affection to one another though. Homosexuality in the animal kingdom is described in zoological literature. Nowhere is the ""self proclaimed identity of the giraffe"" mentioned because it's irrelevant.  I'm not sure why you're so angry, spending half of your text rambling about me - according to you - not being able to understand your reasoning. I perfectly understand it, I just don't agree. I'm heterosexual. I like cooking, I hate sports, and ""beer and steak"" is not my favorite thing to consume. If I'm perceived as gay in say a southern US culture, that's fine with me. I don't have to identify myself as ""heterosexual"" if what I eat has to have anything to do with it. I'm just stating that the definition of homosexuality has nothing to do with self identification (I say, the Webster dictionary says, Encyclopedia Brittanica says and Swedish Nationalencyclopedin says) . I agree with those common definitions. Homosexuality is simply about physical and/or romantic attraction in individuals of the same sex. Just like heterosexuality is about the opposite. I don't have to identify myself as anything.  Let's take alcohol for example. I don't drink it. Not because I'm religious nor because of any medical condition I might have. I just don't like the taste nor the effect. In Sweden, where alcohol is a very predominant part of our culture, not drinking alcohol at all is quite uncommon. There's a term for us - ""nykterist"". Literally ""soberist"". Now, I don't identify myself as ""one of those who don't drink hence should be called nykterist"". Yet people believe a lot of other things come with it, that I'm asocial or a former alcoholic or part of an organization. I'm not. I simply do not drink alcohol. Now, if the minimum requirement to define someone as soberist is ""one who does not consume alcohol"" then by all means, I am that.  Being homosexual doesn't mean you have to be part of any gay community nor identify yourself as anything. I say the dictionaries have a correct definition of the term. So when Ahmadinejad said ""there are no homosexuals in Iran"" he was rightfully laughed at. And I would still laugh at him had it turned out that no one in the whole country is part of any ""gay community"" nor has any ""homosexual identity"". Because as I said I the beginning of this post, it is not relevant (I say and the dictionaries implicitly say)."
AskSocialScience,31cugt,Lucas_Steinwalker,1 point,Sun Apr 5 18:10:04 2015 UTC,"You are refuting your own point with the nykterism comparison.  Nyterkism is a social construct, which is the only reason you can both technically apply to its (highly localized, highly subjective) criteria and also not choose to identify with the baggage that comes along with it. If it was not a social construct there would not be that kind of duality to it, it would simply be.  So let's take what you said and put it back into the homosexuality context:   I have sex with men  (I don't drink alcohol) The dictionary definition of homosexual (nykterist) is having sex with men (not drinking alcohol) This makes me technically homosexual (a nykterist) Even though I am technically homosexual (a nykterist) I don't have to choose to identify myself as one Other people may ascribe other traits upon me if they realized that I meet the qualifying criteria that I don't necessarily identify with or believe are true about me.   What good is the dictionary definition if applying it causes connotation that you don't necessarily want to ascribe to something? What's the purpose of recognizing that you technically are a nykterist if you simultaneously don't consider yourself one?  Another analogy: Red hair is a physical reality. Being a ginger is a social construct. Homosexual activity is a physical reality. Being homosexual is a social construct.  Can you imagine a world where no one ever came up with the concept of a ""ginger?"" There would still be people with red hair, just none of the weird negative associations.  Can you imagine a world where no one ever came up with the concept of a ""homosexual""? There would still be people engaging in homosexual activity, again without any of the weird negative associations.  The real fine line is that homosexuality definitely exists but where it becomes a social construct is when you say a creature can BE a homosexual. Giraffes can't be homosexual. Giraffe sexuality just happens to include homosexual behavior. Humans are capable of being homosexual, beyond engaging in homosexual activity because we not long ago created a social construct called homosexuality and decided it is a condition that someone can be bucketed into.  I think you are absolutely correct that the dictionary definition of homosexuality is accurate but outside of ""homosexuality"" there is an entirely different concept of ""being a homosexual"" that has it's own social reality that goes way beyond the dictionary definition."

Something doesn't add up."
AskSocialScience,31cugt,bubbleberry1,3,Mon Apr 6 16:14:04 2015 UTC,"Not sure if the other responses to your question actually provided a good answer, so I'll try a different approach.   In earlier times in European history, when Christianity dominated, people's identity was conceived of (or ""constructed"") around sin and religious faith. Flesh in general was tempting, and giving in to such temptation was sinful. It did matter who you were tempted by, but it didn't have the same meaning as today. For example there was no legal age of consent, and so there was no legal definition of adults or minors. Because they didn't make this distinction it wouldn't be possible for someone to have the identity of a pedophile, since that requires not just the categories of adult and childhood, but also people's self reflexion that they fall into one of those categories as well as societies acknowledgement of those categories and self identification. So while it is true that people engaged in sexual acts that today we would consider highly deviant, at the time they did not conceive of them the same way. However, I'm not saying that these acts were acceptable back then either. They were instead considered very sinful, and the identity of the person engaging in them was a sinner, not a pedophile.   It turns out that this type of distinction is true for what we mean by the term heterosexual or homosexual today. Back then, people didn't conceive of themselves as homosexual because they engaged in or desired sex with someone who had the same sex organs. They were sinners, tempted by the devil, sodomites, etc, but not ""homosexual"" because they just did not have that category of self identification in their culture. Interestingly, they tended to lump together all sorts of sexual acts into the sinner category - so non procreative sexual acts (i.e. in the butt) between people with different sex organs was the same as between people with the same sex organs.  In our more modern culture, we tend to distinguish between sexual attraction, sexual behaviors, and sexual identity. We recognize that these three things don't always cohere in ways that we think should make sense. That is why some men identify as straight, but are attracted to men and women, but only have sex with their wives. It men can identify as straight and only be attracted to women, yet still engage in sexual acts with other men. This last variation happens sometimes when men are stuck in a homosocial environment where there are no female sexual partners (e.g. prison, military, sailors, monastery)   I hope this is explanation helps!"
AskSocialScience,31cugt,MrOaiki,0,Sat Apr 4 13:07:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you for an elaborate answer. I seem to be alone here on this, but I'll still try to get my point across.   Let's start with the semantics. Homosexuality is by the common modern definitions someone who is romantically involved in and/or physically attracted to people of the same sex. In addition to that, one's sexuality can be attributed to an identity but not necessarily. Not all homosexuals are part of a gay community nor express their sexuality in a way other than affection to/interest in people of the same sex. I argue that this is still homosexuality, and if such a person is asked the question of whether he/she is homosexual, the person would answer yes. Unless there's a stigma associated with truthfully answering that question, and the person doesn't want to risk anything. How homosexuals/homosexual acts have been perceived throughout history does of course vary, hey it even varies across countries and cultures today. You, and others that have responded here, argue that in certain historical periods of time and cultures, people did not have any concept of homosexuality. This is where I disagree.  In 6th century China, painters depicted homosexual acts. This alone doesn't mean anything, if you'd ask them they could as well have called it just ""sexual acts"", although I am sure they knew it was not man/woman but man/man. Looking at the paintings, homosexual acts are not set in the same surroundings as heterosexual acts, it's not a ""housewife having sex with her husband, but the housewife happens to have a penis"". Anyway... In Chinese literature of the time, ""the passion of the cut sleeve"" (断袖之癖) is mentioned (source Bret Hinsch - Passion of the sleeve). They speak of homosexual acts well aware of them being ""sex with same sex"" or ""love of the same sex"". The reason we don't see more documented love stories from ancient China is, from what I understand, because the pronoun he/she do not exist. So many romantic poems can/could mean either herero- or homosexual love unless the partners gender were specifically expressed.  Now let's look at Europe and the west in general. A good source of proving that homosexuality as a concept existed, is to look in the bible. Leviticus 18:22 ""Do not had sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable"". I'd argue that this is very clear proof that the concept of homosexuality vs heterosexuality existed for at least as long as the bible.  Tl;dr Homosexuality has been documented throughout history, hence I argue that the concept was very well known."
AskSocialScience,31cugt,jockeysdaughter,2,Sun Apr 5 03:50:21 2015 UTC,"Proving that people have engaged in sexual acts with individuals of the same sex in the past is not the issue. It is defining an identity for others, in the past.  You even do it to the people of today when you say they would answer yes that they identify as homosexual for committing sexual acts or being attracted to the opposite sex.  Your two examples of China and the Bible are about not committing sexual acts. Are the paintings now about being a homosexual, about an identity? Or is this strictly about acting on it?

When you're talking about how individuals actually mentally act and function, you don't handwave their dispositions and act like the entirety of it exists purely in social terms. Sociology doesn't describe primarily in social terms because that's all there is. It does it because its not psychology. The problem is that people like you often get confused and think that the aspect of human experience you focused on is the entirety of the story. But someone trying to ask about the general case obviously wants to know both halves. And you seem to legitimately not understand that social forces don't exist in a vacuum. They play through human psychology and exist to interact with it. 100 aliens dropped in a human world disguised like and told they were humans but with radically different minds wouldn't act identically to 100 humans.   Going back to my first post, trans people generally have a very real physically oppositely sexed brain. This isn't a social construction of any kind, but a physical state.

What our society considers to be ""trans"" might not constitute ""trans"" in a different society, and so even if being what we label as trans has a biologically determinant component, ""trans"" (or gay or straight or bi or whatever) is a socially constructed identity and not a biological state.   The fact that gender and sexuality are social constructs does not preclude them from having a basis in objective reality or biology. As Weismantel writes, just because reproduction is a biological fact with an objective referent doesn't mean that what constitutes a ""reproductive act"" isn't socially determined.

Sure they could be broken down further for accuracy, the spectrum is real not a social construct.""   So again, when we say that sexual identity is a social construct, we aren't saying that there is no biological referent. Being male has a clear biological referent (duh) but what constitutes a masculine identity is a social determination (likewise with sexuality and race).  And again, we're not saying that sexual identity is ""learned"" or ""innate"", we're saying that the very idea of having a sexual identity is a social construct. The fact that we are using labels like ""gay"" or ""straight"" or ""black"" or ""white"" or whatever is to say that we are defining these concepts socially in ways that have no necessary grounding in objective truth.   A lot of what you're saying is just ""this seems absurd"" and ""I disagree"", which is of course your right to say but not really a productive line of discussion. Try to abandon these preconceptions if you can and read into the subject a bit when you have the time. In the meantime, as a thought experiment, try replacing ""gay"" or ""straight"" with ""noble"" and ""peasant"". The fact that these are obviously social determinations doesn't make them any less real as identities for the people who are living with them; they may also have clear biological referents (e.g., being born with certain family traits or from a certian line) just as there might be clear biological markers for homosexuality. But they are nevertheless social determinations about what constitutes these (in the most reductive sense arbitrary) classes, not objective facts.    I don't think all experts on sexuality think it is all socially constructed   So this is kind of the crux of the misunderstanding. It isn't a question of whether an individual's sexuality is the product of the culture or not (though obviously culture and biology play are involved, just like in just about every other aspect of human development). The very idea of ""sexuality"" as a label that we can apply is a social construct (as are gender, race, and class). This is not to say that these identities are invalid or unimportant, merely that they are aspects of society qua cultural unit, and that as social determinations they vary across cultures and time periods rather than being descriptions of objective truths."

So again, when we say that sexual identity is a social construct, we aren't saying that there is no biological referent.    This seems in direct contradiction of the premise.   In short yes, gender and sexuality are socially constructed.   You cannot have it both ways. There is a mix or there isn't.   The fact that we are using labels like ""gay"" or ""straight"" or ""black"" or ""white"" or whatever is to say that we are defining these concepts socially in ways that have no necessary grounding in objective truth.

The expression of it may be formulated by culture but that's interaction between biology and society.

I don't think that happens. That comparison doesn't work.   The very idea of ""sexuality"" as a label that we can apply is a social construct (as are gender, race, and class).   But for me to believe that I would have to accept there is no pattern to human sexuality. I can accept that science is a human construct seeking to explain a real world. I can accept that common terms for sexualities are only approximation of the patterns, some more accurate than others.  Would you accept there is a ""thing"" called human sexuality?  Would you accept that there are patterns to human sexuality?  Would accept that the patterns manifest and are interpreted in different ways by different cultures?

I feel like I am kind of beating a dead horse at this point; either you accept that I am right about this (perhaps after reading up on the idea of ""social construction"" in some academic writing) or you don't. I can't make you do that, and clearly you don't think that I know what I'm talking about. So I doubt we're going to get anywhere.   Social construction has nothing to do with this debate over the degree of ""Nature vs. Nurture"" (which you seem to be talking about here). I am totally with you (as is pretty much every social scientist I know) that complex human traits are the result of the interaction of both genetic and environmental factors. This is not what is at issue here. Social construction means that the very idea that there is a category with identifying labels called ""sexuality"" (or race, or gender) is entirely an invention of society. That what we refer to as sexual identity is the product of our society. You can quite easily imagine a ""state of nature"" without these labels; animals often engage in what we might call homosexual acts, yet they are not ""gay"" animals because they cannot construct these identities. Similarly, you can imagine that species of dogs, which have very different physical traits, might be ""races"" and yet dogs cannot have a racial identity because there is no process of identity construction on a social level.   I really can't spell this out any clearer than that I think. I hope you understand what I am talking about now.   Edit: I wanted to do a better job at explaining myself so I googled ""explain social constructivism to someone"" and this came up: ""Saying gender is a social construct means that you are a man because society tells you you're a man, not because you chose it."" This is a way better job than I have done. Social constructivism means that it is society which labels you ""gay"" or ""straight""; there is no being ""gay"" without someone to tell you you are--it is totally a social state not an objective truth."

EDIT: if you want more academic links I can give them. As for your course of action, have a relationship of solidarity and submission (it's their community, not yours), though obviously it's hard for a single person to influence socio-economics processes you can avoid direct participation in them by simply not supporting gentrification through consumption. Instead visit the community sincerely, involve yourself in it's culture and life, support it. Gentrification stands opposed to existing communities, and wishes to merely 'capture' it's culture for itself (the result is evidently the debasement of that culture). Poor areas aren't zoo's you visit as a spectacle but remain distant to, these are living people with their own lives. I know loads of people involved in anti-gentrification actions to defend poorer areas, they aren't from those areas and have simply moved their, but for a different reason and with a different logic, to be part of that community rather than supplant it with 'something better'.

I think the primary problem with gentrification isn't that some areas are getting more expensive, but the speed with which these changes can happen and the immense disruption they can cause to some communities. That's where I think local governments have a valid role to play, in reducing or at least slowing the amount of disruption that these changes can cause in people's lives. For example, the wave of gentrification in San Francisco at present is quite disruptive, but it would be far more so if that city didn't have strong rent control laws."

Yet I still find Macionis trotting out the idea that agricultural societies have kids in order to work the farm.   So this really depends on household structure, how long these children count as ""children"", etc.  For example, in the area that I study (Central Turkey), households stay intact in theory until the oldest male member dies (location is patrilineal).  The ideal household is three generations: parents, adult sons and their wives, and their young children all count as ""one household"" (if you need a citation, check out Paul Stirling's Turkish Village).  Even non-resident family members pay into the household (for example, people who engage in non-agricultural labor in the city). At the death of the generation I label ""parents"", the households of the generation I label ""sons and their wives"" split into separate households.  There were not fluid enough labor markets for everyone to hire agricultural laborers (at least, not until the 1960's or 1970's), so the whole system would have been literally impossible without (adult) children to continue the system on (at least until tractors arrive, at which point more children can go to the cities, but still pay into the household--by the 1980's, something like 1/3 of all household income in the village he was studying was made up of remittances from urban workers who still payed into their ""household"" that was many miles from where they actually lived).    So it really depends on the scope of what you're talking about--while a child up to the age of eighteen might be a net drain one considers resources consumed vs. resources produced, an (adult) child who still pays into the household would quickly become a net benefit to the household once they reach the peak of their productive years (which coincides often with parents' declining productivity).  In Stirling's study, he finds that the head of the household often works less than his adult sons, for instance.  edit: as for evidence of their declining economic value in modern economies (because of work laws, etc.) per your original question, see Zelizer's Pricing the Priceless Child."

In the Beckerian word of ""taste for discrimination"", we may or may not see prejudice manifest in wage differentials if the market has constant returns to scale or a sufficient portion of non-discriminating employers.  So the wage gap is sufficient but not necessary to indicate employers have a taste for discrimination.  Does this get discussed in context of the gender-wage gap?  Lots of people claim that the wage gap disappears when correcting for productivity factors (education, experience, age, full time status, etc).  Or at least diminishes greatly.    Is it correct today that we CANNOT conclude from this that employer discrimination based on gender is non-existent.  Rather, it could mean that some employers engage in arbitrage such that on the margin the gap is largely eliminated.  However, this wouldn't tell us if overall we have discrimination in the labor market based on gender, but rather workers are pushed towards certain employers based on gender.    Using the Arrow (1971) approach, we still get inefficiency and the wage differential will exist, as does the difference in MPL as a result.

AskSocialScience,310cdm,Noumenology,3,Wed Apr 1 16:04:50 2015 UTC,"That's complicated. McLuhan and media ecology is considered part of the ""Toronto school"" of media/communications theory. McLuhan's clearly influenced by his teacher, Harold Innis, and Postman is also obviously influenced by McLuhan. It's also related to what Meyrowitz  calls ""Medium Theory."" Media ecology still has some traction, but aside from a brief resurgance in the 90s with early enthusiasm about the internet, it's gone out of style.  There's two reasons that this style of thinking has gone out of favor: the first is a strong sense of determinism that comes out of McLuhan's and other's work, which is both widely unpopular and justly criticized. The second really has to do with a lack of contextualization and situatedness to the observations McLuhan made. Understanding Media was written in the late 60s at the end of modernism and structuralism just before it all fell apart. Lots of critical theory and postmodern perspectives have really factored in to new media theory, which means we try to consider the agency of the individual (people's personal freedom in the way they interact with media), the context of the medium (economic or social forces that may be associated with it), and so on.  Media and communications work has several subdisciplines, Craig outlines them like this. Within each are bodies of theory and thinkers like Kenneth Burke for rhetoric, Stuart Hall for semiotics, Jean Baudrillard for critical, and so on. Depending on the perspective of the subdiscipline, there are different theories which are more or less applicable.   (source: Craig, R. T. (1999). Communication Theory as a Field. Communication Theory, 9(2), 119–161. doi:10.1111/j.1468-2885.1999.tb00355.x)  Here is a page with an overview of some of the other more broad branches of theory. Missing is Actor Network Theory and things like cybernetics, hypertextuality, posthumanism, and lots of other stuff.   McLuhan was a popularizer, and he really motivated people to think about the nature and quality of a medium and not just the content, as communication scholars had been doing. In the history of comm research, early social scientific approaches revolved around fear of mass media, propaganda, and public relations. It turned to a content analysis approach with more rigerous and quantitative methodology. McLuhan deserves credit for really bringing the tide back into a sort of theoretical analysis about more than just counting things or doing panel studies. But like other popularizers and public intellectuals (Joseph Campbell, Neil De Grasse Tyson, Malcolm Gladwell), their value for contemporary academics is low - the field leaves them behind as the public embraces their ideas. I think this is true for everyone who spends more time building their brand than doing their research (Stephen Pinker's short sighted attitudes about scientism are possibly good evidence of this)."

In the face of demand shocks, all of those rules work pretty much identically. Since demand shocks are the main source of recessions, there's no reason to think that NGDP targeting will be much better than inflation targeting.  Draw an AD-AS diagram. Put the price level (or inflation) on the vertical and real GDP (or RGDP growth) on the horizontal.   Draw an adverse demand shock. P and Y are now both below target. Next, draw the response of the Fed when it targets inflation. Next, draw the response of the Fed when it targets nominal income. They'll be nearly identical. That basic intuition survives in more complicated models.  Next, supply shocks. In a large class of models, inflation targeting is the optimal policy for responding to supply shocks, and NGDP targeting is inferior to it; see e.g. here.  There is a different issue that does bear more attention: level targeting vs growth rate targeting.  We can think of four different policies:      Level targeting?       Yes No   Nominal Target Prices Price Level path Inflation target    NGDP NGDP level target path NGDP growth    By comparing NGDP level path targeting to inflation targeting, you're making two deviations at once: changing the goal variable, and changing the level vs growth rate decision.  There is good evidence that targeting a level path is useful, especially in really bad downturns. See also here.  The benefits of switching to NGDP targeting are likely to be small, but the benefits of clearly articulating a level path target could potentially be large."

Also you may want to revisit your main literature review and the theorists you quote, if your approach is close to one already taken by a theorist you may wish to explore the ontology and epistemology of that particular theorist to see if it can inform yours."

Overall, I lean toward critical (think Friere, not Marx), interpretive (think of Eisner's ABER research), and postmodern orientations (drawn particularly to french post structural schools and disability studies research in this vein). I like to use postmodern ideas although looking at them through a pragmatic lens (if that makes sense).    For me, auto-ethnography seems to be the best ""fit"" with its reflexivity, focus on praxis, and suitability (i think) to the subject matter that I want to study (see below).  My ontological and epistemological claims are mostly regarding the senses in particular bodies and how those relate to larger social structures and political/discursive power in education environments.  Essentially, I want to claim that art holds a distinct power that is discursive, but transcends discourse as its modality of communication; that art and design hold unique properties that contribute to critical praxis.    Sadly, my program tends to focus on everything that has happened since 1985, but almost nothing before that, so pardon my ignorance of Habermas, Marx, etc…  I am well schooled on Jameson, Baudrillard, Foucault, etc."

A recent Milken Institute study found that for each additional year of college attained by the residents of a region, the per capita gross domestic product of the region increases a remarkable 17.4 percent.

Those who do not complete the degree have an unemployment rate of 15-16% (in 2009).  Which is about average for those with a undergrad degree in 2009, when this report was done.  They have higher default rate (4x) but I also don't see how much debt they have.  In 2009 both the degree completion and non-completion rates had trouble paying back overall than previous cohorts.  However that rate was about 60% in repayment, 29% not in repayment but still owe and 12% had completely paid off their debt.  But the 2 studies are using different data sources to pull their data.  So I think again the real question is how much debt they have, if they only went to school for one year and they had average amount of debt (24,700 in 2009) then they would have some 6,175 in debt.    While the numbers presented in the studies seem a little dismal they are also from 2009, when the most recent economic downturn was starting.

Homeownership (at least as measured by mortgage borrowing) was also higher for people with student debt than those without in 2009. Since 2009, homeownership for those with student debt has declined much faster and is now lower than homeownership for those without it.  From the New York Fed:   Additional research, to be released in the near future, strongly suggests that this change is causal: the growth in student debt, with its monthly cost and high delinquency and default rate, seems to be reducing both household formation and homeownership."

For international comparison it is difficult to identify unbiased indicators. The best attempts rely on life insurance premiums in different countries, also how premiums are adjusted according to life stage or age (working age, child, retired, etc.). You would of course have to get rid of a lot of cruft, perhaps change premium values to PPP, or disposable income to truly be able to get the economic value people place on life. This would be a representative work.  This however is about the value people place on their own lives or you might even say the replacement value of their lives. How much money should my family have in case they do not have me?  But, I think as your question relates to crime, we enter very difficult territory. I think you have a tentative hypothesis that life is cheap where there is plenty of it, a kind of rudimentary supply and demand hypothesis. Homicides would be a good measure for this, yet typically people are murdered by those known to them, and emotions play a key role. So they are a difficult stand-in for the value of life.  So I suppose stranger homicide would be a relatively decent measure, how much value do we place on the lives of those we don't know? Even this is difficult, as societies are not homogenous and murders are not equal, killing complete strangers by soldiers and serial killers have radically different connotations. Additionally, much of such homicides are related to organized criminal activity, which is a leading cause in the Americas. The most authoritative source on homicide, causes, distribution, etc is the UNODC Global Study of Homicide  Therefore I think I would rephrase your question to make it into one about social cohesion, how close do we feel to unrelated strangers within our societies?"

To a large extent the research is not very strong in this area and it needs more attention.  See the discussion section in the article linked at the bottom for a discussion of the magnitude of the issue as well as the paucity of research.  Since that article was published the Rand institute released a report titled ""Why Is Veteran Unemployment So High?"" which comes closest to answering the question although it is certainly not the final word on the issue.  It is available for download if you search it on google scholar.    There are 5 major hypothesis about the issue.  1. Mental and physical disability hurting employment 2. Unmeasured characteristics are at play due to the voluntary nature of the military 3. Employer discrimination, 4. Skills mismatch and 5. That recent veterans are more likely to have left a job recently.   The mental/physical disability argument is tenuous, because the data sources used to calculate unemployment contain disability variables.  Adjusting for disability does not eliminate the issue.  This is not to say that these issues do not have any effect but that this effect is not sufficient.  However, this is something that more research would be beneficial, especially since veteran disabilities may have some characteristics that are unique to service. Selection is hard to prove or disprove.  However, adjusting for most of the obvious factors eg. race, education etc. does not account for the effect.  Additionally, the gap lowers the farther out from military service one is making this hypothesis tenuous.  Again more study would really be needed here. Employer discrimination is actually one of the easiest ones to test.  Your normal way to do this is the fake resume pairing experiment you often see.  This is easy to do for veterans because their veteran status will be obvious on a job application.  One study has done this and only found that black veterans got a lower callback rate than non-veteran blacks all other groups had no discernible effects.  However, this is only 1 study and was limited to resumes of those who were honorably discharged.  More research is needed but I think this hypothesis is probably the weakest of the bunch. Skills mismatch, is the idea that military skills do not translate as well to civilian skills.  The Rand report does not think this is the main cause.  However, I think their argument is the weakest on this front.  There isn't a lot of data on this issue especially for the post 9-11 veterans.  The main evidence in the report is that the rates of unemployment go down as separation time increases, however, the amount of training and education that can be obtained after leaving the armed forces can really obscure this issue.  The GI bill in particular makes it easier for veterans to obtain job skills after leaving through college education.  These programs of course take time, which could explain why the gap decreases after more time away from discharge.  This data only looks at unemployment which is problematic because it does not look at what kind of job is obtained. This of course needs a lot more study. and finally is the job search hypothesis.  The Rand report thinks this is the most likely answer, I think it likely plays a role but other factors such as skills mismatch and selection likely contribute as well.  The idea is that when looking at veteran unemployment you are choosing a starting point for veterans that is different from the general population.  That is you are looking at people who have just left a job, and job searches take time. The fact that the employment gap shrinks dramatically as cohorts age and with time from discharge makes this hypothesis attractive. In civilian jobs one can job search while still at their current job it is difficult to set up a civilian job while still in the military which could exacerbate the data collection issues.   http://cstsforum.org/assets/media/documents/general_readings/military_transitions/Kleykamp%20(2013)%20unemployment%20earnings%20post-9-11%20vets.pdf"

The Muslim Brotherhood has been around for a long time, and is one of the most powerful Islamist groups, especially in Egypt. It's not only anti-western sentiment, but the west has repeatedly supported Islamists against the left in the Middle east.   why haven't other groups that would oppose the western influence in the middle east and north Africa such as communists or perhaps secular ultra nationalists gained the amount of support today that the Islamists have?   Several main problems that the leftists face in the Middle East;  1)They have repeatedly been sabotaged by the west. Mosaddegh in Iran and Nasser in Egypt are the best examples. The west (even Israel) has repeatedly supported Sunni Islamists to posture against the leftists in the region. Sunni Islamism is primarily concerned with an ""internal cleansing"" to rid the Arab world of secular ""kafiris"" and other infidels that stray from an orthodox interpretation of Islam.  2)They have a bad legacy of totalitarianism from leaders like Saddam and Bashar.  3)Leftist ideologies are almost exclusively secular, which is a huge problem with the current status quo in Islam. Even the more democratic governments in the region have a heavy Muslim influence in the government. There is an ongoing struggle over Islamic identity in much of the Muslim world, and heated disagreement over if traditional Islam is compatible with a democracy, and if democracy is desirable.

His main works  are Social Justice in Islam and Milestones Along the Way.  Social Justice was written earlier and before he fully developed his radicalism, and Milestones is full blown Islamism.  A good secondary source on Qutb is Adnan Musallam's From Secularism to Jihad: Sayyid Qutb and the Foundations of Modern Islamism.  A general book on the causes, frustrations, etc. that have led to the rise of Islamic extremism, see Michael Mazarr's Unmodern Men in the Modern World: Radical Islam, Terrorism, and the War on Modernity.

The loan will be due on the date of your next payday, unless that's less than, say, three days, in which case it'll be the payday after that.   If you need longer to repay the loan, you can apply for an extension. This needs to be done before the due date, and you can either extend the full loan or make a partial repayment and extend the balance. The new due date will be your next payday. You get a limited number of extensions (it varies, but if you've successfully paid off a loan from the same company in the past, they'll be likely to grant you more extensions), but you'll definitely be cut off long before a few months.   One interesting effect of this structure is that payday loan applicants don't tend to think about the loans in terms of interest rates, but rather in terms of fees. Say an applicant borrows $200 for ten days. He provides his checking account information, and the company tells him that on his next payday, they'll electronically withdraw $230 from his account. The interest rate is irrelevant; he sees it as a $30 fee to borrow the money. If he needs to extend the loan to the next payday, that'll be another $30."

AskSocialScience,30q2v4,level10peon,9,Sun Mar 29 18:56:11 2015 UTC,"You're not the first person to think this. Some social sciences have been described as either pre-paradigmatic sciences or multi-paradigmatic sciences (Ritzer). There are a number of reasons why this is not necessarily bad, just different from other sciences. First, the social world is much more complex than the subject matter of many other sciences, which is bound by physical and chemical laws.  Even ecological complexity is vastly more simple than human societies for a second reason, which is human's ability to be self-reflexive and act with intentionality. By self-reflexivity, I mean that people can become aware of themselves and what is motivating/influencing their behavior, and by intentionality, I mean that people can act with intent, agency, free will, or whatever you want to call it. Ironically, the more science we have about humans and society, the greater we are able to act based on that knowledge, creating a powerful feedback mechanism that can change the very objects being studied.   Now let me mention something about social sciences being multi-paradigmatic. In many physical sciences, paradigms are incompatible, where one will eventually become accepted because it is better able to address anomalies and other inconsistencies that arise from an older paradigm. In the social sciences, it might be more correct to say that paradigms can be incommensurable - from within any paradigm, it is difficult to even address the worldview, questions, or research techniques from another paradigm. For example, Blumer's development of symbolic interactionism as a paradigm and a method doesn't really have much to say about macro-level structural inequalities in the global economy that would be studied and understood through a World-systems perspective. This is equally true for paradigms that have fallen out of fashion (for good reason) like structural functionalism.   Finally, the question of disagreement: Because we are trying to study a human-constructed world, there is little that we can point to that is universally true, although there is still a great bit of research effort to try to find such universals. For example, look at Brown's Human Universals in anthropology; but this is all at a very generic level, and cultural differences are equally compelling to study as cultural sameness. I would also add that disagreement is usually about identifying and explaining under what circumstances one theory is more useful compared to another theory. For example, how and under what circumstances does social capital lead to better life outcomes, and what type of life outcomes are we talking about? Add on top of this the notion that many theories are partial and incomplete, and also deal with probabilistic rather than deterministic causality, e.g., education broadly speaking is associated with higher income, but not for everyone and not under every circumstance across every cultural context.  Given all these complexities, it is understandable why someone could conclude that social sciences and all its disagreements is no better than philosophy or speculation (i.e., common sense or intuition). But I disagree. Philosophy, while important in its own right, lacks the testing of ideas against the empirical world (except in the more broad view of ""science"" as a branch of philosophy). Similarly, if we just base our knowledge of the social world on what we think is true, or what our ideological presuppositions suggest should be true, that does not sound like the basis for a reliable system of knowledge either.   The problem is that it is understandable to want a science to yield the answer, when that is probably an unrealistic goal for social sciences. I think there is some value in accepting the notion that there is no one perfect theory of everything, that we should be aware that all theories are partial, and that multiple (sometimes even competing) theories can all offer insight into how the world actually works.  I would love to hear what other folks have to say about your questions, but that's just my 2 cents."

In a field like  economics, there are politicized opinions with an an agenda, but there are also completely academic opinions that are generally agreed upon by academics. I'll link to this comment which does a good job of discussing that.  With something like anthropology, there are actually some fundamental, widely agreed upon principles like cultural relativism. There could be disagreement over the meaning of some specific discovery of archaeology, but to compare that to the natural sciences, it's like people debating the conclusions of an experiment. There's nothing wrong with that, it's part of the scientific process. They're not disagreeing over anything fundamental like the scientific method.  There is disagreement within social science fields, but they're not fundamental disagreements. Most economists will say that QE worked, most political scientists will agree that the world system is in some form on anarchy, most anthropologist will agree with cultural relativism and that anthropology should be holistic, most sociologists will agree that class and gender differences exist and affect society.

Another possibility is that although Indonesia subsudizes fuel, it does not subsudize grain production.  Although the United States does not subsudize petroleum fuels, it does, via a variety of direct and indirect means, effectively subsudize the production certain food crops, especially corn (meaning maize) and soybeans.  The result is that prices for many food crops in the United States tend to be stabilized by various government programs.

The main problem with doing so is that it requires some forecasting that becomes exponentially inaccurate over time, EG the response to changes in marginal rates depends on the point of the cycle you are in, what trade looks like, how strong growth is, what public spending is doing etc.  Simulations like this are useful for understanding how different tax systems perform in the same normalized market and indeed we can simulate changes in rates but these provide an idea for direction rather then a useful method for understanding absolutely what a specific rate will behave like.  If you are asking if increasing tax rates will also increase revenue then yes, none of the rates are even close to the point where a Laffer effect would exist. Largely increasing tax rates are undesirable for certain forms of taxes for reasons other then revenue collection, for example corporation taxes are so distortionary and have such a high compliance cost that the real cost of raising an additional $n in revenue is somewhere around $n*2; while its not an efficient way of raising revenue if you are unconcerned with growth the high costs of the tax are an irrelevance."

Depending on how you mean ""fundamentalist,"" it gets even more obscure. Robert Bellah describes belief as having more to do with practices than what we profess - given that most people don't bother going to services on a regular basis, it seems to suggest people are less involved then they profess to be. But, maybe fundamentalism has to do with the character of belief - like, you're fundamentalist if you don't go to the movies or can't wear long sleeves (some pentecostals believe these are heaven or hell issues). These groups are still in the minority. The largest groups are evangelicals, then catholics, then mainstream protestants.

A short list of some significant issues I have had with him in the past;   He asserts that the great depression was caused by falling labor share (higher profits & lower wages) which is simply wrong, consensus almost entirely supports that which Friedman posited in Monetary History of the US; a speculative bubble cause a financial recession and tightening of monetary policy after the crash caused the depression. Also labor share actually rose significantly through the 20's. He also asserts that recessions in general are caused by falling labor share, he shows a cyclic correlative effect for profits as proof of this (ignoring that its expected that profits would by cyclic) entirely ignoring that the last three (possibly five) recessions occurred during a period where labor share has been virtually unchanged. For the record the only cause of recessions is shocks, there is no magic reason why they occur or mechanism that would allow us to prevent them; we smooth the cycle with monetary policy but that's the extent of our control. He uses that absurd graph showing absolute corporate profits vs hourly wages which EPI originated constantly, ignoring that its entirely excluding salaried workers, it comparing real & nominal figures and that it uses self-reported income instead of payroll (under reporting bias). There has been no divergence between productivity and income. Bizarrely he seems to have a high-school level of understanding of labor economics, he doesn't understand the mechanism by which wages are set nor the mechanisms by which they rise. Similarly he also makes some pretty absurd remarks regarding the economic effects of increasing labor share (such as forcing businesses to raise wages during a recession). Similar problems with how he regards unionization as a silver bullet for an assorted list of ailments. He doesn't understand the significance of credit markets in cycle management, he outright claims that the ability of businesses to access credit during recessionary periods has no effect on the severity of recessions. Many economists, myself included, would assert that monetary policy is our most important tool for managing recessions, a smaller number (also including me) would assert that its the only effective tool in advanced economies. There is a huge open question regarding the efficacy of fiscal stimulus in advanced economies, its also notable that the number of economists who believe congress could design a reasonable stimulus plan is nearly half of those who believe fiscal stimulus is useful. Many of his ideas are sound when simply stated in short form but go loopy in the details. Increasing EITC would be a very good thing indeed, removing the taper not so much.

AskSocialScience,30lesv,pensivegargoyle,2,Sat Mar 28 12:40:59 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between the continental European and Anglo-American usage of the term liberal and that comes out of the fact that Anglo-American liberalism developed a different flavour or school of liberalism that is still focused on individual freedom but sees this freedom arising from opportunities for personal development rather than only through a hands-off state. For them, individual freedom requires a social context that goes beyond property rights and the enforcement of contract to include public education, aid to the poor and taxation of the aristocracy and leading capitalists. In Britain this kind of social liberalism was present in the work of John Stuart Mill, was developed more by Thomas Hill Green and Leonard Hobhouse and continued influentially into the 20th Century with William Beveridge and John Maynard Keynes. By the end of the first decade of the 20th Century the British Liberal Party was a social liberal party. In the US, the progressive moment and thinkers like Lester Frank Ward picked up social liberalism along with Herbert Croly. Politically, these ideas were advocated by individuals in both parties though obviously the collection of politicians, academics and trade unionists around Franklin Delano Roosevelt created the form of social liberal politics that still has some influence in the Democratic Party today.  Where the confusion with social democracy comes in is that there has been considerable discussion and picking up of ideas across that fuzzy boundary with social liberalism. By the 1920s, social democrats had a problem. They had decided that it would be undesirable or impossible to have a government that simply ordered a quick end to capitalism along revolutionary socialist lines and would instead pursue immediate reforms to capitalism to benefit the working class. On that basis social democrats in Germany and the UK were elected to office.  Reform, unfortunately, came up against the accepted wisdom on economic management (or circumstances that forced the same) from government experts, academics and the financial community that such measures had to be sacrificed for the benefit of a balanced budget and a strong currency. Facing Depression with these policies was untenable, the result in Britain being the splitting of the Labour Party and in Germany the rather worse consequence of Hitler.   Roosevelt in the US and the Social Democrats in Sweden proved around the same time that the social liberal economic toolkit for demand management created economic conditions that made reform sustainable. This is why these ideas were picked up generally after World War 2, willingly by social democrats and somewhat less willingly by conservatives who didn't politically have much choice. Classical liberalism and its political representatives would be a relative fringe movement until it regathered strength in the 1970s. Both social liberals and social democrats resisted neoliberalism up until the 1990s so the confusion is natural."

AskSocialScience,30lesv,Amerikanskan,1 point,Sun Mar 29 12:02:27 2015 UTC,"In regards to why Americans refer to social democratic parties as socialists, it has a lot to do with Americans just not knowing what socialism is.  A lot of the Cold War propaganda portrayed communism/socialism as being defined by an over-arching, authoritarian government. So this idea of communism/socialism being defined by the amount of government involvement eventually turned into there being a divide between the communism of the USSR/People's Republic of China and the ""socialism"" of the Nordic countries (even though this is actually social democracy) in the minds of the American people. The reason for this being that since the government has a lot of involvement in the economy and social safety nets they must be socialist because no ""true"" capitalist government would be that involved.  This sort of thinking is still pretty influential, in the United States, today. Many high school and college textbooks (particularly McGraw-Hill's ""Understanding Business"" textbook) will reinforce this ""communism vs. socialism"" divide, where they'll define socialism as being something along the lines of ""an economic system based on the idea that some basic businesses should be owned by the government so that profits can be more evenly distributed among the people"" while defining communism as being something along the lines of ""an economic system where the government makes most of the economic decisions and owns most of the means of production"".  Another aspect of this is that because of the McCarthy trials, the terms ""communist"" and""socialist"" became bad words, leading to those words being used as insults (usually by American conservatives) against anybody that wants to have more government involvement. So since social democrat parties advocate for more government involvement than your average neoliberal, American conservative deems necessary, they're stereotyped as being ""socialists"", and unfortunately, the classification has stuck."

AskSocialScience,30hoo6,samlir,3,Fri Mar 27 13:52:03 2015 UTC,"Accepted enough to where there are many who have focused on how this happens.Two theories that relate to this question are Cognitive Dissonance Theory and Self-Perception Theory.  In Self-Perception Theory, Daryl Bem proposed that when one's own internal states are not as obvious, one comes to know one's attitudes towards that object after observing their behaviour. Thus, as in your first example, according to Self-Perception Theory, the individual would come to develop internal reasonings for why that behavior was important.   Cognitive Dissonance Theory, proposed by Leon Festinger, states that when one's actions and cognitions seem incongruent, one will experience cognitive dissonance, or psychological discomfort until he incongruence can be resolved. This can be done by changing actions and cognitions, changing the conflicting cognition, adding in new cognitions, or simply putting out of mind the information that has lead to this contradiction. Thus, if you be nice to your cousin simply to your cousin, eventually, you will probably like them more. While Cognitive Dissonance has been the more popular explanation, these two could be seen as complementary (Fazio et al., 1977).  Somewhat related, my own work focuses on looking at interventions that use Gordon Allport's Intergroup Contact Theory (Allport, 1954; Pettigrew, 1998) to bring groups together. This basically says that if you bring together two people from two groups who have not gotten along traditionally under certain optimal conditions, they will soon begin to reappraise their own group and the other group while beginning to actually like the person across from them. It adds a bit more than dissonance theory, but is similar in some respects.   References:  Allport GW. 1954. The Nature of Prejudice. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley. 537 pp.  Bem, D. J. (1972).

Second, the reason representativeness is important is because in other contexts it's completely inaccurate. Reddit is one community online: other communities foster religiosity in various ways. Other communities do not have the same rhetoric or discursive patterns about these ideas and may be totally unconcerned with religiousness. And even more important, not everyone is online - religion is actually growing in other parts of the world where people are less likely to be participating in those discussions on reddit.  In media studies there is a bias towards use and technology adoption, versus non-use. This is what Louise Woodstock calls a ""pro-innovation bias"". Studies on non-users are likely to take the deviance angle - that use is the new norm. Similarly, studies on religiousness seem to focus on the irreligious, the deviant population. This report from Pew is one example.  I would end with a footnote from that study that reframes this whole idea in a useful way:    “Societies where people’s daily lives are shaped by the threat of poverty, disease and premature death remain as religious today as centuries earlier. These same societies are also experiencing rapid population growth. In rich nations, by contrast, the evidence demonstrates that secularization has been proceeding since at least the mid-twentieth century (and probably earlier) – but at the same time fertility rates have fallen sharply, so that in recent years population growth has stagnated and their total population is starting to shrink. The result of these combined trends is that rich societies are becoming more secular but the world as a whole is becoming more religious.   edit: the ""Science Works, Bitches!"" meme is more like scientism rhetoric (a new form of radical empiricism) , which is definitely associated with new atheists like Dawkins and Harris. That's probably the reason you see it as part of some ""enlightened neckbeard trinity,"" of Atheism, the STEMjerk, and Scientism. There are researchers working on reddit now but the collusion of those three ideas hasn't been discussed widely yet (that I know of)."

From a dialectical Marxist point of view, I think the answer might differ a bit. Enough contradictions mount between the exploited class and the exploiting class to realize the unsustainability of the system when rebellions and revolutions occur.

These were common throughout history, and a threshold seems to be reached where the subjugated class revolts and forcefully modifies society to make slavery impermissible.   Around the passage that made me think of this, Graeber notes that (effective) class revolts (he doesn't use the word class, but he is talking about debtors and creditors) may have been more common than slave or caste revolts because in the former, the social relations around it had a pretense of equality, while a slave or a member of a low caste is considered ""intrinsically inferior""; also in the former case, there's no clear line of demarcation between upper and lower class.    So unless he is interpreting his reading wrong or I am interpreting my reading wrong, it seems that slave revolts which resulted in a change of institutions and culture were not common, or not nearly as common as class revolts.  I guess a historian would be welcome here, because from what I know (which is admittedly very little), slavery has existed more or less continuously for as long as there are records.

Though capitalism needed slavery up to a certain point, it also became a lag upon it (for a variety of reasons).

Slavery based production is enforced through violence, therefore the market is fragmentary (i.e. a spatial and conceptual differentiation between production and exchange). The capitalist social relation is based on the free selling of labour-time by a population. A violent legal relation is a fetter upon that capitalistic social relation insofar as it limits the market (i.e. by the absence of a labour market) thereby reducing competition and economic efficiency (by making the standard of success based primarily on violence). Also a legal relation of unfreedom restricts the capacity for commodity consumption and thereby furthermore restricts market penetration and possibility. Legal enforcement restricts the ability of capital to shape the proletariat to it's own wishes, it reflects a stage of history where violence ruled supreme insofar as the money-form was not yet concentrated or utilised in a sufficiently productive manner. Though slavery is highly productive, when it becomes fragmented by the rise of nominally free wage earners, it's drawbacks emerge. In the low capital intensive industries such as agriculture in that period slavery was a logical decision, however in a period of industrialisation and all that goes with it, the higher degrees of capital injection - partially the result of slavery - made the costs of slavery in terms of risk also to high. Capital wishes to free labour form it's historic bonds and tethers only to bring it further under it's control. (As such, for many internationally orientated industries, the free movement of labour is a net-benefit to them but comes at the expense of 'old' national sentiments etc.)"

Large distinctions exist between the slavery of say Africans by Ancient Egypt, or the slaves of Chinese Emperors, to that of the European slave trade which was not merely more brutal but systematically industrialised to beyond any previous level and became organised around a specifically market and capitalist ideology. European slavery was the first time in history masses of people had produced commodities for sale, an existence that was at first forced, but today is the norm of economic relations.

AskSocialScience,3092rp,Robertlnu,3,Sun Mar 29 00:48:11 2015 UTC,"There's different factors to consider for the West and the Arab World. In the West, after the British were defeated in the American Revolution, there was a wave of immigration of slaves travelling with masters who had been displaced by the war. The increased presence of American slaves in Britain led to a greater conversation about slavery and a greater perception that slavery was an unjust institution. The Quakers also had a huge impact on abolitionist movements, especially in the US, citing religious beliefs as a reason against slavery.  What I think is the greater factor, though, is the slaves themselves. There were many slaves who were imported from Africa who were highly educated, be it in Qur'anic schools in Africa, or through having been abducted as prisoners of war, some even being better educated than their masters. These were people who could read and write and - more importantly - publish works about their experiences and about the inhumanity of slavery. Olaudah Equiano's work, especially, did a lot to galvanise the early abolition movement by providing it with information from a slave that humanised them and demonstrated what slavery was for the people involved in it. These sentiments reached more and more people, and eventually became what we see as the norm. Essentially, the voices of slaves helped people realise that slavery is not very nice.  In the Arab world, you have a combination of pressure from Western powers, but also gradual reinterpretation of the Qur'an and its passages about slavery. Much like the West would reinterpret the Bible to leave out slavery, the same began to happen in the Arab world, once again, partly due to slaves' educations, but also due to an increasing number of slave revolts and the increasing power of slaves in society. Quite simply, as slaves became more and more human, it made less and less sense philosophically, intellectually, and theologically to dehumanise them. Verses that advocated for the manumission of slaves became more prominent in Qur'anic interpretation, and slavery became seen as something that, while not expressly forbidden by Allah, was not something that good people did. Good people freed slaves, not create more of them.   I hope that helps a little, and if you have any questions, please feel free to ask!"

The first reason Douglas addresses is one of those distinctions: Race theory (and social darwinism, I think) were both developed to defend the African slave trade, maybe because of the way they were acquired, maybe because of the sheer scale of it.  Something related to how it was justified is why it was justified.  If slavery has always been accepted, why was it now being attacked, and why did anyone feel the need to come to its defense?  This question just moves back to the root of what changed, if anything (maybe I have my history wrong), changed around the 18th-19th century?  Then again, there were other major changes in that same period, namely the shift of people into wage labor and the rise of states/capitalism/bureaucracy.  I don't know if this is disputed or not, but I have read that blacks in the US, once freed, were basically just re-enslaved through the prison system.  Perhaps mechanization and wage labor filled the gap that slavery once did."

AskSocialScience,308vkc,iamelben,9,Wed Mar 25 12:43:17 2015 UTC,"The analysis of choice for many economists is Card and Krueger's Myth and Measurement, which explored the effects of moderate-to-small increases in the minimum wage on aggregate employment (spoiler alert: there's not a lot).  So let's go back in time a little bit to 1938 and the Fair Labor Standards Act, where the minimum wage was originally instituted.  It was a whopping $.25 an hour, and here's the key: it affected 43% of all nonsupervisory wage and salary workers.  Now, let's be clear about something.  Employment fell.  In some sectors (the data I've read from Selzter [1997] is mainly from lumber and textile mills in the south, where I'm from) it fell by as much as 17% (but only in mills that had been paying lower than the minimum wage).  Another effect was that, in textile mills at least, adoption of technology that replaced workers increased at a faster rate.  Hand-operated machines decreased by 23%, converted transfer machines increased by 69%, and fully automatic processes increased by 10%.  Also, overall imports of seamless hosiery (the good produced by the mills in question) increased by 27%.  Whew.  Now all of that sounds like a reason to NOT raise the minimum wage, but couched in ALL that data is a good reason to raise the minimum wage by a moderate amount.  The reason is this: there really isn't that much effect so long as the following conditions are met:  1.)  The nominal increase in minimum wage is moderate compared to average wages.  2.)  The number of people affected by the increase is also moderate.  So, those two conditions in mind, a great reason to raise the minimum wage is that it won't really have any deleterious effects, and will improve the lives (vis a vis higher wages) of those it aims to help.

This analysis seems to compare the employment numbers at some time t1 (before minimum wage increase) with some later time t2 (after minimum wage increase). But wouldn't the relevant comparison be between the employment numbers at t2 with the employment numbers that would have occurred at t2 in the alternative history where there was no minimum wage increase? Of course this latter figure is unavailable, by definition, but wouldn't recognizing this as the correct study question the relevance of the study that was done?"

In effect they had a treatment and control group, which allowed them to control for homogeneous macroecomomic trends (which you seem to be alluding to).   DID isn't without criticism however.

I don't want to put you off econometric studies, but they are definitely less rigorous compared to the hard sciences (Makes it fun though, when you read a novel or famous study that uses a clever identification technique!)  As I said, the main criticism of DID is the parallel trends assumption. It is a big assumption. People will try and justify it if they use the technique, so I would check out the paper itself.

AskSocialScience,306hly,cdts,5,Tue Mar 24 21:38:35 2015 UTC,"For clarity, we'll accept Althusser's demarcation between the Young Marx and the Mature Marx. That split occurs with the writing of 'The German Ideology' (1845-1846 roughly)  The 'Young Marx' is primarily understood as a young Hegelian. He's interested in 'freedom' as a driving force of history in which people strive to harmonize the contradictions between the individual and the social, the civil and the political. This is a somewhat unhelpful characterization because even as a young Hegelian Marx was somewhat odd and not all young Hegelians saw this as their project.  One simplistic way to look at it is to interpret his Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 is as asking the question: ""What is the precondition for the entire Hegelian system?"" In answering that question, he reinterprets Hegel's (among others) theory of Alienation as a material process which structures how the individual confronts both society and other individuals. That is to say, the answer to the question: 'why do we feel disconnected from our work?' is that we're disconnected from our work because we don't own the things we create, we create things for others and are compensated with a wage. Even stranger is that the objects we create confront us on the market place as, in Jonathan Wolff's words, 'alien forces' which discipline our activity. And even stranger than that is that these alien forces aren't alien at all. They're the product of human beings laboring and purchasing in various ways which reproduce the kind of society which works like that.   The Old Marx shifts in focus from philosophical analysis to political economic analysis. Alienation as a purely philosophical idea becomes the fundamental reason why markets exist, commodity fetishism exists, and why a labour theory of value is possible in a positive sense. He has, by this point, carved out his philosophical niche distinct from the young Hegelians. History is no longer the battle of ideas but the battle of who controls what. Why? Because the Hegelian battle of ideas in society depends on who has the power to proliferate this or that idea to the masses.   By this time we get more hard-economic analysis which develop particular kinds of theories around them. Philosophy-wise we see him focus on political organization as a realization of this or that idea and the scientific expression of this or that idea.   Edit: I should mention that this is meant to give you a window into this topic rather than a definitive take on it. Some of my characterizations are down-right weird and they're weird because I think this kind of presentation makes them easier to digest"
AskSocialScience,301zpy,setar1,40,Mon Mar 23 20:55:06 2015 UTC,"A good book to read that looks at Venezuela is The Paradox of Plenty. Basically an examination of Venezuela and a few other countries to try and explain why it is that oil rich countries who get massive sums of cash so often fail to develop into sustainable states independent of their oil industry. In other words, why is this wealth not leading to development?  Karl's argument, as best as I can summarize it is: When a state gains this type of wealth that has no history of statecraft (that is, a state that lacks the institutional strength to maintain a tax network), policymakers seek to incentivize their economies to expand and diversify, so that way it isn't dependent upon petroleum in the long term. In addition to this, policymakers want to stay in power so they distribute benefits to people within the state, either because the autocrat wants to buy off their silence, or the representative wants to buy off votes. Publics works programs, economic incentives, low to no taxes, etc. becomes understood as the standard operating procedures for the state. In other words, everyone expects for everyone to gain, and no one to lose. But they overextend and the economy collapses. The government can't just get rid of those public programs, that distribution of benefits from oil money, and at the same time it cannot tax to make up this money due to weak state structure and institutions. The state becomes reliant upon oil rents to pay off constituents and paying to recover from the collapse of rapid expansion. Actors within the state will then see opportunity to get involved in politics to gain a share of the petroleum rents, through interest group or political party formation, depending on regime type at this point. The state effectively becomes a large distribution scheme, where all actors are trying to maintain a positive sum game. No one rocks the boat so everyone can get a split of the oil rents. They become a petrol-state rather than a nation-state.  Pretty neat book. Worth a read if you'd like to keep going into this subject."

Keep in mind, my article only mentions corruption among Chavistas but don't let this lead you into believing corruption wasn't already horrible before he came into power.  Unsustainable economic policies (ie price controls, currency controls, inefficient running of PDVSA) and misuse of oil revenues.  Extreme difficulty in starting and running your own business, and very difficult to invest in as a for foreign companies. One of the most difficult places in the world (8th from the bottom) to start your own business. Plus, what foreign investor would invest in Venezuela with the risk of expropriation by the government?    Venezuela was already in a bad place before Chavez came to power with tons of inflation, rampant corruption, and all of the countries oil profits going to foreigners. Now after 16 years of Chavez-branded socialism, the country is in a much worse place. Yes, he helped reduce poverty, give them more access to healthcare, education, and low-priced goods, but through unsustainable economic policies at the expense of the country. Interestingly enough, despite reductions in poverty, crime and homicide increased significantly from 1999 to now. I find it a bit funny how apparently after 16 years of throwing hundreds of billions of oil-funded dollars into social programs, crime worsened? Hard to say the poor were better off if they were turning to crime more then ever before (and trust me, crime rates weren't in a good place in 1999 to begin with).   16 years later with oil revenues decreasing, and one of the highest inflation rates in the world (exacerbated by the very price controls that were put in by Chavez), things are looking quite bleak for the country. Sure, the country wasn't in a great place to begin with after decades of capitalism, but Chavez's socialist Bolivarian Revolution has only worsened things.    Among Latin American countries, the economies of Brazil, Chile, Peru and Argentina all have expanded more rapidly than Venezuela's since Chavez took office in 1999, recording average growth between 3 and 5 percent a year. Venezuela, by contrast, averaged a 2.8 percent annual increase of gross domestic product between 1999 and 2011, according to International Monetary Fund figures. By that measure, the country was outperformed by every other member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries except Libya. Even war-torn Iraq posted higher growth.   And keep in mind Venezuela has the largest oil reserves on the planet. Despite this, and despite the enormous increase in oil prices since 1999 to ~2013, the country still has worse economic metrics than its comparable neighbors.

The country has also achieved rapid improvement on the U.N. Human Development Index, which measures a range of indicators from living standards to life expectancy   However, while inflation was bad in 1999, it wasn't the worst in the world like it is now in 2015. While there were some shortages of items during the 90s, the status quo for grocery shopping wasn't waiting in line starting at 5am and waiting until 9am until you get your milk and eggs like it is now. While crime was bad in the 90s, we didn't have the 2nd worst homicide rate in the world like we do now.

Most PE textbooks will offer alternative views on how economics is studied that you'd be unlikely to encounter in any significant manner before upper level courses. Even if you don't agree with some of the views presented in this kind of text, it's good to have additional information and realize that economics has a wide variety of viewpoints from which studies are undertaken."

AskSocialScience,2zznli,my_coding_account,10,Mon Mar 23 07:22:38 2015 UTC,"This is a really great question, but one that's difficult to answer, conclusively.  We do know, that in many 'emotional tests' (e.g. empathy, aversion to harm, etc.) women score higher than men, see:   Eisenberg N, Lennon R: Sex differences in empathy and related capacities. Psychol Bull 1983; 94:100–131 Eagly AH, Steffen VJ: Gender stereotypes stem from the distribution of men and women into social roles. J Pers Soc Psychol 1984; 46:735–754 Reverby S: A caring dilemma: womanhood and nursing in historical perspective. Nurs Res 1987; 36:1–5   However, although women do score higher on empathy, they aren't more likely to forgive   Anyway, the problem is, it's difficult to disentangle such a strong cultural stereotype from an actual psychological difference in gender.  However, there are proxies to examine this.  For example, we know that men have higher testosterone than women.  Further, we know that giving women testosterone, makes them less empathetic, suggesting that there is a link between testosterone and empathy.    Thus, and this is where we get a little speculative, it's not difficult to imagine that because high testosterone is associated with both low empathy but also strength and 'manliness' -- 'manliness' became directly associated with low empathy.   Said another way, if we constantly are seeing the biggest, manliest men portraying less empathy, then we eventually learn that not showing empathy is a good way of signaling our manliness.  Of interest, this may also be why we have associations with being a homosexual (which appears be related to lower fetal testosterone), and lower manliness, etc. and why doing something that shows emotion is often insulted by fellow men as being a 'pussy' / wimp / etc.  I think this comedy sketch is relevant too!

I don't have any sources, but to me it seems like the stigma against male vulnerability has decreased in recent years. My impression is that for men a few generations back, being tough was a norm that wasn't questioned much. Boys got in fights and called sissys and stuff, but it was quite a stigma to not be manly. It seems that the Bill Burr comedy is reacting to that --- for him and his friends there is still some stigma, but it's not actually that bad to not be tough, which is why it's funny. From my personal experience, it seems like the stigma has decreased even less, to where I haven't heard anybody make a homosexual joke in years (I live in a city with a large homosexual population where gay marriage is legal).  I think my friends are much more vulnerable than average, but I would be very surprised to have seen articles such as Daniel radcliff on the unhealthy stigma of male vulnerability published 20 or 30 years ago when male celebrities where extremely macho.  So what I'm talking about is something not biological, but a cultural change. While men may be lower on empathy than women, why is it more acceptable now for them to show it?"

Now, I'm no historian, but I'd wager it was our re-conceptualizing of gender vs. sex and other related feminist ideas that have permeated into our collective conscious.  Subsequently, we now have a culture that draws a distinction between biological sex and someone's gender.  Further, it was likely considered taboo to act against the norms of one's sex.

Another thing people don't often know is that the p-value is tlnot the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis (ie favoring the claim that isnt true) it is actually the probability of seeing the correlation in a sample pulled from a population that doesnt have the correlation of the sample.

AskSocialScience,2zwx6l,wbmccl,13,Sun Mar 22 19:23:00 2015 UTC,"This is a difficult thing to say, not because it is hard to define what 'equal pay' means in the context of gender (it should mean that there is no statistically significant difference in pay attributable to gender), but because it is difficult to separate gender from the other attributes that impact wages.  In general, a simple but ideal econometric study for the question would be set up as such: collect a large amount of panel data on income that allows individuals to be identified over time according to a large set of personal characteristics (age, gender, marital status, education, etc.) and professional characteristics (job level, professional field, etc.). Then develop a model where the dependent variable is income and the independent variables are all relevant personal characteristics that affect income. Test whether you can reject the hypothesis that the coefficient for gender = 0. If all relevant features have been included and you reject the hypothesis that the coefficient for gender = 0, you can assume that an inequality exists based on gender. Any level that is statistically significant can be called unequal—it is a normative question what level is deemed 'allowable'.  The problem is that it's not easy to capture all relevant factors. This study is a fine example of this. They shrink the gap to about 7 cents, but it's not clear that what remains is purely gender. There are a lot of unobserved differences, but some may well be gender specific. And some 'non-gender' differences may have their root in past discrimination. A challenging topic."

You're talking about the interpretation of the correlations between the covariates.   Whatever data you get for education will be correlated with your binary gender term and bias its coefficient.    If you control for education, job and gender, the correlations between education, job and gender will not bias your coefficient estimates. Only something not included in the regression can bias your estimates.   I think your criticism does not really challenge the model specification, rather it challenges the interpretation of the estimates. We can perform something like an Oaxaca decomposition to see what percentage of the wage gap we estimate comes from differences in level of education, or differences in job choice between men and women, but do we attribute those differences to valid personal agency, or do we attribute them to sexism and social pressure?

No, I'm talking about subtleties not captured by the data. That is a sample problem, not a theory problem, to which the term multicollinearity absolutely applies. Whether multicollinearity is a serious problem is indeed an interpretation - I assert that, in this case, it is. We don't do econometrics by throwing around Stata commands and seeing what sticks. We do econometrics by specifying an econometric model (which is usually modeled after an economic model) and fitting it to data. We are a priori interpreting our estimates, even before those estimates exist. The data doesn't magically tell you to put education, job, and gender together - you as the researcher have decided that those variables matter. I hope you're getting at the notion that the wage gap is a matter of interpretation because we can't refine our data any further, which is an important thing to say, but I think it still stands that some of the ways people try to clarify the error term are deleterious (in part precisely because they're trying to avoid interpretation, which is inherently impossible).    but do we attribute those differences to valid personal agency, or do we attribute them to sexism and social pressure?   And do we attribute statistically and practically significant differences in valid personal agency to sexism, or biology, or the giant lobster in the sky? I'm not trying to tackle the big questions here (feel free to go through my post history, where I do).

There really isn't. There is correlation between the independent variables and many confounds yes, and we have to be very careful about claims of causation of course, but there is not inherently a collinearity issue in these types of models.   Where you're really wrong is in asserting in a comment above that if you regress wage on gender and education, the correlation between gender and education biases the estimates. This is not true.

My methodology was an ideal and simple set-up that imagines all features are captured and represented independently. Of course in this sort of analysis that's not practical for the reasons you give, plus the fact that many causes of differences in pay may be unobservable or lack quality instruments.

There is a gap between wages of men and women.  The debate is whether it is economically significant. Can we attribute the gap to factors other than statistical discrimination?  Even correcting for a multitude of factors, the most comprehensive studies Ive read show a small but statistical difference exists. Of course, we can't say it's discrimination because we are deducing, not inducing.  So we can only say that it's not because of observed factors of education, experience, full time status, industry, etc.   I see the debate really about whether there is an economic significance. Is the remainder of 3% (or between 4-2% depending on the study) of economic significance - is there a reason we should be concerned as a society. People on one side say yes, others say no.  The answer depends on what policies exist to correct the difference and whether those policies are worth the cost. That is a subjective question because it requires assessing individual values of equality for its own sake.   My own view is that even 3% is a concern. Furthermore, I also believe that differences in career choice, stemming from this like choice of major or how well specific industries are open to more flexible work schedules for families, are still a concern even if it isn't discrimination per SE."

AskSocialScience,2ztz1k,sinenox,36,Sat Mar 21 19:22:37 2015 UTC,"The fundamental problem of elephant poaching is demand for ivory, which has decreased in the US and Europe but significantly increased in China because of economic growth which allowed people who always wanted ivory to afford it (Stiles). There are two schools of thought on how to deal with this problem:     Satiate demand. Some people (Stiles) advocate that you need a legal market such that people who want Ivory will be able to buy it and snuff out the illegal black market of poaching.  In this view, stockpiles should be sold off to satiate demand.  Extinguish demand. Others argue that we have to change cultural preferences to kill demand. In this view, allowing the legal ivory market to exist does nothing to hinder demand and will lead to elephant killing (Rice). In this view stockpiles should be destroyed and preferences changed.     The critique of point (1) is that the countries with poaching problems are corrupt and will allow illegal ivory to enter the legal trade (Bennett). This is because the officials on the ground are underpaid and willing to accept a cut of the ivory profits in exchange for labeling illegal ivory as legal or allowing poaching.    If you agree with view (2) and think creating a legal market is impossible in light of corruption, then you should want to change preferences for ivory ASAP. Destroying the stockpiles makes sense, you dont want to reward people for buying them.   As far as effectiveness goes, Rice observes that demand for ivory INCREASED after CITES allowed a 1 time stockpile sale in the 1990s and 2000s, arguing that selling ivory increased demand for it. Stiles instead argues that demand grew independently because of the Chinese economic boom. I think a middle route is that the Chinese boom is a driver, but the one-time sale definitely did not help stop poaching.   (1) Rice, M. Legal ivory trading severely undermines elephant conservation (2) Stiles, D. The inconvenient truth about the ivory trade. Ecologist. (3) Bennett, E.

AskSocialScience,2ztz1k,iamqba,2,Sun Mar 22 02:01:08 2015 UTC,"How did selling ivory increase demand for it?  Was it reduction in price, or did demand scale with availability, or what?"
AskSocialScience,2ztz1k,sllewgh,5,Sun Mar 22 05:38:07 2015 UTC,"So the argument Rice makes is that the one time exception in the law created ""confusion"" about the law which created demand. I think that argument is extremely weak and shows a poor understanding of economics.    However, it is reasonable to believe that if you're trying to change consumption patterns, making the item more available runs counter to the stated goal. If the US is trying to curb ivory consumption, but ivory is not illegal to buy, just trade internationally, and all of a sudden places have more ivory I can see how buyers would be confused."

To my reckoning, it seems pretty plausible that increasing the supply would decrease the normally very high price.  That high price makes it a status symbol- everyone wants it, and if the price drops, more can get it.  Is there some way that demand is measured besides sales?  Do we know there weren't people lining up around the block to buy this that just couldn't before the price dropped?  I guess the distinction is between reducing sales and reducing desire.  I don't see how destroying stockpiles is going to necessarily make anyone want it less, it just makes them less able to purchase it.  If that's the case, it's not going to have the desired effect of reducing poaching, and we should think of something else."

It has historical/cultural significance and associations with the elite. Decreasing the price would enable people who previously couldn't afford ivory to purchase it, which would swamp the reduction in purchases by the super wealthy that are no longer interested. Furthermore, even if raw ivory is cheaper, intricately carved quality pieces with gold inlays would still be extremely expensive and sought after by the wealthy."

I was writing my earlier comment from my phone, and am surprised and disappointed that the mods deleted it, but whatever; their sub, their rules. Now that I'm in front of a computer, I can maybe say a little more, and I've pulled up a paper that might interest you.  First, though, I can understand your desire to have concrete examples. But, to state the obvious, it's inherently difficult to get reliable and detailed data on black markets, and without that, you're more or less forced to theorize about incentives, markets, consumer desires, and human nature, which usually does force you back to relying on interviews, reporting, journalism, and other messier and more anecdotal kinds of evidence. Oh, and in this case the paucity of data doesn't just relate to the illicit ivory trade; we don't even have reliable figures on how many elephants there are, which is why a major effort is now underway to conduct an elephant census.  There is one excellent recent paper that you might have already seen — by Michael ’t Sas-Rolfes et al. in the journal Pachyderm last year — that goes through what data there are relating to ivory poaching rates, stockpiles, etc. They explain with care where the statistics that we have come from. Arguably the authors trust what data they have more than they should, but their analysis seems reasonable. At one point, they even pose a thought experiment somewhat similar to the one you raised in your original post (""take all of the ivory you seize and airdrop it all over the landscape""). Maybe most intriguingly, they argue that there's a possibility that rising prices may be caused less by high demand for ivory products than by market speculation — but when you look closely, they don't have a lot to back up that notion. Anyway, I hope this paper can be of use."
AskSocialScience,2zvy1e,tayaravaknin,6,Sun Mar 22 07:48:15 2015 UTC,"If you read some of the more critical literature on US politics many argue that the deficit hawks are just using the fear of debt as a means to cut social programs. This should be obvious since they tend to cut relatively small, but important, programs and leave massive subsidies are war spending. Dems want more spending but the hawks claim it will lead to some kind of financial Armageddon.   The question is why is debt so dangerous? Right now the US is at a level where most states face lower credit ratings and worry of short-term default. The hawks use this fear to get what they want.  But obviously the US isn't just any state. While not focusing on the debt barry Eichengreen wrote about the US' ""Exorbitant Privilege"" by way of the dollar. While most states have the value of their currency based on their domestic production the US has inherent value in the dollar as a global currency. As such, demand for the dollar and treasury bonds will continue because every other actor wants them as well. It is heavily delinked from the health (or debt) of the state. As such, the US is less vulnerable compared to other states.  Because of this high demand (goods and other currencies are priced in dollars and is the primary reserve currency) is also means we will have less inflation and cheaper credit. So why not borrow when prices are low? Cut programs to pay off debt when it is unnecessary?  There is also the benefit of seigniorage, that the US is the only entity that can print dollars. Internationally other states get loans in dollars and have to sell it's own currency to pay it back in dollars, leading to devaluation, making it even harder to pay back. At least in some portion (for worry of inflation) the US can also just print more dollars to pay off debt, since it's debt is also in dollars.  Finally, the US economy is really strong enough to pay back such a high debt eventually so there is no real worry of default (this also keeps the price of debt down). Many of the leading economies (US, Japan, UK) are able to carry higher debt/GDP than smaller states, to whom shifts in the global economy will affect more.   Those are some reasons why it isn't necessary. For why it isn't necessarily good Eichengreen brings up the point that because the US dollars determines global liquidity and makes up the primary reserve currency the US needs to have extra dollars around the world.   A good example of this is the high Asian savings rate, especially with China. The other side to this is high debt in the US. To some degree the US is a kind of ""consumer of last resort"". If the US shifted policy greatly to pay down it's debt that global demand will dry up and Asia will have fewer markets to sell it's goods, perhaps go in a recession. Maybe then sell of it's dollars?  As you can tell that's probably not a great system to have, and because it's based on asymmetric savings/debt it will probably have to shift the other way eventually. Nonetheless, having the dollars as a global currency makes debt cheaper and in some aspects is a cost (with the benefits mentioned) to have it so."
AskSocialScience,2ztyq9,sangneuf,9,Sat Mar 21 19:19:51 2015 UTC,"My interests are in realism and institutionalism as they relate to IR and the geopolitics of treaty negotiation, which hopefully adds to your thread.  For one thing we need to nail down what we mean by ""international order."" The obvious choices are (1) a military balance of power and (2) a system of global economic governance, and perhaps (3) the production of global public goods.  The question of military balance was the defining feature of the Cold War, but has been unclear since the early 1990's. Nuclear weapons, and institutions like the UNSC, have meant that major world wars are much less likely. This has served to reduce ""balancing"" behavior to threats rather than strickily speaking to ""power"" (See Walt on balance of threat contra Waltz on balance of power).  Nevertheless, there has been a great deal of debate about unipolarity v. multipolarity and hegemonic unilateralism v. multilateralism, about which version of international order is preferable (see Wohlforth; Ikenberry; Kupchan; Layne; Krauthammer; and Mastranduno for this aspect of the IR debate). Any state that isn't a permanent member of the Security Council, however, is dissatisfied with the international order (Germany, Japan, India, and Brazil come to mind first but not last).  Regarding the economic governance side of things, the IMF, World Bank, WTO, G-7 and other predominantly ""Western"" economic institutions have brought the global economy a greater amount of stability than what we would expect in their absence, but this does not mean that they are universally loved (especially in the global South).  Then there is the question of global public goods that the UN attempts to provide. In the environmental world, perhaps in particular, the leaders of the global South are interested in increasing their structural power and material transfers (see Krasner) but are mostly unwilling to participate in the actual provision of public goods (this is to be left to the Western powers who caused all of these problems).  This attitude, sometimes very reasonable, sometimes less so, is the reason that the US since 2000 has been trying to encourage China and India to become responsible stakeholders (see Zoellick; Patrick; and Economy on the problem of irresponsible stakeholders).  Then you have the problem of what we mean by ""Western?""  It used to mean transatlantic allies (and Japan + Australia). But in the 1990's the EU worked very hard to differentiate itself from the US and pursue what was called ""normative"" power (see Manners 2002 on defining what is ""normal"" behavior for the international community) in addition to structural foreign policy which like the G-77 sought to leverage new governance mechanisms to increase their power both regionally and globally (see Keukeleire for this).  The result is that ""Western"" means different things to different people.  A number of IR and Geopolitics people including Doran, Modelski, Gilpin, and others, discuss power cycles or power transitions as a normal part of a dynamic world equilibrium.  The problem is that international law (and institutions) are much better at regulating a static order with path dependent institutions than dynamic power shifts. This makes participation feel like musical chairs when the system is in flux.  This is the problem, or rather question, with China: how will it adapt to and support the current order, seek to shape the current order, or seek to destroy and replace the current order?  Drezner has argued that China is adapting and supporting on the economic front. The irresponsible stakeholder group argue that China is free riding (the same claim is made against the US for its ""a la carte multilateralism""). And a number of people argue that the expansionary actions in the South China Sea (as well as tacit support of Russia/Iran/Venezuela/Sudan revisionism) and the creation of the BRICS Bank and AIIB is a signal of increasing appetite for revision as China grows in power.   My own view, although hardly unique, is that while we needn't be too worried about Red Dawn scenarios, an increasingly diffuse, heterogeneous, and fragmented world order is likely to be defined more by neo-mercantilism and irresponsible stakeholderism from declining as well as emerging great powers. In a world more likely to be defined by security threats from environmental/natural disasters, resource scarcity, and pandemics rather than hegemonic wars, we can expect more disorder than order from the dynamic and entitled middle and great powers (including China)."
AskSocialScience,2ztyq9,sangneuf,4,Sat Mar 21 22:22:48 2015 UTC,"I received a PM asking if I was referencing Russia when I mention declining powers. Here is my response:  So yes, Russia is certainly a declining power but as the Crimea/Ukraine crisis makes clear, they suffer from a real dislocation between the respect they get from the international community and what they think they deserve.   In addition to the strategic benefit of Crimea's warm water port, there also seems to be a truculent sort of fuck you attitude with regard to NATO and the US. This makes no sense to Americans but apparently resonates with the Russian people more than we might think is rational.  The problem, discussed by Doran; Gilpin; and Modelski, is that this is what we can expect from declining powers. They jealously hang on to the power they have and unreasonably demand more respect than they deserve.  This is a problem because the ""West"" is also in decline relative to the persistent growth rates of China and perhaps India. So we shouldn't be surprised by ""exceptionalist"" behavior from the US, and Europe.  This clashes with China and India, who are recognized to be growing in power, but who quite frankly have a very long way to go to match Europe for standard of living and the US for military power. They have started to expect a seat at the table and influence that exceeds what they deserve.   Historically, when these upward trends meet downward trends and everyone feels more entitled than they should, cooperation leads to competition, then to rivalry, and unfortunately to conflict (as in hegemonic war to end all wars).   So yes, Russia is a problematic declining power but so are we in the West (or at least we're on a similar path) and this is why China watching is such a huge preoccupation for so many policy wonks.

AskSocialScience,2ztyq9,sangneuf,2,Sun Mar 22 12:37:00 2015 UTC,"First, some caveats: I'm a grad student and I'm not in security studies. This limits my ability to properly address the military side of this question.  Second, in spite of the caveats, in the IR and geopolitics fields, and in my own opinion, the prevailing assessment is that China is not planning a hegemonic war with the US. This was the way supremacy was contested before the twentieth century, but with nuclear weapons the cost of hegemonic war is too large. Even without nukes, you can increase your relative power by growing your GDP more than by defeating your rival in military battle. (This is also why I suggest neo-mercantilism as a continuing and growing concern).  Third, this does not mean we can expect peace and harmony.  China poses a threat to small states within its sphere of influence, just like Russia poses a threat to Ukraine and small states in its sphere of influence.   The big question, as it relates to a managed transition of power is the potential for the ""West"" to sanction China, like they have with Russia. Even if it were possible to do this on the same scale as with Russia, it would have such a massive effect on the global economy, it would be very difficult to sustain it.  This problem, called the Sanctioner's Dilemma [pdf warning] where the cost of punishing a free rider is more than the individual benefit of doing so is very real.  In closing, you can expect Russia and China to keep pushing the limits of the existing order while they work to create a competing order in areas where they benefit from doing so. Either international support will tip over to the new model or will force the old model to be more accommodating.  Either way, we're in the transition."

If you're interested in economic statecraft definitely check out Baldwin, as well as Drezner on sanctions, but I ran into some articles by Leslie Elliott Armijo on financial statecraft that may give you a sense of alternative tools of statecraft.  It seems logical that the ""stans"" become the next hegemonic battlefield, especially with all of the talk about a new silk road but I think this will mainly be Russian tinkering. The American people just don't care enough to bother.  We'll certainly hear more chatter from the hawks, but the US has as much interest in engaging in a proxy war with China as they do with Russia. Some but not enough.  I'd keep my eye on influence balancing with India and a couple of Southeast Asian countries and efforts to support increasingly worried states. Vietnam and Myanmar comes to mind but there will be others.  However, I think the more interesting question is Chinese internal politics. It's very easy to see China as this unstoppable force but after years of massive growth (and considerable domestic unrest), it would not surprise me to see serious problems in the event of an economic bubble bursting.  Then, like Ross Perot said, ""you'll hear a giant sucking sound"" but this time it will be China calling in all of its loans to deadbeat states around the world. This would massively upset soft power diplomacy we've seen increasing in recent years. Moreover, many states are cozying up to China because they consume so many raw materials. When they stop consuming, most of those states will happily trade them for new ""allies."" We'll also see more hawkishness to deflect populist rage.  What I'm getting at is that, on the one hand, hegemony is theirs to lose. As autocrats, they are likely to be their own worst enemy.  On the other hand, we can expect that soft-balancing economic and financial statecraft will be used against them, not as a single devastating assault, but just enough to frustrate and constrain."

The thing to keep in mind is that ""global"" during the Concert of Europe, before WW1, then before WW2, then the Cold War, then post-Cold War, all mean something different.

The thing is all of today's great powers have nukes, so new forms of contestation other then hegemonic war are necessary. Whether this is possible without destroying the Western liberal international order remains to be seen.   The good news is that because Germany lost WW1 and WW2, the last transition was between Great Britain and the US was bumpy but peaceful (at least between GB and the US) mainly because GB was bankrupt at the end of WW2.

I am a PhD candidate in topics of national identity and I can tell you that it is not an easy distinction as they are related in some sense and both are terms whose definition is highly contested. If you are aware of Anthony Smith then I am sure you are aware of the great debate within nationalism studies between Smith and Ernest Gellner. While this was a debate over the origins of nations it also strongly tied to the conversation about how ethnicity is related to the modern day nation. You have already quoted Smith's view that nations are bound to the notion of a shared ancestry. However, Gellner (more specifically in his book ""Nations and Nationalism"") took a modernist perspective stating the nations are modern phenomenon tied to the industrial revolution where shared ancestry and common ethnicity is not a requirement for membership. These two views over the origins of nations still exist and are not likely to be resolved any time soon. You can also look at other modernist theorists such Benedict Anderson (in his book ""Imagined Communities"") to help understand the relationship between nations and ethnicities. Anderson defines the nation as an imagined community that is highly dependent on the spread vernacular language and print capitalism. He also makes some interesting connections with colonialism, arguing that the first modern nations emerged out of colonial rule where the colonist inadvertently created the foundation for national creation. So I guess your answer depends on how you view and define nations. Since there are many theorists of nationalism (I can refer you to more if you like) that define the origins of nations with such varied perspectives in relation to ethnicities it may be helpful to choose which side of the debate you prefer to lie before you try to tackle how these two terms relate.

Growth generally causes inflation.   The Keynesian vs. Neo-Classical is the main fight   There hasn't actually been much of a fight for going on 30 years.

Recent work has mostly focused on multipliers and what modifies them.   Basically, Neo-Classical argument is that we should do away with sticky economics, for example sticky wages or sticky prices and make employment flexible   Again the synthesis is important here, New-Keynesian work focuses on explaining nominal rigidity within a rational expectations (and lots of other avenues) framework. Even the work of the grand wizard himself, Lucas, doesn't preclude nominal rigidity.   It is basically the argument that market will fix itself, where instead of having contracts dictate what should be done for the next months or years, let the market decide whenever it needs to.

AskSocialScience,2zrxrw,mosestrod,11,Sat Mar 21 16:03:01 2015 UTC,"Marxist thinkers argue that there are several inherent problems with the way that capitalism works that should lead to its downfall. David' Harvey's 17 Contradictions and the End of Capitalism is a pretty readable introduction to this way of thinking by one of the leading living scholars of marxism.   There is a lot written on this topic, but one of the major contradictions is related to the conflict between capitalists (the people who own businesses) and workers (the people who make things for the business). Capitalists need to maximize their profit because they've borrowed money to invest in their business. In mature markets, one of the only ways to make a profit is to reduce your workers' wages or to employ fewer of them by being more productive (which is what those investments do, but new machines to make fewer workers more productive).   But.....those workers use those wages to buy products. If their wages drop too low, they can't buy more products, meaning that profit drops. To counteract this capitalists will have to reduce their prices, and the only way to do this is to lower wages!   So, obviously capitalism hasn't collapsed yet. Why not given this inherent contradiction? One thing that capitalists can do to forestall a crisis is to open up new markets. You can go to low cost regions to find cheeper workers or you can find new customers somewhere else. But this can only last so long, there are developing markets but there really aren't that many untapped markets. Capitalists are still trying though. The sub-prime mortgage crisis was in many ways an attempt to create new markets in the developed world by providing cheep credit to people who no longer had high enough wages to consume.   There are other arguments about why capitalism doesn't collapse given the internalized contradictions. Regulation theory argues that the state plays an important role in creating stable markets for capitalism to grow by negotiating the implicit contract between capital and labour."

AskSocialScience,2zrxrw,MyShitsFuckedDown2,18,Sat Mar 21 15:15:00 2015 UTC,"Mathematically, there is something that prevents capitalism from working. It's called the rate of profit. And there is a tendency for it to fall over time (with countervailing tendencies). This is called the tendency for the rate of profit to fall which was described originally (incorrectly) by bourgeois economists (Smith and Ricardo) but then fixed by Karl Marx in Capital Volume 3.  The reason as to why this happens is kinda hard to wrap your head around, especially since I would have to basically describe Capital to you for everything to make sense. So I'll try to do a tl;dr version. Keep in mind that value cannot be made in exchange (Marx thoroughly disproves that in chapter 5 of volume 1) and therefore there must be a commodity that produces value (labor). Furthermore, keep in mind that the labor theory of value relies on the average labor time it takes to make a commodity (socially necessary labor time or SNLT). If it takes 5 hours to make a shoe and it takes me 10 hours, it does not make my shoe more valuable.  There are 3 variables I'm going to look at: c, v, and s. C is constant capital (raw materials and machines for example), v is variable capital (labor), and s is surplus value (unpaid labor). Over time, capitalists find new ways to increase productivity. A computer, giant drills, cars, whatever it may be. For the capitalist that uses it first, he can produce more items than everybody else (the labor time for his is less than the SNLT) and he starts to put everybody else out of business. His profits are super profits, and that's why he looks for these new inventions. When everybody else catches up, the SNLT goes down and therefore the value of each object goes down too.  Unfortunately for the capitalists, these machines (the c) are not free. The workers are still working as much as they ever are, but the costs have gone up. Therefore what we would call the organic composition of capital (OCC) (which is the ratio between c and v: c/v) has increased. What does this mean? Well, now let's look at profits. Profits would be s/(c+v). Over time OCC raises, so v becomes irrelevant. So then the equation would become s/c. But wait a second, we know that s is unpaid labor. Unless workers work longer (or there are more of them) or are getting paid less, s isn't going to get bigger. So the more the OCC raises, the smaller profits are going to be. This is exactly what happens, and so something has to give when profits fall too low. This is a type of crisis (recession for example). The price of c in this profitability crisis falls, so then profits are at least partially restored. Then the crisis for a while is resolved.  Again more bad news for the capitalists. This countervailing tendency isn't enough (there are others but they are less powerful so I'm going to ignore them for this post) to really restore profit back to there highest point. Profitability is going down, and has been for a long time. Andrew Kliman in his book The Failure of Capitalist Production: Underlying Causes of the Great Recession talks about profitability with data included. Esteban Maito also came out with a paper recently where he shows the rate of profit since the 19th century.  I wrote this kinda quickly so I hope I didn't condense too much.  Resources:  Kliman, Andrew. The Failure of Capitalist Production: Underlying Causes of the Great Recession. N.p.: Pluto, 2011. Print.  Maito, Esteban Ezequiel.

On the broader point of the falling rate of profit, which is generally true. Capitalism have found fantastic ways to keep that rate of profit from falling too far, mostly by transforming the system from the Smithian conception of petty bourgeois to a corporatist structure that enshrines oligarchy and thereby keeps marginal s(c+v) from reaching zero.   This does not mean that capitalism will ""end"" - only that it will transform itself, if you think it has not done so already, into an oligarchy maintained by capture of regulatory agencies of the state.  Capitalism's saving grace over the 20th century has been what Schumpeter called the tendency for creative destruction - the inability of entrenched oligarchs to maintain a monopoly on innovation. The structure of capitalism is more amenable to such disruptive innovation than Sovet-style economies - this is what allows companies like Google or Apple or Facebook to overturn the corporate landscape.

More below.   Sure, if I had to make one criticism of /u/stopstopp's presentation it'd be that they make the mistake of conflating crisis theory with the end of capitalism itself. On the terms of Marxian crisis theory, whether you accept it or not, the theory of the tedendency of the rate of profit to fall is an explanation of why capitalism falls into crisis. It is not a theory of why capitalism itself will end. That is, there's a difference between saying ""here's a theory why capitalism falls into crisis' and 'capitalism will end because of its tendency towards crisis'.   Marxist economists recognize that many factors can restore a functioning capitalist economy. In fact, if Paul Sweezy's to be believed then capitalism can inprinciple continue on forever with proper regulatory oversight of various forms.

As for the creative capacity of capitalism, I don't dispute that and don't think any professional Marxist economist would. It's however somewhat beside the point of whether that can sustain such an economic system indefinitely. I think it's taken for granted that capitalism is going to always be around despite the fact its success has only been within a couple hundred years over the scope of thousands of years of human history."

I can't think of a single person who claims to be Marxist yet has 'abandoned' his labour theory of value (LTV) (several often do downplay it or problematically interpret it such as Harvey). And I spend a considerably unhealthy amount of my time readings Marxists. You simply cannot be a Marxist if you don't 'believe' in the LTV, Marx himself considered it his greatest contribution (along perhaps with what would later be called 'dialectical materialism'). So all we're left is a column of bourgeoisie 'expert' opinions stating that Marx is either dead or abandoned, as if those people ever accepted it in the first place, as if it didn't always stand as a critique of that 'expert opinion'. The reality is more than any other social theorist, economist or philosopher, Marx's predictions concerning capitalism (derived from the LTV) have been proved correct.  Of course for the myriad of commentators of Marx, it is a common theme to hear his ideas being noted as 'historically interesting' or 'partially correct' or 'good theory bad practice'; essentially how academia treats Marx. In reality of course his LTV and critique of capitalism resting upon it is one of the greatest contributions to social theory ever, no matter what those who cannot understand it say.   if you think it has not done so already, into an oligarchy maintained by capture of regulatory agencies of the state.   The libertarians et al. who love such a discourse always reach problems when actually attempting a history of this notion. If this is true, under which period did it take place? In the end it explains nothing. Why did capital experience a crisis in the 1960s and 70s? Why did financialisation massively accelerate thereafter, globalisation and so on? And why was the rate of profit highest during the 'golden age' of the Keynesian corporatist welfare state? Over the period of the last 30 years the 'regulatory agencies of the state' have been generally disassembled or reduced, rather than maintained but 'taken over'. Of course it should come as no surprise that the state serves capital, but the form this relationship takes and the content it implies is determined by the rate of return on capital itself. The rate of profit was high in the post-war era and thus a large state and a stable working-class could 'be afforded'. In a situation of declining profitability the state itself becomes a source of profit (privatisations, out-sourcing etc.). Of course capital will attempt many thing to mediate and delay the problem of profitability, but they cannot escape it insofar as they create it.   The structure of capitalism is more amenable to such disruptive innovation than Sovet-style economies - this is what allows companies like Google or Apple or Facebook to overturn the corporate landscape.   Exactly. The only thing that could stop capitalism motoring towards its down death would be if it stopped, or considerably slopped that motor, i.e. competition. Which as you suggest is always the desire of individual capitalists, and some possibility of doing so is glimpsed at through control of state agencies. Insofar as it can never stop competing, that the new companies you suggest emerge, capital as a whole will continue to face a profitability crisis."

The basic problem is that the gold nugget in question isn't a commodity that would fall under the scope of Marx's LTV. The reasons why are explained straightforwardly in an older post here As a suggestion, you'll find that the professional critics of the LTV don't make such silly mistakes when attempting to discredit the Marxian LTV.   To quote Marginalist Economist Mark Blaug, from his book 'Economic Theory in Retrospect':  ""We conclude our discussion by raising a difficult question provoked by the study of Marxian economics. What is the appropriate level of abstraction for an economic theory? Debates between Marxists and orthodox economists invariably break down over the nature of the questions that economics ought to answer. When both schools of thought turn to the same questions, they do not really reach different results. As a theory of relative prices, for example, the labour theory of value is nothing but a static theory of general equilibrium, applicable to any closed exchange economy regardless of the character of property ownership, provided the input coefficients of production are given by purely technical considerations and perfect competition prevails. The labour theory of value is a special case of the more general Walrasian theory. Marxists themselves do not argue that orthodox price theory is wrong but merely that its findings are not very interesting. Similarly, when a Marxist and a bourgeois economist turn to the question of long-run economic development under capitalism, there disagreements are not traceable to matters of fact and logic, but to specific sociological assumptions that each regards as appropriate to a meaningful analysis of the problem.""  Now, Blaug still rejects Marxian economics on methodological grounds but you wont find him in his work on Marx making such silly reddit-style arguments. His main arguments against Marx can be found in a little lecture series entitled 'A Methodological Appraisal of Marxian Economics'. I don't agree with Blaug's appraisal myself, but it's one anyone who's interested in the subject should get familiar with."

Price and value are different, and Marx's theory of value is not an argument about the price of any individual object. It's also not an argument about the value of any individual object: it's an argument for viewing the value of commodities as something socially determined. The argument is that the primary driving force of capitalism is not people finding gold nuggets - what would they do with them if that's all they did and there was no labor or technological change? - but by competition in terms of the rate of profit driven in large part by ""beating"" the socially necessary labor time.  Sure, I might go find a gold nugget. Most gold, however, is mined, and that takes labor and time. The productivity of gold miners on average, however, is a function of technology and so on. If you can develop practices, tools, machinery, or drugs that enable your workers to do more in the same period of time as your competitors' workers, you have an edge.  If everyone does the same thing, though, the socially necessary labor time has changed. You don't have an edge anymore. The reason finding a gold nugget would be so damn awesome is precisely that for most people most of the time, an average amount of time and labor go into obtaining that amount of gold. Those averages pull price in certain ways (without fixing it), and you just beat them. Lucky you.  For what it's worth, Marx treats gold as something of an exception; but the point still stands that while price is going to fluctuate due to a plethora of factors, there are societal norms of efficiency and output (again determined by technology and the like) that capitalists try to exceed. The relationship between value and price is such that one of the many factors that influences price is the socially necessary labor time required to produce the good - the time and effort that go into bringing a commodity into a market economy on average.  I see your interpretation of Marx's theory of value being peddled all the time - primarily by people who've never read Capital."

To his credit, Marx typically avoided making strongly quantitative claims in Capital, whilst presenting a critique that was otherwise self-consistent and conditionally complete to the standards of philosophy at the time (even by most modern standards).

Automated system, and robots etc. don't have these problems, since not only can they be specifically moulded to a particular production process, they also don't experience any (or little) of the problematic issues involved in human labour (i.e. tiring, sleep, rest etc.). Competition forces capitalists ever forward to increase profit margins and so on. However the obvious benefits to individual capitalists of automation is not a general benefit for capital overall, since removing the human part of production also severs the corollary of production; exchange. The problem with humans is you have to pay them a wage, however it's that wage that also ultimately the energy of production (via. consumption). Eradicating wage labour may be good for individual capitalists, but when generalised to capitalism as a whole a period of crisis ensures due to systemic underconsumption and mass unemployment. And unlike other periods this cannot be remedied. Since capitalism cannot 'go backwards' and adapt of production process less technologically advanced which may entail more human labour. Nor can new work be found since labour intensive work is generally the mostly, and first, to be automated.   There's more and more talk about this phenomenon in the mainstream media and academia in general. Stats show the US labour force participation rate has returned to 1978 levels, and MIT researchers suggested 45% of existing jobs are 'at risk' from automation in the next 20 years alone. Despite this activity the analysis overall is vague and generally floundering in either a bewildered state unable to explain both this process and it's effects, or a technological fetishism which makes technology itself the determinant rather than the capitalism it serves.   The possibility of an existence without work is a joyous one. But insofar as capitalism must have work (wage-labour) it both must and will negate capitalism in the process of becoming. Capitalism digs it's own grave. No longer will human life be so endlessly sacrificed to capital in the name of endless toil, alienation, meaninglessness. Humanity can not only escape natures compulsion to work (since capitalism long ago made this possible) but also the compulsion to work by other humans. Where before “everything seemed pregnant with its contrary. Machinery, gifted with the wonderful power of shortening and fructifying human labor, we behold starving and overworking it…At the same pace that mankind masters nature, man seems to become enslaved to other men or to his own infamy.”1 The products of human labour liberate humans instead of alienating them. The central problem of essence vs. existence, of subject vs. object ends. The riddle of history is solved.   1 [Marx, MECW 14, pgs. 655-656]  edit: wording"

And how long did the ""transformation from agrarian to industrial society"" take exactly? Oh yeah about 200 years. As the MIT researchers suggest this is 45% loss in 20 years. That alone should give you a clue that this historical period is different to previous, that this level of technology is different to others (as if technologies progress is linear anyway).   and there is little in theory to support how displacement could possibly occur   hardly. To argue that jobs will just continually be found is dogmatism. You haven't stated anything contrary to what I wrote. Indeed the stats and general coverage in the media is problematic, that's exactly what I wrote.   We're talking about the end of capitalism, of course you're not going to get historic example of that. As for jobs having always previously been found, that just a mythic view of technology as if it always moves at the same pace with uniform results independent of the actual conditions it shapes and acts upon. Technology not destroying jobs in the transition from feudalism to industrialism or whatever is no argument against what I said. Your appeals to history rather make a mockery of it since you essentially negate history; the role technology plays in feudalism or agrarian society and it's transition is different to today because they are evidently different historical periods. To make your claim you have to dissolve history by assuming that what happened before will happen again, i.e. remove what makes these distinct historical periods in the first place.  Technology will destroy jobs for simply reasons. Jobs most easily automated are labour intensive. Technology is at a stage hitherto unseen, where previously there were always simply a class of jobs that couldn't be done by machines. Where before human labour was simply reduced (i.e. fordism) we have the possibility of it's complete absence, automated systems from factories to lorry driving set human labour free. The reasons why it previously didn't destroy jobs is simple because in the early 20thC their remained a whole sphere of life generally un-peirced by market logic. Hence the rise of the mass economy, mass culture, mass consumption. The potentials of technology have never been so great; there's a massive difference between new machines that increase production and decrease the rate of human intervention within it, since before technology was always still an appendage to human labour (making it faster, safer, easier, less tiring etc.). However todays moment is one where technology takes over completely. Farms running themselves, factories producing themselves, automated call centres.   There's also an atypical dystopian edge where there can be no end to capitalism. You will always spend most moments of your waking life in work you don't like, didn't chose, and don't need. Of course like any ruler capitalism can never see its end."

That's not a process or a system of processes, and it doesn't create nor does it reproduce racial domination (using a word does not change the social position of anyone involved in any meaningful way, after all).

Language and discourse are central to the reproduction of social existence. The language for example used when referring to black crime and black victims is (not only radically different from white) but organises a cognitive response conducive to racism. The language of subordination isn't separate to material ('real') subordination. Language is an open and diffuse way of reproducing a racial hierarchy by disciplining dispossessed races, by reproducing the notions, stereotypes, facets that define that race within that hierarchy, and by open assertion of a races position in a hierarchy that is de jure non-existent. However I think it's worthwhile to note that racism is always systemic and social, as such insulting a white person because of their 'race' isn't a racism because whites aren't oppressed. So you're right to imply the ambiguity of language, but even though it isn't in the final analysis the determinant of racial categories, racial categories couldn't exist without the language that reproduces and maintains them."

This is poor writing (friendly advice coming from someone who makes this mistake often and who judges people's writing for a living). Two: [citation needed]. You don't just expect us to accept your assumptions, right? Three: the word ""systemic"" leads to your proposition and logically justifies it, but the word ""social"" does not. In fact, many social science theories talk about the social and the system as being two entirely different ""layers"" of analysis, so by those typologies, you're really just throwing words out there.   as such insulting a white person because of their 'race' isn't a racism because whites aren't oppressed   There are two statements here. ""Insulting a white person because of their race isn't racism"" and ""whites aren't oppressed"". The second one is correct and undebatable. The first one is a result of your previous attempt to define/redefine the word racism, therefore its merits depend on people accepting your assumptions, which you give us no good reason to.

In fact, the way the meanings of words are shaped by its use is a topic for discussion all in itself.   Now, defining racism as needing an element of power is not a move I have seen being justified by any kind of analytical or theoretical necessity, and I feel like it is quite unnecessary for any kind of analytical framework/theoretical construction. It is, rather, an attempt to game the language.  I have a feeling that postmodernism and its tendencies to talk about language in a ""creative"" way (to say the very least) helps people feel free to do whatever they want with language (for an absolutely delicious - seriously, there is no better word - analysis of postmodernism language, check out this baby). That's just me, though.  Of substance, what I have to tell you in terms of your question is:  1) the definition most social justice enthusiasts/friends/fanatics use is ""prejudice + power"", not privilege;   2) Bonilla-Silva identifies the conception of racism as prejudice + power as coming from the 1970s, with two books from a political activist named Stokely Carmichael cited;  3) why don't you define racism as being ""prejudice + physical violence""? if people are just using whatever definition makes sense to them, make up something that makes sense to you (or make up some crazy ass shit and call it a deconstructionist move) and run with it. The first two pages of that Bonilla-Silva article basically show that every definition of racism is different, and they run the gamut from understanding racism as a belief, an ideology or a doctrine.

To Foucault, this corresponds to a modernization (mostly in the technological/scientific sense) of sovereign power and its exercise. In Society Must Be Defended, Foucault says:   “I think that one of the greatest transformations political right underwent in the nineteenth century was precisely that, I wouldn’t say exactly sovereignty’s old right- to take life or let live- was replaced, but it came to be complemented by a new right which does not erase the old right but which does penetrate it, permeate it. This is the right, or rather precisely the opposite right. It is the power to ‘make’ live and ‘let’ die. The right of sovereignty was the right to take life or let live. And then this new right is established: the right to make live and to let die.”   So basically the right to take life was complemented with the right/ability/interest to maximize life. Essentially, the body itself becomes a playing field for politics.  For further reading, check out one, two and three.

What do the lyrics and the people involved say about their expectations for men/women? What about the performances of men/women who are heavy metal artists?  from a thing I wrote:    We come to agreed notions and ideas that create the foundation of our experience, of what is possible, and what is impossible. Pierre Bordieu describes this foundation as the habitus, but there is also the hexis, which helps to determine one’s place and relation to others. The relationship between the two is close: the habitus gives us context, orientation, and a “feel” for the world without dictating our actions.2 The corporeal hexis is the way we embody those understandings, and carry them out through our own behaviors. Bordieu describes it as “a body technique, and specifically linguistic, especially phonetic, competence is a dimension of bodily hexis in which one's whole relation to the social world, and one's whole socially informed relation to the world. are expressed.”3  Perhaps if we can understand our bodily hexis, through the way we move, act, and especially how we talk, we can change those things, and change the value we have in both linguistics and social markets. This follows Butler’s observation that habitus is part of a “mutually formative relationship” with the dispositions it creates, and the linguistic and social values of those changes, actions, and effects of the hexis are indistinguishable.4   1 Mills, Sara, Discourse.

AskSocialScience,2zri7o,TectonicWafer,2,Sun Mar 22 18:34:10 2015 UTC,"Sorry, yes the word does have a different meaning: I'm using it in the sense of performativity. The idea is that communication can serve as an action which helps to both convey and construct our identity - it becomes real because we say it is. It's probably best associated with Judith Butler, who I cited above, and that piece I used really references Bourdieu's ideas heavily (my notes in []):   If a ""social position"" is produced in part through a repeated process of interpellation [this idea comes from Althusser, and says that ideology ""hails"" people in social interactions and puts them in their social place], and such interpellations do not take place exclusively through ""official"" means, could this reiterated ""being hailed into social existence"" not become the very occasion for a reappropriation of discursive power [power of speech acts, or actions of speech and communication], a further articulation of the habitus [see my last post], a ""regulated improvisation"", to use Bourdieu's terms. Further, if this ""unofficial"" operation of the social performative does become repeated and ritualized as a habitus, how would such a notion of performativity recast Bourdieu's notion of a corporeal history, the embodied history of having been called a name. One need only to consider how racial or gendered slurs live and thrive in and as the flesh of the addressee, and how these slurs accumulate over time, dissimulating their history, taking on the semblance of the natural, configuring and restricting the doxa that counts as ""reality"".   Really basically, performativity is usually understood as the way we enact our identities or enforce an ideal of behavioral and conceptual performance on others. The idea that some things/behaviors are ""manly"" versus ""girly,"" the way we dress and act towards people of the same versus the opposite sex, the food we imagine is acceptable for men versus women: these are all related to ideals of performance.  The example that Butler offers is related to race and it works if we ask ourself why we think of [insert ethnicity] culture the way we do: what communicative acts, properties, behaviors, do we associate with those identities? Are they truly representative or meaningful (do they apply to everyone who falls under that banner)? Performativity refers to the language of an ""act"" but by this it means actions - it doesn't suggest that those actions are contrived or inauthentic. In fact, the idea is that there is no real authenticity, only the socially constructed ideals enforced through performativity and communicative actions."
AskSocialScience,2zprdf,collectivecognition,15,Fri Mar 20 16:41:39 2015 UTC,"It looks like you're asking about gender-based pay/employment discrimination. For that, here's some recommended reading:  ""Gender Differences in Pay"" by Blau and Kahn  The whole thing is worth reading, but I'll highlight a few sections relevant to your question.   First, in 1997, Blau and Kahn find a pay gap between men and women of about 28%. Of that, 33% can be explained by human capital differences (in this case almost entirely differences in amount of years worked -- probably attributable to women spending more time at home as parents or homemakers). An additional 29% can be explained by occupation choice and union membership. So, a total of 62% of the wage gap is explained, leaving an unexplained wage gap of about 12% (the unexplained wage gap is what they say could be discrimination). That's still large, but not so terrible as 28%.  Of course, that study doesn't ask why women are choosing different occupations or whether or not women may have applied to a position and been rejected. So, the paper goes on to look more closely at some specific groups.   [One study investigates] graduates of the University of Michigan Law School classes of 1972-75, 15 years after graduation. The gap in pay between women and men was relatively small at the outset of their careers, but 15 years later, women graduates earned only 60 percent as much as men. Some of this difference reflected choices which workers had made, including the propensity of women lawyers to work shorter hours. But even controlling for current hours worked, as well as an extensive list of worker qualifications and other covariates, including family status, race, location, grades while in law school, and detailed work history data, such as years practiced law, months of part-time work, and type and size of employer, a male earnings advantage of 13 percent remained.   In this study, we have men and women who have chose very similar careers (they've all gone to law school) and we've controlled for a bunch of things and we still see an unexplained wage gap of about 13% (very close to the 12% number from above).  They talk about a few experiments that closely mirror your question (but since they are experiments they are quite a bit smaller scale):   Neumark (1996) analyzed the results of a hiring ""audit"" in which male and female pseudo job seekers were given similar resumes and sent to apply for jobs waiting on tables at the same set of Philadelphia restaurants. In high-priced restaurants, a female applicant's probability of getting an interview was 40 percentage points lower than a male's and her probability of getting an offer was 50 percentage points lower. A second study examined the impact of the adoption of ""blind"" auditions by symphony orchestras in which a screen is used to conceal the identity of the candidate (Goldin and Rouse, 2000). The screen substantially increased the probability that a woman would advance out of preliminary rounds and be the winner in the final round. The switch to blind auditions was found to explain between 25 and 46 percent of the increase in the percentage female in the top five symphony orchestras in the United States, from less than 5 percent of all musicians in 1970 to 25 percent today.    An indirect way of answering your question is to look at the profitability of firms that are willing to discriminate versus those that aren't:   Becker and others have pointed out that competitive forces should reduce or eliminate discrimination in the long run because the least discriminatory firms, which hire more lower-priced female labor, would have lower costs of production and should drive the more discriminatory firms out of business. For this reason, Becker suggested that discrimination would be more severe in firms or sectors that are shielded to some extent from competitive pressures. Consistent with this reasoning, Hellerstein, Neumark and Troske (1997) found that, among plants with high levels of product market power, those employing relatively more women were more profitable. In a similar vein, Black and Strahan (1999) report that, with the deregulation of the banking industry beginning in the mid-1970s, the gender pay gap in banking declined.   All of this is to say that there is definitely evidence that qualified women are looking for higher-paying jobs, but are not getting them for some reason that we haven't directly empirically observed. It could be discrimination or it could be something else that we don't know about (but... in my humble opinion, it's probably discrimination).  The size of the unexplained (possibly discriminatory) wage gap is smaller than the ""raw"" wage gap, but it is still real."

And if indeed you can show that oil companies on average increased their profit, it's going to be hard to actually say it was because of the Iraq War. It could be higher demand, emerging markets etc. A correlation does not imply a causation.  The US army and it's allies went into war with a huge amount of vechicles etc, that require oil derived products. Which the army had to buy from oil companies. So it stands to reason some oil companies profited from it, but I'm guessing that's not the way you're meaning it? The same way food companies profited from it, because soldiers have to eat."

AskSocialScience,2zol6v,Ummm_yeah_no,7,Fri Mar 20 09:16:30 2015 UTC,"The short answer is that advocating for any rule set over another, for whatever criteria is normative rather than positive.  Friedman (citing Keynes) writes a somewhat simplified delineation that most economists follow:   “a positive science ... a body of systematized knowledge concerning what is; a normative or regulative science...[,] a body of systematized knowledge discussing criteria of what ought to be...[,]an art... [,] a system of rules for the attainment of a given end”; comments that “confusion between them is common and has been the source of many mischievous errors”; and urges the importance of “recognizing a distinct positive science of political economy.”1   http://www.econ.umn.edu/~schwe227/teaching.s13/files/articles-sug/friedman-1953.pdf  Of course, there are nuances here and many argue that even so-called ""positive"" theories are value-laden   http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0361368282900198  You may also find this classic paper by Thaler enlightening on the distinctions  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167268180900517  The issue of Pareto Optimality is that it is both positive and normative depending on the theory it is used for.    We can say an outcome is Pareto Optimal in a positive sense - that it satisfies the criteria of satisfying preferences such that no ones preferences can be more satisfied without reducing another's.    The normative aspect appears when we use this observation to propose what society should do.  Does that satisfying of preference represent a social good - a desirable outcome?  That is not something that can be tested.  We can simply say that it satisfies preferences, but not whether it is in aggregate something that is desirable.    Of course, examples abound where Pareto Optimality is not a subjectively desirable outcome.  Primarily, we would be relying on the axiom of consumer sovereignty.  Specifically, that the satisfaction of preferences represent a desirable outcome in every situation, i.e. a consumer's preferences are synonymous with happiness or well-being.    For one, other aspects aside from value are morally good or bad.  Justice for example.  If a rapist values rape more than the victim would pay to prevent it, should society allow such pareto optimal outcomes to arise where rape occurs?    Alternatively, consumer choice may not reflect consumer well being.  Paternalism and altruism, for example, muck up the waters.  Does giving a child candy instead of broccoli represent a good thing for society?  What about adults who develop diabetes and heart problems?  We can always defer to consumer sovereignty, but that isn't an objective truth we can assert.  Its an axiom.    TLDR = any prescription relies on some subjective basis of good and bad, which are normative."

AskSocialScience,2zlga5,mrjosemeehan,42,Fri Mar 20 08:13:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know the direct answer to your question, but here are the expected consequences of higher voter turnout:  (1) If Everyone Had Voted, Would Bubba and Dubya Have Won?   Adapting and refining the approach used in earlier work on Senate elections, we simulate the impact of universal turnout on each presidential election from 1992 to 2004 and find little evidence that increased turnout would systematically transform partisan competition or policy outcomes. A state-level analysis of exit polls and the Current Population Survey reveals considerable variability in the gap separating voters and nonvoters. In most cases, nonvoters are just slightly more Democratic than voters. However, a handful of states, such as Texas, consistently feature a large “partisan differential,” in which nonvoters come disproportionately from demographic groups that are more Democratic than voters. We find that universal turnout may well have tipped an extremely close election—such as that of 2000 or even 2004—into the Democratic column. But the partisan differential is generally small enough that universal turnout would only change the outcome of an already close contest rather than leading to a wholesale transformation of competitive dynamics.   (2) Bryan Caplan argues in favor of Selective Participation in his, The Myth of the Rational Voter   Good intentions are ubiquitous in politics; what is scarce is accurate beliefs. The pertinent question about selective participation is whether voters are more biased than nonvoters, not whether voters take advantage of nonvoters. Empirically, the opposite holds: The median voter is less biased than the median nonvoter. One of the main predictors of turnout, education, substantially increases economic literacy. The other two—age and income—have little effect on economic beliefs.  Though it sounds naive to count on the affluent to look out for the interests of the needy, that is roughly what the data advise. All kinds of voters hope to make society better off, but the well educated are more likely to get the job done. Selective turnout widens the gap between what the public gets and what it wants. But it narrows the gap between what the public gets and what it needs.  [...]  A moderate reform suggested by my analysis is to reduce or eliminate efforts to increase voter turnout. Education and age are the two best predictors of turnout. Since the former is the strongest predictor of economic literacy, and the latter has little connection with it, the median voter’s economic literacy exceeds the median citizen’s. If “get out the vote” campaigns led to 100% participation, politicians would have to compete for the affection of noticeably more biased voters than they do today.   Here are the studies he references to back up his first two points, that wider political participation means different policy preferences, and that education and not income, is driving these results:  Mueller and Stratmann (2003)   Mueller and Stratmann (2003) hypothesize that more political participation (implying that poorer voters take a more active interest in politics), leads to more redistribution and to a larger public sector. Their results, based on pooled cross-national, time series evidence, show that in countries with well-entrenched democratic institutions, this is indeed the case. However, in weak democracies, greater participation does not lead to bigger government, implying that politically privileged groups can block redistributive policies.    Caplan (2002b: 429).   Caplan 2002b (429) tests this hypothesis. As long as we include my standard list of control variables, the economic beliefs of registered voters are statistically indistinguishable from those of nonvoters. Admittedly, more educated people (a) think more like economists and, (b) are more likely to vote. This is probably an important reason why democracy works as well as it does (Caplan 2007a, 156–58). But after we control for education and other confounding factors, voters are as biased as non-voters.   Followup question: Does voter bias affect the use of money in politics, and how?"

I will try to respond to your follow-up theoretically.  If money interests align with biases (even if the rationale differs--for example, an anti-market bias aligns with protectionist policies), then money will tolerate and support the biases. If they do not align (for example, between pro-market and anti-market biases), money interests can 1) use propaganda to alter those biases and/or 2) allow the biases to persist, but use their money power to alter policy more directly (versus who gets elected).

AskSocialScience,2zkf9i,diporasidi,10,Thu Mar 19 08:47:50 2015 UTC,"Your lecturer was pretty accurate. I think the important distinction between the two concepts is that the mandate tends to be justification after the fact, rather than before it.   Ex. New emperor ascends the throne: He must have the mandate of heaven. Famine under the new emperor: He must no longer have the mandate of heaven, and is vulnerable to a new candidate who does. While this doesn't explicitly encourage rebellion, it does make it much easier for an usurper to gain legitimacy.    This is as opposed to the divine right of kings, where the justification for their actions is innate as representatives of God on Earth. In theory, any ill action taken by a divine right monarch was either sabotaged by outside forces or their subject simply don't understand the long-term benefits of the policy.  Heaven in China is a somewhat abstract concept, perhaps better conceived of as an enforcement of natural order rather than sentient gods. Religion is a bit of a tricky subject here, because it tends to force things like Confucianism and ancestor worship into a western framework in many minds. The Chinese emperor was not really a religious authority in that they would guide religious practice, but the government of China was considered sacred in itself as a representation of cosmic order, while the past emperors would be first among the revered ancestors.   I can't speak for Korea, but Japan's emperor is more similar to a divine right than the mandate, but distinct from both, as the emperor is seen as an actual divine presence on earth.  I got most of this from the early chapters of A Search for Modern China, by Jonathan D. Spence and ""From Yao to Mao:5000 years of Chinese History,"" a lecture by Kenneth Hammond."

AskSocialScience,2zkty6,matildemp,5,Thu Mar 19 12:30:44 2015 UTC,"Democracy is a form of government under which people govern themselves, typically via voting directly on what the government ought to do (in direct democracy) or voting for representatives who decide what the government ought to do (in representative democracy). Democracy is such a wide-ranging concept that there's not really just one accepted definition or source to look to, but Robert Dahl's On Democracy is one of many classic books on the topic, so maybe start there if you want a bit more information.  There are all sorts of variations and ""democracy"" is not a simple term that can just completely describe a state. For instance, the United States is a democratic republic, because it is an association of states united under a federal government, and all the states and the federal government itself are run democratically.   The rule of law is a technical term that describes a situation under which a state is run according to clearly defined and fairly-applied laws, as opposed to a state that is run by a capricious dictator or by selective application of laws or a state where the laws change every day or other things like this.  Frank Lovett's ""A Positivist Account of the Rule of Law"" contains extensive citations (in the first footnotes) to various explanations of the rule of law and the article itself tries to give a more systemic and clear definition of what the rule of law is.  A democracy could or could not feature the rule of law - if people are voting each day to throw various unpopular people in jail, the police are ineffective, and so on, there is no rule of law.

AskSocialScience,2zijmd,Bulwarky,8,Wed Mar 18 21:32:07 2015 UTC,"The video isn't awful but it's a bit glib and confusing. I'd say in general the description of Weber's argument is too short, which creates some potential misinterpretations.   1.) The 'Turnip Field' example is confusing in that Weber's discussions of agricultural labor actually illustrate the opposite thing: it was difficult to make migrant workers into full-time proletarians because rural workers would simply make some money in the city and then go back to the farm. They preferred to maintain their current standard of living and have more free time, instead of advancing themselves. This is the opposite of the Protestant Ethic: Weber introduces that example as a contrasting case.    2.) The claim that workers are 'stripped of their very  humanity' is hyperbolic and really doesn't have any basis in what Weber wrote. He was pessimistic, but he was also very leery of drawing moral conclusions, partially because he thought capitalism determined large parts of our morality and vice versa.   3.) The meaning of the Iron Cage metaphor is contentious, but it's usually not understood to mean that workers in particular are trapped in their social position. It's meant to a refer to a broader argument that modernity is an inescapable and ubiquitous fact. It imposes harsh limits, but it's not a form of political repression.   4.) The claim about a 'workforce founded in religious principles' is likewise a misrepresentation. Weber isn't talking about a polity that would have principles, he's talking about a society that does certain empirical things. (There's a later argument about 'civil religion' that does claim something like the former.) The point is that we live in a secular society that no longer experiences religious upheavals, but that has a religious prehistory.   5.) More importantly, the next part mangles both the definition of the Protestant Ethic and the theology of Calvinism. The whole point of Calvinism and predestination is that you cannot achieve salvation through good works (in fact, you can't be saved in your earthly lifetime, which is what distinguishes it from, say, Baptism) : the elect and the damned are distinguished from each other before birth by God. You can only show that you might be one of the elect. You're trapped in competition in social life because there's no hope of divine intercession. The video doesn't make this clear. Moreover, Capitalism is not a direct expression of Calvinist religiosity. There is a very important part of Weber's argument towards the end of the book where he states that the original religious animus behind Calvinism has been lost: while Calvinism might have created the conditions for the accumulation of profit, people are no longer motivated by religious concerns in the same way as are Reformation-era Calvinists. But the inevitability and fixity of the iron cage we live in is a secularization of that very earlier idea of predestination which is now dead. We maintain the same obsession with appearances but we no longer know why. This is the reason we don't know why we're anxious."
AskSocialScience,2zijmd,redwhiskeredbubul,9,Thu Mar 19 00:18:10 2015 UTC,"I was expecting to like this, but I think it's almost completely a misrepresentation of what's worthwhile about the Protestant Ethic.  The makers of this seems to have taken the a priori stance ""capitalism is bad for the worker"", and then tried to use dear Weber to support that position.    It has been five year since I read it last, but some of the huge overstatements that should be noted:   It mentions ""American-style capitalism"".  While Weber does quote from Ben Franklin and some other Americans early in the work, I feel that they drop out of the narrative and he's primarily talking about Europe. ""working for a boss"".  I think this is a weird Marxist reading of Weber because I don't hardly remember Weber discussing workers at all.  The Protestant Ethic is about the bosses' motivations, first and foremost, not the workers'.  The little mouse-boss says, ""Work hard or go to hell.""  In Weber, we have Calvinists going, ""Fuck, there are the damned and the elected, and G-d has predestined this stuff before I was born, but I want to be one of the elected, but nothing I can do in this world can change that.  How do I know, then, if I'm elected or damned?  Oh, I can look at this world and see how I'm doing, if I'm living a righteous life with righteous worldly rewards.""  The Calvinists wanted worldly rewards not for worldly pleasure and power (as Weber argues, say, the Medicis might have), but as a sign of other worldly rewards.  This led to the Calvinists living ascetic lives (Weber later went on to do a lot of work on asceticism), and so their worldly rewards get reinvested rather than spent on pleasure, etc.  This is what makes capitalism--the making money is an end onto itself; money is not instrumentally accumulated for the pleasure it can provide.  This is the crux of Weber's capitalist story, one about capitalists, not a Marxist explanation of exploitation of the workers under capitalist society.  This is the essential problem with the piece--they're, as it were, reading Weber instrumentally to make essentially Marxist arguments which greatly contorts dear Weber to the point of being almost unrecognizable.   I don't understand how they relate the Calvinist anxiety over predestined salvation with our own ""waking up each morning to make the morning commute"".   Most important, they (like really all Marxists who try to use Weber) totally miss out on the mechanism here.  Especially in their little animations here, they make it seem like ""the bosses"" are using G-d to exploit the workers to this day (hence the little bubbles like, ""Work hard or you won't get to heaven,"" which isn't even something a Calvinist would say), but I believe Weber argues that this ""Spirit of capitalism"", though invented with the Calvinists, was secularized and then spread to others, meaning that by the time he's writing you could have Lutheran, Catholic, or atheist capitalists, as the ""spirit"" generalized (this is the part I remember the least).   The things ends with all these ""American"" things, how we work hard, blah blah.  But if we still think that the Calvinist influence is the defining feature of modern capitalism (Weber, I believe, saw it more as the spark that started a chain of actions rather than an influence that continues directly to the present) what we'd expect is that other countries where Calvinism ruled (Scotland, the Netherlands, etc.) would display these same characters they point out in American society.  I'm not sure they do, but I think goes to show how this video was made not to explore Weber's thought, but rather condemn American capitalism. The ""Iron Cage"" is the condition of modern society, not capitalist society.  Which isn't to say it doesn't come from capitalism, but rather than capitalism is one influence among many--there's also rationalization, bureaucratization, secularization, etc.   I don't have that section in front of me, but when it's used today it's much more about bureaucratization than it is about capitalism writ large (see, for example, Powell and DiMaggio's ""The Iron Cage Revisited"")."

I think that it's true in both cases that higher participation leads to a better outcome -- admittedly only after a certain point in the case of mass suicide; but in the case of email adoption, if we consider the effect on the individual actor (which has no intrinsic bearing on our dependent variable in the case of suicide -- only the extrinsic benefit of not suffering the deaths of loved ones and friends exists), we'd find that he's wasting his time bothering with email before a certain level of adoption is reached.

Basically, it comes out of a tradition in psychology that starts in Freud, runs through Melanie Klein, and ends up as something called Attachment Theory, which does have experimental corroboration and is the basis of psychodynamic psychotherapy.    The thing about TA is that it's really, really, schematic and the concepts (e.g. 'life script') are just extrapolated to fit the theory. Berne basically takes the kinds of healthy/neurotic patterns of interaction that can be described through attachment styles and works them out in abstract permutations. He also reduces those patterns of interaction to linguistic styles of communication, which has the advantage of making them concrete but which also sort of trivializes the underlying psychic processes and emotions involved. (This is especially a problem in how he handles personality disorders.) Doubtless the 'games' that Berne describes are, in fact, things that people do. That doesn't imply that everything that is done is a game in Berne's sense or that the game is anything more than a surface manifestation of a deeper problem. In other words, it's not comprehensive. For example, imagine somebody has bipolar disorder, which is an organic condition, and trying to explain their behavior through TA.   In short, if you take it with a grain of salt, you might find something useful in it, but don't expect it to necessarily explain everything and be cautious if it does."

AskSocialScience,2zfclh,WasteofInk,21,Wed Mar 18 02:36:13 2015 UTC,"Mary Waters has written about how ethnicity works in America, especially her book Ethnic Options.  With the census data, she could link up people's ethnicity with their parents ethnicity. If the parents had different ethnicities, adult children reported their ethnicity in predictable ways.  For example, in the 1990, which was still during the Cold War, people with one Russian were much much less likely than random to say they were Russian.  One of the coolest parts of her book is the tables looking at these probabilities.  To get at the mechanisms behind this, Waters conducted a series of in qualitative in-depth interviews, she found that, even in people who had two or more different ancestries, adults tend to have one narrative of what they ""are"".  Someone might say ""I'm Italian"", and leave it at that, but in the course of the interview it comes out they're Italian on their father's side, and Irish on their mother's side, and oh yeah, their dad is actually just half Italian because his paternal grandmother was born in France, and ""Oh, I guess I never thought of it like I'm Irish, and Italian, and French, I always just thought I was Italian.""  If I remember Water's argument correctly, English is one of the ancestry groups less likely to be identified when they question is simply, ""What's your ethnicity?""  So the way the census asks the questions probably undercounts the proportion of people with English ancestors.  Second, is just generally the way institutions work.  Most America's institutions were set up in English.  Public schools eventually made sure that all children learned English.  Work on the post-1965 wave of immigrants , for example, found that basically everyone in the second generation (the generation born in America) learns English.  In fact, Van Tran's ""English Gain vs. Spanish Loss? Language Assimilation among Second-Generation Latinos in Young Adulthood"" that, among Hispanic immigrants, the question isn't really even if the second generation are going to learn English--they are--but whether they are going to ""keep"" the Spanish that their parents speak (it's no coincidence that Van Tran was one of Mary Waters's students).  Obviously, immigrants learned English before mandatory public schooling, but public school has a lot to do with it (here's a look at German in isolated rural Wisconsin in an earlier time).  German was particularly stigmatized in WWI and again in WWII, which led to many German-speaking institutions being shut down.  In at least one Midwestern state, the government made German medium schools illegal (I think it was Wisconsin, but I can't find the exact law now).  Lastly, Germans are unevenly distributed across the U.S.  While they have a heavy presence in the Midwest, they are much more lightly represented in places like the South.  People of British and Irish heritage, on the other hand, are heavily represented all over the country."

Prejudices about skin tone existed for centuries in Europe, where they were a class marker (fair skin meant you didn't need to perform heavy labor). They also exist in Japan. If skin whitening products are big specifically in Malaysia or Indonesia you might want to look at what countries there is a big popular culture influence from, especially if it's been revived or if it is a recent thing. Judging from the huge quantity of pop internet articles about the topic I also found and the relatively smaller quantity of academic research on the topic, it sounds to me (and I'm speculating here) like this may be somewhat recent and have to do with a sense of regional identity, e.g. Malaysians and Indonesians as 'asians' comparing themselves to Japanese people or Indians, who may be imagined as 'naturally' fairer-skinned.

I worked specifically with hill tribes in S.E. Asia on Aids prevention. The dark/light skin is a comparative element between S.E. asians not an actual white vs. black argument. The idea of skin color being connected to your social status in Asia is well documented. It also happened in Europe. I'll address that later.  Rowman & Littlefield talk about this at length in Is Lighter Better?: Skin-tone Discrimination Among Asian Americans (2007) I just recently read this. It is a good and detailed look into this queation.  Historically this is all true. In East and S.E. Asia a person's skin color has been the indicator of their own social and economic status. Farmers who made a living by working in the fields out in the sun were easily distinguishable from their upper class piers by their skin tone. Laboring in the sun all day gives you a much darker complexion.  The upper class were able to stay indoors in the shade out of the heat of the day and avoid taning and sun damage.   The same skin-whitening phenomenon occurred in Europe during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.  Aristocracy used make up and even lead oxide inorder to have a very pale complexion.  Now, currently there are more factors to this. Westernization, ads in magazines, and television, the idea of Western peoples being wealthy and ""in general"" being caucasion has added to the preexisting idea. This compounds the fact. This is why all over East and Southeast Asia you can find wide brimmed hats, long sleeves for fore arms and even full face/body swimwear to prevent tanning. You can also find LOTS of whiteing creams, bleaching powders, and such to help bring the down the skin tone.  That said, I must still say, that this is glossing over other current factors which are various and have different reasons for different groups especially when we are talking about ~1/3 of the entire population of the Earth.

AskSocialScience,2zdwl0,Prasiatko,15,Tue Mar 17 19:47:14 2015 UTC,"So as a case study you might look at the ""taper tantrum"" in summer 2013 when the Fed hinted it might begin tightening, prompting capital flight from emerging markets and causing their currencies to depreciate substantially (especially the ""fragile five"", Brazil, India, Indonesia, Turkey, and South Africa).  There's a great IMF Staff paper on that here: ""EMERGING MARKET VOLATILITY: LESSONS FROM THE TAPER TANTRUM"" http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2014/sdn1409.pdf  Basically the story you tell of a weak currency being good, because it helps exports, is one that applies most strongly to export-oriented countries (like China) or developed countries (Europe, US, etc.).  What about developing countries, which don't export heavily? Say, India? Cheaper imports can actually matter a lot. You say it doesn't seem useful, but think about this: oil and commodities are priced in dollars. If your currency is strong, you can import oil cheaper and boost domestic industry.  Stronger currency also means lower inflation. Why? Because some % of a basket of goods for CPI is going to be imports.  Cheaper imports means the basket is priced lower. So lower inflation, which matters a lot for some countries. Like India.  Source: http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/1605/economics/higher-inflation-and-exchange-rates/  Lastly, stronger currency means you can repay foreign debts better. Imagine you borrow on international markets to fund a project (either private investment, or a public works, doesn't matter). That's probably going to be borrowing in dollars. When you are earning money off the project to repay your debt, the exchange rate matters: if it depreciates, you will have to pay more in terms of local currency than you had expected. If it appreciates, you pay less. This is why extreme depreciation can cause debt crises, as in the Mexican peso crisis or the Thai situation in the Asian Financial Crisis in the 1990s.  Mexican peso crisis: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_peso_crisis Thai crisis: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_financial_crisis#Thailand  So, it depends a lot on your countries external position, what you import vs export, etc. All depreciation is not good. So off the top of my head, 3 benefits to a strong currency: boost domestic (non-exporting) industry via lower cost of imports,  lower inflation, and easier to repay external debts. There may be others."

In short, there's not really any consensus as to why people are leaving organized religions. It's important to make the distinction that people aren't becoming atheists, they're simply not a part of organized religious groups (roughly 17% of people consider themselves religious ""nones"" but only about 2% say they are atheists).   For some, generational replacement helps answer this question while also giving some credibility to secularization hypotheses that have fallen into disfavor since the US has stubbornly remained religious even in the face of modernity. However, you're right in that something happened in the 90s that caused a drastic increase in the number of those who no longer claim a religious preference, so what might that be? Work by Hout and Fischer (2002) suggests that the rise of the Religious Right tied strict religious morals to republicanism and, as a result, younger people who disagree with Republicans also see their views as inconsistent with major Christian organizations. Putnam and Campbell's (2012) book about this topic also highly suggests that this is the case.   Overall, the rise of the religious ""nones"" is interesting because, on the surface, it seems like the country is becoming more secular, but I think it's too early to say that. Even so, the possible implications for secularization theories as well as the religious economies approach (which states that the US is more religious because religious organizations compete for followers) are significant.

Also, there's the issue of ""cultural"" association with a religion, where, for example, in a study by Levada Center* one third of Russians who claimed to be orthodox (overall, around 60% of the population) at the same time did not believe in god: while being functionally atheists, they were tied to the religion culturally and labeled themselves as ""orthodox christians"".  So what people consider themselves to be and what they actually are don't have to match. Therefore, to tell how many atheists there are one should rely on other means, not self-identification.  * — I cannot find the original 1/3 out of 60% study at the moment (it's an older one), but here's a link to a 2012 study, where they say out of 87% who associate themselves with orthodox christianity roughly half do not believe in god; instead ""being an orthodox Russian"" is understood in terms of a socially approved label, like ""a Soviet man"" was in the USSR."

If it were driving the trend, you'd expect to see a curve instead of a rising trend line, wouldn't you?

Nobody got left behind. So to speak. But that's simply a guess.  But prior to that, the trend line had been flat since the seventies. That's when I became a ""none"" myself; and I am fairly sure that I first heard the phrase around then. There were any number of alternative opportunistic spiritual movements springing up at the time - the New Age movement, the NeoPagan movement, Moonies, the Rajnishis, EST - let's throw Campus Crusade for Christ in there.   So there were a lot of ways to explore spirituality, and if you were socially minded - alternate religious movements too. But affiliation with and participation in the traditional mainline churches dropped during that time, I believe. Another indicator might be the graduation rates of pastors and priests in the mainline traditions.   And I THINK the mid to late seventies when the whole Evangelical movement really took hold. But outright atheism is such a taboo it remains more acceptable to claim any faith, even Satanism, over a direct non-belief. Certainly that was my strategy and my reasons were utterly pragmatic - questioning faith would be seen as moderately rebellious. Rejecting faith as irrational would have been personally threatening to the worldviews of both parents.  One generation on, as people sort themselves together, the issue is at one remove, then two.

Can you troubleshoot these devices on your own?  ...can you explain naturalism?

However, never mind the advantages or lacks - I also wonder about the social and physical risks. Not all that long ago, that could have been painfully literal - and here's another follow-up question.

AskSocialScience,2z9ftj,AdamKeiper,3,Mon Mar 16 22:52:17 2015 UTC,"There are several theories as to what occurs with changes in religious affiliation. Secularization theory is a very large and complex body of work that has been unable to account for empirical findings for quite some time. For instance, the young Peter Berger hypothesised that increased religious pluralism would lead to the abandonment of religion because pluralism relativises truth - i.e., the explanations offered by any one religious community are challenged by those offered by others. This makes religion altogether implausible, argues Berger, and secularisation in the form of decline of religious belief and activity will follow.  This has been challenged by many, but IMO most interestingly by Kaufman et.al. who point out that the main source of pluralisation in Europe today (Europe being the bastion of secularism) is immigration. Immigrants tend to have strong religious commitments, traditionalist values which facilitate a high degree of cultural reproduction (socialisation of children into said tradition) and - most importantly - have a fertility rate that far supercedes that of secular heritage Europeans. Thus secularisation in Europe, understood as the overall decline in religious belief, is likely to become reversed in the near future due to the demographic developments following increased immigration from non-Western countries.  As chicagofirefifa points out, the changes reported among heritage westerners can also be explained by a weakening of the social bonds that used to tie an individual or family to one particular church. Individualisation leads for many to increased selectivity, also in the religious marketplace.   As a methodological sidenote, the question used by the GSS strikes me as odd. (""What is your religious preference? Is it Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, some other religion, or no religion?""). It can easily be misunderstood by respondents because the option 'no religion' can have two meanings: 1) irreligion, having no religion or 2) having no preference for one religion in particular, but perhaps feeling attracted to one or more religions. The second option would reflect a universalised attitude towards religious truth and belonging."

AskSocialScience,2zams6,FockSmulder,2,Tue Mar 17 00:16:33 2015 UTC,"Great question! Correct me if I’m wrong, but I feel like this is the crux of your inquiry:   I’m hoping to find out which countries are most and least consistent in the amount that they value lives lost by different means.   So let’s look at the data between two culturally similar countries: The United States and the United Kingdom. The United States allots about 8,500 dollars per person per year on total healthcare costs 1. For anti-terrorism, the government appropriated 16 billion dollars per year 2, or about 48 dollars per person per year. The UK allots 80 billion pounds for its National Health Services at an average of 1,250 pounds per person per year 3. On terrorism, it spends 3.5 billion pounds for 55 pounds per person 4. The current exchange rate is about 1.5 dollars per pound, so that means its 83 US dollars for terrorism and 1,875 US dollars for healthcare.   That’s probably a different result than what you were expecting. Shoot, it was different than what I was expecting. I, like many other people, have been bombarded by articles like this one, claiming that we are spending disproportionally large sums of money on terrorism compared to “actual” threats like heart disease and cancer. To be sure, these are serious issues facing the world right now and so I’m not going to trivialize them. What I am going to say, however, is that many of the ways that we calculate these sorts of things may not be the most unbiased.   Let’s use that link I used earlier as an example. For one, it conflates anti-terrorism spending with total defense spending. In reality, anti-terrorism is one of a number of pursuits that fall under the purview of “national security.” Second, it only considers the direct fatalities caused by terrorism and sticks in it the divisor (x trillion dollars/3,000 or so lives). That’s not accurate either because it’s trying to make a comparison between discrete events and relatively continuous ones. That makes a huge difference. We mourn for the dead but spend for the living.  People are dying all of the time of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. We aren’t spending the money on the people who died but on those that are currently alive and at risk. Similarly, we aren’t spending on those that have perished in attacks but for those that are at risk. The objective risk of dying in an attack is definitely lower than dying of a heart attack—there’s no question about that. However, we are also determining the risk based upon statistics that are affected by prevention methods. We don’t know what the baseline rate of heart disease or terrorism is without government intervention so we’re left with the fact that our guesses already contain a lot of bias in them.   Even if the numbers bore out the relationship that I feel most people were expecting, a discrepancy between the statistical value of a life already varies between countries as determined by the citizens of the countries themselves. Additionally, the values made by different organizations within the same country are going to vary too based upon different methods and means of estimation 5.    I think we also expect governments, especially democratic governments, to largely be monolithic in their spending priorities. We almost picture them like a giant person trying to plan their weekly budget. But, in reality, the creation of budgetary priorities is a complicated process that involves a number of competing factions at different positions of prominence. As a result of this inefficiency, a number of organizations that should receive more funding don’t and can invite a fallacy in comparing between agencies. For instance, we don’t say that, because a hypothetical city government spends 90 USD per person per year on health expenses that they value a human life 100 times less than the federal government does. They’re limited by the resources available to them.   I mentioned earlier that the objective risk between dying of a heart attack is certainly greater than a terrorist attack and that some organizations that should receive more funding don’t. So we do, probably, spend a disproportionate amount on terrorism than on an individual health issue—like heart attacks. A number of people have pointed to psychological explanations as to why and I recommend you read them. (Thinking, Fast and Slow is a great book to get a general view, but you can google it and get a pretty good picture). In this way, you can better understand why our more primal mind helps paint these threats as more pressing and terrifying than they objectively are. I’m not saying that this excuses governments in their financial prioritization—I definitely feel that many nations need to closely examine their military budgets and reexamine the balance between their emotional and rational mind. But we have to remember that governments are comprised of men and women. Men and women who maintain the status quo when they aren’t pressed by high valence issues (which spending priorities rarely are). Men and women who are just as fallible and prone to cognitive biases as we are. But, at the end of the day, the discrepancies between the priorities may not be as pronounced as we expect."
AskSocialScience,2zams6,awildpoliticalnerd,3,Tue Mar 17 20:37:13 2015 UTC,"I've read that governments that provide health care often set a monetary values on an arbitrary human life (or citizen's life) in order to maximize the amount of lives hospitals/doctors/the health care system can save based on the available financial resources.   There are two mechanisms that are used, neither are quite as utilitarian as simply placing a financial value on life but one of the methods does (sometimes) look like that;   Quality adjusted life year (used in UK, Belgium, France and Italy). This measures the average life extension of intervention weighted by quality of life, for instance two treatments which both added 6 months to life but one with higher quality of life for that period would have a higher score. One country (UK) place a financial value on each QALY of £20k-£30k and only for drugs, a drug which scores a 0.5 QALY but costs more then £15k would not be available for free (instead via the cost-sharing drug fund program). Generally this mechanism is simply used to understand the relative benefits of treatment options, countries tend to favor other mechanisms for managing costs outside of drugs (in extreme cases financial incentives for effective physician assisted suicide, in less extreme cases strong social focus on hospice and palliative care in general). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Simply this looks at the relative value of one treatment over another, as a very simplistic example (the formula is extremely complicated) a drug which had double the efficacy of the next best available drug would have a price ceiling of double the next best available drug.   Generally countries tend to use these as guides rather then fixed measures, only the UK (QALY) and Germany (ICER) use them in a relatively fixed manner.   The US is alone in that we don't actively restrict treatment, insurers use a mixture of both for analysis purposes (as part of larger clinical value models) which feed in to incentives offered (as well as provider contract decisions) but its illegal (for insurers) to restrict payments based on these models. Neither Medicare or Medicaid restrict either, there are two proposed Medicare demonstrations that would start in 2019 which would introduce ICER to providers but I doubt these will make it past ethics evaluations.   Governments also spend money to prevent terrorist attacks. Does this spending depend much on the same sort of cost/benefit analysis, or does the effect of contagion make it too difficult?   Defense spending seems mostly unrelated to simple cost/benefit, everyone who is not the US underspends and the US overspends; effectively the US subsidizes security for the rest of the world (recent US intervention not withstanding). Congress don't seem particularly responsive to the budgets military planners actually ask for as they keep giving the DoD more then they want."

Unexpectedly, this ostensibly positive development had serious repercussions on important segments of the country’s economy as the Dutch guilder became stronger, making Dutch non-oil exports more expensive and, therefore, less competitive. This syndrome has been witnessed in many countries across the world, including but not limited to resource-rich commodity exporters. Although Dutch disease is generally associated with a natural resource discovery, it can occur from any development that results in a large inflow of foreign currency, including a sharp surge in natural resource prices, foreign assistance, and foreign direct investment. Economists have used the Dutch disease model to examine such episodes as the flow of American treasures into 16th century Spain and gold discoveries in Australia in the 1850s.""  http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/basics/dutch.htm  When a countries currency becomes stronger exports decrease because they are more expensive for others to buy.  And of course the reverse happens when the currency becomes weaker.  This paper looks at it in modern US, and argues it does not really exist:  ""because many manufacturers in resource-abundant counties supply inputs to the oil and gas sector, while many others sell locally-traded goods and benefit from increases in local demand. Manufacturers' revenue productivity also grows during booms, especially in linked and local industries, but there is no evidence that output prices rise. The results demonstrate how a meaningful share of manufacturers produce locally traded goods, and they highlight how linkages to natural resources can be a driver of manufacturing growth.""  http://www.nber.org/papers/w20508  And this article talks about Norway bypassing the 'curse' here (under the title 'Dutch Disease'):  When the first oil began to flow, Kasim remembers, the Norwegians' reaction was the same as that of any country that suddenly strikes black gold. People viewed the sudden windfall of oil revenues as an unqualified blessing. The money poured straight into the government budget, and public spending rose. But by 1972, it was clear the economy was in deep trouble.  ""Norway had four years of Dutch disease, where wages went up, factories lost their top people to the oil industry, and foreigners coming in to invest in the oil boom drove up the value of the currency so high that customers in other countries could no longer afford Norway's other export products,"" he says. ""Initially, the government reacted by handing out subsidies and we went deeper into the mire.""  By 1976, Kasim says, the damage had put the fear of being hit by a tsunami of oil money deep into Norwegian hearts. The country decided to do what Iraq and many other oil-producing states never do: deliberately limit how much oil revenue enters the economy.  Initially, the government decided to take all the profits generated by its state-owned oil companies and reinvest them in searching for and producing more oil.  But by 1995, the flood of income had grown beyond what this could absorb. So, Norway created a special buffer fund to keep the oil profits out of the economy by declaring them the property of future generations of Norwegians. The government forbid itself from using more than 4 percent of the money for current infrastructure and other public projects and invested the rest in financial markets abroad, effectively sending it into exile.  http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Norways-Energy-Policies-A-Lesson-For-The-World.html"

So in areas like services, such as haircuts or whatever, anything that can't be traded, the prices will go up. In these sectors wages will go up as a result and manufacturing will decline.   I'm not sure how this might change in the future with robots, but for now and the past the high income due to natural resource wealth makes wages too high to compete with tradeable goods on the global market.  For a source you can look in any intro economics textbook. I think I originally learned it from ""Introduction to International Political Economy"" by David Balaam."

Most people entering that program have little or no background in statistics (we had people with undergraduate degrees in poetry and English), and many in both my cohort and the cohort I taught were averse to quantitative analysis and experienced math anxiety. By and large they did fine, though they were willing to sit down and try to engage with the material. If you come in with an attitude that you will be unable to do statistics--which, at this level, is likely to not even require high school level math--and are unwilling to work at it, you are likely to have issues. That applies generally to any topic in graduate school however; it is primarily about effort rather than raw ability, though the latter can make the process faster and smoother. My experience is that it is common for programs to encourage students to work together in statistics classes, and this is a very effective way to navigate material. Study groups, and later working groups if you plan to do research, should probably be a core part of your overall academic strategy; strong quantitative people are likely to refine their knowledge by tutoring others, so it is a mutually beneficial exchange."

That's not really the case.  Most people understand inflation to be as it is defined: an increase in the general price level of goods and services.  Now, higher prices might mean your money buys less, but OP is right in considering that inflation/deflation are functions of the price of GOODS AND SERVICES, not of money.  Money has a price, sure, but only relative to holders of one currency looking to buy another.1  It's also helpful to think of the amount of one good or service that money can buy as sort of a ""price"" of money relative to another, but that's purchasing power parity2 and it's also a function of cross-currency trading.  Very little of that has to do with inflation.  Maybe interest rates, but not inflation.  What OP is really interested in is Moore's Law, the phenomenon by which greater efficiency in computing and power distribution makes electronics cheaper to build."
AskSocialScience,2z4y2y,iamelben,2,Mon Mar 16 14:57:19 2015 UTC,"""Inflation is a change in the price of money"" is the easiest-to-understand shorthand I know to explain how the (extremely complex) mechanism works. It should be clear that it's an oversimplification of reality, and I'm sure everyone understands that - especially because people who aren't involved in currency exchange processes never buy money, and to them, money doesn't really have a ""price"". Again, an elegant oversimplification to explain, in a few words, a process more complex than any of us will ever know. No need for RANDOM CAPS or any of that.   What OP is really interested in is Moore's Law, the phenomenon by which greater efficiency in computing and power distribution makes electronics cheaper to build.   That's an extremely small piece of the puzzle. Moore's Law is about how many transistors you can fit on a microchip (not about ""computing power"" or some such thing). This has a minuscule effect on the prices of most electronics - the initially high prices of electronics have a lot to do with recouping research and development costs (to which Moore's Law is irrelevant, as the cost of figuring out how to fit more transistors on a microchip does not go to the makers of TVs or BluRay players) and with consumer electronics being marketed as status symbols. Very few companies bear the costs of figuring out how to fit more transistors on a microchip, so I find Moore's Law to be an entirely inadequate answer to the question."

So if we get $1000 for 3 washing machines today but next week those same three washing machines get us $1050 then the ""price"" of money is going down.

Here's a review article that found that 'attendance at school is both a dependent and independent variable in relation to intelligence.' In general there are substantial environmental contributing factors to intelligence as measured by IQ tests, along with a larger portion that appears to be innate. One thing to keep in mind is that IQ testing is designed to measure the innate part and that the cultural and social effects on intelligence are difficult to quantify: they tend to be discussed qualitatively. Keep in mind also that what IQ tests measure ('g quotient') is a statistical construct based on aggregating lots of more qualitatively understood types of intelligence, and that we know very little about biological mechanisms in intelligence. It's a very 'constructed' category. While most people don't think, at this point, that it is just a statistical artifact, the question of what IQ 'really means' is pretty sprawling."

AskSocialScience,2z0j83,meltingacid,7,Sat Mar 14 12:48:05 2015 UTC,"It happens all the time.  The long story: In the 1970s, oil prices shot up. The elites of the oil countries (like the Saudi royal family) were getting rich by selling oil to the west (especially the US); they spent some of the money at home, spent some of it on Cartier watches and prostitutes, but there was still a lot left over. They deposited the extra dollars (""petrodollars"") at banks they trusted, which were in the west.   When a bank takes in money, it looks for places to lend it out again. Banks were taking in so much money that they threw caution out the window and frantically made lots of loans to Third World nations. The interest was high, but not so high once you considered that inflation (for dollars at least) was high back then as well.   Then, in the early 1980s, inflation came down and the flow of petrodollars dried up. Third World countries that had borrowed plentiful, inflating dollars freely in the easy-money 1970s now had to pay back at high interest in scarce, valuable dollars.   And many of the things they had borrowed for were not paying propositions. This was sometimes their fault (although even then the banks were also at fault for not doing their homework), and sometimes it was the banks' fault (for lending to vicious dictators, knowing full well that the money was going to be used to maintain these dictators in power).  But rather than let the banks get in trouble for making stupid and evil loans, the world decided that this was a ""Third World debt crisis"" because those silly natives couldn't handle money.  Several institutions (most notably the IMF, but also the World Bank, the US Treasury, and even aid organizations) would come to ""help"" with this crisis, which meant giving these countries new loans to pay back the old loans (that is, bailing out the Western banks) while attaching conditions to the new loans.  The idea that you have to change your ways before getting rescued isn't wrong in itself, but these institutions were full of people who had learned an extreme version of free-market economics (basically, you know the idiots on Reddit who can only say ""government bad""? That attitude ruled these institutions). So the ""reforms"" they demanded meant enacting the free-market agenda: Cut taxes, cut government programs (except the military, we like to sell weapons), privatize things like water supplies (ie, sell them to Western corporations) and so on. Essentially, get rid of your government. (This was called the Washington Consensus because many of the institutions pushing it were based in Washington).  Thing is, that sort of economics really only works in textbooks. These conditions would cause new economic crises, which would need new rescues, with new conditions, causing new crises, and so on.  And the IMF and the other institutions, although they were as ideological as Lenin, weren't stupid--they knew people didn't like their program and would vote it away the first chance they got. Thus, the programs came to include ""protected democracy,"" where the economic program was protected from democracy.   So, democracy undermined by economics.  Today, the IMF has more or less figured out that this didn't work, and certainly the countries it used to bully don't put up with it like they used to, but the Euro area, which was set up at the height of the free-market ideology and basically has it built into its DNA, hasn't learned it.  Some more specific examples:  --After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russians tried straight-up Washington Consensus programs. The big difference was that, instead of selling their state-run enterprises to foreign corporations, they sold them to connected locals (and sometimes to the Western economists who were advising them). The result was a truly horrifying economic collapse and the emergence of an oligarchy. When the Russian parliament looked like it was going to try to undo these ""reforms,"" Yeltsin (Putin's predecessor) attacked them (the ""1993 constitutional crisis""). This played in the West as ""brave Yeltsin prevents communist coup."" So, economics undermining democracy.  --Right after the invasion of Iraq, the US military, not knowing any better, started setting up some genuine democratic institutions. The American administration put the kibosh on these and instead sent Paul Bremer with his ""100 orders."" These make interesting reading; they're entirely about imposing free-market ideology (everything from low tax rates for corporations to allowing Monsanto's patented seeds). The Economist, which at the time was fully on board with the ideology, said ""the measures will represent the kind of wish-list that foreign investors and donor agencies dream of for developing markets."". Foreign investors and donor agencies, not the Iraqis. It wasn't for them to decide.  I could go on but I'll stop. Good readable sources here are Naomi Klein's The Shock Doctrine (from the con perspective) and Daniel Yergin's The Commanding Heights (written before the failure of these policies was clear and firmly in the ""yes, the transition will be painful but of course everyone knows it's for the best in the long run"" camp).

A market system can achieve this outcome, by the 2nd Welfare theorem, which says any efficient outcome can be supported by an equilibrium given certain prices and reallocation of initial endowments. So, in theory if the Gov't collected all the wealth in the US and distributed it evenly then let the market work we'd get a 'equitable' allocation.

In other words, and as another commentor have pointed out, you seem to have an overly narrow view of what historical explanation can be.

AskSocialScience,2yos0r,diporasidi,21,Wed Mar 11 15:51:10 2015 UTC,"So what's your understanding of church/sect?  Churches strive to cover everyone, usually in good standing with the state.  Sects cover some people and think the rest of the wicked world is damned, more or less.  Weber's original idea was that people are born into churches, but can only enter sects by decision (at least in his ideal typology).  This, though, assumes certain relationships between the Church and the State.  A denomination, on the other hand, is sort of in the middle.  A denomination has clear boundaries, doesn't try to cover everyone, but doesn't also think that everyone outside of the denomination is wrong, just different.  Most Protestant groups accept other Protestant groups as legitimate religious organizations, separate but also ""the same"" (a Lutheran baptistized by a Methodist doesn't need to be baptized; a Lutheran who is traveling could even go to a Methodist church).  Many of these groups started off as sects, but (for lack of a better term) ""mellowed out"".  The book Protestant, Catholic, Jew (from 1950) makes the rather convincing argument that, essentially, Jews and Catholics are treated like denominations in America by most people.  They're ""fine"".    This goes to show that context is important for these things.  I am not quite sure how the typology is meant to deal with minority groups like the Syriac Orthodox Church, but I believe the traditional analysis would be that they function as a sect in the Middle East, but they function like a denomination (for the most part) in America.  Globalization has obviously made these sorts of analyses more complicated, but even before that, I'm not sure they really worked perfectly with things like minority religions in the Muslim world, or really anything that was going on in East Asia.  Obviously, all these typologies make the most sense within Christianity, particularly Protestant Christianity, particularly I'd say Protestant Christianity in the English-speaking world (where we adopted a denominational system independent of the state, for the most part).  We can extend this to other places, but it doesn't work perfectly.  Ahmadiyya, to a certain degree, basically wants to be a denomination, but the ""Church(es)"" of traditional Islam refuse to recognize it as such.  To them, it is a cult (a cult being used here only to indicate that there's intense opprobrium).  Schools of thoughts, and movements, tend not to have clear boundaries of membership.  So Salafism for some people is a school of thought, like Pietism within the Lutheran context.  However, for others, it is a clearly bounded group of people and behaves more like a sect... and in some places, this sect tries to become the church (see ISIS, for example).  In other places, it can surely behave more like a denomination in practice even if it's a sect in theory (again, remember that Methodist and Baptists started off as ""sects"" before ending up denominations).  Cult is not a word that's really used in contemporary sociology of religion.  New Religious Movement is the term social scientists ended up using to get around.  Conventionally, for reasons not worth getting into, Sikhism is considered the last new ""World religion"", and so everything that comes after that, and isn't accepted as a denomination or part of an existing ""World religion"", is usually classed as a ""New Religious Movement"".  There are exceptions, of course, even within people who use this language (Baha'i is sometimes considered a World Religion, for example), but in general, people within the study of religion have moved away from all of these grand classification systems.  They were found to be not that useful--you've classified things, now what?  They're still trotted out sometimes, but for the most part, this sort of research isn't popular anymore (at least in the U.S., it's a little more common in Europe).  Research in the U.S. has found that denominations within Protestantism matter less than used to: most current research focuses broad type of Protestant orientations, the usual three being ""Mainline"", ""Evangelical"", and ""Traditionally Black"" (Black Protestants are obviously also found in Mainline and Evangelical congregations)--this comes out of Wuthnow's Restructuring of American Religion.  Honestly, though, this framework just isn't being used so much in contemporary research (it's still being used, just not so much).  I only learned it in a cursory way in my graduate training.  Church-sect gave way (in America) to denominationalism, but there's a growing sense  that denominationalism has given way to something else (in America).  There was a big trend of looking at religious ecology as a ""market"" (globally) rather than churches vs sects, but even this is less popular to do and even when it was popular, it received a lot of criticism.  The economies of religion/religious markets approach has really subsumed most of Church-sect theory, but also really dispensed with it in practice.  The debate left behind churches and sects and went over almost completely to secularization.  That said, if you want to clear up what the terms mean in past analysis, Hartford Seminary has usefully put up a lot of the entries for Encyclopedia of Religion and Society online (some entries I think have been updated, but it's really from 1995).  Here's the table of contents.  Entries you probably want to read include: Church-Sect Theory; Denomination; Cult; Wuthnow, Robert; rational choice theory; Stark, Rodney."

AskSocialScience,2yos0r,yodatsracist,1 point,Thu Mar 19 07:57:03 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I read Weber on religion, but I think he just doesn't cover those types of religions. He's mainly concerned with the ""World Religions"", so he writes about Judaism, Islam, ""the Religions of China"", but not such local religions. I also haven't read The Invention of World Religions by Tomoko Masuzawa in awhile, but if memory serves, that's about what we'd expect from Weber's time. There were early precedents, before modern anthropology and during Weber's lifetime--Durkheim and Freud wrote about totemism, E B Tylor wrote about animism, Max Müller wrote about naturism, and Frazer has his elaborate work on myth and ritual--but those approaches were distinctly new takes on religion. So it's not totally surprising that Weber didn't write about ""primitive religion"", as it was often called at the time.  So have you heard the terms in statistics dependent and independent variables? The independent variables have causative influence on the dependent variable. Gender and level of education affect earnings, right, so in that case gender and education are independent variables and earnings is the dependent variable. All the people from this period who looked at ""primitive religion"" (up until the rise of modern anthropology, and Malinowski, Boas, Evans-Prichard in particular) tended to look at as the dependent variable--they were interested in what led to primitive religion, and therefore what led to all religions.  Weber, on the other hand, was primarily (but maybe not exclusively) interested in religion as an independent variable--how religion affected economy and society, how Calvinism helped spur capitalism, etc. That could help explain their differences.   You might be interested in Daniel Pals's Eight Theories of Religion, which is the best summary of all the major thinker's takes on religion, from Tylor through Geertz. It's a good introduction to how people have historically thought about religion (there are a few more recent theories I wish Pals would add, like rational choice)."
AskSocialScience,2yoiz9,blueberry_crepe,3,Wed Mar 11 14:36:24 2015 UTC,"If you want to start with neofunctionalism, you should go read Ernst Haas, which is the starting place for this theory.  You might even go back to read David Mitrany to understand functionalism.  Neofunctionalism broadly fits within the liberal school of IR theory.  It's about organizations, institutions, economic integration, regional integration, and forms of governance/union between or above states.  These are all central topics in the history of liberal political theory.   Is it more rationalist (realism/liberalism) or constructivists?   This seems to be a misunderstanding.  Realism and liberalism are not rationalist theories.  There can be rationalist realists and rationalist liberals.  There can be rationalists that are neither realist nor liberal.  There can be constructivist realists, constructivist liberals, and constructivists that are part of neither school.  Insofar as neofunctionalism is part of liberalism, you can find both rationalist takes on it and constructivist takes on it.  Depends on who you're reading, and what their particular ontology/methodology is.  EDIT: a good place to start is always to look for review articles.

AskSocialScience,2yoiz9,EssentialPepin,0,Thu Mar 12 04:55:06 2015 UTC,"Since you're writing a thesis on the subject I'm sure you know much more about neofunctionalism than me, but just to throw my 2 cents in, I see it as more rationalist and positivist. Especially so, since it comes out of liberalism.   I think my biggest question to you is do you need to define this delineation? In practical use all paradigms have to accept a degree of individual and social choice, because inherently what they are creating are models of the world that cannot answer all. For example, realists claim about what states MUST do, then they come out criticizing politicians about doing the wrong thing. Unlike realists, Liberals cannot argue liberalism is inherent to man, thus today's liberal world came about only due to a societal/cultural change.   So, only looking within the model, not yet how it relates to the real world what is the determining factor about the theory? This may be different for the start of regional integration, and you'll be able to answer that better than me, but neofunctionalism, in my opinion, suggest narrowed actions for rational actors under specific conditions. In this way the interest of the actor is not changing for subjective reasons.   I'm re-reading about it now to refresh my memory, but it seems there would be less contention about neofunctionalism and rationalsm, than functionalism, which seems to attempt to account for value changes. So, here there are elements of identity, but from my understanding they only go one way, making it less subjective than constructivists. Neofunctionalism, however, has more objctive reasons for integration.  I'm looking over Moravcsik's work on intergovermentalism, where there seems to be more choice by governments for how much integration, than as a systemic result of spillover. There you may find more arguments if that is a focus in your thesis. I'm not sure how Moravcik is identifying states as actors though, but I'm sure you could argue that it comes from social pressure.  So, I think neofunctionalism is quite strongly rationalist, if you want to compare something that MAY be more constructivist then my first look would be in Moravcsik's Intergovermentalism  I would especially look toward this citation: Sandholtz and Stone Sweet, ""Neo-functionalism and Supranational Governance"", and try to find those related to it."
AskSocialScience,2yoiz9,emptynothing,1 point,Wed Mar 11 15:46:34 2015 UTC,"Here is the Sandholtz and Sweet article.  I agree about how neofunctionalism needn't be differentiated from wider IR theories.  If you start with the Monnet Method, and work through the SEA, then Maastricht and beyond, you can see constructivism in how the idea of integration becomes normalized; liberal theory in the power of non-state actors and institutions constraining the policy options of state actors; and realism in the strategic manipulation of creeping supranationalism to serve the interests of individual states.  My own interest in neofunctionalism and supranationalism is how policies for internal cohesion in the EU, namely the elimination of trade barriers followed by harmonization of non-tariff barriers, was then turned outward as a foreign policy.  This foreign policy is at least to some degree neomercantilist, in an effort to balance against Japan and the United States, but simultaneously served to increase internal norm cohesion.  One theory of statecraft is that the act of statecraft has less to do with the issue under negotiation and more to do with creating the state. This idea that by projecting a foreign policy you are serving to justify the state is particularly salient for the EU which is working hard to develop a ""European identity"" amongst a collection of sovereign European states.  In this example, you've got constructivism, liberalism, and realism. As such, why limit yourself?  Regarding Moravcsik's intergovernmentalism v. neofunctionalism, I think they can coexist pretty comfortably in explaining the EU we've ended up with. Trade and environmental policy* as external diplomacy under the Commission are probably best described as supranational and virtually everything else is intergovernmental.  *keeping in mind that much of the EU's environmental policy is negotiated under mixed competence."

Realists argue that states face constraints that they cannot change simply through rhetoric or wishful thinking or changing their foreign policy.  States are free to do whatever they like, but it may end in disaster if they ignore the realities of power.  The realist argument about 'necessity' is an ethical claim—it's rooted in the idea that there is a separate morality for the state that is differentiable from the normal transcendent/universalistic morality that we as private individuals attempt to follow.  It's a justification for what would otherwise be considered amoral, immoral, or evil acts—if they are necessary, i.e. the state's survival depends on it.   Liberals cannot argue liberalism is inherent to man   They absolutely can and do.  Liberalism as we know it owes a tremendous amount to the Natural Law / Natural Right tradition—all sorts of liberal concepts flow from this, like individualism, institutions, practices of restraint, etc.  Adam Smith wrote about, ""a certain propensity in human nature … to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another."""

Do you want to calculate this correlation historically or only for the current day situation?  Be aware that whatever you do, if you simply try to derive some inference about the relationship between domestic country parameters (political systems, strength of economy, culture) and friendliness/hostility, you will run into problems by omitting a range of other factors that likely contribute to whether two (or more) countries are friendly or hostile towards each other. Most of all, as I mentioned in my other comment, if we think of the international system between states as a social network - and I believe that is a good approach - then it is probably right to assume that certain attributes of the nodes (i.e. states) in the network do contribute to the forming (or dissolution) of edges between them. Said differently, it appears likely that two countries' political systems, cultural affiliations, geographic proximity, etc., contribute to the edge-forming process. However, and this is where problems arise with models that only look at two states in isolation, network effects and interdependencies will likely also play a role. What this means is that, if we have three states A, B, and C, where A and B are friendly towards each other and A and C are hostile, this will have an effect on what B chooses to do. Maybe the domestic variables would tell B to associate more closely with C, however due to its alliance/good relations with A, it might decide to become hostile towards C instead.   These interdependency effects are not captured well with correlations or regressions that use tie formation as dependent variables and country variables on a country-pair basis as independent variables.  Conclusion, if this is only a small interest/personal research you're carrying out, you might get away with a few simple correlations, however if this is done in a more rigorous research framework, I would caution against using just correlations or related approaches.  Edit: In order to provide something to actually help you move forward, here are some data sets you might use:   The Correlates of War   Various historical data sets, including militarized interstate disputes which you might use to infer some kind of animosity between countries over time.

Varieties of Democracy Dataset   I am less familiar with this one, but it aims to code a historical dataset that captures different types of democracies over time.   Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT)   The last one is for only the case in which you feel adventurous. I haven't worked with it myself, but it's a whole different beast and requires significantly more coding, preprocessing, and managing on your part before you can use it for your purposes.

The most fitting approaches, in my opinion, model the international system as a social network where 'friendliness' and 'hostility' are represented by the existence of edges between states. This runs into problems of how to model temporal change, how and where to set those edges (merely existing diplomatic ties, or common membership in a military alliance?), and how to include interdependency of the existence of network ties (i.e. Britain did not make the decision to enter into a war with Iraq in 2003 without considering the U.S. decision to do so, and this interdependency has to be accounted for)."

The earliest academic reference I could find that tried to explain why speaking of money was a taboo was, unsurprisingly, Freud. And, even less surprisingly, he related it to anal eroticism. (As a quick aside, I'm really beginning to wonder if a cigar was just a cigar) 1. There is good reason to believe that the taboo persisted well before that, but it is the earliest reference I could personally find.   Without a definitive start date, some may be inclined to believe that  we've always had this taboo-- or at least some type of it. Personally, that's the attitude I went into this question with. After all, money has been around for over 4,000 years 2 and our tribal psychology invites trepidation into situations where our social standing is on the line. Indeed, some have speculated that discussions of money fall under such situations 2 since we often tie worth to income and to financial price 3.  This could reasonably lead people to conclude that it's simply inherent to human thought. Talking about money can dredge up a lot of social comparisons and expectations which could trigger that tribal instinct saying ""let's not put ourselves in a lower position on the social strata so that we're not eventually ostracized 5.""  There's only one problem with this: If it was universal, we would expect different cultures to have a similar reticence to income. But they don't 6. Even countries as geographically proximal as Japan and China have different attitudes about money as indicated by their folklore 7.   So we are left with the idea that this is a western construction. To be clear, I definitely think that the proclivity to tie social worth with the amount of stuff one has probably dates back quiet a while as it would be a handy hint throughout much of human history. But the actual taboo seems to be western in origin.  I don't think that we'll be able to find a specific date, time, or even location to pin this origination on. However, if allowed to venture an educated guess, I would posit that they came from our coffee shops.   It's well known that coffee and tea shops were instrumental to the formulation and actualization of many western uprisings 8. These institutions looked to turn the current social status quo on its head. Inside the shops, everyone was theoretically equal. A certain code of conversation developed, largely thanks to the propagation of two magazines: The Spectator and the Tatler 9. I cannot find any direct quotes from either publication that specifically dictates that one ought not to make note of the socioeconomic differences that exist outside of the shop-- however, there is decent evidence for tacit recommendations via the emphasis on maintaining a tempered and productive conversation 9. I contend that it's difficult to have a good chat when you're being actively singled out as an impecunious peon. Such an account would work fairly well with our theoretical understanding of taboo construction. As it goes, taboos are extremely strong norms and mores that deliver intense social (and possibly even official) sanctions 10. They can develop from social rules and evolve along with the society; hence why some taboo subjects are less taboo as they used to be and others are even more forbidden. I would venture that the taboo for discussing income developed on this track. It could have started off as an expression of politeness and proper etiquette and developed more bite as western society grew more infatuated with the idea of human equality. There aren't any studies that directly prove or disprove this theory (possibly due to a dearth of literature on the topic of money 2), so take it with a grain of salt.   I would also like to recommend the book that U/David_divaD did as well as The Psychology of Money by Furnham and Argyle."

AskSocialScience,2yjwar,TotesMessenger,3,Tue Mar 10 21:29:51 2015 UTC,"We can say that it probably contributes to it, yes. However, we can't say for sure that the discouragement of employees to discuss their salary at work is the main cause behind the social taboo.   Businesses discouraged workers from communicating about their pay since such discussions would increase tensions in the workplace and increase the odds that the workers would organize. In response, the United States government passed the ""National Workers Relations Act"" in 1935 which prohibited any such discouragement by employers, even tacit discouragements 1.   The thing is, this taboo persists in a number of realms that seem outside the scope of the workplace. Many couples, for instance, seem to have a money taboo as well and this particular incarnation can be understood through a broader social lens rather than as an externality of a workplace policy [2](www.terapiafamiliar.cl/intranet/archivos/Money.pdf).   So did it contribute? Absolutely. Is it the primary driver? We don't know. But it seems more feasible that there are a number of social factors working in concert and feeding off the effects of one another than to point to any one cause in particular and say ""this is it."" But I suppose that's true of many questions in the social sciences.  As a quick aside, there are a couple of good sources about the NLRA that you might be interested in. One from Reddit and one from the Atlantic.  Edit to attempt to fix the formatting, but evidently it just wants to be stubborn"

Instead, assemblage is similar to ""bricolage"" works to describe an idea (Derrida and Deleuze both use the term but differently I think), or maybe Différance, or the ""rhizome."" These are not theories but ideas that those writers use to describe a very complex interworking set of ideas.  This article on SEP might be worth reading, but I will try to ELI5...  Lets say you have a bunch of candy. Your candy is all mixed up and you might want to sort it out. You take the peanut M&Ms and put them to the left, the chocolate M&Ms to the right, and you like the Smarties best, so you push to the center. You also have gummy worms, which you hate, so you throw those into a wastebin below the table. Keep in mind, there is variation in the candy; the gummy worms are different lengths, some peanut m&ms are bigger and smaller and so forth. They aren't uniform.  This is how you are making sense of the order of your candy. you are coding out the different types of candy. you are stratifying them by putting the Smarties in the center and throwing the gummies in the trash. But the actual spatial grouping is an assemblage, a ""territorialization"" of bodies or concepts where they are grouped accordingly.  Despite the non-uniformity of each individual piece of candy, the ""multiplicity"" of chocolate m&m's is absorbed into the assembledge of that pile. Collectively, that candy is a ""rhizome"" with no real hierarchy, but an intermixed relationship of connections.  At least that's just my take on it, and a weak ELI5 attempt."

When ""asset freezing"" is used by State A as a sanction against foreign nationals/parties belonging to State B, in a practical sense it typically means that State A will freeze any and all assets under its jurisdiction (i.e. funds deposited in an account in a bank owned by State A) belonging to the nationals/parties in question from State B. ""Asset freezes"" also usually include outlawing any entities from State A from doing any business with the foreign entities in question. ""Asset freezing"" as an international sanction does not go as far as to freeze assets held in the foreign entities' home country (or any other country not participating in pressing the sanctions).  For example, when the US says it will be freezing the assets of a group of individual Venezuelan officials, it doesn't mean that the US will be able to freeze the money that they hold in Venezuelan banks or foreclose on their house in Venezuela. Rather, it means that they will freeze any money held in US banks, investments in US companies, etc. and outlaw US entities from engaging in any sort of business with them. The overall point is that such sanctions are only effective if the entities at the receiving end happened to have a lot of assets tied up in US firms at the time the sanction came along.  On the 2011 US freeze of Libyan assets  On the new US sanctions against Venezuelan officials  On EU restrictive measures (including asset freezes) against foreign entities  On multilateral asset freezing as used by the United Nations Security Council"

AskSocialScience,2yhnna,jasonvsjason,14,Mon Mar 9 22:06:17 2015 UTC,"Before starting, I want to distinguish between two types of possible wage inequality:   Women are paid less than men for the exact same job The average woman is paid less than the average man    Type 1 would probably be generally considered more problematic than type 2 (because there are a lot of possible confounds in type 2), but both might be considered ""wage inequality.""  There are a number of reasons why wages might be different between two groups of people (in this case between men and women).  One reason is that the employer likes one group more than another. This is discrimination based on preference, not anything related to employee productivity (more believable in the case of race-based discrimination than gender-based discrimination, but still possible). In this case, employers who do not share this preference could hire members of the disliked group at a wage lower than (or equal to) the wage of the liked group and profit more than (or equal to) the discriminatory employer. In that sense, free markets disincentivize wage inequality (there are conditions under which wage inequality is completely eliminated and other under which it is not, but it is always costly to discriminate). This case deals specifically with type 1 discrimination from above. It is commonly called ""employer taste-based discrimination.""  There is also ""consumer taste-based discrimination."" In this case, consumers don't want to buy goods or services produced by a disliked group. For instance, if consumers don't trust women to make cars, then they won't pay as much money to buy cars made by women. This, too deals with type 1 discrimination, but with consumer taste-based discrimination, free markets will not disincentivize wage inequality because the disliked group in effect has less productivity (even though their product may be the same, people believe it is different). So, it is most profitable to pay the disliked group less than the liked group.  For more information on the above paragraphs, check out Becker's The Economics of Discrimination.  Another reason is that there is incomplete information about potential employees' productivity and employers believe that certain groups will be more productive than other groups even with the same observable credentials. For instance, employers might believe that women are less productive than men, even if they all have college degrees. Then we have a vicious cycle: the disliked group sees that it will not be get the same payoff for its human capital investments, so it doesn't make those human capital investments, so employers' beliefs about their abilities are true, etc. If women don't think they'll get paid well with a college education, they just won't get one. This is a case in which the risk of type 1 discrimination turns into type 2 discrimination. It is commonly called ""statistical discrimination,"" and the nature of the vicious cycle makes it so that free markets will not discourage wage inequality (we are trapped in a ""bad equilibrium""). For more information, see Phelps (1972) and Arrow (1973).  Another reason why there might be inequality is that there are differences in preferences or abilities between genders.   For preferences, we might think about risk-taking. The general consensus is that men take more risks than women (for example, see: http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/125/3/367/). In the labor market, risk-taking can be rewarded with higher wages. For type 1 discrimination, we could think of a man and a woman with the same job, but the man is more willing to take the risk of asking for a raise. For type 2 discrimination, we could think of a man who is willing to work in a dangerous job which pays more and a woman who wants to work in a safer job even though it pays less.  For abilities, we could think about something like upper-body strength. Men generally have more upper-body strength than women. If jobs require upper-body strength, that could mean higher wages for men. For type 1 discrimination, a man and a woman could both work as construction workers, but if the man is able to do more tasks because of his strength, then he might get paid more. For type 2 discrimination, women may just avoid jobs that require larger upper-body strength even if they pay well.  When economists think about preferences and (innate) abilities, they generally take them as given, so when it comes to preferences and abilities, free markets will not promote wage equality. However, because those preferences and abilities are given, the resultant wage inequality isn't a bad thing; it's just a matter of pricing the job so workers can decide where to work."

The Federal Reserve sends most of the money they make on the federal debt back to the Treasury every year; so from the Government's point of view the reduced interest payments would be almost exactly matched by lost income. The Fed's balance sheet is mostly the money supply on one side and its share of the federal debt on the other.  If they wrote off all their debt their balance sheet would be pretty messed up.  This could have various different consequences depending on what they/the government decided to do next. The Fed uses the money it makes on interest on the debt to pay its employees and fund its operations.  If they wrote off the debt and got money appropriated by congress instead it would reduce their independence, and this could result in inflation over the long run. The Federal Reserve's member banks get a cut of the Fed's profits to offset some of the costs they face from being part of the federal reserve system.

If they tore up their portion of the federal debt tomorrow this would cease to be even kind of true, so no we wouldn't.  As far as the Federal Reserve being a private bank, this is again kind of true.  The Federal Reserve was created by an act of Congress, its most important officers are appointed by the President, but it doesn't get its funding from the federal government like the Treasury Department does.  The Fed is private in the same sense that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is private, which is to say not really.   On top of this, if (as in the OP's post) they forgave their portion of the federal debt the Fed would either need to receive money directly out of the federal budget or go out of business.

AskSocialScience,2ycfe2,jhn67,4,Sun Mar 8 16:03:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this is what you're asking, but Bernanke, in a lecture he gave on March 2005, believed that during the mid-2000s the US and other developed countries experienced a global savings glut, that lowered long term interest rates around the developed world (ceteris paribus, increasing bond prices).    To be more specific, I will argue that over the past decade a combination of diverse forces has created a significant increase in the global supply of saving--a global saving glut--which helps to explain the relatively low level of long-term real interest rates in the world today.   Indeed, historically most changes in the federal funds rate led to proportional changes in longer term securities, up until 2003-2007 when they ""unhinged."" Longer term securities stayed put, if not decreased, while the federal funds rate went back up.   To further elucidate, take a look at global savings by economy: http://www.voxeu.org/sites/default/files/image/FromMar2011/MeesFig4(1).gif. Global savings rate among emerging economies doubled from 2000-2008 to 44%, and advanced economies went from accounting for 78% of global savings to 56%. [Emerging asian economies were flocking to fixed income assets.](www.voxeu.org/article/us-monetary-policy-and-saving-glut)   The reason interest rates decreased is because as follows: We know that on aggregate, one country's current account surplus is another's deficit. Any excess domestic savings over investment becomes one country's current account surplus. If there is an excess in savings, then an increase in one current account surplus will increase another country's current account deficit. This will be achieved by a movement down the savings and investment curve, through a lower interest rate. The savings glut is thus an outward shift in savings in emerging economies.   At the time the US had an increasing account deficit, which meant that it was a net borrower. Since in a loanable funds model, an increase in savings lowers interest rates, and the US has had a low national savings rate, it has used its economic dependence on capital inflows to refinance mortgages and increase housing construction. If you look at Bernanke's speech, other developed countries also saw their account deficits increase, and housing prices soar."
AskSocialScience,2ybh4y,HisNameIs,12,Sun Mar 8 07:04:55 2015 UTC,"I can answer about Smith:  It fit into Smith's theories as the perfect example of what he wanted to get rid of.   Remember, in Smith's day it was more or less impossible, technologically, for a big business to compete without government protections. Take away those protections, and big businesses would fall of their own weight.    To buy in one market, in order to sell, with profit, in another, when there are many competitors in both; to watch over, not only the occasional variations in the demand, but the much greater and more frequent variations in the competition, or in the supply which that demand is likely to get from other people, and to suit with dexterity and judgment both the quantity and quality of each assortment of goods to all these circumstances, is a species of warfare of which the operations are continually changing, and which can scarce ever be conducted successfully, without such an unremitting exertion of vigilance and attention, as cannot long be expected from the directors of a joint stock company. . . . The only trades which it seems possible for a joint stock company to carry on successfully, without an exclusive privilege, are those, of which all the operations are capable of being reduced to what is called a routine, or to such a uniformity of method as admits of little or no variation. Of this kind is, first, the banking trade; secondly, the trade of insurance from fire, and from sea risk or capture in time of war; thirdly, the trade of maintaining a navigable cut or canal; and fourthly, the similar trade of bringing water for the supply of a great city.    In the EIC's case, it had a monopoly of trade to Asia. To Smith, if the Asia trade was profitable, there was no reason to keep people out of it. If it wasn't, there was no reason to encourage it (except for a limited time to establish it in the first place, that time having long passed when he was writing).   True, the EIC, being big and awkward, would probably not be able to compete with small, entrepreneurial traders. That was fine. Smith, contrary to popular belief, did not like private enterprise and hate government per se--he disliked powerful private capitalistic interests getting favors from government. In fact, he distrusted capitalists as a group--to him, the interests of society as a whole were cheap goods and high wages, while the interests of capitalists were the opposite.   The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never to be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention. It comes from an order of men, whose interest is never exactly the same with that of the public, who have generally an interest to deceive and even to oppress the public, and who accordingly have, upon many occasions, both deceived and oppressed it.    On the colony trade specifically, he had this to say:   Some nations have given up the whole commerce of their colonies to an exclusive company, of whom the colonies were obliged to buy all such European goods as they wanted, and to whom they were obliged to sell the whole of their own surplus produce. It was the interest of the company, therefore, not only to sell the former as dear, and to buy the latter as cheap as possible, but to buy no more of the latter, even at this low price, than what they could dispose of at a very high price in Europe.   Of the greater part of the regulations concerning the colony trade, the merchants who carry it on, it must be observed, have been the principal advisors. We must not wonder, therefore, if, in the greater part of them, their interest has been more considered than either that of the colonies or that of the mother country.    And the following quotes refer to how the EIC had recently conquered Bengal and quickly turned it into a disaster area:   It is a very singular government in which every member of the administration wishes to get out of the country, and consequently to have done with the government, as soon as he can, and to whose interest, the day after he has left it and carried his whole fortune with him, it is perfectly indifferent though the whole country was swallowed up by an earthquake.   No other sovereigns ever were, or, from the nature of things, ever could be, so perfectly indifferent about the happiness or misery of their subjects, the improvement or waste of their dominions, the glory or disgrace of their administration; as, from irresistible moral causes, the greater part of the proprietors of such a mercantile company are, and necessarily must be.   The government of an exclusive company of merchants is, perhaps, the worst of all governments for any country whatever."

It also depends on what the previous literature has said about casino income and why it has ""poor results"".  Are these results plausibly applicable to other populations or are they relatively unique to Native Americans and casino money?"
AskSocialScience,2yb1su,semental,2,Sun Mar 8 03:53:25 2015 UTC,"You could probably start with Edward Relph, Place and Placelessness (1976), and then you could look at Yi-Fu Tuan, Topophilia (1974) or Space and Place (1977), and possibly Cosmos and Hearth (1996).  And then, because that's the type of scholar I am, I'd recommend you look into diaspora studies. Because a lot of diaspora work deals with yearning for lost homes (in both spatial and temporal terms). Try Robin Cohen's Global diasporas (1997). I also like Avtar Brah's Cartographies of Diaspora (1996), particularly chapter 8.  In more journalistic work, try Pico Iyer's The Global Soul (2000).  One could also conceive of a possible panacea to placelessness in terms of cosmopolitanism (Vertovec & Cohen (eds), 2002; Appiah, 2010)."
AskSocialScience,2yb1su,phdee,1 point,Mon Mar 9 17:02:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this detailed response.  It does seem like diaspora studies are very relevant but my gut reaction is that the Jewish culture is unique as it is so intertwined with religious tradition. Is shared religion the bond that allows Jews to retain a sense of place and belonging while living globally?   Religion does seem to provide identity and community for many people, so much so it almost seems to be the only thing able to fill that role.  How do you think about place/culture/belonging in individuals whose families are from multiple cultures? Do these individuals just choose one group to identify with most then hope they are accepted ?  Cosmopolitanism seems less like a panacea to placelessness and more like the problem. If you are to identify with everyone then this is basically the same as identifying with no one. I believe in the idea of a global society but am concerned with how the loss of place/belonging/roots affects individuals.   I am sure this is why subcultures develop but belonging to a hobby-based subculture seems more ephemeral than a familial/cultural heritage.  Any additional quick thoughts on these issues will be appreciated."
AskSocialScience,2yb1su,phdee,2,Mon Mar 9 17:54:27 2015 UTC,"Diaspora studies encompass much, much more than the Jewish diaspora - sure, the concept has its roots in that particular diaspora, but as you'll see in the texts I recommended, there are so much more diasporas out there, and types of diasporas, even.  Shared religion is a huge thing that contributes to a sense of community, but like the diaspora types, it's not the only thing. There are multiple ways shared identities can form, be it through language, ethnicity, common/shared idea of home, any and all cultures, including popular cultures.  People and communities have multiple identities. There is no requirement that individuals have to choose one group to identify with. We are all moving points within the intersection of things - class, race, gender, beliefs, geography, etc.   One of the facets of cosmopolitanism is precisely homelessness/placelessness. There's a great article somewhere, but I can't remember it right now. Anyhow, one can consider that homelessness needn't be an entirely negative thing. If one can accept one's rootlessness, then ultimately the being tied to places can be seen as a constraint. Cosmopolitanism can get very zen Buddhism..."

If you look at a very simple plot (courtesy of Simon Wren-Lewis) of growth in G (government spending) over GDP, we can immediately tell that while there is generally a pattern of positive correlation, there is still significant variation.  The most influential paper supporting ""expansionary austerity"" in recent years is probably Alesina and Ardagna (2010). However, an IMF study by Guajardo et al. the following year reached an opposite conclusion.   Now, in the following years several interesting papers have emerged that attempt to reconcile this contradiction. If you look at Jordá and Taylor 2014, they actually replicate the results of both Alesina and Ardagna and the IMF study and then build up on them to avoid problems of allocation bias. Their results show that austerity has a negative impact  regardless of the state of the economy but even worse so during a slump. A  meta study by Gechert (2013) also reaches the conclusion that ""public spending multipliers are close to one and about 0.3 to 0.4 units larger than tax and transfer multipliers... [and] public investment multipliers are found to be even larger than those of spending in general by approximately 0.5 units."""

While they are certainly connected through multiplier issues, they are distinct in my mind.  One is a signal aimed at easing loan terms from the international community in a time of crisis.  The other is (unwisely used, in my opinion) simply an argument about the optimal participation of government spending in the economy.  The ""good"" arguments for Southern European austerity are a simple comparison of the macroeconomic and political conditions possible with or without austerity.  That gets wrapped up in the costs of the Grexit, etc.   Austerity in the ""Northern Europe...Southern Europe"" sense is primarily a credibility effort.  Southern European countries seek funding and/or loan consolidation and ""austerity"" is a tool to lower perceived risk of government-budget-related default in order to secure interest rates lower than they would otherwise be.  The issue of whether or not payments can be made past the immediate term brings in multiplier issues. Reference here would be Corestti (2012)  The traditional arguments for low government expenditures and taxes are a separate matter.  Whether or not interventions are worthwhile depends on expenditure multipliers.  But to me, calling a scaled-back level of government expenditure in a generally stable economy ""austerity"" stretches the term too far.

With the multiplier being larger in fixed rate regimes, zero for flexible exchange rate regimes, lower than zero in open economies, and zero in countries with debt beyond 60% of GDP.  If you think about how monetary transmission mechanisms on the part of the federal reserve impact private investment and aggregate demand, then this can be explained by monetary offset: the central bank moves last, and neutralizes the effect of fiscal stimulus by increasing or lowering aggregate demand as necessary. This is particularly important for systems like the Euro, where there is a single monetary authority for different fiscal regimes, causing fiscal austerity to have a bigger impact in Greece, than say, in the US or UK.  You're probably familiar with simple plots that show a positive correlation between Government spending and GDP (as another commenter linked), but separating it by exchange rate regime makes a significant difference.

Further, the question of importance is how an economist are handling  the data from today.  Krugman and others like him- who clearly also have the imprimatur of the establishment, when they are leading the Fed or the IMF or the ECB (Draghi)- have done quite well in matching predictions to outcomes.  Meanwhile, the theoretical basis of expansionary austerity always rested on shaky grounds, and hasn't been borne out by empirical evidence.  Germany's example from the early 2000s does not hold up because it was austerity against a backdrop of inflation elsewhere and a trade surplus, which means it was really expansionary policy attenuated by some austerity.  And besides- and here comes some relevance to international trade- just like the theory of microeconomics doesn't hold up when you take the perspective of a national economy, you likewise can't have every country run a trade surplus and rely on external inflation to improve competitiveness."

AskSocialScience,2y3ulr,Aeraerae,3,Fri Mar 6 04:50:03 2015 UTC,"To examine the challenges of import-substitution industrialization, we first need to understand why industrialization is and why it works.  First you must understand that under any kind of industrialization, a source of capital and other resources to finance industrialization but exist.  Furthermore, no economy can industrialize solely on it's native commercial base -- industrialization requires the concentration of resources from a exploited periphery to a industrial core.  Sometimes that economic periphery is in the form of overseas colonies (Great Britian) or nearby Trading partners (Germany, France).  However, some very large countries have managed to industrialize by using their own continental frontiers as a periphery.  Both the United State and the Soviet Union attempted industrialization in this manner in the 19th and 20th centuries, respectively.  So why did import-substitution industrialization appear to work in the 19th-century United States and in early 20th-century Russia, but not in post-colonial Latin America or Africa?  The problem is one of availability of capital.  Whether under communism or capitalism, industrialization requires methods of capital accumulation to finance the creation of new capital-intensive value-added industries.    In both the United State and Russia, there were substantial stocks of unused resources, both human and natural, that were previously either unproductive or used for other purposes, but were harnessed toward industrialization.  So coming back to Latin America, we see that countries like Brazil and Argentina were the most successful at import-substitution industrialization, becuase they both had access for foreign and native concentrations of captial, and because they had large under-populated but resource-rich hinterlands that could be used for as ""periphery"" to provide resources for industrialization.  Smaller and more densely-populated nations like Ecuador struggled to succeed at import-substitution industrialization (ISI for short).  Additionally, there are two other factors that are necessary for ISI to work:   1) the state support for domestic industries must be targeted, not indiscriminate.  Instead of using tariffs and subsidies to prop up ALL types of domestic commerce, the state must deliberately pick industries in which it possesses a comparative advantage, to start the climb up the value-added ladder toward an export-capable industry.  Venezuela and Argentina were bad at this, but Mexico did a better job of it.  Basically, you can't have complete autarky AND import-sub industrialization.  Trying to do so results to the inefficient allocation of already scarce capital away from the sectors with a higher ROR towards a more equitable distribution of investment across all sectors -- which is bad, since we want to help the sectors with comparative advantages and a better return on capital investment in the medium-term.  2) The state mus be willing to ""kick out the ladder"" of state support, especially direct subsidies and tariffs, as the industry grows.  This step is critical for domestic industries to begin exporting with a mind toward the world market, but the domestic political actors (business owners) who benefit under ISI policies from both state support and a captive market will lobby heavily against it.  South Korea and Taiwan were relatively good at doing this in the 1970s and 1980s, but Brazil and India were not -- to their detriment.  Above all, I highly recommend you read  ""Import Substitution and Industrialization in Latin America: Experiences and Interpretations"" by Werner Baer in Latin American Research Review (1972).  This is an older work, but it was one of the foundations of modern study ISI, and get's cited by basically everyone.    Then, for a more modern take on ISI, read ""The Import-Substitution Model: Chile in Comparative Perspective"" by Eduardo Silvia (2007).     Also consider reading Gustav Rainis's work on economic development in Taiwan for a discussion of the practical similarities and differences between import-substitution and export-focused methods of industrialization.    The take-home here is that making ISI be successful can happen in one of two ways:     1) Large country with expandable domestic markets can use limited targeted tariffs to ""jump-start"" native industrial takeoff by harnessing it's own domestic hinterlands.  But this requires both that the domestic market be large enough to supply the needed demand, and that the government be willing to ""kick out the ladder"" once industrialization is underway so that competition on the world market can happen before local industry get too used to a captive market.  The 19th century USA is the best example of this done right, and Brazil in the 20th century is a good example of this done wrong.   2) A smaller country can industrialize by by combining a very activist and targeted industrial policy in combination with being well-hooked into global trade networks to supply the capital goods and resources needed for industrialization.  This model tends to look more like export-focused industrialization in it's later stages.  The best pure example of this is probably Chile, which despite significant political problems managed use it's mining industry exports as a method of capital accumulation to bootstrap it's way into higher-value industries.    This is all based on my recollection of an undergrad course on international development that I took back in 2009, so it may not be totally complete or reflect the latest understandings of the field."

In the US, there are multiple programs that exist to specifically address some of the problems you mentioned. Community policing initiatives often focus on developing relationships with the homeless -- I once did a ride along with a city cop whose entire job was talking to homeless people and intervening when a crisis was developing. There are also things like Crisis Intervention Teams, which are specially trained officers who deal with cases involving mental illness. Studies show that CIT encounters are far less likely to end in violence.  The court system also has some measures designed to divert chronically mentally ill people. Mental health courts, for example, use court-ordered treatment in lieu of jail. Drug courts can do the same thing for court-ordered substance abuse treatment in certain cases.  That being said, these things have come about as a result of widespread incarceration of the mentally ill. Since deinstitutionalization, the severely mentally ill population has shifted from mental hospitals to jails, prisons, homeless shelters, and emergency rooms. And the programs that exist only exist in counties, cities and states that allocate money for them."

AskSocialScience,2y0kdt,sedso,15,Thu Mar 5 12:27:53 2015 UTC,"Read Sober* on the faulty view of essentialism in biology. Basically he argues that we cannot determine the essential ""nature"" of nature as isolated from the environment. What I mean is, you can't say that a particular species of flower will normally or naturally grow to a certain height (which would be an essential characteristic of that species) because there is no way any species exists independent of an environment. So our understanding of biology must be ecological. That flower might naturally grow to be twice as tall if you artificially feed it nutrients and light, whereas in another environment it might be half as tall. Both are ""natural""   How this relates to humans and biological sex differences:  humans are a very clever species because of the extent to which we are able to modify our environments or adapt to the environment around us. By changing our environment (i.e., through culture) we can change how human nature gets expressed, in the way that a flower naturally becomes tall or short depending on its environment. Clearly something biological is happening, but it is wrongheaded to think we can ever separate out what is biologically happening (e.g., by focusing on what a gene is doing) without considering the external environment in which it is situated.  So, to get to your question, because humans are so good at modifying their environments, there is virtually no limits to how human nature will get expressed. This might sound controversial at first, but consider two groups of humans. One lives in a nutrient rich environment, where men can develop their greater ""natural"" muscular strength compared to women. The other lives in a nutrient poor environment, where men and women develop approximately equal musculature. Which statement better reflects human nature:  men are naturally more muscular that women, or men and women naturally have the same muscularity?  I am oversimplifying greatly to illustrate the idea, so don't focus on the factuality of the example but the underlying logic.  Any time you consider differences between the sexes, you have to ask yourself, even if there is some real biological difference, what about the environment allowed these differences to be expressed that way? There is nothing essential in biology, but people often view those environments as ""normal"" and then procede to argue that humans who have developed in such environments therefore reflect the essential nature of humanity.  *Edit:  here is the article I was referring to:  http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/186950"

AskSocialScience,2xuevb,lightningbender,2,Thu Mar 5 23:13:15 2015 UTC,There's issues like access to resources and social opportunity that factor into this.  Men are also more prone to impulse-control disorders (Sociodemographic Predictors):  http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=208678
AskSocialScience,2xu6jh,EddieVisaProphet,13,Tue Mar 3 22:23:25 2015 UTC,"Outgroup derogation - or in other words, your difference is perceived as (not is, but is perceived as) threatening to others who are part of an ingroup.  Chen-Bo Zhong published a paper on it in 2008 titled, ""Negational Categorization and Intergroup Behavior,"" I'd love to link it but the full study is on SAGE and unfortunately behind a paywall.   The Wikipedia page on the phenomenon is pretty sparse, but check out Ingroups and outgroups  Basically, we're socially inclined to like those who are most similar to us and then reject those who are different. It creates a certain level of homogeneity which increases comfort and also lessens fear. Anything seen as different from the ingroup is seen as threatening and counter-productive to the supposed goals and structure of the ingroup."
AskSocialScience,2xu6jh,wellyesofcourse,4,Wed Mar 4 13:17:08 2015 UTC,"Why are ""outgroup"" behaviors considered threatening just for being ""outgroup""? Where does the social inclination come from?"
AskSocialScience,2xu6jh,BassmanBiff,2,Wed Mar 4 14:46:22 2015 UTC,"The more I think about this, the more I'm inclined to believe that different schools of psychology would have different reasons for this, and that ultimately, why they do it is not really something that can be concretely determined.  Edit: In my head, the idea of some evolutionary reason keeps popping up. Like this tidbit on Wiki"
AskSocialScience,2xu6jh,wellyesofcourse,1 point,Wed Mar 4 15:36:58 2015 UTC,"You're correct, and the evolutionary psychology bit of it is very important to the study.  It all alludes back to the inherent nature, or state, of man and our need for social construct. The tribal mentality has basically expanded beyond our simple familial ties and grown to include those who are most like us in a cultural sense - which creates a large ingroup to defend against dissimilar outgroups and their assumed threats to the ingroup society."

AskSocialScience,2xwevu,rory_gibson,3,Wed Mar 4 12:17:53 2015 UTC,"Yes he was there by choice. He was disgusted by the apathy of western governments in the face of ISIS brutality and he believed that the west has a collective responsibility towards the minorities being persecuted by ISIS, because an awful lot of ISIS fighters are recruited from the west. I can answer and say this as a fact because I am Kosta's mother and he talked to me about the situation out there. I hope this helps answer your query"
AskSocialScience,2xwevu,Vasiliki66,3,Mon Jun 8 13:43:03 2015 UTC,"As far as we know, yes, he was there voluntarily.  That's how the media is reporting it, at least.  There are quite a few westerners who have travelled over to join the fight against ISIS. In fact there was recently a story about some of them leaving the YPG to join Christian militias instead, having discovered that the YPG is a very left wing group."
