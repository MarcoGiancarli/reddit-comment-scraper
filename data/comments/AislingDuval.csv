AislingDuval,3e3re1,vlts,3,Tue Jul 21 18:57:32 2015 UTC,Let's hope they will fix it soon. It's getting really annoying for everyone.   As for your question you're not doing anything wrong.
AislingDuval,3e3re1,DildoTuft,2,Tue Jul 21 19:34:49 2015 UTC,That is just stupid text they say. Nothing important and honestly I have said it before I hate how enemy faction ships are in our capital system. Drop and kill but check for wing or dodge them again just predefined text.
AislingDuval,3e3re1,lethaltyrant,6,Tue Jul 21 19:12:36 2015 UTC,"I hate it when they say, ""You're in the wrong neighborhood, pilot.""  Uh. This is my capitol. Nearest Federation system is at least 100LY away."
AislingDuval,3e3re1,VerneAsimov,0,Tue Jul 21 20:17:07 2015 UTC,It really is annoying and after awhile I let my guard down and sometimes i would drop and kill and continue. Well one time I was really annoyed as I just got out of an interdiction then another one happened being annoyed and angry I did not pay attention. I dropped went to go and kill and say the chat said nothing after the scan i realized it was an enemy player in an FDL I think I was in my ASP without a damn word he just killed me. In my own damn capital so not only NPC but players from other factions i think it was that stupid butt pirate one
AislingDuval,3e3re1,lethaltyrant,2,Tue Jul 21 20:22:24 2015 UTC,"this is a major problem with the other powers. also players do this to you as well, they camp the HQs out of boredom."
AislingDuval,3e3re1,Megatiger78,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:33:07 2015 UTC,"I'd say this is the problem with PP, and the game itself really. When i get shot down full of cargo I lose millions, and the murderer gets 400CR fine? How does that make any sense?"
AislingDuval,3e4keg,i3aden,2,Tue Jul 21 22:20:04 2015 UTC,"Greetings, CMDR. It is always wonderful to see another looking to fight the good fight for our Lady and the Empire as a whole. As others have said, ensure you look at the PowerPlay objectives document. The 13th Legion is an outfit who flys for our lady and you may seek them out if you wish. If you're looking for something, say, a bit more anarchic and strategical in terms of the bigger picture, I can provide you with combat opportunities against other CMDRs looking to stomp out the light of our Empire. If you're interested, send me a message. o7"

AislingDuval,3e253d,OnwardFlying,5,Tue Jul 21 11:10:28 2015 UTC,"Industrial control systems give high selling prices for Palladium and other High Value Goods.  So, sell your Palladium into an Industrial Control system (eg. Kapoongzi, Wababa, Grovichun, Gabjaujis, Karsuki Ti, Cubeo, Alluriates, HIP 114585, Okua'gsa and others) and buy Mineral Extractors for the return.  Hi-Tech control systems (eg Guuguyni, Kanuket) also give high selling prices for Palladium, but their Progenitors and Consumer Tech become expensive to buy and so worthless for trade.  The main concern for Control Systems is ""Potential CC"".  That's the way Powerplay works.  If it's Industrial, that an advantage.  If it's Extraction, that's a disadvantage, although if it's only low supply it's not a big loss."
AislingDuval,3e253d,Kryfield,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:42:11 2015 UTC,"In the end the best control systems are the ones with best potential CC income and low CC cost (ie close to HQ).  That's how Powerplay works. Best powers are the ones expanding in highest CC income systems. It's dead simple. Any other consideration is irrelevant and lead us to take bad decisions.  whether it's an industrial, high tech or extraction system is irrelevant. whether it will kill or create trade routes is irrelevant.  And taking these things into consideration lead us where we are today. potential turmoil upon our head despite being at rank 6 only. Only because we have a lot of control system with medium to low CC income.  Killing a trade route because we expand in a system is either a bug or a bad game design. We shouldn't take this into consideration when expanding anymore and believe Frontier will fix it eventually."
AislingDuval,3e253d,DildoTuft,4,Tue Jul 21 11:24:35 2015 UTC,"Considering trade at the cost of low CC gain was a good option when the overhead cost was based on exploited systems because low CC (gray/red) systems have a significantly smaller amount of exploited systems compared to high CC (orange/green) systems.   Now that FD intends to move overhead computations to the number of controlled systems, choosing low CC systems is a horrendous decision regardless of trade effects.  We're hit hard with the change. We need to maximize CC gain in our future expansions. The problem is a sizable percentage of our supporter base grinds merits based on profits and profitable trade routes are occasionally involve low CC yielding systems.  So we can't afford to consciously add to the number of low CC systems at the moment due to the impending changes.  At the moment, it's not a question of which economy is the better control system. Industrial systems just usually have a higher CC gain and High Tech usually with very low gain."
AislingDuval,3e253d,gnwthrone,3,Tue Jul 21 11:30:31 2015 UTC,Agreed. Focus on CC incomes as much as we can.  I hope the prep list next turn will look better.  I will submit few good systems for the next cycle to help gaining more CC.
AislingDuval,3e253d,DildoTuft,2,Tue Jul 21 11:43:13 2015 UTC,"Thankfully, there are several high profit clusters which were previously not present so our options are looking up."

AislingDuval,3e253d,DildoTuft,2,Tue Jul 21 11:54:32 2015 UTC,I'll put one up shortly. I have a shortlist of good systems but I'd like to get input from the community
AislingDuval,3e253d,gnwthrone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:46:18 2015 UTC,"Fine, I'll add my findings in your thread."
AislingDuval,3e253d,DildoTuft,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:04:33 2015 UTC,"I can understand your complaints about Tacahuti in this regard, but you have previously stated Industrial planets as control systems are the best.   If they are not, we need an eye on profitable High Techs for the next cycle so we have a place to trade.  @Dildo. Trading is a two way street between factionless play and Powerplay. You can't fast track without mad cred, and minimizing time2cred SOMEWHERE or two seems logical. We can convert factionless, and we can fortify/etc more cost effectively."
AislingDuval,3e253d,gnwthrone,4,Tue Jul 21 11:38:44 2015 UTC,"We explored the possibility of expanding into a High Tech system a few turns back with Selkadiae. However, potential CC gain dropped to near zero and had to be removed from the preparation options. Right now it's at +18 CC which is still very low.  A week ago I added selection criteria to the bottom of the google doc and noted that systems which buy high value goods (usually industrial and high tech) are favored however CC gain must be considered first.  I also went through my own post history over here in reddit and I have not mentioned that industrial systems are 'the best' control systems."
AislingDuval,3e253d,DildoTuft,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:47:46 2015 UTC,"I think the negative CC to positive involves borders with other powers, to make a side note on changing CC.

I have great experience with other mmog, where we - bunch of strangers - managed to form an united alliance, and achieve goals together.  Here, in ED though, I'm mostly disappointed and feel shunned. I have no idea who is who, who is behind ""Objectives"", and why? At this point I'm close to giving up, and just grind merits.  I like IRC myself, I think it's quite simple and available on almost every platform including smatphones. Although the chatroom is dead, so I guess I'm in minority."

The single most important thing is to work from the Angel recommendations document which is fairly reachable, in my opinion.

AislingDuval,3dy4h2,TNTOstepop,2,Mon Jul 20 14:13:10 2015 UTC,The sticky above has a link to our google docs. There's a section there regarding gaining merits via combat.
AislingDuval,3dy4h2,gnwthrone,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:58:15 2015 UTC,Depending your equipment you could participate in the ALD-led effort to undermine Archon's control systems. You should at least be able to travel 100-150LY to those systems be it via scooping or finding places to refuel and then return to a control system to turn in merits.  Most of the undermining targets are poorly armed and shielded so it'll help get your feet wet if you're just learning combat. It's likely easier than jumping feet first straight into a CZ or RES anyway.

AislingDuval,3dy4h2,PM_ME_UR_BCUPS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:49:48 2015 UTC,"A combat-equipped Cobra with a 4A FSD and 4B scoop should have enough jump capability to travel to undermine systems if you top off on fuel along the way.  Check out my post here about where to refuel/rearm/repair for whichever system you choose to undermine.  Keep in mind though that undermining doesn't technically help Aisling as Archon isn't actively encroaching on her territory. It's plenty good for a PP-related combat activity that doesn't cost you a whole lot of credits if you're just after merits, though. I did some undermining over the weekend for a change of pace from the usual CZ/RES farming and was getting about 300 merits/hour.  If you're taking a sip of the RP Kool-Aid, helping out fellow Imperial factions might count as a good reason for you too."

So I have zero proof, little cred, yet I probably know more than 99% of the people out there because I keep my ear to the ground, more importantly have the free time, and most importantly love researching and looking into all this.  I'm also terrible at diplomatic situations.   Honestly I think if they aren't aligned with a big group, they aren't heard. Yeah it can suck for them. But it gives the tightest security.  If they want their voice better heard they can join a lax group or try to make one with other like minded people.   It's either that or a ""cost"" of lone - wolfing it"

Anyway looking at your config (holy moley - 25 minute life support :) ), I might try the 1A interdictor you're using instead of the 2A I had, then I could get a class 2 fuel tank and save the class 4 slot for a SCB.   I'm going to give this setup a try, it's a farm-all-day setup."
AislingDuval,3dp3fw,GriM_AoD,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:10:57 2015 UTC,There's a string of two T Tauri stars between Kelin Samba and He Xians but I always top off at every scoopable star so I'm comfortable with the margins I have. I don't really like how slow a 1A scoop takes to fill up a Vulture tank especially with the heat generation so I felt better with a 4B scoop. Technically anything class 4D and up would still be plenty fast enough though.  I use A life support on long range stuff and shieldless builds. It's usually D life support when I'm closer to home but with a farm-all-day PvE pulse setup I have the power budget to run better life support. The extra power budget lets me keep my FSD on priority 3 as well so I can start charging the moment I start retracting hardpoints instead of waiting for that to finish at priority 4.  I opted for 2x0A+5D (15T) instead of 1x0A+5A (23.5T) in addition to 2B cells (4T) instead of 4B (16T) for the mass savings. I used three of five cells in a 2 hour session so I don't think the extra tonnage is a huge deal. Couldn't really justify the cost for a 5A generator either -- 5 million for 22MJ more wasn't worth it IMO. Dual chaff was enough ammo already anyway.  I'm probably going to just swap the repair module for a class 1 fuel tank though. It does bump me up from 3 jumps to 4.

Either way you dont become hostile by dropping 4 missions.   You should work with smooth station main faction to gain a better reputation. You can chose your mission more carefully ;-) or bounty hunt or do some trades. Your reputation will go up quickly.

I think the Empire and the Federation should always be rivals if not enemies, and the Independents should be pawns in this struggle, if not added threats that add unpredictability to the mix. Aisling doesn't have anything to gain by attacking independents, they are all far away except the Alliance and in lore terms Aisling has a lot in common with the Alliance. Right now the conflict between Empire and Federation is one of the few things that seems urgent and compelling to me in this game as they are competing for the same systems and have a long history of emnity. Turning the game into a long cold war between two powers where every conflict is clearly delineated and managed diplomatically is boring for everyone."

However, even though I'd normally call for fighting the Fed's in every thread I see talking it down, as they are just throwing up prep systems to bait us we could just let them have the next few turns prep make Control and stop wasting our resources (they don't want all these prep systems).

AislingDuval,3dlh5h,CMDR_Swift_Arrow,2,Fri Jul 17 06:02:30 2015 UTC,"Usually you can net a profit of 2500-3100 cr/t importing palladium from non-control systems to control systems. If you wish to maximize, exporting things like mineral extrators will boost the profit/t by 300 cr.  Just don't drop preparation materials to your source unless you want to ruin your route."
AislingDuval,3dlh5h,gnwthrone,2,Fri Jul 17 07:59:37 2015 UTC,"My theory is that the price of Palladium (and presumably other High Value Goods) increases by 5% in Exploited systems, and well as the recognized 10% in Control systems.  HIP 117187 is a backwater extraction site with a 4.7k Ls starport.  2 weeks ago it was selling Pd at 14.2k.  Now that it's exploited by HIP 116045 it's 14.9k.  HIP 114709 was selling Pd at 14.9k 2 weeks ago and today, both times exploited by HIP 114585.  HIP 108344 is not exploited and sells at 14.2k.  Beker has now received the 5% increase."

AislingDuval,3dlh5h,gnwthrone,2,Fri Jul 17 10:25:05 2015 UTC,I'm quite positive that it isn't an intended effect. The supply/demand level (low/med/high) goes up with the increased raw supply/demand rendering even the exploit bonus harmful to trade.  What it should be doing is increasing the raw supply/demand while leaving the supply/demand thresholds the same as from before the system was exploited.
AislingDuval,3dlh5h,Endincite,3,Fri Jul 17 11:18:05 2015 UTC,"100% not the intended effect. This is being discussed here   It may be a result of heavy trade volume. With the increased supply, what was once HIGH is now MED, hence the price increase. This is my theory, which would fit with the described effect which doesn't include a price increase for exploited systems."
AislingDuval,3dlh5h,gnwthrone,2,Fri Jul 17 12:56:58 2015 UTC,Has anyone brought the issue up to the developers?

So if you get your crappy prep suggesting in i.e.  Phra Mool, right at the changeover, the seed is set and the mindless grinders take it from there.  Our only hope is to outprep it now.  So to the group who suggested this and I know you read these - congrats, you've got a crappy system in our prep list and HAVE STARTED ANOTHER INTERNAL PREP WAR WITHIN AISLING.   We could be fortifying/undermining other systems, but no - we have to deal with the 5th column group that is too ignorant to see they are a 5th column.....  sad."
AislingDuval,3dj213,Jpotter145,3,Thu Jul 16 18:34:29 2015 UTC,"Another problem is that its high CC cost (172) means that it will probably push two of the beneficial candidates out of the preparation list (currently Lulus and Putanitu)  It's ridiculous.  It seems to be a someone's vanity project.  Probably to get notoriety with a Galnet article such as ""CMDR Laynor leads Imperial attack on Sol"".  Go join another power! They're ALL much closer to Sol than Aisling is.  Torval is the closest Imperial.  Here's the discussion from last week:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AislingDuval/comments/3cop95/powerplay_objectives_week_6/ct0njlm  We managed to keep Phra Mool out of the preparation list last week. Now, as soon as it has become visible, it seems that people rush to support it.  Our main enemy is not the other powers, it's other Aisling ""supporters"".    What's wrong with the Aislings? The other powers seem to have more sense."
AislingDuval,3dj213,Kryfield,2,Thu Jul 16 18:13:05 2015 UTC,"While the inclusion of this system would be negative overall to our power's efforts - prepping such a system isn't entirely without certain auxiliary benefits. While I am not arguing for directly supporting the prepping of this system, I am more neutral to the consequences of someone else prepping it. One benefit of prepping such a forward placed system each week is that it slows our rate of expansion growth by consuming some of our available CC and assigning it to a system that is much less likely to actually make it through the expansion phase. Slower and more controlled growth will help us better cope with our rapidly increasing overheads. A second beneficial consequence is that it acts like a shield. It's a very very obvious target for opposition during the expansion phase - one that it seems independent CMDRs just can't resist in opposing. By providing a designated point of conflict the remainder of our systems are less likely to see focused undermining and opposition efforts."
AislingDuval,3dj213,Rolesium,2,Thu Jul 16 22:51:08 2015 UTC,"All those ""forward base of operation"" gives is the other powers an easier-to-get-to spot to merit grind.

AislingDuval,3dkbxl,freedom4556,4,Thu Jul 16 23:32:45 2015 UTC,u/Endincite is on top of the E:D economics and trade stuff. I'd bet he has some thoughts on this.
AislingDuval,3dkbxl,brecksolaris,4,Thu Jul 16 23:49:26 2015 UTC,"Well, what we were expecting to happen in Beker (which was sort of a high-volume testbed to see the % change on a very large supply, as it happened)  seems to have either not happened, or the effect is different than expected.    It's possible that the effect on exploited systems only increases the replenishment rate of supplies and demands, which is nearly as good as a direct increase. As the system was no doubt under heavy trading pressure prior to the change, some time may be needed to reach a stable price.  I noticed after the control effects were ""turned on"" several cycles ago that there were some errors in Torval's systems that were later corrected. I have no information as to whether these self - corrected for some reason or were simply fixed by Fdev.  It could, of course, be bugged. I'm waiting until tomorrow to see if there is any change in Beker from previous figures. Feel free to report findings here if you notice a sharply increased supply, especially one above 800k,at any station in Beker.  If reports of a 750k supply reading as MED are true, then your bonus may simply not be keeping up with pressure on the supply from trade. The previous maximum Palladium supply in Beker from my information did not exceed 750k, so it's possible that HIGH may now be upwards of 800k,which would indicate at least a 10% bonus, though I (and I'm sure all of you) was hoping for something considerably higher.  The utter lack of transparency or response on these issues is beginning to infuriate me.  It may take a mass ""request for information"" petition on the forum to find out exactly what your bonus is, if we do not see noticeable change in Beker in the very near future.    Best Regards."
AislingDuval,3dkbxl,Endincite,2,Fri Jul 17 04:51:06 2015 UTC,"One more thing: the price range for a HIGH supply of Palladium at a truly massive supply (e.g. Gliese 868) is around 12500-12600, so if prices fall to around that range, things are looking up.. very up!"
AislingDuval,3dkbxl,Endincite,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:55:15 2015 UTC,"Do we know if Supply refers to the amount available or the replenishment rate?   For example, I could've sworn I've seen five digit supply numbers being labeled High Supply so I figured that was just a system under extreme pressure. I've never been anywhere with six digit palladium supply. The Dyaushibi source was ~50,000 and called Medium , but it was well outside our exploit range.  Lack of transparency on all game mechanics is probably my biggest beef with FDev right now. If I ever put the game down for an extended period, this will be why."
AislingDuval,3dkbxl,Endincite,2,Fri Jul 17 05:43:25 2015 UTC,"The high /medium /low only refers to the current stock level at that station. If it's near maximum, its high, etc. It has no meaning relative to other stations - a supply of 50 can be High if the station maximum is 53. Six digit Palladium supplies are relatively rare, but there are dozens & dozens in game, and even a couple seven digit supplies exist."
AislingDuval,3dkbxl,SpiritOfRedemption,2,Fri Jul 17 12:20:13 2015 UTC,"My guess is that, long story short, most of the < 13k routes get emptied very quickly. However, the rules of our bonus are not always entirely clear to me, either... I was rather shocked to find Palladium and Gold prices in the exploited Beker system to have skyrocketed recently to 13,5k / 9,8k respectively. That's with over half a MILLION to 750k available for sale per station. It's listed as Medium, though, so in this case it might need replenishing to High stock for the prices to drop.  However, commander, if you want a good trade route: It's a bit far up, but go between Kwatsu <-> Dyaushibi. Buy Palladium in Dyaushibi, bring nothing in return. That route should still be viable for a bit, especially as Dyaushibi has two ports selling the stuff. I haven't checked in two days though, and there are more players there now, but that's the route I've been running for a while. Good luck out there."

AislingDuval,3dhbnn,gnwthrone,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:24:04 2015 UTC,"Expansion, you say ""Merit grinders will handle Daibo"".  While this is no doubt true, we need a strong ""No not expand"" for Daibo.  We don't want this system.  It has negative CC.  While that probably won't prevent its expansion, it's a stronger direction which may prevent some people wasting their points there.  The ""CC Available"" for preparation has dropped from 1467 (last cycle) to 775 (this cycle) as the CC Overheads have greatly increased from 1197 to 2184.  This will be worse next week as more systems go from Expansion to Control.  Note that the penalty for not fortifying appears as ""CC Upkeep"", which has increased from 262 to 589."
AislingDuval,3dhbnn,Kryfield,0,Thu Jul 16 08:16:48 2015 UTC,"Agree. Unfortunately DAIBO case seems lost. The only chance was to outprep it with other systems last cycle. Currently it started gaining traction from merit grinders (50/8338), so whatever we do we're doomed on DAIBO front."
AislingDuval,3dhbnn,rdslw,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:58:10 2015 UTC,"The was no suitable system to outprep it with.  The only systems within the 15 Ly radius are 3 platform-only systems with even worse negative CC.  I wish we could have ""negative prep points"" to vote down an unwanted system, instead of trying to get ALL the good systems above it to force it out of the list."
AislingDuval,3dhbnn,Kryfield,0,Thu Jul 16 10:14:20 2015 UTC,I thought about strategy of moving higher four below systems. My calculations showed that it would be enough of 10k..15k to do it (9k was enough to move DAIBO to position 10).
AislingDuval,3dhbnn,rdslw,0,Thu Jul 16 10:31:49 2015 UTC,Organizing that 9k preparation materials is harder than it seems. That's the strategy we were gunning for but Daibo just kept pushing up faster than we could prep the bottom few from turn 6.
AislingDuval,3dhbnn,rdslw,0,Thu Jul 16 10:37:35 2015 UTC,"Would we earlier agreed on HIP 95256, I would have resolve DAIBO. Not having your support I needed to keep HIP 95256 safe (margin to Torval was around 25k at cycle end, so in effect we lost DAIBO because of it). That's also my mistake.  I faced mindless opposition (e.g. https://www.reddit.com/user/nisanick) who did nothing to help me (besides critique) nor resolve DAIBO on their own. Loud and vocal against others, while doing nothing on their own."
AislingDuval,3dhbnn,Kryfield,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:47:50 2015 UTC,"All your effort, and much more, would have been needed if EIC had contested HIP 95256 as they did 2 weeks ago.  But their withdrawal meant that Torval had to abandon it.  It will be interesting to see whether our Expansion there is heavily contested.  BTW, Does anyone know who organized the opposition to expansion at Ac Yax Baru.  That massive opposition dump  on Thursday morning must have been coordinated (it increased from 431% to 768%).  Effort was wasted in many places, as is always the case.  If we could have redirected the over-prep of Theta Octantis, for example.  And Koyans ended up 20k above it's opposition system.  But the game does not provide means to communicate strategy and advice to all the members of the Power.  This week is likely our last expansion for a while.  We'll be at or near a negative ""available CC"" next week.  I've put 3.5k points into prep in the 4 hours since the cycle start, to try and give ""good"" systems a good start, but I won't be able to play much this week to help further."
AislingDuval,3dh6bv,Gswine,2,Thu Jul 16 06:14:35 2015 UTC,"I'm going to guess burnout is going to be everywhere in Powerplay.

Under AA's influence, I think we will not have any expansion activity in that region in foreseeable future. From the activity report, I can see that we are a ""farmer/trader"" faction, spent most of our time in harmless activities(no.1 in prep/expand/fortify) and do not like to fight(no.9 in opposing/undermining). We might become one of the top 3 factions with this strategy, but it is boring.   I will have a break from this prep/expand/fortify cycle, concentrate on earning enough credits to equip my Anaconda and go oppose/undermine Winters' systems."

The Google Docs in the sticky helps to make sure we don't accidentally undermine the efforts of The People's Princess.  As for her legitimacy as heir to the throne... from a legal perspective Harold has been disowned so Princess Aisling is simply an extremely popular Senator. Lavigny-Duval, who is Aisling's aunt, will be legitimate once the marriage between her mother and the Emperor goes through properly.  If you need some quick creds help the community event in Carns.

It seemed suspicious, perhaps he wanted to see my location and movements?  After flitting about different systems doing some trading to replenish credits, I was interdicted and attacked by an FdL ""AshesOfHegemony"", faction Aisling.  No message, which is very bad manners.  Just repeated interdictions and shooting.  They weren't very effective attacks, but he was annoyingly persistent and eventually I needed to jump to another system to let the shields recharge.  He soon re-appeared, which was suspicious, so I got rid of the ""friend"", jumped, docked, and refueled.  Each time I tried to reach my last two trading stations, he was there.  So I went elsewhere.  It was an interesting diversion, but it wasted time.  Does anyone know who he is, or if he's part of a group?  Perhaps it's something I said :-)  EDIT:  I've found him: ""Reign of Annihilation"" group.   http://ra-elitedangerous.enjin.com/  I suggested that their policy of shooting neutral traders without warning or scans was a bad idea.   Kelin Samba is now Reign of Annihilation's forward operating military outpost. Reign of Annihilation will fan the flames of destruction across the galaxy, with you at our side, we will destroy anyone and everyone not supporting us.  Everything within 15Ly of Kelin Samba is now Restricted Airspace, anyone not aligned with Aisling Duval is ordered to be shot down, regardless of 'faction status.'"

Both strategies are valid but unfortunately conflict with each other.  It is not very nice to use sarcastic tone on commenting other's opinion just because the person does not agree with your group's decision.  In several occasions, AA members use the word ""orders"" for objectives and ""we leaders"" to address themselves. It is very misleading as I mentioned in other post, AA is not our leader, it is one of the groups under Aisling's flag. It is an organized one and kind enough to provide us objectives to follow, the objectives are not compulsory, however, it is just AA's view and not following them does not mean the person is misdirected.  We should have a council created to sort out our differences, provide us real official objectives and stop wasting our resources on infighting."

I can't speak for CMDR Ryudo54, but maybe the Angelic Council can be looked at again and put to good use but if anyone is interested in resurrecting the idea you could always let that interest be known."
AislingDuval,3d672v,Gswine,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:36:14 2015 UTC,"It will not happen unless the most influential of all groups is willing to join.  AA is in a strong position in directing the faction into their own way now. The failure of Sounti made them more unlikely to listen to other's ideas. Unless Ac Yax Baru and HIP 95256 are successfully expanded/prepared, they will think that those not following them are minority and ban all their request.   I must admit that AA 's objectives are mostly good objectives, the problem is they are too conservative. They do not perform well on foreign affairs and made some commanders not very happy. I am worrying the upset commanders might defect, or even worse, fed up and turn merit grinders. Our downfall might not from expanding too far from HQ but from disappointed commanders."
AislingDuval,3d672v,CMDRKMG,2,Tue Jul 14 02:37:25 2015 UTC,"The only reason we seem to be conservative is there is no real benefit for us to expand into systems far away from HQ. There's no in game mechanic that makes taking forward bases beneficial on any level. We're designing the objectives around the current powerplay rules. Unless FD changes the rules, we'll have to make do with what we have right now.  HIP 95256 is fine (with me) but since it's getting enough support, we don't need to allot any more commanders to that cause. Also, EIC (Torval) pulled out from PP so it should be less of a problem to take.  3 forward bases is already costly enough and adding a 4th will draw out more of our resources. If you notice how most of our fortifications only finish near the end of the cycle, then it would make sense to minimize adding to that cost. (Fortification cost of AYB = fortification cost of 2-3 systems close to HQ, minimum cost is 5000)"
AislingDuval,3d672v,gnwthrone,2,Tue Jul 14 06:10:28 2015 UTC,"@gnthrone I completely understand and agree with your position. Before Kwatsu and Kalana having something to call our own up out there, as standing bases for both expansion and defense seemed massively important.   Since claiming those systems and watching PP rules (or maybe just their effects) changing/becoming clearer as we go, claiming more space further away from Cubeo just becomes a headache of logistics that will actively work against us. (I'd hope for a change of heart on Ac but the subject now, even before the end of the turn, feels like flogging a dead horse)  How we keep ourselves from falling down the rankings, choosing systems we can effectively control, while those Powers further down the rankings expand around us and those above us expand beyond manageable limits (in 'our' space or not) is the head scratching problem to figure out and not rushing to become No1 is just prudent.    @ CMDRKMG and anyone else  There are RL problems that come from splitting decisions and effort between many forums, a Council in the kind of mold you'd like to see would have to be made up of those who have not joined the larger groups. Anyone feeling disparate, separate from other groups would have a chance to grow a voice.   Only then can you hope to make it worth the while of the larger groups to send envoys. Show interest, commitment and take on some small goals to successful completion that don't stand out on the GM as complete madness and show some understanding of playing the long game and you'll find a much more natural progression to seeing goals you feel important being prepped each turn. It should not be dismissed as undo-able without the larger groups or put at their feet as why something might fail."

Because we don't discuss Sounti nor AYB (and I didnt utter a word on them).

I'm not going to change my mind about them so why should i do it about your HIP. I don't say it doesn't have value, just for me that negatives are bigger than any value it offers. There is no mechanicto support your borders tactic (which is good if there was one from strategic point of view). Your system apeared in doc but it'smore about ""we need you elswhere you did enough there"" (sounti and ayb were in doc too but it doesnt mean everyone agree about them). They may've proposed system further than kalana and kwatsu, but it was before 5x increase in fortification. We can't fortify our current systems so why do you think it'll change if we get more distant ones."
AislingDuval,3d672v,rdslw,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:31:45 2015 UTC,"You're still wrong on few points:   you brought SOUNTI + AYB to this discussion as is they're making an argument. They're not. Also after change there were systems of similar distance (100LY+) brought into table, e.g. KAUKHE, so you're lying. It's not simply mentioning, read reddit: it was recognised as asset, worth to be defended etc.  inability to fortify is mostly because of PP burnout, not change (although x5 might have influence it) - look at the data of all powers. Look at the #5 cycle (already with x5 increase) data and #6. There is now a lot 'unfinished expansions' etc killer arg: you condemned this system, and called it one man effort, not worthy to be done. HIP 95256 ends cycle with 48k. Yet you were unable to put out of list DAIBO, where just 10k..15k would be enough. In effect you're criticizing someone for 48k effort, while you weren't able do your job. Accusing everybody while doing nothing. Put your money (time) where your mouth is.   Anyway we differ on the conclusion, I said it's fine two post above.  Besides burnout will probably increase, so our discussion will become moot anyway :) I personally think that major strategy for cycle #7 is going to be undermining and fortification."

I'm reffering to doc where is clearly writen "" Considering the amount of resources put into this system, we can’t afford to lose it anymore. Hopefully, Torval supporters will understand that this is not an act of aggression and that the ill will of a single person does not represent how the entirety of our community feels."" - i don't see here ""we were wrong and this is best idea"" and clearly not everyone like this idea, but since we don't represent just us but whole this sub, it's required to be there. if we wanted it just for us, there are other ways to do so.  to your ""killer arg"" (i'm amazed with your constant choose of words, and i'm sorry that it evokes in me that you are just joking about everything),  i personally did nothing for HIP 95256, but i didn't do anything for Daibo.

A 4A prismatic shield is actually stronger than the 6D I was using in my trading Python: ~490MJ to 455MJ. Add a couple of shield boosters and it should be fairly tanky for trading, and didn't lose any jump range. Now I have 272T capacity instead of 224. Prismatic shields are pretty awesome."

AislingDuval,3d1d46,laz777,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:40:06 2015 UTC,Yup.  Prismatics are fantastic for traders.   I dropped in a 4A on my trading conda (with 5 boosters) now I have 446 cargo and shields strong enough to tank most anything until I can HW if necessary.     I also dropped a lower sized A class prismatic shield into my DBX and Courier to get a significant boost in cargo space to make them much more effective smugglers without losing any shield strength.
AislingDuval,3d1d46,Rolesium,2,Tue Jul 14 17:16:42 2015 UTC,You will still need a class 4. So if you want a stronger shield but do not want to give up space then the prismatic will help. However depending on how few shield boosters you have the answer can get more complex.
AislingDuval,3d1d46,Gswine,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:50:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks - I suspected that would be the case. Stronger shields for the same cargo it is, then! Fly safe, commander."
AislingDuval,3d1d46,SpiritOfRedemption,2,Sun Jul 12 18:52:45 2015 UTC,"I have been using an A4 (2.4 mil) Prismatic on a Vulture with 2 top tier shield boosters and I've been very happy with performance strength and recharge rate, considering that the optimal mass for the shield is 285 and my ship comes in at 404.6 overall and that the Vulture's largest Power Plant still only has 15.6 capacity.   I've only used this for PvE but I've been able to take on multiple ships and been able to take down larger craft without worry.  How does this compare for the Conda? No idea, but I have tried similar setup on my Asp and been able to use the larger slot for Hull reinforcement so I reckon you can get away with using the lesser slot for a Prismatic and still be happy with performance."
AislingDuval,3d1d46,Gswine,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:24:30 2015 UTC,"An Anaconda flying an A7 Prismatic Shield Generator with 6 boosters has a slightly stronger shield than the regular A7 shield with 8 boosters. The effects really start to add up with the insane amount of boosters an Anaconda can fit. You can indeed downsize, but I personally prefer the biggest shield I can find and tank the damage."
AislingDuval,3d1d46,DragnHntr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:55:31 2015 UTC,"I might be wrong, but I thought shields were based on the hull mass, so always 230T for the vulture regardless of modules etc (so the 404.6 doesn't matter) - unless you're talking shield strength in the 404.6! (Which seems unlikely; a maxed 3A non-prismatic with A boosters is 249.9 MJ shields)"
AislingDuval,3d1d46,FAAmecanic,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:58:04 2015 UTC,"I don't really know how to quantify the effectiveness of shields but I was talking about the modules optimal mass which is listed as 285 tons. My Vulture's mass with all the modules is 404.6, so it's not running at it's optimal but well within it's limit (which I can't remember off hand). The Vulture has always been limited by even it's largest power plant (15.6 capacity) but I can run the shield, shield boosters, the laser and chaff ect while still only having to turn off the same extras that were always needed to be off with the old load out I used.    Still, I've been using it to RES hunt and the shield has been very effective for me but I should note that I am using only one large Beam laser and I am able to spare more pips in the shield when necessary as I am not draining the weapons charge as quickly.   The 2 shield boosters I'm using are helping of course. It may be that I'm not getting much more than you'd expect to get from a larger normal shield module but I reckon my shield recharge time is  very much improved. This is only PvE and it may come up short in PvP."
AislingDuval,3d1d46,DragnHntr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:22:56 2015 UTC,"My Vulture's mass with all the modules is 404.6   This does not matter. The shield only checks the hull mass of your ship, which never changes. Changing your ships weight does not effect how strong your shields are."
AislingDuval,3d2dpr,mokamok,2,Sun Jul 12 23:42:22 2015 UTC,Very good question.  You have to chose carefully to make sure you are helping Aisling Duval.  There are 2 major things to check :  which side is empire and which side has the type of government our power is strong against. You can read all this on the right panel of your ship. Clic on a faction to get details. Also read the description of each faction to make sure you are not helping criminals.  unfortunately if you have one side empire with a government we are weak against and the other side not empire with a government we are strong against I don't really know what's best.   I would chose the type of government we are strong against I guess.   But I would need some infos on this actually.  This should help you.  stay tuned. Pilots post updated conflict zones regularly with infos on which side to chose

All the Dictatorship minor factions are engaging in civil wars to gain power from the other factions.  It appears to me the side to pick is Empire first,  then dictatorship.  Make sure the side you pick is higher in influence and gaining with a green up arrow.  That usually means they are wining the war.  It makes it a lot easier.  Most targets are also being attack by other NPCs.  I pick the losing side by mistake once and two Annie and three vultures chased me out."

AislingDuval,3d2dpr,DildoTuft,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:24:02 2015 UTC,"We used to say Corporate for Expansion but this seems to be causing us problems. We are not good with Corporate Gov's during Control while a Faction like Winters is good in Control and Expansion with Corporate. So we are seeing many skewed percentage margins in their favor while undermining.  Why exactly is hard to determine.   Using another Gov type - there have been Patronage Gov Systems that have caused us problems and Patronage Gov Systems that have been favorable to us and again other Patronage Gov Systems that have been indifferent, leaving us and the underminer's with a similar margin to complete.  It looks like (I have no links to other threads to back this up and have not completed compiling my own thoughts on this), It looks like the system % relies not only on the Gov type but on how many Gov types, and how many other Gov type's Stations are in System.   I don't have any idea yet just how much of a difference this is making but I have seen some people say that a Civil War state that does not have the actual leading Power from the System involved will not effect things.   I actually am starting to think that changing any faction IS will cause some variance. A system with a single gov type/station will bring a massive change and effecting the balance of power between many system Gov type's with multiple Gov type stations in on system can cause a large effect - regardless of Aislings standing with that Gov type.  tldr -  Corporation is not our best option and we should concentrate on Communist, Co-operative and Confederacy Gov types even before Expansion. Even if you make sure that the Gov type is not Strong for an enemy Power we would be doing better % wise than we are right now."
AislingDuval,3d2dpr,Gswine,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:42:11 2015 UTC,"My recommendations in the Combatant CMDR posts have followed a general rule that favours Corporate Governments.  Mostly the CZs I spot are on the rim or outside of Aisling's Space, Systems with the potential of Expansion.  She is strong against Corporates when expanding, yet, is not weak to them under any (known) circumstance.  I agree, Control Systems should be managed so that Communist, Cooperative and Confederate Governments have precedence. I rarely pass through CSs.  My opinion - The Government of Preparation Systems, and any surrounding, would be best managed by reference to the weaknesses of the likely Contending Power while keeping in mind my aforesaid loosely framed 'rule'.  I will add that the income of Combatant CMDRs must have weight in the discussion.  A Soldier of Fortune requires liberty to fight for whichever side is offering the best BB missions and after that to consider PP preferences."
AislingDuval,3d2dpr,CMDRnooc,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:56:58 2015 UTC,"My recommendations in the Combatant CMDR posts have followed a general rule that favours Corporate Governments.   That is what I had been saying as well, however I find that it has become damaging.   The most likely Power to Undermine us currently is Winters and they are strong with Corporate Gov's in both Expansion and Control. So we should look to effect change in favor to our Control set even if the system is going into expansion. There is a hold on Gov phases after a successful Gov change and the time it takes to effect change again takes us well beyond the next turn for the Control phase.  Just look at the trouble we have been having with percentages for target.   Also as you have been putting this into practice, I'd appreciate some feedback on what you think about the number of Gov's and Stations in a System causing changes in the percentage targets :)"
AislingDuval,3d2dpr,Gswine,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:34:10 2015 UTC,"OK, still cool, my recommendations have been for Systems about as far from Winters' Space as we can get.  I mentioned elsewhere that a CMDR on site should use his discretion to modify my suggestion and have encouraged such amendments to be posted.   Truth is, mostly, I have only passed through a CZ System on my way to somewhere else, I do not stop, merely pause in my journey.  Have you a list of CZs in the Systems that you consider vulnerable?   If not, I am currently, and for the duration of the CG, located at Carns.  My plan is to have a look around that side of the Lady's Domain, feel free to point me in a specific direction.  Perhaps we can encourage Combatant CMDRs into the area and working the BBs to manage advantage."
AislingDuval,3d2dpr,CMDRnooc,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:03:49 2015 UTC,No not yet. Still just been studying the GM for Expansion and Control Systems that are causing us high percentages and then trying to figure why systems that should not be any real benefit for us (Gov wise only) seem to have massively lower percentage to hit targets.  If anything interesting shows up when I do start heading to systems I'll be sure to post. Could all boil down to 'FD never got Gov effects right.' which is pretty common knowledge I think.
AislingDuval,3d2dpr,Gswine,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:15:22 2015 UTC,"OK.   That stuff is not my interest, good hunting with that.  Edit -  Although, a thought, have you considered that most Systems are neither Control, Expansion nor Preparation Systems. What numbers apply to Exploited Systems?"

AislingDuval,3czoe7,jtackman,3,Sun Jul 12 06:12:50 2015 UTC,This CG should be good for our power. It will probably give us a good outfitting place and more CC for the system.  This CG is definitely a part of powerplay as a side quest and should be in our objectives list this cycle.  I'm on it and I hope more people will follow.
AislingDuval,3czoe7,DildoTuft,2,Sun Jul 12 09:53:28 2015 UTC,I think FDev is tossing out CGs every now and then to remind people that it's ok to do something besides Powerplay. Nobody's biting.
AislingDuval,3czoe7,brecksolaris,2,Sun Jul 12 06:17:02 2015 UTC,"Fdev, I think, also recognise the damage done to the longterm trade profitability of the Lady's Domain by merit grinders converting Hi-Tech Systems into Control Systems and wish to correct the error.  C'mon, +20% profit for a fortnight (3 weeks is it?) and zero additional after that; or +10% profitability now and forever: it don't take smart to choose the 10% forever.  On site at Carns I see almost as many foreigners as Aislings working the CG, Traders with an eye for profit and, I suppose, a touch of Community spirit.  Thanks to them for the assist, hope their accounts overflow.  This could be a +10% profit System for Traders forever; it is progressing only slowly, only Traders have bitten."

AislingDuval,3czoe7,Ninjaape0023,2,Mon Jul 13 05:40:04 2015 UTC,Pangilagara and Chona are the two cheapest places near by Carns.  Chona possibly the better location as the station is closer to the arrival point and the Robotics are slightly cheaper
AislingDuval,3d0rjp,dasfohlen,4,Sun Jul 12 15:35:50 2015 UTC,It might look that way.  But only if the carry out profit and the profit from CG achievement levels are not considered.  And especially if benefit to the Community does not bear on one's thinking.  My opinion – don't close the books until all the profit has been counted.
AislingDuval,3d0rjp,CMDRnooc,2,Sun Jul 12 15:59:22 2015 UTC,Looking at the comments I want to say that I miss normal CGs where I could possibly get a break from PP and all pilots from all powers would come together. It might help our power but I really want to stop with PP for some time. The whole galaxy is focused on it and I can't visit LHS 3447 to help a friend who just got the game without being annoyed by Federal Agents. Tbh the fact that PP isn't optional once you pledged to a power makes me hate the whole PP update. It is awesome but the fact that the whole playerbase is splitted without any possibility to come together makes me sad.
AislingDuval,3d0rjp,Zurgarth,2,Sun Jul 12 17:19:32 2015 UTC,Doesn't leaving a power effectively take you out of PP?
AislingDuval,3d0rjp,Zurgarth,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:45:21 2015 UTC,Yes it takes me out of PP but I have spent 2 weeks grinding merits. It would be dumb to throw it away.
AislingDuval,3d0rjp,CMDRnooc,2,Sun Jul 12 18:04:44 2015 UTC,"You can't reap the benefits of pledging to a power without also incurring the ire of that power's enemies. Either drop the power and regain the freedom of being Independant while, rightfully, losing your standing with the power you have just abandoned or stick with the power, retain your standing, and understand that you will have a target on your head in enemy faction areas."
AislingDuval,3d0rjp,DildoTuft,2,Sun Jul 12 18:32:31 2015 UTC,"For me, PP is optional and even the degree of participation is optional. I only contribute to tier 4 which is plenty for my game.  I recall the Diso CG, achievement bonuses increased my profit/ton by over 1,000cr, and there are a number of participants in the Carns CG from other factions who will realise a similar bonus windfall profit.  You appear to have other issues mixed with and motivating your comment; sorry about that, can't help."
AislingDuval,3d0rjp,Halfmead,3,Sun Jul 12 19:37:35 2015 UTC,like Powerplay it's not just about profit. Getting this CG done is a good thing for our power. And you have to consider the reward at the end.
AislingDuval,3d0rjp,Halfmead,3,Sun Jul 12 16:18:49 2015 UTC,"Chona (robotics) <> Carns (gallite) = ~1k c/t.   Admittedly, not the best trade route, but you do make some credits while (as mentioned) supporting our power, also the payout in reward credit needs to be calculated."

Next thing I know everyone is jumping out and not a word has been spoken.  So it seemed it was every Wing for themselves.    I wasn't a lead/wing commander for this event, I was a grunt expecting some kind of leadership (or at least a plan).  When everyone jumped out without saying a word.... I headed out and I wasn't alone.  I can get random instancing by myself and wasn't about to jump into a very hostile PvP system by myself without a plan for a group event.

That has no effect, as we found in a similar situation 3 weeks ago at Hollos.  We would need to get HIP 23824 into our own preparation list.  This means:   Prep it to 6k points and keep it there. It may eject one of our good systems such as Maiki or Kauruku. We are then stuck with this HIP 23824 which has a liability of -10 CC.   Leave it alone and Torval either don't expand it next turn or else they get the -10 CC liability.  We don't want it and probably neither do they.

Since Torval and us were very close before the change, but they have noticeably larger overheads they just managed to squeak past us into 4th. We're tied with them for standing value now at 64% (it rounds to the nearest percent), which is what determines the rank. Note: we don't really know how standing value is calculated."

So far I think they've done a pretty good job of selecting a good direction for us to advance as a power (with input from other players as well).  A few other things you could assist with at the moment include a community goal in Carns, or combat in conflict zones to support certain government types in our space that are more favorable.  Of course keep an eye on the reddit to keep up to date on any happenings, and if you have any further questions don't hesitate to ask. I like to think we're a pretty friendly bunch.  Good luck out there and fly safe, CMDR!"

(not to mention much closer to their other control systems than ours)  I don't think they deceived us the other cycle, rather there was just very little communication that we were preparing contested systems until it was too late for either side to stop it (thus the ensuing preparation war).  Torval also already has many systems that are closer to us than HIP 95256.  While yes it is a system with a good CC profit, it is also the only system on Torvals reddit preparation list at this time. I personally would rather not fight a second prep war for the same cluster of systems (esp if it's the only system they're focusing on), when we could instead focus on getting all the terrible merit grinder targets out of our own preparation list."

We will easily pervail them. At the MAIPUNA challenge we had three important factors against us:    we were doing Kalana and Kwatsu (loooong distance from control systems) MAIPUNA was far away without close control systems at that time (now we have CAILLI and DURYAMPS) Torval Scum started preparation run on Wednesday and we were caught shorthanded.

MAIPUNA was far away without close control systems at that time (now we have CAILLI and DURYAMPS)   No. We had Duryampas last time.  I flew thousands of prep points from there into Maipuna.   Torval Scum started preparation run on Wednesday and we were caught shorthanded.   Yes, they'll do the same again.  It was expected last time too.  Unless you have enough players willing to out-spend them throughout Wednesday night and early Thursday morning, then you will likely fail.  Last time, they had a python docked at Maipuna during the final hours to relay a minute-by-minute total to his team, so they knew exactly how much they needed to out-spend us by.  The effort did cost them their expansion at Naunin though.  Also Slavery is against the Aisling ethos."

It was impossible for us to concentrate. This isnt happening now. Apart Naunin they lost another one IIRC We were very close with MAIPUNA In the last day they concentrated on just HIP 95256 We were unaware of this till Wednesday - now we're. THey're bigger now in size (more control systems) and much more opposed/undermined (look at their cycle 5) - this is going to be much harder for them Also from player numbers (SYNTEINI last 24 activity confirms it) they player base is seriously reduced now in last 5 days. Mostly after Mining ""icecream"" Lance was revelaed :-) UBER ARG: the moment we knew about Torval Scum deception, even with their 'all hands on deck' effort, we easily (2:1 !!) opposed their expansion last turn. It clearly shows who has more power. Torval Scum is pro slavery, hence it's our longterm opponent. She based her existence on slavery. Aissling many times opposed her (search Galnet).   So yeah, I did my research homework and come to aforementioned conclussions. While of course mere me, can't change it without help of our fellow cmdrs, I support this cause and would like others to know facts for our HIP 95256 preparation.  P.S.

They deceived us on cycle 4th, and caught as shorthanded. Fine. On cycle 5, they throw 'all hands on deck' to expand HIP 95256, and we still beat them 2:1. Hence your argument 'it's hard to beat them' is false. When we knew and were prepared, their whole player base was not able to block opposition of HIP 95256. And should I remind you that we were working on SOUNTI at the same time? So no, it's not a lot of commitment. Just normal operation for ours.  And for you I posted also no slavery trade route, besides I do not promote slavery, I promote taking HIP 95256 from Torval Scum (hence opposing slavery) - leaving means to be decided by every one of us. So don't divert discussion please: this proposes slavery. No, I propose to win HIP 95265.  Also I said (understanding you ignoring uncomfortable facts):   hard data from prep numbers and last24 activity shows momentum change which is bad for Torval Scum. they prep much more systems this cycle, including one within WAYO MINA control zone, harming us and putting foot right in our territory. While PrismaticSHield is no perfect is gold compared to Mining ""biowaste"" Lance, hence we see influx of new cmdrs, comparing to Torval Scum   So to summarize things you're wrong on (and I'm really starting thinking if you're not Torval agent :) ):   they deceived us with MAIPUNA (we first announced it, and it was act of aggression against us) they started to harm us now (Torval Scum is preparing now HIP 23824) so this is normal  operation cycle of theirs - do you suggest to wait till Cubeo?!?! we outnumbered them hard in cycle 5 (opposed expansion) we can easily outnumber them in cycle 6 with no big deal (playerbase changes), confirmed by hard data long term strategy requires us to have proper borders this cycle will be much easier for us (no kwatsu, kalana), closer port CAILLI competing on perp phase is much easier than expansion phase against empire faction (Your suggestion about it make me suspecting you're a spy ;) we're against slavery, so opposing Torval Scum is good (even Aissling did it both in Galnet and in CGs in past) - everybody can decide how to do it.   To not leave you sad, I agree with you on that one of our biggest problems are solo merit grinders in our power :-)"
AislingDuval,3cny3p,DildoTuft,3,Thu Jul 9 11:20:14 2015 UTC,"Just saw this in the first couple of paragraphs of the update to PP changes from the FD devs  'So we’re going to gate expansion behind a CC wall: we’re going to prevent expansion taking place when a power is in deficit, and we’re going to prevent expansion succeeding if ownership of the system would push the power into deficit.'  Looks like it is intended to keep our expansions from ending us in Turmoil, meaning that non fortification of systems and the higher CC cost of Control undermining would be the bullet for a Power.  Unless expansion calculations come after everything else CC is figured out and we would just have less or even no systems with the CC to enter expansion?  Does anyone have any more info on how the recent changes should effect our attempts at CC control?"
AislingDuval,3cny3p,Gswine,2,Thu Jul 9 17:52:44 2015 UTC,Well expansions will be better regulated.  So we don't have to care about over fortifying anymore. I'd say let's fortify as much as we can.
AislingDuval,3cny3p,Gswine,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:03:44 2015 UTC,"The Devs were talking about some rather complicated system to take massive over Fortification into account within actual game mechanics. It would need links to explain, but as it's not there in the update I think they are trying to balance without encouraging over fortifying.  That still doesn't give me enough information to form an opinion on it though :) Other than that, the idea of judging what systems we could leave open to tempt other powers to undermine for our benefit seems like a mindf*ck of epic proportions and we would have to be delusional to think such a system could actually be managed and controlled. So fortification seems like the only solid option."
AislingDuval,3cny3p,Guiron,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:41:00 2015 UTC,"well by ""over fortifying"" I was talking about fortifying too many systems that would lead to too much CC to spend next turn and then over expansions.   Sorry I wasn't clear enough. Preventing people to fortify over 100% would be great though."
AislingDuval,3cny3p,Gswine,2,Thu Jul 9 18:55:52 2015 UTC,"complete nugget here... literally just signed up with Aisling.  But I have been playing the game actually since PP debuted about.  This sounds about right, and if anything we can learn from ALD.    I don't know much about civil wars, the background meta, or things like that.  I've been too busy making credits to try and become productive.  but this sounds about right to me.  No idea if this actually helps all that much with overhead in Powerplay.  If it does, man oh man, this game has plenty depth if people are willing to look.  I swear I've been going back to my old college coursework in economics and political science since playing this game.  Never have I been so grateful for all those hateful GE classes O7"
AislingDuval,3cny3p,gnwthrone,2,Thu Jul 9 12:32:13 2015 UTC,"We need to do a lot of things   Flip systems to make them provide as much CC as possible Work against our merit grinders to minimize the damage they can do. We can do this by getting a better system (Ienpalang/Beker) or by not fortifying their poorly captured systems. Fortifying wisely. Allowing some CC bleed may be necessary. Smartly expanding and allowing for some -CC style expansions. Dumb, I know, but we have to hit that balance of available CC not netting us 10 systems per week."
AislingDuval,3cny3p,Gswine,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:00:16 2015 UTC,I disagree with your two last points. I understand the thought behind it but any strategy letting some CC bleed will get us into more trouble.  Basically every strategy leading to more upkeep and overhead costs is dangerous.
AislingDuval,3cny3p,CMDRnooc,2,Thu Jul 9 15:09:49 2015 UTC,"I think there is a case for using the Ienpalang method (that's a thing now) to reduce the bad systems entering the list, it would be better if we could stage these ourselves rather than have to react to the merit grinders each turn but it's something.   @Guiron I get the idea of trying to finely balance some CC bleed with effective expansion but the headache of lack of control is going to be compounded by any act of undermining of a Control system. If we balance without enough of a margin the undermining of one or two systems out of a list of 30 - 40+ only helps our enemies hurt us with little to no effort.  We could actually have a method that could allow us to group three or four systems in the same radius ending up with only one. There are factors that will work against us but even the biggest problem in prep - the mindless grinders - would have to get actively organised in 5 or 6 systems to curtail us - I don't think we have seen them moving on that scale recently.    Personally I think turn 4 was a Powerhouse of a turn for us. Very much a high point of cooperative motion juxtaposed the very next turn with a sense of belligerent discord and active separation. I can see where the effects of some actions in the Fourth actually bled through to the fifth    With FD changing the ground rules as we go, maybe one of the things we could do for the factions benefit is make an effort to get back on the same page while the simulation settles. I ask that anyone getting heated by my comment understand I am not taking a side here or pointing at anyone. I just think we didn't have it all together last turn."
AislingDuval,3cny3p,Pantegana,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:33:38 2015 UTC,"Actually negative potential CC systems are systems that exploit a low number of other systems. And since overhead ties well with the number of exploited systems, we can use those negative systems if we want more control systems with minimal impact to overhead. Though the advantages of doing so will only appear once turmoil actually sets in."

AislingDuval,3cnkr8,CMDRnooc,0,Thu Jul 9 11:11:31 2015 UTC,It's not the first time I read this and I don't understand why people tend to think fortifying could be a reason for turmoil.  Fortifying reduces upkeep costs. What could be wrong with reducing upkeep costs ? without fortifying they would have an even bigger CC deficit.  I think they just expanded badly. Expanding in the best systems is key here.  Fortification strategy can only reduce or improve upkeep costs. It can't be a cause for turmoil.
AislingDuval,3cnkr8,DildoTuft,0,Thu Jul 9 13:16:00 2015 UTC,"It was the misallocation of their limited resources that they observe as a cause, and it is clear that other variables can drastically affect the range of possible outcomes.  CC alone does not appear to be the answer, so,  as I tried to convey, I am awaiting more information."

AislingDuval,3cokuo,DildoTuft,2,Thu Jul 9 14:56:06 2015 UTC,"But all in all ALD played well   We will have to disagree on this. Yes I am aware that you cannot control what people are going to prepare/expand/fortify/undermine, every power witnesses these unwanted systems that still get pushed so even if this is not something that they wanted, they still have expanded all the systems but one that could be expanded. This is not playing well and it only accelerated their downfall this week.  Overheads and turmoil are required. They need to be refined, that's a given, but they are required mechanics to prevent the power with the highest numbers to just roflstomp everything. No overheads, no turmoil and we might as well all join ALD right now."
AislingDuval,3cokuo,DLM4ever,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:10:50 2015 UTC,they still have all expanded all the systems but one.   Unfortunately there is no way to prevent that.   Turmoil may be required but not as a reward for being a good power. And for now because of the expansion mess this is how it is.
AislingDuval,3cokuo,DLM4ever,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:22:17 2015 UTC,"And how does the game sort out what a good power is? It does by compiling numbers, that's all it can do. It doesn't matter if the systems that were expanded last week were unwanted and are the work of merit grinders/idiots/poneys, they were still expanded and that didn't make ALD a good power in the end.  What PP needs before anything is a way to communicate in game (really communicate, not the useless chat system that we have), a way to plan preparation and expansion in game as a community, with the possibility of opposing a veto to an unwanted system if the majority doesn't want it, etc.  Don't blame overheads and turmoil, blame the fact that we have to work around them with no ingame tools to do so.  Besides, wait and see: it is pretty obvious that there is something fishy with ALD. I doubt that this is their right ranking. Even if it they go through some decline, it can't be straight to 10th."

For instance in a system 10 ly away from an empire system, 15 ly from an alliance system, and 20 ly from a Federation system you should be able to be on Alliance and on Empire chat channels.

AislingDuval,3cokuo,Pantegana,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:07:17 2015 UTC,"Frontier has provided no way to manage people, and that is the largest problem. Every week, we battle our merit grinders more and more. There's no incentive for playing PP ""right"" vs grinding merit. They assumed far too much of the average player, provided too much of a reward to grind easily, and generally created a system where very single power is doomed to failure.  It's going to be hard to take it all back, but something needs to be put into place. Number 1, a cap on fortification of 100% needs to be put in NOW.   The other thing I think should happen is that nominations should be used by rank 5 players to nominate a better system within a captured sector to allow people who know what the hell they are doing to shift control and exploit to be more advantageous. Ienpalang/Beker should not be the norm.  Finally, merit decay is a dumb system. It just is. I get they want the grind to be there, but starting to see  how much and how fast it is decaying is really leaving me thinking I would be better off just trading or BH. I really think there should be more merit ""bookmarks"" if you will. At 10k, the lowest you can drop in a week is let's say, to 8k. 8k-5k, etc. You still create a grind, but you don't punish people for being active."
AislingDuval,3cokuo,immakingfx,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:09:06 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more.  First thing they need to do is decaying merits we get from a 100% fortified system.

If we took Sounti, it would have cost us upwards of 16000 tonnes in materials to fortify per week. Hauling that many tonnes 178 ly from Cubeo is a heavy burden to put on our Power.

AislingDuval,3cmu83,koandyu,3,Thu Jul 9 03:19:28 2015 UTC,"I think one of the guys on the ALD forum said is most succinctly: we're like them, but two weeks behind.  We have one of the biggest player factions for sure, and it's reflected in our prep and expansion numbers. We've been expanding at an absolutely monstrous pace, almost a hundred exploited systems each turn since I pledged back in week 2. Our position in space has it's pros and cons for sure. On the one hand, we have a very defensible position, and if any of the other powers want to try and undermine us they have to travel a long way and through other imperial powers. As a result we've managed to have almost complete fortification of our systems for the last few weeks, which then feeds into our expansion. On the other, it has been difficult finding good expansion systems that don't conflict with our neighbors. No matter what though, the mechanics of powerplay mean that we will stop growing and reach our factions 'limit', probably within a few turns.   As for our player base, the best way I can think to describe it is that we're very much a grassroots community. We have quite a few small groups running under Aislings banner, and everyone seems pretty passionate about being here. Everyone I've met so far is incredibly friendly and really getting into the RP aspect of this game, which is really cool, as it adds another layer of fun. It really feels like everyone is working to see our princess ascend the throne and change the empire from within, you know?   That said, I think it's fair to say we aren't the most organized of the powers. We've got some major players within our faction that help direct our efforts, but we probably could do better in uniting the various small factions within our power. The last few weeks we've had some systems that get pushed to the top of our expansion list and no one really knows which group is responsible. Personally, I'd like to see us make a council of the player groups, sort of like what ALD has, so that everyone's interests can be heard. If we can form a more united player group, I see no reason that we can't compete with ALD for the number one spot in powerplay."
AislingDuval,3cmu83,CMDRPedantic,3,Thu Jul 9 04:11:00 2015 UTC,"'it has been difficult finding good expansion systems that don't conflict with our neighbors' It should be noted that the difficulty in 'finding' results from the tendency to only look in our neighbour's direction. We have deliberately and provocatively expanded into the region of space that is claimed or coveted by 4 powers while allowing ALD to wrap around our flank.  Koandyu thinks that's 'smart' I think it is wasteful, grossly inefficient, Shopkeeper's avarice and Schoolboy's bravado dictating Imperial policy to no good effect.  The truth is that there is no shortage of excellent expansion prospects, we are only required to look away from taking systems from our neighbours and concentrate on expanding the Lady's Domain with regard to strategic coherence.  As to us not being the most organised power, I fully agree."
AislingDuval,3cmu83,CMDRnooc,7,Thu Jul 9 05:47:29 2015 UTC,"Seconded.  Given the upper limit, we should organise our space for max CC efficiency, not aggression.

Yep, lots of shield stripping power and actually not bad vs hull/modules.. not as good as kinetics ofc, but the pros outweigh the cons on this case for me. And a lot of enemies do tend to disengage when their shields drop, not always the case but they seem to work fine in the cases they do fight to the death.  Though I may be a bit biased as I've always been a bit fond of energy weapons, and think (multi)cannons feel wrong on a Gutamaya ship hehe  Note: The setup is very hard on the capacitor, probably the limit if not a little over what I'd be willing to accept, but it seemed to work the way I use them."

But I did come to my conclusion after testing both in combat, and in the fights (and probably more to do with the way I was using them) the bursts showed to work better for me.  Thankfully the Courier has lots of spare power... though the capacitor drain is still bad.. at least the bursts sound kinda cool (to me anyway)"
AislingDuval,3cmgys,AppleLion,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:56:52 2015 UTC,"According to updated charts past version 1.2.06, burst provide around 20% less damage per second than beams, WHILE at the same time they're around 30% more effective in terms of power used.  Effectively this means that if you're caring about your energy capacitor SYS/ENG/WEP and switching a lot (which is a must due to fact that shields are very effective only in 3.5 and 4.0 PIPS), results in Bursts being best energy spent (sic!) per damage made weapon currently.  Of course, if you're fighting against clueless NPC, and no energy shifting occurs, than pure damage per second is fine (here beams win), and in addition only if your ship is not power deficient.  So no, you're not right :-)"

AislingDuval,3cmgys,rdslw,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:52:27 2015 UTC,"Whats 3.5 Pips? So Pulse does the less damage, but is very power effecient, Beams do the most damage but drain energy banks fast, and burst has decent damage and drain medium power?  thx"
AislingDuval,3cmgys,StormBeforeDawn,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:23:45 2015 UTC,"you can allocate energy to either SYS ENG and WEP capacitor, each with 0.5 allotment between 0 and 4.  As to the other questions, (more less) it's like you described."
AislingDuval,3cmgys,rdslw,0,Sat Jul 11 08:17:12 2015 UTC,Pulse is better DPE than burst. End of story. No idea why you are comparing to beams.
AislingDuval,3cmgys,Pantegana,2,Thu Jul 9 14:37:33 2015 UTC,"Nah my friend, cause Pulse create much less damage (than Burst and Beam) per second, that it's simply too slow, cause our power distributors produce much more energy than needed by Pulses, yet not enough to stock evth in Burst/Beam (which are close to each other but on other part of spectrum comparing to Pulses). Equilibrium is at burst. Mistake you're making is you're concentrating on single element DPS or DPE, while this is not the case simply due to the pips management management and distributor capacity.  Here is data: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=140240  If you don't get the story, let me use automobile analogy:   yes you can have ultra efficient car, but it must to move at 30km/h (your pulses) and have 1000km range yes you can have your nitropowered monster moving at 300km/h but with range 50km (beams) AND YOU CAN have sweet spot car with 240 km/h, and 400km range (burst)   There is also HULL story, which stats (hull damage by thermal weapons) was changed in may, which you're further unaware, but let me leave this knowledge to me.  Anyway, I'm doing myself and my PvP friends disservice, educating you. I'll prefer to educate you in the space. Hard."

AislingDuval,3cmgys,StormBeforeDawn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:13:49 2015 UTC,"Not worth it on smaller ships, imho. Courier is all about agility and speed and she has VERY good shields as it is. If you need four boosters to survive, you're doíng something wrong. XD As for the Prismatic. It's 20 percent stronger than ""normal"" shield of the same class and grade and it is 50 percent heavier with insane power consumption. The normal shield plus one A0 Shield booster is still a better choice. Prismatic makes sense on a big ship where you have plenty of free power and have the best shield plus full set of boosters and STILL want twenty percent more. Keep your Courier light and agile. ;) EDIT: But if you're all about looks, go for it. It's green. With cool effects. So you impress enemies before you die :p"
AislingDuval,3cmgys,GriM_AoD,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:41:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks. That makes sense. I might just give the prismatic shields a skip then. I'm not using my Courier as a dedicated combat ship anyway, just as a ship for running missions which might have to fight off the occasional interdictor."
AislingDuval,3cmgys,seedeero,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:48:27 2015 UTC,with the power being flat % increase it's actually better on a small ship that isn't power starved. I cannot fit the pris shield on my annie and end up with more shields even with an A8 plant.
AislingDuval,3cmgys,GriM_AoD,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:49:49 2015 UTC,"Whilst generally I would agree, I think the Courier is an exception due to it's plentiful supply of power. I personally haven't noticed a hit on it's agility since upgrading. And even with just two boosters like my build the PSG adds about 27% to the total strength, assuming it increases the base value by 20% like is generally believed."

Maybe once he feels like survival isn't such a struggle, he'll soften up a bit more and follow the rules. Til then, someone has to do the dirty work in this corner of the galaxy..."
AislingDuval,3chybe,astrologic_death,3,Thu Jul 9 16:08:33 2015 UTC,"As an old(ancient) commander who cut his teeth piloting a Cobra Mk III out of Lave back in 1984 I didn't really have any allegiance to anyone but myself and my credit account and would do nefarious things to ensure that both of those things survived and prospered, not even the incursions of the Thargoids could sway my opinion  much it was always me against them.  Some years later not really paying attention to the ongoing conflicts and politics of the Empire and that upstart Alliance coming to their own, I was still out for myself but then I heard about this fancy new vessel made by Gutamaya for the Imperial navy and had an encounter with one in the worst way as the beast nearly cut me down before I could jump away into hyperspace.  For those not knowing it was the Imperial Courier at the time, and i was in love and selfish me had to have one. I wish they still made them like they used to  Regardless this meant going down to Imperial space and earning them which having spent most of my time in the federation doing the old Sol <--> barnard star loop I figured it would be a nice adventure and a chance to visit my old stomping grounds around Lave and Diso.  To say the least Imperial culture and slavery was a shock to me not that I had not scooped up many a pirate in their pods thinking I was easy prey and (cough) forcefully enlisted them into the ranks of the black market slave trade in fed-space but how open it was in imperial space was an eye opener but there was a certain order to it and it was regulated by strict laws.  Not letting that sway me I began my work among the Empire to prove that I was worthy of one of Gutamaya's works of art.   I did all manner of mission hauling this, carrying important passengers here and there I cannot recall where the months went but there it was within my reach as I browsed the shipyard my account fat with credits and the sales representative eager to give such a respected merchant a tour of what was to become my new home a pristine Imperial Courier.  I selected all the modules and options I wanted on her and was soon blasting out of the dock the unmistakable and distinct hum of her engines and that overly engineered power plant that always gave you asked of it and was ready for more.  To say I was impressed is truly and understatement and  I had a greater appreciation for the empire.  Needless to say I ended up staying in Imperial space and over the years I think I've grown soft or something.  I remember when the Princess was born there was a grand celebration, and I'd always seen her growing up in the galnet media feeds but it wasn't until recently until she caught my attention with all this business of Emperor Duval supposedly dying and murmurs of a successor not being clear (I'd never though I'd see this day)  Her outspoken messages reminded me of that time when I first came to The Empire and I've always know the way things are was wrong but they didn't affect me directly but I realized that I have been part of the problem for too long and I want to help be part of the solution.  Combining this with the corruption so evident in The Federation these days we cannot afford to see our beloved empire grow weak and divided over an ideology that has been a point of contention with the citizens of the galaxy for so long.  It is bigger than all of us and I pledged myself to stand behind Princess Aisling just as many of you have in hopes of showing that there is a better way.  may her grace shine upon us all"
AislingDuval,3chybe,bryanofphoenix,3,Wed Jul 8 17:06:56 2015 UTC,I wanted to part of the Empire but I cannot abide slavery. That left only the Princess as a good fit for me.
AislingDuval,3chybe,BAScalf,4,Wed Jul 8 20:40:46 2015 UTC,"That's sorta what happened to me too.  Just prior to power play i had switched to the empire. Before, I was a Fed, but things started getting really bad. I decided to get far away from Fed territory and grind rep for a clipper. I didn't think i was going to stay with the Empire.   Conveniently around that time Princess Aisling decided she wanted to build her personal clipper fleet and i was there to help. I got my discounted clipper for helping which really made me like her a lot more than the other imperial figures. When the Feds killed those 9,322 innocent people i knew i could never go back. I decided to stick with the Princess, because she wasn't like the rest of the Empire. She's more progressive and trying to make the Empire a better place for everyone.  Bask in His glory. o7"
AislingDuval,3chybe,Zerohax,2,Wed Jul 8 02:10:59 2015 UTC,"Always been drawn to the Empire, and as I was really finding my feet in the game I was doing CGs for both the princesses. So as powerplay approached I pretty much knew who I'd pledge to, as a through and through Imperial, it was always between the two princesses and after some thought I decided the my strength was better placed with the people's princess. That she turned out to be easy on the eyes was just a little bonus.  Funny thing is, I'm not totally against Imperial Slavery (in the sense of it being like indentured servitude). But seeing Torval/Patreus and reading up only highlighted how it could and was most likely is being abused, which is why at the very least Aisling could at least bring proper control/regulation over it and more automation is never a bad thing.  I do believe (and hope) that she's a lot more canny than she lets on... but should the worst come to be and she is just a ditsy princess, I shall remain and still carry out my duty of protection, she is still a princess of the Duvals and it's my honour to be able to be her sword and shield.  tl;dr - A toss up between the two princesses... reasons + RP... went with Aisling."

First I learned she opposed slavery which made me go wtf, but that fit well with my rp and my character, so I was like noice. Then I hear that Aislings Angels is actually a guild and not something made up by FD, so I join those. Then I read a bit more about politics and basically over time I am more and more happy that I pledged to the kawai space princess.

AislingDuval,3chybe,KyokoLioness,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:46:17 2015 UTC,As I wandered the endless expanses of human controlled space I became disillusioned with all three major factions and all the independents seemed too weak and disjointed to possibly make a real difference (for better or worse) in the galaxy. I made my way around the border systems between Empire and Fed space doing various missions and taking advantage of various different minor conflicts to start working my way up in the galaxy. An old contact of mine tipped me off to an extremely profitable trade rout in Imperial space and I decided to take advantage of it. Only problem was that  this trade rout was based purely around the slave trade. After running the rout enough to make some serious profit I couldn't bring myself to keep up the trade and drifted out to the very edges of Imperial space in the search of a greater calling. When I read about the cause supported by Aisling I knew I had to join up and offer my talents in combat and cargo transport to the glorious cause of our Princess. Hopefully we can make an actual difference in the galaxy and finally set the Empire onto the moral high ground that will be the torch in the darkness for Human Civilization going foward.

Now I've wondered about slapping them on a cobra, as the smallest ship you would dare to put them on, but I feel they're just too heavy and would go over the max tonnage limit making it a moot point. Personally I feel if we're going to grind to try and get them, they should be at least a little more accessible."

AislingDuval,3ch7vg,highlightshadow,2,Wed Jul 8 10:28:00 2015 UTC,My understanding is that the base values for the prismatic shields are exactly 1.2 times the base values for standard shields - which are indicated in the following table:- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xq2fmxhjfNiwtR2fBR1MAZrwEcjFudSuSjTOLwfcqlM/pubhtml

The people who use them mostly don't care whether they go to expansion or not.  Ac Yax Baru is different.  Probably, someone misguidedly thinks it will be a good gain for Aisling, and has invested effort in supporting it.  They won't want it to miss out, which is why it's re-appeared after being ousted yesterday, and why it's now being heavily promoted.  If that's true, then we probably have to accept it.  Trying to promote another system such as Di Yomi now will just mean you evict one of the ""good"" systems such as Conii or one of the HIPs.  You can't keep 5 systems ALL above one whose supporters are determined to keep it in the list.  That's a difficult race to win.  You could try and move everything above Okua'gsa (which is probably a ""dumb"" bad system) and hope it doesn't advance too much, but that's a big job.  It would take 20k points to move the four systems to 1k above Okua'gsa, plus whatever is needed to promote Di Yomi to that position.  And then keeping them there.  Can we stop Ac Yac Baru expanding next turn?  Can we oppose our own expansion?  Would Ac Yac Baru be acceptable if Sounti fails?  Do we not bother and assume it will be one of the first systems to Turmoil?  It's a problem.  Remember that the fortification materials have to be carried all the way from Cubeo, which for anything over about 100 Ly means a re-fueling stop en route."
AislingDuval,3cfd20,Kryfield,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:01:38 2015 UTC,"It would be very difficult to get Okua'gsa out of the list. First off we'd have to push 5 systems above it, the 5th not being in the list yet.  The preparation values for the bottom 5 including Ac Yax Baru have been very close to each other the past few days which makes pushing it out relatively easy if we're coordinated enough. And coordination is the advantage we have over uninformed players acting on instinct."
AislingDuval,3cfd20,Gswine,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:30:31 2015 UTC,"(Edit, cause bad start)  You might get more play from the Ac Yax Baru situation just by saying it's one for missing this week as it could be an overstretch on our resources but it's inclusion will be revised at some point.   It's actually a very good system taking us around from Kalana and keeping an eye on any creep from Hudson. It has many stations most with large pads, a relativity large population and it does not cut into other systems, either our own or any other powers. This may not be the case in future turns.  If we are to question moves to prep this turn then just look at Beker, Ienpalang and now Guuguyani.   We hope that Ienpalang will cancel out Beker (only if it stops being prepped, last I looked it was racing towards Ienpalang's 36,000) but then there were also calls for Guuguyani's prepping. Fine, I thought, I'm sure with all this noise someone knows what their doing. Then it appears on the map and it's 15ly radius intersects substantially with Ienpalang's.   I don't know.  Anyway, Ac Yax Baru had fallen out of the list before I quit last night. If it's back I guess other people arn't too sure about the reasoning behind others decisions right now."
AislingDuval,3cfd20,Kryfield,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:05:50 2015 UTC,It's a good system but a horrible one to maintain. Kelin Samba is good for all the uses you pointed out. The three forward K systems should be enough. The expenses from those three are under 50k tonnes in cargo.  Ienpalang and Guuguyani decisions are based on trading availability rather than CC profit  Ienpalang is steadily +10k from Beker and we're keeping it that way.

Looks like there are commanders out there not convinced that we might not afford the fortification cost.   My personal opinion is it is not the end of the world if we cannot fortify it. For some reasons, may be because our neighbors are empire, our systems are not undermined as heavy as other factions'. We are the only faction who 100% fortified all our systems since week 4, so do not be too obsessed on having a perfect cycle.

These systems eat into each others radius and will cause problems. I'm not telling you anything you don't know and it's not on Aisling's but should we not call this thing out?   Beker is 24413 at time of posting and it's conceivable that prep from the bottom up could be forced to drop it. If I'm remembering correctly (and I'm not always so sure of that...) Beker was discussed as a way to nullify IENPALANG. That's not going to happen with it at 34000 so lets call that done and refocus if Di Yomi has any  chance of making it on the list."

AislingDuval,3catln,Gswine,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:16:33 2015 UTC,"Yup, looked again at the thread. My point still stands though. Beker needs to stop being prepped and all the others on the list need to now  finish the week at over 25000 (if prepping in Beker does stop) or you will end up with these both becoming expansion systems.   As long as Beker stays the attempt fails. It's not enough to just say Ac Yax Baru out the list.  Has there been anymore info on why Ac Yax Baru has to be dropped?

It will take more than 15k to fortify it costing us that much resources which would otherwise be beneficial elsewhere. We already have 2 systems far from HQ with 2 more incoming. Adding another will just harm our efficiency."

I was wanting to check about any possible non fortifying that might have been decided on. The systems on Control list from Woyo Mina down are still to reach target. There was some rumbling about using non fortification to limit CC spend - hopefully control expansion.  Do we have the all clear to fortify before turns end?

They make good meeting-points from which wings can form and either trade up our assets or go off to do something else.  I and most of my friends are having to finance our powerplaying by other means, and travelling off to other systems eats into time.  Efficiency of our sphere is important, but it seems there is no quick cure on the table for the blind-grinders who are likely to prepare even worse--such as the Beker run, which currently outscores anything showing up on Thrudd or Eddn"

Anyway, its not really important.  What's important is, that next to Guuguyni is the extraction system Bharaba with 2.4 Billion people. This system will become an exploited system, if we make Guuguyni a control system and would create an extremely durable source of palladium within less than 13 ly - an extremely valuable trading route! Also, the vicinity to Torvals systems would allow us to profit from the reduced prices for mined goods in Torvals systems. There is no better trade system I can dream of."

No trade route for CMDRs should have priority over the efficiency of the Lady's Domain. There is always another trade route, another RES, another Conflict; but efficient and cost effective administration of the Domain with access to all commodities at least possible price benefits the Game and its Gamers.  I think that your thinking is short-term gain, not long-term benefit.  My question is whether or not, for efficiency's sake, Industrial Systems are the best to be made Control Systems? The answer is, to the best of my knowledge and in most cases, 'Yes'."

Creating a huge empire with many worthless control systems that offer nothing but high CC? That's what we have done in the past. Congratulations, now we have many control systems that are useless for trading, be it agriculture, terraforming or industry/extraction.  It is stupid to only focus on CC. We also need systems that open profitable trade routes. By preparing Guuguyni, we open a long lasting, very profitable trade route to Bharaba and create a base for trading with Torval systems that offer mined materials at reduced prices. My thinking is long-term, of course. Industrial systems are nice, but every round we are preparing systems with lower CC that offer much less benefits than Guuguyni. Or systems with high CC that dont offer any benefits after preparation. So lets do the right thing and prepare Guuguyni ASAP instead of the next Clido Pi or Beker or worse."

There is no 'one' trade route, there is always another, every bit as attractive just around the next system. It is a big galaxy. And you are whistling in the dark.  Hi Tech systems seem to be about 50ly apart in this sector of space, they are certainly few and far between, a precious commodity in themselves.

Palladium can be sold there for a profit of up to 3,7k cr/ton, plus the profit from the material the traders carry on their way back. Noone will need cheap HT goods."

But we have few high tech systems. I'll make sure to point it out to the PP coordinators as a possibility next turn. In the meantime we'd appreciate if you guys helped the current list of objectives. (It's a bit messy as of this sunday)  Cost of high value goods would currently rise in a high tech system, yes, but it's considered a 'trade bug' that the devs are looking into.

Our main enemy is not Winters or Torval or any of the other powers.  It's Aisling commanders who promote bad systems and give us liabilities rather than assets.  The system best placed to break into the list is Di Yomi (currently about 7k points), but this is an excellent very large population resource system, which we lose if it becomes a Control system.  At 47CC I don't understand why it's above Kauruku (67CC) in the Objectives list.  Or why it's in the Objectives list at all.  Kauruku would be my choice to evict Dyestla, but it was only at 1.5k points this morning.  (It's extraction but with limited supply).  Dyestla is steadily progressing.  In addition to bringing in a new contender, we need to keep Conii, HIP 116045, and HIP 105391 above it.  That's possible, but only if a candidate is agreed and an all-out effort is made.  If only some of the effort which has been wasted (even counter-productive) on fortifying systems this week could have been directed to improve the Prep list.  I rescued HIP 116045 yesterday (with only a little help) and it's doing better now that it's in the List.  I don't have the time to spend to attempt another.  Why aren't Dyestla, Ac Yax Baru, Okua'gsa, Beker, HIP 116710 on the Do Not Prepare list?  It might not help much but could prevent a few people unwittingly wasting their effort in the wrong places.  The Objectives list needs to evolve with the changing situation, to concentrate effort where it's needed."

Sounti can be seen as an natural reaction to dangerous Fed expansionist activity in an area of space that is a natural barrier between the Federation and the Empire.   What? We were supposed to just sit and watch Winters move over our heads without worry???  To all those that may be thinking, 'We don't need Sounti, just let it go.' I say look at the current situation with Sengen Sama and San Qin Gu already in Expansion and now the prep list has 7 (7!) out of 10 systems building on the edge of our space   -KANATI, LUGH, BANGWA, FANYIN, MEHUDI, HR 3007, EGERIA-  There is no way that the Sounti incident can be measured as reason for such actions. Every Empire faction is at risk as long as this is allowed to continue and we need to strengthen the line out there or be swarmed.

We could just undermine their threatening expansions. No need to push to Sounti as we already have Kwatsu and Kalana to support the undermining effort if needed"
AislingDuval,3c6tb4,Gswine,3,Sun Jul 5 12:35:29 2015 UTC,"It's just the way the debate has gone on in some threads, I've got some residual resentment to work through :)   Your right, though my point misses your's somewhat.  Many of us didn't even see Sounti coming and as such I understand that the bulk of organised forces within Aisling may distance themselves, even that while Feds crying foul drove the prepping many may now feel that continued whining on their part serves only to goad us into taking on an expansion race we don't actually want.   So maybe your right and it's not worth the effort but I feel that it should be taken through and like it or not that area of space could very well be our line in the sand against aggressive expansion.  Those Borders came to us and I think the prepping of Sounti was actually the moment of realisation of how bad the situation up there had become and the kind of enemy Winters is.  I am fearful, with the kind of angry shouting Winters has been engaging in, while at the same time prepping on a massive scale compared to our Sounti, Kwatsu and Kalana that we might now shy away.   With the way the last turn and this turn are shaping we should throw support on Sounti because it may be the last time we can spare the resources for such an effort. For the next turn is looking very likely that we will, that all the Empire factions will, very much be on the defensive."

AislingDuval,3c6tb4,Rolesium,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:52:15 2015 UTC,It's just a ratio - it doesn't get worse the more they put in. For every 1 merit of effort they put in we have to put in 2.68 merits. And this isn't as bad as it sounds. Our power is larger and typically can quite easily put in 2.68 times the amount of merits - especially as running cargo for prep and expansion seems to be our specialty. This is much as the same as what we did successfully last week for Kwatsu and Kalana.
AislingDuval,3c6tb4,Rolesium,0,Sun Jul 5 18:35:46 2015 UTC,Yes it's a ratio. That's why it gets worst the more they put in.   As you said :  For every 1 merit of effort they put in we have to put in 2.68 merits. for every 1000 we have to put in 2680. for every 10000 we have to put in 26800. And so on. And when they reach 30K and more it's starting to get ugly.  But as I said I'm new to powerplay. If experimented players in our power think this ratio is doable given the circumstances I trust them.
AislingDuval,3c6tb4,Guiron,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:52:20 2015 UTC,But it isn't getting worse - that is the point. You are assuming our efforts and their efforts are one-to-one which they are clearly not.
AislingDuval,3c6tb4,Ryudo54,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:58:04 2015 UTC,Yeah I understood what you meant don't worry.  Imagine if they manage to put 40k or more. This expansion is gonna be a credit sink. Am I imagining something they can't do ?

AislingDuval,3c7idp,Kryfield,3,Sun Jul 5 16:48:44 2015 UTC,"I am fairly certain it is not a bug. Mainly because if the buying price wasn't boosted you could just buy palladium and sell it for 10% higher at the same station.  As such we should try to not expand into any systems with large sources of Palladium (and Gold/Prog Cells/Consumer Tech). Unfortunately, as i'm certain you are aware, the merit grinders looking to make quick credits while grinding merits, seem to want to prepare/expand those very systems... Thus ruining palladium supply after palladium supply...  Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be much we can do about it other than to fight a prep-civil-war with our own merit grinders EVERY SINGLE WEEK to either try to keep them off the list or prep a nearby system within 15LY over them (see Ienpalang vs Beker)."
AislingDuval,3c7idp,Isabelle_Montbarron,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:34:54 2015 UTC,"because if the buying price wasn't boosted you could just buy palladium and sell it for 10% higher at the same station.   The obvious fix would be to increase the price of the High Value goods such as Palladium only in those systems which are NOT producers.  The question is, have Frontier acknowledged that the current behaviour is a bug, or is it working as intended?  The fact that Di Yomi was in this week's Objectives list suggests that the compiler either thinks it will be changed, or he doesn't care about losing Palladium sources."
AislingDuval,3c7idp,CMDRtanthanos,2,Sun Jul 5 17:43:30 2015 UTC,"But that's not the obvious fix, because then the bonus wouldn't actually apply to control systems - it would only apply to control systems conditional upon their economy type. It is also worth noting that other powers who have adjustments to prices specify purchase or sell price increased or decreased. Aisling's bonus does not specify purchase or sell; therefore, given that other powers do, we cannot assume that Fdev simply overlooked the wording.  In that circumstance, it is only reasonable to conclude that both prices being increased was in fact intended and is not a bug.    Now, just because it was intended doesn't mean it won't be changed; however, I don't believe it would be a good idea to assume that it will be."

AislingDuval,3c0cnb,GriM_AoD,2,Fri Jul 3 16:48:59 2015 UTC,"TL;DR  I like it. Lets throw out some other system options before just going with Kalana.  I like this idea a ton!  First of all it should help our own pilots get comfortable with the idea of PVP and hopefully develop skills for the times when they are really needed.  I had little to no PVP experience going into last week and just felt like diving in and seeing how it went -- and had blast doing it.  I can certainly understand why people would be reluctant to do that though.  Secondly I really feel that the more people that are comfortable with the idea of PVP, the less likely they are to want to play solo and instead stick to open, which really will go a long way towards everyone's long-term enjoyment of the game.  As to where the system should be, I kinda think that a location more central would be a better spot for this.  I understand your reasoning for Kalana, but as our future relations with Winters still seem undecided, putting a training grounds for combat in a system that was the recent source of some strife seems like something that would be perceived as another aggressive move by us.  (Of course if that's what the Princess decides then so be it.)  Edit -- Somewhere like CD-72 190 might be good as it has a pretty good outfitter in system to allow people to easily change loadouts for experimentation and is reasonably centrally located."
AislingDuval,3c0cnb,OGfishm0nger,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:12:19 2015 UTC,"hmm, it does make sense to have a place with good outfitting.. say if people want to buy and fit eagle for it or change loadouts. There is a large pop High tech with a station <10Ls very close to Kalana if my memory serves me well.  And I hadn't considered it being perceived as agressive, a good point, was to focused on the defensive aspect."

It is hi-tech, good shipyard and outfitter with good RES surrounding and conflicts are not difficult to find. It is also out of the way, to the rear of the Domain, and so then a sheltered spot whr new CMDRs can move around with confidence. This area too will see action soon enuf, we are being wrapped around thru the Bellaung gap.  Sending novice CMDRs into PvP under-funded, under-skilled, and with entry level ships does not seem like a winning strategy to me.  I agree with the idea and am willing to assist, but, some easy time and easy income as the bank and skills level build, is my suggestion."

My point is that these new CMDRs need an income as well as training opportunities and it has been my experience that hunting bounties and other combat related roles provide the best income at that level.  Your preference is to have the 'school' near the front, mine is for the rear.

AislingDuval,3c0vlf,OnwardFlying,5,Fri Jul 3 19:12:03 2015 UTC,you could always try to find some routes around the objectives and post them yourself.  The officers put a whole lot of effort into the list and finding trade routes.  Unfortunately there are not very many people actually contributing to these kinds of things.  If you want tips on finding routes (iother than searching a trade tool)  just ask me.
AislingDuval,3c0vlf,maxrizk,2,Fri Jul 3 19:37:07 2015 UTC,"At the risk of sounding like an asshole (which I will readily admit I can be at times), why the hell not? Is it unreasonable to expect people to do their own damn legwork instead of asking to be spoonfed by everyone else? If myself and others can spend the time to go look up stuff on Thrudds and other trading tools, or go scout out trade routes in game for ourselves, then I don't see exactly why I shouldn't expect others to do the same.  Helping people is one thing.  Being expected to do the legwork for them so they can be lazy farkwits is another altogether."
AislingDuval,3c0vlf,CMDRtanthanos,2,Fri Jul 3 21:37:22 2015 UTC,"You expect people to prep good systems, but in the same respect to take losses to credits and familiarity. At what gain? There is simply no bonus to a perfect PP playout for the player base.  Be real, here. If you want others to do something so bad, you must make it almost as easy to transition to as simply continuing to do what they have already been doing."
AislingDuval,3c0vlf,CMDRtanthanos,4,Fri Jul 3 21:46:54 2015 UTC,"No, I don't expect people to take a loss to credits (other than the loss you're already going to take from running media already - unless you do multiple trade runs per media run, it doesn't completely make it up).  What I expect is for people to not both insist upon working with powerplay AND at the same time be lazy about doing so. If you want to do powerplay, put in the effort.  If you don't want to put in effort and just wanna do the easiest thing, then don't pledge.  Run the trade routes, take advantage of our increased prices in control systems and increased supply in exploited systems, make money easy and don't do any damage. It's a self perpetuating thing.  You can argue that we have to spoonfeed the grinders because they simply won't put in the effort - but - spoonfeeding them just reinforces that mentality in their mind that they don't NEED to put in any effort themselves, and perpetuates the problem. Yes, in the short term its painful as hell.  But it's like cleaning a house all by yourself because nobody else in the household will help.  The longer you keep doing that, the more it demonstrates to them if they just don't do it, someone else will do it for them. You either keep getting walked on like a doormat and enabling everyone to be lazy fucks, or you do your fair share and let the house get filthy until they get the idea that you're not going to fuckin clean up after them."

Basing work around unrealistic moral values on the will of the casual player to change without incentive, one can simply continue to tell it on the mountain."

Those people you are complaining about, are those who did their share of work and want to see this faction as a whole succeed, not just look at their own profit like others and sabotage it along the way.

Also its large station is 22 Ls from arrival as opposed to Tepitara's 980. (Easy to reach large pads are beloved by all, right?) That distance plus similar-ish economies is why QYC was initially preferred to tepitara.  Thanks for the help and encouraging folks to the constructive spots.

AislingDuval,3bzl7y,Daimon666,2,Fri Jul 3 15:20:22 2015 UTC,"I agreee, too much crap on the list. From a traders point of view, we should really stop preparing extraction systems.

AislingDuval,3bzl7y,Isabelle_Montbarron,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:02:38 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately the problem with why the extraction systems are on our prep list is the apathetic merit grinders who want to make a profit right now (most of whom I assume don't follow the reddit)... as they take PP commodities one way and Palladium straight back to our control systems to pick up more PP commodities. As such it's not particularly easy to stop, but we're hoping it'll slow down once a bunch of people jump ship after getting their shields.  Also as long as Ienpalang is secure (It MUST stay above Beker), I think I'll join the OP in pumping HIP 116045 for a while."

AislingDuval,3bzl7y,AppleBlumpkinator,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:34:30 2015 UTC,That usually won't work because the grinders will prep the extraction system faster than the players can prep the alternative.  It only worked (hopefully) with Beker because only the outposts have extraction.  The starport with large pads is agricultural.
AislingDuval,3bzl7y,CMDR_iFred,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:48:00 2015 UTC,"Correction: none of the outposts have commodities. It's that there is a 4000 LS flight to the extraction stations (all 3 do have large pads). It's that it isn't the most crazy money making merit grinder trip since they have to cruise for a bit, BUT it will almost NEVER run dry of palladium (esp once we exploit it)."

AislingDuval,3c1amm,DildoTuft,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:10:14 2015 UTC,I just look at what each power is currently doing.  Under fortify and expansion it will show you how each system is currently fairing and any opposition.  I've only been playing for half a week so there might be a different way but I racked up a good amount of merits crossing over into fed space around Sounti last night.
AislingDuval,3c1amm,sublime81,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:35:49 2015 UTC,"Well you're right, looking in the powerplay panel is the easy way to do it. But it's kind of a lonewolf way. And I'm not even sure I don't mess with some others allied plans when I do it. That's why I wonder if some fighters are actually doing something more structured, playing in groups and in coordination with other players doing preparation/expansion/control."
AislingDuval,3c1amm,sublime81,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:50:59 2015 UTC,I would look into joining a clan/group.

AislingDuval,3c0wbr,AppleBlumpkinator,2,Fri Jul 3 20:30:59 2015 UTC,"Although HIP 116045 is ""Extraction"", it's low population and low supply, so it's not useful for a trade route.  Certainly in this case its use as a Control system greatly outweighs its loss as a palladium source."
AislingDuval,3bxz3g,Rolesium,2,Fri Jul 3 02:11:18 2015 UTC,"This formula appears to be the correct one. If anyone wants to plan out how their merit gain will go, you can use my spreadsheet.  Just put the merits you earned/plan to earn for free in the left column and it calculates how much you need to fast-track to keep rank or hit the next rank. Enter how many you fast tracked/plan to and it will calculate how much you spent vs how much you earn back.  Note: If you didn't start on the first week, skip the first line, or use the second sheet on the bottom. (there was a bonus if you started on the first week.)"

AislingDuval,3bxz3g,Azmondar,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:12:00 2015 UTC,As you get higher in rank you will get more media/contracts/materials per 30min.

AislingDuval,3bw7se,liquidjems,4,Thu Jul 2 19:38:22 2015 UTC,"Only thing I'd recommend changing  - Let's give people an undermining target for Winters.  One, it gives the combat focused guys something to do. Two, it can pull some of the heat off of other spots. And three, it looks like per the other thread, we are pretty comfortable taking the war to Winters.  We organize everything else, I think it's time that we start at least designating a target for undermining and giving that direction. Sengen Sama looks pretty well positioned with Kwatsu. It's already starting to heat up, with a 35% undermined / 27% expanded total.  ALD probably has a lot of undermining they can do this week as they try to minimize everything else. Not sure if they are going to focus on Winters or Hudson, but we might be able to coordinate as an Empire and make some big moves. Hudson doesn't make sense, to me, as undermining is what keeps him from going into turmoil. It's like he's succeeding by failing."

AislingDuval,3bw7se,CMDRAlcubierre,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:52:38 2015 UTC,That is correct. A system that is both fortified and undermined at the end of a cycle is counted as neither – each state cancels out the other.

AislingDuval,3bw7se,Isabelle_Montbarron,2,Sun Jul 5 19:03:06 2015 UTC,HIP 111153 is way better than Beker (the current #10 on the prep list)  Beside that - it is in direct conflict with Ienpalang.  So any prep on Beker is wasted.  Some help prepping HIP 111153 to get it on the in game #10 list is much appreciated!!   Beker need to go though.
AislingDuval,3bw7se,Guiron,3,Thu Jul 2 20:31:27 2015 UTC,"Beker is actually the reason we picked Ienpalang. Beker is one of the largest palladium suppliers in the empire, and had been targeted by our ""wonderful"" horde of apathetic merit grinders last cycle (it was barely kept out of our top 10). Turning it into a control system would RUIN the palladium supply due to the 10% price increase. So it was decided to prep Ienpalang so that Beker would become impossible to ruin (unless we lose Ienpalang)."
AislingDuval,3bw7se,Jpotter145,2,Thu Jul 2 20:52:51 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing about keeping Beker on the top 10 that's sort of sneaky smart. As long as Ianpalang stays higher than Beker, we take that instead of Beker and deny ourselves an expansion. Why is that good? Because we are hurtling headlong into turmoil. It basically wasted a ton of our own prep, but that's actually a good thing."
AislingDuval,3bw7se,Guiron,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:56:49 2015 UTC,I see - glad Ienpalang is #1; the grinders sure are pushing Beker.  With all the prep already HIP 111153 seems to already be a lost cause as it would need to displace Dyestla.  Hope if it is we can consider it next week if things don't turn around.  HIP 111153 is easy money and a GREAT drop for expensive metals as there are a ton of supplies within 1 or two jumps.
AislingDuval,3bw7se,SirMightySmurf,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:22:14 2015 UTC,I am starting to get a really strong suspicion that there's an organized group of players prepping based on population.

Why this choice?    Two alternatives very near that position are:  Tepitara (Cost 96, Potential 42)  Industrial, so it will give a high Palladium and Gold buy price.  Tailgan (Cost 106, Potential 54)  Another Extraction but with a higher potential CC.  Probably Platform (no large pads), tiny population so low supply, so the increase in Pd/Au costs isn't much of a loss.  Qi Yun Cech only had about 40 prep points an hour ago, but we'll need some targets to try and remove junk (Dakshmandi, Dyestla, Okua'gsa ?) from our prep list. Perhaps either of these two alternatives would be better than Qi Yun Cech?  And/Or, as mentioned above, HIP 111153 (Cost 86, Potential 42) is an Industrial (which is good) with a similar potential and in a good position.

And once bad systems are on the list, players that do understand how prepping works are discouraged to invest in systems that may never make in on the list.

We didn't make it two weeks ago (more or less deliberately in favor of Cailli). But we didn't make it last week either, because once it was out of the top 10 and even fell 10k or 15k behind the 10th system, there was no point trying to prep.

AislingDuval,3bw7se,rdslw,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:01:51 2015 UTC,"BUT WE WANT hightech systems having inflating (higher) price, because we're controlling them. We can then sell palladium there.  It does not make sense to increase the price (which is low at start) at extraction systems which are PRODUCING palladium and we're buying it there (low cost for buy).  It does not make sense to me, what you're saying."

You don't want to have higher price for goods youd like to buy at hitech systems (e.g. ProCell) once they're control ones 2. I'm telling that it's better to have hitech as control, as this will increase palladium price, so we can sell it there.  In any case what I also said is that making extraction as control is BAD, as this will increase palladium price at which, we're buying it there.  Palladium case is slightly more important because powerplay boost is percentage one, and palladium price is higher."

Its 80 trips with a cargo space of 230 and if you have deep pockets lol. But in all if everyone did fast track for this system. It would be 180000000 credits to do so. and that would grant it place 10 on prep board.  but all would change at the time of this post. Its just numbers to go by.

AislingDuval,3bw7se,Limasa,0,Thu Jul 9 05:19:10 2015 UTC,"Hello, I'm new to powerplay so maybe someone can explain to me why we are focusing on expansions so much right now ?  When this cycle began most people agreed that we were expanding a lot. Probably too quickly. So the first idea was to focus on fortifying to avoid turmoil risk.  fortifying to avoid turmoil sounds perfectly clear in terms of game mechanics.  I understand we have to take care of preparation and expansion to control where we really want to expand. But when the list is clean we should refocus on control! Or don't we risk turmoil anymore ?  Our control page looks really weak to me right now. Only 5 systems are done over 28.  I read someone stating that if we risk turmoil we have to not fortify. I understand his explanation but it seems completely against the game mechanics to me. continue over expanding to avoid turmoil sounds totally wrong.  I strongly believe we should refocus on fortifying when our preparation list looks fine. And we shouldn't wait too long. 28 systems with some very expensive ones is a lot of work."
AislingDuval,3bw7se,DildoTuft,0,Sat Jul 4 10:52:21 2015 UTC,"Fortifying everything isn't really viable anymore after FD massively increased the cost. Rather it should be done in response to undermining, which we haven't really seen any of yet."
AislingDuval,3bw7se,SirMightySmurf,2,Sun Jul 5 14:20:40 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate please ?  I see no benefit to not fortify systems and think that fortification should always remain a priority.  Not fortifying to decrease CC number next turn looks like a big risk.
AislingDuval,3bw7se,Kryfield,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:35:38 2015 UTC,The triggers (and thus the cost if fast tracking) were increased by 500% recently. I'm not sure there's hours enough in a day to fortify everything even if we wanted to.

AislingDuval,3bx0ui,Guiron,2,Thu Jul 2 21:14:25 2015 UTC,An alternative way to achieve the Beker / Ienpalang scenario is to prep systems in conflicting radius of other powers' own prepping efforts. They will then be forced to beat the prep of our systems - thereby reducing our expansion list - but at the same time we waste their resources that could be spent elsewhere. Some of the other powers have successful preps for only a few thousand merits - we could afford to make them work a bit harder.

AislingDuval,3bx0ui,Isabelle_Montbarron,2,Thu Jul 2 21:44:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly this is kind of what I see happening once we hit turmoil (with lots of sarcasm regarding merit grinders). =)     week 1 of turmoil:  Merit grinders are saddened by the inability to prepare the most worthless systems nearby, and not being able to ruin even more trade routes. Because they can't prepare terribad systems, they instead ALL expand the previous weeks terribad preparations. This increases our overhead and forces a 2nd week of turmoil.     Week 2 of turmoil:  Sweet, sweet justice! Merit grinders can't prepare terribad systems and they cant expand terribad systems (no systems prepared last week), so if they want to continue merit grinding the have to actually do something that is actually useful (or at least not harmful) as all they can do at this point is fortify and undermine/oppose. Poor merit grinders. I might almost cry tears of joy. As long as we fortify most of our systems this week, and don't get undermined too heavily we should be able to get out of turmoil for next week."

AislingDuval,3bx0ui,Isabelle_Montbarron,2,Thu Jul 2 21:43:25 2015 UTC,At least that doesn't hurt us. I also am hoping a sizable number of the grinders decide to leave after they get their shields.

AislingDuval,3bx0ui,FAAmecanic,2,Fri Jul 3 14:45:09 2015 UTC,"Ok, here is a thought, What if we have to do more then just prep, expand and fortify. I think FD thru Galnet gave us a hint of what we need to do.  We need to keep the people within our border happy and peaceful and be productive.   For example both Kalana and Kwatsu  have system factions under lockdown.  Per Galnet we need to do bounty hunting in these systems.  Maybe CC income and overhead is not fix but depends on the boom and bust of the systems.  I am not sure if this part of the game dynamic or not,  it is just a thought I have."

Also...and this worked in a similar fasion another game I played for YEARS (World War 2 Online)... I wish they would allow a faction to vote for a ""General"" or ""leader"" each cycle, and that leader has the ability to shut down any system that we shouldn't be prepping or expanding.     Would be a big headache for the player that is acting ""General"" ...but at least then someone the community chooses is running the strategy."

AislingDuval,3butwf,EpicFailCookie,7,Thu Jul 2 15:08:38 2015 UTC,"So let me just post about this and why we aren't necessarily going to be continuing discussions of a peace treaty or an Alliance with the leadership/Coordinators of Felicia Winters. For starters, we have been fairly pacifistic since the start of Power Play, we have had our fair share in conflicts with our imperial factions but it was always something we could work out, and this is apparently as to how we've done things up to this date.  Now comes the Federation, who shot at us first for relationships even though it would have looked bad for both sides, then brushed off the fact I told them ""No, we can't do that"" and angrily push out more aggressive talks for alliances, then immediately shoots at us the moment we have to branch out of our corner or essentially die off, but still have the audacity to come at us with open and warm hearts with the thoughts of an Alliance?   No, I'm going to take the high road and just say if they want to fight us, let them fight us. We'll have the support of the Imperials backing us up. I honestly prefer to avoid conflict as much as possible, and turning our backs and essentially make enemies of the other Imperials isn't a wise investment. We have been avoiding conflict as much as possible, and to be totally frank, we've been leaving most of the powers alone unless they directly come into problems with us.  Edit: The Relationships we have with our own Imperial Powers are more important and worth preserving than to align ourselves with another Power that clearly is doing this for their own benefit.  Edit2: I honestly prefer a relationship with other Powers that won't come and demand such ludicrous and forceful Alliances.  Edit3: I believe continuing our pacifistic endeavors is more suited to our playstyles anyways, we leave them alone and if they come to fight us, we'll fight back. Whatever happens with Sounti, happens and we move on to the next."
AislingDuval,3butwf,MajorLegend,2,Thu Jul 2 16:39:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think its worthwhile having conversations with the winters group, we will let their actions decide whether they want to fight us on the border or not.  When blackfox posted in our subreddit he made it very clear that he believed the current territory to be federal and not imperial and we argue otherwise. To us Kalana and Kwatsu are important because we cannot expand against our own. At this very moment we have a pretty firm alliance with Arrisa's Legion.  As for Sounti. I think our borders end at Kalana and Kwatsu, there is no reason to have Sounti as we never even wanted it in the first place. Sounti was the action of a small group of players.  So the conclusion is we are not at war with winters, but we will defend Kalana and Kwatsu as we have done in the last cycle."

I do not think Winters people have anything warm and fuzzy for us in the slightest, but enough of them are willing to acknowledge how costly war is for them, and some of them could be swayed if they knew Sounti was a misunderstanding.  So we can definitely not say that an alliance is anywhere on the table with Winters, or any Fed.  But an armistice or a truce is something that we can manage.  By the time the Emperor wakes up, I want Aisling Duval to be the #1 faction.  If we have truces in place with the Feds, they will leave us alone and we can get even bigger than ALD got before she started collapsing.  That just might encourage his Imperial Highness to support Aisling's claim to the throne over ALD."

Er .. um .. we accidently selected a system on your border within 30 seconds of the weekly rollover, and prepped it non-stop all week. Those damn merit farmers, always up to no good. The 105ly route from Woyo Mina to Sounti must just have been the easiest way to make merits last week. Sorry, we just have no control over those damn perky merit farmers. Believe us Winters!"

LOL  So last week your excuse for continuing to prepare a system that was not intended to be an objective was that it was too late, it was already nicely prepped so you might as well finish what was started... And this week that's the same excuse: oh well the system made it to the expansion phase so why not expand it?  Last week you could have included in your weekly objectives a request to stop preparing Sounti (what anyone would have done if it had been a real ""misunderstanding"") but you haven't done it. This week you could have asked to stop expanding there but you are not doing it. That makes your intent very clear.  And you still want us to believe that Sounti was a mistake, that it was never a target? How freakin' dumb do you think we are? It has always been a hidden objective, hidden from your weekly report to keep the face of the good guys. You maybe fool the other powers with your talk of peace but you certainly don't fool us at Winters. You have opened the hostility by claiming this system and you still blame us... Amazing.  If you want to treat with someone, honesty is the first step to be taken seriously. As long as you won't be honest about your intents or recognize that you are the aggressors, you can't hope for any peaceful relations with your fed neighbour."
AislingDuval,3butwf,oscarjhn,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:33:30 2015 UTC,"If you examine the polls, you can obviously see that I asked specifically if people would be willing to trade Sounti for peace.  Around half of the people who don't want Sounti, don't want it because of logistics.  The rest of them agree with me.  I started this nice and early, plenty of time to vote before we talk, we act in good faith, as we so promised.  And the poll was started at the beginning of the cycle, so there's plenty of time to figure out the details.  So please be quiet now and go wander back over to r/EliteWinters  Thank you, phew."

AislingDuval,3butwf,oscarjhn,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:45:15 2015 UTC,"Let me just be totally frank here, if Power Play actually gave the Coordinated players the proper tools to coordinate and prevent shit like this from happening, believe me, we would have been the first to open communication lines to the other powers that aren't imperial. But we don't and it's almost as if Frontier wanted conflict to arise from that fact.  We only took two systems, Kalana and Kwatsu which were AWAY FROM YOUR BORDERS. We did this purposefully to take advantage of not only trade routes, but systems we could use to escape being cornered by Torval and Arissa. If anything, these two systems were on top of Arissa's systems and we took it because it was either that, or be forced into a corner and make things even more difficult to prep/fortify/control.  I don't entirely understand the whole situation with Sounti was, but it was something my guys did not press for, nor was it we want. It seemed to have been a problem of the subreddit. Fuck, we even told your guys ""Hey, we don't want this system, please beat us in the Prep thing and get it out of there"".  Almost always, the problems we've faced TO DATE with other Powers, comes from the inability of proper means of communication in-game or out of it. I have spoken to your leaders in the past regarding relations of the sort; but when shit like this comes out of the woodwork after talking to them in an Out Of Context Summit, it really boggles the mind.  I solemnly wish we had the tools, to coordinate and work with other powers better, but until then, we have to lookout for ourselves first before we can promise or keep any sort of relationship clean and stable.  Edit: Like from what I can tell, we've been fairly open and friendly to all the powers we've can. (Aside from Arissa's, but we're working on our relationship) It really isn't that we don't want to work with you, it's that given the tools of Power Play and given our previous encounters with you guys, you really don't give us much of a choice to choose which side of the fence to really be on."

However, I have a hard time believing you are not directly targeting Winter. Even without Sounti, Kwatsu and Kalana are still pretty suspicious to us.  Not to mention the reaction of many of your members when we finally noticed Sounti. You guys have wings shooting transports and traders in Rhea, you had multiple wings in Simyr last night, and you have members playing the name and shame game with baseless accusations in your Reddit.  Like I said, I understand you cannot communicate with, or even control members of your Power, but I fear any diplomatic effort made will simply be undermined by your hostile player base."
AislingDuval,3butwf,DLM4ever,3,Thu Jul 2 18:07:06 2015 UTC,"If only we had the tools friend, and even said that, the Federation's aggressiveness towards the other Imperial factions leave us in a position that we either have to fight you or just cut off any potential Relations. We chose cut off relationships, but fight back if you try to attack us.  Believe what you will with that, if any of our leaders had any ill intentions against another Power, we would have put them on our list for coordinated attacks on our Objectives list. (Fun fact: We never really had anyone we had beef with at all.)  Even saying that, the only real ""aggressive"" stance we had was with He Xingo, and then we stopped when we realized that there was truly neither side could do about it."
AislingDuval,3butwf,Cucco-Master,5,Thu Jul 2 18:16:07 2015 UTC,"Haha you're definitely right in that we will always be aggressive towards the other Imperial Powers, I (and most Winterites) just wish it was A LD and Granny Torval, and not you guys. I guess I can understand how y'all needed an escape route from your fellow Imperials, but to me that's indicative of your awareness that your fellow Imp's definitely don't have any of your interests in mind."
AislingDuval,3butwf,DLM4ever,2,Thu Jul 2 18:26:34 2015 UTC,The primary reason for peace between Winters and Aisling wasn't really one of ideology steeped in lore but rather proximity. When we were far away from each there wasn't the possibility of conflict. Now that we are situated on your border the members of each power will spend their time in skirmishes and battles. The reason for this is simple. Feds hate Imps and vice versa. We are natural enemies. Sure ... we could set up a treaty or ceasefire ... but realistically half our members are just going to kill each other anyway so what would be the point?
AislingDuval,3butwf,Rolesium,0,Thu Jul 2 19:20:06 2015 UTC,"DLM4ever, I do not appreciate in the slightest that you came to this thread to do commenting when this thread is specifically for organizing the polling we were doing, which I promised you that I would do.

AislingDuval,3butwf,Rolesium,-7,Thu Jul 2 18:49:43 2015 UTC,This poll is a farce. As well as your talks since last week. So don't be so worked up about the discussion going on during the poll.  You have always wanted to get your hands on Sounti and this farce is just window dressing because you don't want to appear as possible aggressors to the face of other powers.

AislingDuval,3butwf,Hy3jii,2,Thu Jul 2 20:42:24 2015 UTC,"You have hit a nerve.  We still are the Imperial power least likely to be attacked, because we (try) to play nice with others and Aisling Duval is such an amazing space Kaleesi.  We have a significantly easier time fortifying than non-trade groups, our commanders are rich and dedicated, we have good systems, and we're weeks away from even needing to think about that.  Not to mention, that we will most likely be marching in to fill the void left by ALD, making preservation even easier.  No, a truce with you Winters folks is about building our resources even faster.  If Aisling is #1 when the Emperor wakes up, I think the Imperial line may pass to her.  Which would be the ultimate victory for our power."

But most of them are mad, and they don't trust that we didn't have messing with them in mind (well, that's true for some of us).  But they must have spent thousands of man-hours trying to prevent our expansions, so the hostility is certainly real.  They even borrowed help from Zachary Hudson."

AislingDuval,3butwf,seedeero,7,Fri Jul 3 06:13:34 2015 UTC,"Arguably 3.  We are pinned between the edge of civilised space and Arissa, so need to expand in ways such as to Sounti in order to not be at ALD's mercy down the line.  We are an Empire faction, and ultimately Winters and Hudson aren't. We should be standing united against them, and any peace attempt is a Federation ploy to divide and conquer the Empire. Also, given how the Federation powers have been doing, it'd probably make us the next target once the Federation lose that war."
AislingDuval,3butwf,ju87,4,Thu Jul 2 10:31:33 2015 UTC,"My gut says 3, because we took the system fair and square. Was it maybe a bit of an aggressive/cheeky move? Sure. But it wasn't in their space, and there's still (to the best of my knowledge) disagreement about who moved on the system first - so they can't even claim definitively that we stole it out from under them.  I don't want to start an open conflict with the Federation - I'm not a combat pilot by any stretch, and the potential for increased interdictions on trade runs isn't especially appealing - but I also don't think we should back down just because Winters got her feelings hurt."
AislingDuval,3butwf,CMDR_iFred,5,Thu Jul 2 10:03:25 2015 UTC,"3 please. If these Feds think they can cause us any real trouble, I say bring it on.  Absolutely nothing to do with the amount of time I spend undermining Winters' systems."
AislingDuval,3butwf,FAAmecanic,5,Thu Jul 2 11:11:43 2015 UTC,"3 They fired the first, they could have broke peace with us over Sounti (which I believe was our trespassing), but they had to fight us (pretty much fire on us) in Kalana and Kwatsu.  So shots have been fired, its time for Felicia to realise Aisling/ALD are not to be messed with. So 3  PS and lets face it, this game is becoming boring, a bit of conflict will bring fun to everyone. Sucks that PVP has no effect on the systems though.  As for Sounti - I don't think we have to fight over it as long as have Kalana and Kwatsu. We don't want to enter into the impossible to maintain situation."
AislingDuval,3butwf,Freakazoiden,4,Thu Jul 2 12:42:15 2015 UTC,"I'm going with 3.  We paid the iron price for Sounti, it's ours.  If Winters wants to fight a war they will lose to get it back then so be it."
AislingDuval,3butwf,bryanofphoenix,4,Thu Jul 2 15:23:18 2015 UTC,"Look, while I am in the 3 camp for the reason that we need an enemy to keep down our expansion and basically prove our worth to the Empire, I'm not delusional.  Sounti was on us, guys. Time to accept that. I'm all for it, have no problems with it, loved the move, all of that. But we were the aggressor. It worked out for us, even if it was initially just a feint to buy Kwatsu and Kalana breathing room, but now that we have it? Yeah, I'm all for keeping it.   But let's stop kidding ourselves that we weren't at all to blame and this is just a reaction to the K/K undermining. That said, it's also ok to be the aggressor. That is what PP is all about. You can definitely sit in your space, do nothing to anger anyone, and still lose.   Like I said a few days ago - This type of PP is what ALD, Torval and Patreus have been living since DAY ONE. We got lucky through the first few cycles with flying under the radar, but we have everyone's attention now with 975k of merit prep this cycle. I know a ton of that is merit grinders, but we are doing what we can dealing with that. Either way, the target is there whether we think it should be or not. So time to start acting like a top 5 power and getting into the fight."
AislingDuval,3butwf,TwoGunns,4,Thu Jul 2 23:38:01 2015 UTC,3; I've been happily undermining Winters/Hudson for the last few weeks and cutting down the hour long 150 LY slog is sorely needed.

AislingDuval,3butwf,GriM_AoD,2,Thu Jul 2 11:23:28 2015 UTC,"1) Sounti was aggressive, that cannot be denied. But now Felicia Winters camp wants to talk. They know we have the numbers.

AislingDuval,3butwf,Guiron,2,Thu Jul 2 12:40:39 2015 UTC,"3  We need to shore up our relations with other Empire powers first, but Winters should be number 1 on our hit list (as it should be with any other Empire faction if there is another ...haven't checked the map).

AislingDuval,3butwf,Duanedibly,3,Thu Jul 2 13:51:12 2015 UTC,"3.  As a citizen of the Empire, I have never forgotten our history with the Federation and their desire to control us to take what isn't theirs and bring what is nothing more than slavery under a different guise of political corruption and excessive force.  If anything this should be an eye opener to our brothers and sisters in the empire of the true face of the Federal powers whom fear our message. The citizens of many systems  wish to be guided by the progressive ideals to make a better galaxy free from the oppressors both large and small.  The Likes of Patreus and Lavigny should take this opportunity to show that we the empire despite our differing ideals at our core we stand for the same overall goals."
AislingDuval,3butwf,CMDRtanthanos,3,Thu Jul 2 14:14:32 2015 UTC,1 for sure. When Sounti was only just started to be prepared we got told to stop by Winters then we got told we would not win after that didn't work we got attacked but we won. Winters is scared we should finish what we started and expand Sounti and demand peace if Winter doesn't give it we use Sounti to hit them where it hurts. As the powers expanded they will all be rubbing shoulders Winters has shown her colours so we know we will be at war sooner or later. We have also shown Winters that we have the numbers and dedication to win so that should give her the reason to give us peace.
AislingDuval,3butwf,Cucco-Master,3,Thu Jul 2 14:15:09 2015 UTC,"1 We took Sounti fairly using our time and resources.  If they had wanted it badly enough, they had ample opportunity.  If they want peace, great, but not at a greater sacrifice to ourselves."
AislingDuval,3butwf,Pantegana,3,Thu Jul 2 15:22:22 2015 UTC,"3  I don't think peace talks will result in anything. Outright war should be avoided for now but we should not go for anything more than a ceasefire. I am with some of the other players, we're in a sort of corner and I'd rather we expand on the cost of the Federation than on other empire powers. I don't care about Sounti itself, but we earned it, even if its far away.  In the end, I really don't like the two fed powers and I'd love to stick it up to Winters. Hudson seems to have managed to fuck himself up."

AislingDuval,3butwf,BAScalf,3,Thu Jul 2 22:17:06 2015 UTC,"Sounti was aggressive (expansion) but by no means should its prep have been considered an insult to Winter's camp. It was outside her space, not engulfed by it (unlike He Xingo), and proximity to her space, at least by my measure, isn't enough for a De Jure claim. After they noticed Sounti, did they approach us diplomatically? As far as I know, their response was opposing K and K's expansion. Even then, we pulled through. Sounti is ours, and should be kept so. Now, would I want a war between us? No. We can't afford one at this time. Should we overlook their aggression at K and K? No. I don't think we should make demands, but I also think we shouldn't forget them."
AislingDuval,3butwf,SergeantJezza,2,Thu Jul 2 16:43:28 2015 UTC,3 But only with the provision that we really work to improve Imperial coordination. Winters just seems like the most logical enemy for us. This may sound crazy but we need an enemy as unchecked expansion will kill us faster than anything.
AislingDuval,3butwf,Vaestmannaeyjar,4,Thu Jul 2 16:58:54 2015 UTC,3.  I think winters has nothing to offer and everything to lose. She has enemies on all sides and chose to attack us. I don't think we need many more systems in that area though.

AislingDuval,3butwf,SpiritOfRedemption,3,Thu Jul 2 22:49:05 2015 UTC,"I'm picking 2.  I think that Sounti, while a great system, is going to be difficult to maintain (in the long term) and, in honesty, I would have viewed an incursion like that as aggressive.  It reminds me of what the few ALD supporters are doing in He Xingo.  I would trade it for peace, but only with some incredibly friendly overtures from the Winters camp that were backed up by action."
AislingDuval,3butwf,SpiritOfRedemption,2,Thu Jul 2 09:45:40 2015 UTC,Can we add a 2.25? I don't support expanding to Sounti because it's too far from our space and may contribute to higher overhead and cause us problems.  Peace with the feds (for now) would be nice but I'm not overly concerned with it if it doesn't happen.
AislingDuval,3butwf,RheaAyase,2,Thu Jul 2 10:39:40 2015 UTC,"Giving them Sounti would have been alright last week during the preparation phase, but now it is too late for them. From what I saw, most of us had already given up on the system once the had realised the offensive act and the system had already been moving downward in our top-list. Winter could have easily outprepped it if she had wanted to but instead she decided to fight for it. In this fight we have won the prep race fair and square and Sounti is now rightfully our expansion. There is absolutely no reason for giving up a +136 system (or +125 as it said last week) that is already in its expansion phase."
AislingDuval,3butwf,OnwardFlying,2,Thu Jul 2 10:54:14 2015 UTC,(1) Winters are organizing an alliance with other factions in order to run a massive attack in the heart of the empire. The federation does not know the meaning of honor and respect for any life. Only .cr Some independent mercenaries have already been aquired custom missions for exterminate Empire traders weaker. Necessary prudence.  Nin never deal with federal terrorists. End trasmission.

At last it makes the game more interesting if we have to do something to gain system. But i'm against the expansion to Sounti. It's too far from our base which make's it hard to fortify and it's too close to fed space which makes it too easy to undermine. In short it'll just cost us double -> not worth it. So is it option number 2.5?"
AislingDuval,3butwf,demondownload,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:08:13 2015 UTC,"EDIT: changing my vote to 2.25. Our expansions are completed and I prefer enjoying the fruits of our labour. Yes, Black Fox did march in here, thinking he could order us around, and Winters lost the battle in cycle 4. Many of the fed pilots fought with honour and they've been quite sportsmanlike about the end of the cycle, including Black Fox. However, the situation remains fairly hostile with Sounti being expanded (possibly by the Stars of Duval?). I do not support actively waging war with the Federation on our own. Any warmongering should be done as an Empire. Other than that, we should focus on our hometurf and continue to modernise the Empire. The rest of my post still holds true and I'm leaving the rest as is. What's written is written.  All was quiet around Kwatsu and Kalana mostly, during cycle 3. It was a long haul, but a quiet one. Then next cycle, all hell breaks loose when people start prepping the Sounti system. I was facepalming over that choice. Sure, it is worth a lot of points, but I agree that prepping a system on the borders of Winters space comes across as rather hostile. I've sunk over 100M into Powerplay last week. All of that into Kwatsu and Kalana. Not a single merit into Sounti. Not only was I really not up for prepping yet another system so far from home, I was not interested in hostilities at all. In fact, we Angels had orders not to get involved.  So why do I vote 3? Because of this:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AislingDuval/comments/3b5yp1/sounti_kalana_and_kwatsu/  Yes, we prepped a system on Winters' border and that was hostile. Waltzing into our subreddit and declaring war on not only Sounti, but Kwatsu and Kalana as well, went too far. I worked very hard on Kwatsu to get some breathing space away from the dome of rival imperial powers above us (expanding our bubble slowly would have required us to take orange and red systems) and because it is a lucrative trading hub. I would have loved to invite the Winters supporters to come and trade with us, as long as they keep their hardpoints retracted... They went too far by attacking Kwatsu and Kalana.  I find it amusing that, when reading each power's subreddit, most of the powers seem to be struggling with multiple player groups choosing different goals, merit grinders, and possibly even 5th columning. Yet when a fellow power makes a move, it is deemed a concerted effort and part of a master plan to destroy their way of life. The Angels stated many times that we had no orders or plans for Sounti and that we were not supposed to touch it. Our power did end up touching it. Whether Winters' supporters believe we spoke the truth or not, it doesn't matter. What does matter, based on the effort Winters put into opposing us: if they had left Kwatsu and Kalana alone, we would mostly have left them alone and had they put all that effort into Sounti instead, they would have successfully stopped us. Instead, they decided that we somehow suddenly decided to become another Arissa and have a masterplan to all go to war instead of our rather peaceful trading.  I do not give a damn about the Sounti system and will not be involved with its expansion or even fortification, should that come to pass. I do give a damn about Kwatsu and Kalana and I'm not open to peace talks while their spokespeople come to us and tell us what we are going to do, instead of showing the least bit of diplomacy. They have alienated the Imperial power most open to new ideas, treaties, and even peace, over one system.  Edit: I should add that I am still opposed to going to war with the Federation; our princess has other things to worry about... stopping slavery and becoming Empress, for example. However, Winters-aligned commanders are NOT welcome in our systems."

Perhaps you're confusing Imperial slaves for the slavery endemic throughout the entire federation. If there is abuse and mistreatment, the owners need to be reported and dealt with severely. Imperial slaves are still regarded as human beings, unlike ""real slaves"" in the Federation.   Besides that, we all know what happens when you ban slavery: it gets driven deep underground, you give a monopoly to organized crime in the market, and the slaves end up worse than they were. As hard as the life of an Imperial slave is, it's 100 times better than any slave (wage, or otherwise) outside of Empire space. If we eliminate this institution, those who would have slaves will find ways to get them, and the only ones making a profit would be the crime lords. And unlike the Empire, the crime lords truly is cruel and uncaring, and they would like nothing more than for legal Imperial slavery to become a thing of the past so they can take advantage of this new-found monopoly.  Prohibition isn't the answer. Better regulation is. The federation is a perfect example of what we will become if we try to eliminate Imperial slavery. We don't need another carbon copy of the Federation in this Galaxy. There is already 1 Federation too many as it is."
AislingDuval,3buvlu,CMDR_Swift_Arrow,4,Fri Jul 3 04:05:00 2015 UTC,"I like how you call for sources, then make wild claims (e.g., Imperial slavery being better than wage slavery) without any backing. You also seem to repeat the same old Imperial point about Imperial Slavery not being as bad as regular slavery, and the black market in the Federation. Surely, as a commander, you must be aware that black markets are just as widespread in the Empire as they are anywhere else, and they will buy slaves just as happily as those in the Federation. Trade in human misery occurs no matter what, and no amount of regulation will do away with it.  Besides, there are times when Imperial Slavery is indistinguishable from regular slavery. This has primarily to do with the rotten political structure of the Empire. Both Torval and Patreus have openly and proudly violated Imperial law on slavery, taking as Imperial Slaves people who did not volunteer for that 'service'. However, because the Emperor has little actual power at this point, and each Senator is a lord in their own domain, they did not and will not face any consequences for their actions.   This really cuts to the heart of the issue. Yes, workers in the Federation are exploited to a heartbreaking degree, at least in most systems. However, the Imperial system seems bent on topping those abuses. With Imperial Slavery seeing as an honourable alternative to living with debt, Imperial rulers have a strong incentive to levy extra fines and taxes on the poorest members society to 'encourage' them to volunteer. Once they have those Imperial Slaves, while in theory there are laws in place to protect them, in practice there is no one to tell a Senator what to do or not to do in their domain. The results are clear - mistreatment, abuse and, inevitably, rebellions, two major ones within a month in Torval's demesne.   The Federation is a deeply flawed, corrupt entity - but Torval's vision of the Empire seems to be the result of someone looking at the Feds and saying ""yes, I like that, but how about we had less accountability and more worker exploitation?"". It's a vision of humanity reduced to nothing more than a balance sheet. It has been tried in the past, it hasn't worked and it continues to not work. As long as conservatives within the Empire continue to disregard Duval's vision, the Empire will continue to be seen as a neo-feudal cultural backwater."
AislingDuval,3buvlu,Cadoc,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:02:20 2015 UTC,"The part i called for sources as is the part about clones, as I don't remember reading anything about that. I should have been specific.   Let me say that what you say is not entirely invalid. No system is perfect, and the institution of Imperial Slavery still needs reforms (particularly in the enforcement of the laws, which even I admit is a problem). Patreus is a perfect example of what's wrong with the Institution, and the Empire is rife with corruption (which is what you describe). But abolishing Imperial slavery means abolishing the laws that protect Imperial Slaves (even if they are poorly enforced in some jurisdictions), and the Empire would inevitably go the path of the Federation as the current culture of hatred for debt slowly dies.  Imperial slavery, which isn't life-long, is the Empire's alternative to life-long, crushing debt. Like declaring bankruptcy, except without getting away scott free for taking money and then not paying it back (a form of theft in my view).   If we give this up, these abusive Imperial rulers will not go away, but rather learn the new rules and break them anyways.   You mention black markets, and yes they exist in the Empire. If you abolish Imperial Slavery, these slaves will only end up being sold on these black markets (as the owners would want to at least recoup some of their costs) and end up becoming just a slightly ""higher quality"" of slave........with no hope of ever escaping this status. The ones who profit: organized crime. I'd rather they didn't increase their market share of the slave trade.   Which brings another point: Aisling's point of view is not the popular one within the elite of the Empire (despite what the media would imply). This is why her father, Harold, was removed as the crown prince of the Empire. If an emperor, or emperess, were to ever try to abolish Imperial Slavery, you would end up with civil war. Then everyone loses, and the Federation would end up making gains. Yet this is the road Aisling would take us down, should she ever successfully get the throne."
AislingDuval,3buvlu,CMDR_Swift_Arrow,3,Fri Jul 3 17:09:09 2015 UTC,"We're trying to work with the groups that represent your power.   If things aren't communicated to us we can't work around it... you list the two times things didn't go your way, sure... but what about all the times we worked with you and around the systems you wanted to prep and expand?  We could counter by riffing off a list of systems that you guys prepped and expanded that cost us CC.  Given the biggest power behind Torval is EIC... and EIC have stated we don't have intentions to put Torval on the throne... wouldn't it behoove you to work with us, not against us?  Look to your leaders... we have a good working relationship with Aisling's Angels but every so often things get contested and we show we have deep pockets and won't be bullied."
AislingDuval,3buvlu,LiquidCatnip,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:46:28 2015 UTC,"Unlike the He Xingo incident, which we were backstabbed by rouge group, in Hollas and Maipuna cases, we were defeated in  fair games, I can only say Torval did a good job on their part and we did not pay enough attention to counter it.  Torval is not hostile, but also not a friendly power. We should not assume that they will not do anything against us because  we are both Empire powers. We should treat them as normal opponent as anyone else."
AislingDuval,3buvlu,LiquidCatnip,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:30:24 2015 UTC,By that logic... all other powers are normal opponents (or worse)... so with whom do you make friends?  Aisling can't do it on her own... Arissa has proven that.  I just see no logic in being enemies when we got 2 Fed factions and the Alliance (for some bizarre reason) undermining us constantly.
AislingDuval,3buvlu,Guiron,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:33:48 2015 UTC,"Strategically speaking, we can:  1) Allied with those who do not have direct competition with us to fight our neighbor, or 2) Allied with those weaker than us to fight the top factions  When we decided to set up forward bases near Fed, we cannot be friend with Fed anymore, so option 1 is out.  We can still go for option 2, form an alliance with number 6-10 to defense against Arissa, Torval and Winters. Arissa is out of action for a while and we are on a peace treaty, so we can count Arissa out. We should concentrate our forces to fight Winters . Torval is not our number 1 target at the moment, so let's keep the not hostile/not friendly status and get ready to fight when they have any aggressive action against us.  There is no friendship in Powerplay, there are only factions with common interest."
AislingDuval,3buvlu,SpaceTexas,2,Fri Jul 3 04:38:16 2015 UTC,"Maipuna was just bad coordination. Hollos felt a little more aggressive. Their expansion, like some of ours recently, are based on economics not CC. So I can't fault them for that."
AislingDuval,3buvlu,Guiron,2,Thu Jul 2 17:01:51 2015 UTC,This is literally the core of it all; there was poor communication that happened in those systems.
AislingDuval,3buvlu,CMDR_Swift_Arrow,2,Thu Jul 2 18:55:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, people thinking that Torval should have backed off their number one so we could get our number seven or whatever it was are not looking at it from both sides."
AislingDuval,3buvlu,Guiron,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:24:56 2015 UTC,"Hollos was chosen because had we not taken it, (and someone else took something in the area), it would have been far more damaging. In fact, there was one system Hollos exploits that, had it been made a control system by someone else, would have been extremely damaging (it was something like 17 systems it would have contested).   Hollos was actually a defensive move, not an aggressive one, and it merely enlarged the main cluster of systems."
AislingDuval,3buvlu,LiquidCatnip,2,Fri Jul 3 04:25:34 2015 UTC,"Just from my perspective, if you ignore lore, and I do because it is weak as hell, I think our best ally can be Torval.  First, Torval is EIC and EIC is Torval. What does EIC care about? Profit. What can Aisling provide? Profit. We have only started to realize how to best optimize our faction ability. The more we do, the more attractive our systems become to EIC. And if you aren't squeamish about imperial slavery, it's reciprocal. What we really need to do is start working with EIC to maximize our own system profits. That helps us in the long run way more than just decent CC systems that run us faster towards turmoil. I think we are getting the hang of it now, but only recently.  ALD I consider a decent neighbor, but one I'd be glad to have a nice cedar fence between us and them. They were very responsive about He Xingo and I think really do want to work together. Power play circumstances made it inevitable we would have some skirmishes, but they have generally been decent to us. I'd be lying if I didn't say that looking at He Xingo as that huge CC drain didn't make me smile, though.  I don't know what to think about Patreus. Unlike ALD, they support their rogue group, which is troubling because I think E.G. Is a larger influence there than they let on. And EG don't want to really cooperate in Power Play and do their own RP thing and make their own faction or whatever.  Patreus might officially support that, but I guarantee that in a month when Rishairs CC drain looks a lot like He Xingo does now, that the general Patreus supporters will figure it out quick. So it's hard for me to take them as an ally, even though lore would make it seem like a good fit, when they have a decently sized rogue group that wants to craft a power basically in between us and ALD and the official Patreus response is that they support it."
AislingDuval,3buvlu,Guiron,2,Thu Jul 2 19:09:53 2015 UTC,"Well, well, if it isn't the voice of reason?  I love people that see sense. :D"
AislingDuval,3buvlu,LiquidCatnip,3,Thu Jul 2 23:51:29 2015 UTC,"So many people fail to see the big picture. Frontier isn't going to make one faction King or Queen of the universe. It's a cyclical thing. There's gonna be a continuous rise and fall, though no one is ever going to ""win."" It won't happen. Maybe a faction disappears, but only most likely if they see a huge lack of player activity. The way you win is by positioning yourself to have the faction with the best way to feed your player base credits to pump out a mass of merits when and where you need them. A small, rich group of players who can react quickly is what you want out of you faction. We are like a freight train now. We move a ton of shit but want us to change course? Eh, that's gonna be painful.  But if you look at the PP system as a way to shape the environment, you can basically game the whole thing like some galactic cheat code. Imagine letting Delaine exploit a few Black Markets along the Onionhead Express. Or us exploiting every Palladium market. Or every RES being a ALD RES. Every High Tech system a Sirius High Tech system! It'll never happen because you have all these dumb RP groups and whatnot, but man, even if the Empire sat down and worked out who got what systems, we could do some insane stuff. Then just play Bumper Condas in Sag A*."
AislingDuval,3buvlu,Guiron,2,Fri Jul 3 00:16:18 2015 UTC,"We were going to set up some cool stuff using mechanics like that but every time we make a move like that FDEV coincidentally find a way to block it, it seems. ;)"
AislingDuval,3bvcvs,Lance_Spacecat,3,Thu Jul 2 13:30:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this. Hope you guys kind of clue us non AA types on the plans in the future. Also, what's up with the mods here?   It seems like there's 5 or so us here trying to herd cats and if we had something more official to point to, it'd help.  Last night if there was one voice saying Kwatsu or Maipuna, it could have made a difference."
AislingDuval,3bvcvs,Guiron,2,Thu Jul 2 17:10:45 2015 UTC,"Erm.. who exactly ""orders""? Didnt realize we are having an authority here :)"
AislingDuval,3bvcvs,CMDR_iFred,2,Thu Jul 2 15:12:52 2015 UTC,"Aisling's Angels updates it's standing orders weekly and on demand. The systems listed for preparation are taken from suggestions found here in reddit and from our own forums. Each system is scouted and compared to neighboring systems to determine the best point of entry in a given cluster. We carefully select our preparation options to best benefit our Power with the long term in mind (Fortifying difficulty, overhead costs, etc)  Of course, we have no direct control over pilots and supporters outside of Aisling's Angels but we hope our document provides the direction and coordination our power needs to succeed in Powerplay."
AislingDuval,3bvcvs,gnwthrone,2,Thu Jul 2 15:23:43 2015 UTC,Kthx.
AislingDuval,3bvcvs,CMDR_iFred,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:58:28 2015 UTC,I don't see Sounti in the expansion list in that document which means it is not really representing Aisling but rather potentially following another agenda - such as peace with Winters at at any sacrifice. As a result my wing will be ignoring this document for the time being. Edit: Sounti now included in the expansion list.
AislingDuval,3bvcvs,Rolesium,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:45:43 2015 UTC,"it's not in the document because Sounti wasn't our goal even last week. It's just another agenda of some independent wing. Unfortunatelly a lot more players went this way and prepped it. Sounti will just cause trouble. Not with feds, but with upkeep costs. So please consider again if you want to expand that system and cause harm to Aisling."
AislingDuval,3bvcvs,nisanick,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:12:59 2015 UTC,Actually Sounti's distance based upkeep costs are quite similar to Kelin Samba. Do keep in mind that Aisling's Angels aren't the only sizable wing in our power and certainly don't speak for the rest of us.
AislingDuval,3bvcvs,Rolesium,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:30:24 2015 UTC,"Since you seem intent on going after Sounti, I would genuinely like to hear your plans for combating the real enemy to our expansion: CC overhead. Because based on the rate we are expanding, Sounti will only be our control system for two, maybe three turns.   The issue is, no matter what we do, there is a limit to the amount of expansion we can do. We added 83 control systems this last week, and based on our expansions, we will be adding a similar number again this week. The guys over on ALD's forums have figured that the maximum sustainable number of systems is around 400, even if everything is completely fortified. Seeing as they just entered turmoil, it looks like their estimations are fairly accurate. The game mechanics simply don't allow for unending expansion.  Rest assured, we will be in turmoil within a few turns. According to the Powerplay manual , the systems with the highest upkeep are the ones that will be the first to go. Right now, our highest three are: Sounti (52)  Kelin Semba (46)  AC Yax Baru (45).   Thus, these are the first three systems we will lose when we've exceeded our limit, meaning they will not be our control systems anymore.   The only idea I can come up with to combat this is to hit our overhead number, let turmoil reduce us back down to sustainable levels, and then pick 1-2 forward bases that we really want (Personally Kalana and Kwatsu seem good to me). With the way preparation and expansion works, we'll constantly have to keep reacquiring our high upkeep systems every few cycles."
AislingDuval,3bvcvs,CMDRPedantic,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:02:38 2015 UTC,"I agree that this is the primary danger with expansion - but it is not one that we can not handle with careful management. Actually your list of highest upkeep costs isn't correct - Sounti would be first, with Kwatsu a close second, and Kelin Semba in third. That said, upkeep costs alone can not be used as the sole motivator for system acquisition as some systems are vastly more valuable strategically than others. I won't go into more details here - we have already seen the trouble that causes on a public subreddit ;)."
AislingDuval,3bvcvs,Rolesium,2,Thu Jul 2 21:17:42 2015 UTC,"You're totally right about the upkeep costs- I must have misread Kwatsu :P If you can figure out how to keep the management right and keep us from losing it, then more power to you. I assume you're part of a substantial wing of players, so that's pretty cool that you have you're own plans for making our space princess number 1. I'd only suggest you at least share those plans with the liaisons of the subreddit and the other power groups in our faction so they at least have an idea of what to expect. I'd hate to see us have infighting like ALD had over the whole He Xingo ordeal."

AislingDuval,3bwixf,fracturechris,2,Thu Jul 2 18:59:59 2015 UTC,"Welcome!  Aisling is all about hauling Powerplay commodities for Prep/Expand/Fortify.  For Prep/Expand you pick up the PPC (Powerplay Commodities) at any of our current control systems, and then deliver them to a station in the system being prepared or expanded.  For Fortifying you pick up the PPC at Cubeo (our Capital system) and take them to a station in one of our control systems that needs fortification.  Note1: Each action has its own PPC so make sure you grab the correct one.  Note2: You go to the Power Contact (under contacts) in the station menu to pick up and deliver PPCs. You can get a free shipment (size depends on rating with your power) every 30 minutes. But you can fast track (skip the cooldown) the next shipment buy spending 10k credits per PPC (ie: 100k credits for a 10 PPC shipment)"

If you're going to haul PP cargo (i.e. prep, fortify and/or expand), check out the weekly stickied post, don't just do it to the closest system because that can sometimes screw us over; our trusted allies pledged to ALD are in turmoil right now because of over-expansion."

AislingDuval,3bwixf,SergeantJezza,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:09:59 2015 UTC,"Fortify any systems in Control tab which have less than 100%.  Anything over 100% is wasted.  Expand any systems in the Expansion tab which have not yet reached their expansion threshold, or which have a significant opposition. (So NOT Clido Pi, Aluriates, or Shapsugabus)  Drop Prep points in systems in the Preparation tab, but be careful.  Some systems which in the Top Ten list are bad, they will be liabilities rather than assets, so only do those which are listed in the Objectives sticky thread. Also systems at near top of the Top Ten prep list probably don't need more prep points.  Make money, (eg. by buy Palladium, Progenitor Cells and sell them at Aisling Control systems, these give high buy prices), and use the money to buy Prep, Expansion or Fortify materials which you can use as above.  Perhaps save the money until later in the weekly cycle (which ends 0700 Thursday UTC) so you know where to deliver for best effect."

AislingDuval,3buplq,Scraaty84,5,Thu Jul 2 08:34:04 2015 UTC,"We will fall into turmoil at somepoint too. Even if all of us on the subreddit and forums stopped expanding, the merit-grinders will cause us to expand.

AislingDuval,3buplq,ju87,3,Thu Jul 2 11:46:51 2015 UTC,"Best strategy we've come up with so far is deliberately prepping systems within 15ly of one another. That way, only one can win. Unfortunately, that's difficult to orchestrate and get buy-in on. It's a complete paradigm shift to get used to once you reach that Overhead threshold where every system starts costing more than it makes.  If you can pull that off, you'll prolong your time prior to turmoil.

AislingDuval,3buplq,CMDR_Corrigendum,2,Thu Jul 2 21:55:03 2015 UTC,"What does this mean, practically? Is it just that they can't Prepare new systems until they've Fortified their existing Control systems?  And perhaps more relevant: how can we avoid this happening to Aisling?"
AislingDuval,3buplq,demondownload,4,Thu Jul 2 08:42:34 2015 UTC,"Advice from what I can see:   Expand into systems with the most CC, but least amount of exploited/contested systems. (Overheads is affected by total number of systems) Avoid expanding towards anybody - this is the mistake that ALD made, but not much we can do about rogue elements. Contested systems contribute to upkeep and overheads, but nothing towards income. (So, they're actually twice as bad as what the game actually shows on the tooltips) Don't fall into the trap of targeting high CC green systems. They have a seriously large amount of upkeep and overheads involved in them. You actually want the orange systems - that way, you should get more control systems for the same amount of overheads. You only need the green systems when you want to expand quickly."
AislingDuval,3buplq,AYKP,2,Thu Jul 2 08:56:10 2015 UTC,"In a way, our merit grinders have actually been helping us. They've been good for two to three orange systems a week. So thanks, I guess?  Still not the best mechanic."
AislingDuval,3buplq,Guiron,2,Thu Jul 2 09:02:15 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate on green vs orange?
AislingDuval,3buplq,rdslw,5,Thu Jul 2 09:19:21 2015 UTC,"On the system powerplay map, it shows green as high CC income systems, orange as low and red as negative.  Green systems typically have alot of exploited systems, and thus a lot of income. But the problem is that they also have a lot of overhead costs too, but that isn't shown anywhere.  Orange has less income, but you're going to manually check each one to find out why:   They could have contested systems in them They could have a lot of low population systems Or, they could have small number of systems in the exploited radius. These are probably the ones you want.   So TL;DR: Maximise the income, but minimise the number of systems in the exploited radius. And avoid contested systems at all costs!"
AislingDuval,3buplq,AYKP,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:32:35 2015 UTC,But do we actually want more control systems? More control systems means more work to fortify when we reach the overhead ceiling.
AislingDuval,3buplq,Isabelle_Montbarron,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:50:13 2015 UTC,"True. But is it really an issue with how many pilots Aisling has?  Also, it depends on how the Galactic standings works. If it uses the number of control systems, then you might be able to get a higher percentage by having more control systems than everyone else. But we can only speculate on that, since no-one knows how the standing is calculated."
AislingDuval,3buplq,AYKP,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:57:58 2015 UTC,"It could become one, if we lose a bunch of players after they get their shields.   You are correct that it does depend on how galactic standing is calculated, which we indeed know little about. =("
AislingDuval,3buplq,Isabelle_Montbarron,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:38:58 2015 UTC,As far as I know they will lose the two control systems at the end of the cycle if they still have negative cc. But I'm not sure how to avoid this except from fortifying. ALD fortified all systems last cycle but after expansion it was still too expensive to maintain. So I think we will have to stop expanding at one point in the future or find out a way to get rid of unprofitable systems somehow.
AislingDuval,3buplq,Guiron,2,Thu Jul 2 08:49:46 2015 UTC,"Sucks, because I sort of think they fell into a trap that was laid just for them. They were almost doomed to prep too fast and now it's going to be hard to dig out. And the mechanics weren't super apparent until maybe last week or so.  That said, we need to be smart to avoid this as long as we can. It will eventually happen but smart prep can definitely slow it down."

As they have entered a Turmoil state and considering the problem Powers have with controlling all the players pledged to them this is an Amazing show of organisation. Just wow.

AislingDuval,3buplq,AYKP,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:12:53 2015 UTC,That's actually because we literally can't prep systems. The game won't let us drop any corruption reports anywhere.
AislingDuval,3buplq,Gswine,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:55:43 2015 UTC,I'm putting my thinking down to lack of sleep. Still I may have got things wrong but the sentiment was heart felt :)
AislingDuval,3buplq,rdslw,-3,Fri Jul 3 02:55:20 2015 UTC,How other powers can harm ALD now?
AislingDuval,3buplq,McFergus,3,Thu Jul 2 09:20:45 2015 UTC,They can't. No other power harmed us. We have hit the maximum number of systems PP allows a Power to control. You will hit that in 2 weeks :)  Good luck.
AislingDuval,3buplq,demondownload,0,Thu Jul 2 12:25:16 2015 UTC,"Undermining the Fortification of their Control systems could be troublesome, since it'll make it harder for them to get back in the black, CC-wise."
AislingDuval,3buplq,rdslw,-6,Thu Jul 2 09:28:01 2015 UTC,"Undermining fortification is going to be hard, as there is no race there. They hit 100% and they're done.  Of course doing it will take them CC they intend to restore by fortifying so it makes some sense I suppose.  What about sending some 5th column player to EXAPND their current expansion list? This should hit them hard!"

AislingDuval,3bunrp,gnwthrone,3,Thu Jul 2 08:07:10 2015 UTC,"Looks good. Would like to have the other Empire factions take a look and lets us know -   1: Does this conflict with anything you've got going on  and  2: Any rogue groups you can't control operating in this area?  /u/Rockser11 (ALD) /u/CmdrEleshenar (Patreus) /u/LiquidCatnip (Torval) are their main Reddit leaders, I believe.  I went ahead and dumped 200 or so into Ienpalang. My hope is that the merit farmers wake up, see this, and start hauling there instead of Beker. Guess we will see, though.  Predicting the merit grind spots will be HIP 116710 (Karsuki Ti crew continues the path) and judging from very early numbers but it's location makes sense, Okua'gsa. Neither are extremely terrible but like most merit prep, just sort of a waste. Oh, also, Karsuki Ti will have 1328597% fortification.  Edit:  Here are the other factions current lists -   ALD - None  Patreus -   Orannika  HIP 13841  Shonso  Mundigal  Lileni  HR 826  Negasargun   Torval -   Naunin  LTT 7330"
AislingDuval,3bunrp,Guiron,3,Thu Jul 2 08:15:29 2015 UTC,Seems OK from our perspective... I'll have my strategy team revise it and get a firm answer back ASAP.   Paging /u/gnwthrone

AislingDuval,3bunrp,Guiron,2,Thu Jul 2 08:21:55 2015 UTC,We're focusing on systems that are close to our main cluster given what happened last cycle - we were spread out too thin due to Kwatsu-Kalana-Sounti.  I personally don't recommend Ac Yax Baru. At least for this turn. Kalana is enough to reach Winters and Mahon while Kelin Samba is good to reach Hudson and Delaine
AislingDuval,3bunrp,demondownload,2,Thu Jul 2 08:38:23 2015 UTC,This and also - Shield Week. No idea what that's gonna look like once people get their shields. I'm guessing and HOPING that the merit farming drops. But not sure what it ends up being.
AislingDuval,3bunrp,Vaestmannaeyjar,2,Thu Jul 2 08:58:52 2015 UTC,I'm always at work by the time the PP update shakes out - what's the top 10 looking like now?
AislingDuval,3bunrp,Guiron,2,Thu Jul 2 08:44:27 2015 UTC,Right now it's anyone's game with points under 200 and 5 in the list (excluding Maipuna). Maipuna strangely is still getting preparation points even though we theoretically can't expand into it anymore  edit: oh you meant the power standings. Well guiron answered that

AislingDuval,3bunrp,demondownload,2,Thu Jul 2 08:48:20 2015 UTC,Weren't we at 5 already? I could've sworn we were at the end of the top row last week.
AislingDuval,3bunrp,Guiron,2,Thu Jul 2 08:50:00 2015 UTC,I think so? Not sure what is/isn't updated on the UI. It definitely says Standing Increased for us.   I think what might be going on is that Hudson and Winters are in a tie at 68% while we are at 65%. So I'd technically call us in 4th place.

AislingDuval,3bul22,OnwardFlying,2,Fri Jul 3 21:36:07 2015 UTC,"I wonder if it is because of contested systems. Before successfully prepared, it gives us the net profit figure. When it is in expansion stage, it gives us gross profit figure."
AislingDuval,3bul22,Isabelle_Montbarron,2,Thu Jul 2 08:52:04 2015 UTC,It might be counting the CC value from the systems we are already exploiting. But which one is correct? Can two control systems exploit the same system as long as it's the same power?

So basically feels like a Shield Booster without needing a slot for one... Or maybe for energy surplus builds like Conda/Python can do its an 'extra' booster
AislingDuval,3bvl8v,Hy3jii,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:22:39 2015 UTC,"+50% power draw. It's good for a ship that isn't power starved or trading ships as they don't need weapons and usually downgrade their shields for increased cargo capacity.

AislingDuval,3blu7a,gnwthrone,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:06:06 2015 UTC,I commented on this in beta...it didnt change. The problem with aisling that i have found so far is that because of idiot traders killing routes every week because they are lazy (hip 10786 to karsuki is dead now) they keep prepping trade route systems and this kills their routes.  It wont be long until these sa.e idiots decide that they cant make a buck in aislings space..and they will have no clue that its all their fault.  Of course the other issue with aisling territory is that there is so little high tech that gold progenitor cell/performance enhancers trade is non existent a d this type of routing would provide the best profits within the acceptable limits at high tech systems (supply dependant)  The next 2 weeks are going to be telling..shields will probably be a lot of peoples big ticket items in the reward scheme of things but a lot of people are going to bail too..but shields being a unique slot on a ship..khaleesi will always be popular..but trade is going to get worse until torval space gets closer to ours.

Here's something I've been working on this cycle that shows where the action is  - http://www.reddit.com/r/AislingDuval/comments/3bl4pi/flashpoints_updated/  As far as your ships go, you should be good to participate. But you're probably going to want to ensure that you are able to contribute to your credit total as well as to the PP goals. So I'd say that undermining, right now, isn't something you should be looking into. It costs credits versus potentially making credits trading materials.  As far as what ships to move towards, honestly, that's up to you. Every ship type can contribute to PP. I'd recommend all-rounders just for being able to switch roles on the fly and be more versatile, but again, personal preference is more important.  The conflict is against Winters right now. The best way you can help is by helping to bring Sealed Contracts to either Kalana or Kwatsu. My suggestion is to leave from Woyo Mina, deliver the Contracts in Kalana, on the return trip to Woyo Mina stop in Wei Chang and purchase Progenitor Cells. Sell those at Woyo Mina and keep the loop going as much as your wallet allows.   Another way you can help is by Fortifying. That would also give you a chance to explore within Aisling space and get familiar with the territory. You can pick up the materials from Cubeo (the HQ) and take them to any unfortified system. Note that anything past 100% is a waste. You can also trade while doing this and it's a nice way to make steady credits, help the effort, and learn what stations buy and sell.  As far as border systems go, everyone has their own preference. If you're looking for PvP you probably want to look towards the Fed sides. This week, there aren't too many options past Cartoi, Woyo Mina and maybe Grovichun. If we succeed in Kalana, Kwatsu, and Sounti though, that's gonna change.  The best outfitting stations are Chona and CD-72 190.  And as far as bodies goes, definitely Kwatsu and Kalana are the hotbeds of PvP activity. Though, being honest here, you guys might be undergunned. If you want to try undermining though, you can be pretty successful as a wing. Just need to plan on your outfitting."
AislingDuval,3blkuj,Guiron,2,Tue Jun 30 05:38:32 2015 UTC,"Welcome aboard!  Right now our primary objective is to get Kwatsu and Kalana ways above the opposition. Secondary is fortifying control systems which have not yet reached the 100% trigger.  If you prefer blowing stuff up, Kwatsu and Kalana are being taken so you don't need to travel far when hunting in non-imperial power territory. So by Thrusday, 7am UTC, you'll be able to easily collect merits following a combat playstyle.  What you have is good enough to participate. The DB Explorer is a good long jump range combat ready ship with a reasonable cargo hold. If you want to help out with the delivery objectives, the Asp explorer is a good ship to start with.  You can take advantage of our passive trade bonus by bringing in low cost (12500-13000cr) Palladium to Cubeo or Kasuki Ti. It should net you 2500-3100 cr/t for a one way trip.  We're looking forward to working with you and your wing! :)"
AislingDuval,3blkuj,gnwthrone,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:52:35 2015 UTC,"As one of the new Wing V8's talking about, where can I buy said Palladium?"
AislingDuval,3blkuj,Kamenos,2,Wed Jul 1 13:38:22 2015 UTC,"An alternative. If your preference is for fighting, not trading, and both your skill level and equipment need upgrading b4 seriously engaging in PvP.  Take up residence for a while in a system like Oppidavasti, on the edge of contested and unclaimed space, there are currently 3 wars within a 15ly range, and there are numerous systems surrounding that have ample opportunities for a bounty hunter, try Julastii to begin whr thr r over 10 RES's. Nearest shipyard/outfitter Selkadiae provides an excellent range.  Holding this space is essential to the security of the Lady's recent expansion into Bellaung, active combatant CMDRs in the area will help ensure that happens."
AislingDuval,3blkuj,CMDRnooc,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:53:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip! We've been in Mirolunts over the last few nights, flying around in conflict zones and propping up the local fascist party. Not my proudest mercenary contract.  We're probably going to head over to Oppidavasti next.   I'm also not sure how'd we do in PVP right now. Conflict zones have been good, just to get comfortable with combat and get a feel for fighting different types of ships. But going up against experienced CMDRs in Vultures is probably not something we can take on just yet. The thing we have going for us right now is most likely teamwork. We're a halfway decent CSGO team, and that's the skill that probably carries over best."

AislingDuval,3blkuj,FAAmecanic,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:41:04 2015 UTC,"we do PVP and undermining, as well as merit farming. Its within our interests to get our pilots into the best ships possible so we can get to the end-game. Which is blowing up other players."
AislingDuval,3bl4pi,Guiron,3,Tue Jun 30 02:44:06 2015 UTC,"I'm concerned about Maipuna.  Last week Torval had an intense Prep battle with Patreus for LFT 78.  They added many thousands of prep points during Wednesday night and won the system. (And that was at the same time as an epic expansion battle at Haroingori which they also won).  Here the competition is between our Maipuna and their HIP 95256.  Only one of these can go though to expansion.  We're currently 8k ahead, but Torval could easily surpass that with a late surge.  HIP 95256 is at the top of their Prep list and has the highest CC potential, I doubt they'll let it lose without a fight.  Be ready for a prep points battle on Wednesday night."
AislingDuval,3bl4pi,Kryfield,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:28:37 2015 UTC,We just have to watch it and Sounti closely as we near the tick over. Either of these could be out-prepped with a large enough burst so we will just need to be ready to do the same.
AislingDuval,3bl4pi,Rolesium,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:08:26 2015 UTC,It jumped a huge amount tonight. Definitely worth monitoring closely.
AislingDuval,3bl4pi,Isabelle_Montbarron,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:32:48 2015 UTC,Maipuna and HIP 95256 are now almost even (less than 100 prep difference)
AislingDuval,3bl4pi,Azmondar,2,Wed Jul 1 20:25:33 2015 UTC,"Hip 95256 31019 Maipuna 31080  They are winning  1505 ca time  Hip 34,569 prep now.  Maipuna at 34140 they pulled 2k ahead"
AislingDuval,3bl4pi,Isabelle_Montbarron,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:28:17 2015 UTC,"I'll be trying to keep an eye on Beker when I can, since we really want to keep it out of our top 10 prep list.  Beker currently at 21436 prep (Thurs 03:56 UTC).  Please send some prep towards Karakasis so Beker stays off our top 10 list."
AislingDuval,3bl4pi,Isabelle_Montbarron,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:54:02 2015 UTC,Karakasis may need a little more help then.
AislingDuval,3bl4pi,Zurgarth,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:34:26 2015 UTC,It's getting quite close again... about 300 prep points from breaking back into our top 10.
AislingDuval,3bl4pi,SpiritOfRedemption,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:57:29 2015 UTC,"Your inclusion of staging points for each of the system's objectives is awesome. Deff saves time. Also, are we still working on opposing He Xingo's expansion? Last time I checked, we were losing the race."
AislingDuval,3bl4pi,Rolesium,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:01:39 2015 UTC,"No clue. Heard it was bugged and haven't checked in since. At this point, probably not worth it. Time better spent versus the Empire."
AislingDuval,3bl4pi,GriM_AoD,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:18:31 2015 UTC,"Update 0:54 server time: Guardian Angels Harry Rush and myself have chased away several Winters supporters from Kwatsu. Earlier tonight, I spotted a wing of 4 in Kwatsu interdicting players, but I've been unable to get all of their names. Mostly Archon Delaine opportunists, but at least one was a Denton Patreus supporter... Two vultures, a Fer-de-Lance and a Python.  I suspect several underminers got chased to solo, as opposition jumped to 338%, while expansion only went up to 371%. Keep an eye out, commanders."
AislingDuval,3bl4pi,SirMightySmurf,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:57:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think this is the beginning of a focused effort. Sounti prep and Kalana undermining have dropped off. Believe this is an all or nothing push at Kwatsu."
AislingDuval,3bkz1c,maxrizk,3,Tue Jun 30 01:57:22 2015 UTC,Ienpalang. This is in order to exploit the Beker system as a valuable trade hub exporting Palladium.
AislingDuval,3bkz1c,Rolesium,4,Tue Jun 30 02:12:14 2015 UTC,"I think next week we need to stay local. It's going to be a lotta work fortifying, probably battling for Sounti, and keeping out unwanted systems in our own power. Plus, who knows what's gonna happen as it is shield week.  I really encourage next week to be played close to our control systems, staying small and consolidating for a week until we see what happens with the numbers and where we start to see resistance.  There are a few exceptions. Conii definitely needs to finally come over. Ienpalang, as well. I believe that ALD will be ok with this. They should be, at least. It will generate so much income for everyone, long term  Angrbon might be nice and work to distract the grinders. Otherwise, maybe we can direct them upwards towards Chuuah. Seems that horde has been going from Karsuki Ti in that direction since this started. Doubt that would change now."
AislingDuval,3bkz1c,Guiron,2,Tue Jun 30 02:59:21 2015 UTC,Don't forget Kalana/Kwatsu. We'll be able to pick up prep materials from those next cycle
AislingDuval,3bkz1c,GriM_AoD,0,Tue Jun 30 04:57:32 2015 UTC,"One thing I think we really should work out with our fellow Empire factions is to each take ONE system for undermining with Winters. Like say, Patreus takes San Qin Gu, ALD takes Kaura, We take Sengen Sama, Torval takes LHS 2150.  Undermining Expansions makes WAY more sense than undermining fortifications. Splitting Winters playerbase up is their vulnerability. If we each took one of the expansions and all succeeded, we could basically make this entire cycle for Winters a wasted cycle.  Not sure who talks to the council or whatever, but this method would be way better than what it is now."
AislingDuval,3bkz1c,Guiron,2,Wed Jul 1 00:42:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with Ienpalang, and the whole reason for taking this system is it's neighbor Beker. Beker would be great as an exploited system, but terrible as a Control system, as it's one of the largest palladium supply systems in the empire (and i'd rather not have it ruined by merit grinders turning it into a control system).     I'd also like to recommend HIP 105391. It's a system out past Cailli, generates 100 CC, Industrial/Extraction econ that consumes palladium and gold (good for Control). Only downside is the station is a little far from the star at ~2500 LS (but that's not THAT bad).     Some up near Kalana I took a look at include Lo Muscae (good for CC not so good for trading), and either AC Yax Baru or Djinajeri which conflict with each other (I'd go with Djinajeri over AC Yax Baru since it's a better economy but slightly less CC). Runapa in the same cluster as those two would be perfect if it weren't for the 45k+ LS supercruise trip to the station.     Of course any systems that were on the list this last cycle that didn't get prepared will likely still be good choices (Conii etc.)"
AislingDuval,3bkz1c,Isabelle_Montbarron,2,Tue Jun 30 02:27:41 2015 UTC,"High time I apply to reddit and make my voice heard. First off: thanks all for the suggestions. Just so everyone knows, I'm 'Internal liaison officer' in the Aisling Angels group, mostly I work in teamspeak and the Angels forum, and I was the scout guy that helped our PP coordinators make our turn 4 list.   Turn 5 won't look as pretty, but it'll do. Also a friendly heads up, I'm off on a big exploration trip, so I'll be counting on you guys to scout for turn 6. :)   Just please remember to scout the systems you suggest, check if there's big pads, and check the value for traders too. (Is the population large or better?)  Good news: extraction will most certainly become desirable again in a few weeks, the devs have listened to our bug report about trading.  So we're not just doing industrial next turn."
AislingDuval,3bkz1c,Lance_Spacecat,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:39:57 2015 UTC,Rhea. Nice system - couple of earth-likes. Good location for an even-more-forward-base. (This is a joke for the fed spies who hang around our reddit.)
AislingDuval,3bkz1c,Rolesium,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:12:27 2015 UTC,"Yan musu is pretty close and gives a 71 CC profit. It's close to Torval, but i'm think they won't mind."
AislingDuval,3bkz1c,ElAlexPatino,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:10:20 2015 UTC,I agree with staying local. Or at least fortifying our position. I think one of the biggest threats is always going to be over stretching a power. And certainly not until we get a grip on who out there will move on with there shields over the next week or two.  I can see a lot of powers over extending the selfs over time and paying heavy for it.  You can already see beginnings of this with some.
AislingDuval,3bkz1c,Mercutio-Mcduff,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:49:25 2015 UTC,"OK.  I bring to your attention Bellaung, an isolated and disconnected Duval outpost. ALD is exploiting systems, Saruna as an eg, that lie between Bellaung and the bulk of the Duval holdings; a potential wedge of ALD influence that may, when ALD decides, cut Bellaung off from the rest of Duval space. The Princess would lose this system and all that could connect it to the main holding when ALD have been permitted to consolidate and expand the wedge. Make Bellaung safe and connected, or, put in jeopardy the Princess' holdings and risk losing the intervening systems and Bellaung with them."
AislingDuval,3bkz1c,CMDRnooc,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:02:29 2015 UTC,"I usually have a bunch of suggestions for prep but since seeing posts analyzing the Upkeep process I've been a little unsure.  Understanding that there will be CMDR's that prep regardless I reckon we need still need to have a prep list but it feels like it is time to consolidate what we have, maybe fill some gaps between our core systems and our outliers especially after Sounti.   We have Turn 4 which may be our most uncertain turn. We could be facing massive player drift due to Faction Weapon unlock, Winters borders will now bump against ours and while Winters players will be becoming more of a problem I expect Hudson to be looking to make some noise (Examine WW PISCIS AUSTRINI - complete repair/rearm/outfitting combo and two blackmarkets - Looks like a staging area for harassing runs on the Empire), not to mention the fact that we still have three other very active Empire factions that have gone a little quite waiting to see how we faced of with Winters.   It was an interesting week, I just wonder if we are ready to take a tactical change in focus of our efforts to see where the dust settles."
AislingDuval,3bkz1c,Gswine,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:07:56 2015 UTC,"Really good suggestions so far, keep it up! Remember, we cannot risk jumping too far from our Homeworld, Cubeo. (Like something less than 160 ly would be ideal.)"
AislingDuval,3bkz1c,SpaceTexas,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:19:15 2015 UTC,"Had to have a look. I'd suggest   Chun Tstar - Extraction/Agriculture: Support for Kalana   AC YAX BARO - Refinary/Terra, large pop: A little away from the action but there are some Powers poking around about there and I reckon it would be far enough away to be useful while not being a burden to us.  YAN MUSU - Refinery/Industrial, large pop: Backs up MAIPUNA (fingers crossed)   KAVALLIYALA - Industrial/extraction: Natural extension from Cailli, honestly though this system is a push but it's just a suggestion.  As always discussion on these is welcome as hopefully it will improve my system spotting skills!!"
AislingDuval,3bkz1c,Gswine,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:14:20 2015 UTC,"Whatever we end up doing this week, can we PLEASE scrub our systems vs other Empire faction systems. We do not want to be fighting on 3 fronts (Torval, Patreus, Winters) again if it can be avoided.   Also, we need to try to figure out all these damn rogue groups that keep popping up like EG and OIC. Preferably before we've dumped over 10k+ prep..."

We might be able to fortify all systems this cycle, but next cycle will be more difficult with 6 more systems to fortify. We might not be able to keep all preparation/expansion/fortification successful in 2-3 cycles.  We might have to give up some systems in our expansion list to limit the number of controlled systems and control the increasing overhead/fortification costs."

AislingDuval,3biqvm,SergeantJezza,6,Mon Jun 29 19:05:54 2015 UTC,I'm heading to Fed space to shoot ships aligned to Felicia Winters. The huge downside is it takes freaking ages in a Vulture to go that far. It took like 20 jumps with many scooping stops. Then I have to get back to Khaleesi space before the end of the week to cash in...  This might turn out to be more trouble that it's worth.
AislingDuval,3biqvm,jonfitt,2,Mon Jun 29 16:12:24 2015 UTC,Why not just leave your vulture in Winter's space and take a hauler back to turn in your merits?   That's what I'm doing in Archon's space.

Look at her panels in Powerplay and check out their Control and Expanding systems.   Then grab a FSD interdictor in outfitting, and a extra fuel tank plus a fuel scoop. Then go to those systems, start interdicting Fed couriers/Fed agents/Fed aid. Just get behind them in supercruise and press the interdictor button. You get 15 merits per kill when you bring them back to Aisling controlled systems."

But what about other rep affects? Does it affect Major faction rep to kill agents of a Power aligned with that major faction? Will I lose Fed rep by attacking Winter's ships?"
AislingDuval,3biqvm,gnwthrone,2,Tue Jun 30 17:53:42 2015 UTC,"Welcome aboard fellow CMDR!  denying expansions and undermining control systems are the only way an aisling angel can earn merits via combat.  For powers that are not related to the Empire that means going to their systems and blowing stuff up. In expansion systems you need to go to resistance areas (similar to nav beacons) and help the local forces who are resisting the expansion by blowing up the enemy, you get 1 merit for each ship you blow up. In control systems it means interdicting enemy ships and destroying them, you get 15 merits for each ship.  For powers related to the empire you are to interdict enemy(?) ships and steal their cargo without blowing them up for both expansions and control systems, I am not sure how many merits you get because I have not undermined any Empire powers as of yet.  You only get the merits themselves after you hand in the powerplay tokens at an aisling control system.  NOTE: You WILL get bounties on your head in the systems you undermine, they might be your enemies but they are the law in said system.  NOTE2: If you die before you hand in the powerplay vouchers you get for for destroying enemies in our control systems you lose them, so make sure you get back home safe!  Happy hunting!"

Consider this: with no one else's help, your cause is genuinely hopeless. The game seems designed that way, because one power can't control a space the size of the Empire, and thus Aisling alone can't eliminate slavery. ALD and Patreus' bonuses are not slave related, at least."

AislingDuval,3bhl1y,demondownload,3,Mon Jun 29 18:28:59 2015 UTC,"I'm equally ""sensitive"" about both; a person forced into servitude by a balance sheet is just as captive as one forced into servitude by the barrel of a gun."
AislingDuval,3bhl1y,GriM_AoD,2,Mon Jun 29 18:32:14 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, an Imperial citizen can't be forced into it, so a fair assumption is that most of them sign themselves up (regarded as a noble act in our society that values honour) and can be seen something like signing up for the military. Imperial slavery just isn't comparable to the other, as such, disliking them both equally doesn't seem right."

We can really leverage some economies and do some insane things in our space if we allow those preps to happen."
AislingDuval,3bhf4m,CMDR_iFred,2,Mon Jun 29 06:23:29 2015 UTC,"in my experience...the absolute worst thing you can do is talk about it in the forums, people use these 'hints' to 5th column us."
AislingDuval,3bhf4m,Duanedibly,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:17:02 2015 UTC,"Yes.  But which system can we bring into the Top Ten to replace it?  Simply not prepping it won't help.  It will stay in the Top ten until replaced.  There nearest prep points candidate is currently Beker, which is also bad.  You could check out the current points total for HIP 105391 which was previously in the prep list.  Unfortunately we can't see it's prep points without docking there.  Eventually, all the good extraction sites will be ruined by the credit/merit grinders.  Karakasis is already more than 2k points ahead of the next in the list, and is increasing its lead.  We would need to get all those 3, plus a replacement past it, and keep them there even as Karakasis increases its own points.  I doubt that's feasible, given what we need to work to keep the lead at Kwatsu and Kalana in case the opposition does a last-minute dump of kill-confirmations there.  And also keep Maipuna well ahead or Torval's competing HIP 95256."
AislingDuval,3bhf4m,Kryfield,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:13:29 2015 UTC,You can check out Karuku (L) or Conii (platform). Both systems are in our objectives list for the week and not in the top 10. They should have seen a reasonable amount of preparation already done for them.
AislingDuval,3bhf4m,gnwthrone,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:16:39 2015 UTC,"Yesterday, Karuku was about 6k and Conii about 4k, so both are far behind.  If you seriously want to try and eject Karakasis then you need to identify and agree on the replacement candidate."
AislingDuval,3bhf4m,Kryfield,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:45:31 2015 UTC,It's going to be better to focus on boosting the bottom 3 to prevent Beker from going back in the list. That and sending in contracts to our K and K forward bases
AislingDuval,3bgekt,CMDRAlcubierre,6,Mon Jun 29 00:14:42 2015 UTC,"The aggression on Sounti is understandable, no idea who started it and is still prepping it but it was ballsy and they're sticking to it, gotta give them that.  But declaring Kalana/Kwatsu targets was too far imo, and the way it was brazenly announced on our reddit was just throwing down the gauntlet. No way I could accept such an affront. I've been defending Kalana/Kwatsu for the majority of the cycle so far and today have been making them pay for attacking those systems."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,GriM_AoD,3,Mon Jun 29 00:45:49 2015 UTC,"Their diplomacy need work. I get that maybe they were being undermined from every direction and they are a little frustrated. The game does have fairness issues, like there are more players and factions for the Empire. Since the Empire factions essentially can't undermine each other effectively, those factions would go after the nearest enemy.   But negotiations are a give and take, they had to offer us something for us to give up something. They can't just come and say ""you can't have these 3, or else"" and expect people to comply. It's probably too late for this cycle, as many of us are battle mode to take all 3. But for future reference, a little bit of diplomacy goes a long way."

You don't break into someone's house, have them catch you in the act and then ""negotiate""  if they let you have their stuff from them you won't steal it from them?  No, but thanks anyways.  Actual diplomacy would have been coming over to us before hand and said ""Hey, we are looking for some cool neighbors who won't mind that we party all night, you guys cool with that?""  Instead, you guys wanted to do your thing and not actually practice diplomacy, because hey you guys are big and bad and can take what you want without having to answer to anyone.  Maybe you need to play Risk, or The Civilization games to see what a diplomatic victory is."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,SykoEsquire,3,Mon Jun 29 04:11:38 2015 UTC,"Look.  I'll give you Sounti, you have a point on that one.  It's basically right on your border.  I have no idea who's prepping it.  I know why (roughly) but I don't know who, and it certainly wasn't in any directive that I've seen.  Sadly, much like ALD last week with their rogue group, we can't control all players. But Kalana and Kwatsu aren't on your borders.  They're in open space.  You can sputter on about how it's your reasonable right of expansion, but there's no such bloody thing.  There is no right of expansion to open space, whether it be close-ish to your borders or not. If another faction started going after a system on our border, I'd be up in arms too.  But if they were just doing one close to our borders, while I might be a bit miffed and try to oppose them for it, I bloody well wouldn't go on their subreddit and start throwing around accusations like you did.  I also bloody well wouldn't go on their subreddit and start telling them ""I won't let this happen"" and telling them ""this is how its going to play out""  like the other guy did. Those 2 actions alone, regardless of anything else, put a lot of us in fight mode.  You're not going to allow this to happen?  What you say is how its going to play out? (I know this was the other guy, not you, but 'you' as in your faction)  The **** you say.  Come at me with an arrogant attitude like that and you're gonna get shown what arrogant really is.  It wouldn't surprise me if the people prepping Sounti are doing it at least in part just to spite you."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,CMDRtanthanos,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:29:40 2015 UTC,"But the only reason you are being undermined at Kalana and Kwatsu is because of Sounti, this is about to get very circular...."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,jozincarnate,3,Mon Jun 29 04:33:48 2015 UTC,"That action and the way it was announced is what escalated the situation, dragging players from our side who wouldn't usually care about Sounti as we've been 'called to arm's, I've seen the term fight mode thrown around.  And now that more feel called to Sounti, the more feds attacking Kalana/Kwatsu... circular indeed, though I believe it was avoidable had Winters not escalated it.  Had Winters focused the effort that's been placed on all 3 on Sounti, you'd be winning it, and a lot of us in Aisling camp wouldn't really care."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,GriM_AoD,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:11:25 2015 UTC,"I agree that the post is a very strong 'Call to action' kinda post and was always going to inflame the situation, but lets be honest about what started it and that is Sounti. The aggression that was started by your power created the situation in the first place, so the responses you see are from people going on the defensive. As for the escalation of events, you ought to be able to see that it would be inevitable (what are we just meant to let you park on our driveway whilst you go shopping in our space!). Don't expect people to just roll over for you because your a bigger (player based) power. I also have proposed a solution to our problem, what you do with it (amend it, ignore it, carry on with the status quo.) is up to you. But at least understand that whether out of your hands or not, you are the aggressor in this and that is currently how we perceive you."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,jozincarnate,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:32:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed that Sounti was the primary instigator and an aggressive move. But I can't point out those players/group responsible nor do I know anyone who can, but I guess that's kinda moot now. Not to mention, there's no official directives of any sort pushing Sounti, so telling the faceless to stop is unlikely to help.  Though it doesn't invalidate my point about a more measured Winters response would have likely avoided most of this and succeeded in suppressing Sounti.  As for 'shopping in your space', Kalana/Kwatsu lie in what is really a buffer between Fed/Imperial space. If you see it as your space, well, I'll have to respectfully disagree ;)"
AislingDuval,3bgekt,GriM_AoD,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:47:15 2015 UTC,"Again, most 'Winterites' have no major problem with Kalana/Kwatsu (we don't see it as our space). The shopping in our space' analogy is referred to Sounti. The action that has been taken on Kalana/Kwatsu is the response because of Sounti, and as far as I am aware it is the only action taken, ie... we are not directly undermining you 'core' systems. So I would argue that the actions taken are at least in some way measured.  But I do agree that that the point is moot now.   OOC. I can only hope that FD put some kind of actual diplomacy/treaty system into the game as it is sorely lacks a feature of this nature, and as all the reddits seem to prove, we would like to see it added."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,jozincarnate,2,Mon Jun 29 07:03:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that would be a nice feature.. not to mention some method of communication to other members in your own power, that we do all this outside of the game is a bit crazy."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,GriM_AoD,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:57:03 2015 UTC,"I second that, I certainly would have been happy to see you get it if it kept a working relationship with you."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,Rolesium,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:44:54 2015 UTC,"To me the question really is this: Following our Expansion into these three systems, and the freeing up of our militarist wings, do followers of Winters really want to be in a state of open hostility with Aisling supporters? Would it not be better for you that we focus our aggression towards the other galactic powers in your region?"
AislingDuval,3bgekt,jozincarnate,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:40:30 2015 UTC,"Two systems, you have yet to actually expand Sounti. No we don't want war with you but we will defend our borders. Would it not be better for you to try and convince you people that Sounti is a step to far! Then we can have reasonable discussion about where we move forwards from here?"
AislingDuval,3bgekt,Rolesium,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:44:25 2015 UTC,"At this point there is no chance we will not finish taking Sounti. However, what happens after that - and to who - is certainly undecided at this point."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,DLM4ever,3,Mon Jun 29 04:48:21 2015 UTC,"At this point there is no chance we will not finish taking Sounti.   Then why are we talking? You have never shown any good will regarding this system. You have never condemned the action. You could have asked to back off from Sounti from day 1, from hour 3 or so, when 5,000 preps had already been moved there. You didn't.  Ignoring it from your weekly objectives was nothing but an acknowledgement that this move was acceptable."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,Rolesium,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:08:24 2015 UTC,Two words. Plausible deniability.
AislingDuval,3bgekt,CMDRtanthanos,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:15:40 2015 UTC,"While that may be true, and I can appreciate that if it is, the way in which some people have posted (maybe its just a poor choice of words) have not made that clear.  At least 1 person made it seem as though going into any of those systems was unacceptable and was considered hostile.  So, at that point, it looks a lot like either give in and pull out of them all or just say F it and go for it.    I can't say for sure, but maybe if it'd been clear up front that if we'd leave Sounti alone you wouldn't fight on Kalana or Kwatsu (neither of which would have interfered with Sounti next turn, they don't share a sphere of influence), we could've gotten people on board with pulling out of Sounti.  As it is, this is where we're at now, and I don't think there's any stopping the people who have their minds made up - on both sides.    I will say this - I haven't even jumped into Sounti let alone done any prep there.  I've focused on Kalana and Kwatsu (and will continue doing so with what little gameplay time I have during the week)."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,jozincarnate,2,Mon Jun 29 04:46:54 2015 UTC,"I agree, The only solution I have for this (in my mind) is for The official condemning of the Sounti problem on your end and the same from us towards Kalana and Kwatsu. Then to allow us the reasonable attempt to stop the expansion attempt next cycle. If this were to happen I believe relationship between us could move forwards. But this would have to take place as of the start of the next cycle. No I can't speak for anyone whether this would be acceptable for any of our powers (I do not speak for Winters), but at least it could be put forwards to our respective groups for people to have there say on the proposal."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,CMDRtanthanos,2,Mon Jun 29 05:02:47 2015 UTC,"Well I'm certainly no official spokesperson for the faction, but I'll say this: I can condemn Sounti in part.  I can condemn it for being overly aggressive and kind of a dick move, in a faction who's ethos does not come across as being aggressive.  It also was what I'd consider a rogue move - not in line with any published organized goals, and as a lot of people know, when you have a group go off and do their own thing instead of sticking to the plan, shit falls apart real quick.    OOC, however, I have to admit that while I certainly understand and respect that its on your borders and you have every right to be totally pissed about it, I also kinda gotta respect the sheer brazenness and ballsiness of the move lol."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,Rolesium,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:17:32 2015 UTC,But we don't need to give up any of those three systems. We are currently winning and will win all three of them. Peace is much more valuable to you than us. Go look at the state of your control systems compared to ours and the total prep output from your players compared to ours. If were were to have a peace treaty it would need to involve a much greater sacrifice from your side.
AislingDuval,3bgekt,jozincarnate,5,Mon Jun 29 05:14:41 2015 UTC,"So there in lies the truth, You know Sounti is the issue, you claim to talk peace, but you show yourself to not really want it, glad to have you in the talks Mr Putin."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,CMDRtanthanos,4,Mon Jun 29 05:17:08 2015 UTC,"To be fair to Rolesium, I don't think he specifically has ever claimed to want peace lol.  He just said he'd be willing to go along with it and stop undermining y'all if you stopped fighting in those 3.  None of us can claim to speak for the whole faction :)    Personally, I don't think we should've been in Sounti.  While its a good system for us short term, and a good trade route, with the mechanics of not only upkeep but overhead as well systems like that are going to bite us in the ass in the long term. Pragmatically speaking, war and conflict are unavoidable in PP.  It's meant to eventually pit us against each other, and logically speaking it's more likely it'd be imp on fed before imp on imp. That being said, I don't like the fact that this is happening right now.  I would've preferred that we do things like, oh I don't know, wipe Delaine from the galaxy first.  Oh and probably take Hudson down a peg or 5, just cause that guy is a prick."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,FAAmecanic,2,Mon Jun 29 05:36:36 2015 UTC,ROFL...Nice Response.  Have an Upvote from a Asling Supporter.
AislingDuval,3bgekt,Rolesium,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:42:10 2015 UTC,"The reality is that we don't have to demand anything from them, and while it's certainly more worth it for them to have peace, we benefit greatly as well.  Over time, I hope that our diplomatic actions lead to great peace on behalf of our faction, and that the main player community trusts us implicitly.  Eventually if any other major acts of diplomacy need developing, having the credibility and relationships to make peace can have us mediating on behalf of our Imperial brethren, and at a certain point that may even give our fellow Imperials a reason to respect us and end the subtle undermining that we've been seeing."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,jozincarnate,2,Mon Jun 29 23:52:22 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Firstly, our pandering to the whims of Federation powers is currently viewed as a weakness by our Imperial allies and is more likely to impact our joint Imperial operations than provide any valuable mediation opportunities. Secondly, I fear it is primarily you rather than our faction who wants such a treaty. I currently believe it is more that you enjoy the art of diplomacy than there being an actual call for it in this case. My wing will not tolerate appeasement to the Federation and our demands for a ceasefire are that it has fair and just terms."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,Rolesium,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:07:19 2015 UTC,"I would agree to your terms.  Of course getting the rest of the player base in line will be challenging, but we can probably do our best to work on something.  We'll probably have to poll our member base to see if there is the support for it."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,SykoEsquire,0,Mon Jun 29 08:47:54 2015 UTC,"I agree, it will be a challenge on both sides, but that's what diplomacy is about. As I said very little could be done in the few days we have left before the cycle changes. I feel the majority of 'Winters Commanders' Would be ok with you guys in Kalana and Kwatsu (I do not speak for them of course). And as far as I am aware there are no a whole lot of us actively fighting those expansions as it is from what I see of the numbers (ask Torval). But I am glad that some of you are open to continuing the discussion."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,Rolesium,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:58:49 2015 UTC,"Indeed, and that there are cool minds coming to the table willing to negotiate in good faith, yet realistic about what they can accomplish.  I think it's going to be best to let this thread percolate for half a day, to hear more input from more Imperials, before we launch a poll to see what everyone thinks."

Don't start wars with too many of the other players at once. Let them fight each other first. And when you do start a fight, pick someone who is already at war with other players."

And I bet that the Alliance would step in to help you if you also worked in good faith with them.  While many of the player base likes the Empire, most probably are indifferent, or they don't."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,CMDRtanthanos,3,Mon Jun 29 09:24:36 2015 UTC,"I truly hope FD has a remedy for those ""Space Gypsies"" who move power to power to solely outfit a ship.

Sure some people did prep Sounti, and if you guys went into a prep war with them, some of us would have ignored it. I know I would have.  But by tying it with Kalana/Kwatsu, some of us have started prepping Sounti too. It could have been a smaller fight."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,SykoEsquire,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:51:12 2015 UTC,"Apparently not all of your faction agrees with you on Sounti being your only real concern. http://www.reddit.com/r/AislingDuval/comments/3b5yp1/sounti_kalana_and_kwatsu/ While the focus was on Sounti first, he made it clear that you all were going to fight us tooth and nail on all 3.  I, for one, might have skipped doing anything in Kalana and Kwatsu and just focused on other goals... until I read that post.  That just put me in the mode of ok, now I'm going to dump everything I can into those systems."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,DLM4ever,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:39:46 2015 UTC,"I stopped prepping Sounti after 1 run as I saw that it was much more beneficial to us to focus on Kalana and Kwatsu.  But since the first saber rattling post from a Winters member here in our forum was posted, I re-doubled my efforts in those two systems.  Winters can have Sounti...I don't know who on our side continues to prep it  (players that are NOT a part of this reddit I suspect).  Even our standing orders here and nothing in them about Sounti IIRC."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,SykoEsquire,2,Mon Jun 29 16:48:36 2015 UTC,"All my snarky remarks aside on here, just to put the question flat out:  When it comes to the Federation (Specifically Winters), what difference should it make to which Empire Power borders our space?  To most of us all Empire movements toward us seem hostile, why should we not be concerned with your current moves and what assurances do we have from you, if any, that the intent is not that of a hostile nature?  I am not here to play chief strategist for you guys but the space that is in current concern is going to be relatively expensive to keep up.  If ""war"" is to be prevented, what can you say or do to make people realize your intents?"
AislingDuval,3bgekt,CMDRKMG,2,Mon Jun 29 05:06:35 2015 UTC,"At this point, it might mean a lot.  It's a unique person who joins Aisling Duval, and you can't expect them to think or act like the other Imperials.  The thing is, we mostly fly trade ships.  Being a transport only power means that if we don't have extra ships for combat, we can't help out any war stuff.  Well, I guess you can still refit with no costs, but Frontier have definitely said they're axing that in the future.  Many of us are naturally more loosely affiliated with the Imperials.  If you get Torval supporters, they're obviously hard-core slavers.  ALD is attractive to just general Imperials, with Patreus probably being the guy for the most militantly Imperial.  Where does that fit an Aisling Duval supporter?  They're either stoked on the mega hottie factor (apologies ladies and the whole internet for the slow demise of humanity), non-Imperial but hating slavery and wanting to help Aisling Duval end the practice in the Empire.  They could also be Imperial but still Anti-slavery, feeling attracted to the philosophy of honorable behavior and intent, when the Federation kind of feels a little dirty.  Case in point, Aisling's Angels.  Or, they're power gamers who have already realized that Aisling Duval's prismatic shield generator is a must-have item for anyone who wants to get an edge over their opponents.  In which case they'll leave when they get all the ships they want outfitted with prismatic shields.  So due to the weirdness of the average Aisling Duval supporter, relative to the other Imperials, it's probably wise to think of us as a bit different from them, which is why we can be having this here reasonable conversation about making and keeping peace."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,Rolesium,2,Mon Jun 29 09:07:53 2015 UTC,"I just don't get the need to negotiate a treaty. I don't think that Winters can withstand us, Torval, ALD, and Patreus. It's what everyone seemingly wanted from PP, a Fed/Empire war. And yet, every time things get even a little chippy, we want to run towards a treaty.  Simply put, Winters can't deal with trying to prep race us every cycle, as an Empire. ALD and Patreus seem to have the combat part down. Torval has been showing they can be very smart with expansions. And we haul crap. A LOT of crap. We are basically the logistics wing of the Empire. We've sort of hung out in our own space, but it feels good to finally start feeling like we are chipping in on the fight that the other three have been in since day 1.   Look at Sounti, Even if they eventually take it, that is a HUGE amount of prep for them to sink into that system. Meanwhile, they are facing undermining everywhere. They have around 7 unfortified systems under threat of undermining and 2 expansion attempts failing. They are losing in Kwatsu and Kalana. And still losing in Sounti.   They are in a corner, and I guess I would feel bad, but this is exactly what Power Play was designed to do. Don't forget, we started at a lowly 7 when this all kicked off. But for treaty purposes, I just don't know if there's anything Winters could offer us to stop us from chipping away into their territory that would make me want to turn our backs on the Empire."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,SykoEsquire,2,Mon Jun 29 00:57:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not really a warmonger, but such treaties will not be taken by people that worked hard to get prep in those systems. I don't have anything against peaceful coexistence, I'd rather see the old hag fall down from power than winters, but such treaties or arrangements should be made before the fact. You have lots of people like me who follow the plans laid here but are not part of any group. Many of them with limited playtime who nonetheless gave a significant part of it to participate in the expansions. If you're telling them they did this for nothing, a lot of them will go see another power, especially since next week is supposedly when they will have had their shiny shields.  So, start dealing with Winters about what we will be doing next week. No problem."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,DLM4ever,2,Mon Jun 29 01:41:49 2015 UTC,"Thats all we ever asked is open communication.  I don't want war either, but we are not going to be pushed around either.  I believe you to be sincere, as with a few others, with the mechanics on expansion, that part of space is beyond our practical reach, it could have easily been talked about as to moving in, probably avoiding conflict."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,Rolesium,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:16:09 2015 UTC,I just don't know if there's anything Winters could offer us to stop us from chipping away into their territory   I guess that made your intent very clear. If anyone had a doubt about the purpose of Kalana and Kwatsu... And then you have the balls to talk about diplomacy.
AislingDuval,3bgekt,DLM4ever,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:10:24 2015 UTC,"Here's my reasoning.  I'm firstly for Aisling Duval, and my ultimate goal is seeing her as Empress.  So making ourselves out to be not a threat to the Federation is a surefire way to keep them from interfering with us.  It may not be as expensive for us to expand and protect ourselves, but it still does take a lot of work and resources.  If we work out something with them, that just saves us even more resources so we can get ahead even faster.  My goal is that by the time the Emperor wakes up (or dies) that Aisling Duval is #1, because that's going to give the greatest likelihood that she becomes Empress.  Also, Aisling Duval herself is a deeply compassionate individual, caring about everyone in society, and probably also in the entirety of human space.  Would she want a war between the Federation and the Empire?  Probably not.  Mainly because it's just a meat-grinder for hundreds of billions of lives.  In the interests of hardcore Roleplay, an all-out war between the Empire and the Federation is a disaster.  Namely because you know that it will be Imperial Slaves who do most of the fighting, and Aisling Duval is the great protectress of the Empire.  All those hundreds of billions of lives will be much better suited protecting humanity from the inevitable dawn of the Thargoids.  And at least among the greater player base, while the Empire has some very loyal commanders, most people are unaffiliated, though there are very many Alliance supporters.  The Alliance won't want to see anyone get too strong, so count on them helping the Federation in the advent of some major war.  And if you're working against the AEDC, good luck.  That group is rich, incredibly intelligent and strategic, well organized, and even though they're smaller, they're highly efficient and know what they're doing.  So, under the circumstances, I'm categorically against war."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,Rolesium,3,Mon Jun 29 01:42:24 2015 UTC,"I like your take on peace, its definitely cheaper to keep the peace.  Let me tell you what troubles me.  I am looking for an honest, non rhetoric filled response (you seem to be the most capable here of that to do so) to this question:  If your player base is so big and many of your militant players will express how greatly, they will crush us if we don't let them have what they want, why is it that YOU don't exert your will against the other Empire powers?  Why aren't you telling them to kick rocks?  Instead all we can see is a forward operating base being installed on the edge of our space.  Why such the weird grad sooooo far away from your space?"
AislingDuval,3bgekt,GriM_AoD,0,Mon Jun 29 04:24:30 2015 UTC,"Well, I think that the kind of person who is attracted to Aisling Duval is inherently kind of a nice guy and a peacenick.  Influence peddling through trade instead of war is my philosophy.  It's amazing in our present world how much foreign aid can grease the wheels of policy in favor of a country like say, the United States, or Russia.  We take the treaty of Cartoi seriously as a matter of principle.  We're still smaller than the ALD group, and if the ALD group went to blows with us, the Torval group would probably support them.  So we're not even the biggest fish in our own pond.  We don't have it as bad as the Patreus group, sure, but we're the odd ones out who aren't welcome in the Empire.  The black sheep of the Imperial family (funny, because that's exactly what Aisling's father is like).  I know for myself, that I feel I don't really have true allies in the other Imperials.  That's tentative.  So jetting off into this section of space is the best way we could still have plenty of expansion, but also not have to worry about getting muscled out by ALD."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,DLM4ever,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:55:49 2015 UTC,"If we are going to negotiate a cease fire, it should be for this cycle only.   Unless we are going to retreat entirely from that area, there is no point for a peace treaty as future conflicts between us are inevitable."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,GriM_AoD,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:30:03 2015 UTC,"That's a point I was concerned with myself.  While we do have the numbers to win conflicts, they are costly to our other efforts.  Is it beneficial for us to work something out with the Winters camp to prevent interference in our further expansions around Kalana?  Not on the levels of the treaty of Cartoi, but some measure of horse-trading."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,DLM4ever,0,Mon Jun 29 00:34:18 2015 UTC,"If they left us alone in our systems of Kalana, Kwatsu, and Sounti, and backed off interfering with them, then my wing would agree to a ceasefire and stop actively fighting Winters."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,GriM_AoD,3,Mon Jun 29 00:22:22 2015 UTC,"To be honest, this isn't even about those systems anymore.  We were concerned about it, you guys didn't care, because apparently you guys are too powerful to care what anyone thinks.  We contested it on the grounds of intent, still no one offered a valid explanation.  The insolence and arrogance, that it really wasn't our business and general ""What are you going to do about it."" attitude sparked this whole clash.  Now this is just a matter of principle, and egos are involved.  Whether we can ""win"" or not is irrelevant.  This would have been avoidable with better planning, but when we are getting kicked around, your threats are drops in the bucket my friend.  Your wing has to take a number and wait in line for ""Things Winters needs to be concerned with.""  From the beginning of PP, I thought if I had to have an Empire neighbor it should be Aisling, based on ideals.  But for now that has gone by the wayside, as her supporters make her sound like she is entitled to the whole of populated space and open dialogue about sharing is not something she is concerned with, makes her sound kind of stuck up."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,DLM4ever,-1,Mon Jun 29 04:48:24 2015 UTC,"Why exactly should we leave you alone in Sounti, a system that is less than 4 Ly from our borders (not even our backyard, it is right under our window)? You called for our distrust by starting and encouraging an hostile move at our borders, a move that started massively from the very first hours (5,000 points during the first couple of hours).  The problem never has been Kalana and Kwatsu, they are just a reaction to your once again hostile move on Sounti. It seems that something escaped you, we are not the ones that started the hostility."
AislingDuval,3bgekt,DLM4ever,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:33:35 2015 UTC,I think you are missing the point. While I absolutely don't doubt that you would prefer us out of that area and are willing to fight to protect your borders - the fact still remains that we are a significantly larger force and will win. Will you waste our resources in the process? Of course. Will you waste your own too? Of course. The purpose of such a ceasefire is not to change the outcome but to just make the inevitable cheaper.
AislingDuval,3bgekt,DLM4ever,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:46:05 2015 UTC,"Then why the talk about treaty? Act like the bold expansionists that you are and be done with it. Or you are still worried about something?...  You are expanding 2 systems far away from your territory not far away from us, with the hostile move on Sounti obviously people have no doubt that Kalana and Kwatsu are a bridge to get on our borders. And then you seem to wonder why you are not trusted and why Winters turn onto these systems..."
AislingDuval,3bgc3f,maxrizk,2,Sun Jun 28 23:51:50 2015 UTC,"Ah, I had nearly forgotten about this feature, thanks for posting.  Though I honestly don't know how to go about flipping a systems government or major power allegiance.. Is it as simple as just doing missions for the certain desirable factions?"
AislingDuval,3bgc3f,GriM_AoD,2,Mon Jun 29 02:52:00 2015 UTC,"It's not as simple as simply doing missions. I've spent some time with a group of -very- knowledgeable players who have been flipping systems before. Here are things to keep in mind:   If the faction you want to help grab power controls a station, grab missions from the OTHER stations. The types of missions have different outcome effects. Doing the more illegal stuff will cause civil unrest status, which can bloom into civil war. Statuses are concurrent: a faction cannot have multiple statuses active at the same time. Doing a lot of trading missions will put a faction into Boom, which will last about 5 days and will prevent other statuses happening, such as civil war. The best way to flip systems is to focus one station at a time controlled by the faction you want to destabilise. Take missions that cause civil unrest. Assassination missions are VERY good for this. Even if you cause a civil war... It's going to take a lot of player effort to flip a system. Keep fighting for the faction you want to help and try to get more players in there. You'll be looking at days, if not weeks of Conflict Zone grinding, until stations switch owners. Turning in combat bonds will help a lot. While the civil war is going, if you need a break from conflict zone grinding, do more assassination missions! Ideally, you want a few people doing conflict zones, while one or two others keep doing missions.   What you can also do: trading with a station which IS controlled by the faction you want to help. Every bit of profit you get, helps the owner of the station. Keep in mind though, that this will eventually put them into Boom status, which might be counterproductive if your friends are also trying to spark a civil war between them and another faction!  I hope this helps a bit. :)"

AislingDuval,3bgc3f,SpiritOfRedemption,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:03:10 2015 UTC,Yeah but you can also trade or turn in bounties to slightly help them as well.
AislingDuval,3bgc3f,Guiron,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:52:22 2015 UTC,Yes. Missions. Also any trading or exploration data benefits the faction that controls the station.

AislingDuval,3bh7ts,domaniac321,9,Mon Jun 29 04:58:03 2015 UTC,"MrCoffee76 here.  Wow!  Yeah that is not what I saw.  I see how you could think this is me running a hack, but I experienced something like this after your encounter.  I am on the Winters' teamspeak so maybe that was causing the lag, but I can tell you I had a guy rubber band across space after this.    You notice how I don't move in the first part?  I'm guessing either you or I lagged.  The second part seems like we're synced because I actually moved.  Here's my setup:  http://coriolis.io/outfit/fer_de_lance/05A5A4A4D6A4D3C1d1a1a1b1b00040n0404044a58f42o66.AwRj4yrI.CwBhrSvGQJnsIA==?bn=fdl1  Notice the shield strength and the ship weight.  I had 8 tons of fuel when we engaged, so weight was below 420.  Also remember, 4 pips to shields is a 2.38 shield multiplier.    So yeah first part looks shady, it could be ""God shields"" but can it not be lag?  In the first part, I ran from you, my shields were low and I was at 67% hull.  Why would I logically run from you if I have God shields?  Second part I had full shields, full hull and light weight and was ready to fight.    Anyways, like a few guys said on teamspeak, I'll have video capture running from now on for stuff like this.    If you have any more questions, feel free.  Regards, MrCoffee76  PS: you had 1 pip in your shield.  I passed with weapons not once, but twice (see 0:48 seconds).  When I turned around I had 4 pips on engines then when you fired on me I had 4 pips on shields, 2 on weapons, if I remember right."
AislingDuval,3bh7ts,rar76,2,Mon Jun 29 05:59:05 2015 UTC,"ahh, I see.. Possibly lag, I can see how.

AislingDuval,3bh7ts,GriM_AoD,-2,Mon Jun 29 06:31:27 2015 UTC,"If so, then you won't have anything to fear during Frontier's audit.  In the meantime, stay clear of Aisling territory.  If we meet again, one of 2 things will happen:  1)  I'll finish what I started during our first encounter and you'll lose that shiny Fur De Lance.  or    2)  I'll get some more evidence of hacking and send it again.  Either way, it won't end well."
AislingDuval,3bh7ts,rar76,4,Mon Jun 29 06:10:57 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to hear Frontier logs internet connectivity.  I'll be here after the audit, and I would appreciate an apology for calling me ""scum"" etc after that.    With regards to gameplay I will carry on helping my team however we see fit.  Is this truly evidence of me hacking or did you catch me lagging?  Another question: why would I run from you if I have ""God shields""?  Also, you threaten to destroy my ship, but how can you threaten to kill me and accuse me of being indestructable?    I'm sorry to see that this game has it's share of ""hackusations"".  I have spent the last hour writing this, talking on teamspeak about this and reading how I'm ""scum"", a ""cheater"", etc.  Personally I met one person who I thought hacked, but I neither accused him of hacking or wrote something about it on reddit.  On that note, I'm off to bed soon - work in the morning."

But in all my hours of the game I have never encountered anything like this.  I've seen lag, bugs, etc.  But this, especially right after our first encounter which was much more on par with each other, and then suddenly my weapons can't even make a dent in your shields on either encounter...  And why Reddit?  I've never encountered anyone I suspected of cheating in this game.  Public shaming is the only tool I've got. And if you're going to hang around a system in contention, I too will do what I have to by reporting your location to my faction."

Not a cheater and deffo not scum. Still, I can see how it might look that way. Edit: Having looked at it again, your second clip....outer ring dims very slightly imo. The FDL can build up to around 800 on shields. Not hugely surprised. Edit....just built one to 920 odd. Might give that a try."
AislingDuval,3bh7ts,rar76,3,Mon Jun 29 07:26:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this seems more like QQ.  The first encounter was definitely some sort of connection/instancing issue.  This could be ISP or E:D server related.  Second round looks like poor power management on the vulture's end, the outer ring did dim on the FDL, but it also didn't seem he had a long enough shot on the FDL to do much anyways.  I recommend anyone anyone who plays online PVP games to port forward on their router, in some cases it can help with packet data loss.  It is not a fix-all, but it definitely doesn't hurt to do it.  All the same though, I despise cheating and if found doing so, banning would be appropriate.  Given this ""evidence"", I seriously doubt this is the case.

BTW, from my end, I interdicted you twice.  Is that how you saw it?  I'm just asking because from reading fast, it sounds like you might have saw me 3 times."

I've skirmished with MrCoffee76 a few times over the last few days around Kalana and have not witnessed anything out of the norm on any of those occasions (other than his FDL destroying my mighty DB Scout, so obviously a hack, right?).  I've definitely seen lag glitches similar to the first one in the video before, and while the second part certainly looks bad on it's own, given that one pretty certain lag glitch had already occurred between the two of you, it seems probable that this was also some lag-induced oddness.  By all means people should be reporting suspected cheating to FD, but people really need to chill on the public call-outs with either poor or no supporting evidence.  Let FD handle it, at least until they show they can't or won't."

Here is a good introduction video to Powerplay  You need to get a complete understanding of Powerplay to get the most out of it, Frontier have also made some good Powerplay tutorial videos here too  We currently have a huge problem as a Power as many people are preparing and expanding into non profitable systems (I'm sure the other powers are having this problem too) so the quicker we all fully understand Powerplay and share the knowledge, the better we'll do as a Power and therefore be higher in the power ranking, which in turn benefits us individually as players."
AislingDuval,3beoxw,chairmandoon,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:37:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the videos, it makes more sense to me now.   I'm afraid I am guilty of preparing systems without giving much thought to it. First, I didn't fully understand mechanics of PowerPlay; second, getting merit and my cargo space back.   I think problem with other players preparing unprofitable systems is pretty much that many of them just wants to earn merit, don't fully understand power play, and isn't engaged in any community, thus don't know what to do."
AislingDuval,3beoxw,Guiron,2,Sun Jun 28 22:42:19 2015 UTC,"Oh trust us, most people here know. That's why I am glad that you started looking here. Every person we can get on board with the coordination here is a step further towards not having to fight against our own faction every cycle.  And truthfully, the difference in merit grind spots vs well placed systems to prep is sometimes only a difference of one or two jumps. It's not hours of difference in terms of grinding, that is what is frustrating, to me. For example, HIP 10786 is 1127% expanded. Just a total waste to make the easiest haul. It's a short hop, but if you made only one or two more jumps from Karsuki Ti, all those materials could be helping in Karkasis or Rishair. Which would push them over the horrible Clido Pi, most likely.  We waste so much potential because people are taking the easiest path. And with just the tiniest bit of extra effort we could instead be doing exactly what we want when we want with expansion if we were ever able to get everyone coordinated."

I just made run from there to Wababa, I'm loading up with materials.   Can anyone tell me which day of the week cycle ends, so I can haul those in the right direction on time?"
AislingDuval,3beoxw,AntheusBax,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:08:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah me too at first, no one should feel bad for not understanding Powerplay in game, I seriously doubt anyone could work it out with only the ingame information to go on. An upside of making complicated unexplained mechanics in games is people go to the community for help, so I think frontier did this deliberately, it forces players to form social connections in the community which as Facebook has taught us, keeps people coming back for more time and time again.... clever devs ;)"
AislingDuval,3beoxw,Pantegana,2,Sun Jun 28 22:52:05 2015 UTC,Fortification of controlled systems can only be picked up from Cubeo.   Preparation and Expansion ones can be picked up from any system controlled by our glorious and beautiful Space Khaleesi :)
AislingDuval,3beoxw,nisanick,2,Sun Jun 28 15:35:51 2015 UTC,"Aisling beautiful indeed, can't say that about Cubeo though. I'm recently avoiding coming back there, it's infested with all sorts of enemies, I get interdicted ridiculous number of times on every visit, sometimes seconds before safe disengage. Makes me want to change occupation. Not sure if it's possible to shoot them all out? Thinking of buying second ship, maybe small fighter with big lasers, but need to grind more credits for that."
AislingDuval,3bg4ib,Guiron,2,Sun Jun 28 22:43:23 2015 UTC,"Another option as a replacement for Beker would be Ienpalang. By prepping and expanding Ienpalang, Beker would then be exploited and become even more valuable for trade. The other advantage is that as they are within 15ly of each other Beker is safe from becoming Controlled - so long as Ienpalang has greater preparation than Beker at the end of the turn."
AislingDuval,3bg4ib,Rolesium,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:57:36 2015 UTC,Kauruku is also another good option off the prep list. I'm gonna go see how much prep is there and in Conii now.  Does Ienpalang have any prep yet?
AislingDuval,3bg4ib,Rolesium,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:01:17 2015 UTC,No prep as of yet.
AislingDuval,3bg4ib,Rolesium,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:09:15 2015 UTC,"Thinking Kanuket, then. Hopefully snag Ienpalang next cycle."
AislingDuval,3bg4ib,Rolesium,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:33:53 2015 UTC,Sounds like a good plan. All three are much better than letting Beker slip through.

I suspect that any thread that is not involving our unnecessary capitulation to Winters is being down-voted by Winters' goons. Actually, maybe I will go oppose their expansions again as they seem to have been recovering while my wing has been distracted with other tasks."
AislingDuval,3bg4ib,Endincite,2,Mon Jun 29 18:09:12 2015 UTC,I really hope you guys accomplish this. An exploited Beker would become a trade mecca - the largest Palladium supply in the Empire by a huge margin (for those who didn't read my other threads on the topic).

AislingDuval,3bg4ib,Howl_UK,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:20:46 2015 UTC,"Any chance you could ELI5 the pros and cons of an exploited, controlled or neutral Beker (or any extraction system with cheap Palladium).  Because right now me and my friends are buying our Palladium there and delivering merits. So it looks like we (and likely many others) are contributing to the problem without knowing why it is a bad thing."
AislingDuval,3bg4ib,Kryfield,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:39:24 2015 UTC,"Very simple. Exploiting (within 15ly of a control system, but NOT an actual control system) increases supply/demand alone,  controlling will do the same AND increase the price, so the profit that usually comes from a larger supply is killed, because of the purchase price hike. You want to control systems to be where you sell Palladium, not buy it.   I have no idea what ELI5 means."

AislingDuval,3bg4ib,SpiritOfRedemption,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:24:41 2015 UTC,"Another potential system we could pump (but only if we somehow manage to get a second bad system near the bottom of the top 10), is HIP 105391, it's a little further out but would be a decent control system (consumes palladium/gold), generates 100 CC and has 7616 prep atm. I had remembered it getting a fair amount of prep at the start of the cycle.  But I would certainly use Kanuket first as it's much closer to breaking into the top 10.  Dropping Karakasis would also be nice (as it's a supply system for palladium/gold), but that might not be feasable since we have much to focus on elsewhere..."
AislingDuval,3bg4ib,Rolesium,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:23:44 2015 UTC,"OK, back Kanuket to oust Beker.  Kelin Samba (which is Top Priority on the Objectives list) and Rishair have prep points almost equal with Beker, so these need boosting also.  If Beker re-enters the list then any of these 3 could drop out.  Karakasis entered the prep list Sunday (it pushed out Kanuket).  This is another large Extraction with low CC.  Is this yet another bad system promoted by the credit/merit grinders?  If Beker is kept out of this week's prep list then it will probably re-appear next week.  Last week it ended with 16.1k Aisling prep points (not enough to appear in the top 10) and 6.2k by Torval.  Shapsugabus was also in Torval's list last week (I don't know whether it had Aisling points). Remember that Grebegus came back last week after we managed to remove it the week previous.  It seems that there is nothing that can be done to prevent these ""grind"" systems becoming Control Systems.  Remove them from the Prep list (with a huge effort) and they'll be back again next week.  Then they get an insane level of Expansion points.  The Powerplay Prep List system is seriously broken."
AislingDuval,3bg4ib,SpiritOfRedemption,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:29:56 2015 UTC,The way to prevent them becoming control systems is to prep another more suitable control system within 15ly radius.
AislingDuval,3be3oo,rdslw,2,Sun Jun 28 10:32:07 2015 UTC,"Good idea. May also want to bring up Hollos, as well. We outprepped Torval there but since we didn't have the space in our prep queue, it went to them. I still think the wording there is a little vague since it states that the faction with room AND the most prep gets the system. That and is pretty important."

AislingDuval,3bdta2,maxrizk,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:28:42 2015 UTC,I thought that was only for control systems? Is the documentation wrong?
AislingDuval,3bdta2,CMDRtanthanos,2,Sun Jun 28 07:32:20 2015 UTC,"no, you're correct. Control systems: increase consumption and production of high value goods and increases price of high value goods. Exploited systems: increase consumption and production of high value goods.  No increase in price of high value goods.    The key here would be not to get the system directly as a control system, but to get a nearby system so that it would become exploited. Unfortunately, I don't think we know just how much Aisling's bonus increases production and consumption."
AislingDuval,3bdta2,maxrizk,3,Sun Jun 28 07:37:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly. With the current thinking on overhead, find one that has the least systems within 15ly, but encompasses HIP 116710. Its the Chretien-whatever station I'm referring to, btw."

AislingDuval,3bdta2,CMDRtanthanos,3,Sun Jun 28 07:52:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and that's the rub.  We're awfully concerned with overhead calculations over at ALD right now, and it looks like 'lower-CC but also lower exploited-count' systems will actually have better net worth when you get larger than a certain threshold (as it looks like you guys will soon).  Threads on the forum about it, math guys going over it, etc. It's no secret.  EDIT: In any case the Beker place I mentioned is even better. It'd be nearly double the highest existing supply (again, that I know of) in the Empire at HR 494, if it doubled. It's 2nd now."
AislingDuval,3bdta2,CMDRtanthanos,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:58:48 2015 UTC,"yeah, I've been mulling that over all day and thinking we might want to try to slow down on how much we expand for a bit and see how some of this plays out with the larger powers before we go headlong into the same situation. The problem with that, of course, is that we can't control the idiots who keep doing stupid things to be lazy and grind merits with the least amount of effort possible. As for beker, the only issue with that one is (last I checked) Eggleton Orbital and Curtiss hub were the only 2 that had a supply of Palladium, and they're 5500ls from the jump in. Oh and stupid people are prepping it for expansion which will not only increase the supply but increase the price as well."
AislingDuval,3bdsst,CMDRLightFingers,3,Sun Jun 28 07:14:02 2015 UTC,"Might be helpful to fill in who Emperor's Grace represents. I assume Patreus? Or is this just something your guild is doing separately from Patreus? Are you asking us to stop prep this cycle or allow Patreus to prep the system? I'm not really seeing an incentive past a CG that will just bring a bunch of what I am assuming will be combat fitted CMDRs right into the middle of our space. Who will probably get bored at some point bounty hunting and decide to grind some merit in either our frontier, or Torval's or ALD's.  Sorry for being a little questioning, but this is the second time in two weeks we've had to deal with a guild telling us we are operating in ""their"" space that we had no idea about. 12k is a lot of prep and it's a good CC system for us. I'm just asking questions trying to find out what's in it for us. Plus, even if we told people to stop today, you gotta understand that Aisling prep is like a freight train. It's hard to throw on the brakes in a short distance."
AislingDuval,3bdsst,Guiron,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:20:40 2015 UTC,"Hi and many thanks for responding.  Emperor's Grace is sworn to Patreus and our Dev approved NPC leader is based in the existing bubble of systems (Arikara, Svari, Rishair, Napoyo, Chick Bahpu, Bibari, Vargerson etc) where a number of Emperor's Grace Chapters exist side by side.  Admiral Brennus is the Admiral in command of the Imperial Navy and answers to the Emperor.  As for the CG we have worked hard to get the Devs to approve this and it will require a complete game update as there will be a rare trade commodity at the end of it.  Emperor's Grace does Powerplay for Patreus and also our own thing.  Rishair is part of that activity."
AislingDuval,3bdsst,Guiron,2,Sun Jun 28 09:48:05 2015 UTC,"So if we cap it the CG doesn't happen? I don't understand that part. I thought PP and the background sim were totally separate.  And why are you guys Patreus when he's nowhere near those systems? What's Admiral Brennus got against the People's Princess that he can't join up if we take the system?  I mean, it's cool you guys have your own thing going on or whatever, but I'd rather have Rishair than Shapsugabus and definitely more than Beker or whatever other crap is down the bottom of our list."
AislingDuval,3bdsst,Guiron,2,Sun Jun 28 10:05:08 2015 UTC,"We are 5 separate player groups within Emperor's Grace and if you followed the Galnet News announcement, you'd have read that Emperor's Grace as a whole swore to Patreus.  Emperor's Grace comprises 91 systems of which 50 are majority faction with 2 being investigated for broken simulation."
AislingDuval,3bdsst,Guiron,2,Sun Jun 28 10:38:22 2015 UTC,"Also in answer to your other question, Powerplay and the background sim ARE connected.  By assimilating systems under various Chapters of Emperor's Grace we have grown each respective Chapter, making the CC more valuable.  Conversely, we are working with the Devs to see whether reducing the assimilation affects the overall CC of an Exploited system and if the sim requires further adjustment.  If so, it can turn a positive CC system into a negative CC system after assimilation."
AislingDuval,3bdsst,Raf_von_Thorn,2,Sun Jun 28 10:42:17 2015 UTC,"In the case of Rishair, Rishair Emperor's Grace expanded into two other systems, the same number as another Chapter of Emperor's Grace.  So the theory we are in the process of testing, is whether reducing majority to minority control, will affect CC of the Exploited system and if not, what adjustments are required to the sim, to then assist the rollout of 1.4 and for that we are using a different Chapter that is presently Exploited."
AislingDuval,3bdsst,Guiron,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:48:45 2015 UTC,"That's all great, but if what I am reading is correct, you're asking us not to prep it so you can make it more valuable CC wise then let Patreus prep it? That... doesn't seem like a great deal for us."
AislingDuval,3bdsst,Kryfield,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:24:39 2015 UTC,"No it's not going to be for Patreus.  As has been pointed out, Patreus is nowhere near there.  We'd prefer if no Power had the system, for the reasons which have already been mentioned."

AislingDuval,3bbou0,maxrizk,4,Sat Jun 27 18:08:25 2015 UTC,"Here's what I propose, if you really want to try to take He Xingo... I don't because I think it hamstrings ALD in a way that is almost fitting for the backstab.  Outsource.  It's VERY hard to undermine within the faction. However, if you were to, say, hire out some Kumo Crew boys, pay them maybe 1 mil in Palladium per 150 points of merit, you may get some bites. It's a win-win for them. They get credits and merit. We get the system undermined in a FAR more efficient fashion than we could ever do. The rate might have to be adjusted, of course."
AislingDuval,3bbou0,Guiron,2,Sun Jun 28 06:19:00 2015 UTC,"Personally I'd rather just focus our energy on the Feds up in Sounti, Kwatsu and Kalana. Worrying too much about how to penalize the actions of our Imperial allies seems like a misguided effort. If people want to oppose the expansion - that action has been approved - I just see little point in creating a lot of animosity towards Lavigny-Duval if all we are going to do is saber-rattling. After He Xingo has been whined about for 3 days do you know how much opposition we have done against He Xingo? 4 out of 7830. That is right 4. Basically no one has done anything. Its all talk and no action. We need to either back our words up or go do something more useful. The odds of Lavigny succeeding as they are already 2000 past the trigger is nearly overwhelming at this point."

There's a reason why you are not marked as ""hostile"" in other imperial power space: they're allies. No reason to target them unless they have a system we want/need ourselves.  Instead, go kill ships of any non-imperial power, and get 15 merits per kill. A lot faster than clumsily taking a couple tons of power-specific commodities per trader.

AislingDuval,3bbou0,GriM_AoD,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:55:47 2015 UTC,Not really. Anything special about that system then?
AislingDuval,3bbou0,Ubbermann,2,Sat Jun 27 19:59:44 2015 UTC,"A rogue ALD group rushed it at the last moment last cycle, it impedes on our borders and will conflict some systems impacting CC income."
AislingDuval,3bbou0,GriM_AoD,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:02:26 2015 UTC,He Xingo is an aggressive expansion aimed at weakening us.  Look at where it is.

AislingDuval,3bbou0,EpicFailCookie,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:23:17 2015 UTC,NPC haulers only drop 2-4 usually you could always grab a few of those if you want to help.. Though I can understand not wanting to with such patrols about :/
AislingDuval,3bbou0,rdslw,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:31:33 2015 UTC,isn't it better to do it in wing with ship that have big cargo space and small ship that do the fighting?
AislingDuval,3bbou0,Capt_Icaro,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:40:36 2015 UTC,That works too.  I usually show up with a multiroll ship.  NPC's are very easy to defeat.
AislingDuval,3bbou0,GriM_AoD,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:06:48 2015 UTC,"i have a question about the hatch breaker limpets: i understand that the enemy shields have to be down in order for them to work, but do i also have to face the side of the ship where the cargo scoop is, or is it enough to just shoot the limpet when i'm behind them?  Also if you guys think there is still a chance we can have impact in he xingo i'd like to offer the services of my asp - problem is i'm not pvp experienced, nor would i have a chance against descent ai anacondas or fdl etc."
AislingDuval,3bbou0,GriM_AoD,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:09:08 2015 UTC,You don't need to face the ship at all. The hatch breaker is pretty agile.   If you start getting attacked by big combat ships I would just bail. Go for npc ships.
AislingDuval,3bbou0,Capt_Icaro,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:01:12 2015 UTC,"Count me in. but please confirm if this is still bugged?  If so, let's report this as a bug to Frontier and demand at lest one cycle delay for HE XINGO. Can you do it? Bug reporting needs detailed description, screenshots (credibility) to make it happen."
AislingDuval,3bbou0,Jpotter145,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:37:02 2015 UTC,"Only two small clarifications:   Spacecat is not member of OCI. Now, that we are consulted by our fellow power members before taking actions, then we could coordinate. That doesn't mean that because our size and capability we must agree with everything recommended by other power guilds and that must be agreed internally, in a democratic way, not dictatorial."
AislingDuval,3bbou0,willdam,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:45:49 2015 UTC,"I'd love to help, but my place for the time being is on the front lines. Hopefully I can enjoy some of this later.  Might I suggest that you work in pairs, even for PvE as Emptying/Collecting from the larger transports is often (from my limited experience) interrupted by security. Obviously higher wing size recommended if it's high cmdr presence.  Also worth checking the targets modules before interdiction as the higher ranked ones usually have one or more point defences making it nigh impossible to attach a hatch breaker"

AislingDuval,3bbou0,SpiritOfRedemption,0,Sat Jun 27 18:55:32 2015 UTC,"ViceAdmiral OCI  With all due respect,   First OCI expanded He Xingo in a fair manner according to the rules of the game and much sooner than  your Rogue Group of the Aisling Duval (if we are a Rogue Group, you are also)  Second, we prefer to call you and al our fellow imperials honorable guilds, but if you prefer Rogue we will use it.  Third, you may chose any path but attacking our undermining our system shows a deep lack of maturity, an a very low fair play, if you don't understand Elite or you prefer pay to win, this is not your game.  Last and least, we always protect and serve the empire but we can not accept insults or childish behavior, we respect al imperial powers and their guilds but as long as their is fluent communication and mature behaviour.  If you prefer to talk this an any other matters like normal persons contact our diplomat in our forum don't cry on Reddit for a personal matter that you could not defend inside the game.  Our forum: www.comandantesimperiales.com"
AislingDuval,3bbou0,willdam,4,Sat Jun 27 20:29:19 2015 UTC,Capt_Icaro - your post clearly shows the disconnect between you and your core Duval group.  You are taking a different action than your groups orders and it is a hostile action against THEIR ALLY (Aisling).  You ARE Rogue and will be dealt with accordingly.  Reddit is more of a sounding board than your rouge group's website.  You need to coordinate you actions with you Lavigny group if you want any legitimate respect.  Until then - can't wait to fry some of your rogue team in He Xingo.
AislingDuval,3bbou0,Rolesium,3,Sun Jun 28 01:36:57 2015 UTC,Nobody accused you of cheating or playing unfairly. But it is an aggressive move against our faction and we will resist it. I would love to focus non imperial powers but unfortunately we have imperial powers acting against us. Mainly your faction. We will undermine your expansion if we can. And if you succeed in expanding I will continue to kill any arrisa ship in that system and undermine it until it collapses.    Lack of maturity? Pay to win? What are you talking about? Salty much?  I took a look at your forum and unfortunately my Spanish is pretty bad so I'm afraid I didn't understand it. But we know you moved here to act against us. Is it such a surprise we don't want to roll over and take it? We are all playing here within the rules of the game. The only discussion is whether you will back off or we will continue to fight.
AislingDuval,3bbou0,willdam,-1,Sat Jun 27 20:46:57 2015 UTC,"The aim of He Xingo has nothing to do with weaking the Aisling power or to cause an agressive act against you. I'm sorry if you take this as an attack from the OCI.  I hope that you don't speak on behalf of the Aisling communitiy because you act very childish (I quote: "" And if you succeed in expanding I will continue to kill any arrisa ship in that system and undermine it until it collapses."")."
AislingDuval,3bbou0,Duanedibly,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:13:24 2015 UTC,"Are you here for any purpose other than name calling?  Whether you intended it to be aggressive or not, it is an aggressive move that harms our faction, which is why we resist it. Look at our borders and what it does to our faction.  What gain does it give your faction other than weakening ours?  You keep calling me childish but you're the one that's having a temper tantrum on our forums.  It seems your english is much better than my spanish so I would ask you to take a message to your people.  Leave He Xingo as it is considered an aggressive move against our faction and violates existing treaties we had in place.  Edit. Since we are name calling I'm going to go ahead and call you a liar."
AislingDuval,3bbou0,svenkall,2,Sat Jun 27 21:47:25 2015 UTC,"Yesterday, we had an incident on the Aisling's Angels teamspeak, where a commander working for OCI logged onto our channel and immediately started asking our members questions about their activities in He Xingo. This was a commander who also shot our members in Cubeo a few weeks ago. You have crossed the line and we are fairly using the means available to oppose your expansion. We don't use underhanded tactics like going outside the bounds of the game and bothering another group's members."
AislingDuval,3bbou0,Duanedibly,2,Sat Jun 27 23:38:37 2015 UTC,"I wasn't aware of that. Please send me the name of out commander who shot you down in Cubeo to have an argument with him. In the OCI we do not allow to attack a fellow imperialist so please, we need the name to clear things up."
AislingDuval,3bbou0,svenkall,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:24:00 2015 UTC,"I haven't personally been shot down, but I believe CMDR Spacecat was. I'll get in touch with you."
AislingDuval,3bbou0,Capt_Icaro,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:06:20 2015 UTC,CMDR Spacecat is not in our CMDRs List nor the other one you mention by private mail.
AislingDuval,3bbou0,CMDRKMG,0,Sun Jun 28 17:43:56 2015 UTC,Well said.
AislingDuval,3bbou0,Capt_Icaro,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:23:18 2015 UTC,While I am staying out of this matter I would like to refer you to your own faction's post on what the official position is: https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteLavigny/comments/3b4d7f/lavignys_legion_position_concerning_he_xingo/
AislingDuval,3bbou0,CMDRKMG,-1,Sat Jun 27 21:24:00 2015 UTC,"Do not worry, we already talk to our faction (Lavigny Legion included) regarding the He Xingo situation."
AislingDuval,3bbou0,Capt_Icaro,-1,Sun Jun 28 00:26:11 2015 UTC,"ok well since I have about 11k merits this cycle, I might mosey on down with my battle conda and kick some lazy unemployed siestaing ass."
AislingDuval,3bbou0,Duanedibly,0,Sun Jun 28 00:53:30 2015 UTC,"Some poor bastard said the same 2 days ago and got reckt lol  I hope your not some guild leader , would be a shame to report and make public your xenofobic/racist insults ""unemployed siestaing ass"".  Easy to talk crap behind a keyboard like a coward. This is still a game and you're crossing the line."
AislingDuval,3bbou0,svenkall,0,Sun Jun 28 04:26:03 2015 UTC,Hit a nerve I see. See here is the thing..I am making fun of a culture not a race..you could say something like a dumb fat American bible thumper and that comment wouldn't be racist either. You can report me to who ever you like and not a single fuck would be given by me or the community..see as you are being seen to fifth column your own faction with your incursion here.  I'll nuke you in game..I'm not in your Timezone so I'll be in game shortly before your nap time..try not to be so cranky...my toddler gets like that before his nap too.
AislingDuval,3bbou0,Capt_Icaro,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:11:33 2015 UTC,"But of course you'll give a fuck , your just some asshole behind a keyboard trying hard to sound like a tough guy instead of stoping acting like a bitch about others people cultures races or whatever a smarthass like you want to call it.   Don't even speak about the community , i don't thing they're a piece of crap like you and please don't put your toddler into this since it's not his fault that his dad is a dumbass that doesn't understand what respect means."
AislingDuval,3bbou0,Duanedibly,-1,Sun Jun 28 08:09:57 2015 UTC,"As a final statement,  Duanedebli, stop being a racist, shows very little of your education.  We were not consulted on HeXingo expansion, again I repeat, your preparation of Sivara was after we started HeXingo preparation so your actions show an intention to undermine us, not the other way around, about the orders of the Power, we coordinate with our members if we are asked for opinion, if we are not we act on our own, in HeXingo we had been attacked by you guys, we reply winning the strategic location.  If you wish, you may continue to waste your time and resources in HeXingo, but accept it, you lost it because you can't accept other guilds succeed, this is childish.  If you don't find an agreement between you and our diplomat, we will be there to retaliate you as the traitors to the empire that you will become.  We don't shoot imperial ships unless shoot first, if the commander Spacecat shoot one of you in unfair battle send me the screenshot and I will court martial him.  The forum section for diplomatic relations is in three languages, we also speak English, Spanish, French, Portuguese and German.  Start behaving as fellow imperials we really don't want to kills imperial fellow commanders while we have thousands of Federal Ones. And is better this discussions in private instead of Reddit because Federal Commanders must be laughing at us right now."
AislingDuval,3bbou0,Pheyes,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:58:19 2015 UTC,"It is amazing to see OCI twisting the fact to justify their lowly act.  I really do not mind if He Xingo out-preped Sivara in a decent way. I could have said it was a job well done, but dumping 16000 CC into He Xingo in the last few hour of a cycle to push it into Top 10 list is  a shameless act of backstabbing while we had a peace treaty with most ALD.  OCI is a group of trash which deserves no respect."
AislingDuval,3bbou0,Duanedibly,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:53:52 2015 UTC,"Let me correct you, we push 50.000 , not 16.000. We didn't have any peace treaty with you guys. You are the ones allied with the Feds so review your arguments."

They changed the quantity though, so I actually have what could be a useful amount. I am saving mine until the week is almost over so I can drop them on a system that might need the boost."
AislingDuval,3bcyrj,DragnHntr,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:59:05 2015 UTC,Each counts as one tonne of preparation material sent to a system. You're best off saving them until Wednesday and dropping them into a valuable system which needs boosting at that point. :)
