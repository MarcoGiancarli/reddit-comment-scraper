djiphantom,3e4ixf,dirtyJerz77,2,Wed Jul 22 01:02:16 2015 UTC,"I think you will get mixed responses to this question here, mostly negatively phrased.  It is something you will need to research yourself and don't just take what everyone says online about it - a lot of people seem to have taken it upon themselves to add places you shouldn't fly it when talking about it.  For example - I can't count the amount of times people said flying at night is illegal. For everything I found there is no law or even guidelines saying no flying at night and there was not a single thing mentioned about my state about it - so I did it and will continue to until I find out I can't.  State park - I believed this one even more. However I was recently going hiking at one and spent three days trying to find anything that said I couldn't...finally I called the visitor's center and asked them and after going through like 6 different people was told it was fine so long as I didn't fly over people and that if it seemed to be bother people (noise-wise - I agree it's kind of annoying to be in nature and hear the buzzing) then to consider stopping. Some states have banned it and some haven't - mine hasn't, I don't know about CO. It went well and the only person annoyed by it was me with the waves of people that had a lot of questions and wanted to watch me (I wasn't really annoyed).   I would say your main thing to consider is national parks and nearest airports (which you can check the map that the other person posted). From everything I found on my own those are the only two things to really strongly pay attention to. Private property obviously. Don't fly over a bunch of people.   Other than that just be safe and you can probably assume - if it feels questionable or wrong, then maybe go somewhere else."

djiphantom,3e04jz,BloodyBrownHole,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:54:16 2015 UTC,Glad to hear this. I ordered it about a week ago. Still hasn't shipped. Does DJI usually take forever to ship things? Or is it because the Phantom 3/hardshell backpack are still very new? I took it out on my first test flight yesterday and had to carry it in the original box. Not great. Looking forward to getting the hardshell
djiphantom,3e04jz,TiddyWaffles312,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:10:21 2015 UTC,I can't recall exactly how long it took but it was longer than say ordering from bestbuy. I think about a month minimum.   Don't feel bad I used my box for almost two months before I got the case!

djiphantom,3e04jz,grallonson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:25:51 2015 UTC,"I have the Go Professional Cases Limited Edition backpack. It comes in a Rush 72 5.11 backpack, which is pretty awesome. If you wanted to use the backpack for something else you can just take the foam out and go.  Plus, it has all kinds of pockets for carrying everything you could possibly need. Only downside is that there is no protection on the top/motors area. However, I used it for two long hikes the past couple weekends and love it. I think it's probably the most comfortable backpack if you are actually going to be carrying it for a long time, because that's what the Rush is basically made for. I am more comfortable with it not having padding on top now and think it is perfect so long as you don't go smashing anything on top of it.  http://goprofessionalcases.com/shopcases/gpc-dji-phantom-3-backpack.html  And mine in it http://i.imgur.com/taulGLd.png"

djiphantom,3e02zv,rivermist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:39:28 2015 UTC,I have one and it sucks. Barely usable is how I would describe it. I've tried looking for answers online but so far haven't found anything. The picture is delayed and the image regularly suffers from massive distortions and artifacts. Probably will end up buying a tablet but for the meantime I'm limited to framing up the shot and then guessing as I go about the camera move. Very limiting and annoying for what I'm trying to do.

djiphantom,3e0f2d,firecrackerboom,2,Tue Jul 21 00:15:18 2015 UTC,"Yay! I can let my inner critic fly free for once.  Let's start with the quality. The render seems to crap itself quite often, most blatant might be 0:26. Also, 720p, 30fps isn't bad but you can do better.  There are some sharp pans, at the beginning and end of some clips. Those could be easily trimmed out. There are also very short clips, where I didn't see much of interest. For instance, you could've gone with the train tracks for a moment.  Overall, I've seen worse clips and editing, but there's plenty to learn from. Biggest tip I could give here; You're not in a hurry when you're out flying and filming. Retake shots if you have the slightest feel you didn't get it right."

djiphantom,3e0f2d,rLanx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:20:04 2015 UTC,"Your rendering wasn't good that's a big one. That's easily changeable it might be the rendering or just the skypixel site causing so many artifacts you should find out which one.  A big thing you can start doing is color correction it can take your footage that looks slightly washed out and make it look more realistic, or even beyond realistic with an almost unnatural hyper real ""popping"" color scheme, like national geographic. Here is an example of a video before and after color correction.  Before https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puc0I5e2NcI  After https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT7-FFE0dKk  It really takes no time at all once you do your first video figuring out how it works. You can do a lot with it whether its just slightly returning the color to where it naturally should be or giving an entire video a filter feel, but it serves as a great enhancer and just fun to do artistically! I use speedgrade as my color correction program, and color correction in video editing is probably the part I most enjoy."

djiphantom,3dyscj,Namrepus221,2,Mon Jul 20 17:24:45 2015 UTC,"I was sort of hoping that eventually DJI (or another software developer) would add a ""fixed wing"" simulation mode to the phantom, so that when you're flying and turn left/right, it would apply a subtle bit of gimbal tilt in that direction to simulate an aircraft banking into a turn.  Would feel much more natural than the sideways ""slide"" that happens now.  I've tried FPV mode and the tilt is far more harsh than I want."
djiphantom,3dyscj,nogami,2,Mon Jul 20 22:05:53 2015 UTC,"This is a feature of most DJI gimbals. When you initiate a yaw in a direction the gimbal will angle towards that direction.

All of the gimbals have done this since the P2."

I know every time I arm the motors on mine it turns the camera because the stick is at the bottom right.  I believe the idea is that this way the camera is leading the turn rather than lagging behind it, because if it lags behind it you're more likely to get the landing gear in the shot."

djiphantom,3dxr9w,jlbphotos,2,Mon Jul 20 12:12:06 2015 UTC,It is more than twice as heavy as the Gopro and that is only the body without a lens. I think that will be a bit too much weight for a Phantom.

Besides that, you would have to run Pilot to fly and then their app to see the camera stream.  Unless I'm missing something. I feel like I have to be because they specifically refer to the P3"
djiphantom,3dxr9w,steve1two,2,Mon Jul 20 15:17:22 2015 UTC,"No way, this is 270 grams with no lens, the lens should add another 150g at least, gimbal even more(an H3-3D gimbal weighs 178g with no camera). A GoPro Hero 4 Black with battery installed is 88 grams. I'd assume the P3 camera is pretty much along those lines, ~100 grams with   No way do I think this, or the Blackmagic Micro Cinema Camera mounted to a Phantom 2 is real.   It'd be amazing, though. I'm dying for a solution that lets me fly something like a GH4 or small mirrorless for video but still fits in my bag / carry-on size luggage.    ...If anything, the Inspire may be able to lift one of these with a gimbal, or the Matrice 100."

djiphantom,3duit3,BigFudgeMMA,4,Sun Jul 19 18:36:27 2015 UTC,"Sure. Keep in mind that I am new to photography in general so I suggest research beyond what I say.  I suggest getting both jpeg and raw - it just gives you a little more flexibility to play with the raw file if something doesn't turn out right.  As far as getting some long exposure and better night shots in general, there are only so many things you can change with this camera. In Pilot, I can't remember what it looks like...I think just two or four dots...either way it's the last button down on the right side where the camera/video selector is.   Hit that button and it puts it in manual mode. There you can change the ISO and exposure. Keeping scrolling exposure to the right until you see 2""...3"" etc. 2"" is 2 seconds, 3"" is 3 seconds and so on...you can Google to learn what all the other value's times are. I took a six second exposure and it worked too (http://i.imgur.com/u3qCxiT.jpg - not the best photo, but it shows 6 second exposure is possible) You will need to be on GPS or at least a really calm day, or both for best measure, because you want it to be as still as possible.  That's really all there is too it to get a longer exposure. You will just need to play around with the ISO to get the best look. I used a lower ISO, 200 I think, on this 2 second shot. You will see more noise the higher you have it at night.  Also don't expect to do this during the day. You will need an ND filter to do any long exposure during the day, but even then I think it can't be too bright. I'm not actually sure how much you could do in daylight with long exposure and an ND filter - I haven't gotten that far in learning yet lol.  That's about as far as my knowledge on it goes. I'm still learning at the moment and for all I know I don't even know what I'm talking about here lol. But that should at least get you started. Really, just go Google and read any photography site explaining ISO and f and all that. It's just a flying digital camera after all.  edit: By the way, I didn't mean Google it and leave me alone. Feel free to ask me anything, I just don't know that I would be able to answer everything."

When you get a chance to try it out make sure to post it - reply to one of my posts so I can see.  Oh one other thing. I don't know if my iPad was just having issues or what, but for some reason after I took a few picture the display started taking forever to show the feed change whenever I changed a setting. Like if I changed ISO from 800 to 200 it would still look like 800...then change after a few pics. It was really annoying and I thought I was getting nothing good. I was actually surprised at how cool and nice a lot of the shots I took were. They all looked twice as good as what I was seeing on the display."
djiphantom,3duit3,SuckerFreeCity,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:37:38 2015 UTC,"Just for the sake of clarity, when you say ""exposure"" what it's really changing is the shutter speed and therefore the effectively changing the ""EV"".  As far as shooting in the day, it would definitely have to be a 3 stop ND filter and a sunrise or sunset.  I think night time long exposures are really the only thing that will work well."
djiphantom,3duit3,SuckerFreeCity,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:05:18 2015 UTC,"Ahh, thanks. I did know it was called shutter speed as I've been reading about it for weeks...don't know why I phrased it the way I did.  Can you elaborate on 3 stop ND filter? I am ordering http://www.amazon.com/PolarPro-DJI-Phantom-Filter-3-Pack/dp/B00WMJDPZ4 this to use. Is what you are referring to, a 3 stop, different from one of those ND4 or 8 filters, or is it just another way or referring to them?  edit: never mind, just figured out the whole 3 stop thing."
djiphantom,3duit3,SuckerFreeCity,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:11:47 2015 UTC,"I have that same set.  The ND4 knocks down the exposure two full ""stops"" and the ND 8 knocks it down 3 full stops.  The polarizer filter it comes with is a nice idea, but I'm not sure it will be very practical in application as it is a circular polarizer and that kind of needs to be set for each specific shot (not possible when your camera is 100ft in the air."

djiphantom,3duit3,Vincent_Blackshadow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:35:09 2015 UTC,"The threading has been fine for me.  I think that the ND8 is the bare minimum (I wish I could get something even stronger) during the middle of the day.  ND4 is just not enough to cut the sun.  Even with the ND8 I'm still at like a 320 shutter which is way above what I'd like to be at.    btw: your photo is really unbelievable.  I would never have guessed when I started flying a phantom 1 that they would eventually get so steady that you could take a 2"" exposure."
djiphantom,3duit3,Cobra45,2,Mon Jul 20 00:48:40 2015 UTC,"I see what you are saying about the ND4 not cutting it. I have watched some clips of people with a P3 using an ND4 and I kept thinking...that doesn't seem like it's doing much...but what do I know. I guess I will definitely just go with that kit just for the sake of having the ND8 as opposed to getting DJI's ND4.   Side note, I really hate how slowly DJI seems to be releasing stuff for the P3. Also...where is a damn lens cover? I read the Inspire has one that comes with it. Was it really that much extra for them to include one with the P3? I don't know why that bothers me so much but it has since I first got it.  And thank you! To be honest I sent it up just as a test and expected everything to be crap for me to just try again another day. It didn't help that my iPad was acting up and didn't seem to be showing me what I was actually taking a picture as (like change a setting and it wouldn't change until a few pics later). So I was really surprised when I had a few that I thought looked awesome...and even more surprised when I saw a bunch of people that liked it. I didn't expect anywhere near the attention it got in the exposureporn sub, so that made me happy too."

djiphantom,3duq64,EinsteinTheory,2,Sun Jul 19 17:43:27 2015 UTC,"Get a Fieldline Alpha OPS internal frame backpack (~$65). Then get some  kaizen foam from amazon (~$25) and make a custom shadow box to hold the phantom and accessories. You will have some extra room and many pockets for other stuff. Alternatively instead of the diy kaizen foam, get this cheapo bag from  ebay and take out that foam and put it in the fieldline bag. There will be a space on top of the bag you can fit other stuff in there. The fieldline is a clone of the tactical  5.11 rush 72 hr bag which retails for $175 and every bit as good according to reviews. You can use the cheapo bag for other stuff as well, its just not very comfortable.   EDIT - words"
djiphantom,3duq64,forever_stalone,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:53:28 2015 UTC,"Damn, this is the answer I am looking for. Would the cheapo bag fit inside the Fieldline bag? It looks kind of big? Is the Fieldline bag small enough to be a carry on for most airline?"
djiphantom,3duq64,forever_stalone,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:36:52 2015 UTC,"The cheapo bag would fit with some work but you would have to leave the top cover foam off (no big deal). I have not flown with this bag but here is what I know; The fieldline is 23x15x8 and the ""general"" dimensions for a carry-on are 22x14x9 so it is slightly taller and wider, but the compression straps help reduce the size if the bag is not overstuffed. Also keep in mind that the dimensions vary by airline so check in that specific airlines website. Most reviews online point that there are no problems with taking the bag as carry-on."
djiphantom,3duq64,houseoflove,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:07:44 2015 UTC,I have the cheapo bag and it is large.  Also it's measurements are exactly the size of a personal item on American carriers.  So it shouldn't count as a carry on.

I might end up having to get rid of some of that stuff when I travel from one country to another, but I really don't care.  $50 here and there so I can stay light and equipment focused is more important to me (because this trip is very production oriented) than a couple bucks or having to lug around / check another bag."

The thing you really miss is GPS on the tablet if you get a WiFi model. Without that, you can't reset the home point during flight.  I'm using an iPad Mini 2, which is pretty good, but I do wish I had picked up a cellular version of it even if not activated on my cellular plan for data.  FWIW, I've experimented with using my iPhone as a hotspot for the tablet while flying and found that dramatically reduced flight range and interfered pretty significantly with the Lightbridge's quality. Makes sense since they're competing for the same spectrum of 2.4ghz. Also, that doesn't help with the GPS issue either. I keep the tablet in airplane mode when flying now."

djiphantom,3dq8ed,Encosia,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:05:48 2015 UTC,"Personally, I haven't had a need to yet. I've heard examples like resetting from a boat due to drift, times when your original takeoff point becomes unsafe to land at due to people/animals in the area, and situations where you're controlling the Phantom from a moving vehicle and don't intend to return to your starting point.  Keep in mind that a key benefit of RTH is that you don't need to have a connection to the Phantom at all for it to work. If you lose connection to the Phantom for an extended period of time, you want it to RTH to the correct spot and not rely on being able to regain connection in time to cancel the RTH process."

Maybe one or two might have been in no fly zones? ;)  There were some great shots and some not so great shots.  Many were over exposed.  I've found it's pretty challenging to set proper exposure when using a tablet out in bright sunlight.  Referring to the histogram will help a lot.  You should be able to make some minor exposure adjustments in post.  The horizon was off on several shots.  I realize that's currently a DJI problem that hasn't been solved yet.  You can adjust that with your editing app too.  There were a few shots where the yawing was pretty jerky.  Just leave them out.  I know it's tough to cut things out in the final edit, but sometimes you have have to make the tough choice to leave some shots out.  I don't want you to take this as me bashing your video.

djiphantom,3dop7k,Its_NOT_Loose_dammit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:59:54 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that the P3 needs to be flat when you start it so it calibrates correctly.   It only needs to be level when performing an IMU calibration.  That's how it learns what level is.  It doesn't need to be level when powering up or taking off.

djiphantom,3dpa4e,keithkman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:23:39 2015 UTC,"Helicopters and planes can be grounded if there are birds in the area.  In fact last month my flight was delayed because of a flock of birds on the runway.  Birds have brought down numerous planes and helicopters.    Birds are also not as big a deal as drones because they're not stupid and will avoid planes and helicopters.  UAV pilots won't even know if a plane or copter is coming towards them.  I'm not going to say that it's likely that a helicopter or plane would hit a tiny drone, but in the 1 in 1,000,000 chance that it happens, the results could be deadly.    We've already had many cases this year of RC copters flying too close for comfort to planes making landings and whatnot.  It's just not safe."
djiphantom,3dpa4e,AntiMacro,2,Sat Jul 18 23:20:59 2015 UTC,"Absolutely and it's ridiculous that you're being downvoted for making sense. If I was a helicopter pilot I wouldn't risk a phantom crashing into my helicopter potentially killing me, my crew and possibly people on the ground. There's absolutely no reason to fly in these conditions and continues to tarnish responsible flyers."
djiphantom,3dpa4e,keithkman,0,Mon Jul 20 15:21:42 2015 UTC,"I think this is all made up. All these drone stories of them causing fire crews to ground their planes. No firefighter, news crews, news helicopter, or bystanders have taken a picture of a drone over a fire. Isn't that weird?   I do think the fed will use these made up stores in the future to pass strict laws.  The first drone ""story"" where it grounded fire aircraft was a few weeks ago during the big bear fire. That drone was reported at 11,000 feet and was orange and white. My guess is a government drone and there was a lack of communication between departments. Again no photos of it.   All these stories are BS until someone posts a video or picture of one over a fire."

I took mine on a chomping trip and always had it locked away in my car but in a cruddy cardboard box so not to draw attention. I've had a lot of situations where someone I don't know sneaks up on me while I'm completely engaged in piloting and it always creeps me out. Once had a guy ask me how much it costs and then later told me he's going to steal it from me. Was probably joking but it made me uncomfortable.

djiphantom,3diqna,L337Brian,3,Thu Jul 16 16:41:14 2015 UTC,"I hated them on my phantom one. It made the drone real ""twitchy."" It made the drone faster to respond to smaller movements and overall faster. But in GPS mode it lost stability because the increase in speed made the drone constantly over correct itself."

I feel like my 1.1.1 w/ carbon blades is more stable on hover, and it is definitely quicker, but my Flytrex consistently shows a higher top speed w/ the stock blades than the carbons. PLUS, dead on with the twitchy thing and totally with overcorrecting.   Anyone have suggestions for good blades to try out?

djiphantom,3diqna,alwaysasilverlining,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:30:00 2015 UTC,Carbon props have less flex thereby are more responsive. This can cause the motors to work slightly harder and the PID's to be more pronounced.
djiphantom,3diqna,Jfuller32,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:44:00 2015 UTC,I got a weird vortex effect on landing with the carbon fibers. Plus a vibration that I couldn't get out even with balancing. I think the plastic ones are designed to have a flex that is a shock absorber.
djiphantom,3diqna,Tirmu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:42:17 2015 UTC,My p2 flys uncontrollably when using the carbon props. I've tried them two times and both ended up with the quad accelerating full throttle as soon as I start the motors.
djiphantom,3diqna,fobrob,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:39:51 2015 UTC,I don't see why we should use anything other than what these UAV's were designed and optimized to work with.
djiphantom,3di20j,Piratedan200,2,Thu Jul 16 13:12:06 2015 UTC,"The jello effect is caused by the rolling shutter.  You see the effect when the shutter speed is too high for the frame rate.  Ideally you want a shutter speed that is 2x the frame rate (eg 30fps = 1/60ss, 60fps = 1/120ss). On a bright day, the shutter speed will be super fast like 1/4000.  To bring down the shutter speed, you need a neutral density (ND) filter to reduce the amount of light that the camera sees."
djiphantom,3di20j,ty04,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:29:30 2015 UTC,"For me, it seems like it gets worse as wind speed goes up.  I'm flying P2/H3-3D/GPH3 white, and at 1080p 30fps it can get pretty bad, even with the softest dampeners with earplug cores."

djiphantom,3di20j,AboveViewAerials,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:25:13 2015 UTC,"Put new props on. Get some sort of ND filter for the GoPro.  Make sure your Gimbal isn't vibrating on the ground, if it is, balance it with a coin or something. YouTube it."
djiphantom,3di20j,Or4nge,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:43:25 2015 UTC,I've found PID settings are the biggest factor in the jelly effect. Get your PID dialed and you should be smooth as butter. You will also need different PID setting for varying weather conditions. Like your PID could be rock solid in warm weather but could be extremely unstable in colder weather. The motors obviously react differently in different environments.
djiphantom,3dez3g,fs454,5,Wed Jul 15 19:18:10 2015 UTC,"You have a badass job and I'm sure if DJI found out, they'd be thrilled that the Phantom was used in a prof music video shoot.  Edit: BTW nobody sees water artifacts when there's that much ass bobbing around."

Per the support page:   The Lightning Digital AV Adapter and Lightning to VGA Adapter do not support USB syncing. To sync your Lightning-enabled device, connect your device directly to the Lightning to USB cable.   That said, you have two other iOS options:   Stream it over AirPlay Stream it over YouTube   I'd go with #1, as the quality will probably be superior.  If your device is running Android, I'm sure the Google equivalent of AirPlay will work, and YouTube will still be an option as well."
djiphantom,3dgagb,StolenKid,2,Thu Jul 16 20:39:48 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately AirPlay didn't look like it was an option because you have to be connected to the same network (or so I read) and was told that I may not be able to connect both on the same network.

djiphantom,3dc18p,macdaddyold,2,Wed Jul 15 18:54:22 2015 UTC,"I went through the same decision making process. I landed on the concept of buying the P2 BUT NOT the P2 Vision. I have a GoPro Hero 4 Black hanging from the P2 and it gets me some fantastic video. I also can upgrade to a higher end camera if GoPro comes out with a newer version. I can also use the GoPro for a host of other usages outside of the quadcopter. The dedicated and  inferior and obsolete camera on the P2 Vision make it a very bad choice, in my opinion. The P2 with a GoPro gimbal is always going to hold some value whereas the vision is forever stuck with an old tech camera. (Just my thoughts) I should note, I bought both the P2 and the GoPro used, saving a massive amount as compared to buying retail new. There are a lot of P2's for sale on craigslist and eBay and the prices are very attractive."

djiphantom,3dam1d,xenonsupra,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:05:39 2015 UTC,"I've never really debated it or thought much about it before, but after reading your post I got thinking... I just searched through my lightroom library with over 35,000 images. I filtered it down to images that I shot at ISO 100, f/2.8 and a shutter speed of 1/8000. There were only a handful of images left and EVERY single one of them was underexposed! this means that for 35,000 photos in all sorts of different conditions, I would've NEVER needed an ND filter to get proper exposure. I think most phantom users need to learn the fundamentals of photography rather than just buying ND filters because they think they are supposed to.   edit: http://i.imgur.com/FAQyGh7.jpg"

djiphantom,3d981i,BoostBear,2,Tue Jul 14 14:16:43 2015 UTC,"I am by no means an expert on solar power, but there are a few problems with this idea:  1: A solar panel on top would block the GPS antenna and would add weight.  2: Even if you could find a way to power the battery via the solar panel, simultaneously charging and discharging a LiPo battery would probably cause some damage.  3: These are fairly powerful batteries, and I highly doubt that a single solar panel of this size would add any flight time at all, even if you could do it.  Those are just a few obvious problems that I could think of. There could potentially be a solar powered multi rotor in the future, after all, someone is currently flying a solar powered airplane around the world."
djiphantom,3d981i,provehito_in_altum,2,Tue Jul 14 15:19:51 2015 UTC,"Even ignoring the complexities at getting a usable voltage out of the solar panel, I think the added weight of any solar panel would have a much more negative impact on flight time than any charge you would get from it.  However, I have heard of people making solar powered portable charging stations while using multiple batteries, if you're into that."
djiphantom,3d981i,Piratedan200,2,Tue Jul 14 16:53:54 2015 UTC,"Let's do some maths. :)  First the phantom. It's batteries are 11.2v, 5.2Ah, they last about 15 minutes or so. This works out as 200 to 240 watts, not too bad a target.  Now for the panel. Solar radiation falls at about 1000W/m2 . So about 1/4 m2 sounds doable, if a little big. Slight problem though. That is best case with the sunlight. In practice, the angle of the panels to the sun will be imperfect, and clouds, hase, and other atmospheric losses will cut that down. Lets say you are lucky and get half, that is still only 1/2m2.   Unfortunately, our panel is not very efficient. The best panels can approach 20%, but they are heavy and bulky. The lighter ones tend to be 4-10% efficient. Assuming you get some fancy, ex-nasa panels, you still loose 90% of your energy. You panel is now up to 5m2, it's starting to get rather big.  Things get worse now though. We have currently been assuming the panels are massless. A quick search pits the mass at 30-60kg/m2 lets assume 10kg/m2. That weighs in at 50kg to power a phantom. The problem is obvious when that will only make 1kg fly!  This also excludes conversion losses, mounting weight, increase in drag etc. There is simply no way to make it work for a craft like a small quadcopter.  Sorry to burst the bubble, but quads are stupidly energy hungry when flying."
djiphantom,3d981i,cynar,2,Tue Jul 14 20:32:49 2015 UTC,"The weight would be your first problem. Using a thin film panel would be more practical, but you probably couldn't get the space required to generate anything worthwhile. Also, I could imagine the propeller blades doing good for the solar output.  There are a few products out there for water recovery. One that floats the drone up, and another that only floats a rope up to pull it out, but they both involve getting very wet.   I've used pipe insulation as ""practice"" landing gear.  If they make an RC version of the Solar Impulse, I'll be all over that! :P"

Any links to those recovery rope devices? I remember a while back seeing a keychain meant for boat keys, that once in contact with water would inflate and be able to lift up to 2lbs. However that was over a year ago and never saw them again, so I would assume it didn't actually work too well.

djiphantom,3d738i,iwantathink,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:45:19 2015 UTC,"Awesome. The Air 2 will run the app better.   Be sure to do a compass calibration before your first flight. The manual is wrong...after you land, to turn the motors off press and hold the left stick ONLY down until they turn off."
djiphantom,3d738i,keithkman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:48:52 2015 UTC,Do you really have to have the phantom on and such before you can even use the flight simulator? It keeps giving me an error. I don't have much room to set the drone up where I am right now and we liked being able to run the flight sim without having to use the drone to practice.

djiphantom,3d7nh2,rLanx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:52:27 2015 UTC,"Definitely a device heat problem. Make sure you take it out of any case and kill all other apps. Heck even chill it if you can before flights. I was flying in 102 degree heat the other day. Had to put a damp paper towel on the back of my iPhone to help. It did. Also, turn off video cache to save some heat."

Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere would be a better choice. I don't even use Aftereffects for grading as Da Vinci resolve is way better for that and you can get Da Vinci Resolve Lite for free and it does almost everything the pro version does.   The only problem with 4K is that some computers won't handle it. But with Final Cut you can create optimised media or proxy media that will allow you to manage 4K video and still export to full quality."
djiphantom,3d66fy,McFreedom,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:25:55 2015 UTC,"Some fool actually downvoted this guy /u/McFreedom for offering up real pro level video editing advice. What the hell is wrong with people? For my part, I'd like to ask what you are referring to when you mentioned ""grading""? I use Sony Vegas 12 but actually, I find that it's easier to work with 4K video in the GoPro Studio software. I've never run across Da Vinci at all, might you elaborate on this post that got you a totally undeserved downvote?"
djiphantom,3d66fy,opnwyder,2,Tue Jul 14 22:57:44 2015 UTC,"Colour correction and grading is the process of enhancing the colour quality of film or video. There are people who make their living as colourists and it's all they do. Colour correction has to do with making fine adjustments to exposure, saturation and balancing the colour of a shot to correct issues and make improvements. Grading is where it gets really fun because you can build custom looks (called Grades) for your video.   When you next watch a movie pay attention to each shot. Almost all of them have subtle colour treatments that are very deliberate and help convey tone. A director, director of photography and colourist all worked together to create these looks. Some of them can be very subtle and some can be extremely stylised. It depends what you're going for.   I haven't used Sony Vegas, but Final Cut Pro has some pretty decent colour tools built in. However, Da Vinci Resolve (made by Black Magic Design) is the tool a lot of the studios use to do this. It's software that is used with big production-specific editing desks, but they make a Lite version that is very good too. Download it from black magic design  It's really interesting when you get into it. Most entry level cameras have colour values ""baked in"" to the files they produce, but at the pro level they shoot RAW. People are often surprised when they see RAW because the picture straight out of the camera looks flat and lifeless when we're used to seeing colourful pictures from even cheap cameras. However, it's because pros want ALL the information in the shot and they want it to be uncontaminated so they can play with it fully in post production.   The GoPro Hero 4 Black doesn't shoot RAW, but they have something called ProTune, which gives you more of the unsullied picture back. It's not bad."
djiphantom,3d66fy,fs454,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:20:07 2015 UTC,"Awesome explanation. I have used the color correction section of Sony Vegas and in fact, I upped the saturation and sharpness a bit in the video I posted in this thread (although that was done in GoPro Studio). I do shoot in RAW format with my DSLR and do my post editing in Lightroom and I do have my GoPro set up using the protune ""format"" whatever that actually is. I've just learned anything I know about photography and video off the internet and had never heard the process called ""grading"". I'm excited to learn about Da Vinci, thanks so much for your tutorial on all this, it's generous of you to share your knowledge so willingly."

It isn't just getting the exemption and you're ready to do business. In fact, the 333 is very highly overrated and presents a whole new set of problems. It is relative easy to get, but in order to receive an exemption for your business means that the person piloting your phantom (or any UAS you're company may own) he/she has to have an FAA approved pilot's license. If you don't have one, you can not fly, but you can operate the camera. The cert pilot can fly your UAS, and that in itself is an issue. Just because you're a certified pilot, it does not mean that you have experience piloting a UAS. It also means that if a certified pilot is capable of piloting your UAS, and the job you have is going to pay 400.00, this pilot may charge you 300 for the hour. Also, finding certified pilots that can be reliable for your business is going to be tough. If your UAS cost you over 1000.00, are you going to be ok with a pilot operating your aircraft without the proper training, because you wont be able to train him/her. Another certified pilot can instruct, but not you, not if you aren't a certified pilot. This 333 is a blanket, but in order for you to receive approval, you MUST have a certified licensed pilot operating your aircraft. Most exempt businesses will say, screw it, nobody is going to know or not if I have a licensed pilot flying, but it will go worse for you because you will be revoked when the FAA finds out. You are basically promising them that you will abide by their requested regulations, and by breaking any conditions, you are running a risk of never receiving a real certification that is supposed to be issued in 2017.  TLDR. 333 is bullshit. It is a blanket. You need a certified pilot in order to receive an exemption, and the exemption presents a whole new set of problems."
djiphantom,3cxeah,whowantscake,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:33:05 2015 UTC,Thank you for the detailed explanation! I have been researching the crap out of FAA rules and regulations the past week. I have a friend who is a registered pilot (flies for a living) and I might have him on board to either pilot the drone or help me jump through all of the hoops to get my license.   Unlike a lot of people I know...I am making sure that I have all of the requirments needed to become a fully legal commercial pilot before I start my business.
djiphantom,3cxeah,whowantscake,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:46:08 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, there are no loop holes to get your exemption. The FAA will only grant you the exemption with a CLP. There is no way around this right now. That CLP(s) is/are to be the PIC for all your commercial flights. No ifs ands or buts about it. There is great debate among people all on these boards about what is ""legal"". Using a drone for commercial purposes is not illegal, but against FAA regulations."
djiphantom,3cxeah,whowantscake,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:55:09 2015 UTC,"So, pardon my ignorance, does this mean if I use it for commercial use and don't get caught, that I can't get in trouble afterwards?"
djiphantom,3cxeah,1Guitar_Guy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:27:56 2015 UTC,"That is not what this means. The FAA can go after pilots who fly commercially. But it isn't that black and white. The FAA is concerned with safety. They don't care if you're making money shooting real estate, weddings, or things of that nature. They are focused on those people who are using their drone recklessly. Such as flying near airports, over people, on the freeway etc. If they find out you're shooting real estate, and you have somehow caused a spotlight on yourself, they will look at your videos to see if you are violating safety. They are doing this now, but it isn't the money that is the issue. They want those operating commercially to have flight operations manuals and procedures. Evade, recover, crash, checklists etc procedures. It is possible that you receive a letter to stop, but more than likely you aren't raising any red flags so long as you don't violate safety. They don't have to know you're getting paid."

You could control the thing through prop pitch instead of prop rpm but this is still be a stupidly complex system that offers no advantage over battery electric.

There is a modification you can make to the gimbal (which I have done) but many do not wish to make this kind of a modification. HERE is a video showing the modification procedure.

djiphantom,3cvbhv,opnwyder,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:31:12 2015 UTC,Phantom 2 version 1 has the lever on the back of the controller (you can use the Naza assistant to calibrate what the limits are.)  Phantom 2 version 2 has a dial on the top left of the controller which is a bit easier to use since it has some deadband.   Any of the Zenmuse GoPro gimbals can be tilted mid flight. However they cannot be panned.

djiphantom,3curtk,NoRemorse920,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:56:15 2015 UTC,My point was that you can't control yaw from a second controller (or any controller for that matter) because the phantom 3's gimbal has no yaw movement (except for a tiny bit but that's only to combat wind and keep the picture smooth)

If you forget, and you receive a call as you're in flight, then you will lose the FPV until that call has terminated/declined. The transmitter is in control of your UAS, and as long as that is on, you will have control of your P3/I1. The same thing if your app crashes. Beware, when flying on a sunny day, iPhone or iPads have a tendency to overheat, and they will shut down. You will lose your FPV, and you should do your best to land your aircraft. Your P3 will return home if your transmitter turns off, or loses signal somehow with it."
djiphantom,3csb18,tester86,2,Fri Jul 10 11:01:08 2015 UTC,"Cartographer here: this is pretty much unavoidable because the earth isn't a perfect sphere/spheroid, but geographic coordinate systems assume it is.   Depending on where you are in the earth, the reference sphere/spheroid used for sea level (which topographic/elevation mapping is based on) is going to be wrong by some margin depending on the datum (reference ellipsoid, orientation, origin, and coordinate system). This is also one of the reasons your GPS may always show you 15 feet away from where you are according to the map in a given location due to projection errors in the altitude change.   GPS uses the WGS 1984 datum, which uses the center of the earth as its reference. This makes it roughly accurate everywhere, but super-precise nowhere. But other datum are more accurate depending on your location. The North American Datum of 1927 uses Meades Ranch, Kansas as a reference point (the ellipsoid touches earth at an exact, known point in the surface). In North America, it's pretty accurate, but on the other side of the Earth is off by hundreds of feet or more.  Some dedicated GPS units can be set to automatically convert from WGS84 to more accurate datums depending on your location, but most devices that use GPS cannot."

djiphantom,3cq0hq,1Guitar_Guy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:13:19 2015 UTC,"I forgot to take off the protective lens plastic so my videos were a little hazy.    I did that too.  Another common one is forgetting to remove the small piece of foam in the gimbal.  According to the specs, the video system has a latency of 220ms - that may be what you're seeing.  It also seems to drop a frame every couple of seconds, but that's really only noticeable if you're looking closely at moving subjects."
djiphantom,3cq0hq,fourseven66,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:31:09 2015 UTC,"I took my first flight today too. Things seemed to have gone well. The only thing I noticed when I reviewed my footage was that when I rolled left/right I could actually see that in the video. In other words, the camera turned as well and didn't stay aligned with the horizon during left/right rolls.  Is that common? I've previously done an IMU/gimbal calibration.  Other than that the footage is smooth as butter."

My girlfriend was wearing it last weekend while we were out exploring and she slipped into water that was a few feet deep at least... I would say over half of the bag was totally submerged in water, and the bottom bit was submerged for 10 seconds as she crawled out.   The bottom inside of the pack was moist, but absolutely not concerning - my only worry was to just get the pack dried out so it wouldn't get moldy or anything."
djiphantom,3cr57e,turn-down-for-what,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:46:52 2015 UTC,Could be a bad ESC. Had the same symptoms on mine after it tipped over and the motors stopped on the grass. Replaced the ESC and everything was fine. Mine was pretty obvious because I could smell the burnt components through the shell. When I opened it up there was a MOSFET burnt to a crisp.
djiphantom,3cr57e,Feelthesonicvibe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:51:37 2015 UTC,"Just pulled it apart. Nothing on the ESC looks wrong. I did just realize that when it's idling (blades spinning but not fast enough to lift off) that when the motor does trip out, the light on that arm will flicker yellow and sometimes red. It also buzzes at a slightly higher pitch than the other motors.  Does that still sound like ESC or motor? Guess it's time to brush up on my soldering."
djiphantom,3cr57e,Feelthesonicvibe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:07:42 2015 UTC,I don't recall if mine was flickering or not. I still think it's most likely the esc. How is the motor when you spin it by hand. No resistance?

djiphantom,3cp32i,OneTwoThreeFourteen,2,Thu Jul 9 17:09:17 2015 UTC,"Looks like you were descending pretty fast when the video started out. My initial thought is that you might have a case of vortex ring state. Even though the camera shows a pretty steady picture on the first trip down, seeing the landing gear several times shows that you were probably wobbling quite a bit. A vortex ring state might also explain why it ascended again (assuming the motors are at full power when you first hit the ground) but not necessarily why you would have still lost control of it after this point.  You can see more about VRS for quadcopters here."
djiphantom,3cp32i,theprez98,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:21:14 2015 UTC,"Vortex ring state:       The vortex ring state, also known as settling with power, is a dangerous condition that may arise in helicopter flight, when a vortex ring system engulfs the rotor causing severe loss of lift. The FAA sees these terms as the same thing, whereas Transport Canada sees them as two different phenomena.   Essentially, the helicopter descends into its own downwash. When the condition arises, increasing the rotor power merely feeds the vortex motion without generating additional lift.   This condition also occurs with tiltrotors, and was responsible for an accident involving a V-22 Osprey. Vortex ring state caused the loss of a heavily modified MH-60 helicopter during Operation Neptune Spear, the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.

djiphantom,3cp32i,theprez98,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:29:45 2015 UTC,Really difficult to say. I can only speculate that on your first landing maybe you jarred something loose that caused you to lose control. But that's just a guess.

djiphantom,3cmyxj,savingprivatebrian15,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:05:00 2015 UTC,"Some obstacles can be higher than the max height - mountains, ridges, skyscrapers etc.  And by going to max height you're also assuming you have enough battery power for the somewhat lengthy descent. It's a trade off either way, whether you set a conservative return height or a really high one. I change mine depending on where and why I'm flying."
djiphantom,3cn9su,BloodyBrownHole,4,Thu Jul 9 05:50:26 2015 UTC,Very much so. It handles super well and the shots you can get (if you really know your cinematography) are out of this world. The camera's light years better than using a GoPro too.

djiphantom,3cn9su,ra13,4,Thu Jul 9 17:24:30 2015 UTC,Particularly the focal length of the lens. Taking aerial shots with a fisheye looks pretty amateurish (imo).
djiphantom,3cn9su,Tirmu,2,Thu Jul 9 17:32:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. However, what about when compared to the GoPro ""Narrow"" FOV. (Which looks so non-gopro that the team actually left out some narrow shots from the GoPro HERO3 promo video, because they felt viewers might not believe it was shot on a GoPro.  I feel like everyone just shoots at wide on the GoPro, leading to that inappropriate barrel distortion at times. On Medium & Narrow it's a completely different feel!"
djiphantom,3cn9su,ra13,2,Fri Jul 10 04:54:28 2015 UTC,Yes it's much better with the narrow setting. It's still cropped cropped from a fisheye lens but the slight distortion can easily be removed in post. For me the P3P is just way easier as it requires no workflow in terms of that.  That being said the GoPro is a very powerful camera and I've seen some kick-ass aerials shot with it as well! At the end of the day it's more about the cinematography than the camera itself. I just personally prefer the P3P - someone might say just the opposite. :)

A few small unsolicited criticisms (of the type that I like receiving when I share my videos... hopefully they're not unwanted :) ):   Your gimbal is slightly off level (in exactly the same direction and magnitude as my own, in fact). You can manually adjust this in the gimbal settings, but you'll have to do it after every reboot of the phantom unfortunately. A bit too much yaw movement in many of the shots. Anything that's not perfectly smooth throughout the entire pan is fairly distracting. Similar to previous comment: a bit too much ""waggle"" in a couple of fly-forward shots. Even the tiniest course adjustments can be distracting.   All this said, this is some beautiful work. I'm not sure why you're getting down voted. Congrats on the amazing captures!"

Words may adopt new definitions from time-to-time, but the connotations remain the same."

I've also never had anyone react negatively to my use of the word. On the other hand, if I say I'm going to fly my quadcopter, people look at me with the same level of confusion as if I said I was about to go kill 3 puppies for my buddy John. If I say I'm going to fly a UAV my friends would ask me what I'm doing with military hardware. From my experience, drone sounds more commercial and UAV sounds like something unobtainable. When DJI stops selling them as aerial video drones or whatever they have them listed as, and all other companies follow suit and another term catches on, then I'll stop using the word drone.

I'm not saying that's what you do, but in general, this mindset of ""idiotic, unsafe new people purchasing Phantoms and calling them DRONES! it's horrible!"". Don't blame the people that buy them and fly them, blame the manufacturer for calling it a drone.   If I said to anyone I know that I'm going to fly my UAV they would go what?! How did you ever get one of those?! Isn't that just for the military?! What are you going to shoot?! On the other hand, I say I'm going to fly a drone, which is what the manufacturer even calls them, everyone I know says oh, cool.  If you want to correct someone, try starting with all the manufacturers who slap drone in the titles and descriptions, not the people that purchase them and call them what they were sold to them as.

I think today, when people look at my little Hubsan X4 and ask ""if I like my drone,"" there is no negative connotation, or very little.

Probably because military drones just aren't a factor in day to day life very often, whereas small quadcopter-style drones are seen almost daily in the news in some capacity.  I've noticed this shift among people in daily conversation, industry groups, the FAA, etc.  Linguistically speaking it has fewer syllables than quadcopter or UAV, and thus is more likely to catch on in common use."

djiphantom,3ch6hk,geezfools,2,Tue Jul 7 21:47:38 2015 UTC,"I use the walkera G3d on my 1.1.1 and love it. Pitch was no problem to wire up and it only took minor mods to get it mounted. I can get close to 15 minutes of flight with an fpv transmitter and battery alarm when I use the dual battery setup without having to worry about bringing her home. It's a bit heavy, but with P2 props it flies nice and produces good video."

djiphantom,3cgaqr,A_Harmless_Twig,3,Tue Jul 7 18:06:48 2015 UTC,"• Use current firmware  • Switch to ""follow"" mode for less jello  • Adjust your phantom's RTH behavior if needed  • Connect device to controller as a camera, not as MTP to limit app crashing/disconnecting  • Use a supported device (or at least something similar to a supported device)  • Watch the video tutorials (the manual doesn't explain everything)  • Google your future problems (DJI forums are great resources)  • Lower control sensitivity to your liking  • Make the joysticks longer by unscrewing and adjusting them for more responsiveness  • Disable all caching in app for more stability  • There might be ways of improving adb connection with some android devices  • Keep your RAM and CPU as clear as possible while using DJI Pilot (it can be a resource hog sometimes). I recommend Greenify  • Consider carbon fiber props (heavier and pricier but more durable, may reduce jello)  • Calibrate compass often  • Ignore yellow gimbal errors for now. DJI knows about the false errors, they're fixing it, they go away after a few minutes of flying.  This is all the advice I've gotten for improving my P3 experience."
djiphantom,3cgaqr,Mememan8,2,Tue Jul 7 22:18:23 2015 UTC,Where do you get the carbon fiber props? from DJI or third party?

djiphantom,3cgaqr,J3gz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:22:29 2015 UTC,Wow thanks for all of this!
djiphantom,3cgaqr,Mememan8,2,Tue Jul 7 22:56:13 2015 UTC,I actually just purchased the P3 Pro myself. It should be arriving by Friday.  I have been reading up on the update process and the app control for the P3.  Youtube has a lot of good videos to help get you a basic understanding of what to be doing and what not to do. I plan on going to an open field and just get a feel of the controller and movements of the unit.  I am not sure how other Phantom owners are about this but I plan on catching mine instead of landing on the ground.  I have seen a few threads about stress cracks on the frames that may be contributed from ground landings. The hover of the P3 seems to be so smooth in the videos I figured it should be pretty simple to grab.  Good luck with yours.
djiphantom,3cgaqr,J3gz,2,Tue Jul 7 19:39:28 2015 UTC,"If you grab it, you'll have a much harder time disarming the motors and it will be super easy to cut yourself. Just land it at not full speed and you'll be fine."
djiphantom,3cgaqr,walkeezy,2,Tue Jul 7 22:25:47 2015 UTC,Ah makes sense. Thanks for the tip.
djiphantom,3cgaqr,Mememan8,2,Tue Jul 7 22:30:40 2015 UTC,Actually it's pretty easy to disarm the motors. Hold the the controller-stick 3-4 seconds down and the rotors will shut off. I do this all the time.
djiphantom,3cgaqr,Tirmu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:10:34 2015 UTC,Thank you for the tips! Mine gets here tomorrow and I am super pumped.  I have used one before and the guy who owns it seems super against catching it out of the air but im not sure why because I deffinatly see your point on just catching it rather than hurt the landing arms
djiphantom,3cgaqr,coadyj,2,Tue Jul 7 20:02:47 2015 UTC,The motors only disarm when the phantom detects it's on the ground. Catching it out of the air is a great way to hurt yourself or someone else.
djiphantom,3cgaqr,almosttan,2,Tue Jul 7 22:27:14 2015 UTC,"It's very easy to catch when it hovers and the motors will shut down when you hold the Phantom and push the left stick down. Safety first, always, but it's very easy to catch and if you get hurt you're doing something REALLY wrong. That being said I usually land on the ground softly with no problems."
djiphantom,3cgaqr,J3gz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:03:15 2015 UTC,Did you buy direct from DJI? how long did it take to get delivered if you don't mind me asking

djiphantom,3cgaqr,nitrojuga,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:48:59 2015 UTC,"Same. Ordered monday night, supposed to come today."
djiphantom,3cgaqr,nitrojuga,2,Thu Jul 9 15:02:31 2015 UTC,"Got mine about a week ago. Never flown a drone before it. Make sure you have the camera facing away from you when you first take off. I had it backwards, so that made the controls backwards. Flipped it over in some leaves on my first flight attempt right after taking off. Also, dogs want to eat these when the motors fire up.   If you ever play any first person shooter games and such on an Xbox or play station, switch your control scheme to mode 3. It's a lot more familiar that way. Left stick is forward, backwards, left and right; on the left stick. Then the right stick is altitude up, down, and panning from left to right.   Also, when landing, to turn off the motors , just hold down the ""descent"" stick. Don't press both sticks down and inward. If you do that, like the manual instructs, it'll try to move to the left/right. I usually just let it hover above me, then grab it with my. Hand and hold down the descent lever until the motors shut off.  No chance of tipping it over that way.   Here is a video of my second attempt after crashing in the leaves.   http://youtu.be/qIug4l3CNQs  It's scary taking it up high at first."
djiphantom,3cgaqr,nogami,2,Tue Jul 7 20:01:33 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip on the controls I definitely will change that and t will help a lot. and that video makes me even more excited for tomorrow!
djiphantom,3cgaqr,L337Brian,2,Tue Jul 7 20:09:45 2015 UTC,"One more tip. Get a lanyard for your controller, if you don't have one. It's nice to free up your hands for certain occasions. Pretty much any old lanyard will work, but I have seen some fancy harnesses on Amazon."

djiphantom,3cgaqr,nitrojuga,2,Tue Jul 7 20:52:31 2015 UTC,"It's scary taking it up high at first.    Yup, was out for my first flight today - perfect, strong signal, medium to low wind, unobstructed empty fields to fly over.  As it got farther and higher it was getting very difficult to see (though the video feed was rock-solid).  Definitely started giving me some anxiety.  However it is Much, MUCH easier to fly than my old AR-Drone, and having the GPS lock to hold position was amazing.  Had absolutely no problems bringing it back and landing manually.  The next hurdle I need to pass is flying over water.  Can't help the feeling it will just decide to drop out of the sky, and my investment will sink to the bottom of the river forever...  Hopefully more experience with the platform, and confidence in the hardware will help!  Just trying to figure out how to map one of the custom buttons to toggle between Live/Map view.  Not seeing that option right now."

Maybe I will go ahead and buy the P3 now."
djiphantom,3cgaqr,nitrojuga,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:40:08 2015 UTC,"Yep. I have a friend with a quad and he was surprised I was able to pilot it so well.

Do yourself a favor and practice practice practice at low altitudes, possibly in a large field until you have a good understanding of controlling this thing. I wouldn't even be concerned with camera features until I've flown about 10 batteries worth of airtime. For me i'm still having trouble getting passed the fact that I feel like this thing is just going to either drop out of the air or simply take of on its own at any given time. I suppose it'll take more time to develop a trust of the P3, but I sure haven't gotten there yet. Getting better every flight though. Good luck and have fun!"
djiphantom,3cgaqr,Gatorus_the_Mad,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:46:41 2015 UTC,Thanks! I was going to start just in my backyard but now its sounding like an open field would be much better.  I have flown one before maybe twice but obviously not super comfortable with it low to the ground.
djiphantom,3cgaqr,canadian1987,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:01:08 2015 UTC,"An old pro told me to keep it low enough that if it decides to tilt and and take-off on you it won't clear the tree line, assuming you're in a field and/or near a tree line, that is. I'd much rather see mine hit a tree, house or building than an interstate highway or major street. 10-15 feet should be a good enough range for you to learn plenty but still not run the risk of it getting too far away from you should you have problems. Of course i'm assuming that a run-away would not include an altitude gain, rather just a horizontal acceleration. Most of the run-aways I read about and watched were horizontal for the most part."
djiphantom,3cgaqr,almosttan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:10:35 2015 UTC,what do you mean by run-aways? do they lose connection with the remote?
djiphantom,3cgaqr,canadian1987,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:12:35 2015 UTC,There have been a few stories about run-aways that I have come across. Seems to be associated with the latest firmware update. Not to scare you and i'm sure its a fraction of a percent of all the P3s out there but its just something I like to keep in the back of my mind.
djiphantom,3cgaqr,APOSTATEDENIER,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:23:28 2015 UTC,thank I definitely did not know about that.  Maybe I'll just keep in my backyard and fly low for the first use or until i get the hang of it

djiphantom,3cdt4i,nehpilot,2,Tue Jul 7 03:18:08 2015 UTC,"There is a known issue with the latest firmware.  It is causing inconstancy with the VPS and Baro sensors.  I would turn of VPS in the pilot app until it is resolved.  I didn't update mine because of the issue.  Will be fixed with next update.  I would suggest formatting the card as well.  Not sure if the P3 has and internal card like the Inspire, but usually a shut down and restart will clear the ""on board"" logging to the card."

djiphantom,3cch4x,cleverquestion,4,Mon Jul 6 22:42:00 2015 UTC,Hold only the left stick down once it touches the ground.
djiphantom,3cch4x,keithkman,2,Mon Jul 6 22:49:15 2015 UTC,"Holding the fully down & inwards will shut the motors off fine... if you do it perfectly.  If the control input is not perfect, you wind up with a drone that is trying to descend, rotate right, go back and left all while on the ground.  Pulling down on the left stick will only make the landed drone further descend if the control input is not perfect.  Also, the left stick down works well if you are doing a catch-landing with your right hand.    tl;dr: To start motors: hold both sticks inward. To stop motors: land the drone and hold left stick down for a few seconds."

djiphantom,3ccm7h,ishootblanks,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:21:46 2015 UTC,There was one point where I didn't think I was going to be able to keep flying but he stopped after that
djiphantom,3ccm7h,xenonsupra,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:04:17 2015 UTC,I'm in San Diego too. I've flown a couple times near Harbor Island and the seagulls are ridiculous. I had about 6 of them swarming around my Phantom the other day. I was really worried I was going to cut one up or crash. I landed it right away.
djiphantom,3cbqqk,trevlix,3,Mon Jul 6 17:55:10 2015 UTC,"If it lost signal or was too low on battery, it should have returned home to the last place it was calibrated. If you didn't calibrate it before that flight I would head to wherever you last calibrated/flew it and look near there."

djiphantom,3cazjc,100197,2,Mon Jul 6 14:28:29 2015 UTC,Since the phantom 3 came out people are ditching their phantom 2s all set up with fpv and everything for amazing prices. I would maybe try and score one of those.   I had not flown anything before getting my phantom 2 either but learned on mine when I got it. I never crashed but had some close calls. I'd get prop guards if you plan on learning on it and keeping the gimbal off until you get used to flying it.

HOWEVER, if you're not going full speed and/or looking straight forwards then you shouldn't have a problem.  The Phantom 3 SDK is available for both the advanced and pro models.   One suggestion is to consider DJI's backpack & battery bundle. I didn't get the bundle, and after ordering 6 weeks ago I'm still waiting for my second battery. The box is also not an adequate long term carrying solution."

And I definitely was looking at buying a battery bundle but I'm not sure I like either DJIs hard case or the price of their soft one...however you're right in thinking I should have that ready by the time my Phantom arrives.

When I'm editing in Premiere Pro, will cropping these out reduce my videos to 720p? Or if I just have one cropped segment will it upscale the one cropped section and my movie will still be in 1080p?   Well obviously if you have a video that's 1920x1080 and you crop half of it off, you no longer have a 1920x1080 video.  But sure, you can scale it back up.  You just lose quality in the process."

djiphantom,3c91lj,gonengg,2,Mon Jul 6 01:03:02 2015 UTC,I was on the fence between the solo and the p3. I went with the p3 because I fee like 3DR doesn't really have there act together. No gimbal on market just one of the things. Also if you look close at any of the videos shot from the solo right now. They are shaky. I also for some reason dont trust Colin Quinn. Once the solo has some time on the market and all the kinks worked out I might consider it again.  On the other hand I think DJI has stretched the design of the phantom shell to far. If they don't get on the ball 3DR has the potential to jump past them.
djiphantom,3c91lj,super-fish-eel,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:26:44 2015 UTC,"Also if you look close at any of the videos shot from the solo right now. They are shaky.   Of course it looks shaky without a gimbal.  Also, the 3DR gimbal should be out very soon.  I'm excited to see how the whole system performs once people get their gimbals set up."
djiphantom,3c91lj,BloodyBrownHole,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:46:26 2015 UTC,I understand the difference between a gimbal and not having a gimbal. There is a reason the gimbal was pushed back and not available at launch.
djiphantom,3c91lj,super-fish-eel,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:04:46 2015 UTC,Of course there was a reason... it simply wasn't ready.  My point is that it makes no sense to knock a quadcopter for having shaky video when being used without a gimbal.  Every drone would produce shaky video... that's why we use gimbals.
djiphantom,3c91lj,BloodyBrownHole,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:10:55 2015 UTC,"Assuming the Solo works EXACTLY as advertised, it looks like a more expensive, worse looking, but more upgradable device with more advanced autopilot features i.e. it could be a P3 competitor if those aspects are important to consumers. Their bigger crafts are meant to be very customizable platforms, unlike the Inspire do I wouldn't say there's any competition there.   TL;DR: Most 3dr products have a different demographic than DJI's. Solo v Phantom does show competition, but personally I prefer the P3's specs."
djiphantom,3c91lj,Mememan8,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:02:48 2015 UTC,"Had a chance to play with the demos at NAB this year and chat with a number of their staff there.  My impression is that the platform isn't as mature as DJI's but they embrace open-source and have a platform that may be more expandable for projects besides photography/videography.  Also saw a 3DR interactive display kiosk at a local consumer electronics store today, which surprised me.  At the end of the day, competition is always a good thing for us consumers, and I think it will light a bit of a fire under DJI to develop their APIs and software faster.  As soon as DJI enables some of the enhanced functionality in the Phantom platform (such as pre-programmed follow, tracking, orbiting, etc), it will be great, and will match 3DR more closely for advanced automated flying features.  That said, I just ordered a P3 Pro."

Converting to the AVI in GoPro Studio will give you a lossless 4:2:2 H.264 which you can use easily on the intertubes and other devices.  If you're working with 4K footage, you need a 4K monitor and a beast of a machine to process it within a reasonable time range. While 4K looks amazing, working with it is super expensive and there aren't a lot of 4K monitors to view it on yet.

Lots of people and there is air traffic in this area, though not as low as I fly.   So I go way off to the side trails where I have some line of site out of that way and try not to get to close. The times I got close it was 6am, not a lot of people. Other times was sunset and I didn't fly near the Observatory because it's just packed with guest and didn't want an accident.   Hollywood sign is okay but it's the one I was worried about. Went during a weekday afternoon just to be safe of crowds made sure I didn't fly above 400 feet or that far put because of air traffic. (I know a lot of pilots who come way to close or low to the sign) I work in TV/Movies and when we do ground work here we have to get permits. We then meet up with rangers, get driven up, etc... But when it comes to YouTube stuff and drones I've been told by rangers that the subsidiary that owns the rights for filming it isn't going after individuals or YouTubers. They are more concerned with companies filming there without permits. But I'm sure this would change if someone crashes or damages part of the sign."

djiphantom,3c17uu,kanashto,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:48:09 2015 UTC,"First off ,check the rules in your area. I know here you cannot go above 120m (400') without contacting air traffic control, or getting the local airspace closed (not, in fact, hard to do).  As for the range, laterally, it can do it, it might be against the rules, but I've known someone manage over 3km. Vertically it can do it, but it is a bad idea. From that height, the low battery auto land won't work well, it could also be lethal if it failed and fell. If you can cover the rule and safety issues properly, go for it, but make sure you are safe.  As for control range. There is an app for android that lets you turn up the transmission power. At full power (100mW vs 5mW) it will likely breach rf rules but will give you the required range."
djiphantom,3c17uu,cynar,0,Sat Jul 4 10:38:51 2015 UTC,Where is here?  USA?  Care to cite a regulation (not a guidance) for that 400' figure?
djiphantom,3c17uu,notacahp,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:08:19 2015 UTC,"UK. The CAA requires either line of site, sense and avoid, or segregated airspace.  No multicopter has sufficient sense and avoid so that only leaves line of site or segregated. Line of site is defined at 500m horizontally, and 400' vertically. It is listed under ""Airspace and Avoiding Collisions"" here: http://www.caa.co.uk/default.aspx?CATID=1995  The other option is to apply to close the airspace to other aircraft. Friends of mine have used this for balloon launches or Laser light shows before and it is not that hard.  The US rules are obviously different, but most are common sense based, once you look at them, so likely similar."
djiphantom,3c17uu,cynar,-1,Sat Jul 4 18:28:56 2015 UTC,"It's dangerous to go that high because it's in airpsace used by airplanes and managed by your country's air traffic control agency.  Apart from that, you are linked to the Phantom over WiFi which has good range through clear air, but 1000m is really pushing it. You may lose control of the Phantom."

djiphantom,3bvumm,grallonson,2,Thu Jul 2 19:20:07 2015 UTC,To be clear: the metal threading  has worn out on the nut inside blade? In mid flight? I am surprised. Are you flying through actual cotton candy clouds? That might stress the blades.
djiphantom,3bvumm,funkypiano,2,Thu Jul 2 17:38:32 2015 UTC,Metal threaded blades shouldn't be used on the P3 in general because of the risk that they'll come loose with active motor braking.
djiphantom,3bvumm,fourseven66,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:52:01 2015 UTC,Correct. Two of the blades have stripped already. I've done nothing out of the ordinary during my flights and know how to properly put the blades on the Phantom. On the inside of both stripped blades you can see that it's turned black unlike the unstripped ones that are still white.
djiphantom,3bvumm,Aheee,2,Thu Jul 2 20:48:53 2015 UTC,"As someone quite experienced in fastening science, this does not sound possible unless you were tightening the propeller beyond its elastic point and destroying the threads prior to flight, or causing the props to meet resistance to the point that the threaded stud on the motor drives into the propeller at a torque greater than the yield of the threads (crashing?). You should only be tightening the prop hand tight, without the tool, maybe 2-3Nm if I had to guess."
djiphantom,3bvumm,dirty_spoon_merchant,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:18:58 2015 UTC,Both blades were the ones that came in the box with the Phantom.

I do not even tighten my blades any more, I simply spin them until they catch.  The initial engine start snugs them to the correct tightness. Zero problems after about 20-25 flights, still using the original blades and they look pristine."

What I'd suggest is, when taking off ensure that the camera is well clear of the ground, ensure the retainer is taken off and ensure you removed the little foam thing on the back of the gimbal. (Where it connects to the quad, has a big red thing saying remove before flight.)  These are what seem to be common problems, however ensure that app and firmware are up to date, and that there's no dirt/dust in your gimbal motors (Compressed air works well, like £5 for a bottle and it will come in useful. Wouldn't leave without it.)  Otherwise I cannot really think of anything, it could be possible you received a faulty gimbal? Could happen to anyone."

With automation playing a big factor now we will see many new rules and regulations come into play that will impact this in many ways that we can predict and not predict.  Ya, good for the people to get pictures of the idiot who just committed battery or assault(depends on legal definition) on a bystander.

I recommend twixtor for this in AE. (you can piratebay it instead of paying $600)   at 00:59 your copter starts to make a move to the right and then cuts to the next shot in the middle of the pan. Cut that out, keep your shots steady in one general direction (another effect in premiere and AE called Warp Stabilizer is magical. USE WARP STABILIZER. IT'S GR8) Also don't be afraid to just let it sit still. If you have some stuff moving in the frame this will help it look more interesting.  From 00:33 to 00:38 was a great shot, trimming the unnecessary flight adjustments will help your vids look even better. If you want some more advice or wanna chew me out, just remember I'm here to help!"
djiphantom,3bkqyq,OfficerUlcer,2,Tue Jun 30 01:52:50 2015 UTC,"This is a fantastic response, thank you! This is what I was hoping for but completely not expecting.  That first shot you mentioned was my favorite :) - wasn't sure if I ruined it with the speedup to the little boat ferry thing right after it and had a big debate with myself on that lol.  I am actually just now relearning Premiere. I played around with it a lot when I was younger and did a couple weddings - really simple, mostly static shots and nothing too complex. When I made this video I was determined to put it to the music and started to run out of footage, so that's mostly why I had a few cuts in the middle of a pan.   I was wondering about letting it sit still. I had a great static shot showing a boat going under the bridge and cars moving on top, but I didn't feel like it fit well with the rest of the tempo of the video.  One thing you may be able to specifically help me with is output. I noticed it didn't like a few things I slowed down as well, and some artifacts in the grass in a sped up part. I'm currently using settings one recommended on a site for exporting for YouTube and tweaked them a little to get it to where it was - my first three attempts looked horrible compared to what I posted.  I am wondering if this may be the cause of it - (this is kind of embarrassing) I built this video entirely in a project timeline. Only after I spent a few hours putting it together did I realize I should have built it in a sequence. My next mistake was creating a sequence with HDV 1080i and 29.97 fps. This was shot in 60fps. Then I copy and pasted my entire timeline from the project into the sequence and it let me (I am not sure why, it wont let you drop a video that doesn't match into a sequence, but it let me copy/paste into it). I then exported it from here. When all was said and done I realized all of that but already had a copy on YouTube. Would that have caused the output issues?  Phew, sorry for the long response. You probably didn't know you were opening yourself up for that when you commented! (more questions for you probably too, if you're up for it...about AE mostly)"
djiphantom,3bkqyq,OfficerUlcer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:24:52 2015 UTC,"No worries!   I made video my life’s work and I love everything that encompasses it, including talking aboot it with strangers on the intertubes. (I don’t claim to be an expert on video nor do I know everything, but I’m confident in my skillz)  I’m not sure what your camera is but using the GoPro studio is the simplest way to convert your files into mpeg2 which Avid, Premiere and Final Cut enjoy chopping. After that just import your footage to a bin and then drag a clip onto the sequence icon somewheres and it will automatically make a new sequence with the settings synced to the footage.  I’d recommend sticking to one frame rate just cause it’s easier.   I do believe that Youtube just uses their own version of the H.264 codec so if you export it into that and wrap it in the .mov file, you should be able to play it on all devices and upload to Youtube easily. (might take longer to upload but you won’t compress it as much and help with the grass artifacts)   You can also chop the song up to suit your needs. I like to cut the song so that the end of the song is still at the end of the vid, but I’ve cut out some stuff in the middle either in a natural pause or just noodled around fading it until it works.   It’s dangerous to go alone!

The problem is most likely with the controller (mine has issues staying connected to android adb) but if its not it could be more fixable.

djiphantom,3bfzcd,MonsieurAnon,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:06:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the P3P isn't an ideal solution for this type of work. You're far better off using a decent camera, on a Phantom 2.  Photoscan determines the alignment of the inputs by comparing points in each image. Knowing the camera's location when it shoots speeds up the alignment stage of processing, but it doesn't help much more than that."
djiphantom,3bfzcd,chiliedogg,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:19:47 2015 UTC,"GIS/remote sensing guy here!   For that price point you're pretty much SOL. Geospatial software is very advanced with a pretty small market, so it's very, very expensive.   If you want something dead-simple for use with a Phantom, you could look into Pix4D's software. The basic version to see the models is actually free, as is the app to automate the image capture and georeference at higher precision than the jpeg metadata from the images.   But the software for actually doing anything with the maps and models is like 8 grand.   I've done some basic georeferencing stuff with ArcGIS and ERDAS Imagine, but in both cases is because I already had the software.   An ArcGIS ArcInfo license is 12 grand, and I had to georeference manually after making mosaics in Photoshop.   Edit: and if you're in the US it's illegal for commercial use. I know Fluor Corporation just got an exemption from the FAA for LIDAR scanning from drones, but I don't even want to know what that process cost."

The P3 and P2V+ both have a 1/2.3"" sensor. If you put them side-by-side and took the same photo with the same settings, the P2V+ would produce a higher resolution image, but it would also be more grainy."
djiphantom,3bgpbd,Encosia,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:13:24 2015 UTC,True. I'm no camera expert. Thanks for the input.
djiphantom,3bgpbd,MonsieurAnon,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:15:03 2015 UTC,"The grain and resolution are reflections of a few things: ISO (light sensitivity), aperture size (the hole the light comes in), shutter speed (how long light comes in), and the size of the sensor.  Obviously, long shutter times aren't practical from a moving, flying aircraft, and the aperture is pretty wide, because the benefits outweigh the negatives here ... but the ISO sensitivity typically ends up being the root cause. On a bright sunny day, you're not going to get much grain on either camera, at 12mpx or 14mpx ... but have a look at a photo taken in low light. The ISO will automatically go up, and grain will go crazy.  Compare that shot to a photo taken at night with a serious camera..."

The auto light metering and easy adjust are great, but the stills resolution looks like it came from a cheap camera."
djiphantom,3bgpbd,xenonsupra,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:59:05 2015 UTC,"It's kind of silly to complain about quality when you're not taking advantage of the best still photo feature on the P3...

djiphantom,3bexuj,newDroner,2,Sun Jun 28 16:40:57 2015 UTC,"FPV setups typically use a wireless 2.4ghz system that transmits video to a receiver, then the goggles are plugged into that via composite video.  This differs from the Phantom's integrated video/telemetry/control signal in that it has effectively zero latency (to the Phantom's 220ms), which is very important if you're doing any kind of low-and-fast flying like racing.  It's entirely possible to attach goggles to your Phantom.  There's the self-contained Android device option, and the HDMI/Lightning option.  However both are significantly more expensive than the goggles most people use for FPV.  So I guess the short answer is that you can, but it's expensive and your performance won't be adequate to do the kind of flying that most people like to do with FPV.  Edit: It occurs to me that you could actually use an MHL or Lightning adapter to output HDMI from your device, but I'm not sure if that would incur any additional latency or loss of quality, and it would depend heavily on what kind of port availability your device has.  For example the Lightning adapter has a passthrough, but I don't know if that would accept the incoming signal from the controller, or if it's just for charging. On an Android device, I suppose it would depend on whether or not your MHL adapter had a USB passthrough.  Some Android devices also have HDMI-out, which would greatly simplify the whole operation."

djiphantom,3b99zs,TheAndrewSpence,2,Sat Jun 27 14:07:24 2015 UTC,I maxed out the saturation levels but it doesn't seem to have the same kind of pop that your sample has.  I'll have to play around with the other color correction options for fun and see what I come up with.  Here is what I have so far.  *Edit: I might have to try starting from the beginning and adjust the colors in the source videos instead of the post tilt shift stage...
djiphantom,3b99zs,For_A_Dollar,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:17:52 2015 UTC,"That helped a little bit! Maybe try and move your tilt shift along the road.

djiphantom,3b99zs,WD-4O,2,Sat Jun 27 07:41:21 2015 UTC,"Phantoms are capable of autonomous flight, I find calling them a drone because of this very appropriate.  If it can't fly on its own I call it an RC aircraft.  I call my Phantom a drone and many people I talk to call it a drone."
djiphantom,3b99zs,davidverner,2,Sun Jun 28 08:02:29 2015 UTC,Why? I've never considered drone to have a bad connotation. I and everybody I know calls my p3 a drone all the time and nobody has reacted negatively to that usage. What do you think they should be called?
djiphantom,3b99zs,Mememan8,-2,Sat Jun 27 08:39:29 2015 UTC,"Dont overly think this needs to be covered again, but if you insist...  You, me, my friends and anyone who knows anything about multicopters doesnt see or have a problem with the word 'drone' because we actually know what they are and what the media tells us they are. The media has put a very negative spin on the word 'drone', and when the general public hears people are flying ' drones ' down at there local park/field or where ever they tend to flip there lid for no justifiable reason at all purely because of the bad connotations associated with the word.  If someone was to tell those exact same members of the public that people were flying remote controlled helicopters/multicopters or rotors or anything 'RC' related you can understand that is taken better.   Even though i said dont call them drones, and then just now said that if we say it it doesnt mean anything negative. That is not so much as a contradiction as it is getting into a habit of calling it by a friendlier name.   Plus your phantom has multiply rotors... you know multirotor.. or it actually has 4, quad if you will.."
djiphantom,3b99zs,WD-4O,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:30:21 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but my perspective has always been that I shouldn't have to change the way I refer to things because of media sensationalism; I feel like that legitimizes it more.

djiphantom,3b8oxq,whowantscake,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:28:50 2015 UTC,"I am just a hobbyist. Before taking off, I look around the area to make sure there are no people or obstacles in my vicinity. I also check my propellors to make sure nothing is damaged. Right after I take off, I fly about 20ft away and rotate the craft to make sure it's location is correct in relation to the recorded home point. That's about it."
djiphantom,3b8oxq,StolenKid,-1,Sat Jun 27 00:01:38 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to sound like I am critiquing your preflight safety procedures, but we are all here to learn aren't we? I would suggest adding/improving your pfop. They could use some help. Certainly if you are checking for obstacles, you should find a radius that you're willing to walk to verify safety. Rangefinders help too if you don't want to walk far, at least its better than nothing. Your props are rated for about 80 flight uses if you're operating an Inspire 1, and most likely a P3, but check your manual. It doesn't matter if they look good, after 80 flights, replace them. This incident is a lesson learned that you should notate in your flight log. It may not be anything  of a big deal today, but it could have been a big problem. It is best to learn from your mistakes and keep it logged so that you can understand how to deal with situations before/while in flight/and after. Just my two cents."
djiphantom,3b8oxq,whowantscake,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:39:17 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the advice and I am here to learn just as most of the others on this sub most likely are, which is why I shared the video.

Thanks for the heads up."
djiphantom,3b840j,boristhebulldog,2,Fri Jun 26 19:00:10 2015 UTC,That sounds a lot like what happens when a quadcopter becomes a tricopter. Were all four props attached to their motors when you recovered it?

djiphantom,3b840j,chiliedogg,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:27:09 2015 UTC,Several key questions here that you've got to answer. What preflight procedures did you take before you launched? Had you flown the aircraft in weather like this before? Had you flown it earlier that day? Did you cycle out your batteries? Did you calibrate the compass before the flight? Did you check your props thoroughly? How many flights have you flown with those props? Had you checked your motors for excessive heat? Do you notate the temp every time you fly? Keeping a flight log after your flights is very important.
djiphantom,3b7j1j,DoubleOhS7evin,3,Fri Jun 26 16:30:15 2015 UTC,"If you plan to share your video with others, 4k is still nice to have. Even on 2560x1600 monitors (e.g. Dell UltraSharp 30""), YouTube will stream a very noticeably sharper 1440p version for 4k uploads. You'll also be future proofed as people (maybe including yourself) buy 4k displays as they continue dropping in price.  Also, one thing I wasn't aware of until after I bought my P3P is that a 4k camera actually takes better 1080p video too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIf9h2Gkm_U"
djiphantom,3b7j1j,Encosia,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:55:22 2015 UTC,"a 4k camera actually takes better 1080p video    Do you have a source for this? I'm curious because I've seen it posted a couple of places, but there's also a convincing counter-argument, which is that both Phantoms use the same image sensor, and the only difference is processing hardware.  And if they didn't use the same sensor, the 1080p would be superior because it would be the same physical size but have fewer pixels."

djiphantom,3b7j1j,Encosia,2,Fri Jun 26 19:14:39 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely true. This is why we use, for example, the RED line of cameras for production here in LA. 4K and higher gives you a better 1080p image when your ultra detailed footage is squished down to a smaller frame. Details are more pronounced. It also gives you cropping and reframing abilities where you have the ability to pull in, fix crooked horizons, etc in post.   The idea is almost never to output a 4K finished product, it's more of the editing leeway you get and the extra detail you gain by using a 4K source. This is why I cringe whenever someone on here goes ""nobody has 4K TVs so there's no reason for me to be shooting 4K""."
djiphantom,3b7j1j,fs454,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:40:22 2015 UTC,Oh absolutely. Shooting in 4K for flexibility totally makes sense to me.

If you buy the Pro, you'll have to pay full price for those in the future. 2 - If you're not a professional videographer, the Pro isn't worth the extra money. I've found that it's much easier to impress friends and family with still photos than to keep their attention for a 20 minutes long flight video. The Advanced and Pro have the same photo quality, so you're saving money there."

I noticed that the battery I was using would not charge all the way... the 4th bar would blink, but not charge all the way to stay solid green, so I thought that might have had something to do with it.

I just picked up a P3 Pro to keep in my bag as it's invaluable to have on set or in doc-style situations for impromptu aerials. We're shooting a series of pool parties around the country for a massive pop artist next month and are bringing a P3 along to capture aerial wides (insured and not over people, mind you!) as it's the best footage you can get from the air and still have it fit in carryon luggage.

Wildfires that involve aerial plane/chopper support are some of the scariest conditions to spot a drone in for them. Happens often enough that more then 2 people had stories about it. Both personal or friend of a friend. Perhaps in the future Fire Departments and DJI's satellite GPS software can setup temporary no fly paths for water dump routes.

Self repair is difficult for the p3 because of a current lack of certain replacement parts (which Are coming according to the suppliers I've talked to, but it's taking a minute) and a consolidations of the internal electronics. As far as I'm aware repairs and replacements are no longer being shipped off to China, but it's still a several week turnaround  The 3dr solo has some real security issues being raised and it's a worse value for the money.

djiphantom,3b2hvz,Iwasgonnaeatthat,0,Thu Jun 25 14:13:10 2015 UTC,"For the safety of yourself, the people around you, and your Phantom - Get prop guards!!!  A few people will cry about some mumbo-jumbo air turbulence, but the fact is that when you weigh worst case vs worst case, its pretty clear the prop guards are TOTALLY worth it.  SummitLink has some decent clip-on ones if you're worried about fitting your phantom into a carry case."

However, that should be weighed against what could go wrong without them (which is much worse).  Also, look up the definition of mumbo jumbo -- it's language that causes confusion or bewilderment.  And yes, i believe in proven science, but i also believe that throwing scientific terms at people can sometimes confuse them enough to override common sense."
djiphantom,3b39hc,crazycoala,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:45:03 2015 UTC,"The Hero 4 Black is honestly leaps and bounds above the Hero 3+ Black. Shooting 4K @24p on it for a project you're mastering in 1080 results in some really, really sharp looking footage, and it is much easier to pull a professional looking image out of the 4. For what it's worth, I have a QAV400 with an H3-3D and it handles the Hero 4 without any balancing, although it is indeed heavier. I've heard double sided-taping a dime to the right side gimbal motor opposite the GoPro offers more balance, as does taking the Hero4 battery out and running strictly USB power(just remember to cut before you power the craft down).  The rental cost shouldn't be too much more for the 4 Black vs the 3+ Black, right? It's not to be said that you couldn't nail what you need to get with the 3, but I've found the sensor just resolves an overall better image with the 4, beyond just resolution."
djiphantom,3b39hc,fs454,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:38:35 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for this. The rental cost is pretty much the same between the two, so it's not a financial decision, more in terms of practicality. I think I'll go for the 4 and do what you said with the battery and the dime. Are you running any sort of FPV setup with your Hero 4? I assume that the 4 should work with the setup I have with the 3 (using the usb out on the H3-3D)."
djiphantom,3b39hc,fs454,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:39:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, FPV out via USB works the same with the 4. I'd try the dime first, but not both solutions at the same time. I feel like no battery is riskier but brings the weight more in line with the Hero 3."
djiphantom,3b39hc,SicEmRodz13,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:09:23 2015 UTC,have you had any issues with flying just off USB power?
djiphantom,3b39hc,fs454,2,Sat Jun 27 04:13:00 2015 UTC,"I personally haven't, but I usually used the dime trick instead of doing that. I'd imagine as long as you cut the camera before you cut power after landing, you're okay. Granted my QAV has a secondary FPV camera not on the gimbal so if it were to power down unexpectedly, i was safe. I'd try just the dime trick first.   I've since moved on and am now shooting with a Phantom 3 Pro as I couldn't get over how much longer the Phantoms stay in the air vs my heavy ass QAV400 frame."

djiphantom,3b0zhq,RealCasually,4,Thu Jun 25 02:26:55 2015 UTC,It only lets you descend at a certain rate which isn't that fast even if you hold the stick all the way down. It doesn't stop the motors if you go all the way down like on a regular RC controller.
djiphantom,3b0zhq,bexter,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:44:04 2015 UTC,"Really? Full stick down doesn't trigger CSC? It has to be both sticks? I ask because if I am on the ground and hold down for around 3 seconds, the motors turn off."
djiphantom,3b0zhq,Encosia,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:52:59 2015 UTC,"No. A CSC is only the gestures that use both sticks. The motors stopping when you hold down only seems to occur if you hold down for a few seconds and its altitude doesn't change during that time.  I almost always descend from high altitudes with full down, but don't expect too much even then. It still descends very slowly compared to how quickly it climbs, to avoid entering vortex ring state."

djiphantom,3b0zhq,yonkfu,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:28:27 2015 UTC,If I'm really high I funnel down. Full tilt forward and full yaw left or right. But putting the left stick all the way down is ok too. Just don't put both sticks all the way down and your good. My friend did that while about 6 feet off the ground and the motors shut off
djiphantom,3b0zhq,macdaddyold,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:36:13 2015 UTC,Full down is the only way.  It's slow for a reason.  Any faster and you'd enter a vortex ring states and crash.  You can only enter cSC if you bring both sticks down & in or down & out.  That can occur in mid air.  Don't do that...
djiphantom,3b0zhq,jlbphotos,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:55:44 2015 UTC,When landing I just hold the left stick for a few seconds to trigger shut-down. As long as altitude doesn't change it cuts power. Handy for catch landings (not that I condone thrm)

djiphantom,3aycdj,jcBoom,2,Wed Jun 24 15:55:44 2015 UTC,"Sort of.   At some point the Phantom 2 was upgraded from the 9443 propeller to the 9450, which is the same size used by the Phantom 3.  However there are two models of 9450 propeller - one has composite (plastic) threading, and the other has metal.   Either will work on the Phantom 2. The composite model is recommended for the Phantom 3   Ostensibly the reason you don't want to use the metal version on the P3 is the risk of it coming loose in flight due to the P3's active engine braking (combined with the lower friction of the metal threads).  Although I'm not going to volunteer to go test it myself, I'd like to point out that I have yet to read an actual account of someone's props coming loose in flight.  Or an official statement from DJI about it.  They simply don't list the P3 as supported on the product page.  Source: These props are compatible with the Phantom 2 or 3.  These are not.  This video goes into (speculative) detail about it."

djiphantom,3aw5yf,cynar,2,Wed Jun 24 05:56:27 2015 UTC,"I had something similar happen once. Not as bad but I landed hard enough to buckle the legs and flex blades into prop guards.  I believe, in hindsight, one of my props sheared off in flight. One had some slight damage on take off, but looked flyable. That blade had a distinctly different break on it, with the tip not found. Never fly with a blade with a potential hairline crack forming.  The video even showed the moment something failed and it destabilized. I have used it to teach people why you never fly over uncontrolled crowds.  None of this will bring your quad back, but it might help you figure out what happened, or stop it happening to someone else."
djiphantom,3aw5yf,thruxton,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:35:39 2015 UTC,"You might actually be right. I only recovered 3 props from the crash scene, i just assumed the 4th flew off when it hit the ground and i just couldn't find it. When I slow down the video it definitely looks like it tilts back to the right before it tumbles. The right rear motor is the one I replaced and it required more than just a simple spin like the other 3 to fasten the props."
djiphantom,3aw5yf,EL_Brento7,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:00:02 2015 UTC,It does look like a prop came off. One thing you might have done better is fly lower and slower. You just changed a major component.

Second time, I parked in the park, on the right side where there are few cars, and flew over the outside of the parking lot. Using 2.7K video, and zooming in post production makes it seem that I am closer to the roller coaster, but actually just hovering above the outer end of the parking lot.. I didn't ask anyone, but a security guy came up to me and didn't disprove. I didn't fly like others into areas with people, or especially into the park!"

The only problem is that all the parks prohibit drones, as I'm sure you know, and it's on a peninsula, which makes it extremely hard to take off from pretty much anywhere that's not their property. I thought about taking off from the beach area, which is more or less not crowded, but I have no doubt I would have been approached by a bunch of butt-hurt security guards.  Long story short, you have to know your surroundings and boundaries if you plan on flying over a Cedar Fair park."

djiphantom,3atbmq,Tom_Pac,15,Tue Jun 23 10:02:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly man, i've just bought my first drone (P3 Advanced). It's honestly not that difficult. If you have any experience gaming and pick up things relatively quickly you will be fine. Just don't be stupid with it. Go on a fine day, with little/no wind and good satellite coverage and go to a big ass open field with no one around and just get it up 10 metres and practice. Just don't be stupid and you will be fine. Just my opinion clearly."
djiphantom,3atbmq,watzimagiga,3,Tue Jun 23 11:48:23 2015 UTC,"Don't let the there-is-only-one-way-how-to-fly-Nazis hear that...  Anyway: I agree with you. You can read the manual / web, pull the Phantom from the box, set it up correctly (with compass calibration and everything), and start flying in a controlled environment no problem. Then, as you gain confidence, switch to Atti, play with that for a while, and finally learn to fly full manual, so that you know how what to do when something goes wrong."
djiphantom,3atbmq,BlueEdition,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:07:38 2015 UTC,"Same here. I read the entire manual twice before I turned it on, started in wide-open areas like softball fields, and even left it in beginner mode for about a week before venturing out of LoS or very high at all.  It's really not that difficult if you ease your way into it.  I would say that the current situation with the latest firmware and VPS, at least on my P3P, would have made it a lot more iffy for me to get started. So, your mileage might vary.  I'm not an expert, but it seems like learning to fly a different kind of drone with a different type of control system would not necessarily be the best practice for the Phantom anyway. Like racing a dune buggy to prepare you for driving a Tesla."

djiphantom,3atbmq,jonjiv,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:10:23 2015 UTC,This was what I learned on before my P1. The Phantom is much easier to fly so if you can fly the Syma then you'll be great on the Phantom.
djiphantom,3atbmq,xenonsupra,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:47:53 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to support /u/rLanx post.  Most of us still fly our ""practice"" quads even long after getting bigger ""bettter"" quads.  We fly those too.  FWIW, different quads are better for different weather and time constraints ... and flying is just plain fun!"
djiphantom,3atbmq,psychometrixo,3,Tue Jun 23 17:04:54 2015 UTC,"Parrot multis are fun and cool but they're hobbyist dead-ends, not in line with your stated goals.  Probably the best idea is to take the advice we all wish we'd followed and pick up a cheap practice quad and fly it like you stole it until you feel like ""ok I got this.  I only wreck when I try crazy things""  Any well-reviewed quad on Amazon that's less than 50.. hopefully closer to 30 or even 20.. won't let you down.  Just don't go off the beaten path with unreviewed or poorly-reviewed quads unless it's with your eyes wide open about the very real probability you'll be disappointed.  What you're trying to gain with this practice is the muscle memory for knowing how to fly the quad in general, and then how to deal with it when it's coming toward you and right is left and left is right..   These skills will become natural, but they're skills that everyone crashes while acquiring.  Everyone.  The pros crashed their first time.  It's part of the hobby.  It makes not-crashing that much sweeter.  If you have the money ready, there's nothing saying you can't go ahead and get the quad.  Just envision what it's going to feel like when you wreck it    Beware relying on the Phantom's GPS too much.  If you don't learn how to fly in manual mode, you have a high chance of ending up like me.. after a couple of hundred flights, my $1300 setup caught a GPS glitch and veered off and I had to down 'er.  If I'd been more ready to swich in to manual, and more comfortable IN manual, I would never have wrecked.  Don't be like me.  It sucks to be like me and have a wrecked machine that gave you so much enjoyment.  Upside: I've learned a lot since the wreck and can fix what I broke, but all things being equal, I wish I had listened to the advice I was repeatedly given.  The advice I'm giving you: to learn to love manual mode.   GPS usually works.  It RARELY fails.  But WHEN it fails.. you're stuck with a smashed camera platform.  Did I mention not to be like me?  Did I mention that it sucks?  Because it sucks!    edit: credit /u/bened1ct for the ""fly it like you stole it"" line"
djiphantom,3atbmq,psychometrixo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:55:16 2015 UTC,"If it's not too painful, would you mind going into detail about the circumstances of your crash? I'm sure it would be instructive."
djiphantom,3atbmq,Tachyons_for_days,4,Tue Jun 23 17:58:10 2015 UTC,"Sure.  Even though it was months ago now and I've gone over it many times, the pain is still pretty raw.  But here's hoping this rambling tale helps someone keep their quad in the air instead of in pieces.  Background: I'd flown the quad daily for months and months, burning through batteries like mad.  I loved it so much.  I'd never had a problem except for one time when I pushed the battery WAY past safety warnings, my fault.  I asked around about the problem just to learn and people told me to learn to fly in manual mode.  I had other quads that I used to fly hard.  I liked this one because it was fun and easy.. but I wanted to listen to advice and I tried a little, but it was hard and annoying and I said ""if this quad has worked this many times, I must not have 'one of the bad ones'""... That 'one of the bad ones' theory made me feel better and I forgot all about manual mode.  Then one day I was on the second flight of my second battery.  I'd just taken a tour around a square mile or so and was in a great mood.  I did all my pre-flight checks getting ready to take off like I'd gotten used to doing.    All seemed great.    I was out at the border of a big field I typically fly in.  It was about 15 feet away, facing me.  I took off, got it to about 10 feet high and then out of nowhere, the damned thing LEANED HARD front and right.  I mean HARD.  Flew over my left shoulder, gaining speed FAST.  I pulled back and left as hard as I could.  Nothing.  Damn thing kept speeding up, along with the FPV equipment, my GoPro, the gimbal.... I had seconds to decide whether to risk people or property (there were residences within 100 yards .. less than 5 seconds of flight at top speed).  I panicked.  Since I never practiced manual mode on this quad, I had no muscle memory for switching into manual mode..    I forgot all about manual mode in the moment, cut the throttle, and it smashed into the ground, breaking all 4 arms.  It left a massive gash in the ground (those props are no joke) and there were pieces scattered about for maybe 10 yards.  Sad, sad day.  A switch on the controller that I never bothered to use would have been the difference between me still having a great quad to fly and me having a smashed quad I ""get to learn"" how to repair.    FWIW, it is fun to learn.  Building quads is fun for me, but I still haven't repaired that one.  I fly my (many) other quads instead.  Still too painful.  But I will: a nicely packaged GPS-powered camera platform is a damn fun thing to have in the armada.  Anywho... don't be like me.  It sucks!"

They told me to practice.  And like I said.. I did practice.  A couple of times.  Then I flew many dozen more times without thinking about manual mode.  Then, when it counted all of the sudden out of nowhere and with no warning .. my lack of practice gave me a lack of results.  BUT!  Enough doom and gloom.  Totally coincidentally, a buddy at work just got a Phantom and when I saw it new in the box all pretty and ready to go, I got inspired to do the repairs.  It's gonna be better than ever!"

djiphantom,3atbmq,iamzcaptainnow,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:15:58 2015 UTC,I recommend the syma x5c. Order from the syma store snd get the wifi camera separately for another $25. This will give you decent FPV with same range as the quad. Do not order the x5sw as it has a wind problem. I also recommend the syma x8c for s larger quad and again. Order the wifi cam separately. Fly safe and have fun
djiphantom,3atbmq,yonkfu,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:20:35 2015 UTC,"People here are recommending the Syma x5c which I get.... But... I really feel like my Hubsan X4 is better for learning. The Syma is easier, but if you can fly an X4 then you'll easily fly a Phantom or Syma.   The Syma is really light, so it kind of floats in the air. The Hubsan I feel reacts more like a Phantom does in the sense that they both have a little weight behind them.   First time around I bought the Hubsan X4 with the little camera on it H107C, but to be honest, I've used the camera once or twice and it looks like shit. You can grab the non-cam version for $40. I've also bought one used on eBay for like $30 and it works great."
djiphantom,3atbmq,T0mmyGun,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:11:55 2015 UTC,"Hope I'm not too late to the party. I bought the Phoenix flight simulator software. Physics are realistic. You can fly for hours and not have to worry about recharging batteries. If it crashes, you hit the reset button. Then go get a Blade QX or something. I did this before I bought a Phantom 3 Pro. It was a large amount of overkill on my part, but when I got the Phantom it was the easiest part of everything I'd already done. No harm in preparation."

Some shots look washed out, while others have a sky that continually changes saturation/color. Use those ND lenses and adjust to manual settings  *edit- just saw your post in /r/Multicopter where you mentioned the phantom didn't have the nd filter. looks like you know already :)"
djiphantom,3aps0e,Cochise_Gil,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:47:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I was shooting the phantom with an ND8 filter. Really needed a ND16 or 32 for that light. That auto exposure ruins so many shots, especially if sped up. I was so excited to finally see the horses I just left it in auto."

djiphantom,3aq0hw,xenonsupra,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:22:09 2015 UTC,"I reached out to my insurance (Wells Fargo) and got this response:  ""In checking with the underwriters again, there is coverage for the drone itself under your property coverage subject to your policy deductible, but would exclude collision/colliding with the ground.  The settlement of a property loss claim would be based on actual cash value at the time of the loss rather than a replacement value.  If your drone is stolen from your vehicle two years from now, there would be coverage subject to your deductible of $500 and based on the value of a 2 year old drone.  Under the liability section, the definition of aircraft in the policy wording is any aircraft designed to carry people/cargo.  The carriers are stating that since the drones carry a camera this would mean they are excluded from liability coverage.  I pushed the fact that the camera could be integrated into the hull of the drone and not technically ‘attached’ but they stated the only thing in the model aircraft should be an engine.  Model aircraft are covered by the policy wording for liability coverage.  Their other concern is that intentional acts are not covered under the liability section of the policy.  If you know you are using a drone with a camera that could be an invasion of a person’s privacy, this is an intentional act.  There might be a  commercial general liability type policy that would cover the use of a drone, but the cost of this type of policy could be over $1,000 a year and it would depend on what you are planning on doing with the drone."""

djiphantom,3am9xq,Chimpville,2,Sun Jun 21 18:51:23 2015 UTC,It does and it even has a specific app to define an area to be imaged and do an auto collect.
djiphantom,3am9xq,chiliedogg,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:40:31 2015 UTC,"It does.  There's an Android App for capturing the imagery then sending it to the mapping software on the PC.  Unfortunately, the version of the PC software that lets you export the generated model costs 350 dollars a month, or a 1-time charge of 8700 dollars.  I get that their client is commercial, but Jesus Tapdancing Christ they're leaving a lot of money on the table by pricing it out of range for the rapidly-growing hobbyist market.  And the commercial crowd is going to be using products by ESRI and Intergraph that have a lot of other features.  I'm in the industry they're aiming at (GIS) and I can guarantee you this isn't going to fly there either.  It's not precise enough to replace LIDAR drone scans that they're starting to do already, so there's very little commercial application at this price either.  This is for a scale between satellite and LIDAR, and I'm just not sure there's a justification for it.  You need either high detail or large area.  Doing half of both gets you neither."
djiphantom,3am9xq,yonkfu,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:14:02 2015 UTC,Ya that price is way to high for me. I would rather get the Ebee that comes with all this software already. And it renders the maps much faster.
djiphantom,3am9xq,chiliedogg,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:42:07 2015 UTC,"There is a free version of the software, but it only lets you view the model and make a flyby video of the model.

There is a little bit of pressure, but nothing that concerns me, I think its a good thing to have it decently snug to stop it from bouncing around and etc. If you dislike the snugness, you could always cut out some foam from the lid's layer of foam and then it wouldn't be tight at all!"

Overall I'm much happier with it than the original lens and I'm sure I would  be even happier on a 3+ Black or Hero 4. As you can see, the process was easy enough.   Getting the 5.4mm lens in focus can be annoying, but really wasn't too hard at all. Lastly, as for removing the lens and replacing it with the original - the original lens (for me) was very difficult to refocus and after swapping the lenses about 10 times I actually broke the original fisheye by being too careless with my tool and separating the different glass pieces of the lens.

Keep in mind that once you install it you are more zoomed in than the tock lens which means you now have more jello in your shots due to the zoom.  All of these lenses fail miserably with sun flares as well.  Where the gopro stock lens handles flare with ease, these lenses just wash out with unusable footage and stills.

djiphantom,3agyxw,keystoneg,3,Sat Jun 20 02:16:53 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone thanks for the comments. So I just answered this question on my Facebook page. I hope it's ok if I'm lazy and I just copy and paste it.   Thanks for the feedback on my drone video. I've had some questions about what happened and why. I was at the start of the bridge flying and I had exhausted my first battery. I was waiting for my motors to cool down before I did my second flight. At that time I was approached by a DCNR ranger and he informed I had to stop. He was very polite and professional about it. I packed up my things and met him in the parking lot because he offered some more information to me. Unfortunately, even he wasn't exactly sure of the laws, seeing as he was just told this not too long ago. He just knew he had to enforce that I couldn't fly there anymore. His supervisor will call me in the next few days to follow up with my questions. From my understanding, it has to do with the FAA and not the DCNR. The DCNR can't provide me permission to fly at the state park even though they regulate it. I have to file a petition with the FAA to be able to fly there, which I'm currently doing. I was disappointed, as I've been planning this video for months. The video I made was from footage just to scout the area and to practice my shots. Though upset, I understand why I had to stop. The DCNR has to think about the visitors and their safety and they, too, have to follow rules. If a drone ever landed on someone it could seriously injure them and they are responsible for the protection and safety of everyone there. My only gripe is that I'm going to have to fill out paper work and wait months before I hear anything about if I've been granted permission or not. It boils down to a broad strokes solution to a handful of people ruining the business/hobby for everyone else (The idiots flying them on the White House lawn). However, I understand the need for regulation, even if it needs refined. After all, if you are going to fly in public and around people you should be experienced and cautious. I do wish the local government and officials had more of a role in granting permission, they are the ones there everyday.

Which, though it is a prime platform to exhibit the beauty of a natural feature - I think it has less to do with liability and much more to do with the impact on soundscape and aesthetics one would expect at a park. If I was having a moment of awe at a view and a drone was flying within audible/visual distance, it would absolutely break the moment and be a cause for distraction. NPS and other agencies are extremely sensitive about this (well before drones were around too)."
djiphantom,3agyxw,jonny360,2,Sat Jun 20 16:04:15 2015 UTC,"That is a really good point. I was feeling a bit inconsiderate yesterday but then most of the reaction from the people was curiosity and were excited. I know that's not always the case.  It would be cool though if you file or ask permission and they could give you a designated time. The park, I mean, I know I have to file with the FAA. The park a has asked me for my other work and to post it in their new visitor center and on their website. It's small area and any publicity would help. I wish it was easier to be able to work with them on doing videos like this. It already has a bunch of views and shares on my Facebook page and the result is more people wanting to come check out the bridge. Which is the point, I'm proud to be where I'm from and am glad I can help improve my area. Thanks for the response!"
djiphantom,3agyxw,jonny360,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:15:58 2015 UTC,File what with the FAA. There is nothing for you to file. The FAA does not specifically regulate the airspace for drones above parks.
djiphantom,3agyxw,jonny360,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:04:58 2015 UTC,"The ranger that stopped me handed me a packet that specifically had Section 333 in it and said if I wanted to fly to look into that. Not arguing with you, just telling you what he told me. Maybe he is uniformed as well, but he made it seem like DCNR didn't have the final say in letting me fly and it was out of their hands. If I wanted to fly to file with the FAA. Again, just repeating what I was told."
djiphantom,3agyxw,jonny360,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:01:26 2015 UTC,"Sec 333 refers to commercial filming. If you weren't being paid to shoot this then sec 333 does not apply to you as a hobbyist. Just like anything else in life this is an example of knowing your rights and the laws around the activity you are doing. As a photographer for many years I have been faced with situations where a security guard/cop/citizen told me I couldn't take a photo of something. I was well informed of my rights as a photographer while in school so I knew I could and they had no right to tell me I couldn't. It always ended with me telling them I had every right to photograph and they had no right to stop me, which they never did.    Petitioning for Exemption under Section 333  The below list contains step-by-step instructions for requesting FAA authorization to operate a UAS for civil (non-governmental) purposes other than for recreation or hobby."
djiphantom,3agyxw,skidamarink,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:25:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was under the impression until yesterday that Section 333 was commercial only and does not apply to hobby use. Then the ranger confused me on it. I will say one major detail to this story that I left out, was it is close to a small airport. Half the time it's inactive and then a company buys it and then it is again. It's currently active with three flights a day, so I was very in the wrong. I didn't take the craft above 400 feet which I know that doesn't matter in the five mile radius. It didn't show up on my DJI Pilot app or warn me, but again, ignorance isn't an excuse. I have read different things on airport radius. I've seen some say three miles, which if that's the case then I'm in the clear, but most say five. On the FAA site is says all I have to do is contact the air control tower and get permission from them before I fly. So, I guess, if I'm not making money, and I get permission from the air control tower, then I should be allowed to do it. Or am I still being really dumb? People in my area have been making videos at this place all spring. They just outlawed it or I should stay finally started stopping people on June 5th. I'm the first one to be stopped as there are few other drone videos of this place on the web. The DCNR is going to contact me this week. They were nice about it and the ranger actually knew me. Hopefully we can figure something out."
djiphantom,3agyxw,jonny360,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:54:04 2015 UTC,The ranger is wrong. Sec 333 only applies to non hobby/recreation use IE commercial. The Ranger has no jurisdiction over airspace so he has no right to stop you for flying near an airport. You are supposed to contact the airport manager or tower if flying within 3 miles. But it is not illegal to fly within 3 miles of an airport. I've actually flown on an airport before with permission. We don't contact the tower at my local airfield because they know there are always people flying there. In general I've found that most towers are surprised when anyone calls and don't care that you fly as long as you stay out of the flight path of incoming and outgoing aircraft. Now your park may have passed a new ordinance that outlaws rc aircraft. Thats totally possible. But in that case just kindly ask which ordinance prohibits you from flying. If they try to say its an FAA rule inform them that they are interpreting the FAA rules incorrectly and they may want to contact the FAA for clarification.
djiphantom,3agyxw,skidamarink,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:58:56 2015 UTC,There are so many different sources and opinions when it comes to these laws. You've been awesome. Thank you so much for your help and advice. It's been really helpful.
djiphantom,3agyxw,jonny360,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:21:38 2015 UTC,No. National parks are no fly zones as designated by the park service. State parks depend on the parks regulations and vary by state and park. It is not illegal to fly over the airspace so if you were to launch outside the boundaries of a park and fly over it there is nothing that could be done.
djiphantom,3agyxw,Jourei,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:04:23 2015 UTC,"Precisely why I said ""most"", there are still a handful of state parks who have yet to introduce regulations. The onus is on the pilot."

But they say the original owner would likely not get in trouble. While the state parks follow the National Park Service’s policies, there are no signs warning people against drone use.

The park ranger knew who I was before we even started talking. Plus, they don't know much about the drone laws. So, I've been talking with the local DCNR and doing everything I can to get their permission and to work with them. That way they might not only let me video there and other spots but actually work with me. Plus, I figure I can be patient and let the process sort itself out, in the long run, it may help me out as well as other flyers and give us a good name. I think half the problem is they see people doing whatever they want and then a knee jerk reaction is to shut everything down. If this all goes to hell, then I will most certainly exercise my rights and fly wherever I'm allowed."

djiphantom,3afdv8,HolyBatTokes,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:55:42 2015 UTC,"thats why i bought a phantom 1 on Meh for $315 and a GoPro 1 for $129.  much cheaper, but not as good."
djiphantom,3afd3a,shep979,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:57:45 2015 UTC,"I don't really see the value in the the Inspire 1, just picked up the professional 3. And it's basically the same package except smaller, less expensive and produces the same quality content. Why would i want to purchase this over the inspire 1?"
djiphantom,3afd3a,newjerseykita,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:13:23 2015 UTC,"I can help! Here are the major differences. The Phantom line is notorious for the propellors getting in your video footage/image capture. You will line up a great shot, then all of a sudden, the damn prop will get in the way. You battle this by positioning your Phantom camera at a lower angle. Problem solved. The inspire 1 has retractible landing gear, therefor eliminating the prop shots from your footage. All in all yes, the camera is the same. But the biggest difference is Propellor Blinds. Yes, this effect is what occurs when you fly your phantom at just the right angle (usually towards the direction of the sun), and it causes a shadow to appear like blinds over your footage. It is the worst! You don't get anything like that on the inspire 1, and while many have claimed that you do, I have challenged these people to post proof of this while the landing gear is up, and none has surfaced. So if you are ok with those types of issues showing up in your footage, then, no don't get an inspire 1. If you do want flawless footage, then by all means spend a little bit more. If you have a client who expects their footage, and you have to sort through what you've captured by editing out props in your shots, propellor blind effect, and so forth, it becomes a bit of a nightmare."
djiphantom,3afd3a,whowantscake,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:56:01 2015 UTC,"Great point, I see that point about the Inspire 1 and i have realized that about it for a long time but when will the inspire 1 be upgraded and what will it take to really be steps ahead of the P3 professional?"
djiphantom,3afd3a,newjerseykita,2,Fri Jun 19 22:20:27 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that it has only really been 6 months since the Inspire 1 has officially been out on the market. This is DJI's flagship model, and if anything gets an upgrade, it will be their modular camera. This is where it will get interesting. So, those night flights can now be worth while with the new infrared/night vision/heat sensing camera(s). This is something that they will most likely release for SARs. Possibly a title shift camera, or replaceable lens. That is something that will be leaps and bounds for creativity, not to mention usefulness over the P3. If you spend 3K on a UAV, it is nice to be able to upgrade the camera without having to replace the entire system. I would say they will release something of a camera upgrade/companion early next year."
djiphantom,3afd3a,whowantscake,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:43:12 2015 UTC,As a professional photographer... this would be the game changer that would make me want to upgrade and commit to a model with upgrade such as that.

djiphantom,3afd3a,newjerseykita,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:48:54 2015 UTC,But then you are still dealing with a quad. Just saw yet another inspire fall out of the sky yesterday (second one i've seen in person). If i'm dumping money into something I don't want a quad. I want an octo. The phantom is perfect because its cheap and portable. When you want something higher end you need to go beyond a medium quad like the inspire.
djiphantom,3afd3a,jonny360,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:35:55 2015 UTC,/u/jonny360 i've never heard of this happening until now. As an amateur drone photographer and videographer elaborate on why this would only be an issue with a quad as opposed to an octocopter?
djiphantom,3afd3a,newjerseykita,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:24:48 2015 UTC,If a quad loses a motor/prop/esc there is no way for it to maintain stability. When one corner goes it just starts flipping and crashes. A hex or octo can usually lose one motor/prop/esc and keep flying. An x8 octo can lose two. So when you want to carry bigger/more expensive gear its good to go with more rotors. Not just because you can lift more but also because you have redundancy in case of failure.
djiphantom,3afd3a,jonny360,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:34:41 2015 UTC,"Great point, but isn't DJI aware of this risk and compensates that for mechanical failure in a warranty or something?"
djiphantom,3afd3a,newjerseykita,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:50:20 2015 UTC,"I haven't had to deal with that with my phantom. I see many issues to trusting DJI to deal with such an event. What if it crashes in water and is not recoverable? What if DJI tries to blame you for improper prop care, not correctly attached props, improper motor care etc. They certainly won't take care of you if youre using a Naza and its a custom build, nor would they replace your camera gear whatever that may be. Further what if someone or something is injured or damage in said crash. Highly unlikely that DJI would take any responsibility. So it seems much safer to me to use a bigger copter when the prices and risk get higher."
djiphantom,3afd3a,jonny360,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:53:33 2015 UTC,"There is something you first would need to understand when it comes to piloting a UAV. If you are doing it for profit vs doing it for hobby. DJI is a company that sells a popular drone line, and they practically fly off the shelves (no pun intended). They are aware of the risks involved with these aircraft, but the responsibility is in your hands once you've made that purchase. Back to profit vs hobby, it is important that you purchase liability insurance for your flying camera. There is also a type of RC insurance that covers you as a hobbyist, but the liability one covers for profit and hobby. DJI has a well written manual that states warranty coverage of the motors with recommendation on prop life, batteries, etc. If you fly over water, it is your risk. Bigger copters are bigger risks despite the redundancy. What pilots need to follow are flight operating procedures. What these are, are based on you, your craft, the line of work you're doing, various factors that involve critical thinking. In my experience DJI does take care of its customers should there be motor failure during a warranty period. However they wont be held accountable if your drone should hit/kill someone, damage property, etc. This is why you should carry liability."
djiphantom,3afd3a,whowantscake,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:15:10 2015 UTC,Yes you will get some props in your shot. But a simple tilt down of the camera will generally solve that while getting basically the same shot. But you are right the inspire is better about that.   As for the prop blinds of course the inspire can get it to. Its all dependent on the angle of the sun to cast a shadow over the camera. Having a hood shade on the phantom should help greatly with this.
djiphantom,3afd3a,jonny360,0,Fri Jun 19 23:33:59 2015 UTC,"I dont disagree that this can happen on the inspire 1, however I have not seen any proof of this. It doesn't mean that it doesn't exist, but I've yet to get the prop blinds on mine, and I have tried. Can you produce the footage for this?"
djiphantom,3afd3a,whowantscake,2,Fri Jun 19 23:42:05 2015 UTC,Its physics. I dont have an inspire one so no I can't. But it will happen for sure in the correct circumstances.

djiphantom,3afd3a,whowantscake,-4,Fri Jun 19 23:46:38 2015 UTC,"haha youre a joke. You agree that it can happen, so what else is there to discuss?"
djiphantom,3afd3a,jonny360,-1,Sat Jun 20 00:08:11 2015 UTC,"On the contrary. My good man, how can you make the claim that it can have prop blinds when you don't even own one? Physics you say? Ooook, maybe (is that the same as agreeing? idts). DJI made the landing gear retractible for this very reason. I've not seen any prop blinds even on the shittiest of footage. So what I guess we can discuss is how you come to this conclusion by just using the word physics. Please explain. Use crayons if you need to, because I am having a hard time understanding."
djiphantom,3afd3a,whowantscake,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:01:24 2015 UTC,Since youre too dense to understand what causes prop blinds maybe this diagram will help. The inspire has the camera lower which will help reduce getting the props in the line of the sunlight and casting a shadow. But at the right angle you'll still get a shadow and see blinds. I don't need to see it to know it will happen. It happens on every one of the rigs ive built when the suns at the right angle.

djiphantom,3adl9j,passthatDutcher,2,Fri Jun 19 06:38:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is brutal, it is more just the length of time it takes them to process the 333 exemption. I haven't kept up much with it but I know they have a backlog of hundreds of them with only a small handful of people working on them, having to go through each individually in a drawn out process. Filing for it seems simple and straightforward enough, but like Piratedan said, you would probably be better off just waiting. Things will be a whole lot quicker and easier at that point and that might even pass before you would get through the process anyway."
djiphantom,3adl9j,steve1two,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:57:40 2015 UTC,I think it is pretty brutal personally. Getting a pilots license is hardwork and expensive. To file for sec 333 you need to write an entire manual for your machine. I've seen a place charging $6000 just to write the manual and file for you.
djiphantom,3adl9j,jonny360,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:37:33 2015 UTC,I just assumed someone asking would have known that much/already had one. In defense of that though if you can find somebody who has an aircraft that just wants it in the air you might be able to save quite a bit on rental fees. You don't have to have private for it anymore unless something change since I last looked.  I read through a handful (maybe 5) of the requests and I didn't think they looked that scary. One company's language was worse than what I am typing here and they got approved.
djiphantom,3adl9j,steve1two,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:52:35 2015 UTC,You do need a private pilots license. Don't know where you've seen otherwise.
djiphantom,3adl9j,jonny360,2,Sat Jun 20 00:10:11 2015 UTC,"The agency now allows operations under these exemptions by people who hold a recreational or sport pilot certificate. Previously, Section 333 operators were required to have at least a private pilot certificate.

djiphantom,3adl9j,steve1two,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:31:17 2015 UTC,It still doesn't seem worth it to me at this point. For someone who doesn't have a license by the time you get a license and then file and are granted a sec 333 the new rules will be in place or nearly in place. So you've spent a lot of time and money for what? Maybe a few months of legal commercial flying? There are so many people doing it illegally seems to me that unfortunately the FAA created a situation where its better to do it illegally and keep your head down while you wait for the regulations to get in place.
djiphantom,3adl9j,jonny360,2,Sat Jun 20 00:37:09 2015 UTC,"I have submitted my section 333 exemption and I am waiting to here back.  It is currently posted where individuals can see and comment on it.  From a recent hearing, it sounds like the FAA Ruling is about a year away.  The exemption should take 2 months.  So if you want an extra 10 month head start on your competitors, I would recommend submitting your exemption as soon as possible.  That is 10 months to establish a customer base, network, advertise, and get a leg up."

djiphantom,3aae77,DrStemSell,2,Thu Jun 18 19:29:12 2015 UTC,Because I trust myself more than the RTH failsafe. My method should generally allow me to get that feed back very quickly. If that still doesn't work after a few seconds I would probably hit RTH.
djiphantom,3aae77,jonny360,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:56:37 2015 UTC,Return to home works very well as long as you get good sat lock and set the home point before taking off. If you try using it more you'll trust it more. I still fly home whenever I can.
djiphantom,3aae77,DrStemSell,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:00:50 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it works well, I'm just saying that if I know where my craft is in relation to myself I would rather just fly it myself than depend on a system which as multiple points of failure, however unlikely."
djiphantom,3aae77,jonny360,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:35:53 2015 UTC,I don't know what multiple points of failure you think it has. But I personally use RTH to get it back close enough to regain video or so I can at least see it. So far its always worked great. Another poster below thinks there are some kinda obstacles that it will hit. Well you just flew out that far. So you should know if there was anything to hit. You should also know how high your RTH is set to. And it should be set high enough to not hit anything. Thats how I fly and its always worked for me anyways.
djiphantom,3aae77,DrStemSell,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:52:24 2015 UTC,"I was talking about the fact that the home point may not get recorded correctly, or you may have some kind of compass error that you are unaware of, or it does hit an obstacle on the way back. I fly a lot in the mountains, so there may be obstacles a couple hundred meters above my home point. I do realize I can set the home point to be higher, but again I just trust myself more than that system. To each their own there I'm sure RTH works great 99.9% of the time."
djiphantom,3aae77,jonny360,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:55:26 2015 UTC,Home point is displayed on your map. So you can see if its somehow off. Compass errors are also displayed on your app. I'm not sayin you should fly differently. Fly how you want. But the home point does work well and there is no reason not to use it if one wishes.
djiphantom,3aae77,DrStemSell,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:57:18 2015 UTC,Agreed but home point isn't displayed on the map when you are in the middle of nowhere without a data plan and without a cached map.
djiphantom,3aae77,jonny360,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:15:58 2015 UTC,Sure it is. Home point is still shown as well as the pilot location. There isn't a map there. But there is a home point next to where youre standing :)

djiphantom,3aae77,jonny360,0,Thu Jun 18 22:00:44 2015 UTC,... Obviously it doesn't have obstacle avoidance. The pilot should put an ounce of thought into where they are flying and how. Point 1 would be to be aware of Los and radio signals. They don't penetrate mountains well. So don't fly behind one.

djiphantom,3aae77,jonny360,0,Thu Jun 18 22:09:55 2015 UTC,No you didn't. Op asked about flying great distances. There's no reason not to use rth.  Because one guy flew onto the other side of a mtn and rth flew him into the mtn is not a reason. Flying long distance doesn't involve flying behind mountains.
djiphantom,3aae77,stroginof,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:46:27 2015 UTC,"Sure I did. Mountains, trees, power lines, buildings... its all CFIT, and its the main reason to not just complacently hit ""return to home"" and assume everything will be OK"

There began to be significant latency in the control signals, meaning that a turn command was not received in a timely way and it therefore became hard to control. I activated the Home function, and it promptly began to return towards me. I took back manual control and explored the edges of reception.

Once it's close enough to come back in range, you can stop the failsafe process and regain control. Worst case scenario, you could turn off your controller for a second to start failsafe automatically. I have the Phantom 2, but I'm sure this applies to the 3 as well."
djiphantom,3aae77,keithkman,0,Thu Jun 18 16:12:05 2015 UTC,"What I was wondering is that if I lose video signal, and the remote control is still in range of the drone, would the dji phantom pilot app still work so I could see it on GPS?

djiphantom,3aae77,keithkman,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:38:42 2015 UTC,A good question. I lose video signal regularly but I haven't checked to see if I can still see it on gps.

If the above is true, is it possible to record HD output directly to tablet or other device while the drone is flying?   Kind of.  It's possible to download the video directly to the device, but not to record it ""live.""  Unless you had a third party screencap utility and were just recording the Pilot app.   and what resolution would I get if I was able to do this. I.e. would I be able to record a full 30fps 4k via Lightbridge.   Downloads are limited to something that's slipping my mind at the moment, but I think it's 1080p 30fps.  If you want live, latency-free, broadcast-quality HD streaming you'll need a bigger drone and one of these.   Is the video feed transmitted encrypted? or is it transmitted for anyone to receive?   The transmitter and receiver are ""linked"" like a console and controller, and use packetized data.  So it's fairly secure."

djiphantom,3a8taw,Jourei,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:30:51 2015 UTC,"The fast forward is quite obvious, but I suppose I have to ask; what does the H.S stand for, and what does it measure?"
djiphantom,3a8taw,theprez98,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:19:42 2015 UTC,Horizontal Speed (or Vertical Speed for VS) in meters per second. 15 M/S=33 MPH. The spec sheet for the P3 lists 16 m/s as the top speed so this seems about right.

djiphantom,3a8krd,_TNB_,2,Thu Jun 18 02:49:57 2015 UTC,What others said. For decent video you want a gimbal. For OK video you can do an anti jiggle to start. I have a p1 and have to run post stabilizing with just anti jiggle.

djiphantom,3a5ez2,DwarvenRedshirt,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:33:51 2015 UTC,Isn't this a commercial use of a drone? Doesn't mention anything about the lifeguards holding a private pilots license or sec 333 waiver.
djiphantom,3a5ez2,jonny360,2,Wed Jun 17 21:40:22 2015 UTC,The lifeguard service here is provided by the city. Definitely wouldn't fall under commercial use.
djiphantom,3a5ez2,kegtech,2,Wed Jun 17 21:47:20 2015 UTC,In what way would being provided by the city not fall under commercial? If police departments can't use them i'm surprised lifeguards can.
djiphantom,3a5ez2,jonny360,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:54:02 2015 UTC,"Even with the extremely broad definition of commercial use given by the FAA, which is operating a drone with the intent of direct or indirect financial gain, it would be hard to categorize a lifeguard using a drone in the course of his duties for an organization who receives all of its funding from taxpayer money as commercial.  The issues with police and drones is a whole separate issue which stems from privacy concerns and overreach.  Better examples of government organizations using drones would be the USGS and NOAA which used drones long before the revised FAA rules and continue to operate them uninhibited afterwards."
djiphantom,3a5ez2,kegtech,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:12:54 2015 UTC,Fair enough. Any links to USGS or NOAA using drones in the NAS? Isn't the FAA's argument that safety is the issue with banning commercial flights currently? I wasn't aware of any agency using drones in the US NAS with the current FAA UAS grey area.

Also I almost always shoot my video in 1080 60f/s for personal stuff which might make the biggest difference.

You should break these shots up with a different angle then go back to your birds eye shot. Overall looks good though, keep it up!"

I have yet to have a problem, so no advice on the customer service there. However, based on the extremely fast processing and shipping; im sure they would be great to work with.  PS. Go with the professional. Not only for the 4k video (which even shot in 1080p is better than the Advance's camera) but get it just for the faster charge time as well!"

djiphantom,3a066x,jonny360,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:00:37 2015 UTC,thingiverse link   I printed one of these and did not have good results. I think it added to much weight to the front of the camera and it was no longer balanced. The gimbal motors are absolutely tiny so I think if you want to add a hood you need to try and add some weight to the back of the camera to balance it out. I got vertical jitter in my footage when I had the hood on.

djiphantom,39z6sz,steve1two,2,Mon Jun 15 23:48:49 2015 UTC,"The apps are fairly similar between the iPad Mini and a similar Android tablet. The main differences that I've seen, comparing an iPad Mini 2 to a Nexus 7 are:   The iPad's screen is dramatically brighter and more clearly visible when you're outdoors on sunny days. The iOS app is noticeably faster and smoother. Mainly when poking around through the menus, but it is an easily noticeable difference.   Having my choice between the iPad Mini 2, an iPhone 6, a Galaxy S5, and the Nexus 7, I am not hesitant at all to choose the iPad Mini 2. You definitely want a lanyard of some kind to offset the weight of either tablet though."
djiphantom,39z6sz,Encosia,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:42:17 2015 UTC,"What if you were asked about a Galaxy S 8.4 compared to an iPad Mini? Basically I really wanted to get an Android because I always have iPhones (I have an iPhone 6 but want a bigger screen to use) and I always use Android tablets (I have a Nexus 7, just the 2012 version). An Android tablet I would use around the house, an iPad is going to just be dedicated to the P3 use, which I guess isn't so bad, I just thought I'd capitalize on getting a new tablet to use for both - still want the best performance possible though."
djiphantom,39z6sz,Encosia,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:48:23 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried that particular Samsung. Across my handful of devices, the Android devices are all consistently less bright and clear in bright outdoor conditions."
djiphantom,39z6sz,cbdudek,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:07:40 2015 UTC,I have a Nexus 7 2013 edition and the pilot app works fine on it.  I use the pilot app off the google play store.  Please note that I tried this on a older version of the Nexus 7 (the first generation that came out in 2012) and I had some issues with stability.
djiphantom,39z6sz,keithkman,2,Tue Jun 16 13:30:51 2015 UTC,Are you aware that Pilot version on the play store is two versions old?
djiphantom,39z6sz,cbdudek,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:13:38 2015 UTC,"Yes I am.  The issue I had was stability with the one on the website.  I had crashes and issues that I couldn't explain.  Yet, when I installed the one on the play store, it worked fine.    IMHO, when I am flying a $1300 piece of equipment, I will go with the software package that is the most stable.  I don't care about the latest version."
djiphantom,39z6sz,Encosia,2,Tue Jun 16 17:33:30 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I've been using the latest version from the DJI site on my Galaxy S5 and haven't had any stability issues.  Having current-version options like NTSC/PAL (especially since the initial setup took my NTSC choice and set me to PAL) and manual home point setting has been nice. Recommended."

djiphantom,39z6sz,tman67234,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:21:13 2015 UTC,Well that sucks. I was having some issues with my iPad Mini 2. It would always have a 1-sec lag but would get progressively worse throughout the flight. One person mentioned the heat (it has been hot) was overheating the iPad making it lag. It makes sense in my case at least. I also turned on Hardware Decode and it removed the 1-sec lag completely but I have not had a chance to fly it yet to see if it helps for the duration. I guess I wont downgrade to a a Nexus 7 after hearing your experience. Just wish I could get a tablet to use on it that I actually want to use outside of that too.

If you were looking straight down at a flat surface from 400ft, that would give you a view of 858ft (assuming I remember geometry class from 20+ years ago correctly).  Since the photos are 16:9 ratio, that means you're probably looking at an 858ft x 482.6ft photo area."

djiphantom,39v738,directedbyg,8,Mon Jun 15 01:54:11 2015 UTC,Buy a Hubsan x4 asap for $40 and fly the crap and crash the crap out of it.  Then fly your 1000$ drone
djiphantom,39v738,Ludachris9000,2,Mon Jun 15 02:13:06 2015 UTC,"I read this advice in couple places before my P3A arrived a couple weeks ago, but I didn't follow it. I just eased my way into getting more comfortable with controlling the P3A. It's very easy to control; I'm not sure I understand what flying a Hubsan would have done that I couldn't do by taking it one step at a time with my P3A. I'm not saying one approach is better than the other, but you'll be fine either way."
djiphantom,39v738,genpub,2,Mon Jun 15 12:33:59 2015 UTC,"They say this because the phantom uses GPS to fly, this is why it is so easy. Should you ever lose lock on the satellites it becomes much harder to fly and if you have no experience it's probably bye bye money. It's always good to have a little too much experience even if you never run into the situation."
djiphantom,39v738,Wiilyt,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:53:44 2015 UTC,If you lose GPS lock it becomes slightly harder to fly.  Unfortunately most places you would lose the GPS signal are exactly the kind of places you'd want it -- flying around obstacles and such.
djiphantom,39v738,Tachyons_for_days,2,Mon Jun 15 17:24:22 2015 UTC,"As one example, I crashed my hubsan after descending too rapidly, causing it to become unstable as it entered its own prop wash.  I've seen YouTube videos of this happening with phantoms as well.  For a beginner there is nothing obvious about the hazards of descending straight down.  I thought I was being careful even though I wasn't.  Better to learn this lesson with a hubsan than a phantom."
djiphantom,39v738,tinkletwit,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:58:55 2015 UTC,"The Phantom isn't just easy to fly because it uses GPS positioning.  It's easy to fly because it has a whole raft of fly-by-wire and stabilization tools.  It would take multiple simultaneous system failures to make it fly like an X4.  And if you're out of visual range, no amount of flying skill in the world is going to help.  That said, the operator should be comfortable flying it visually without telemetry or FPV, should that link go down, as it's probably the most vulnerable of all the flight assistance systems.  It also makes it possible to get shots that require tricky flying.  I think a lot of people give this advice because they started the hobby by flying quadcopters.  I did too, but I see the Phantom as an entirely different class of aircraft, that requires its own unique set of skills to properly employ."
djiphantom,39v738,Tachyons_for_days,4,Mon Jun 15 17:20:09 2015 UTC,"Hey I started on the phantom 1.1 when it was brand new (probably a mistake looking back) and I had a couple of near misses but here is what I did when I started out and some things I learned from mistakes.   Watch every YouTube tutorial you can. There is now a wealth of tutorials out and you should watch as many as you can before you get out there Bring the manual and quick reference with you and have it near you so you know what the signals mean and can quickly troubleshoot any problem. Calibrate your compass and make sure you have GPS lock before you take off. This works best in a wide open area far away from any metal, power lines, or interference. If you can't get GPS lock, don't take off. This is the biggest reason for flyaways. Know how to take back control of the phantom when it is flying a preconfigured route or executing the return to home function. Test your return to home function. It should fly a few feet straight up in the air and fly straight back to where you took off. If it starts taking off in a wrong direction, immediately take control, land and troubleshoot. Start in big open areas with no trees or power lines for it to get stuck in. Get a firm grasp of recognizing which way it is pointing and bringing it back to you before flying too far off. Start slow and don't jerk the controls or fly too high. If you get to close to something and you are not sure which direction takes you away from it, fly straight up and get clear of it first. The phantom is deceptively easy to control and things can go sideways real quick. Plug it in and update. I recommend giving new updates a week and keep an eye on the forums to make sure it doesn't break something. When first flying start a stopwatch and take note of how long it takes the battery to get low. Keep an eye on the time when flying, it is better to retain positive control and bring it back yourself than have it force land or return to home.   Honestly your best bet is buying a cheap quad like the other guy recommended and wrecking that instead. I didn't do this but looking back I'm very lucky that I didn't outright destroy my first phantom."
djiphantom,39v738,kegtech,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:15:56 2015 UTC,These tips are awesome. I'm in no rush to fly and certainly don't want to crash it or have a fly away situation so I'll watch lots of tutorials before I take off and will only use it in wide open spaces until I'm comfortable. Do you have any indoor flight tips?
djiphantom,39v738,keithkman,3,Mon Jun 15 03:22:13 2015 UTC,"Read, read, read the manual. Hop onto phantompilots.com and do more reading.   Make sure you do a firmware update on the P3 and controller. Do a IMU calibration and gimbal calibration before your first flight.   If you are going to use an apple device, fly the flight simulator until you feel comfortable with the controls. Don't be afraid to ask questions.   And above all else, have fun."

djiphantom,39v738,EL_Brento7,2,Mon Jun 15 03:06:58 2015 UTC,"The CASA defines the commercial use of a drone as anything you’re doing relating to business operations. For example, if you’re a production company strapping a camera to a drone for the purposes of gathering footage, or if you’re flying something into the air to test it via a drone, that’s commercial use.  Before you can even get a drone remote in your hands for commercial purposes, CASA requires that pilots undergo a certification process in order to get an Operator’s Certificate. That demonstrates that you can not only fly a drone safely, but also that you’re aware of rules and regulations relating to drone flights in Australia. In Canada aviation ground school is enough to qualify. It's likely the same there.   The regulations don’t stop there, either: for any drone flights, commercial operators need explicit approval from CASA before you can even leave the ground with your flying machine.  That approval involves filing several important documents with the regulator, including a flight plan and copies of your certifications. After the first application you essentially have a template for future applications. After a proven track record of compliance and safety they can issue a standing permit for up to a year. In Canada liability insurance is also a must. Minimum of $100k.  If a commercial entity is caught operating a drone without any of these things, the flight feds will can come down on you. Hard.  For starters, they can revoke a a commercial entity’s Operator’s Certificate, which is kind of like having your driver’s licence suspended as a taxi driver. It’s all bad. Drone operators can re-apply for their Operator’s Certificate, but that request goes through the CASA which has the power to refuse or place conditions on any new permit."
djiphantom,39v738,KittenSwagger,2,Mon Jun 15 04:10:19 2015 UTC,Yikes! Thanks for all of that. I will look into certification through CASA. I hope the process isn't too painful.

You have to use ND filters to drop the shutter speed to closer to what's acceptable for cinematic video. There are plenty of inexpensive solutions out there for the P3 already, including some that insert into the camera itself after unscrewing the front element.   The Inspire is the same way, but it comes with an ND filter in the box. Don't let this fact change your opinion about the camera, it produces insanely great imagery in the air for a fraction of the cost of even a half decent real camera. We use it on huge productions out here in LA and clients love it."

djiphantom,39t75p,NoRemorse920,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:40:03 2015 UTC,"Aperture changes DoF and exposure. Other things can change exposure, but ONLY aperture can change DoF. That's what I'm getting at. So my overall point is that you don't need aperture control for exposure control, it's only strictly needed for DoF which is pointless in a drone.  As for as EV in manual; I'm not entirely sure. My phantom is on my desk at work to check."
djiphantom,39rs1g,macdaddyold,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:08:20 2015 UTC,"Cool vid. A little editing tip: when you dissolve from one clip to the next, cut both clips down about half a second where the dissolve will be. For example, your first shot has a sudden  jerk while it's dissolving into the second shot. If you cut it down more, or shorten the dissolve length, you won't have those parts you meant to cut out, and for phantom footage the motion will be smoother."

I'd suggest trying it to familiarize yourself with a professional editor interface if it's a hobby you'd like to seriously pursue.   GoPro Studio is a fairly good editor for being free. Also has some pretty good slow motion functionality and effects.   On Mac computers iMovie is actually a pretty decent editor for being free. Not bad to get your feet wet."
djiphantom,39sefj,Stalkker,3,Sun Jun 14 08:21:21 2015 UTC,I'm guessing vortex ring state. Basically if you descend too fast through your own prop wash the blades can stall. Instinct tells you to jam the left stick full but this makes it worse. You need to get out of the turbulent air by pushing the right stick in any direction.

I did everything possible before contacting DJI and they shrugged it off like, ""Oh, it must be DOA, send it back well send you a new one.""   Even though it is rare (so they claim), broken units do get sent out. Dont know if it was messed up in transit to my house or what, but it would not work no matter what I did. DJI customer service is the worst I have dealt with and has turned me off to DJI so quickly. Next time I purchase I am going to a licensed distributor and repair-er, DJI just dosnt give a shit about their customers once they have your money. I paid 1359 dollars on May 19th, and still nothing to show for it. It makes me so mad when I think about it.  Oh and also, they denied my paypal refund, and told me to email them. When I did, not response. Ok, i have to top talking about it  now its making me too mad...."
djiphantom,39ngrc,crazybatteur44,2,Sat Jun 13 00:21:48 2015 UTC,"Calibrate and let it set home on land just before you got out. That way if rth kicks in, it heads to the shore. You should also practice a release where someone holds the phantom over their head by the landing gear. Also practice catching it that way. Get good at cutting the motors fast for the catch"
djiphantom,39ngrc,yonkfu,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:19:53 2015 UTC,"GPS lock would work fine for flight, but RTH is going to send the drone to the water (where you were). If it's a fiberglass boat, I wouldn't expect many issues for the compass, but your milage may vary.  To be honest, I'd be way to scared to launch from a boat. I'm not against flying over water, just having g the RTH position over water. If you lose signal, the thing is going to land itself in the water."
djiphantom,39ngrc,NoRemorse920,2,Sat Jun 13 01:23:41 2015 UTC,"Indeed, no way rth would be useful.  It's a wooden boat, with few electronics so I think it's ok.

Anyway, if I fly it will be 2mn top with a full battery, no more than 150 feet away from the boat...not enough to be confident but still ok to lower the risks.

Beware, once it cancels RTH mine just hovers as though it's confused and does not seem responsive to the controls. I've managed to get it back every time however.   Both times this happened to me I was flying it as the boat and of course the transmitter were moving a fair distance on the water. My P2 thought it had reached maximum distance, but it less than 50 ft from my boat both times it happened.   All I can say is good luck!  Note:  I'm still sleepy and haven't had my coffee yet.

People are asking a lot of stupid things that are specified in the manual.   If you follow these resources, you will see what sort of problems come up time and time again.  People trying to go around buildings, loosing signal, and RTH smacking straight into the building is a common one.  Radio signals are not magic.  If you put something between you and the quad, you are risking losing signal.   Most things are just common sense.  Have enough space.  Be prepared to interact with people if someone approaches you.     Most people get in trouble when they want to take something cool and get close to it.  They might hit it, or get stuck on top a tree.  ""Proximity"" is what gets you."

djiphantom,39kp4m,Yarrvee,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:27:26 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I bought my Phantom 1 (FC40) last summer, and have kitted it out with a gimbal, GoPro H4B, Tall/Wide landing gear, dual battery platforms and a Y adaptor, 9.5"" P2 props, etc., and while I've had a ton of fun learning, I've got so little flight time left (5-8 minutes, even on dual batteries) that I'm looking to REALLY upgrade...not just to a P2 or P3, but to a 450 quad or a 550 hex...  If you think you're ""outgrowing"" the P1, you might want to step right out of the Phantom line altogether - cannibalize what you've got, and build something new that will fly using the NAZA you've got...It's probably going to be quite a bit cheaper in the long run."
djiphantom,39kp4m,Piratedan200,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:39:56 2015 UTC,"I feel that the phantom line is known better as photography/videography platform; whereas the 450 quad and the 550 hex are more known for the hobbyists who want to do high speed aerial stuff.   Out of curiosity, have you tried with only 2 batteries (sounds like you are using 3 right now)? Always wondered what the flight time to battery ratio is, and if it ever becomes a loss."
djiphantom,39kp4m,Yarrvee,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:52:19 2015 UTC,"What you could do is go to something like the Flamewheel 450 kit with a Naza-M controller and put a gimbal on that if you want to focus on photography/videography.  That would give you a similar platform to the phantom in terms of ease of use while having the upgradability of a custom build.

I love flying the P1 with nothing really on it, maybe a gopro because its quick and snaps when turning, but if you're looking to film some good quality stuff, get yourself a p2. There is a deal on amazon right now for $619 that is the P2 and it comes with the zenmuse h3-3d. Obviously you'll want more batteries so those cost extra and you can upgrade to having an fpv system later. Its up to you.  here are some small clips of what ive done with the p2 with zenmuse+gopro  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VUsRi3EM7Y  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YVgF-xje_E"

djiphantom,39lbiq,tman67234,4,Fri Jun 12 15:09:22 2015 UTC,I have one of these MCM black tactical cases. Much cheaper than a pelican case.

djiphantom,39lbiq,xenonsupra,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:56:05 2015 UTC,"That's ridiculously cheap.  How would you say the quality compares to a Pelican case?   I mean for that price I almost don't care, but I'm curious."
djiphantom,39lbiq,Tachyons_for_days,3,Fri Jun 12 17:24:06 2015 UTC,"They're not as ""beautiful"" from the outside, but they're totally solid and waterproof.   I'd probably feel safe parking a car on mine.  It makes a huge difference being able to just throw my Phantom in my car and take it everywhere (previously I was packing it around in loose crates and boxes and always afraid it was going to get thrashed).  I don't know if it's standard for these type of cases but the foam in the MCM is 3 layers and only the top is pick-and-pluck, the lower layers need to be cut.  It's not necessarily a downside, it can be useful for layering your compartments, but it's something to be aware of.  When you get your layout set, you may want to glue them together with contact adhesive."
djiphantom,39lbiq,zerodb,2,Fri Jun 12 17:37:25 2015 UTC,"I've never owned a pelican case but I've seen them. I cannot think of any noticeable differences. I am not sure I'd feel comfortable throwing it in the ocean (I wouldn't do it with a genuine pelican either) but I certainly wouldn't be worried about a little rain.  The only thing of note is that the foam that comes with it is 2 solid pieces and 1 pluckable piece. I thought it was a mistake so I contacted the company and they sent me a replacement foam kit for free. Turns out that one had 2 solids and 1 pluckable too. So I ended up with 2 pluckables that I used. It would've been hard to do with only 1. Even if you order an extra foam kit or two with the case its still significantly cheaper than a Pelican.  My size is a nice tight fit on the phantom 1. Not sure if the Phantom 3 is bigger or not. Basically with my phantom in an empty case it closes no problem, but when all the foam is in it has a little resistance. I determined it was not actually bending the phantom but just compressing the foam very tight around it."

djiphantom,39i2ob,AntiMacro,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:36:53 2015 UTC,Haha. I will feel that way as well for sure. I can't wait to fly it and use the call to home feature :P My P1 almost flew away on me one time. Glad to hear this feedback.
djiphantom,39i2ob,kjartanbj,2,Fri Jun 12 02:20:42 2015 UTC,"Read the manual.  Read it again.  Actually read it this time.  Also read the Tips for Newbies  Ok seriously, read the manual this time.  Thinking of flying near airports, over top of people, over private property, near emergencies? DON'T DO THAT STUFF  Don't record audio. Nobody wants to hear DJI's take on 'flight of the bumblebees' over top of your video."
djiphantom,39i2ob,AntiMacro,2,Fri Jun 12 05:07:05 2015 UTC,P3 doesn't record audio :)

djiphantom,39il5z,tallguy14,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:36:33 2015 UTC,"Have you tried an IMU calibration? Couldn't hurt. Looks like you've done a few poor mans repairs there in lieu of missing parts. I think that replacement bracket for the hero 4 is literally $10 and would be better balanced. They are extremely sensitive and are not meant to vary in weights like larger gimbals (Movi, Ronin, etc...). Assuming though that this has been part of your 6 months of flying, it may have exacerbated some motor damage. Really though it just seems like you need an IMU calibration..."

djiphantom,39il5z,NoRemorse920,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:48:15 2015 UTC,I had a similar thing happen in my brand new P3. It was a loose screw that attached the hardware to the servo shaft. It caused the PID control to react in an overreacting loop.
djiphantom,39hk0f,davidverner,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:31:45 2015 UTC,"It can probably support the weight, but I think you would have some major issues with balance.  Even putting a hero4 on it can throw off the balance.  So your videos from both cameras would likely be lousy."
djiphantom,39hk0f,Piratedan200,2,Thu Jun 11 19:38:18 2015 UTC,I've been using a hero 4 on it with no problems for a while now.
djiphantom,39hk0f,Piratedan200,2,Thu Jun 11 19:41:20 2015 UTC,Oh ok.  I've heard that some people had to glue on a coin to balance it out when using the hero 4.
djiphantom,39hk0f,Zapf,2,Thu Jun 11 19:46:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, you should be doing that, even if it appears to be supporting the imbalance when powered on. Putting additional stress on a motor is silly."
djiphantom,39hk0f,Zapf,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:56:14 2015 UTC,What's the coin weight I should use for the hero 4?  Also where would I attach it?
djiphantom,39hjha,BigFudgeMMA,2,Thu Jun 11 19:28:18 2015 UTC,I would recommend fixing your horizon- it seems tilted to the left
djiphantom,39hjha,walrusrage1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:09:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I did calibrate the IMU. Perhaps my dining room table isn't as level as it should be. Sorry, not sure if I'm typing that correct, but you get my meaning. :)"
djiphantom,39hjha,walrusrage1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:09:00 2015 UTC,"haha now I'm thoroughly confused. I'm using a P2V+, and for panoramas to be taken, I need to stitch multiple photos together in photoshop. Does the P3 have a setting to create them automatically? Also, you should still be able to correct the horizon in post (assuming you're using some sort of photo editing software)"
djiphantom,39hjha,walrusrage1,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:35:16 2015 UTC,"Not as far as I know. I take multiple shots, and use Microsoft Image Composite Editor (real easy, and free) to stitch the images. I edit the images themselves in Adobe Photoshop."
djiphantom,39hjha,KittenSwagger,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:00:24 2015 UTC,"Then you definitely should be able to correct the horizon through a simple crop (rotate slightly down on the right side). Just do it for the entire panorama instead of the individual photos. Also, if you're interested, Russel Brown from Adobe has a great tutorial for creating panoramas from the Phantom here: http://tv.adobe.com/watch/take-flight-into-the-adobe-creative-cloud/creating-aerial-panoramas-from-gopro-hero-3-images/"
djiphantom,39hjha,Tachyons_for_days,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:20:28 2015 UTC,"Great picture. Care to explain your process for taking this? I have a Phantom 3 Professional and just looking to gain experience on how others are framing, and exposing for their shots.   Did you simply just use the exposure wheel until it looked right on your display? What picture mode did you use? How many pictures is this/stitched together?"
djiphantom,39hjha,Tachyons_for_days,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:52:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much mate. I am in every meaing of the word a beginner. In this picture I used the auto settings. But I have started reading up on the different camera settings to try to understand the process better. Anyway, I launch the drone, take a handful, between 8-15 photos. I take the first photo, and pan really, really carefully to the left or right, snap a new picture, rinse repeat. To stitch the photos, I use Microsoft Image Composite Editor, a great and free tool. Add all my photos, and the rest is magic from the software. Good luck friend, hope some of this helps you :-) Here's one I took today - it's basicly the same fjord. It's called Bømlafjorden."
djiphantom,39hjha,theprez98,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:18:39 2015 UTC,Fun to see that my image is being downvoted. Why don't you rather tell me what's wrong with it? ... Thanks anyways.
djiphantom,39ge16,Lolologist,3,Thu Jun 11 15:24:35 2015 UTC,"Great learner quad and they just came out with an FPV cam for it. You can buy the camera and phone mount separately on the Syma website. This will help you get use to flying with a camera. Plus it's great if you lose sight of it like if it flies behind a tree or something. Less likely to lose it. For things to practice. .. Orbit and slide shots are key to great video so practice that. There are so many ways to shoot a slide shit so practice as many as you can think of.  Also practice keeping orientation at highs and distance. It won't take to long before orientation won't be an issue. Have fun and fly safe. I should also add that if you want the Syma to have a long life, don't be afraid to crash it, just make sure you shut off the motors before the crash so you don't have to keep replacing them."
djiphantom,39ge16,yonkfu,3,Thu Jun 11 15:52:23 2015 UTC,"Finally, someone who's doing it right. You're off to a good start already. Many new pilots don't realize that Phantoms aren't toys. There are a lot of responsibilities that come with the technology. The fact that you already realize that means you're far ahead of the standard n00b, you're an uber n00b :)  Anyway...  I recommend to most new pilots to follow this guide: http://download.dji-innovations.com/downloads/phantom_2_vision_plus/en/Phantom_2_Vision_Plus_Pilot_Training_Guide_v1.1_en.pdf  While it was written for a P2, it's lessons apply to all drones. If you can pull off these maneuvers w/o all the fancy stabilization, flying the Phantom is a piece of cake.  Once you feel like you've mastered the Syma, bust out the Phantom."
djiphantom,39ge16,the_real_djh00t,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:13:50 2015 UTC,Many new pilots don't realize that Phantoms aren't toys.   You ain't whistlin' dixie there. I'm been seeing a lot of hate on Reddit for Phantom owners and it seems to largely stem from their lack of knowledge and skill. So I want to not be one of the people that's part of the problem.  Thanks for the link to the guide!
djiphantom,39ge16,xenonsupra,3,Thu Jun 11 17:35:39 2015 UTC,"I got a syma x5c for Christmas 2014. I flew it about 10 times. Got it stuck in trees, had trouble in wind, and all sorts of other issues. I live near the water so it was always pretty windy.   Then I got a phantom 1.1.1 last month. Flying the phantom is a dream compared to the syma. The GPS assistance made it 10x easier to control and I haven't even come close to crashing.   My point is, yes the syma will help you learn the basics but the Phantom is much easier to fly and control. I'm definitely glad I got some practice in on the syma first."
djiphantom,39ge16,psychometrixo,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:00:32 2015 UTC,I'd definitely not mind being able to control something more difficult before moving to the luxury model. And I definitely will try to be capable without the GPS option in case it ever futzes out.
djiphantom,39ge16,xenonsupra,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:36:27 2015 UTC,"Don't count on that GPS.  It won't always save you.  Definitely be sure to practice on manual (or whatever the no-GPS mode is called).  Get really comfortable with at least being able to keep it airborne.    GPS glitches happen, and they happen fast.  I knew about them, I practiced, then my quad ""flew off"" and I had 4 seconds to react or lose it completely.  Now it's in pieces because I didn't listen to this advice I'm giving you.  Don't be like me.  Practice without the GPS."
djiphantom,39ge16,hey_kool_aid,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:49:13 2015 UTC,Absolutely. I feel comfortable flying in manual mode but haven't had to use it in a pinch yet.
djiphantom,39ge16,funkypiano,2,Thu Jun 11 20:33:42 2015 UTC,I did the same thing with the same quads.  The Phantom is like day and night to the Syma.  I would practice figuring out flying in different directions that is still confusing to me when trying to film and figure out how to properly control it at the same time.  You will notice the Syma doesn't handle well when you are flying higher in wind which in a way is good since you have to work harder at maintaining control.
djiphantom,39ge16,GrepZen,2,Thu Jun 11 17:48:56 2015 UTC,"I am a quad newbie, and I have had my P3A since the first shipment. I watched all the videos, including ones where people crash and mess up bad. I read all the (lousy) DJI material, and I practiced with the built-in simulator until I felt I had internalized the controls somewhat. Then I went out to the country and started flying. It is a remarkably easy craft to fly. Start slowly and in perfect conditions, and use your head, and you will be fine without the need for a second drone."
djiphantom,39ge16,McFreedom,2,Thu Jun 11 18:44:07 2015 UTC,FT has some good stuff: Flite Test - How to Fly a Multi rotor Flite Test - Aerial Photography Tips warning.. you might get hooked on many of their videos and content. --I sure did.
djiphantom,39ge16,oblommer,2,Thu Jun 11 20:18:35 2015 UTC,"I got a Phantom 2 quite recently. I flew it tethered to the light thread that it came with for about a week before I ever did anything fancy with it.   I don't like the home lock mode or course lock mode, so I fly with all that off.   Once I got the hang of taking off and landing and basic manoeuvres I started practicing flying different combinations of patterns over and over.   For example, I would fly a clockwise figure 8 a few times, and then reverse it and do it anti-clockwise for a few minutes. Then I would fly circles facing forward, followed by circles facing backward, zig zags Etc etc. I do this at different heights and different speeds, slowly building up to doing the manoeuvres at higher speeds. If you're careful you can do this in a limited space.   I've been doing at least 3 charges of practice per day for weeks and the improvement is pretty dramatic.   Doing this builds up muscle memory and you get accustomed to how to control the craft in any orientation in 3D space without thinking. I'm now pretty proficient with it, although I still think I need a few more months of practice before I can consider myself a good pilot.   So, my advice would be to learn fine control.   I did have one or two minor incidents in the beginning. I flew too close to a bush a couple of times and the drone ended up on the floor, but since it was going very slowly and very low there was no damage. I do have the prop guards, which I think are essential.   Interestingly, I've noticed that your mood or your energy levels can affect how you fly. You need a lot of concentration for this game."
djiphantom,39ge16,keystoneg,2,Thu Jun 11 20:30:56 2015 UTC,The Phantom 3 is by far the easiest aircraft I have ever flown. I was shocked at how stable it is.
djiphantom,39ge16,elijahlight,2,Sun Jun 14 07:46:54 2015 UTC,"Hey, I don't know if it's too late or if it's been mentioned already(I'm in a hurry and don't want to read all the comments). I bought Phoenix Flight simulator software for the computer. Comes with a remote and everything. You can practice for hours. No need to recharge batteries and if you crash you just hit the reset button. The physics is very accurate. The Phantoms are on the simulator. I then bought a blade qx to practice on in real life to get the blood pumping. It's a little different when you are actually worried about destroying the aircraft. When my phantom came in it was a piece of cake to fly. Hope this helped."
djiphantom,39ge16,michaelbaysux,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:19:43 2015 UTC,"Hey, what a great idea! I'm toying around with the Syma right now though I hace done some very very careful work with the Phantom already. Hoo boy is it easier to fly! But Fortunately the controls are basically the same so I'm getting used to things with the Syma. A flight sim sounds like a great idea though!"

djiphantom,39bi9y,NomadikVI,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:27:36 2015 UTC,"All good points. Thanks.  I agree on the whole longevity issue. I paid 2200 CDN for my P2 a year ago, almost to the day. (June 20th is a year).  I've got the whole thing for sale now for $1350, plus some extras and no one is interested. Can't blame them, really, but that's a HUGE depreciation, and really, there's no upgrades that make it current or relevant.   And then there's the issue that if anything happens to it, I'm totally on my own. DJI support is non existent, really, and one thing goes wrong, you've got a very expensive brick. Worst case, it just disappears and is gone forever. :/  I'll be having a closer look at the solo, for sure."
djiphantom,39bi9y,NomadikVI,-1,Thu Jun 11 00:29:31 2015 UTC,"You obviously don't have much experience with 3DR, the Iris, Gopro, or the phantom 3. All of the 3dr software is opensource and therefore all updates and fixes are on the developers timeline. 3DR has no control of it. For camera work the phantom 3 kills the gopro carrying solo. The fisheye of the gopro is so ugly and evident. I'm extremely happy with the quality and non fisheye FOV of my p3. If you think the solo is going to get you ""a great shot right away saving you time and increasing production value"" you are way off. There is nothing the solo can do that any pilot can't do."
djiphantom,39bi9y,jonny360,-1,Thu Jun 11 01:23:50 2015 UTC,"I took no offense at all. I don't care at all what you think or say. Just letting you know the facts.    I know it is so difficult to push 1 button to correct fisheye effect in post.     Wouldn't that be sweet! But nope thats not the case. Give it a try, see how the edges warp from the fisheye? Now try doing a tilt and see how the center of the image moves around the fisheye faster than the edges. Can't correct that with reverse distortion, just the way it is.      But I guess you know everything about everything, so I'll just listen to whatever you say.    Of course I dont expect you to just listen to whatever anyone says. But it would probably be wise to consider advice from those that have been there before you. I just glanced at your submissions and looks like you are just getting going in film production. Good for ya! But do try and take the edge off, there are lots of people on reddit who can offer you sound advice.   Don't take things so personal."
djiphantom,39bi9y,jonny360,0,Thu Jun 11 01:49:46 2015 UTC,"How does stating that   obviously don't have much experience with 3DR, the Iris, Gopro, or the phantom 3   come off as an insult or douchey? Do you? Then thats my mistake. But, you don't do you?   You did state your opinions... on an open forum on the internet. And I retorted with my opinions which are formed from my last two years of experience with 3DR, and multicopters, and my years of experience with gopros. Sorry if someone speaking from experience comes off as douchey to you, my bad. You are of course entitled to your opinions and you should spend your money on what you think is right for you. But you will get better footage from the p3 than with a gopro, thats a fact. As for wether you think the autonomous modes will really help you film I guess thats up to you. In my experience, while cool, they are not that necessary. Oh and what I ment to mention about the iris was that they ended up being pretty underpowered once you slapped a full gopro and gimbal on them. I've heard the solo is a much better setup. But might pay off to wait for the reviews and not be an early adopter."
djiphantom,39bi9y,jonny360,0,Thu Jun 11 05:37:44 2015 UTC,Haha you are a trip dude. It's obvious your p2 was your first copter from your posts. You don't have to lie. I'm seriously not trying to talk down to you. But anyways. Enjoy your solo. Maybe find a solo forum to post to. Might make more sense than posting about it in the phantom forum...
djiphantom,39bi9y,jonny360,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:09:25 2015 UTC,I agree. To be honest I get the geek squad accidental on all my stuff. Worst case I get stuff back in a couple weeks or they replace it. My Sony A6000 I got half off because it was a display so I bought 2 years on it and it turned out to be defective so I just had them repair it right away and now I still have 2 years and didn't pay as much for the camera.

List price on the website is $1,300 CDN, but in the fine print, it states that the gimbal is sold seperately, even though it's shown as included in the adverts. And then you need to buy a gopro.  For that money, I'll just stick with the Phantom 3. I can pick one up here for 1600 bucks, and it includes the camera and does pretty much the same thing as a Solo - and most of the stuff I have for my F2 is already compatible. :/"

djiphantom,398t6j,johnacraft,2,Wed Jun 10 22:25:42 2015 UTC,Hahaha. This was an interesting conversation to read.
djiphantom,39dahs,frowat,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:11:49 2015 UTC,Very nice! What model DJI/GoPro? Did you use any stabilization in post? It looks so smooth.
djiphantom,39dahs,Byreenie,2,Thu Jun 11 04:07:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It's with a Phantom 3 Professional. No stabilization in post, I was pretty surprised how well it help up when being sped up 4x!"
djiphantom,39bd9s,jcBoom,4,Wed Jun 10 16:42:07 2015 UTC,You do realize the UV filter is installed on the P3 straight from the factory?
djiphantom,39bd9s,YYCmax,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:13:09 2015 UTC,"... Nope. Didn't realize that. Then why does DJI advertise that it protects the lens?   ""The UV filter helps to protect the camera lens of your Phantom 3, increases the image sharpness and decreases overexposure under bright conditions."""
djiphantom,39bd9s,YYCmax,2,Wed Jun 10 18:20:16 2015 UTC,Yeah it protects the lens because you have a glass piece (filter) overtop of your lens protecting it from scratches and damage.
djiphantom,39bd9s,Ceraphas,4,Wed Jun 10 18:29:08 2015 UTC,Coming from a photography background. If it already has UV filters on it and you stack more on to it then you could be losing sharpness. I've never seen one that increased sharpness also.
djiphantom,39bd9s,TheBatmanToMyBruce,2,Wed Jun 10 18:21:49 2015 UTC,"Christ.  In photography, the question of whether or not a UV filter is a good idea is a fucking rabbit hole.  That said, protection seems like a much more pressing concern on an aircraft-mounted camera, so I'd keep it on.  But I think the one on DJI's site is just a replacement for the one that comes with the P3."
djiphantom,39bd9s,yonkfu,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:03:30 2015 UTC,Aerial photography is a little different. Higher altitudes will show much larger areas and you end up with more reflection from the ground than a nearby photo from the ground. White wash is a bigger problem when using a UAV. So I ordered the UV lens and I will post my findings after I get
djiphantom,39bd9s,TheBatmanToMyBruce,2,Wed Jun 10 20:52:39 2015 UTC,Looking forward to this. I'll hold off on buying one until I see some reviews.
djiphantom,39bd9s,yonkfu,2,Wed Jun 10 21:30:53 2015 UTC,"Theories about aerial photography aside, you're still just buying another of the same filter that comes with the P3."
djiphantom,39bd9s,yonkfu,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:29:26 2015 UTC,"Anybody have experience with UV filters?   I'm strongly considering buying one, but I'm not sure how the effect of a UV filter is different from a Polarized filter."

djiphantom,399sfq,BigFudgeMMA,2,Wed Jun 10 07:41:13 2015 UTC,"I did the same, had buyers remorse after I learned that 1080p video recorded by a 4K camera is noticeably better quality even on a 1080p display.  Sorry, I know that's probably not what you wanted to hear.   On a positive note, the 1080p video is still gorgeous and of course the phantom itself is identical except for the faster charger (which can be purchased separately).   I've let go of my buyers remorse now (especially since my P3 fell out of the sky powerless at 30ft up and now technically has NO camera, but that's a whole other story) and I'm happy with my P3 Adv."

The extra 200 bucks is worth it  to avoid buyers remorse, the 4k cam and you get the faster charger (in that order).

djiphantom,399sfq,MughalPrince22,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:03:31 2015 UTC,"I think that's still a theory, not sure if anyone has proven that yet or has direct info from DJI."

They list it as the same sensor in the specs, and have said it's the same sensor as in the Inspire, which is an Exmor IMX117CQT.    It's entirely possible however that the Advanced has a lower-power image processing chip that can't handle the throughput of 4K.  No one seems to have done a teardown and direct comparison yet.  Regardless, you're not getting any more quality at 1080p out of the Professional than you would from an Advanced."
djiphantom,399sfq,migukin,3,Wed Jun 10 20:51:22 2015 UTC,"Regardless, you're not getting any more quality at 1080p out of the Professional than you would from an Advanced.   Arguably, if the sensors were actually different, and you were shooting at 1080p, the Advanced might actually be the preferable platform depending on what you were doing (low-light, say)."
djiphantom,399sfq,the_real_djh00t,2,Wed Jun 10 22:36:13 2015 UTC,"Uses you have 4k capable monitors or computers capable of editing the huge 4k files easily, you're not missing out. I have the P3P but I still shoot in 1080 because the higher framework reduces jello and the amount of time to edit the 4k videos is ridiculous. I just got it for future proofing purposes if I get a better computer in the future."

djiphantom,397aza,WatchfulSheepdog,2,Tue Jun 9 19:46:02 2015 UTC,It's a big problem since the last firmware update. Check the DJI Forums and post your issue so DJI is aware of another owner having this problem.

Its even on DJI's approved tablet list. As mentioned in the other comment it seems firmware can help but lately new firmware has been causing bad video issues for both the phantom 3 and inspire.   Thanks for the downvote kind soul! You can see 5 pages of people having similar complaints on DJI's page right here    This is what my video has looked like at its best since day 1  So glad that some of you must be having better luck with lightbridge than others.

djiphantom,3922ee,Tachyons_for_days,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:29:04 2015 UTC,"Been meaning to post my backpack up for awhile. Had this backpack since I got my p3. Completely sold on it. The laser cut foam is much more secure than any soft walled option. It might not seem like much but being able to tighten down the props once and then leave them tight without having to take them off and on each time is great. Saves a minute of setup time and keeps the plastic prop threads from wearing out. The case will hold up to 6 batteries, 5 in compartments and 1 in the phantom. Thats more batteries than I ever plan to own. There is a large opening on one side which can hold a tablet and/or props. You can also pull these foam spacers out and add included plastic walls to make the large compartment into 3 smaller ones. The exterior of the case is heavy duty military grade and I have no question about it being able to stand up to the wear and tear I put on it. The product photos on their page make this thing look huge and I was worried about its size. I had to be able to take this backpack as carry on onto an airliner. Its way smaller than it looked. The model they used must have been tiny! This will easily fit in carry on and is very compact. And best of all is the price. I haven't seen anything close to this quality for less than $200, and this is only $170.   http://microraptorcases.com/products/backpack-designed-to-fit-the-phantom-3"

It solves basically all the problems I had with my cheapo Amazon case -- lets me keep the props on, has more than adequate storage (even space for hydration), and the outside feels durable enough to take a beating.  I would have no qualms at all about hiking or camping with it.  Good suggestion.  Edit: Forgot to add - also surprisingly comfortable to wear."

The standard carry-on allowance is 22x14x9.  The site says this bag's dimensions are 24x15x9.  I'm not saying they wouldn't allow it, but I wouldn't be comfortable relying on using it as a carry-on.  Are their dimensions wrong?  Can you give it a measuring and let us know?  Thanks."
djiphantom,3922ee,Tachyons_for_days,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:40:35 2015 UTC,I would say the dimensions listed of 24x15x9 are correct. I usually fly southwest and frontier which both list carry on size as 24x16x10. But it looks like Delta and United list 22x14x9. I'm about to take my first trip with the bag on southwest on thursday and well see how it goes. The bag looks small and i'd be surprised if they made me check the size before hand. I think you should be able to get away with taking this as carry on on most any airline. But a good catch on the size. I only checked southwest before ordering mine.

djiphantom,3919qo,arkangelz66,6,Mon Jun 8 17:39:32 2015 UTC,Chief here and drone pilot.  Good practice indicates that you not fly your rc craft over people.  I've seen enough prop/equipment failure flying these things to know how unsafe that was and how quickly that harmless drone could seriously injure someone.  Would I have turned a hose on it?  Doubt it.  Would I have tasked LE with locating the pilot and requesting he not fly over our heads?  Probably.

If any of those many spectators on the street had a camera filming the fire, the firefighters wouldn't give it a second thought.  If you want to argue that it wasn't the best judgment in deciding to fly over a house fire, I won't argue with you. Imagine if you asked ahead of time and got the OK from the fire chief. Now you're on a completely different level.  However, I think one could make a reasonable argument against what he did."

The key to getting great shots is to envision your Phantom as an aerial camera slide. Try not to rotate the camera as much as possible. The more turns, the worse. Get a stable shot and just track your subject. Also spend the extra time color correcting and planning your shots. I would also use different music, although I do love FUN.  Keep practicing at it!"

I really wish I had an SD card in it recording video at least to see if it would give some clue as to what happened.  If the video cut in mid-air for example, that could help confirm a battery problem.  I will say this, the battery level had just hit 30%.  I know because the low battery alarm had just started.

djiphantom,38zg3d,migukin,2,Mon Jun 8 16:27:36 2015 UTC,"I will take a guess that you took off without a fully charged battery???   DJI gives a warning that you should not fly on partially charged batteries for this reason. While they do a great job on making a ""smarter"" battery, it is not perfect by any means and what most likely happened is that one of the cells was out of balance which will cause a sudden power loss. Power the craft back up and you can check the load balances on the battery through the app. Even a slight  2% variance in the cells is a huge issue to fly on.   Lessons learned and this is also why to NEVER fly over people."
djiphantom,38zg3d,EODpunk,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:45:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, the flight started with a full battery, however the battery warning had just sounded, so I estimate that it was between 28-30% charge at the time of the crash.    The aircraft was in close proximity and only about 50ft high before it went down, so I was not overly concerned with the warning.  Even still, it was not my intent to keep flying any longer, I was about to bring it in.  I'm not sure what the lessons learned are yet, other than no matter how advanced, accidents can happen."

As expected, they provided me with instructions for shipping it to L.A. (everything except Props & Battery).  He also mentioned the possibility of a Control Stick Combination shutting down the motors in flight, however, he clearly stated that the CSC should NOT shut down the props when its flying! He claims that they've had unconfirmed reports that it might be possible (I don't recommend anyone try).  I stressed the point that it makes no sense that ANY combination of the control sticks to have the ability to shut down the motors in flight. The DJI Tech Rep. swiftly agreed with me that the drone should NOT allow that to happen. It would be a significant safety hazard IMHO resulting in an uncontrollable projectile, no matter how crazy that control combination was.  I'll ship it out tomorrow, and wait to see what DJI decides to do with my case in approx. 6 weeks.   I'll be sure to update the thread.

djiphantom,38zg3d,EODpunk,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:32:19 2015 UTC,"Definitely check your flight log within the pilot app. It sounds like you accidentally initiated the CSC, either both sticks down and in or out.

djiphantom,38zf2t,SuckerFreeCity,0,Mon Jun 8 23:18:14 2015 UTC,Well. The phantom does not shoot log footage.   I've been using color finale in final cut with the preset LUTs and it's worked great. I bought a LUT package from them and it helped a ton too.
djiphantom,38zf2t,TheAndrewSpence,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:41:44 2015 UTC,Um. Well what would you call the footage if not log?
djiphantom,38zf2t,TheAndrewSpence,-1,Mon Jun 8 04:58:52 2015 UTC,"Log footage refers to footage that is flat, or has the white balance baked in. So essentially, completely unsaturated/dull footage that has a lot of room for grading in the highlights and shadows.   The phantom just shoots straight up video. It's not anything special. Yes it looks amazing, but when I've taken it into Color Finale or Davinci, it is not nearly as workable as log footage from my Blackmagic camera for example.   So ultimately, LUTs do not work as well with the Phantom footage as they would with straight Log footage.   However, the ones that I have bought from Color Grading Central have proved to be worth it. So I would suggest checking them out."

My footage is completely flat and i'm honestly blown away at the dynamic range this camera captures for its price. This footage is log, it is not raw, but it is log.

djiphantom,38ynkf,Pyrphos,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:27:07 2015 UTC,Get to know your phantom. They stay exactly put and have some movement. So get to know how much and always fly a safe distance away from things you're filming. For instance I was flying and filming the side of a truck for a Comercial and a slight error and the phantom hit the truck. I didn't allow enough distance from the truck incase of an error that would make it sway a bit. 4 feet away to be exact. Now I keep more like 10 feet away and get closer post production.  Good on ya for trying to keep it safe and legal and welcom
djiphantom,38ynkf,yonkfu,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:13:30 2015 UTC,"Know your airspace.  Anything outside unrestricted airspace, class G airspace, in the US is a no go unless you have permission from the air traffic controller.  If your in another country know your air traffic laws that apply to you.  In fact a bunch of us in /r/alaska had to inform a new owner of a Phantom 3 that he broke the law by flying right next to an international airport in controlled airspace without proper permission.  You can fly with in 5 miles of airports in unrestricted airspace but you must notify those airports.  I recommend not doing this if your not familiar with all the legal issues around this stuff."
djiphantom,38ynkf,davidverner,2,Mon Jun 8 09:04:40 2015 UTC,"If you're actually following the model aircraft (and now SUAS) guidelines as put forth by the FAA (at http://knowbeforeyoufly.org/for-recreational-users/), flying within 5 miles of a an airport requires you to contact ATC (""Contact the airport or control tower before flying within five miles of an airport."")...but you don't actually need explicit permission, just only to notify them. Nor do these guidelines require you to contact ATC simply to fly in controlled airspace (although flying below 400 feet will generally keep you clear of controlled airspace anyways, except, of course, in the vicinity of airports).  Here is part of Sec. 336 of the FAA Modernization Act of 2012 (Special Rule for Model Aircraft):   (5) when flown within 5 miles of an airport, the operator of the aircraft provides the airport operator and the airport air traffic control tower (when an air traffic facility is located at the airport) with prior notice of the operation (model aircraft operators flying from a permanent location within 5 miles of an airport should establish a mutually-agreed upon operating procedure with the airport operator and the airport air traffic control tower (when an air traffic facility is located at the airport)).   So current law when flying within 5 miles of an airport requires notice, not permission.  Now, I'm sure that they'll be happy to give (or deny you) permission if you ask. But history suggests that only notification is required. In fact, the model airplane circular that the sUAS rules are based upon only ever required users to notify, not ask for permission (see item 3c). If the FAA wanted us to explicitly ask for permission, they should be more clear about it.  To be very clear, I'm not saying that your interpretation is wrong. I know from other posts that you feel very strongly about this issue. But I simply believe that your interpretation asks more of users than is actually required (or better yet, recommended--since the sUAS guidelines are only guidelines, and not laws). For example, your comments here (and in the Alaska thread) differentiate between controlled airspace and uncontrolled airspace--but the sUAS guidelines, and even the 2012 laws make no distinction when speaking about model aircraft. As I have shown above, the only relevant laws (Sec. 336) simply refer back to the guidelines."
djiphantom,38ynkf,theprez98,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:17:19 2015 UTC,"I actually pull directly from the FAA when it comes to this since you want your information mainly coming from the person who can screw you over.  While the guidelines make make no distinction on controlled and uncontrolled airspace all aircraft, no matter what type or size, must abide by the laid out regulations that the FAA have set forth.  If you don't then your at the roll of the dice to see if the FAA will notice and take action against you.  The FAA even states this in their drone myths page Myth #2:   Myth #2: Unmanned aircraft are not subject to FAA regulation.  Fact –All civil aircraft are subject to FAA regulation under law: 49 U.S.C. § 44701. For example, 14  C.F.R. part 91 applies generally to the operation of aircraft.   The other thing I want to point out is the document that you posted is out dated and was made back in the 70's or 80's and a court case decision as of last year changed a lot on how sUAS is going to be managed from now on in the US.  Lastly you need to be aware that its not just the FAA that can bite you in the ass.  Local laws can get you just as good as the FAA."
djiphantom,38ynkf,davidverner,2,Mon Jun 8 12:59:48 2015 UTC,"I actually pull directly from the FAA when it comes to this since you want your information mainly coming from the person who can screw you over.   I agree. Perhaps you didn't realize, then, that knowbeforeyoufly.org is an FAA-cooperative site. If you didn't, you know now. :)  As for the drone myths, page, that's essentially a press release and not a statement of the current law or regulations. This page has actually been subject to some ridicule for it's accuracy, or lack thereof. Mr. Sachs is well-respected for his knowledge of drone laws, so I personally give his opinion considerable weight.   The other thing I want to point out is the document that you posted is out dated and was made back in the 70's or 80's and a court case decision as of last year changed a lot on how sUAS is going to be managed from now on in the US.   I'm very well aware of the date of the document. I cited it for historical purposes (that's why I used the word ""history""), as it is the foundation for the current guidelines.  Bottom line: the FAA rules are confusing and sometimes appear to contradict themselves. It is not at all clear what we're supposed to be doing to be ""in the clear."" You and I have obvious disagreements about the scope of what's required. That's all.  The court case you cited was an NTSB decision, and was ultimately settled out of court with Mr. Pirker. This is a decision of an administrative agency--it never even reached an Article III court so I personally don't put any weight in this decision, but YMMV.   For better or worse, here in Maryland, the state recently passed a law which prohibits local jurisdictions from imposing regulations on drones.  Bottom line: the FAA's rules are confusing and in some places, appear to contradict themselves. You and I have differing opinions on the scope of what's required; that's all."

It will most likely need to be shipped back to DJI for repairs and I doubt they will cover any of the cost.  It will probably be EXPENSIVE and take quite awhile.    Sorry... that really sucks.

Here in Sweden we have somehting called ""Drulleförsäkring"" and that translates to ""Idiot/Fool Insurance"" or something like that.   That means that if you are out flying your quad and crashes it while flying being stupid - your insurance will cover it.   My deductible is pretty high though, $150 so I try not to take any stupid chances while I'm out flying. :)"
djiphantom,38o46w,OfficerUlcer,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:53:00 2015 UTC,Insurance for remote controlled aircraft must be a terrible business even with a $150 deductible it seems like they would lose money.

djiphantom,38m5n3,MonsieurAnon,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:15:47 2015 UTC,"Don't listen to anyone else. Everyone seems to think that you need some dedicated case for your Phantom. Have a look at a Deuter AirContact hiking backpack. The spine frame of the mid sized models fits the top of a Phantom neatly, which means that it's protected from most impacts ... plus you'll naturally be surrounding it with clothes for added protection."
djiphantom,38m5n3,rick_snagwell,0,Sat Jun 6 22:03:43 2015 UTC,"Drones are banned in all national parks.  Having said that I will address your question about the case.  You'll definitely want a backpack for hiking.  There is the new hardshell case which I'd recommend, but they are not available at the moment unless you want a knock-off.  A soft backpack that seems like a good option is the Vanguard up-rise ii 46 or 48.  They go for $120-160 new.  I just got the 46 model on ebay for $49 last week.  There are also many backpacks ranging from cheap to very expensive... just check amazon.    This guy built a pretty sweet case for $100"

djiphantom,38n3vw,Sparky_299,3,Fri Jun 5 07:52:07 2015 UTC,"I watched about half.  Looks pretty rough, imo.  I would practice setting up shots to get some really nice composition and framing.  Work on flying with fluid movements and laying of the yaw (rotate) stick.  There were some really nice shots that could have been cut a few seconds earlier to remove some jerky movements.  Congrats for getting out and filming.  Keep flying!"
djiphantom,38n3vw,OfficerUlcer,3,Fri Jun 5 14:13:13 2015 UTC,Thanks!
djiphantom,38n3vw,jonny360,2,Fri Jun 5 14:24:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with Voltwan,   Try using steadier shots. IMO, you should not realize you are watching from a drone, the content is supposed to be the main focus. Any movements from the drone detract from what you are trying to shoot. I also think copter footage is meant to be slowed down or sped up. Twixtor is a great program for frame blending and time remapping. Do a little google on pacing for editing as well. Music is also key to video, I found it did not match the content. (I spend more time searching for the right song than editing sometimes)   Flying tip: fly to the maximum distance in your range, and fly backwards to eliminate the props in the upper FOV. You can also reverse the footage if there are no moving things in your shot that will disorientate the viewer.   That second last shot was mint, keep it up."
djiphantom,38k8r2,eddiepants,3,Thu Jun 4 19:38:47 2015 UTC,"It's your $150 worth.  I'd be worried about the temperature gradient causing damage though, and shortening the life span/shorting it out.  The core's going to retain the heat the longest. Air cooling, the whole thing cools at a similar rate.  With refrigerated cooling, the outside cools rapidly and contracts, but the core stays hotter longer.  Don't know how that will affect the battery."
djiphantom,38k8r2,DwarvenRedshirt,2,Thu Jun 4 21:10:12 2015 UTC,"This. Also, I would worry about condensation. Unsure if that's a real issue here. But when I put warm lasagna in the fridge it creates a shitload of condensation in my tupperware."

djiphantom,38k8r2,cbdudek,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:33:03 2015 UTC,Freezing might cause a slight degradation to LiPo batteries but I'm not certain it will have any affect after the duration of the cold temperature. I might be mistaken.  You might want to ask /r/AskElectronics.
djiphantom,38k8r2,DrSalted,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:52:09 2015 UTC,"I've done this a few times, but only for like 10 minutes at a time.  If you think about it, a refrigerator is around 40 degrees, which is not quite freezing especially if you stick it in the door.  If they were that sensitive, simply taking them outside on a cold day would be bad for them.  Just my thoughts, I could be wrong."
djiphantom,38k8r2,tester86,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:03:21 2015 UTC,"The threshold for charging them warm seems to be pretty high anyway, so I've always just waited a few minutes until it's only moderately warm and charged from there. To me, the potential reward of gaining that ~5-10 minutes isn't worth the risk of wearing the battery down faster or otherwise damaging it.  Would be very interested to hear your long term results if you do it and measure the difference in how quick you can start charging again and also maybe some of your battery parameters from the pilot app too."
djiphantom,38k8r2,Encosia,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:00:58 2015 UTC,"I've put the battery in the freezer for 5 minutes (timed) to cool it down, and I haven't seen any issues, but it might degrade it over time. When I'm out, I put it on my defroster vents and turn on the AC."

djiphantom,38l4ie,LikeABausss,2,Fri Jul 10 00:40:53 2015 UTC,"The problem is still there but less in frequency now. I used Multirom to install both cm12.1 and exodus ROM. I use exodus as my daily driver but when DJI pilot doesn't connect with it I'll switch back and forth between the two and usually it connects eventually. Also in the adb settings I always connect as a camera instead of MTP. The latest firmware and app version seem to work the best for me. Finally, make sure you keep your RAM and CPU clear as possible when flying. There are some guides on phantomhelp.com. Bottom line is I can get my setup to work perfectly but it takes some effort to get that stable connection. I might get a cheap nexus 7 II to use instead."
djiphantom,38l4ie,LikeABausss,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:13:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks a bunch, man. Have you heard from people that the nexus 7 has a lot less problems with the app?

djiphantom,38incz,yonkfu,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:28:17 2015 UTC,How do you figure they charge fast for the size? All lipos can charge at 1c and usually above. 1c of any battery size takes 1 hour to charge.

Also, someone posted on the DJI Forums how to store a full size tablet without modification. The guy basically removed the foam on the top of the backpack and places the tablet where the foam goes.  Then he puts the foam back in, on top of the tablet."

djiphantom,38ilzh,Ceraphas,3,Thu Jun 4 13:38:37 2015 UTC,I say speed up the slide transitions and end it right after the last image slides off. Otherwise I like it
djiphantom,38ilzh,optimous012,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:25:14 2015 UTC,Awesome. I left the bit at the end for popping in titles and stuff so it will have something there once I put this in a video. I just haven't gone out since I made this haha
djiphantom,38ilzh,Solkre,2,Thu Jun 4 16:26:16 2015 UTC,"I'd just have the logo and the title, and speed it up.  I'm assuming it would never play that long anyway.  KBHD does it right, and it's over by 4 seconds.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrzhzCA1NUw"
djiphantom,38fuis,Ludachris9000,2,Wed Jun 3 22:58:36 2015 UTC,Looks like a great fit! But would it be better to place the strap under the remote's antenna?
djiphantom,38fuis,Zubiee,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:18:10 2015 UTC,..first thing I noticed too!
djiphantom,38fuis,dimovelijah,2,Fri Jun 5 16:49:30 2015 UTC,Loving that backpack. Just waiting for mine. Wish the drone logo said DJI.
djiphantom,38fuis,keithkman,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:34:38 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/05ID5wU  Plenty of room yet very compact. I'd say it's a bit bigger than an average backpack.
djiphantom,38fuis,rick_snagwell,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:00:27 2015 UTC,Uggghhh... I was at work when FedEx came by.  I have to wait until tomorrow :(
djiphantom,38g0i7,NoRemorse920,2,Wed Jun 3 23:39:28 2015 UTC,"I got mine from Amazon yesterday. I complained about the shifting ship dates a couple weeks ago and they gave me $50 to stick around. Might be worth sending a note yourself. Happy I waited, always more comfortable with ordering from them."
djiphantom,38g0i7,pbrowntv,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:03:19 2015 UTC,july now.
djiphantom,38g0i7,rick_snagwell,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:42:39 2015 UTC,"Got mine from DJI, but don't know how delayed they are now."
djiphantom,38g0i7,DwarvenRedshirt,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:22:55 2015 UTC,I eventually just bailed on Amazon and ordered through coptershop.com and I got my Phantom 3 shipped that day.  I bought the battery separate from DJI with the backpack which I got today.  I am glad I bailed hearing most people who ordered the same combo are still in a waiting game for their drone/battery combo.
djiphantom,38g0i7,cbdudek,2,Thu Jun 4 14:38:25 2015 UTC,"I needed this comment. Just canceled my order, and upgraded to the pro from coptershop with next day air shipping. I'm done waiting."
djiphantom,38g0i7,genpub,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:42:35 2015 UTC,I ordered mine from DJI and it took 2 weeks to arrive. The extra battery was just shipped and will arrive within 3 weeks of placing my order.
djiphantom,38f84d,RatherTall,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:38:12 2015 UTC,"If you could clarify a few things it would help:   I need an fpv system   Are you looking for an add-on FPV system to attach to a quad, or are you looking for an integrated system?    Ideally, I'd be able to output 1280 x 800 video   Output to what? A monitor? Or do you just want to record at that resolution? Why specifically 1280x800?"
djiphantom,38f84d,Tachyons_for_days,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:46:15 2015 UTC,"An add on system, yes.   I need to feed a video switcher receiving hdmi or sdi at at least 1280x720"
djiphantom,38f84d,Tachyons_for_days,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:33:32 2015 UTC,Do you need this video to be live?
djiphantom,38f84d,Tachyons_for_days,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:19:31 2015 UTC,Yes
djiphantom,38f84d,Bad-Science,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:18:50 2015 UTC,"Broadcast-quality live video from a Phantom is...unlikely.  You would probably need a larger airframe, and at least a few thousand dollars worth of gear to accomplish it.  That's why everyone uses low-quality live previews, and records directly to a card on the aircraft."
djiphantom,38f84d,yonkfu,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:49:59 2015 UTC,Oh I'll be doing that too. This is an isolated event and I'll be renting equipment for it. It looks like the light bridge is my best bet.
