I'm having trouble remembering all of them now, as I'm on season six, but the three I remember are: -The beginning of Season 4 Audition Day, when Pete goes ""Assuming nothing goes wrong in the next 8 hours,"" Liz looks directly into the camera and shakes her head -Season 4 again (my favorite season), and now i can't remember what episode, but Liz is listing what she's going to do that night to Jack, and as she's doing that the camera cuts to Jack for one second and he's mouthing the same list back to her.  -And I've just spent way too long trying to locate the last quote and can't find it so I give up."

30ROCK,3dsyqb,luciferthecat10,53,Sun Jul 19 03:56:36 2015 UTC,"Compiling this list took me nearly two months. I went back and watch every episode of 30 Rock. I may have missed one or two references, so please, if you can think of any more, tell me.  Here are some references that I could not include in the pictures.   In Season 3, Episode 21, Kenneth knows the words to the songs that are sung, including Tracy's song, which sounds as though it is medieval.  Kenneth can speak latin, as demonstrated in Season 4, Episode 4. This could imply that his soul has been alive since Roman times.    Ok, now time for some theories.  The majority of the references to the immortality appear at the beginning of the season and peter out towards the end. They do not appear at all during the first and second seasons. I believe this is because Kenneth's immortality was always the end plan for the series. By the time the show was picked up for a new season, more often than not, there were no more mentions of immortality. One notable exception is the end of season 5. This could be because the writers thought they were going into their last season. The lack of references in seasons one and two could either be from lack of character development or because the writers did not think the show would end until at least the third season. The reason for the dearth of references in season 7 is because the writers knew it would be the last season, and wanted to have the ending come somewhat as a surprise. That could be one of the reasons why Kenneth's mother and Ron were introduced, so she could further cement his immortality (especially because many of their characteristics go against how Kenneth has described them ).  The immortality has rendered several plotlines incorrect. For example, the season 6, episode one storyline when Kenneth thinks the world is going to end. Kenneth has a direct line to God, whom he calls ""Jacob"". Kenneth would have actual knowledge about the world ending and would know that it was not going to happen.  Edit: Season 4, Episode 9- Kenneth cannot use technology whatsoever."

30ROCK,3dsyqb,red3biggs,9,Sun Jul 19 06:16:40 2015 UTC,"Great list! Though there may be some more. Under ""Age"" on Kenneth's wikipedia page there are some instances that suggest immortality as well. I pulled out the ones you did already, these are the others:  In ""Subway Hero"", to Jack's puzzlement, Kenneth recognizes Bucky Bright, a celebrity who was described as being active in the ""40s and 50s"".  Similarly, in the episode ""Verna"", Kenneth states that The Today Show has not been as good since chimpanzee J. Fred Muggs was featured on the show, implying that he watched the program when the primate served as the show's mascot, which was from 1953 to 1957.  In ""Queen of Jordan"", Kenneth's chyron reads ""Kenneth Parcell: Elderly Page""  In ""Respawn"", while talking to Jack he states in his apartment there are only white cockroaches while pointing to himself indicating that he is unable to die.  In ""Meet the Woggels!"", Kenneth reveals that the only Rock and Roll song he has ever listened to is Mr. Sandman, which was released in 1954, and, during the time it debuted, was considered to be of the Rock and Roll genre.  Also, his tombstone"

30ROCK,3cc5pa,Harryshotterdad,8,Tue Jul 7 01:31:47 2015 UTC,"In many ways, Jack and Liz have the same core problem. Liz is searching for a romantic interest and Jack, while satisfied sexually/romantically, needs companionship.  They don't seem like they suffer from the same unhappiness but they actually do. We see episodes where they try to change who they are, exist without love/friendship and always fail. Liz falls in love with Chris, and Jack makes friends not only with Liz but all of the TGS staff.   I remember Tina Fey discussing how they wanted to give him a montage, where he explores the world in a very Donaghy style, but realized how important he was to the TGS Staff now. His disappearance would hurt Liz and the rest of the cast. And that really, to me, explains the difference between Pilot Jack and Finale Jack. One is new, hated and trying to change something special. The other recognizes that he shouldn't meddle, because he's part of something special and can contribute as a member and not an outsider."

And... you get the idea. The show has so many subtle gags and things that are hard to see on the first (or second or third) viewing, and things in earlier seasons that allude to later seasons, and just so much great stuff, making multiple viewings almost mandatory (like a Liz Lemon Party)."
