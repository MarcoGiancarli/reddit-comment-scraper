For this milkshake, I used three different sizes white marshmallow (extra large, medium and the mini ones that are being served in a small bowl). I used Ghirardelli Dark Chocolate.  ~ I pre-roasted my marshmallows in a toaster oven (set at broiler for under one minute. You cannot walk away from this step, or the marshmallows will burn). When done, place the toasted marshmallows on the side to cool off a bit.   ~ assembly - this step is the easy part. """

I know I certainly couldn't make a realistic looking octopus, out of anything, really. Most other people probably can't either, so I'm sure those people probably appreciate the effort put into this piece, as well. The birthday girl certainly did.

I want you to quote me on this... Oh you can't because I never said that, so don't make shit up. What I'm saying is, this isn't ""dessert porn"", it's not on par with most things on this sub. It's just a cake covered in fondant that has edible paint on it. And no, cutting a cake in the form of an octopus isn't hard, it's literally a circle with tentacles."
DessertPorn,3dvvl1,PeacefulCamisado,2,Mon Jul 20 20:03:05 2015 UTC,"I suppose I figured that saying that it isn't impressive is synonymous to saying that they don't deserve recognition--after all, if anyone can do it, why bother featuring it? However, I really do apologize.   I agree that it's not quite the same as what is normally posted to this sub--it is more of a work of art, rather than something that makes your mouth water (although the thought of that sweet chocolate mudcake in the middle makes me desire some chocolate). However, it is still an impressive piece of delicious sweets, so I think it's okay to have it on the subreddit.    The creator claims they spent at least two days making this--this was mainly spent on the smaller detail of its suction cups, but this was still an impressive piece of effort to place into this cake--they didn't have to do that, but they did. And while one can make a circle with little 'tentacles' popping out of it, I don't think everyone can make it look like a real octopus--perhaps something a bit more cartoony, sure, but not like this."

DessertPorn,3czmci,ELwain66,3,Sun Jul 12 07:28:36 2015 UTC,I started with the [Nigella's Brownie Recipe](ww.food.com/recipe/nigella-lawson-brownies-32053).    I used Gluten Free Flour to replace the plain flour.    Replaced the 300g of walnuts with 500 g of chocolate chips.   And it took almost twice as long to cook as I expected - so keep testing it for doneness with a toothpick.

DessertPorn,3cvptv,OneThinDime,3,Sat Jul 11 04:17:41 2015 UTC,Looks great. Recipe please!
DessertPorn,3cvptv,JoiningTheDotz,5,Sat Jul 11 07:31:19 2015 UTC,"3 ripe Georgia peaches  3/4 cup flour  1 1/2 cup sugar  Tablespoon honey, teaspoon ground cinnamon  1 Lemon  1/2 cup milk  1/4 stick of unsalted butter  Teaspoon baking powder  Dash of salt  I used an 8 inch cast iron skillet for this. Place skillet in oven and heat to 375.   Halve the peaches and remove the seeds. Make about 10 thin, pretty slices then cube the rest. Reserve the slices and put the cubed peaches into saucepan over medium low heat. Add 3/4 cup sugar, the juice from the lemon, the honey and the cinnamon. Stir occasionally, tasting often. After about ten minutes or so you'll have a thick syrup but the peaches will still be slightly firm.  Add the butter to the skillet that should still be in the 375 degree oven. Leave it there.   In bowl mix 1/2 cup sugar, 3/4 cup flour, teaspoon baking powder, then whisk in 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup milk. Batter will be a bit thin.   Remove the heated skillet with the melted butter from the oven and pour in the batter. Pour in the peaches and syrup but do not stir into batter. Place pretty peach slices over the top and very carefully transfer back to oven. Leave about 1/4 inch of room from the top of your skillet for rising.   Bake at 375 until a toothpick inserted in the cobbler comes out clean, or until it turns golden brown, or whenever it just feels right. 20-25 minutes should do it. Sprinkle with additional cinnamon.  Let it cool a little and serve with the best vanilla ice cream you can find."

(This is for one batch. I used two for the cake.)  You beat six room temperature egg yolks until they are pale yellow and thick and creamy.   Then you pour the sugar syrup down the side of the mixer bowl slowly into the yolks.   After it whips enough (~5mins) so the bottom of the bowl is cool, you start to add in pieces of room temperature butter (4 sticks).   I then added around a tablespoon of caramel extract, a bit of vanilla, and salt to taste. :D   ** edit - I also made a caramel sauce to drizzle on top for added visual effect, which was just homemade caramel (sugar heated up until golden enough) a bit of cream, and some butter to make it shinier."

DessertPorn,3bwmez,MiaaMariaa,2,Thu Jul 2 19:25:28 2015 UTC,"Makes 12  INGREDIENTS  DOUGH  2 ¬º teaspoon active dry yeast  1 cup warm milk (I used skim)  ¬Ω cup granulated sugar  1/3 cup margarine (room temperature)  1 teaspoon salt  2 eggs (room temperature)  4 cups all-purpose flour  FILLING  ¬Ω cup margarine  1 ¬º cups packed light brown sugar  2 ¬Ω tbs cinnamon  2 tbs cornstarch  ICING  4oz (1/2 cup) softened cream cheese  1 cup icing sugar  ¬º cup margarine  ¬Ω tsp vanilla extract  METHOD  Warm milk in microwave for 45 seconds  Stir in 1 teaspoon of the granulated sugar  Stir the yeast into the milk and let sit for 5 minutes (milk should become bubbly)  While the yeast mixture is sitting combine all dry ingredients (salt, sugar, flour). Whisk the two eggs and add to dry ingredients. Add margarine and combine all ingredients with a spatula.   Slowly combine the yeast mixture in with the dough with a spatula.   Once your mixture starts to form more of a dough it is best to work it with lightly floured hands. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and knead until you have a dense ball.  Place dough into a greased bowl (I used pam to coat the bowl and my dough), cover with saran wrap and then a tea towel and let rise till doubled (60 minutes).  Combine dry ingredients for filling and set aside.  Grease either a large cookie sheet, or 2 9x13 baking dishes. ‚Äì I used margarine.  Once the dough has risen, punch it down with your hands and place it on your lightly floured work surface. Roll out the dough until it is approximately 21 inches long by 16 inches wide (approx. ¬º inch thick).  Spread margarine onto the dough ‚Äì leaving a 1 inch bare strip at the end furthest away from you (you will coat this with water which will help with sealing the roll).   Sprinkle (generously) the cinnamon/brown sugar/cornstarch mixture on top of the margarine ‚Äì (I didn‚Äôt end up using the full amount this time but I definitely will the next time I make the buns).   Take a rolling pin and press the dry mixture into the dough, rolling back and forth until smooth.  Working carefully, begin rolling up the dough from the longest edge. Cover the 1 inch strip that you bare, with some warm water and press to seal.  Using tooth floss (if you don‚Äôt have any floss handy I would suggest using a serrated bread knife) slice the log in half (placing the tooth floss under your dough, wrapping the floss around the dough, and slicing through with a criss-cross motion). Divide each half into 6 pieces using the same method with the floss. You can either discard the end pieces or include them in with your baking as filler.  Place your rolls into your baking dishes ‚Äì leave at least a 1-2 inch space between each roll. Cover with oiled saran wrap and let rise for 1 hour.  Preheat your oven to 375‚ÄôF, place rack in center of the oven and bake for 15 ‚Äì 20 minutes until they are a light golden brown.  With a electric hand mixer: Whisk cream cheese, butter & vanilla extract. Slowly incorporate icing sugar.  Immediately cover with half of the frosting and let it melt (this insures ooey gooey cinnamon buns) and top with the remaining when you want to devour them.  Enjoy!!!!!!!!  If you have any questions just ask! I am not the best at typing out recipes!"

DessertPorn,3btjcl,polkadotjammies,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:17:58 2015 UTC,It was mango flavored the kiwi was a garnish
DessertPorn,3bs0lu,jenks285,8,Wed Jul 1 18:00:26 2015 UTC,I like that you made them to look like fruit wedges.
DessertPorn,3bs0lu,MisoPlas,4,Wed Jul 1 19:44:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I saw something similar online using oranges and decided to try out the lemon/lime version."
DessertPorn,3bs0lu,PokerKitteh2,4,Wed Jul 1 20:14:12 2015 UTC,Tipsy bartender? That's where I saw the orange wedged jello shots.
DessertPorn,3bs0lu,DidntHaveToUseMyAK,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:38:30 2015 UTC,I can't remember...it may have been a post on Pinterest. I will definitely have to check out Tipsy Bartender though! :-)
DessertPorn,3bs0lu,bumble-butt,2,Wed Jul 1 22:45:08 2015 UTC,"I make specialty jello shots for events all the time! A tip for next time - You'd be better off just using lemons with different colors of jello. I don't know about you but for me getting all of the guts out of lime rinds was a real pain in the ass, and people didn't want them as much as the lemons due to size difference. I also hope you mixed in some of the fruit juices in place of the vodka/water mixture! Otherwise yours look really well done!"
DessertPorn,3bs0lu,bumble-butt,-11,Thu Jul 2 04:20:04 2015 UTC,Jell-O shots are definitely not a dessert.
DessertPorn,3bs0lu,emdiz,17,Wed Jul 1 18:44:31 2015 UTC,Understandable. Wasn't sure where to post this. But in all fairness....in my family booze is definitely a dessert.

DessertPorn,3bs0lu,emdiz,14,Wed Jul 1 20:17:10 2015 UTC,jell-o = dessert
DessertPorn,3bs0lu,bumble-butt,2,Wed Jul 1 21:37:47 2015 UTC,There is a difference between jell-o and jell-o shots.
DessertPorn,3bs0lu,emdiz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:43:46 2015 UTC,but they are both made with jell-o.
DessertPorn,3bs0lu,AllAmericanBriFi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:48:11 2015 UTC,"Jell-O shots are not intended to be a dessert, though. They are an alcoholic novelty ""beverage"". You eat them to get wasted, not as an after-dinner treat."
DessertPorn,3bquex,Samiiya,3,Wed Jul 1 12:20:49 2015 UTC,They look awesome! I'd be surprised if that was your first time - they look almost professional!
DessertPorn,3bquex,kbjack85,3,Wed Jul 1 16:20:27 2015 UTC,Thank you! Second time actually...I used these as Christmas presents. Edible glitter really makes it pop.
DessertPorn,3bquex,DingDongSeven,2,Wed Jul 1 17:08:52 2015 UTC,That's gorgeous. I've tried making truffles. Once...   Very nicely done. Respect.
DessertPorn,3bquex,felifae,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:03:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you! They could be a little tricky but I would take making truffles over baking cookies any day! The Bailey's were the most popular and very easy to make so if you'd like to make a second attempt i'd just go with different variations of these. Roll some in coconut, shaved dark chocolate, melted dark chocolate, shaved white chocolate, sugar glitter...oh boy."

DessertPorn,3bl9wv,Dexxy85,-1,Tue Jun 30 03:29:48 2015 UTC,They look good but why are the sprinkles not evenly dispersed on the cookie?
DessertPorn,3bl9wv,luckylemony,2,Tue Jun 30 08:12:40 2015 UTC,"Because Art?    Really, I was faffing about with the icing and started with the standard sprinklinkg of the sprinkles, but icing started to set so I poured the sprinkles onto a plate and pressed the cookies onto them - this was the result."

DessertPorn,3bl9wv,Hotnonsense,2,Tue Jun 30 18:18:10 2015 UTC,"It was based on Kittencal's recipe but i swapped out about quarter of a cup of flour for Dutch process cocoa - maybe a bit more - it was the end of the jar.  The icing is just standard royal icing (egg white, icing sugar and lemon juice) with gel colouring."

DessertPorn,3bewpq,fourcheesehotpocket,8,Sun Jun 28 16:30:21 2015 UTC,Too much icing (that doesn't look like whipped cream) for my taste. I prefer a more even strawberry/angel food cake/whipped cream ratio.
DessertPorn,3bewpq,GoatintheOakTree,2,Sun Jun 28 20:39:26 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't know this looks like a run of the mill previously frozen diner cake to me.

Seriously, the amount of effort that goes into these things for what amounts to a single bite on a stick is ridiculous. Starbucks charges something like $2 for one of these...  John Oliver should do a ""Why Is This Still A Thing?"" segment on cake pops."

DessertPorn,3axyb0,carydog,7,Wed Jun 24 22:59:32 2015 UTC,Recipe by popular demand! Also I went to sleep after posting this. Apologies for keeping you all up.    Dissolve 3 gelatin leaves in cool water for 5 minutes.  Meanwhile 300ml coconut cream + 1/4 cup sugar + seeds from a vanilla pod. Heat over low until sugar dissolved. Take off heat and set aside to cool. Squeeze water out from gelatin and add to warm coconut cream. Stir until dissolved. Whip 300mL of cream. Add coconut cream. Stir/whisk until combined. Pour into moulds and set in fridge for at least 4 hours.
