I've had coworkers flirt in front of me and generally I find it annoying if I can't escape and not be involved, lol.  BUT...Are you a black man? I'm sure she was upset because she probably expected you to hit on her. It probably didn't even register in her mind that the black girl was attractive to anyone until you stepped in, so now she is struggling since this kind of situation doesn't fit into her racial schema, lol.  The older I get...the less I enjoy being around white women. :/ I see how petty they can be, how competitive they are, how much they manipulate other people, and I just don't like it. I have noticed that if a white girl is REALLY invested in being friends with me, she is probably trying to use me.  They are always doing some silly shit, too. This one white girl I thought I was cool with came into the bathroom one day, saw my hair right after I fixed then, TOUCHED IT, then said it ""looked like Eraserhead"". I don't know but a lot of them are just really invested in touching my body as a black woman and I just want them to kind of GTF away from me.  I just get along better with women of color. I mean, I have met some white girls that are cool to be around but they are few and far in between in my experience."

Both intersectional, tryly anti racist good people who don't have the ME ME ME virus that afflicts the average white girl.   But I also (knew) the sort of White girl you describe. Dropped several from my life. They really cannot grok not being the center of the universe. Thats not a gut feeling on your part but an accurate observation. Whiteness teaches them that they are the peak ideal of womanhood, the most beautiful women on earth (by their own standards conveniently) and so on. And its especially validating that so many men of color have swallowed that nonsense and are supposed to walk over women of color, especially Black women, to get to them  So when you didnt do so, you flipped a switch. I too ahve seen it play out like that more than once. I see it even just mentioning my SO is white around some white women, even online. They get cold, snappy and suddenly shady and hypercritical.  They're supposed to be held above us. You upset the pecking order."
blackladies,3e4km7,IrbyTremor,2,Tue Jul 21 23:30:48 2015 UTC,"All my relationships with white women have been pleasant so far. I think this is mainly because I live in a more diverse setting so I don't get to meet a lot of white women who are...abhorrent, for lack of a better term (I live in California). This thread made me realize I know more WoC than white women, haha.    white girl almost seemed offended by the entire situation. she would habitually interrupt the black girl, try to hijack the conversation, and would say passive aggressive stuff like reacting so surprised when the black girl mentioned how good her grades in college are. I don't even think she was remotely interested in me (I'm pretty sure she has a boyfriend), it just seemed like she didn't want a black girl to get attention over her. this isn't the first time this type of thing has played itself out in front of me. Am I imagining a dynamic that doesn't exist? I don't want to limit this to relationships or dating.   Are you attractive, OP? IMO, I think that there's this misconception that attractive black guys/any black guy want any and all white women. And I feel like social media has bolstered this misconception (because most black men are with other black women) so maybe she thought you'd be all over her? By her own body language and behavior she's already assigned the black girl's worth in relation to her in her own mind and probably thought you would too, but you didn't. I really don't understand the competitiveness either? Why is she so concerned with competing/showing up the black girl? She doesn't have anything to gain."

blackladies,3e0gpo,wafflebread,14,Tue Jul 21 03:43:24 2015 UTC,"I just found this:   For those of you asking what happened, These the people New Blacks who made that post, that attacked Amandla for giving her thoughts on the Tuition problem, made her take a break from tumblr.   [ http://brokebitchantics.tumblr.com http://ogxayxay.tumblr.com/post/ ] The post went, Telling her   “amandla you could pay for a few students college ya damn self fuck is you sayin”…   “I don’t like that post talmbout “oh minion money could be used on people’s college tuition” cause it’s coming from someone who ain’t even gone have to pay for college by doing half the shit other people gotta do.”  And Amandla responded: “yall really don’t get that I’m broke like damn I need donations to be able to go to college tbh”— “I’m so exhausted of ppl tryna come for me. I’m taking a break from tumblr peace”  A black girl, 16, trying to speak on the problems in the world to Protect Black culture, She a soldier out there fighting for us, out there in public in the open, using the voice she was given as an actress to actively speak on these issues, which None of your Faves Do. None of them. But this Girl we can support so easily She has her own people coming at her like that? Ya couldn’t let something go? Ya have to Find SOMETHING to speak on? It was a valid point too that’s the thing I don’t understand. She wasn’t just speaking about minions advertisement, she was given minions as an example for a bigger picture. She’s saying some money from industries could be taken from them as a form of tax to make college tuition free. She’s not saying Just that one Minion movie could Pay for Everyone’s Tuition in the whole fuckin united states. Little girl out here having bigger thoughts than your grown asses coming for her.   So I think what happened is that tumblr user brokebitchantics made that half-joke about amandla being rich. Then I guess a bunch of other people took that joke very seriously and starting yelling at Amandla. So now she's taking a tumblr break. A lot of people are also defending Amandla. brokebitchantics I think is apologetic and didn't think things would get taken this far.

blackladies,3e0gpo,catofnortherndarknes,5,Tue Jul 21 00:49:44 2015 UTC,"so basically..........   amandla made a tweet about how the money made in the minions movie could have gone to someone's college education tumblr user brokebitchantics responding (im assuming in a joking manner) how amandla was rich anyways so she didnt have to deal with paying for college a bunch of other people used that to get on her ass and attack her  she's on a hiatus now. people are also saying this is probably the tipping point as she's also been under fire from the media for coming for kylie and being called a jackhole by the cohen dude from ROHA   here's the exerpt from another person who compiled everything that happened:   For those of you asking what happened, These the people New Blacks who made that post, that attacked Amandla for giving her thoughts on the Tuition problem, made her take a break from tumblr. [ http://brokebitchantics.tumblr.com http://ogxayxay.tumblr.com/post/ ] The post went, Telling her “amandla you could pay for a few students college ya damn self fuck is you sayin”… “I don’t like that post talmbout “oh minion money could be used on people’s college tuition” cause it’s coming from someone who ain’t even gone have to pay for college by doing half the shit other people gotta do.” And Amandla responded: “yall really don’t get that I’m broke like damn I need donations to be able to go to college tbh”— “I’m so exhausted of ppl tryna come for me. I’m taking a break from tumblr peace” A black girl, 16, trying to speak on the problems in the world to Protect Black culture, She a soldier out there fighting for us, out there in public in the open, using the voice she was given as an actress to actively speak on these issues, which None of your Faves Do. None of them. But this Girl we can support so easily She has her own people coming at her like that? Ya couldn’t let something go? Ya have to Find SOMETHING to speak on? It was a valid point too that’s the thing I don’t understand. She wasn’t just speaking about minions advertisement, she was given minions as an example for a bigger picture. She’s saying some money from industries could be taken from them as a form of tax to make college tuition free. She’s not saying Just that one Minion movie could Pay for Everyone’s Tuition in the whole fuckin united states. Little girl out here having bigger thoughts than your grown asses coming for her."

I said this in the hhh thread, but I can't think of any other rapper who sounds so much like another rapper. I'm surprised Ghostface didn't call him out before. Not sure how long this will last, but I'm here for it."

NuRap fans. They have no idea how beefs work  Yes, Ghost is going to kill him  ON A TRACK. Lol buncha clueless suburban 17 year olds have no idea. Did thwy not hear Torture? Do they think Wu really went out and tortured their rivals?"
blackladies,3e0y9m,meadeater2014,4,Tue Jul 21 05:58:02 2015 UTC,"I was cracking up when I saw his post! Him posting it on reddit is too funny.    Whenever there's any beef, no matter how minor, hhh expresses their hope that it doesn't turn violent. Someone will inevitably remind everyone their favorite rappers are from the hood.  It's always the same, lol."
blackladies,3e0y9m,Guerrillaz,3,Tue Jul 21 06:37:42 2015 UTC,Lol the accuracy!
blackladies,3e0y9m,extroire,4,Tue Jul 21 06:52:31 2015 UTC,Girl yes. I've been waiting with baited breath. I love how he went at Action over a Teddy Pendergrass track.   hhh is talking about it too. I hope Action gets boycotted. It happened to Iggy and ended her career. We'll see what happens next.

blackladies,3e0y9m,cardboardsoles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:55:20 2015 UTC,He said on live TV that he was better than Ghostface.

blackladies,3e0y9m,thestillnessinmyeyes,2,Tue Jul 21 16:18:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying I would boycott him, but maybe other people would. Besides, I haven't bought any Bronson stuff because he sounds like a biter. That's one of the oldest rules in hip hop. Don't bite anybody's stuff.  Personally, I loved Bronson's show on Vice, but I can't get into his music like that."

This conversation feels stupider as I get older.   Training a combat sport has helped me find some peace around looking mad/angry/aggressive, in that I've become more comfortable using my body in aggressive ways, so I do less to manage it on a day-to-day basis. I do know though, that this just makes me look more threatning to ignorant people out there who now see me as even more manly (since Black women aren't considered full women).   Still not smiling unless I feel like it though. Never have. It's a powerful tool though.   I was in the Apple Store the other day and they had me waiting for a ridiculous amount of time. I was waiting quietly up front, arms folded, standing, calm face. It was freaking...people...out. I could feel the discomfort and the physical distance people were keeping. Funny thing is I was actually quite happy and playing through some pleasant memories in my head...that was the Apple Store though. The same behavior could likely get me killed elsewhere."

She is white and was like ""Oh no one ever asks me that... do you think they just ask you that because you're black?"" I shrugged since I had never thought of it before. But there's a part of me that still believes they didn't ask her because she was overweight and obviously unathletic ( meanwhile I was a complete string bean, I don't know why anyone thought I could even lift a basketball so maybe she was right)  Other than that, I think I've been pretty lucky in not being treated like I'm scary unless I'm actually angry. The fear people display when I'm angry surprises me every time, but I roll with it.  I did lament my height and would cry about it regularly as a little girl. Every class photo I was standing in the back with the other tall kids, mostly boys, who all grew up to be 6'5+""  football players, one of them professionally. Now as an adult I just play up having long legs to wrap around my boyfriends, and love showing them off in little dresses."

They did mention the time rachel sued the university for discriminating against her for being white, but they said it was a minor issue. No one should be allowed to ""choose"" what race they wanna be, but suing for ""discrimination"" because she was white is a reason against trying to argue that you are Black."
blackladies,3dz2bj,the_undine,14,Mon Jul 20 18:17:02 2015 UTC,"I appreciate what the poster is doing but the specific statistics he/she is using are suspect, and correlation does not equal causation.  The white family adoption stats, the prison stats (many non-violent drug offenders), and the idea posited in the first place that black people won't always be violent as if we ever were...  This and so many originally non-white nations were established by organized psychopathy. Wiping out entire populations of people in order to take control of the land and whatever wealth could be extracted from it. Disregarding any basic tenets about the value of human life.  As for adoption, why not look to stats on the actual ""model minorities"" in African immigrants, who statistically do amazingly well in our society (better than Asians in relation to the size of their population) and excel in professional industry and are raised by black people??  That last to me shows a clear connection to society telling black people they aren't shit vs. being surrounded by culture that affirms your worth."

blackladies,3dz2bj,racist_reddit,4,Tue Jul 21 02:19:55 2015 UTC,"My background is in epidemiology (which makes seeing bs especially frustrating for me), like part of my job is laughing at bad statistics and tearing down studies but, when it comes to racist arguments, I'd rather save those discussions about study data interpretation, research methods etc with other black people.   My point about calling out white people on racism when they present their random TIL facts about black people is that these arguments often begin from a lack of self-reflection, specifically about their own whiteness (which is the problem that should be addressed not just  their 'facts'). Since 'race' isn't a biological construct but a racist one,  making a logical leap from the sociological contexts of racism and race to throwing data at each other often makes for those long-winded, irrational arguments that you see on reddit. You get bad science with bad analyses.   For me, calling out bs is usually in the form of ""Why is this statement relevant, are you unaware of how ignorant it sounds without some sociological context? Making it about 'race' is racist, just like the history of race, whiteness etc."" Even then, I rarely do it now,  because engaging with them is almost self-inflicted racism to me, there will always be one more thing and we don't owe them any explanations for living."
blackladies,3dz2bj,jay520,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:36:57 2015 UTC,"I see. Personally, I would put pointing out the irrationality of their comments in the same category as refuting the lies they make up.  I don't view presenting factual information as something that is owed to them, or a as something that is done just for their sake. I.E. Other black people read the comments when these discussions pop up. Some of them may not have the background necessary to refute what they're reading and may take it as fact if they've never heard anything to the contrary.   Racists bring up these ""facts"" about blacks because it's easy to do and no one ever calls them on it. May as well have your own copy pasta on those occasions."

I used to be one of those people that would want to explain things, but as I got older I realized I was literally convincing people that I deserved to be treated like a human being. It gets demoralizing after a while."
blackladies,3dyga2,wafflebread,17,Mon Jul 20 19:02:34 2015 UTC,"There are vast swaths of White people who have no idea racism is a widespread issue. They have little to no contact with Black people (or often any minorities at all), and if they do they're never close enough to them to get into discussions of race. Their idea of Civil Rights is ""guys in white hoods were mean and the Martin Luther King fixed it"", because that's what they were taught in school (I speak from experience). Their main exposure to POC is through the media, which as everyone knows is great at depicting POC as fellow humans.   White definitions:   Racism: Pointing out race Racists: Dumbass hicks who burn crosses and set dogs on children   Therefore, if you acknowledge race you are racist, which means you are one step away from setting a bunch of dogs on Black kids. Most White people find this horrifying, so they immediately assume they themselves are not racist. Then the only way to hold ""Black people are thugs"" and ""Racism is pointing out someone's race"" in their head is to decide ""Black people are thugs"" is just a fact backed up by evidence and totally not racism, because they believe it and they aren't racist because they would never set dogs on Black kids.  So they think everything is fixed, they're not racist, and Black people who are struggling are probably thugs who brought this on themselves. But now there are all these Black people all over the television yelling and stuff about how bad things are. What are they talking about? Don't they know Martin Luther King fixed racism? Don't they know we have a Black president?!! And any discussion they're watching of the movement is coming mainly mainstream media sources, which is just a great option for that. If you're lucky they read something by Ta-Nehisi Coates once.   So they hear ""Black Lives Matter"" and think it's Black people trying to separate themselves from White people. Which was exactly what Good Black Man Dr. Martin Luther King fought so hard against. Obviously these Black people are super wrong, and do not realize that the way to racial harmony is to bring everyone together and stop being so divisive. All lives matter, gosh!  In summary, there is a whole lot of ignorance and fear and pigheadedness. A whole lot of unwillingness to examine deeper issues. I don't know if it's so much a denial of Black humanity (though of course there are White people who believe that) as it is a deep terror of confronting serious ugliness within themselves and larger society. When you're White, coming to grips with White supremacy means coming to grips with the idea that you've been profiting off the pain of millions your whole life. Way easier to blame the victim and play the martyr.  For what it's worth, I am starting to see changes among fellow White people. People who are seeing all the anger and the sadness and are starting to think about where it's really coming from. Not en masse, not always huge changes, but people who I would never have expected to change are saying shit I would never have expected them to say, and it's happening independent of any intervention or lecture or anything. Hell if I know how to get that implemented on a large level though.  :/"
blackladies,3dyga2,kitcat_kittycat,19,Tue Jul 21 03:00:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, all of the people responding ""I didn't realize the 'too' was implicit at the end of blacklivesmatter! You've changed my mind, I see the light!"" Like, really? Did you not take 14 seconds out of your day to think about it, and read a little bit, and figure it out yourself?? You had to have someone write a literal paragraphs-long response laying it all out for you in very basic detail before you were willing to think hard enough to place it within its oh-so-obvious historical and societal context without coming up with a snarky response? I mean, all these people actually thought black people collectively got together and started pronouncing that white lives don't matter? Is that really what they all fucking took from this?  I mean, props to them I guess for being willing to change their mind. But it shouldn't take months and months for them to just sit down, listen to someone, and fucking think about it for 2 seconds. Fuck."

Someone actually said that that was how the phrase (BLM) was most often used.  But here's the thing. People tend to see what others do in terms of what they think. So they're figuring if they had been the one to start #whitelivesmatter, the implicit (and everyone else's doesn't) would be the invisible addendum.  That's why I always find the ""But why can you be proud to be Black but if I was proud to be white I'd be racist?!"" argument hilarious. Weeeeee never call them racist for being happy to be white, but whenever THEY express pride in their whiteness, it's always immediately followed up with racist rhetoric. Like bruh. Y'all keep putting yourselves in the racism box, that is NOT our fault."

Also, I'm not sure if the user who posted this was black or not, but to me this seems like another one of those cases where black people on reddit have been trying to explain this for months and months and it's only just now being received.

I wonder how it must feel to live in a world where I don't have to give two shits about someone who doesn't have the same color as me. Just sparing them a second thought of analysis, just one click on an article, just one more second of consideration. Just freaking listening without the snarky come backs or the ""buts"" or the ""what about this?"" and always, the ""what about me?""...

She was talking about the word 'respect' and how if you break it down, you get 'look again'. As in, don't judge me by what you first see, look again and see there is more to me.  That's quite a simple explanation for this behavior. They do not see us as worthy of re-spect (a second look), and therefore only their first impressions and interpretations mean anything, regardless of our own explanations, definitions, and experiences.."

blackladies,3dyga2,Protanope,26,Tue Jul 21 03:39:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for pointing it out. I don't read bestof. Two things come to mind.   I think it's really sad that most people don't realize the issue of alllivesmatter on their own. It's such a basic concept that when people are saying #blacklivesmatter, they're not saying ""black lives matter more than anyone else"", yet so many damn people confuse this as so. It's so outright racist in its idea, yet seems to be the fucking norm. It makes me so tired that Reddit and the internet in general has turned social activism and defending equality into something to shame other people over. You try to bring up a point or call someone out for their bigoted words and all they have to do is throw out ""SJW!"" and it's done. Once they've branded you, there's no more intellectual discussion to be had. I even had a conversation with a friend recently (late 20s, female, Filipino middle school teacher) who told me that she thinks there are way too many SJWs online and that people need to chill out. It just depressed the shit out of me."
blackladies,3dyga2,eroverton,21,Mon Jul 20 17:59:45 2015 UTC,"I pointed it out in the thread, but it's basically a matter of white narcissism. Any statement people make gets warped in the brain so that it puts them in the center of the matter.  Us: ""Black lives matter!""  Them: ""How dare you stand there saying I hate Black people!? I personally have never owned slaves!"""
blackladies,3dyga2,garnetsquarefro,17,Mon Jul 20 18:17:19 2015 UTC,Us: Black Lives Matter  Them: Why are you hating on white people by not including us??? Don't we matter too??    Us: The point is that we're not included.  Them: ALL LIVES DO MATTER you blacks are just making shit up and being racist by taking about racism again! Making it all about you! It offends me to my core that you say white lives don't matter!!  Us: That's not what...  Them: ALL LIVES MATTER!!  And that applies to so much that we try to say about ourselves.

Why don't you do that and save us the confusion?!"" I said:   Because I shouldn't have to make my life an addendum to yours in order to make a point. Black lives matter. Period. There is NO need to argue against this. There is NO need to add a ""too"" unless you are so wrapped up in narcissism, that life cannot be stated to have meaning unless you are included in the sentence.

I have a white friend that I've tried several time to explain to that BLM was not segregational and he wouldn't hear it. So I just stopped talking to him because all he does is obfuscate the matter at hand and make all parties confused regarding race relations. I see a lot of that going on in that thread and it's the reason why I gave up trying to explain because there's an obvious unwillingness to learn.   Kudos to the person for having to make the matter at hand oversimplified so that people understand. It isn't a hard concept at all to lean and if you have to keep oversimplifying an already basic concept, then it says more about them than it does about you. You aren't up your own ass, that's probably their embarrassment talking for being so inept."

blackladies,3dx3sg,RhombusBlue,0,Mon Jul 20 13:17:32 2015 UTC,"This was a really interesting read. I know a number of Latinxs who do speak up about the issue of police killing latinxs and blacks, but I also know quite a few latinx police officers or people with officers as family members. The officers are generally good people. However, they (and their family members) can be so blind or in denial about police brutality.   I recall reading a comment once on Jezebel about how sometimes the problem lies in the fact that officers think they are good people and as such make just decisions. They are so entrenched in the brotherhood that it is hard to see the bad when they believe that they are doing good deeds. Also, I think this extends to their family members and perhaps friends as well. They believe their loved ones are good and glaze over the large structural problems of having a militarized police force.   Also, I see a lot of posts on my FB from my Latinx friends that say as long as you don't cause trouble you wont get in trouble with the police. In general, I think that there were a lot of kids raised that way. I as a black child was raised that way too. And any personal interactions I had with the police even if I was in the wrong were positive. So I can kind of  see how some people can be in denial if it hasn't happened to them. However, there has been overwhelming evidence to suggest that police brutality is very real from webcams/dashcams.  Please excuse my word vomit lol.   tl;dr - this article raises points that i have seen in my daily life."
blackladies,3dx3sg,iamerica2109,0,Mon Jul 20 20:40:36 2015 UTC,"This was a very thoughtful response. My best friend is latina and from being around her family so much I have also seen that she'd been raised with the same mantra. ""Don't get in trouble and you have nothing to worry about."". It made it a little hard for her to understand why I'm leery of police because she figured as long as I'm not doing anything wrong, I have nothing to worry about. That is until she was exposed to the facts behind #BlackLivesMatter. It allowed her to see a completely different perspective about police brutality in the eyes of a black American. It's easier to see the wrong done by police when the local force is not occupied by your peers."
blackladies,3dx3sg,perritoburrito,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:24:45 2015 UTC,"Ugh! The ""mind-your-own-buisness"" thing was so relatable I literally cringed. It's so true too. Everything is supposed to stay ""in the family"", though I was taught to be wary (not necessarily fearful) of the police because of their ability to meddle in family affairs."
blackladies,3dwyza,RainbowBrittle,17,Mon Jul 20 05:47:21 2015 UTC,"What about the idea that learning who ""your group"" is doesn't have to be attached to race for children? Without denying that they will form biases and prejudices against others based on group, isn't it possible that those lines may be drawn outside of race? Obviously any studies performed on teens/adults now is going to show a racial slant because that's the world they've already been raised in, but maybe that can change as we go on."
blackladies,3dwyza,apostrotastrophe,12,Mon Jul 20 11:14:40 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with this. I read in article in college that said that people instinctively recognize those in their ""in-group"" and those in the ""out-group,"" but specifically noted that the use of race to create  distinction between the ""in-group"" and ""out-group"" was totally socially constructed. The boundary could have just as easily been hair color, shoe size, eye color, etc, but in our society---race was that boundary.   So people are right when they say that people are attracted to ""their own group,"" but are incorrect when they say that it is natural to be attracted to your own racial group. The former is natural and based on biology while the latter is unnatural and based on culture."
blackladies,3dwyza,like_a_bosmer,10,Mon Jul 20 11:22:25 2015 UTC,"To expand on this, I recall reading that one hypothesis for why race would not be an evolved indicator of out-groups is that thousands of years ago most people would go their entire lives without encountering someone of a different race.   It's like thinking that people would evolve to be able to combat tigers, without ever encountering tigers their entire lives (or their parents lives, or grandparents lives, etc.)."
blackladies,3dwyza,RunRunDie,9,Mon Jul 20 13:19:49 2015 UTC,"Good point. I think whenever I see the in-group, out-group argument, my first thought is that doesn't explain why the line is being drawn at race.    And the main  issue I had with that picture is why people are thinking this is so revolutionary. That a black kid and a white kid is hugging? Has society evolved so little where people believ this is rare and a strange sight to be seen. Reddit is obsessed with race in all the worst ways and I feel bad for those people who look at that picture and their first thought is ""Hey, isn't that something?""... Do you not have friends of other races?"
blackladies,3dwyza,Starwhisperer,5,Mon Jul 20 14:21:23 2015 UTC,"Like, millions of multiracial people all over the planet but because the reader cannot imagine ever embracing a person of another race, they assume everyone else has the same shitty walls up that they do."
blackladies,3dwyza,thestillnessinmyeyes,7,Mon Jul 20 15:35:40 2015 UTC,"I knowww..... it's all bs. All this in group and out group nonsense is used for people to feel better and justified for having prejudiced thoughts and behaviors. Go to any minority and see if this ""phenomena"" affects them.    Just because you're content with being shitty, don't smear that on me too."

blackladies,3dwyza,Mangalaiii,2,Mon Jul 20 20:16:23 2015 UTC,I never thought of it that way. This is a really good point.
blackladies,3dwyza,like_a_bosmer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:17:31 2015 UTC,"Is this why I can immediately recognize other people from the country my family is from vs other black people. Even if they haven't spoken or told me anything about themselves? Or why people can identify Americans vs other people whenever Americans travel?  Its like something subtle in the way people walk or dress or hold themselves. It kind of freaks me out, but its kinda cool."
blackladies,3dwyza,zimtkuss,5,Mon Jul 20 20:42:48 2015 UTC,"Here's the study I am talking about. It didn't use race, it used groups of children wearing red and blue shirts, and found that the kids, simply from being identified by their color shirts, started to form more favorable opinions of children of their own shirt color. It got worse when the accomplishments of one group were singled out by the teachers. They didn't have to say, ""Red shirts are bad,"" to have this effect; all they had to do was say ""The blue shirts scored highest on the test.""   So it doesn't have to be because of race. The idea behind implicit/unconscious/subconscious racism is that your brain is collating and noticing racial differences and coming to conclusions without any conscious effort at all. But, it does have to be something that is identified, and race is always identified, even when it is not overtly judged. A few people deciding that they are not going to notice it doesn't matter. The apparent racial differences in the larger society (economic, opportunity, media portrayal, etc) will make it impossible to remain unaffected by it."
blackladies,3dwyza,RhombusBlue,7,Mon Jul 20 17:32:12 2015 UTC,"I think they believe the results, they just don't like them because it requires them to question their own awesomeness and the awesomeness of their children.  I have this guy friend...we clicked instantly when we first me (as friends)...loved him to death. Then I saw he had a MASSIVE ""colorblind"" tattoo and I was instantly suspect. A few years later and I've come to see that I was right. He's not anti-racism, he's just anti-considering his own potential for negative thought and behavior. As I watch him, he's the first one to jump to the defense of White males (usually awful ones) and loves memes like that.   When I was on Facebook, I'd generally call out the problem with images of that breed, but the people who share them are HELL BENT on believing that they are better than ""those racists over there"" and investing in their own inherent awesomeness. That's why their thoughts are so hard to confront. They're supremacists too, but in complete denial of it.   They might be the Whitest White people out there."
blackladies,3dwyza,acdn,2,Mon Jul 20 13:04:14 2015 UTC,"I think that it's important to reinforce the fact that racial bias is unconscious. The colorblind person may not be racist in their conscious thoughts, but they are almost guaranteed to have unconscious bias. This unconscious bias was not taught per se, but was conferred via the socialization process.  If the goal is to mitigate the effects of racial discrimination, then simply not teaching people to be consciously racist is insufficient. The socialization process occurs and the unconscious bias is conferred.  However, if someone learns that racial bias is part of socialization, then they can think critically about their socialization process.  If you want to teach that to someone, they have to learn what race is and what racism is.  IMO, its much more effective to teach someone that the U.S. is a multicultural society. We need to teach that different cultures exist. We also need to teach that these cultures are the byproduct of a caste system. It is possible to have different subcultures without the existence of a caste system, but people must be educated and legal protections need to exist."
blackladies,3dwyza,catofnortherndarknes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:01:18 2015 UTC,"Interesting...when we learn about slavery/Jim Crow laws/Civil Rights movement, it seems to stop with the passage of the Civil Rights Act, as if that made everything perfect...and as if the racism that hindered the economic development of blacks only ever existed in the south, so everyone in the northern states must have had it good all along.  The dots aren't connected through education, and that leaves people to connect them on their own, without the knowledge to do so correctly. And they don't even realize that they are doing it, and therefore can't even begin to question it."

Your willingness/ability to assimilate your speech patterns into a manner found more acceptable to the majority culture does not reflect on your intelligence level, only the degree to which you have been trained. Every single one of those tweets sounds like reinforcing racist stereotypes - 'Black people (like me) who speak standard English are an anomaly and shunned by others due to the anti-intellectualism of the Black community because everyone knows Negroes don't read or comprehend grammar' blah blah blah bullshit.  I recently worked with a group of teenagers for a day. Each of them were so desperate to prove they weren't the ""average"" Negro, I wanted to laugh so badly, but it was kinda sad as well.

When it was growing, it would grow in perfect teeny springy coils so that I was obsessed with it as much as my friends. So, yeah, I didn't mind when people would touch it and use it as a spring because I thought it was super cool myself. Now, these were only my friends. Strangers never come up to me and touch my hair, ever. That's just weird and it's surprising that people would think that's okay."

I've never liked people touching my hair unless they're the one doing my hair. I've never really liked being touched at all unless it's intimately and with someone I trust. People get offended but I've learned not to give a shit. My personal comfort trumps your curiosity. Don't touch my damn hair. It's especially bad with strangers because I have locks :/  I cussed a lady out at Costco for walking up to my son while he was in the cart and straight up putting her dusty ass hands in my son's hair. She had the nerve to look at me and remark that it was ""so soft"". My sister had to prevent me from breaking her wrists on the spot. I was absolutely furious. I don't understand what gives anyone the idea that they have unrestricted permission to just touch people. It's gross."

I used to put up with it but now that i'm older i'm kinda like ""we're all adults here why are you touching my hair?"" In the end it's all about they way people touch it for me. Like if you give one of my curls a nice soft tug to see it spring back into it's nice little spiral, we are cool. But the assholes who like to take a fistful of curls and get their hands tangled up in there are my worst enemies, and usually the majority of the offenders. Also, I did not appreciate people feeling around my scalp for tracks before cutting my hair when it would be straight.   Generally my rules are: -Ask first if you haven't been given permission already (i do enjoy scalp massages) - Do not take a fistful -Try not to touch it when it's straight because your (and my own) finger oils are gonna fuck it up -Do not yank it to the point that i feel that your ripping it out of my scalp"

blackladies,3dubks,Starwhisperer,10,Sun Jul 19 21:09:54 2015 UTC,"Sweet!! I love this idea.   Just Mom and Me  When I was very young, my mom rented a house that we both lived in. It wasn't in the best neighborhood, but it was home for a time. I never felt uncomfortable living there until one night when something weird occurred.   At that time, I used to sleep in my mom's bed a lot. I was scared of the dark and hated being by myself at night. It just so happened that one night I was sleeping in my mom's bed and I woke up. I am not sure why I did, but my body just seemed to sense something and I was awake. It must have been late because I couldn't hear anything else in the house or outside. My mom was still asleep beside me.   Anyway, for some reason my eyes focused on my mom's bedroom door. The door was closed, but the hallway light was on since I could see the light coming through the space between the door and the carpet.  That wasn't unusual since we would sometimes sleep with the hallway light on. I assumed she left it on.    I was staring at the door when suddenly, the door handle turned and the door slowly opened on its own. There was no one on the other side of the door though. No one else was in the house since it was just my mom and I. When I realized the door opened on its own, I ducked under the covers and huddled next to my mom who was sound asleep. I never woke her up. I just remember being scared and trying to fall asleep. I don't know how long it took me, but eventually, I did fall asleep. To this day, I don't know how to explain what I saw, but I know what I saw.   Black Mass  A couple years after the above story, my mom and I, along with some other relatives, moved into another house. Unlike the previous house, I never liked this house from the start. Strangely enough, it was in a much nicer neighborhood, but I never liked being alone in it. Nor did I like the feeling of it. It just had a creepy vibe. There isn't any one story in particular that stands out, I just had a bunch of weird experiences in this house. I will focus on two in particular.   In one incident, I arrived home after school and was home by myself. Since I hated being alone in that house, I would always stay on the 1st floor (in case I needed to make a quick escape). Anyway, I was sitting on the couch when I heard a weird rumble coming from the kitchen. I went in the kitchen to figure out what was going on . When I entered, there was a black mass covering the window that appeared to be moving. I realized that the window was covered entirely in black house flies. I think there may have been 150 or 200 or maybe even 250 of them. They definitely weren't there when I left for school in the morning. They were all buzzing trying to get past the window. That was the rumble I heard. I tried to kill as many as I could. However, I left the job half-finished. I was unsettled by the whole thing. That many flies gathered together in one place reminded me of death.  I went outside and waited until a relative arrived home before stepping foot in the house again.   Home Alone  In another incident at this same house, I arrived home to an empty house after school. Per my own routine, I stayed downstairs by the door. I decided to watch television just to get my mind off the fact that I was home by myself (again). Things were okay until I heard a heavy thump above which seemed to be coming from my mother's room. Curious, I went upstairs and found nothing amiss. I went back downstairs and started watching t.v. again.   I suddenly heard footsteps. Heavy footsteps. I could make out how they walked across the room and then stopped.  This time, I was frozen with fear. I had just been upstairs and found no one there. I thought that maybe I was imagining things and calmed myself down a bit. I thought that maybe creaky floorboards were to blame. I had calmed down a bit until the footsteps started up again from where they stopped and continued to the other side of the room and then stopped.  After that, I knew that I had heard footsteps. Someone or something was in the house with me. I went to the kitchen to grab the biggest knife I could. I debated going upstairs...but was too afraid to do so. It was getting dark (it was winter and we had early sunsets) and I didn't want to go outside. I turned the t.v. off and sat on the couch.   The footsteps started up again, this time uninterrupted, from one side of the room to the other. That was it. I grabbed the home phone and stood by the door and called my mom, my uncle, my grandma--really anyone to come here and stay with me. I was hysterical. I just had no idea what was going on upstairs.   Eventually, my uncle and grandma came home. My uncle checked my mom's room and found no one. I was adamant that something was upstairs at that time.   I am not the only one to have had weird experiences. A bunch of other relatives have heard weird noises and voices in the house and think that the place is haunted. Thankfully, we don't live there anymore, but we rent the house out to others. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"

My back was not touching the wall. I do not believe in ghosts, I'm not religious in the least, but I don't know what the fuck happened there. I'm sure there could be some mental/physical stuff going on, but I have yet to hear a believable explanation."

blackladies,3dubks,Mur-cie-lago,5,Sun Jul 19 17:36:06 2015 UTC,"That dream is spooky, but also kind of sweet...  One year ago I was over a friend's parents' house in Portland. Everyone there was in the living room..or so I thought.  I went to the bathroom, and saw a dark figure looking at me from a slightly opened door leading to my friend's parents' bedroom. My friend has a younger brother who lives there but I hadn't seen him that day. I say, ""Hello?"" to the figure, because I'm kind of weirded out he would be hiding like that. The figure says nothing. Instead, the door just slowly closes shut.   I go back to the living room, creeped out. I ask my friend if his brother is in the house. He says no, he's out of town on a road trip. WTF!  Another time when I was 9, I was in the lobby of a nursing home waiting for my grandma to return from visiting a friend. I'm sitting in this area that just has a big cage filed with tiny birds.   I hear someone behind me whisper, ""Give me your money."" I freak out and hide under a chair. I never saw anyone walking around who could have said that."

blackladies,3dubks,I_want_wine,6,Mon Jul 20 19:37:56 2015 UTC,"I've told a story similar to this one before in a reddit thread.  When I was 14, my family moved into my great aunt's old house in the West End. Nobody had lived in it for 4 years and my aunt was to elderly to keep it up herself. The house was very old and kind of dilapidated. It was a 2 bedroom house with an attic that my sister used as her bedroom and an unused basement that nobody ever went into. My parents had their own bedroom and I was excited to finally have my own after having shared with my sister for 14 years. My bedroom was actually a repurposed den that connected to the kitchen and the hallway and had a window that looked out over the deck in the backyard. The unused basement connected to a door that was right next to my bedroom door in the hallway.  There were times at night where I would hear scratching outside on the deck and at my window. I wrote this off as possums, squirrels, and birds messing around on the deck even though I didn't hear any animal noises.   But there was one night when I had left my window slightly open to get cool air. I heard the same scratching noises as before, but this time it was a little different. Like any messy teenager, I had left a pile of clothes and other thin gs on the floor near my window. I heard the strange noises and turned around. There was a person at my window using a stick to try to steal clothes from my room.  I thought I was having night terrors again. Even if I didn't think that, I was too afraid to move. I gathered the courage to turn on the desk lamp near my bed, and the person dropped the stick and ran away. I went back to sleep. The scratching noises would still happen every now and then and I didn't tell anyone about this incident (stupid on my part).  I thought it was a ghost for a long time, but when we moved, we finally went down into the basement and found a sleeping bag, lantern and a few water bottles. We also found a pair of jeans that I thought I had lost on the deck.  Someone had been living in our house without us knowing for the three years that we stayed there."

blackladies,3dubks,thestillnessinmyeyes,4,Mon Jul 20 16:57:12 2015 UTC,"My grandmother was a great woman, but had a habit of nagging. She did it to my father and she did it to me. It came from a place of love, but she was a nagger. My grandmother passed away from cancer 8 years ago, four days after my birthday.  I had went out for some Indian food that I wolfed-down and came down with the  ""-itis"". I had left-overs, but I was too lazy to get up to put it in the fridge. I fell asleep on my grandmother's couches that are in my basement. As I slept, I heard ""You better that food away before you go and try to eat that! You're gonna get sick!"" in my grandmother's voice. In that same nagging tone.  When my grandmother was succumbing to her cancer, she stayed at our house. The doctors said that there was nothing else to be done, but to make her comfortable. A little over a week before her death, my grandmother nearly jumped out of her bed in fear. My dad had to help her back into the bed and calm her down. He asked her what was wrong. She frantically said she saw someone she knew, a good friend. I can't remember the name, but it was a man who had been dead for over a decade. Over the next few days, she would have conversations with relatives and close friends who have been dead for years. She spoke to her mom, a lot. I always heard her say, ""I know, Ma!"" or ""Okay, okay, Ma!"" I eavesdropped into her side of the conversations to these people, all the time. Most times, I was unable to make out the topics, but on those rare occasions when I could make them out, it was about catching up on lost time. I used to walk in to the room and ask who was she talking to. She would reply, ""Oh, nobody."" My presence always messed everything up and the conversations went dormant until I was out of the room and they all knew I wouldn't be back. This was my great grandmother, great aunts and great uncles. They didn't want to speak to me. :( It's said that people who are near death are visited by their most cherished loved ones before passing. Maybe it's to ease the fear of dying.  There's an old superstition that says if a bird is desperately trying to get into a window of your home, a close loved one will die. One night, at my grandfather's house (the childhood home of my mom, my aunts and uncle) there was a finch that tried to get in through the window. It was a colorful bird, a finch, and differed from the usual grey pigeon or brown sparrow of the city. It tried so hard to get into the house and wasn't bothered by the large gathering of people watching it. My cousin walked out of the house to the window to shoo it away and it didn't go easily. A few days later, my mom got a call that my aunt passed away."

blackladies,3dubks,like_a_bosmer,2,Tue Jul 21 03:16:38 2015 UTC,"Posted this to blackfellas a while ago but it's my only big one so here goes...  So, sporadically throughout my childhood I always heard this... sound. No one else could ever hear it but it would keep me awake at night for being so loud. It was always a night, usually during the warmer months and always gave me the very distinct sensation of something like a neighborhood or city sized craft hovering just half a mile or so above ground. Just a LOUD, low frequency, electrical/ mechanical sounding hum like a massive engine idling. The sound always filled me with dread. As I got older I just dismissed this as something like a phantom ringing in my ears. But once I heard it, there was no going back to sleep, it was just too loud. Not loud like someone or something loud next to you but more like a waterfall or jet engine loud, the kind of loud that engulfs and mutes all other sound.   I began having nightmares about greys. I've never actually believed in ghosts or anything like that, in fact I've always enjoyed ghost stories with the calm, detached security of none of it being really, just very fascinating fictions. But this I couldn't shake. So one night I'm having a nightmare about greys while my partner is sleeping over. In the dream, I wake in the dark, my partner is gone, and there is a grey standing over me from the corner of the king sized bed (so it's large) as I am on the other side of the bed, directly beneath the window. As I start to scream, the grey covers my mouth and my nose and I can't make any sound. This is particularly terrifying because I've always had the ability to scream like a ventriloquist, as in, very loudly without opening my mouth, meaning that the grey is somehow suppressing not my ability to scream but my ability to make sound at all.   Eventually I wake up. And I see the grey is still standing in the corner. Just standing there. About 6ft tall, and everything you expect a grey to be, though not stick thin and fragile looking but full bodied and maybe lightly furred, less sickly grey, more blue/ lavender grey. (I suspect this description may have entered my psyche from a Madeline L'engle book.)  Heavy dread fills me again and I close my eyes, waking up again a bit later. When I wake up, I hear the hum. I stay awake for the rest of the night.   When I talk to my partner about it, this is where it got a little creepy. My partner explains that I didn't dream him not being in the bed, he really did get up to go use the bathroom. He woke up to a feeling of dread and tried to shake it off. He was also an atheist and skeptic, so it's not like either of us are easily spooked or given to superstition. As I recount what happened to me, he becomes very agitated and unsettled and asks me not to talk about it anymore. We just stay up for the rest of the early morning, neither being able to sleep again.   A couple of years later I am recalling this story to my current partner. When I mention the hum he interjects ""Oh yeah! I heard a podcast about that! People report it all over the world!"" I started crying like a bitch, sobbing. For years, years and years, I thought I was crazy. I thought I was hearing things. I so rarely told anyone about it because I thought it was all in my head, I was flooded with the instant relief of knowing either there was actually a phenomenon causing the sound or there was an illness from which several people were suffering.   There is still no answer for ""the hum."" But it's real. A lot of reports claim that it drives some people crazy, drives them to kill themselves or harm others. I've never experienced such and inclination. I have a theory that the sensation of dread is physiological rather than psychological, that the frequency causes that off feeling, the same way seismic waves make some people nauseated.   http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1184592/Have-heard-The-Hum-The-throbbing-noise-just-wont-away.html"

blackladies,3dubks,I_want_wine,2,Mon Jul 20 20:58:53 2015 UTC,"I have a story a lot like yours!  I think my grandfather sometimes contacts me through dreams. He died in 2009. I KNOW I SOUND CRAZY but I believe it to be true. It's only happened twice, and only at very important moments.   The first time was probably a month or so after he died. It seemed so real. In the dream, I woke up in my bedroom, got up like normal and walked to the living room, where I saw my grandfather sitting in the chair he would always sit in. I said ""hey, granddaddy! How are you doing?"" almost like it wasn't weird that he was there. He smiled and excitedly told me ""it's amazing!!! I can do whatever I want, ..... (there was some more detail in there I'm forgetting, it's been years) and I can smoke all the cigarrettes I want!!"" I remember telling him I loved him. And then I woke up. The next day I was riding in the car with my mom (his daughter) and told her that I had a dream with granddaddy. I told her that he was very happy and told her what he said about the cigarettes and mentioned that it was weird he even mentioned cigarettes because I'd never known him to be a smoker. She then started crying and said that he was a huge chain smoker back in the day (before I was born) and gave it up. She said she'd been missing him so hard and was crying about it that night, and she thought he was trying to pass along the message that he was ok to her through me.  Fast forward to over a year and a half ago, just before I had my baby (my first) and he came to me again. It was similar to the last in that it started out in a very familiar setting: a family reunion. I was talking to uncles and someone kept touching my shoulder. I ignored it until I got fully annoyed (so probably after the 2nd time LOL) and then I turned around and it was him smiling. I said ""granddaddy! "" in shock because this time it was like I knew he wasn't supposed to be there. He said something like ""I heard about the baby! I just wanted to tell you that she is so beautiful and that is such a beautiful thing."" I told him I love him and then I woke up.   ETA: Now I'm crying. I really miss my granddaddy. I always had/have such a special relationship with my grandparents."

blackladies,3dubks,AliceHouse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:10:43 2015 UTC,"Sadly, most of my experience with the paranormal comes more from books than real life. One time hanging with a friend in a graveyard I saw a UFO pulling some tricks in the sky. When I went to point at it though, I accidentally poked my friend in the eyeball. But if there are ghosts, I'm fairly certain I'm ghost proof.

Check out /r/teachers for candid and supportive teacher discussion. It's like the bar down the block from your school where all the real conversations about teaching happen. It's a good sub to ask your question.  /r/education is a bit of a battleground sub between politically conservative ""education reformers"" and teachers themselves (those two groups are pretty much mutually exclusive), and the content is often more about education as an institution than teaching itself.  /r/teachingresources sometimes has some good tools and links.  Then there are more specific subs like /r/elateachers and /r/scienceteachers.  Good luck starting your first year!

blackladies,3dsma9,BitchCallMeGoku,7,Sun Jul 19 01:43:51 2015 UTC,Finally my time to shine 😊  I went fully natural in 2010 (big chop) and have found it infinitely easier to manage my hair while its natural. I mostly keep it up in 2 strand flat twists because I run about 20mi/week plus weightlifting 5 days. I've been doing consistent exercise since probably late 2012 and in terms of the transition itself I would try braiding your hair down or two strand twist updos...maybe a weave or crochet braids? Idk how long is your hair?
blackladies,3dsma9,petitoignon,5,Sun Jul 19 13:50:48 2015 UTC,"Both have their positives and negatives. When I transitioned, I always did twist outs and braid outs, so working out pretty much ruined those, forcing me to brain my hair each night, which was fine at the time. Because of this, I decided to workout after my day.   If you're wearing your natural curl pattern, I'd say it's easier to have natural hair because sweat really won't do much to your natural curl pattern, but if you were it stretched and sweat a lot during workouts, your hair may get ruined.   As far weaning a relaxer, I'd look at the possibilities of natural hair. I'd read tons of blogs, watch MahoganyCurls and Naptural85 videos on YouTube with excitement for the day my hair got to that length. Find ways to get excited about your hair, engage in positive self talk about your hair."
blackladies,3dsma9,TigerGradKC,5,Sun Jul 19 05:28:57 2015 UTC,"It's definitely MUCH easier to maintain natural hair when you're working out that much since you can wash it more often without drying it out like relaxed hair would. I transitioned for about 6 months (cutting off some relaxed hair a little at a time) before I got sick of the two textures and cut the rest off. I've just been wearing Senegalese twists, crochet braids or wigs to change things up while my natural hair grows out. Wigs these days are a lot more natural looking than they used to be. I also wore braids and curlier hair styles (to get myself into the mindset of not having straight hair anymore)  while I was transitioning to try and wean myself off of relaxers."
blackladies,3dsma9,BeirutJH,8,Sun Jul 19 06:51:36 2015 UTC,"Natural hair. Much, much easier for me, at least. I am 1.5 years out so my hair is fairly large. I'm am also lazy with it and really only do wash and gos. I can say that my hair is hot as hell when I work out (if I don't wear it up, it's just awful), but at least I am not sweating it out like I would when my hair was relaxed. There was just not point to even trying with relaxed hair.  I just cut my hair off and wore a cute wig for the first 4-6 months while my hair grew out into something that didn't make me look like Prince. I get compliments all of the time now which I never thought I would. I never thought I could be beautiful with natural hair. Sometimes I still feel self conscious, but I know that is crazy. Cutting my hair and growing it out was one of the best decisions I've made for myself."

For whatever reason, I thought people were more socially progressive in France, but I'm not really sure why I thought that.   Anyway, I can relate. I grew up in Kentucky and dealt with this stuff on the regular. Then, I moved to California, and honestly it was much different. White people there never say blatantly offensive things to my face (but I'm sure things are different when I'm not around).   But now I'm at Harvard doing research, and it's like I'm being reminded of how thoughtlessly offensive some white people can be. Most of my suite mates are white, and I've stopped going out with them and their (white) guy friends because every time somebody says something ignorant. And once I told a couple of my suite mates something racist another girl said to me, and they just looked at me like ""Why do you have to bring up race stuff?""   So yeah. Racism definitely exists in CA (after a lifetime of living in Kentucky, it wasn't until I moved to CA that someone yelled the n-word at me), but at least it isn't this constant day-to-day thing where people say dumb crap and expect me to take it."

I too stick to fiction mostly romance because....well it's not like I'm getting any in real life. That being said if you don't mind interracial reads I have a few suggestions (and all the heroines are black):  Wheels of Steel Trilogy by Pepper Pace - amazing story about a woman and a man with cerebral palsy (I think) coming together. Both main characters are college age and let me tell you it doesn't get boring.  The Masseusse and The Dragon by Violette Dubrinsky. The leading man is half-Korean half-Egyptian and is part of the Korean mob. Once again drama ensues and the plot is pretty well thought out.  The Battaglia series by Sienna Mynx. Italian male/ Black female/ Asian male. This deals with the Sicilian mafia and has some of the most jaw dropping sex scenes I've read in the life. The plot is pretty solid and as a writer Sienna always manages to leave you wanting more.  All the books make reference to race relations - wheels of steel also speaks of relationships among members with disability obviously. Hope you check them out.

I thought they were growing some balls now, sadly I was wrong. Most of the ""non-supportive"" comments in the /r/blackladies thread seems to come from outsiders at first glance. SRD has had a lot of traffic in the past weeks due to the metadrama in the past week. Your thread for example was ""hit"" with the fall-out from the livethread we did on the Purge, and where everyone was incredibly disappointed by the lack of action (yet again) too.   Personally I still have no clue what possible motivation reddit admins might have to allow those hate subreddits to exist."

Long ago, SRD used to actually care when SRSSucks called us ""SRS lite"" or whatever, for some reason. But luckily, we had crazy fucking Laurelai (and RobotAnna) to point our fingers at and go ""see?! We're not SJWs! We don't like those guys either!"".  But then those two users faded away, so we scrambled for more once the SRS lite ""accusations"" started increasing again. Whether or not they were shitty people, we just needed someone to throw under the bus. We tried Jess_Than_Three, we tried Greenduch, ultimately the sub seemed to be comfortable shitting on TheIdesOfLight (and this sub as an extension). Why? I dunno, probably cause an outspoken black woman on the internet of all places is already an irritant to most shitty (racist) people, and most people are still shitty (and racist) today. Even in SRD.   I was completely baffled by all the ""Ides is crazy"" stuff I was seeing, as I never got why that was. I felt like I was being propogandized to so I started hanging out around blackladies to see if I was (I was).  SRD seemed to have calmed down recently about Ides, especially when she got this newest handle and the sub stopped caring about SJW accusations cause they realized that was a silly thing to worry about. I'm happy about that, but some people in SRD still seem to cling on to this ""Ides/blackladies is crazy/scary/mean"" shit for some reason."

Sorry for not being a black lady :P but I needed to fill my front page with more racial honesty and less of that bullshit that mainstream reddit is producing. Keep on keepin' on blackladies!"
blackladies,3dop1n,rival13,9,Sat Jul 18 02:56:40 2015 UTC,This. This so much.
blackladies,3dop1n,blu3dice,13,Sat Jul 18 09:50:51 2015 UTC,"Theres nothing I say/do on reddit that requires privacy. My thoughts and feelings are my own. Uncle Skeeter and friends can just get used to the idea of my blackness in their oasis. We're a civil, diverse group of women (some men) of all races and we dont have to hide."
blackladies,3dop1n,IrbyTremor,17,Sat Jul 18 06:36:31 2015 UTC,"Let em snitch and let em visit, i say  That said alternatives or private spaces are being discussed"
blackladies,3dop1n,RunRunDie,4,Sat Jul 18 00:21:26 2015 UTC,"They can snitch and none of us will curr. It's the lurking that is dangerous. All supposed e-skin ain't kin. Have to be careful of pretenders who will do nothing but subtly impede, cause in-fighting, and derail. Can't be welcoming when trying to focus."
blackladies,3dop1n,supcaci,19,Sat Jul 18 00:26:24 2015 UTC,"I'm neither black nor a lady, and I came here after it was linked from SRD. I'm trying to find subs that will expose me to viewpoints I might not normally encounter (eg. this one) or subs about topics that I think I might have some misconceptions (eg. /r/libertarianism). I think this will keep me safe from thinking reddit represents the world when it is largely just a collection of echo chambers. That being said, I don't want to take away your safe space if my presence alone will do that. So LMK (seriously) and I'll unsub and go to different places."
blackladies,3dop1n,RunRunDie,21,Sat Jul 18 00:59:10 2015 UTC,It's totally cool to lurk and learn if you are well-intentioned.
blackladies,3dop1n,catofnortherndarknes,5,Sat Jul 18 01:16:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I don't harbour ill will toward anyone, and I want to see if there are things I can learn or misconceptions I need to unlearn."
blackladies,3dop1n,RunRunDie,4,Sat Jul 18 05:49:48 2015 UTC,"Since you're asking, I would describe my attitude as indifferent, as long as you (or others) understand that while the byproduct of our conversations with each other may be that you learn some things you find useful or are provided with food for thought, that is not why we're here."
blackladies,3dop1n,fsmpastafarian,3,Sat Jul 18 22:01:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, I appreciate the distinction."
blackladies,3dop1n,RunRunDie,2,Sun Jul 19 02:10:34 2015 UTC,"No worries, there are plenty of non-black, non-female regulars here who are totally welcome. Some people are a little more protective since the recent events, but on the whole, most people here are pretty stoked to have non-black ladies here, provided they're respectful and well-intentioned. Please stay!"
blackladies,3dop1n,theworldisbullshit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:41:26 2015 UTC,Thanks
blackladies,3dop1n,Mur-cie-lago,-21,Sun Jul 19 02:09:15 2015 UTC,Please don't come here. For the love of god please go back to srd.
blackladies,3dop1n,Starwhisperer,36,Sat Jul 18 01:00:13 2015 UTC,"Chill out with ""please don't come here"". We want people to actually learn about the bullshit we are struggling through to be heard."
blackladies,3dop1n,theworldisbullshit,22,Sat Jul 18 02:04:37 2015 UTC,"... why can't he come here? Wtf?    Anyway, you're welcome here. While the posts at the moment have to do with the drama surrounding Reddit, it's not always like this. I'm sure you'll find something to take away from this place as the posts are usually refreshing and different."
blackladies,3dop1n,Starwhisperer,-11,Sat Jul 18 01:02:44 2015 UTC,"What does he add to this sub? Oh yea, nothing."
blackladies,3dop1n,theworldisbullshit,11,Sat Jul 18 01:05:32 2015 UTC,Um... Why can't he add anything to the sub?
blackladies,3dop1n,Starwhisperer,-6,Sat Jul 18 01:07:49 2015 UTC,He isn't black..Thiis is a sub called blackladies. He said he is neither black nor a woman so what does he add?
blackladies,3dop1n,catofnortherndarknes,18,Sat Jul 18 01:10:52 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to find subs that will expose me to viewpoints I might not normally encounter (eg. this one)   As long as he's aware, has read the sidebar and will appropriately engage with the subreddit because he genuinely wants to learn something and be exposed to concepts he's not normally exposed to, then yes, I don't understand how there's an issue. BlackLadies has people who post and who subscribe who are not black and who are not ladies."
blackladies,3dop1n,supcaci,5,Sat Jul 18 01:17:37 2015 UTC,"wants to learn something   This is the only part that makes me nervous.  I for one am not here to teach anyone or learn from anyone but other Black folk.  Possibly other ""woke"" people of color for the purposes of solidarity."
blackladies,3dop1n,Honeychile6841,17,Sat Jul 18 18:52:56 2015 UTC,"There are lots of allies all colors and genders here, and that's totally fine. We primarily have the floor, but it's totally cool for people to lurk and learn and participate in good faith."
blackladies,3dop1n,theworldisbullshit,2,Sat Jul 18 01:17:52 2015 UTC,Agreed.?
blackladies,3dop1n,racist_reddit,-6,Sat Jul 18 15:33:09 2015 UTC,Allies? lmao.
blackladies,3dop1n,catofnortherndarknes,3,Sat Jul 18 01:19:46 2015 UTC,Uh oh angry whites are downvotig you lmao. This is one reason why I don't like them here either. Anytime you don't suck their dick they downvote. Either them or the white loving black folk smh.
blackladies,3dop1n,orca_death_grill,6,Sat Jul 18 03:00:14 2015 UTC,Who was the originator of this thread?  Who'd we lose?
blackladies,3dop1n,pro_creator,4,Sat Jul 18 06:00:01 2015 UTC,"I'm still here. Had to delete for a very specific reason: sent some professionals over here to take a look and do what they will. They don't need to know all of my business, though. :P"
blackladies,3dop1n,catofnortherndarknes,3,Sat Jul 18 23:57:14 2015 UTC,Welcome bike! :)
blackladies,3dop1n,RaHxRaH,3,Sun Jul 19 00:05:53 2015 UTC,I'm glad!
blackladies,3dop1n,lottikey,3,Sun Jul 19 00:58:44 2015 UTC,"yeah, that's who it was."
blackladies,3dop1n,catofnortherndarknes,5,Sat Jul 18 06:11:00 2015 UTC,I liked her.  :(
blackladies,3dop1n,RaHxRaH,3,Sat Jul 18 08:40:31 2015 UTC,"Wow, looks totally gone, too.  Not just from Blackladies.  I wonder what happened?"
blackladies,3dop1n,catofnortherndarknes,6,Sat Jul 18 06:13:29 2015 UTC,"She deleted her account. Maybe she got fed up? It seemed that way, going by her responses in this thread and the other asking why the sub wasn't private."
blackladies,3dop1n,wafflebread,3,Sat Jul 18 06:48:33 2015 UTC,"Ah, I knew that was a possibility, but I was hoping it wasn't the case."
blackladies,3dop1n,exquisitedorks,3,Sat Jul 18 06:53:49 2015 UTC,No!! I loved her comments!!
blackladies,3dop1n,theworldisbullshit,4,Sat Jul 18 14:56:14 2015 UTC,I am a black gender-nonconforming sorta-man who has had a few accounts I ditched for security's sake.
blackladies,3dop1n,Honeychile6841,4,Sat Jul 18 13:57:38 2015 UTC,"Yup. There is no point in even having important discussions here and the mods don't want to make the sub private so you're always going to deal with this, unfortunately So much for a ""safe space"""
blackladies,3dop1n,catofnortherndarknes,10,Sat Jul 18 00:21:21 2015 UTC,"Please stop down voting this user.  She has the right to feel her feelings.  TWIB- I've been their as well.  It's ok.  I know our mods are taking it up the arse for us. This is a safe, positive place. Your feelings are valid."
blackladies,3dop1n,racist_reddit,5,Sat Jul 18 15:41:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Disagree with her, okay, but don't silence her.  Not in here."
blackladies,3dop1n,catofnortherndarknes,6,Sat Jul 18 18:55:34 2015 UTC,This. I wanted to make a post on this topic but I'm unable to make posts.
blackladies,3dop1n,racist_reddit,2,Sat Jul 18 20:16:29 2015 UTC,I'm unable to make posts.   Huh?
blackladies,3dop1n,catofnortherndarknes,2,Sat Jul 18 20:20:51 2015 UTC,I wanted to make a discussion post on this topic but I can't make posts. When I try to submit It just tells me I'm a new user(I'm not) or my posts haven't been doing well( I hardly make posts so Idk how this is true).
blackladies,3dop1n,IrbyTremor,2,Sat Jul 18 20:24:37 2015 UTC,Weird!
blackladies,3dop1n,wisesonAC,2,Sat Jul 18 20:27:26 2015 UTC,"You're not unable to make posts, you're just not using np links. I'm not sure if y'all realize this or not, but as the OP pointed out, we have a lot of ""visitors"" to the sub right now. It would stand to follow that some of the voting patterns that we've come to expect in the sub are skewed, no?"
blackladies,3dop1n,MusaTheRedGuard,12,Sat Jul 18 20:23:45 2015 UTC,"You know about the otherplace, right? PM me"
blackladies,3dp9kg,RaHxRaH,10,Sat Jul 18 03:29:15 2015 UTC,It is one of the few places I can go and feel like a normal person..
blackladies,3dp9kg,wafflebread,9,Sat Jul 18 06:20:27 2015 UTC,I find this sub to be the backbone of black reddit. Before I knew about r/blackfellas or r/blerds I knew of this sub. I'm also pretty sure it's the most popular. The sub helps to remind me that I'm not crazy sometimes.
blackladies,3dp9kg,OriginalKingD,7,Sat Jul 18 19:08:26 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy the camaraderie. I hang out in Black Twitter a lot but if I want a more personal experience, I go here."
blackladies,3dp9kg,Afrodisiac333,8,Sat Jul 18 05:19:36 2015 UTC,"This sub has made me feel better about being myself. I don't have a lot of black people to look up too in my life, so being on here has showed me that being black is okay. As well, has exposed me to many different perspectives and issues going on within the black community."
blackladies,3dp9kg,justswimfree,6,Sat Jul 18 22:04:21 2015 UTC,"Definitely a safe space, I'm introverted as a defense mechanism, I don't have many friends (not on social media) and I online game. I also went to a PWI and it took a dent on my psyche but I'm rebuilding currently having since graduated. I like turning to this sub as a breath of fresh air on the internet."
blackladies,3dp9kg,bubblegumsparkles,5,Sun Jul 19 17:51:49 2015 UTC,"This sub is one of the few places I can go to to feel understood. On most other forums, whether it be in terms of my personal relationships or on social media, I feel a certain amount of pressure to filter some of my thoughts and feelings, but I don't feel that when I'm here."
blackladies,3dp9kg,thanksforalllthefish,5,Sun Jul 19 05:37:57 2015 UTC,This sub is slowly teaching me that my black is beautiful and fuck anyone who thinks otherwise.
blackladies,3dp9kg,meqek,8,Sun Jul 19 13:48:31 2015 UTC,"I'm a white girl, so I get a different perspective out of this sub. I know what the default is, I know my own experience, so subbing to a place like this is important to me. I value being a person who is open and willing to look at and accept others experience as important, so here I am."
blackladies,3dp9kg,illuminatedbishop,8,Sat Jul 18 06:28:46 2015 UTC,"yeah.  i'm an indian girl who lurks here.  this sub has taught me so much, and it also has reminded me of the privilege that i hold in society too in comparison to various other groups of people.  i am very thankful for that, and i hope that this is able to help me be a better ally to my fellow poc's.  also, i really appreciate how supportive everyone is of each other here."
blackladies,3dp9kg,thisanjali,5,Sat Jul 18 22:50:51 2015 UTC,"This, this, and this.  I live in an area with a LOT of racial tension and in particular issues with African American women.  As a white girl, this place keeps me educated about my privilege and informed about issues that very few people in my day-to-day life and my social circle are discussing."
blackladies,3dp9kg,incrediblebravery,3,Sat Jul 18 15:51:46 2015 UTC,"One of the few places online where I don't feel out of place. Where there's no racist types crapping up threads and whining all the time. Where I don't have to see slurs against women or LGBT+ people thread after thread. It's shitty enough putting up with that crap in person and it's nice to have a place where I can briefly escape that.  The mod team here does an excellent job despite the lack of support from the enabling admins like u/spez and I wish you all the best of luck. A part of me wants to leave Reddit after the recent decision to aid and abet bigots and reactionaries, but at the same time I like this subreddit and I would hate to lose it."
blackladies,3dojg2,theworldisbullshit,14,Fri Jul 17 23:27:42 2015 UTC,"Guys, just because we disagree there's no need to downvote OP since she's not being belligerent or anything.  I'm sure most are probably the usual brigaders, either way just a reminder.  OP (and another user here who I can't see their username), you've make some strong points, but I don't agree necessarily.  I remember that first  I wanted this sub or another like it to be private though like others have already pointed out, discussion will just gradually fall and there will be much less activity and different POVs.  There are Reddit lurkers, but there's also plenty of lurkers with no Reddit account that still view this sub and we'd be doing a disservice by clamping down.  That's what they want us to do - to remain silent."
blackladies,3dojg2,lottikey,3,Sat Jul 18 05:08:07 2015 UTC,I just assume this thread was being brigaded. Downvotes usually aren't flying unless obsessive racists venture over here.
blackladies,3dojg2,Afrodisiac333,7,Sat Jul 18 05:10:52 2015 UTC,"I think every thread the last day or so has been brigaded so it's pretty severe now, but I'm sure there's some normal users here disagreeing too through vote."
blackladies,3dojg2,lottikey,3,Sat Jul 18 05:38:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think some normal users are down-voting the OP. And who was the OP? Are they banned?"
blackladies,3dojg2,lovelyone20,5,Sat Jul 18 06:12:49 2015 UTC,"OP is /u/theworldisbullshit and there was another user agreeing with her but either they deleted themselves or was shadowbanned, IDK."
blackladies,3dojg2,lottikey,3,Sat Jul 18 06:40:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It does feel uncomfortable if there is too much brigading, how can some feel if this is a safe haven if they don't feel ""safe""?"
blackladies,3dojg2,lovelyone20,6,Sat Jul 18 06:47:55 2015 UTC,"No prob.  IKR?  I don't feel bad personally, I'm half laughing and half facepalming over this nonsense.  It's terrible because other black ladies may avoid this place for a while in return.  Why can't we ever have nice things?  :("
blackladies,3dojg2,lottikey,3,Sat Jul 18 06:51:00 2015 UTC,"Guys, just because we disagree there's no need to downvote OP since she's not being belligerent or anything.   Exactly. It seems like she has a legitimate interest in protecting this space."
blackladies,3dojg2,midwestprotest,28,Sat Jul 18 08:32:16 2015 UTC,"Why should rBlackLadies have to hide because OTHER PEOPLE can't be reasonable adults‽‽‽ Victim-blaming much? Why can't we target the people causing the problem here? Why should BlackLadies have to be punished by going private and making it even harder for a disenfranchised community to find them? Can we focus on the root of the problem, please?   /rant.   (Not directed at you, OP, sorry, I just hear this a lot about already harassed subs.)"
blackladies,3dojg2,Kamala_Metamorph,69,Sat Jul 18 04:58:05 2015 UTC,I would never have found this oasis if it had been a private sub.
blackladies,3dojg2,badkarmabum,11,Fri Jul 17 23:29:46 2015 UTC,Seconded.
blackladies,3dojg2,midwestprotest,32,Sat Jul 18 08:30:46 2015 UTC,"I think it would make sense to have a private sub in addition to this one. If there was such a thing. But no, it doesn't make sense to make this place private.  Look at it this way... Let's say you're a black lady. And you like reddit, and you're diggin' it. But you'd like to find other black women. So you go to the blackgirls sub and find it's has been dogged down to death by dumbasses. But you find a link to the blackladies sub after digging around. So you come here, and you find it's private. To which all you can do is say, ""Well, shit.""  We'd slowly stagnate and eventually lose members at a greater rate than gaining any. Privacy is nice, a private sub isn't  a bad idea. But locking the front door is a terrible way to host a house party."
blackladies,3dojg2,AliceHouse,5,Fri Jul 17 23:32:54 2015 UTC,"If this sub is suppose to be a safe space I don't see why is can't be private. It would cut back on the brigades, the troll posts and harassment.  Plus it's not like you can't join a private sub."
blackladies,3dojg2,wisesonAC,5,Fri Jul 17 23:38:27 2015 UTC,Message the mods about the other place it will fit your needs
blackladies,3dojg2,lovelyone20,5,Sat Jul 18 04:07:45 2015 UTC,"Plus it's not like you can't join a private sub.   You know what, that is true you can join private subs. I forgot about that. Hmm I like that we're open but sometimes it hurts to see people come here trash us.   Would it be difficult for other newbies to find us if we were private? Or would they just have to message the mods?"
blackladies,3dojg2,IrbyTremor,40,Sat Jul 18 06:11:03 2015 UTC,"Harder to find of private. One goal of this sub is to be an oasis for any Black woman whos wandered on and faced a hose of shit to the face from the sites main populace.  We are here, visible and we are taking up space. We have every right to"
blackladies,3dojg2,IrbyTremor,3,Fri Jul 17 23:44:15 2015 UTC,Making it private would cut back on the brigades and troll posts from hate subs. I think going private would make this sub better in some ways.
blackladies,3dojg2,SettleDownAlready,20,Fri Jul 17 23:47:47 2015 UTC,"We've discussed it in length and decided against it. The cons far outweigh the pros, honestly"
blackladies,3dojg2,Palkekengi,6,Fri Jul 17 23:51:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with the principle, I just sometimes feel like the personal cost to both users and mods is too high."
blackladies,3dojg2,r2jen2,-1,Sat Jul 18 01:15:39 2015 UTC,That sucks.
blackladies,3dojg2,wisesonAC,35,Fri Jul 17 23:54:35 2015 UTC,"White lady here. I don't usually comment or vote because it seems like the respectful thing to do, and it really fucking sucks that other visitors can't understand that not every space is for them. I found this sub because I was looking for some, any, reasonable voices when race-related events were in the news, and the big subs were completely bereft of civilized discussion on the topic. I stayed because I realized very quickly that I don't know anything about the struggles black ladies face. I've learned SO MUCH from this sub. Obviously you need to do what's best to protect this space, I just wanted to say that at least one lurker would really miss it."
blackladies,3dojg2,RhombusBlue,7,Sat Jul 18 02:33:05 2015 UTC,"likewise - white gal here.  I wanted to know more about black ladies' concerns, opinions, and basically to hear voices of people I otherwise wouldn't because I live in a super-white state and neighborhood and mainstream media is shitty.  Reading your posts has been eye-opening and humbling. Idk if I would request access to this sub if it were private - like, it's your space I don't want intrude. I appreciate that the sub has not been private, but you gotta do what you gotta do.  Like u/Palkekengi I was looking for civilized discussion and I definitely found it here.  So, THANK YOU for sharing openly in the meantime, regardless of what you ultimately decide to do.  A suggestion might be like, public FAQ/resources like you have on the sidebar for people like me and above but make the sub private.  Edit: some words"
blackladies,3dojg2,dratthecookies,14,Sat Jul 18 15:38:31 2015 UTC,"There's no need for THIS sub to be private. You don't talk about fight Club, feel me?"
blackladies,3dojg2,Gohte,6,Sat Jul 18 00:28:45 2015 UTC,Private web spaces are so tricky.   Reddit is a public funnel that allows people to find the safe space who might not have otherwise known it existed. That kind of exposure is hard to duplicate.
blackladies,3dojg2,mangaloree,10,Sat Jul 18 02:47:36 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, this sub is public so we attract more like minded black ladies. I don't care if some loser downvotes me, I come here for the other women who know what I live with."
blackladies,3dojg2,garnetsquarefro,8,Sat Jul 18 03:28:59 2015 UTC,I'm a white dude and I really enjoy this subreddit. If it were private I probably wouldn't ask to join just because it'd be out of place for me to do that. I just like to lurk.
blackladies,3dnbvu,wisesonAC,10,Fri Jul 17 17:47:11 2015 UTC,"Y'know I tell myself she could make videos about anything, and I'd still be smiling. Then she made a video about poop. It was the best poop video ever."
blackladies,3dnbvu,AliceHouse,10,Fri Jul 17 18:33:03 2015 UTC,Fantastic timing :3
blackladies,3dnbvu,blu3dice,7,Fri Jul 17 18:29:01 2015 UTC,This is wonderful.
blackladies,3dnbvu,exquisitedorks,6,Fri Jul 17 23:50:38 2015 UTC,"Someone here is shadowbanned. I'm seeing /u/blue3dice and /u/AliceHouse, but it registers three comments (not counting mine)"
blackladies,3dnbvu,Tyranny13,2,Fri Jul 17 21:19:03 2015 UTC,"I've seen that sort of thing as well. But all I could say is ""Whaaaat""? I wonder what happened?"
blackladies,3dnbvu,meadeater2014,6,Fri Jul 17 22:24:20 2015 UTC,Love this video! The shit you read on Reddit just makes you want to slam your head against a wall/door/window/fireplace.   Lately I've been thinking that it would be such an interesting feature to see every user's age so that you could see if all the ignorant comments came from dumb ass teenagers or if the general human population is really that lost.
blackladies,3dnbvu,Protanope,5,Sat Jul 18 08:36:13 2015 UTC,"I really love this and agree pretty much. But just a year ago I was one of those ""but all lives matter"" people. I am a white dude, and I felt like, yeah black people had it bad, but it'd be best if we just leave them alone and stop with affirmative action. I NEVER was mean about it, or troll-y or annoying, I was just a bit ignorant and uninformed. I'm glad that people reached out to me (and a lot of my other peers) about this issue. I think there are a lot more people ""in the middle"" if you will that don't quite understand, but would if they had a real conversation about race."
blackladies,3dnbvu,cavalier511,10,Sat Jul 18 03:02:20 2015 UTC,"Most people are not only resistant to conversations, but they are ignorant to facts about race. While in the past you were busy being upset over affirmative action black people may receive, statistics show that it primarily benefits white women.  I feel like a lot of white people already have the preconceived notion that black people are wrong in some way, but they don't even realize it because it's ingrained into their subconscious."
blackladies,3dnbvu,wafflebread,2,Sat Jul 18 06:44:42 2015 UTC,"I have been thinking about this a lot recently.  It's pretty clear that the isms aren't going away. It's also clear to me that confronting people with their isms doesn't work.  No one likes to be told they are wrong or have bad ideas. Most people aren't clever/resilient or flexible enough to admit they are. Being told that one is an ist is often enough to entrench positions rather than change them (men's rights ""Reverse racism"" anyone?).  Most ists aren't woman beaters or kkk members. Most ists don't think they are ists.   To link all this to your point:  I have been reading a lot about unconscious bias recently. What it really brings to the fore is that most people don't even really know what they think or feel about stuff. Me included. I grew up in probably the most ethnically diverse area of the world, studied anthropology and am well travelled.   But I am still a middle class white man from a first world country. And even if I weren't I wouldn't be immune. Black people living in those environments are raised with the same subconscious bias from living in those environments. Some links to things I have been reading.  http://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2015/jul/08/how-can-we-fix-unconscious-racism  I think that this is a written version of a radio program I heard:  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-32740523  It's about police shootings but has a lot of valuable information in.   Anyway, I am rambling, I just woke up.   http://www.fairimpartialpolicing.com/bias/ Edit: better link for unconscious bias"
blackladies,3dnbvu,RassimoFlom,2,Sat Jul 18 07:55:40 2015 UTC,"I think there are a lot more people who are willing to have their minds changed than you think. Reddit is NOT representative of normal 16-25 year olds at all. We are one of the more open and progressive generations, race conversations are tedious, but do work more often than you'd think."
blackladies,3dnbvu,cavalier511,7,Sat Jul 18 17:51:10 2015 UTC,"I feel like if I look at tumblr I could believe that...reddit is also overwhelmingly white and male, which exclused a lot of other groups of people. It's hard for me to have a lot of hope tbh :<"
blackladies,3dnbvu,wafflebread,3,Sat Jul 18 17:53:08 2015 UTC,The problem with reddit is group think. You get a lot of young white guys together with very little life experience and they begin to echo the same sentiments off of each other. Ignorance is easy when there's a million other users being ignorant right along side you.
blackladies,3dnbvu,Cammadore64,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:01:07 2015 UTC,"Oh well yeah, good luck ever getting reddit to listen to reason. But honestly, I don't care what reddit thinks as much as I care what people in my life/my peers think because that actually has an impact. Redditors are stubborn."
blackladies,3dnbvu,cavalier511,11,Sat Jul 18 18:19:39 2015 UTC,"For every one person I have met who is open to conversation about race, there are five more who SAY they want conversation, and then refuse to acknowledge that a lot of common beliefs held by Americans today have racist foundations. These are people who could watch Akala and Laci Green break down systemic racism into a concept middle schoolers can understand, and would just reply with ""so how is me choosing to ignore racism racist? My feelings are hurt, and THATS the real racism.""  I had high hopes for a lot of people that I've cut off now. But I've found the few and far in between who are capable of learning and thinking outside of the status quo. Keep learning and listening, you'll be surprised at what you find."
blackladies,3dnbvu,Tyranny13,6,Sat Jul 18 06:00:17 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It so often disingenuous that it's like, jeez, I wonder why I have so many ulcers.  At a certain point I go ""Fuck you, pay me.""  If you want a full time race nanny or empathy coach, shell out the money and I'll treat you like I have any real interest to invest in your decency.  Edit to add: No takers yet. A grump can dream :( If I had a dollar for every ridiculous fake ""discussion"", unsolicited hair fondle and ""HaHaHaHa, I'm blacker than you!"" comment,  I'd be Scrooge McDuck rich."
blackladies,3dnbvu,source_codeine,4,Sat Jul 18 15:39:58 2015 UTC,"Aaaall of this. My roots are too nappy to have to catch all that ""but muh heritage and muh feelz cuz someone called me racist"" bullshit."
blackladies,3dnbvu,Tyranny13,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:26:04 2015 UTC,"I personally think the internet stifles this kind of conversation more than real life. Online you can find any opinion and somewhat of a justification. In real life people are a lot more understanding and able to ask questions back rather than just feel like they are being yelled at. Believe me, when I was stupid I felt like all of those people on the internet (maybe not Laci, I've been a long time fan) were just preachy and I couldn't connect. Then I just made friends with an activist and thought, ""hmm, that's actually very valid and reasonable""."
blackladies,3dnbvu,cavalier511,5,Sat Jul 18 17:55:04 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought too, until I tried having these conversations in real life. That's where I found that no amount of hand-holding and coddling is enough for someone with a severe case of white fragility. No matter what statistics or historical references I bring up, it always comes back to ""Racism only exists because people keep bringing it up!"" You can't educate someone who wants to stay dumb and comfy. Especially if they aren't inclined to listen to you because you're ""angry,"" ""oversensitive,"" and ""antagonistic"", i.e. black. And then you watch your white friend tell them the exact same things you said, while being even harsher about it, and lo and behold, NOW they understand. Its ridiculous on so many levels."
blackladies,3dnbvu,Tyranny13,2,Sat Jul 18 18:23:21 2015 UTC,"That's really unfortunate :( I guess I'm lucky to be in a liberal area at a liberal college. Haha, I remember the days of ""what if we just forget about race? Bringing race up only makes it worse."" Which honestly, really made sense to me. I wish it were as easy as that! Too bad it's systematically engrained in our culture."
blackladies,3dnbvu,cavalier511,3,Sat Jul 18 18:34:46 2015 UTC,"I suppose she is just speaking more about the trolls and complete idiots though, which, hopefully aren't as numerous as the people like me, who were just misinformed, but open to learning."
blackladies,3dma6y,GeneralBuhari,21,Fri Jul 17 12:38:20 2015 UTC,"The mods need to send the WaPo and other major media outlets all the evidence of harassment, nasty photos, and all communications between them and the admins. If undeniable proof that is reported that the admins knew about all that and did nothing, the admins will renege on their stance of not banning the racist subs.  Nothing will be worse for them than bad press and even less of a chance to properly monetize the site. Not to mention if it gets enough traction, celebrities will be less inclined to do AMAs because it's extremely bad PR to have any association with Stormfront Jr."
blackladies,3dma6y,bakerowl,67,Fri Jul 17 20:22:37 2015 UTC,"I can't think of a more concrete example to show that reddit just does not give a fuck about black people. I mean honestly, a sub where a lifestyle choice is ridiculed is (rightly) banned, but a sub that glorifies one of history's greatest genocides? Nope, not a problem!"
blackladies,3dma6y,denversocialist,10,Fri Jul 17 14:20:02 2015 UTC,I think not banning is just a another decision that they will have to back out of.  They have said several things only to go back and change their minds.
blackladies,3dma6y,veronyca73,25,Fri Jul 17 15:23:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think they will change their minds until they get more bad press. At some point we have to stop wondering why they don't do the right thing, especially when they keep showing us with their actions that they do not care about black people."
blackladies,3dma6y,Blank_username,21,Fri Jul 17 16:14:47 2015 UTC,"At some point we have to stop wondering why they don't do the right thing   If white people almost shut down the default subs over firing an employee or banning fatpeoplehate, what does it say about us just writing angry worded letters (and posting more evidence of inciteful hate speech and threats) in the hope they'll address festering racism on this site?  Seriously, Reddit will continue to tolerate those content as long as we can't do the right thing (not affiliating our communities with Reddit), given all the evidence in the world that they'll never get it."
blackladies,3dma6y,veronyca73,17,Fri Jul 17 16:42:01 2015 UTC,"I agree. I have been on reddit for four years and the Admins basically got comfortable sitting on their asses and letting redditors  turn the board into mini fiefdoms. They should have seen the writing on the wall with the Violent Acres debacle, but they did not pay attention. Now this shit is snowballing and they are will be forced to act because the media is not going to let up anytime soon.   We just have to keep the spotlight on the toxic subs and force the Admins to make the changes they will have to make sooner than later. They are prolonging the inevitable."
blackladies,3dma6y,concise_dictionary,19,Fri Jul 17 16:28:17 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it, but I'm not really surprised. Angry and furious and sad and just pissed off, yes. But not really surprised, because the admins have such a bad track record of choosing not to deal with the racist stuff on reddit."
blackladies,3dma6y,dratthecookies,35,Fri Jul 17 19:02:22 2015 UTC,"These subs are acceptable because they're only ""offensive"" to black people. When the world wakes up and realizes that racism is an abomination to humanity things might change. I would have loved to see reddit take a stand like that. But sadly nope. And I remain unsurprised."

blackladies,3dninj,newman91,25,Fri Jul 17 18:37:37 2015 UTC,Working on it! Will post soon about a project.
blackladies,3dninj,supcaci,6,Fri Jul 17 19:01:48 2015 UTC,send it out to all the black people on twitter.  boycott their advertisers.  boycott the investors.  it'll get done.  i hear that snoop dogg is a major investor in reddit.  wonder if he knows about this bs.
blackladies,3dninj,redditboycott,9,Fri Jul 17 19:52:03 2015 UTC,"Black Twitter is a good start but not enough.   Will share these tidbits since I worked in marketing and media:    Black Twitter is the swarm that puts the real work in to contact and shout out those who really have the power. Look at the AMAs. Who participates? Who do they work for? Are NASA, video game corps, TV networks, and the rest cool with having their workers or representatives do AMAs on a board that hosts hate subs? Some probably are, but I bet most don't realize that Reddit has these types of subs. Black Twitter needs to start @ mentioning these corps/networks/gov't agencies/celebrities and asking them why they support a website that condones hate speech by allowing their workers or stars to do AMAs. Trust me, a company/ gov't agency/network will quickly backtrack or promise no more AMAs when they are faced with having to answer for someone else's bullshit and fuckery. Hashtag has to make sure it encompasses the idea of no support of Reddit via no AMAs. And also have to highlight the issue. More than one hash will probably be necessary. Politicians who did AMAs on here need to be called out. Especially, the ones who are currently running for office. They should be asked why they support a site that supports hate speech so much so that it's worse than Stormfront at this point. And asked why people should vote for them when they are pandering to a site that is on the level of Stormfront. Sit back and watch the denouncement and retractions come rolling in.  Celebrities need to be called out too on social media regarding the same thing.    6. The absolute most important. Snoop, Jerod Leto, and a bunch of other celebrities fund Reddit via investments. Call them all the way out on Twitter and in other forms of social media. Especially Snoop. Strike where the money is: investors. Call out Advance Publications and call for a off all of its publications. Contact Black celebs, politicians, and the like who have been featured in or on the cover of their publications.  The point is, the folks at Reddit simply don't care and the issue isn't getting as much attention. What gets attention is burning a fire under politicians, gov't agencies, companies, TV networks, and celebrities. All of these people/entities are very egoistic. They will denounce loudly to clear their names since no one wants to be directly related to racism. Their denouncing will bring a ridiculous amount of attention to Reddit.   That's what I'd suggest. I predict that most Black people won't care, though, because most don't read Reddit and aren't interested in it. But, you never know.   Tip: Never rely on the little guys to change anything. Most of the time, you shouldn't even ask them to change anything. Always strike at the head first. Always. The head here is investors, celebrities, TV networks, video game companies, gov't agencies, politicians, any academics/authors who have done AMAs. These types of people and entities DO NOT want to look bad in the public eye. Any threat to their image and they'll start a firestorm to protect. Never appeal to reason because it rarely works in an image-obsessed society. Appeal to protecting an image by making a subtle attack on it."
blackladies,3dninj,Confetti-In-My-Pants,9,Sat Jul 18 00:08:07 2015 UTC,I have a feeling if we involve black Twitter reddit would just ban this subreddit
blackladies,3dninj,bakerowl,18,Fri Jul 17 20:13:09 2015 UTC,"And have articles up the ass on Salon, the WaPo, and whatnot that Reddit banned a safe space for black women to discuss topics, but kept all the racist subreddits?"

blackladies,3dninj,msqualah,6,Fri Jul 17 21:09:29 2015 UTC,"U underestimate the potential for harm to black people in subs like CT. There are black lives at stake. These subs will grow and that hate will continue to infect other subs. You've seen this.   If reddits admin won't budge then we have to shine a light into this cesspool of hate. Being on reddit is like being on stormfront. That would be like a Jew reading Mein Kampf everyday. I don't think black people should be subject to this.  I have seen what the mods have to deal with everyday and its heartbreaking. I'd be willing to risk closing this sub if reddit does not change. But don't fret, they wont close this sub."
blackladies,3dninj,AliceHouse,4,Fri Jul 17 21:26:50 2015 UTC,Honestly we can make this sub private if it comes to that.
blackladies,3dninj,kikkai,2,Fri Jul 17 21:30:43 2015 UTC,Well I know I'm late but let me know if there's anything I maybe able to help with. All for bringing awareness to the issues we face everyday for being born with melanin.
blackladies,3dninj,supcaci,4,Sat Jul 18 06:33:18 2015 UTC,"I think I should get a phone so I can get twitter.  Y'know I'm wondering. Twitter is so poppin' you aint even got to add the adjective of black before it to denote it's user base. It's implicit. Yet, what is it about reddit that in spite of having a sizable black population, is best known as a site of white supremacy. I mean, clearly, ""Black Reddit"" might ought to be a thing, non?  So weird. Why am I here? Why are any of us here and not some place like twitter?"

Seeing first hand the mentality and the service they sit through its ridiculous. The preacher he listens to speaks hate on all other religions and spend a good amount of time cussing them out. His father has pretty much truncated relationships with his family and even his son due to his faith. He seems lonely inside but the visage of cockiness is all that's spewed to the public.
blackladies,3dpctf,himynameismaryjane,4,Sat Jul 18 14:10:03 2015 UTC,"My father believes in that stuff. It changed him a lot. He now thinks he's better than everyone else because he's black and other people aren't. He has gotten so bitter over the stupidest shit, ex. He gets angry when he sees people eating pork sometimes, or if he sees a gay person on TV. I don't even know how a person can live with so much anger and bitterness in their heart. A part of me wants to talk him out of this, but I don't think it would end well."

They spoke about different Caribbean countries being the lost tribes. I don't date inter-religiously so no, I won't date one."

She didn't like me when we first met, but was real cool with me when she found out I wasn't mixed. Her religion automatically takes 20% of each check. She has told me that they force children (even newborns!!) to fast, and says it like it's totally normal. I think the church is freaking crazy, her folks and church members are crazy. She has told me about how her preacher will single out church members as sinners and preach and condemn directly to them during sermons. She also used to get personally insulted when my friends and I ate pork in front of her, but she got over it quickly because I shut that down. I (and other friends) don't let her enforce her religion into my life, and she quickly learnt not to. But when we leave religion completely off the table, she's a decent person, albeit a bit naïve."

blackladies,3dndu4,mangaloree,21,Sun Jul 19 21:52:09 2015 UTC,"AsABlackMan, I think it's because racists are often sexists (which /r/blackfellas itself doesn't lack), and they also love the attention they get here more than in our sub, especially since this sub seems to be the more active one. Because of their sexism, most of the coontown brigade in /r/blackfellas is usually in the form of 'logical' or 'rational' (pseudoscientific) arguments that are easy to disprove unlike  the ones here that are subjective and focus on eurocentric standards, and physical violence."
blackladies,3dndu4,GeneralBuhari,10,Fri Jul 17 20:13:07 2015 UTC,"I really think it's largely the moderation difference.  I've seen some really suspect comments/posts on /r/blackfellas...like sometimes you can't even tell the difference between a white racist dude or a self-hating black dude up in there.  I think it's less about white guys being afraid of black guys especially on a site where they greatly outnumber them.  IRL that is the case, but online these same white cowards would have more of a voice shit-talking the black guys because it's simply way easier to when you can easily hide behind their screens and there's way more of them to do so.    OK so this is wild...but this thread is reminding me of that one comment I read on /r/blackfellas where a lot of these racist white guys have some serious cuckold fantasies with black guys.

After class, this fool came to ask me out for lunch...WTF.  So yeah, I wouldn't put even the craziest explanations behind some of these people."

You ladies have been livid for the last couple days and are making easy targets for bullies who thrive off that reaction. Further, being able to point at the stereotype  of the ""angry black woman"", in their minds, bolsters their ideology. I imagine yokels in a log cabin slapping their knees saying ""Gosh dang it Cletus, you got that sheboon good"" * high pitched cackle *  I've been looking at /r/blackladies all day and feeling torn. On one hand I want to be up in arms with you and on the other hand I'm thinking ""Why don't we just quietly make a plan to get out of here.""   All the anger at spez is bewildering to me - he is running a multimillion dollar enterprise that has made him a rich man and promises to make him a ton more; can you imagine what Reddit could sell for now? He will ALWAYS choose the money. What I think is going on behind the scenes is that Reddit, able to see who really subscribes to or just visits CoonTown, knows that  is risks losing a significant number of users to sites like 4chan and stormfront. Not only visible subscribers, but the people who will follow the CoonTown spectacle to another site if they were kicked off. User time = money.  As someone mentioned, Blackfellas isn't nearly as active as here and even then, it's not really possible to elicit any black male stereotype 1) Because black redditors tend to be intelligent, self-aware and non-violent...like most black people not portrayed in the mainstream media 2) None of the predominant black male stereotypes translate that well on the text-based internet anyway.   Also agreed that the racists are afraid, to their very core, of black men. If you terrorize a man's forefathers, women and children as a way of life for centuries, the day he wakes up, you're gonna get your ass beat."
blackladies,3dndu4,zimboombah,8,Sat Jul 18 03:08:49 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with this...they would still hound us even without all the related threads and that new /r/FuckCoonTown sub because we're simply just an easier target.  Maybe at first, there's a certain threshold where they get a big kick out of us getting loud, but we're pass that point where it's safe for them to do so without any repercussions.  It's been shown that this sub can get enough site-wide attention on their actions and that we're not too small that them doing the worse will be completely ignored.  It only seems like so much because of recent happenings.  At least 85% of the time, there is no special attention or mention to CT and the rest of Chimpire.  It largely flairs up during news fiascos like unarmed black people getting murdered or during major site announcements concerning hate subs.  I got hate mail (and I'm sure plenty others here) when I was still mostly lurking here.  I dropped a few comments and that's enough for a dimwit to start harassing.  It wouldn't change a bit if we're more quiet or silent.  Just only people would assume there was no problem in the first place.  It only seems that we attract a lot of extreme reactions (also clarify this) because so few (small) subs experience constant harassment and actually bring it to light."

Maybe they do, but it doesn't bother them--they don't take it personally because they don't find the statements true in any sense, so they shrug them off.  Maybe they feel that as long as they're behind a computer screen, and would be unlikely to say any of the things they say online to the face of a Black man, the nastygrams only serve to underscore the weakness and cowardice of those who take the time to type and send them.  I mean, I think male culture is much more used to shit-talking amongst themselves, and much better at shrugging it off."

Maybe it depends on the career ( mine is education). It's funny, my son and I were having this same conversation about this topic. We have always had in depth no filter conversations and I will paraphrase what he said:   "" BW are treated worse because BW are now the new niggas, and BM are relieved that it's not them at the bottom anymore.  Then BW get pissed because they get treated like shit as anyone would and it provides entertainment for all.  It's not right but that's how I see it"". Long sigh from me.  I didn't want to go into why some BM are so dismissive and seem to join in on the entertainment because we are both very passionate and to be honest, the urge to slap the mess out of him scared me as to why, and I need to find a healthier method to deal with so much anger. So much anger.  Sorry for the wall of rambling text. I need a break from all of this. To recharge.  I just hate to see our mods go through so much shit. They get no breaks so why should I?

My Black male friends deal with 1000% more shit from strangers and the law than I do. For example, I get pulled over for speeding, cop shakes his head and says ""Now young lady, just don't do that again!"" My Black dude friends get pulled over, and they gotta get out of the car, hands on the hood, car is searched, full patdown, blah blah blah.

We are trying to see if we want to try again, but afraid of just getting burned again. Any past experiences y'all could share?"

I've gotten back together with an ex and a half. <edited out details>  So both times, they were good reminders (for him in that case, and for me, in the other case) of the good reasons we originally broke up, and reminded us what starry eyed memories had forgotten. I don't regret the original relationship, I don't regret getting back together (there were still positives) and I don't regret being single again. Though, I now have journal entries and will use them if necessary, if he thinks we are getting back together a third time!    tl;dr. It depends why you broke up, and if those reasons have changed. i.e, if you broke up because y'all moved, great. If you broke up because of maturity, ~maybe~. If you broke up because personality and values........ :-/ communicate."

Then you ask him to do the same and why you became ""the ex"" in his list of the good, the bad, the ugly. I personally have learned that my relationship was drowning in fights and arguments was because me and my girlfriend were not in SYCHRONIZATION as she was not willing to compromise on issues that I felt were very important to compromise such as living with your girlfriend/boyfriend before marriage while she wanted the total opposite. Sometimes the small things can be the reason relationships don't last, pinpoint yours and his and good luck :)"

I worked like a 60-65 hour work week and pulled an effin all nighter at work and got back home at like 4 PM the next day... I'm not too happy and my sleeping schedule is messed up. Also, I'm a bit pissed about that stupid Spez thread and how he has the power to do SOOOOO much good for not only the reddit communities at large, but for real world communities, but the admins on this site are consistently not rising to the task. I don't know how they can sleep at night knowing that the website they spent years in creating, their treasure, their joy, is fostering and spreading hatred towards everybody except those who are in the white, male, and straight demographic. Honestly, at this point, it's become a crime and your identity may eventually come into ridicule if you're not the 3 aforementioned things on this site. That a good person can create a site which overall culture has become a symbol of hatred, intolerance, and backwards viewpoints of the 1800s and not have that personally affect them, especially if you're the one that created it, then I don't know, something's wrong.   And what makes me even more upset, is that this stupid site is doing real-world damage. When your little sister repeats the racist, sad, untrue things about her own freaking race, that's when it hit you. That I'm old enough, I know this ish is garbage. Those that are still impressionable (kids and teens) soak up this harmful content and begin to repeat it and believe it and they are on this site probably more than adults. When your black sister is attempting to struggle through her thoughts about the church shootings then somehow begins derailing about how only black people riot and other very harmful copypaste things that I read word for word on this site, it was an eye-opener. This website is ruining the younger generation. And hey call me dramatic, but if the most upvoted threads you read have something racist, sexist, homophobic, what have you, and you're a kid, then you're less able to contextualize or think critically for yourself since you don't quite have yet the intelligence of experience.     I just don't understand what is specifically stopping Spez for doing what needs to be done. This has nothing at all to do with free speech. Banning harmful, damaging, bullying subreddits is not impeaching on anyone's free speech. Because guess what, ultimate free speech as a concept does not exist. It's an ideal, a goal for a perfect society where everyone excercising their right of free speech does not impose on someone else's right to free speech. Any environment in the real world sets limits to speech because hey, that's how our society works. I'm not going to go into my grocery store and start yelling at the clerk and start spouting threats. That will get my butt in jail. FREE SPEECH is non-existant once it escapes from my mouth. What actually does exist is the ability to say whatever we want as most of us were gifted with voices. What is not real (and what these very confused individuals on Reddit love to rant about) is the notion that there should be no consequences for speech. Free speech does not mean you get to say anything you want and everyone will just have to accept that you said it and there shouldn't be any consequences. What the efff? Everything you say and do will ALWAYS be used for you or against you. This is real life, and in real life, people are held accountable for what they say."

I have no idea who this Eathan Carter the Third is but his match against Kurt Angle was damn impressive. The jabrone took a dozen German suplexes. And he's got this smarmy ass jerk face smile that's perfect for a heel that you just know he's practiced for hours in the mirror.  I don't know who Awesome Kong is either. And while I'm all set to root for her, I don't know what she was thinking with the name Awesome Kong. I know Kong is a surname for some Asian peoples, but she aint Asian and I don't think that's the sorta Kong that comes to mind for most people. It's actually a bit upsetting and I'd like to hear what her thoughts are on this.  The WWE meanwhile still loves it's borderline and up to crossing the line minstrel crap."

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me :)  Edit: Her name is basically a rip off of a famous Japanese female wrestler named Aja Kong. Basically, Aja Kong had a falling out with the wrestling company that Awesome Kong was being trained by and since the poster for their wrestling show advertised a match featuring ""A. Kong"", the company took their trainee and named her Amazing Kong. TNA changed it to Awesome Kong so that they could own her name."

blackladies,3dn1rj,amelia84,2,Sun Jul 19 03:03:40 2015 UTC,That's sounds awesome!

I'm leaning towards Web Developer myself.

You don't have to see him anymore, and it sucks to be him 'cause it's his loss. When relationships end, the human mind and soul go through a grieving period. It's ok to have all these mixed emotions because that's the natural human process.  But if it didn't end well. Then y'know, you collect more flies with poop than with honey."
blackladies,3dn1rj,AliceHouse,2,Fri Jul 17 22:57:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it ended ok, it wasn't a big blowout or anything. We still text each other, although clearly not as much as we used to.

blackladies,3dlsfm,RhombusBlue,18,Fri Jul 17 12:39:50 2015 UTC,"Y'know what the worst part is? Because I can always find the worst in things. The worst part is, in the history of America, this is the best it's been for black people. How fucked up is that. But you're still worth something. We are. And everyone before us, our ancestors, all meant something.  I'm hardly the best to give advice on this topic. I'm rather alone myself all the time. It's just I'm the sort that can enjoy better, it sounds like you're someone who needs to be around people. Which is great, because people can be awesome. When you say you lost all your friends after moving, does that mean there was drama and they won't talk to you no more? Otherwise, we live in a day and age where long distance communication is great. But I understand having the sort of friends who might not want to talk back on a phone or skype.  White people can be quite challenging. But it is ok to have white friends. It's just you might want to keep them at arms length to protect yourself. One or two out of a hundred may be surprisingly cool though. But you don't have to educate them, you don't owe them shit. They've got google.  But what worries me more is some of your comments are self harming. And that is a topic with which while I'm no expert, I certainly have experience. I used to cut myself, burn myself, rip my hair out, and treat my body like I was starring in Jackass. What I know about this behavior is that it's something you struggle with because it's not something that goes away. It's addictive in nature, and ought to be treated as such. But it also stems from somewhere. I know in my case, I had a pretty shitty childhood.  The best thing to do is start with therapy. Which, I know, is it's own trial to deal with. But it's worth it. I know some places have sliding scale fees if money is an issue, and that it should be offered at any college if you're in one. What's important is finding someone that you can talk to that understands. By this I do mean another woman of color. Doesn't necessarily need to be a black woman, my old therapist was Hawaiian. She had a fucking clue that I wouldn't have been offered from most white folk.  I'm not a doctor though. I just know I don't want you to hurt yourself, I don't want you to eat a bullet. But I know the reasons you're feeling that way are legit. All I ask is you do your best to take care of yourself, ok? Life is a struggle and sometimes we can't all be that ""strong black woman."" It's ok to cry."

They've got google.   Optimism...lol...not really.   That's so true though...the moment I realized that I don't owe even my friends education...waves of peace man...waves. It's so tricky though because of the way White people structure their friendships. They'll put you in the role of ""Minority educator"" and will set up subtle rewards and punishments around your behavior in that role. I've have good, decent White people in my life do this. It's not even always malicious...it's just how they function."

I am lucky to have three white people in my life who I have helped wake the fuck up about the shit happening to us but they are also far away too. Don't waste your time educating stupid ass people unless they mean a lot to you is what I have learned. I have also learned that you might find some rare snowflake white people who are not clueless but just need their eyes opened to how much shit we deal with and all I do is share shit on facebook and they take their own time to read. I don't have any time to be educating anyone else when I'm educating myself. I can't speak for anyone else but I'm with you and I wish we could have our own reddit black ladies chat weekly or something because self care is necessary as hell.

blackladies,3dlsfm,eroverton,6,Fri Jul 17 19:18:46 2015 UTC,"Just my opinion and I am not any kind of professional.  But what helps me when I get that level of depressed is to get involved in something, but it has to be something meaningful, not just a random hobby. For me, because I am sick to death of this bullshit society, I find relief in the idea that I can separate myself from it, along with other people who are equally sick of this shit. So I get involved in activism, specifically the kind that does NOT involve trying to gain better treatment from white people, but the kind that focuses on self-sufficient independence. That's just me, but you might want to try it. It's a lot more satisfying feeling like being a part of trying something new (or old, if you think about it) than the feeling of trying to climb a sand dune in scuba flippers while jumping rope. Which is what I consider about the equivalent of us trying to gain acceptance and fair treatment and justice from this society.

Nas' has a lyric that goes: ""Life's a bitch but ill be damn if the bitch divorce me.""  I've been there. Thinking about just ending it all, but i never did and never will. I wouldn't give the enemy the satisfaction of seeing me go like that. I wouldn't break my family's heart by going out like that. Why? Because I'm worth it. And so are you.

blackladies,3dlsfm,lottikey,3,Fri Jul 17 15:23:53 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it's because we're largely unreported when it comes to suicide attempts and whatnot.  Plus the stereotype of 'strong black woman' does way more harm than good: if it's not us refusing to address our mental ills, it's others downplaying it because they think we're impervious to depression and suicide.  And even when it comes to other kinds of mental ills like schizophrenia, ADD, ADHD, etc. we're just seen as violent or crazy and continually shamed/brutalized for it.  I'm sure in real terms, our rates are through the roofs.  This is health and our health rates as a group in the US are among the lowest.  And who has money to pay for treatment these days."

Its not so much that they are ignorant inbred country boys with general Lee's flag stamped on their truck, I believe that many of them are educated and somewhat successful people, they THINK what they say they BELIEVE what they say. I personally believe that they cannot be educated or changed into better people, they simply are bad, mean, hateful bastards, who for whatever reason have chosen to throw their hate at black people.

I think it's one of the hardest parts of moving to a new place. I bet you can build a new social circle in your new town though.

blackladies,3dlsfm,Mur-cie-lago,4,Fri Jul 17 20:00:02 2015 UTC,"White lady here. Just wanted to say while I can't possibly comprehend the extent of your frustration, I do understand it. Because people suck. Really. Tremendously. And white people sure do suck a lot when it comes to not being shitty to the black community. I try every day to not contribute to the problem, and do my best to actively work against it whenever possible. But no matter how much I try, I'm sure I could do more.  Anyway I just wanted to say that I care about you. As an individual. As a person. And I hope that you find a better way to deal with your (very valid) frustration than self harm. Because you matter and the world needs you. Your opinions do matter. Yes, they are constantly drowned out by asshole ignorant or plain hateful people, but there are others, like me, and the awesome ladies here, who care immensely about what you think and feel and hear you loud and clear through the din of hate."

Also, overall, do you believe that you, the founders, and other employees of the site feel a personal responsibility to Reddit? Usually when people join firms, they have to make sure they abide by the firm's values and ethics. Do you all have a code of ethics, a mission statement, any set of guidelines and rules that most firms usually have to ensure that their vision is being upheld and that their brand is maintained by its employees? What is the culture of Reddit in the office? What ties everyone together?    Maybe that's what missing. Most companies' ethics and values are intrinsically tied to doing what's good for the people, enhancing well-being, and some how tying into the fact that their service provides a net positive. This sense of purpose encourages those who work for the company. In addition, it continually attracts consumers to the company as it creates ethical guidelines for employees to make decisions, sometimes difficult ones. With that being said, it is quite doubtful that many employers will allow their product and their culture to be warped and contorted so much that it literally has become a symbol of hate to everyone who does not use Reddit, and even more troubling, to most everyone who does. This is your product, right? Your baby?  Is this what founders foresaw when they made Reddit and admins when they manage it? If it's not, then I just don't quite understand, what's stopping those with the power to do what's needed.      Reddit has had lots of time to build and breed a Reddit community ​that ​no one wants to be publicly seen as part of. In fact, the continued hesitancy to enact change is making change more difficult in the long run. When your little sister is reciting racist points on her entire race that reads word for word as comments on this site, then this is a problem. Hatred, wherever it is expressed and whichever form, bleeds into communities. It has overtaken the Reddit community that you now have people defending hatred, and it has infiltrated the real world, where you have little sisters hating a piece of their identity for unfounded, and quite, illogical reasons. Does anyone who works for Reddit feel any obligation to this site and to ensure that it is instead serving as a bastion of positivity?   ​Anyway, you guys are admins. You made this site. I think it's about time you start moderating its content. You guys are the ultimate mods, after all.  Don't let others who this site was never designed for (as you claim) ruin it for everyone, especially you."
blackladies,3dl9c7,curiiouscat,8,Fri Jul 17 20:35:34 2015 UTC,"Why do you think none of your previous co-workers have stamped down on said speech?    My guess is that they're afraid the community wouldn't stand for it. I think they're especially gun-shy after being burned a few weeks ago in the Victoria revolt. But here's the thing -- the default mods exercising their power was scary because it showed that they really do have a lot of power. If they're unhappy, it jeopardizes the entire site, the business, everything. Reddit can't afford to piss them off.  What I'm trying to show by starting the sidebar campaign is that the vast majority of the significant subreddits' moderators would either actually support a total hate speech ban, or at least not object to one. I believe this to be true, and I believe that if it were demonstrated to the reddit leadership, they'd have the reassurance necessary to do what's right.   do you believe that you, the founders, and other employees of the site feel a personal responsibility to Reddit?   Yes -- most especially the founders. Remember, when reddit was first founded, Steve and Alexis banned bigoted speech on sight, not for monetization purposes or anything like that, but simply because they didn't want that shit to be associated with their baby. We need to show them that reddit (or, at least, the vast majority of the redditors who create and enrich the community that attracts so many people to come here every day when they're probably supposed to be working) wants them to return to leading from their instincts and doing what they know is right.   I just don't quite understand, what's stopping those with the power to do what's needed.   They need to see a show of support from the community. We have to show them that spez won't be run out of town on a rail if he shuts down the very small, very very loud, safe havens for bigotry that have formed on the site during his absence."
blackladies,3dl9c7,Starwhisperer,6,Fri Jul 17 22:20:22 2015 UTC,It makes me so sad that the terrible trolls of the Internet could be the reason people in charge are afraid to act. Fear shouldn't be the motivator for decisions. :( thank you for doing your part.
blackladies,3dl9c7,GottaGetToIt,4,Fri Jul 17 22:24:59 2015 UTC,"The reason that the default mods are pissed off is a different matter than this discussion. From my understanding, the mods are pissed off because they weren't given the tools needed for their tasks and they weren't informed when decisions were made that would affect the operation of their subreddits. I just repeated everything you know already, but I doubt the mods are mad about the admins taking a stance on hate speech and following the likes of every respectable organization in the world.    And yep, totally agree with your second point and the sidebar campaign sounds like a step in a direction, but which? Communities usually thrive when they are led by strong-willed, principled leaders. There needs to be some sense of authority and vision from the admins that can go on to shape the culture and guide its evolution. When this doesn't happen, the entire site is left in this sort of gray area where everything goes. The mods sometimes say this, and the admins at times claims that but do this, hmm redditors are allowed to do this? It's simply inconsistent and indecisive, which leaves your users deciding on their own how they will choose to engage with this site.     Well, Steve and Alexis had the most common sense idea in the beginning and should not need to be applauded for doing what is expected. This entire mess is because they failed to stick with it and because they did not set any strong rules regarding harmful content. That this is even a question. That right now we are having a discussion whether a community shall accept content that has been since banished and reeks of the 1800s and promotes violence and harassment to any identity besides what society considers to be the ""default"" one is quite surreal.     And yep, agree with you on the last paragraph. However, the way the conversation is being held in this sort of environment makes it difficult for affirmative speech to rise the top. Because one, it is silenced by voting mechanism. Reddit loves to rage and redditors love reading it. Two, the way we talk about the decision is being framed around ""free speech"" due to years of unmoderated Reddit, so now, anything that anyone does and say will reek of injustice. Three, it should be common sense. To suggest that everyday normal people need to go above and beyond to support leaders when they do the right, common sense, thing is sort of interesting. It's a given. Plus you have tons and tons of people already supporting and calling out Admins to do something. Your community already supports this, so again, why the stalling on their part? Reddit is not going to just get up and leave if that's what they're afraid of. This site has passed that point with its popularity and plus, it won't be an unpopular decision. And like you acknowledge, the community will be made better for it.   Anyway, I understand your points. Do what you got to do. Thanks for caring."

Other than Pao, I firmly believe the top Reddit admins always love this drama, and outrage, and trolling. The pain that this causes is icing on top. They relate much more readily to the Chimpire subs than to any of us.   With these new rules, there will be many more racist subscribers since they have to get (free, easy) accounts to browse the largest hate community on the web. Now they won't be passive, but active Reddit contributors. And there's nothing to stop these new members from going everywhere else spreading bile, ""dindu nuffin"" jokes, and racist copypasta. Things will be worse, and any black person could have told them that, but the admins don't care. They just got officially sanctioned as part of the Reddit platform.  I knew that there was no way one of the founders of Reddit would ever understand how bad it is to lead one of the largest platforms for hate in the world. That's what Reddit is, and I think maybe they're proud of the notoriety.   For many years I've loathed the Chan mentality that celebrates inhumanity for the sake of edge. This hypocritical website is actually worse! I'm disgusted with myself for being here and participating in subreddits that don't tear this place a new one every day.

blackladies,3djni8,Gunvorsejl,23,Thu Jul 16 22:56:44 2015 UTC,"Reddit's underlying philosophy is anarchocapitalist, and as long as the genuine  black subs stay here they lend reddit as a brand some legitimacy (of at least not being 4chan), and so will continue to tolerate hate subs for as long as possible. That's why they keep coming up with arbitrary rules when threatened  by the presence  certain subs (FPH recently).    They've proved time and time again they will prioritise racists and coontown over black people,  the message is clear that the only solution is to leave reddit by going private or moving to another site. The threat of that alone and the media fallout if carried out will send a far stronger message to the admins, Reddit community and advertisers  than having to plead with them to stop racism. If it doesn't boggle the mind that one's humanity should be up for debate or under the banner  of ""free exchange of ideas"",  any more than raping women is just free expression, then Reddit will never address our issues."

blackladies,3djni8,marsyred,15,Thu Jul 16 21:27:14 2015 UTC,Money. Page views. They know the majority of the userbase would destroy reddit and walk out if they started banning white supremacy.

blackladies,3djni8,cluelessperson,9,Fri Jul 17 06:00:08 2015 UTC,Page views are page views. Advertisers only care when it hurts their brand.
blackladies,3djni8,backgammon_no,8,Fri Jul 17 06:01:24 2015 UTC,advertising on a racist hatesub should hurt their brand
blackladies,3djni8,grambleflamble,7,Fri Jul 17 06:09:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, it should hurt those brands, and it would, if people knew about it.   But here's the other thing - /u/spez has said that his plan is to continue the hate subs existence, but to limit their abilities to reach the front page (so that they don't get as much attention from the majority of the population). He also wants to be able to ""claim"" that they don't profit off of the hate subs.   Which is to say - That they want to be able to claim that since these subs don't hit the front page, the profits they make from the hate subs are negligible, compared to the rest of the site, which is something they can probably already claim. They still want to be able to profit off the hate subs, just like all the other subs, but they want to have the option of saying ""well, we don't really profit off of them, they only make enough to break even"".  And since they'll still be profiting off of the hate subs, they avoid the questions like ""Wait, so you're hosting these hate subreddits for FREE, without advertising?? You're essentially penalizing all the LEGITIMATE subreddits, and you're giving the hate subs a free pass to spread their propaganda on your site without any kind of repercussions at all?""  Seriously, having the hate subs on reddit is a lose-lose situation for Reddit. I don't get how he doesn't see this.  But he's in a bit of a pickle, since a majority of this site's users are misogynistic gamers and white supremacists. If he bans them, he loses ALL profitability for this website."

Silly me.   /u/spez, this is cowardly. allowing them to stay on this site is literally endorsing racism and encouraging hatred. The only reason I can think of that you guys would let them stay is you're afraid of what they'll do to you, personally via doxxing and stalking, if you ban them. I mean, we've seen how ""your people""  react when you ban subs about fat hate, so I can only imagine how a group of organized, violent, and well-connected white supremacists would respond.   But hey, I'm sure this won't cause a rise in their membership at all, since you now have to be a member and subbed. I'm sure that won't make them feel as if they've won. Oh, and now they don't have to look at ads, either? That's supposed to be a punishment? You now host them for free. Okay.   Man ..."

blackladies,3djni8,Mur-cie-lago,47,Thu Jul 16 22:12:15 2015 UTC,"It is so easy to label something as simply being ""offensive"", and not important enough to warrant serious action when you're not the individual on the receiving end of it. Are they really so obtuse that they can't see that providing a platform form thousands of people to discuss their IRRATIONAL hatred of us is actually potentially dangerous? These people really don't give a fuck about us, do they.   I'm actually so over this site."
blackladies,3djni8,catofnortherndarknes,19,Thu Jul 16 22:07:39 2015 UTC,"Truth be told, I wouldn't care that they existed if they could be kept out of here and out of our mods' hair, but all of this makes me think, if folks knew in 1933 what they know now about Joseph Goebbels, and could do anything about it, would they have championed ""free speech"" then?  Propaganda has a HUGE effect, and your general individual tends to think they're a lot more immune to it than they are.  Now, I'm sure I'm guilty of some Godwin's Law-related offense, but I don't mean to be dramatic.  This stuff actually does shape communities and influence ideas, and that's exactly what this type wants.  Sure, they could argue that all speech does that, even that of ""social justice warriors"", but, well, then they can't really complain except to state that the very thing they are guilty of, they resent in others.  It's all ideological war in the end."
blackladies,3djni8,Mur-cie-lago,13,Thu Jul 16 21:14:11 2015 UTC,Fucking weak. They're subsidizing what is probably the largest forum for white supremacists. The kind of shithole where people like the Charleston murderer learn and teach each other. Fucking weak.

Because there is totally no relation between the two in the context of American history and black people. When it comes to anti-blackness, they remove all nuance and context that they afford whites. I 'predicted' the same move yesterday when someone was prematurely celebrating the announcement in /r/blackfellas.   It's all manufactured drama, I'll be quite surprised if there is any real change affecting the status of hate subs on Reddit.

The whole intro post is a take on places like the hate subs who give a pretty transparent wink and nod to harassment and yet avoid getting ban hammered time and time again. I strongly dislike spez but even I don't want to see him swatted for example. One other things is it keeps the subs out of the hands of places like CT and KiA which means they can't using it as a legit launching platform for harassment like the other admin hate subs

My mom is a christian but since she is Nigerian they did a stop and search in the airplane on her and nobody else. It didn't help that she had her head scarf on was speaking in tongues praying on the plane. They ain't ish!

Just... fucking no. Literally part of the definition of modern racism is a sense that racism is ""in the past.""  Honestly, it's because people are fucking arrogant and overt racism is (mostly) stigmatized int he US, so white people get up in arms if they feel like someone is defaming their character by calling them a racist. Most people still feel like racism is only if you call someone the n-word or openly segregate or hurt people from other races. They don't realize there is a thing called implicit prejudice, where we still often automatically associate Black people and Black culture with negative concepts. this implicit prejudice leaks into behaviors, thoughts, and emotions, like when you assume a customer who is a Black man is more likely to steal than an old White lady. But because changing implicit associations is hard, no one really wants to make the effort to do it themselves or help others do it."

Fat acceptance is about repeating untrue and unscientific tropes until they feel real. And that's what fatlogic skewers. It also skewers unscientific diets.  Some posts currently on the front page:   Fat burning pills don't work The widely cited study that weight loss is impossible (which has been refuted multiple times) is not true - there are 3 posts on this.

blackladies,3djjib,IrbyTremor,4,Thu Jul 16 20:32:45 2015 UTC,"""It's not a forever pass""   That's a great point. It reminds me of this other quote from an article I read the other day about cultural appropriation vs. exchange: https://unsettlingamerica.wordpress.com/2013/10/13/whats-the-difference-between-cultural-exchange-and-cultural-appropriation/  ""Don’t overstay your welcome.

Some think anyone who isn't black shouldn't wear those styles and some don't have a problem with it.  I personally, don't really care if a non-black person wears cornrows or dreadlocks. Correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't the issue Kylie using the hashtag #whitegirlsdoitbetter? I read that the original caption for that picture was that hashtag but then she changed it to something else."
blackladies,3djjib,brucelee-royjenkins,5,Thu Jul 16 20:50:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure. The article that's been passed around the most by my PoC friends http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/facts-kylie-jenner-cultural-appropriation/?tw=dd suggests that Kylie just captioned her image with ""I woke up like dis"", and it was Amandla who used the hashtag #whitegirlsdoitbetter, so I initially read it as Amandla saying white girls need to do it better. Maybe there's some other context of Kylie using the hashtag earlier, idk I don't really follow pop culture that much"
blackladies,3djjib,viversemrumo,3,Thu Jul 16 20:59:31 2015 UTC,Kylie Jenner originally uploaded that picture with the hashtag #whitegirlsdoitbetter. Amandla Stenberg replied to that tweet and also used that hashtag. Jenner edited the tweet with the hashtag you mentioned.

Neither of us are like drop dead gorgeous and my partner looks a bit like Shaggy from Scooby Doo at times, however I fell for him because of how kind he is to people. I have fallen even harder for him by how he has come with me to work events so that I don't push myself so hard and end up getting very ill (again, ive thrown out my back and ive had a horrible case of bronchitis) even my boss comments on what a good man he is. He knows how much I love my job(art teacher) and so he does things that he can to help make things easier on me.   I'ma just be real, I have always been rather perverted but very reserved cause I don't meet too many people who are cool with that. I can have a conversation about things that are both vanilla and not whilst being respected nor expected to be sexual unless its my choice.   Being different races has been difficult because of being woke as fuck, but I can talk to him about things, hell when the Charleston shooting happened I came to meet him at work and even his coworkers were woke (his work place is not diverse...) I went from a very emotionally and verbally abusive relationship, as well as emotionally and verbally abusive parents that I care for, to winning the fucking relationship lottery. Like sometimes I feel bad for like praising this boy but god damn am I grateful to have someone who is 100% in my corner and who listens and wants me to be the best woman I can be. Its gotten to the point that I even need to step up my game in being a better partner to him than he is to me. >.> so sorry ill go be giddy in my corner now.

I love seeing them together and I've known them since I was in high school, they such a beautiful black couple and their success is due to how much they and their families have supported them wholeheartedly.   Another family friend of my dads used to own a Jamaican/Lebanese restaurant but they were in a out of the way strip mall so they did not last long. But they both supported each other and their dreams. I loved visiting my aunty (y'all know them aunties that not blood related but still) and granny, It always gives me such life being around Jamaican women.    Most of the Jamaican women I had in my life were with their partners but it was never like 100% love and support which was cool and all but I think they would have been even more boss if their partners had supported them more."

I wonder what I look like. Probably like some stereotype or some Black celebrity. The amount of White folks who have told me that I look like Beyonce, Janet Jackson, Rihanna, Kerry Washington, or some other famous popular Black female celebrity is insane. I look NOTHING like any of them!  My mom is very dark and it's these kinds of people who would ask her if my sister and I were her kids. On the opposite side, my dad is very light when he doesn't get his usual tan and these kinds of people use to ask him if my other sister was his kid because she's dark like my mom.

Non-Fact: This was in Texas, the most rational state ever!  Hmmm why would a woman who was arrested illegally with a new job offer from out of town, commit suicide? Seems to me that this suicide was definitely assisted by some *cough cough officers.   Her family and friends know dang well this is a cover up.

And this is not to imply that her death is in anyway more meaningful or sadder than any other victim of police brutality, but white folks are always so quick to argue respectability, but in Sandra Bland's case, she was a university graduate, newly employed, no notable encounters with law enforcement prior to this one, she was involved with her community. She still ended up dead. So who among is safe? She could have easily been a friend of mine, or a cousin, or a sister. It is just incredibly scary to think about.

I ~actually~ made an assumption on the flag, bc it doesn't see quite right, but I can't figure any other flag that looks similar, so I'm assuming it's the flag for the land of my family (check out our food).

Everytime we come up with something positive about ourselves, certain white people want to try and hijack it. Then claim they're not racist and are just enjoying their culture. Funny. I never see it happen in the reverse. White people who do this, I just have one question; why don't y'all only want to celebrate your culture when black people are celebrating theirs? Y'all should take a page out of the Latino/Asian/other minority groups who created their own tags appropriately."

These meme are literally black folks poking fun at black experience and yet white people get offended because they feel like they weren't involved.

As a white guy who grew up in white dominated society, I can't think of a single thing that would make sense to stick a ""growing up white"" hashtag on. It's just growing up."
blackladies,3df3yc,Ih8Hondas,20,Wed Jul 15 23:12:34 2015 UTC,"Well, technically, growing up Black is also 'just growing up'. You see the inherent issue there? What you're saying is that growing up as a white person having experiences is ""normal"" whereas growing up as a Black person having experiences is ""different."" But to us, growing up Black is normal and growing up white is what's different, so by that standard, a ""growing up white"" hashtag is perfectly valid.  But in this case, they just did it to be entitled assholes. So screw 'em."
blackladies,3df3yc,eroverton,8,Fri Jul 17 10:49:51 2015 UTC,"True, but when you take the majority/minority thing into account, they become very different.  As a white American male, the society I live in is built to suit me (as I'm sure you know). To make my life easy and drama free. Or maybe I just had a really boring childhood. I don't know. There was nothing that happened to make me feel ""united"" with other white people if you will. And isn't that the purpose of the growing up black hashtag? To share experiences that most black people will recognize as unique to their upbringing in a white dominated society?  I honest to god, can't think of a single legitimate thing to follow with a ""growing up white"" hashtag."
blackladies,3df3yc,RhombusBlue,14,Thu Jul 16 00:07:06 2015 UTC,"That's true, you can't recognize shared experiences because they seem to you to be universally shared. We've been forced to share your experiences because they were ""society's experiences"" but you had no reason to share ours. However, in the larger global context, the childhood of the white (American) child is unique and strange and amusing. You just don't recognize that because you've never had to contrast yourselves with anyone else's reality. Your (white people's) reality was the reality and everyone elses's was peripheral. It's... euromericancentric! :D  (shut up, that's a word)"

Growing up White is a thing, White people just aren't forced to think of themselves as others, so they have to do a bit of work to get it.   I was just talking to a 17 y/o White guy the other day about music and how cool he thought it was that I played piano because all his friends played guitar. That was one of those ""Oh...you're a White dude"" moments...stuff like guitar-ubiquity stretches across region/class."

I walked away from the thread  more in love with being Black  Cent 2- The ones that tried to put authentically ""white"" culture in #GrowingUpWhite bored the hell out of me. Serious womp, womp  Cent 3- We surely must be more magical and powerful than we realize because the mere presence of anything Black, let alone POSITIVE Black, scares the hell out of White people.

Edit: I'm noticing they demand it more lately...I think they know we're generally kinda done giving it.

If they do that, then we're on totally different pages.   I don't hate white people, I just don't deal with them like that or expect anything from what they've shown me.

blackladies,3dctp5,tsunade202,17,Wed Jul 15 07:08:31 2015 UTC,"Sure, give the trolls a badge of honour. What could go wrong?"
blackladies,3dctp5,alexyeahdude,29,Wed Jul 15 12:38:41 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't they just make an alt for ""regular posts"" and use another for the hate subs??   I mean, isn't that a hate group tradition?? to wear hoods and hide like the cowards they are?"
blackladies,3dctp5,garnetsquarefro,9,Wed Jul 15 14:33:10 2015 UTC,That was my thought exactly - there is very little stopping someone from simply making a new account to hide their hate activity and still access popular subs.
blackladies,3dctp5,Redkiteflying,4,Wed Jul 15 14:42:02 2015 UTC,"Even outright banning them has the same issue.  Since all it takes to make a reddit account is to make a username and password, every single one of them can simply create new accounts after the ban.  Unless they ban IP's, and well, not everyone has static IP, so that banned IP can get assigned later to a innocent account, if they live in the same area and are pulling from the same ISP.  I hate to say it, but I actually don't think any of these solutions is going to work unless they, at the very least, begin requiring email validation for each created account (perhaps even text message validation).  It would have to be the end of throw-aways.  There is literally no other way to actually make sure they leave the site, unless they leave of their own accord.  In the suggested solution, they will just use alt-accounts that aren't associated with their behavior, and if they're outright banned?  They'll do the same thing, make new accounts.  Previously, I've argued they probably won't leave, because their entire purpose is to garner page views through pushing things to the general frontpage.  When they leave for another site, they're leaving one of the biggest audiences on the internet behind.  Do people really think they will give up that audience so easily?  Even if they do leave for other forums, expect harrassive behavior to happen to reddit anyway (unless those advanced mod tools come soon).  Sadly, the only way to really change is to remove the anonymity each user has, tying each one of us to a specific ""reddit identity,"" which could end up being a net negative for the people who aren't sacks of shit, because anonymity has benefits, even for us."
blackladies,3dctp5,deadaluspark,4,Wed Jul 15 15:49:29 2015 UTC,"Sadly, the only way to really change is to remove the anonymity each user has, tying each one of us to a specific ""reddit identity,"" which could end up being a net negative for the people who aren't sacks of shit, because anonymity has benefits, even for us.   This is a very good point. I would stand by everything I say and post on reddit, but at the same time, I wouldn't feel comfortable not being anonymous on this forum. I have a friend who is a teacher and she uses reddit. She'd probably have to stop using it if reddit stopped being anonymous - not because she acts differently here than she does in real life, but because she tries to minimize her online presence in general because of her job.   I feel like the author's heart is in the right place, but I doubt a dedicated ""hate"" flair would do anything for users."
blackladies,3dctp5,Redkiteflying,7,Wed Jul 15 16:41:02 2015 UTC,"How about we just get rid of the hate subs?  I mean, yeah, it'd be a fairly constant effort keeping them banned, you'd need an employee or two devoted to the task full time, but eventually they'd get the hint and migrate to voat or 8chan or stormfront or wherever and that, just by itself, would fix a lot of the problems.  Because, despite all the BS from some of the admins about keeping the hate people ""quarantined"" they don't stick to their own subs and they influence the discussion on the rest of the site.  Not to mention, of course, the bizarre attitude reflected in the quarantine comment that somehow reddit is better keeping them around than just getting rid of them.  Because right now we've got a really unpleasant situation where not only do they recruit and not only do they spread their shit in other subreddits, but by their voting they influence content sitewide.  Reddit doesn't need to have a space for the racists and neonazis and others like that."
blackladies,3dctp5,sotonohito,2,Wed Jul 15 12:58:20 2015 UTC,It looks like that might happen  anyway!
blackladies,3dctp5,supcaci,2,Wed Jul 15 16:23:07 2015 UTC,"despite all the BS from some of the admins about keeping the hate people ""quarantined"" they don't stick to their own subs and they influence the discussion on the rest of the site.   I view this another way. If those racists and neonazis don't have a single place where they can express their hate are they more likely to simply spread around to the default subs and make them worse? For all the talk about Voat or Stormfront the reason people enjoy Reddit is because they've refined the experience from a UX perspective in a way that those alternate sites haven't just yet. I don't think banning the subs causes them to run away to less enjoyable sites, on the contrary I think it will mobilize them to do everything they can to make Reddit unbearable for the rest of us. Not saying they definitely shouldn't be banned but just that it's not as black and white as some are thinking."
blackladies,3dctp5,SpotLightGuy,3,Wed Jul 15 17:36:31 2015 UTC,"Eh, history shows that they will move, or at least many will.  Look at the migration of the gamergaters from 4chan to 8chan and reddit for example.  M oreover, if they don't have a lace to congregate they can't effectively brigade and even if they stick around their influence is reduced significantly.  But most important, I think a reddit that doesn't have an official racist space is better than one that does."
blackladies,3dctp5,sotonohito,2,Wed Jul 15 19:09:39 2015 UTC,"Maybe Reddit's UX was innovative when it first started, but it doesn't take much to recreate now. They offer their source code for free, even."
blackladies,3dctp5,wannaridebikes,2,Wed Jul 15 17:52:34 2015 UTC,True. It'll be interesting to see if anyone can take that source code and actually create a real all-around challenger.

Then banning them would be much easier
blackladies,3dctp5,eroverton,12,Wed Jul 15 09:08:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know who would be in charge of those flairs, but the general Reddit hivemind equivocates the Black Panthers with the KKK (without really understanding the history of either), regularly calling people racists for calling out systemic racism even in the more ""intellectual"" subs.

blackladies,3dctp5,KhaleesiBubblegum,6,Wed Jul 15 09:54:35 2015 UTC,"This is my major issue with this (along with the difficulty of making it work). We've all heard them claim that /r/Blackladies is ""omg totes racist"" for talking about racism, and me, I moderate /r/BlackPower, which, though it focuses on positive things that Black people do, is often confused with being the same concept as white power. People come into the sub expecting hate (and pre-reacting to invisible hate) so much that I had to write a book in the sidebar explaining the difference. I have no desire to walk around with some tag because people's comprehension skills are not up to par."

The very interesting thing he wrote back was ""back when I was running things, if there was anything racist, sexist, or homophobic I'd ban it right away. I don't think there's a place for such things on reddit. Of course, now that reddit is much bigger, I understand if maybe things are different.""  I've always remembered that email when I read the occasional posting here where people say ""the founders of reddit intended this to be a place for free speech."" Human minds love originalism, e.g. ""we're in trouble, so surely if we go back to the original intentions, we can make things good again.""

Here's the only thing you're missing:  It travels upstream, except when it comes from the CEO's boss.  Alexis wasn't some employee reporting to Pao, he was the Executive Chairman of the Board, i.e. Pao's boss. He had different ideas for AMAs, he didn't like Victoria's role, and decided to fire her. Pao wasn't able to do anything about it. In this case it shouldn't have traveled upstream to her, it came from above her.  Then when the hate-train started up against Pao, Alexis should have been out front and center saying very clearly ""Ellen Pao did not make this decision, I did."" Instead, he just sat back and let her take the heat. That's a stunning lack of leadership and an incredibly shitty thing to do.  I actually asked that he be on the board when I joined; I used to respect Alexis Ohanian. After this, not quite so much.

blackladies,3d9c3f,Brer_Wolf,5,Tue Jul 14 23:02:54 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, ladies.  In the main Bernie sub, I constantly see messages about him needing to reach out more to minorities.  While I understand the need for him to reach more Latinos, I seem to see a lot of support for him here in this sub.  Now, since I'm a clueless white dude, my question is:  is the support for him in this sub indicative of the wider black community in the US?  I'm in a majority white city, so it's pretty hard for me to gauge, just by looking at this sub.  What's your take, ladies?  Does Bernie Sanders need to reach out more to the black community like the main sub thinks he does?  It's just odd for me to see people saying that he needs to reach out, then coming here and seeing so much support."
blackladies,3d9c3f,deadaluspark,13,Wed Jul 15 00:12:57 2015 UTC,"Now, since I'm a clueless white dude, my question is:  is the support for him in this sub indicative of the wider black community in the US?  I'm in a majority white city, so it's pretty hard for me to gauge, just by looking at this sub.    Maybe, maybe not. Personally, i believe everyone I know is voting for Bernie. In my experience the only people not voting for the Bern are the ones who have never heard of him and are voting for Hillary.   Even with that, I don't think r/blackladies is large enough to be indicative of black support of Bernie. Though IMO I think that having subs like ours endorsing him must show that he's really worth his salt. I think he does still need to reach out to black voters because he's got the track record to prove that he's up for the presidency."
blackladies,3d9c3f,mangaloree,5,Wed Jul 15 00:31:20 2015 UTC,I think he does still need to reach out to black voters   It will be his down fall if he doesn't. He doesn't understand that people equate = Hillary with Bill. And many people who vote don't even understand why Hillary/Bill wouldn't be a good vote. These many people are usually the older voters who vote on who they know. And a lot of older Black people love the Clintons. So it will be hard to win them over if he doesn't start now.   Older people vote the most across the races.
blackladies,3d9c3f,lovelyone20,5,Wed Jul 15 02:24:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed, he needs exposure and support from the actual voting public, either through the older populous or by getting young people excited.  I just volunteered for Bernie, and while I am white and the majority in my area is Latino, I am hoping I can at least make people aware of him as a candidate. He's got a lot to offer and suuuuuch low visibility comparatively (with Hillary Clinton)."
blackladies,3d9c3f,illuminatedbishop,3,Wed Jul 15 05:47:31 2015 UTC,make people aware of him as a candidate.    If you have a Latino friend that agree's with him ask him/her to come a long. I really don't hear too much fuss about Bernie where I'm from. So most likely the older votes will go to Hillary.
blackladies,3d9c3f,lovelyone20,4,Wed Jul 15 11:20:07 2015 UTC,"I really think the larger black communities in this country barely know of Bernie Sanders so that's why more outreach is needed (and likely for other minority communities as well).  This sub leans more left than most black Americans overall and we seem to be more socially/politically savvy/aware so that's why there's a lot of support for him.  Honestly, those I personally know choose to opt out of being informed or they're siding with Clinton and I'm sure it's largely because they don't know about Sanders.  So I am hesitant to say if this sub is a good representative of black Americans.  Perhaps those left-leaning and politically involved (which is a pretty tiny segment unfortunately) only."

The only time I had a good experience with my classmates was in a group project where the group members were very diverse...only one white guy and half the members were female. The other times when this didn't happen...talk about being invisible.
blackladies,3d94ov,Actipissed,8,Tue Jul 14 16:23:14 2015 UTC,"It's like that at any company where Whites are the majority. I found myself in a situation like hers at the previous company I worked for.   When things like this happen, I think more of us should work to start our own companies and teach more people who look like them how to do the skills they do as well as hire them."
blackladies,3d94ov,meadeater2014,2,Tue Jul 14 17:28:56 2015 UTC,I'm working in this.
blackladies,3d94ov,galaxystardust,2,Sat Jul 18 13:28:25 2015 UTC,"I came across this on Twitter. (Evidently it was a Black woman in tech who posted the link) To be honest I'm not that knowledgeable about the tech industry but I do know it's tremendously racist.  So hearing Angelica's terrible experience made me upset, but not surprised. (Dropbox can suck it)"
blackladies,3d94ov,thestillnessinmyeyes,8,Tue Jul 14 13:55:13 2015 UTC,"I am looking at three pages of tech department in my company directory, not even counting trainers and supporting tech related departments. There are three PoC in the tech dept. One in each office. Of over 40+ people, one Chinese man, one Dominican man, and myself, one black Puerto Rican woman. The rest are all white.  We do have a fair share of women though, we used to be about 60/40 women but now we're about 50/50."
blackladies,3d94ov,thestillnessinmyeyes,4,Tue Jul 14 14:48:09 2015 UTC,"That's really cool that there is a decent amount of women working in your tech department. (The amount of WOC on the other hand...) How is the work environment, if you don't mind me asking?"
blackladies,3d94ov,ZiggyPepper,6,Tue Jul 14 16:25:28 2015 UTC,"I'm in legal; overall, pretty good in my office. I know some of the other offices have had issues with end users abusing the tech staff but here in mine, everyone is relatively chill.   The part that sucks is kind of that I KNOW people tune my ass out because I'm a woman. Like, users will come up to me and ask me to format their documents, file their email, and other secretarial assignments, because they see no difference between me and the women secretaries.  I even had one guy try to get me to fill out his visa paperwork for him. It's the equivalent of someone coming up to you and asking you to make the coffee because you're a woman.   Within the dept though, it's fine. I only work with them all remotely but they're all very nice and I've never even so much as had to side-eye anyone in my dept., they're all very mid-western friendly and I never hear anyone say anything remotely sexist or racist. But, it's also a law firm, a large one at that, that standard for professionalism is relatively high and the only exceptions made in that way are for high profit shareholders that bring in a disproportionate amount of money with their client sets."
blackladies,3d94ov,Mangalaiii,4,Tue Jul 14 16:46:14 2015 UTC,This scares me a lot....I'm majoring in CS and hearing stuff like this makes me nervous and fearful about my success in the future.
blackladies,3d77h4,lovelyone20,19,Tue Jul 14 01:38:21 2015 UTC,Can someone explain this post to me? I at least want to try to be hip.
blackladies,3d77h4,Patsson77,21,Tue Jul 14 04:54:52 2015 UTC,"Okay, a bit deeper.  Kylie Jenner is a member of a family who got wealthy from their proximity to black culture, starting with Kim's sex tape with a Ray J (the brother of pop star Brandy).  Most are half-Armenian, which is technically a Middle Eastern extraction and funnily enough, actually accurate to categorize as caucasian since Armenia is actually located in the caucasus region.    Yes, actual caucasians are dark-skinned ""white people"".  Anyway, that entire family continues to build their brand from their proximity and appropriation of black culture. Everything from Kim's marriage and cosmetically enhanced derriere to the rest of the girls' dating preferences and continued styling like black women.   Amandla responded to a poster on Kylie's instagram post, one in which Kylie is styled like a black woman.  Fake tan, cornrowed hair...  Laying out why Kylie is appropriating.  She didn't even call this women out of her name.  Also, Amandla is sixteen.  Kylie is nineteen seventeen.  So, this grown-ass man and trans woman are laughing at a sixteen year old black girl for doing what they would do if anyone had to the nerve to appropriate  gay culture and profit from it, while demonstrating zero concern for actual oppression.  Ironically, the ONLY Jenner/Kardashian who has spoken out about any of the shit black people get is Caitlyn.  The conservative, who actually talked about her privilege as a wealthy person to be able to get the surgeries and support vs. black trans women who are disproportionately abused, assaulted, and murdered during her interview with Diane Sawyer (that surprised me).  Meanwhile, all of the girls were texting during the #BlackLivesMatter segment at the MTV awards.  So, if anyone is a jackhole, it's Kylie.  Wearing cornrows and fucking creepy old black men does not make you black."
blackladies,3d77h4,garnetsquarefro,13,Tue Jul 14 12:59:18 2015 UTC,"On point wrap up except that the Kardashians' original proximity to the black community stems from the deceased patriarch's involvement in the OJ Simpson case. and Kylie is 17, not 19."

blackladies,3d77h4,leftblane,3,Tue Jul 14 17:58:08 2015 UTC,I don't know! It seems pretty obvious now that I think about it. I don't really like or dislike the Kardashians so I guess it just never crossed my mind.
blackladies,3d77h4,KosherDill,7,Tue Jul 14 18:48:17 2015 UTC,"If you look for photos of Kim pre-2007, her bottom is much smaller and more proportioned to her body in comparison to now. Her face is different too and I'm pretty sure she added breast implants at some point. Khloe has admitted to getting her butt done in 2014. Kourtney has admitted to breast implants."
blackladies,3d77h4,leftblane,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:02:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she's publicly acknowledged the breast implants. But no comment on the butt and she says her new face is the work of talented make-up artists...   ETA: she = Kim."
blackladies,3d77h4,coco5715,2,Wed Jul 15 01:29:48 2015 UTC,"Fuck it, she was honestly just making an offhand remark to my friend November (who was tagged in the original post)  Homegirl didn't expect that comment to blow up like it did, tbh."
blackladies,3d77h4,Introdictus,2,Wed Jul 15 10:31:33 2015 UTC,"Not defending the Kardashian's and their constant appropriation of black culture here, but I remember an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians where they visited Italy. Kim and Kris attended a banquet or something like that and a man showed up in full blackface. I'm not sure if she outright said that it was racist, but Kim was very clearly upset about it. And there was another instance where they were being interviewed along with some comedian and he said ""we're still waiting for 'Niggas in Vienna' "" (a joke on Kanye's ""Niggas in Paris"") and both Kim and Kris were shocked. Maybe this was a recent episode I'm not sure because I don't watch KUWTK like that, but I'm hoping that this was evidence of the Kardashian family getting more ""woke"" and instead of using black people and our culture as an accessory to their lavish lifestyle, they use their influence to educate their fans on what racism really is."
blackladies,3d77h4,summerallya,6,Tue Jul 14 21:23:44 2015 UTC,"but I'm hoping that this was evidence of the Kardashian family getting more ""woke""    LMBO, that's a cute thought. I don't have any strong feelings for the Kardashians but believe me they really don't care that much about Black people for them to change."
blackladies,3d77h4,garnetsquarefro,2,Tue Jul 14 22:39:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is typical white liberal ""OMG the starving African kids"" level of empathy, which is nil.    They kinda' vaguely feel something, but nothing to increase their knowledge of the shit that's happening all around them, especially if it's ""exhausting"" for them to consider their part in it."
blackladies,3d77h4,badkarmabum,3,Wed Jul 15 15:54:05 2015 UTC,"Seeing as how instead of siding with Amandla for taking issue that someone hashtagged the photo whitegirlsdoitbetter she went after her, I don't see Jenner ever being woke."
blackladies,3d77h4,thesyntaxofthings,8,Wed Jul 15 13:17:20 2015 UTC,"Amandla Stenberg posted a comment on Kylie Jenner's instagram post, in which Kylie had cornrows in her hair accusing her of appropriation. Andy Cohen called her ""jackhole of the day"" on tv, Andre Leon Talley and Laverne Cox did not defend Amandla"
blackladies,3d77h4,bakerowl,27,Tue Jul 14 10:14:55 2015 UTC,"I can get really over protective of children especially Black children. And Amandla is a bright young woman and I don't here too many adult speak as well she does. I'm just taken aback as these two Black adults say nothing to defend this young lady.   Laverne is getting the extra side from me, since this is the second thing she's done that was questionable. People don't have to perfect, but please don't allow people to disrespect young Black children in your presence, and on national tv.  Edit: My mistake, she later distance herself from this problematic inmate. I did know this at the time. My bad."
blackladies,3d77h4,theworldisbullshit,4,Tue Jul 14 01:42:43 2015 UTC,What other problematic thing did Laverne Cox do?
blackladies,3d77h4,RhombusBlue,14,Tue Jul 14 02:34:12 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I remember her supporting some transwoman who raped and murdered a 13 year old black girl. She released a statement after saying that she wasn't aware of the crime she committed but it still makes me side eye her. How can she throw her support behind a campaign for somebody without checking the facts?  http://www.buzzfeed.com/skarlan/laverne-cox-reads-a-letter-from-a-transwoman-currently-in-pr#.fkJnPXQAW"
blackladies,3d77h4,as_a_black_woman,15,Tue Jul 14 03:29:55 2015 UTC,Just saw that Laverne Cox said on Twitter that she didn't know Amandla pre-Sunday.   Um...I dunno...you still knew Kylie Jenner and appropriation.
blackladies,3d77h4,KevlarSweetheart,6,Tue Jul 14 16:33:05 2015 UTC,"Ugh, this is sickening. I hope someone comes for them, for real.  Edit: someone, not sunbathe, lmao"
blackladies,3d77h4,RaHxRaH,20,Tue Jul 14 03:52:03 2015 UTC,This is very unPC but I'm just going to say it. I think there is sometimes an insidious mentality of gay men in general toward black women. And the intersectionality of sexism and racism is never more apparent then when it comes to the disconnect between those two communities.  I've never liked Laverne Cox and I don't consider her an ally of black women. This is clear by her consenting and tacit allowance of this verbal abuse of a 16 year old black girl.
blackladies,3d77h4,RhombusBlue,29,Tue Jul 14 02:12:10 2015 UTC,"Can you elaborate on why you dislike Laverne? Why don't you consider her an advocate of black women?  Also, I have a sneaking suspicion that Laverne and André didn't challenge what Andy said partly because he is gay. It seems like people give gay men a bit of a pass when it comes to problematic attitudes towards black women."
blackladies,3d77h4,garnetsquarefro,7,Tue Jul 14 03:05:13 2015 UTC,"That similar to what I was thinking.   Precious few will call a White man of power (gay, straight, or otherwise) out on his BS unless they are directly threatened themselves."
blackladies,3d77h4,ObsidianBlackbirdMcN,12,Tue Jul 14 13:39:09 2015 UTC,"Laverne Cox IS a black woman.  I have a real issue with you categorizing her as part of the ""insidious mentality of  gay men""."
blackladies,3d77h4,KevlarSweetheart,20,Tue Jul 14 12:40:30 2015 UTC,"Just because she's one of us doesn't mean she's here for us-- just look at Whoopi and Stacey Dash. Laverne Cox's most prominent political allegiance is to the LGBT community-- a community whose public face is dominated by white gay men like Andy Cohen. I think this incident alone is evidence that she can operate under the ""insidious mentality"" that OP described."
blackladies,3d77h4,RaHxRaH,11,Tue Jul 14 14:35:11 2015 UTC,This is where I'm getting at. Just because someone is a black woman or even just black-that does not mean they have our best interest.  I think Laverne is an opportunist.
blackladies,3d77h4,Honeychile6841,2,Tue Jul 14 16:13:52 2015 UTC,"She should have used the word advocate in this case, though. How can you say a black woman isn't an ally of black women? Doesn't ally means a supportive outsider? Since Laverne is trans, the post comes off as transphobic. The wording seems to be treating her like a gay man."
blackladies,3d77h4,RaHxRaH,2,Tue Jul 14 15:59:45 2015 UTC,I have to agree.  I get what OP is saying in defending Amanda ( sorry if I got her name wrong) but the subtle shade on the trans community stung a bit.

The family could then sue to enforce the settlement agreement."

And only those who are loud and ignorant about the evils of affirmative action will find this surprising when it has always been the case.  People like her always claim that undeserving minorities took her spot. No, underperforming White folks took your spot. This has always been the case and always will be. As soon as affirmative action is no more, underperforming White chicks will miss out on opportunities they think they deserve, but never deserved in the first place. Then, the new narrative will be that sexism is keeping them down along with minorities who are actually out-performing them."

And that whole comment about Tyler Perry made me think about things. I know some people may not like his work, but I don't go out of my way to speak negatively about him. He's done a lot of good and even though I may not agree with certain aspects of his story telling, he's brought a lot of jobs for AA actors.   I notice that some Black people go out of their way to make disparaging remarks about certain Black artist especially in front of non-Blacks/Blacks. And that, ""Makes me feel some type of way""."

I 100% acknowledge and 100% lambast colorism in casting or anything else, but I'm not sure what the real world solution is for fairer actors and actresses if in every role, there is the roar of ""it's your fault dark women don't get representation!"" Is she just supposed to say ""Thank you, I could use the work, and I like the project, but please, give this work to someone else, I'll just sit here and do nothing in my field, I don't want to perpetuate colorism by existing.""   Wouldn't that ire be better directed at directors and casting agents and producers rather than the actors themselves?"
blackladies,3d4mrr,thestillnessinmyeyes,3,Tue Jul 14 13:11:24 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't that ire be better directed at directors and casting agents and producers rather than the actors themselves?   I'm saying people like Kravitz should also be directing that ire  to directors and casting agents (it's more effective that way like it was against slavery by white abolitionists), and not just complaining about racism when it doesn't work in their favour (in white institutions). And all the while keeping mum about the treatment black women get in our own media as in the case of Dope. Obviously, racism is inextricably linked with capitalism and fairer skinned black women and everybody is supposed to work somehow under this system. Yet if no one is ready to forgo any of their unearned privileges, there isn't any point talking about 'solving' (white) racism or colorism."
blackladies,3d4mrr,GeneralBuhari,2,Tue Jul 14 21:00:30 2015 UTC,"if no one is ready to forgo any of their unearned privileges   I'm... not sure that's how that's supposed to work. I'm not sure the answer is ""take roles given to light skinned black women away from them and give it to darker black women"" as opposed to ""open up more roles to all non-white, particularly in roles in which race is not integral to the plot.""  That'd be like 2 black people fighting over an affirmative action seat instead of fighting to not need affirmative action."
blackladies,3d4mrr,thestillnessinmyeyes,6,Wed Jul 15 12:30:12 2015 UTC,"While I realise there is an upstream problem of white supremacy in Hollywood, I don't feel that analogy adequately covers colorism (which is also quite capable of existing without racism). Race is ""integral to the plot"" here. Dope, supposedly a depiction of inner city black life, and casting Nina Simone as a light-skinned black woman shows how we maintain such hierarchies in black media. Besides that, I don't think it is equally a zero-sum game for white, or light-skinned black women compared to darker women. White people use such reasoning all the time too as justification of why a movie is white-washed (should Christian Bale and the white extras in Exodus be 'out of a job' to make space for minority actors? I don't think the answer is as important as we think). Which is what I meant that such reasoning ignores  certain unearned privileges and focuses on a potential zero-sum effect even when none might exist."

It pisses me off because he has the means to do better and move beyond these problematic story-lines and one note characters yet still choosing to make the same crappy movies.

blackladies,3d34y5,redman7t,16,Mon Jul 13 03:39:40 2015 UTC,"For me personally, I’m just about done with Reddit because of the constant racism towards all races (of course you know the race of exception) I see here. I only see this increasing as Reddit wants to become a bastion of “free speech”. I understand the concept but I don’t want to be on or supporting a site that is increasingly becoming a safe haven for white power advocates. Yes, we live in a world where there are racists but I don’t want to have to deal with them constantly in my house because they’ve set up camp on the lawn.   So I created a site using postatic.com, which I think gives about the same layout and feeling that we’re used to on Reddit. MANY features and customizations (yeah what you see, is what you get, it’s pretty plain) are missing from what Reddit has to offer but I think we could make it work at least until something better comes along if you guys want to. The major plus is that it is an isolated site, so you don’t have to deal with trash spilling in from other subreddits or brigading. If the mods here want to moderate the site as they currently do I have no problem with that (the modding tools don’t seem to be as extensive as reddit currently though).   Of course if anybody has any better alternatives or ideas, leave a comment as well. This is more of a nomination than an official pick, the community will decide."
blackladies,3d34y5,wafflebread,23,Mon Jul 13 03:40:28 2015 UTC,"This is pretty cool.  I'll be honest about one thing, though...I don't think I'd be interested in a space that didn't have the same level of care and sensitivity as the mods here. For example, I really feel like a lot of the discussion here is very safe and engaging for me as a black woman. But another major black sub I won't name feel more like the wild west where ignorance isn't ever checked. And I would definitely wouldn't want a place like this getting overtaken by ashy anhks, black redpillers, and pro-Cosby people.   You should message the mods about your new site!"
blackladies,3d34y5,wannaridebikes,6,Mon Jul 13 05:42:14 2015 UTC,"About your last clause, that's a real challenge. I would like a pro-black space to be open to all black people, and we can't pretend that all black people are on the same place on the political spectrum. We also can't pretend there aren't black people with shitty views.   I already know I would be outnumbered by Christian and Muslim users under this model.   I don't know how to balance that, really, but that can be a tough one."
blackladies,3d34y5,wafflebread,5,Mon Jul 13 17:21:11 2015 UTC,"I dunno...should it be open to ALL black people? I feel like this sub is really good about maintaining standards for what kind of content isn't allowed here. This sub is specifically safe for black ladies, and I feel like a space for all black people by its nature wouldn't be safe for black ladies. I am glad I can come here and not see opinions dominated by problematic men and the women who support them. I know that excludes a lot of black people, but it has been really helpful for me and I think a lot of other black female users that come here. :("
blackladies,3d34y5,Tyranny13,8,Mon Jul 13 22:36:45 2015 UTC,"I second this. If those of the ""ashy ankh"" variety want their own safe space, they can make their own damn websites.

blackladies,3d34y5,wannaridebikes,3,Tue Jul 14 01:41:05 2015 UTC,"It depends on what the creator of the site wants to do, of course. What you want could be accomplished with a heavily moderated section, but that would require more mod power to handle the issues in the more general section and to keep the more heavily moderated section clear.   I just get a little wary when people imply someone has to be a certain way to be apart of a community. Obviously, no sexism, racism (against black people or other poc), homophobia, transphobia, etc, but places like that tend to be hostile to people who are asking questions. Not asking questions in a trollin type of way, but genuine questions. /r/blackladies seems to be okay with this, as far as I can tell.   At least with reddit, black people with problematic opinions don't have to post here, and they have black alternative subs to some of their interests. Even then though, they are bound to come across anti-black racism if forced to participate in a more popular sub for their interests, like going to a conservative Christian sub and finding a bunch of ""race realists"".  Even the president couldn't escape racist remarks. We know even the most self-hating, white worshipping, bougiee black person will still have to deal with racism. An escape for them would be nice, too. I don't like that my mom doesn't support gay marriage, but if she wanted to join a web forum and discuss religion, it would be cool if she didn't come across Rev. Cletus and his White Knights.  And who knows, maybe some good discussion may come of it. Lord knows they have enough of their own enclaves offline. Maybe this would be the first time they heard of a black person with a different opinion than them lol."

You won't find them taught by any real philosopher (ah, no true Scotsman; just being hyperbolical).   Just because an argument contains a fallacy doesn't mean the content of the problem has been addressed (only its structure),   nor that its conclusion is false.  Pointing out why the argument is fallacious without resorting to Latin is always better."
blackladies,3d1n5i,GeneralBuhari,2,Mon Jul 13 01:12:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  I can't tell you how many times people come with talk of fallaciousness on my part but are partaking in just as many fallacies themselves.  The bottom line is:  you can't reason with the unreasonable.  Just ask Yanis Varoufakis (emphasis mine):   HL: What was it like? Did you like any aspect of it?  YV: Oh well a lot of it. But the inside information one gets… to have your worst fears confirmed … To have “the powers that be” speak to you directly, and it be as you feared – the situation was worse than you imagined! So that was fun, to have the front row seat.  HL: What are you referring to?  YV: The complete lack of any democratic scruples, on behalf of the supposed defenders of Europe’s democracy. The quite clear understanding on the other side that we are on the same page analytically – of course it will never come out at present. [And yet] To have very powerful figures look at you in the eye and say “You’re right in what you’re saying, but we’re going to crunch you anyway.”  HL: You’ve said creditors objected to you because “I try and talk economics in the Eurogroup, which nobody does.” What happened when you did?  YV: It’s not that it didn’t go down well – it’s that there was point blank refusal to engage in economic arguments. Point blank. … You put forward an argument that you’ve really worked on – to make sure it’s logically coherent – and you’re just faced with blank stares. It is as if you haven’t spoken. What you say is independent of what they say. You might as well have sung the Swedish national anthem – you’d have got the same reply. And that’s startling, for somebody who’s used to academic debate. … The other side always engages. Well there was no engagement at all. It was not even annoyance, it was as if one had not spoken.     We might not get blank stares when we present coherent arguments, we might just get more trolling, but the act is the same, it's to just roundly ignore anything that's been said because they've already made their decision, facts be damned."

blackladies,3d0jh7,blackgirldown,43,Sun Jul 12 14:13:51 2015 UTC,"You know, I'm really torn.  I applaud what this man wrote, and the decision he made.  And sometimes I think, wouldn't it be nice to be able to enjoy a community where hate speech and general ignorance wasn't welcome, or at least where people had a true option of turning the volume down on it completely (Hubski is the closest I've seen to something like this)?  With recent changes, I fear that Reddit will become a place where all of us, and not just the mods, will be forced to interface with the toxic attitudes that prevail among the most vocal Redditors.  The prevailing attitude among them seems to be ""Oh waaah, so you'll be forced to hear viewpoints you don't agree with!  Sorry you can't have your social justice warrior utopia here"", which is just as disingenuous on its face as a great deal of white supremacist culture; they have no intention to inform, debate, or exchange, or learn.  Their aim is to harass, and to create a virtual society where it's acceptable to do so.    On the other hand, part of me just rankles at the idea of ceding the floor to them.  Maybe there's an in between place.  And maybe Reddit will get just what it deserves, the community it creates:  A place where even those who may not agree with the Patrick-Bateman-Meets-Peter-Griffin tone and values of the society here but are content to stay silent, or who are indifferent as they feel it doesn't concern them (sound familiar?) will get just the lowbrow, crass, hateful experience they deserve when thoughtful, intelligent, kind, and good people leave for other environs or decrease their interaction with the greater community.  Because if we know anything about hate, we know that it's insidious."
blackladies,3d0jh7,catofnortherndarknes,7,Sun Jul 12 17:54:45 2015 UTC,This is about how i feel.
blackladies,3d0jh7,IrbyTremor,13,Sun Jul 12 21:26:35 2015 UTC,"The internet has free speech: You host your own web site, or your own forums. Choosing to run a business that hosts certain types of speech has nothing to do with making sure people have a right to speak freely: It’s inviting them to speak on your dime, and choosing to make money from their speech and their audience.   Fair point. By allowing the racists to thrive, you are providing the good but also promoting the bad and the racists are in fact giving you some revenue in ads or gold.   EDIT: Also this:   “But while the inhabitants may be different people, the landlord is the same person, and keeping the lights on in /r/javascript is also keeping the lights on in the Chimpire.”   Bonus from comments:   Like, I know some libertarian types who become apoplectic over “censorship” on various social media platforms. Why should it be a problem for them if a company decides to alter it’s policies on hate speech for it’s own benefit? If they’re bonered up on this idea of “let the market decide”, why do they shit themselves when the market decides that maybe hosting violent hate speech isn’t ultimately beneficial to a corporation’s bottom line?   I said this before, having racism on Reddit and being tied to a major band is bad PR for that brans and they can cut ties with reddit, and knowing how companies do, other companies can do the same and then reddit loses money. That isn't good business.   Damn, some more:   But it’s the free market at work and, truth be told, the racism and misogyny does quite well in this market. Black folks don’t wield a lot of power on that site. Let’s say we all leave in a huff and guess what? Most of the white folks and other POC (I’m specifically talking about Asians) on here won’t. All of our purported allies will still click on r/pics or go to some forum because that’s “different” and their homies are there. They know what’s going on just around the corner, so of course they’ll come on Gawker and slag Redditors as a bunch of neck bearded racists. And Gawker links to Reddit all the time. I know how this works, so I’mma do what works for my self-respect. Bye, Reddit."

Most of the analysis is spot one (the critiques of her success because of her physique, the veiled and not so veiled racial speech, etc)    My only nitpick about the article is about tennis being boring because Serena's so dominate. They are saying it, but they did say the same thing about Graff. This sort of thing tends to bubble up when there's a changing of the guard in the Men's side. But oddly they didn't say it about Sampras or Federer, and when Venus and Serena had their lull, the complaint suddenly became that there wasn't a dominant champion and without one Women's tennis was dying. There was no winning.  My only point is don't forget there is intersectionality at play, and some of things that Serena is facing has been faced by women's tennis in general. It's a case of understanding when her race is a primary factor, when her gender is, and finally when they both combine to be a factor."
blackladies,3d0hjf,Explosive_Diaeresis,7,Sun Jul 12 16:55:37 2015 UTC,"Besides the negative reports about Williams’s body in the Western media and the snide comments by tennis fans, some players on the tour have also resulted to ridiculing Williams’s curvaceous body. During an exhibition match between Caroline Wozniaki and Maria Sharapova, Wozniaki stuffed her bra and skirt with towels to imitate Serena’s body. In another exhibition match, Novak Djokovic did a similar thing. In contrast, when tennis players imitate other players, they imitate other aspects such as the way players hold their rackets, how they scream, adjust their clothes or hit the ball instead of focusing on their physique.  https://mediadiversityuk.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/afp-515851261-4_3.jpg?w=300&h=225   WTF Beckys?"

You even  forgive these people who don't like you when they kill you whereas we don't generally consider them as people in the first place... whether as people to hate or as people who hate us. So, it doesn't hurt us, at least the majority of people (unless it's physically speaking),  because hating us is further proof of their own inhumanity.

blackladies,3d35d7,blkrabbit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:51:40 2015 UTC,"See, this is why ""Malcolm went to Saudi Arabia and found out there were white Muslims that all loved one another regardless of race and he became totes happy"" is such a pile. The existence of Muslims of all colors was known. The Islamic ideal that ""there is no color in Islam"" was known. There's not SUPPOSED to be racism in Islam. But weeeeeee are dealing with a racist mindset - not only in America, but one that has managed to poison the entire world against Black people. Middle Eastern Muslims love to spout about how there's no racism in Islam - there shouldn't be, nor any other religion. But in practicality, there is. There always has been. Malcolm knew that ahead of time. He didn't go overseas, get some amazing clarity, and decide the NOI was racist. That's the propaganda they put out there. The NOI isn't racist, but knows we're living in a world where everyone including ourselves has been taught to hate and despise us, so we had to learn the love of ourselves.  Racism isn't absent among Muslims, regardless of what they like to claim. The book says there is no one better than another because of the color of his skin - only in how well he keeps his duty to God, but that's not what's put into practice. Minister Farrakhan said that when he was visiting the Arab countries, he saw things like... Black Muslims with PhDs were being made to serve coffee and treated like servants to Arab Muslims who weren't nearly as educated because that's the only jobs they would allow them to have."
blackladies,3d35d7,eroverton,3,Mon Jul 13 23:45:46 2015 UTC,"You don't really need to go to Arab countries to see that racist phenomenon. Northern muslims (where 'jihads' began) in Nigeria discriminate against southern ones who also, in turn,  discriminate culturally against us northerners (even though I'm nominally Christian like most of southerners). Although it's hard to separate religion from culture because they've been incorporated into each other, I'm always like none of you are 'original' to those religions (Arabs and Western Christians don't care about you) so why the differences? But the truth is they all are just using religion or culture as a proxy for actual  political or material  differences (especially land and capital). It's particularly uplifting and depressing at the same time they don't care about Arab/white supremacy... they'll even think and say they are the more authentic adherents of those religions."

blackladies,3cy1f1,IrbyTremor,14,Sat Jul 11 20:23:27 2015 UTC,"I want to take a look at this from a different angle. Predators like Cosby, Jerry Sandusky, the Pedophile Priests, etc, don't do these public works to distract people from their actions, they do it aid them. Their position of power gives them a way pass the guard of the victims and gives them a natural defense of the community they've hoodwinked. People don't come by trust easily, so when someone violates that trust, it's going to lead to some denial, why do you think it took 30, 40, 50 years for this stuff to come to light.  Here's the harsh truth about a lot of the men who are defending him, they are as big of creeps as Cosby. I had an argument with a close friends uncle about this, I went off because I couldn't believe what I was hearing. These dudes have no issue with using their power over someone as a means to get them into bed. These dudes are the same guys who'd turn to me and ""cmon bruh, man to man, in his place, you wouldn't?""  They aren't defending him specifically because they value the rapist more than the victim, they're defending him because in his place, they'd want to be the predator and they see those victims prey."
blackladies,3cy1f1,Explosive_Diaeresis,12,Sat Jul 11 23:09:30 2015 UTC,"Here's the harsh truth about a lot of the men who are defending him, they are as big of creeps as Cosby.   Thunderous applause for your entire comment but especially this.  You know how some say ""All your skin folk aint your kin folk"", well, there needs to be a version of this little ism for gender.  Misogyny/misogynoir is definitely perpetuated by women. Especially black women.   I'm cringing at the glimpse you gave me with ""man to man"". I just.....uugughghghghg my skin is crawling.  Fuck this green earth.  But yeah, they also see him as the height of the Black Patriarch image and cant stand to see it knocked down. They want to be Dr Huxtable, or they want him to be their dad and real mentor.  Its twisted from every angle. And its all on a foundation of the natural environment of hating women but feeling owed and entitled to something from us."
blackladies,3cy1f1,Explosive_Diaeresis,6,Sat Jul 11 23:14:07 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I don't blame people for wanting that or needing that. Pretty much of all of our heroes were killed,  whitewashed, plain erased from the history books, lived long enough for them to be vilified or a combination thereof. Every kid needs someone to put on a pedestal, I was lucky enough to have latched on to Thurgood Marshall, but parts of me also latched on to the characters in Cosby's work.  Personally, it was easy to dismiss the elder Cosby's words as the ramblings of an old man, and keep the good work. But not going to lie, it's a much harder pill to swallow knowing that Fat Albert, Cosby Show and a Different World were part of his grooming routine. My entire idea of going to College was based around that show. I admired the mentoring he did of the young people in his cast, and I try to emulate that in my career. But now you have to look at his motives in a different light...the pill is going down but it doesn't taste good.  Where am I going: As Black people in America, we are in a constant state of having to question the legends and myths disguised as history because they often serve tear us down. It would have been nice to have a myth, a small fairy tale. Like the odd amnesia about the 50s that White people have (engendered by shows like Leave it to Beaver), or that romanticization of the founding fathers love of independence that only went so far, and now we have to parse through Cosby's ""altruism"" and understand what it means in context, and what actual lessons to take from it. I think that's where Jill Scott and Whoopi were at. The hardest part will being doing that in a way that puts proper focus on his victims, which is probably impossible.   In the end, what you're intimating is probably what needs to happen, discard all of it and stick to reality. Life without some myths though just seems depressing."

And then someone arguing that they aren't full Taino. Who cares?! Yes, their Taino blood is extremely diluted and barely there, but that doesn't mean people should forget who their distant ancestors are. People should be happy that they kept some of their customs and traditions. Full-blooded Taino were wiped out centuries ago by Europeans.

I'm not miffed if she personally made the decision to do so, she needs to take care of her health too concerning this site and it's not my place to dump on her for that.  With her resignation, it's just giving a bro-fist to the scum of this site that they won.  And now another white dude is in charge?  LOL You know they're itching to reinstate all those hate subs now."
blackladies,3cuflo,lottikey,17,Fri Jul 10 23:17:41 2015 UTC,"I doubt it.   Back when reddit was founded, it was a very different place.   Extra-old timer here.   Believe it or not, back when reddit first came around, it was dominated by intelligent civil discussion from the adults in the professional IT world.  That is when the population was lower around here and the ""cool kids"" didn't know about the place yet.  And the comments that got the most upvotes on serious discussions weren't jokes or regurgitated memes.  Sadly, the popularity of reddit (and most social internet spaces (save Facebook which actually gets it from family usage) comes form young people.  Young people en masse are often, cruel, have very wrong ideas about world they have only read and experienced a small part of, and like gross-shock jokes.   Reddit has turned into a hodgepodge of far fewer well-thought gems mixed in with fetid jokes about body functions, pop culture references, and sex.  Basically the mind of a lonely entitled 13 year old white boy dominated the website once it became popular.  My guess is they'll use the white guy to make the same policies go down easier."

That doesn't change the rampant misogynistic and racist remarks by redditors that were made towards her in any way. They scapegoated her at every chance they got, as if she was supreme ruler of Reddit who made all of the decisions without having some board approve of what she did to begin with. All because she took their racist subs ball away."

Ever since the fiasco all I could think is, am I the only one feeling as if a lot of the hate towards her is really racist. But of course you wonderful ladies see it too.  A white woman loses her job and her white saviors swoop in to her defense. Without even knowing the reason for her departure, but of course that doesn't matter cause white is right. I was hoping Ellen would stay and give a big fuck you to reddit. I was so ready to lick up the white tears. But alas we can only have one win a today.

Let's face it, you sanctimonious jackass, you don't actually know the woman.  So while it's fair for you to say you didn't like some of what she did, you don't have the standing to say whether or not you like her.  Fuck off.

blackladies,3cuflo,Explosive_Diaeresis,10,Sat Jul 11 02:39:07 2015 UTC,"In one of the threads, someone was trying to argue that sexism and racism had nothing to do with how Pao was treated, and I responded (gist: uhhhh, yes it did). Then another commenter hit me with this:    The rape and racist comments were because of her being a woman/ whatever race she is, sure, but the hate itself wasn't sexism.   I just...I just needed someone else to see that fuckery."

It's seriously so fucked up how the media and everyone online has a hivemind to be casually racist and sexist. Ellen Pao was clearly the scapegoat and none of the White execs got any flak, but everyone was making Asian and anti-Women jokes about Pao and it was encouraged. The response from Reddit execs is disgusting - as if they weren't responsible for reddit's shittiness and came in at the last minute to save everyone.   I have no hope for the future, reddit is just a playground for entitled White douchebags."

blackladies,3cuflo,darkh0ur,12,Sat Jul 11 00:40:39 2015 UTC,"I believe it partly because I find it hard to believe that this issue—whatever it is going on behind the scenes—will be dropped after Ellen and partly because it seems like Ellen was a scapegoat. I've always believed that CEOs don't ""truly"" run a company, that the Board of Directors do.   I feel like Victoria being fired was a result of orders that came from the top. I mean really? The only chick who was the bridge between admins and mods of the AMA sub and ran the show was fired in favor of a mod/admin everyone hates? Victoria had that sub's best interest at heart and the person they put in place is the least friendly mod of all time lol.   Steve might seem like a savior in Reddit's  ""dark times"" but I hardly believe he comes with good tidings. I've said before that once Ellen steps down someone is going to have to take her place and continue on."
blackladies,3cuflo,mangaloree,11,Sat Jul 11 01:22:36 2015 UTC,"I'm going to copy and paste what I said in ghazi when someone mentioned that the board of directors is actually the ones in charge:   I'm rather cynical so I may be wrong but after her ""reasoning"" for stepping down being she would be unable to get the user growth they were asking. I could easily see the board of investors giving him full control. I could also easily see him opening the shit subs back up to get more growth and pull back the groups that did leave for voat.  I mean he obviously has no qualms with shitty subreddits if he let those and worse be around back then, and back then they were some of the largest draws to the site. When you googled reddit while he was CEO jailbait was the first result."

Growing the userbase and trying to draw back the people that left may unfortunately be the best(fiscally at least definitely not morally) way to increase the user numbers that the board is asking for.  They see the 100k people that jumped ship to voat, and the quarter million that signed the petition and might have gotten spooked that it really was the next digg exodus.   Remember, these people only give a shit about one thing, how to line their pockets. Yes they may give glib responses and act like progressives, but do you honestly think they would be willing to lose their money on a moral crusade?"

Those users are still here. Voat does not seem to be ready for prime time, not so much that they can compete with Reddit. They just can't handle the traffic.  2) Surely someone at Reddit HQ has come to the conclusion that there is more to having a successful site than having tons of users at any cost? Having those users has made Reddit toxic to most major advertisers, as evidenced by the fact that Reddit has been one of the largest websites in North America and on the web at large for years and it still isn't profitable. I'm still holding out hope that these people aren't total morons, even if their moral compasses point nowhere but south.   EDIT: I'm also kind of heartened by Pao's comment that she didn't feel confident she could meet the board's targets while holding fast to Reddit's core values (paraphrase, I'll copy & paste the actual line in a sec). If she couldn't meet their goals by banning ""behavior, not ideas,"" perhaps there is an acknowledgement at Reddit that hosting all manner of depraved content puts a limit on growth potential. If I'm Coca-Cola or Nike, I can't run the risk of my advertising running on or near a subreddit/post where people are trying to defend child pornography as a victimless crime, for example."

He says reddit has 50M$ in the bank and is breaking even. He also goes on to mention that the board doesn't get paid they make their money in owning stock of reddit.   Most sites are valued at their unique hits, with very little in the way of what content they provide. So yes I could easily see them not giving a shit about what is on the site, remember Conde Nast bought reddit while it still has jailbait and all the other shit show subreddits.

But I'd like to chime in about how this is a victory for many.  It's a big deal for us South Carolinians.  BIG.  I'm happy as hell about it, but you need to realize one thing: the flag coming down isn't about young people.  It's about the older folks.  Them feeling like they've won something after all these years of bullshit. The flag stayed on the statehouse dome to protest the civil rights changes (damn Dixiecrats).  We tried to remove it in the 80s, they tried again in the 90s.  No go.  When it came off the dome to the grounds, it seemed very false.  But this? For any black person I know who's 40 or older it is a victory.     Also, I think the flag issue is a representation of our inability to do anything immediate to punish Dylan Roof.  Yeah, he's in jail, but they stopped at burger king on the way (allegedly).  Bringing the flag down allowed many people to regain their agency in the face of impotence.  Just a couple of thoughts.

It's still rearing its ugly head everywhere, and it has proliferated in micro-aggressions and subtle little attitudes and dog-whistle code words. So if we're actually going to beat it, we have to change the way people think. And that's where the tiny wins matter. Subtle little shifts in the public opinion and symbolic actions.

blackladies,3cu11q,plooroo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:10:36 2015 UTC,"Ok, but that's irrelevant to this situation. The Dash family aren't black  Mexicans, they are Black Americans. If Stacey Dash has Mexican heritage, that would probably make her mixed.  You aren't saying anything new, at least not to me. Mixed is usually when both parents are different races. Also, some Black Americans are aware that they are mixed, but they still identify as fully black because of their appearance. Let's not tell people how to identify, ok?"
blackladies,3cu11q,_Liquorice_,2,Sat Jul 11 06:06:47 2015 UTC,"Did I tell anyone how to identify? No I did not. I asked how many Black persons in the Americas can say that they are 100% Black and then asked you what ""fully Black"" means (to you). If you know that some people can acknowledge that they are in fact mixed but identify as fully Black then why would you ask if Stacey Dash was mixed because you thought she was ""fully Black""? To me it seemed like that question was suggesting that a ""fully Black"" person can't be Mexican.  Anyway, Stacey Dash has identified as Mexican-American apparently before. And yes, I'm aware that Stacey Dash probably is ""mixed"". I'm mixed, too, by many people's definitions, but I personally don't ever describe myself as that voluntarily. However, it's a common misconception that every Black Mexican is ""mixed"". I think most discussions of ""mixed""ness and being ""fully"" Black are laden with anti-Black racial hierarchy b.s. anyway. Ever heard of the haircare brand ""Mixed Chicks""? Eww.  And I, as an actually Black person of Mexican descent, know all about anti-Black racism and how it manifests in the lives of Black Mexicans so I really hate people making ignorant conjectures about our racial makeup when no other information is stated otherwise.   When I started school in the U.S. people always asked me what I was and I'd say I was Afro-Mexican and they'd correct me and be like ""So you're Black and Mexican?"" and eventually I just said that to avoid conflict. Now that I'm grown, I'm tired of Americans policing the identities of other Black Latino Americans and other folks in* the diaspora. Are you from Mexico? Do you know what the colonial caste system was like there? Mexicans aren't a brown, raceless monolith.  Btw, I identify as both Black Mexican(-American) and Black American--one doesn't cancel out the other. Please try and wrap your head around that. I've been talking about this subject on this thread because it matters to me because Stacey and I share a heritage with one another. Black Mexicans are a minority in Mexico and in the U.S. so I care a lot about our representation and discussions of our identities.  Edit: Sorry for novel. Just trying to explain myself as well as possible. I'm not very eloquent."

To me it seemed like that question was suggesting that a ""fully Black"" person can't be Mexican.   By trying to pose the question of how many blacks in America or the Americas can say that they are fully black is basically trying to make us identity as something other than black. Black people across nations (in the Americas) vary, so identifiers that may be common in, say, Mexico are vastly different in the U.S. The two cannot be compared. In the U.S. nationality turns into ethnicity. When I said that some Black Americans are aware that they are mixed, I meant mixed as in somewhere down the line. For example, I have European ancestry but it's not recent. I don't go around saying I'm mixed.   I can understand the frustration, but you are lashing out at the wrong people. This sub is not made up of the same people from your school. Latino is not a race, I get it. I think you are confusing my identifiers with something else. When I say Black Americans, I don't mean every black person who is a U.S. citizen. I mean Black people who are descendants of slaves brought here, an actual Afro-American. So, if both of your parents are Mexican, you wouldn't be considered a Black American or Afro-American.  Also, the surname Dash is seen in the Hip-Hop industry and I believe Stacey is their cousin. Damon Dash and the other one (I forgot his name) are both Black Americans, which makes Stacey Black and Mexican.  Your arguments would apply if both of Stacey's parents were Mexican, regardless of their races, but one parent is Black American and her Mexican parent's race is unknown. Since this is the case and if her Mexican parents is not black, then she's not a black Mexican and calling her one is erasing her Black/Afro-American identity."
blackladies,3cu11q,_Liquorice_,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:16:51 2015 UTC,"So, if both of your parents are Mexican, you wouldn't be considered a Black American or Afro-American.   See, you're the one trying to tell people how to identify. Not me. My mother is Black American and that's why I identify as both Black Mexican-American and Black American as do A LOT of people whose parents are from the same backgrounds as mine. However, I think any Black person born and raised in the U.S. has a right to identify as a Black American if they so wish.    By trying to pose the question of how many blacks in America or the Americas can say that they are fully black is basically trying to make us identity as something other than black   I think I already pointed out the flaw in your logic about how you worded your brief statement. I'm not trying to make anyone identify as something other than Black. I've been trying to explain to you that it doesn't matter if Stacey is ""fully Black"" or mixed when it comes to discussing her being Mexican. You brought that up. Not me.  Again, I think you're actually the one trying to police people's identities more than I am. Because of that, I was trying to point out to you how problematic you were being in regards to that. There is a difference between saying Stacey is Black American and Mexican* (but why does Mexican not require a racial qualifier before it?!), and, Stacey is Black and Mexican. I think I've explained myself as best as I can. If you meant Black American instead of Black, that's all you had to say. That would make much more sense. Because the identifier of just ""Black"" doesn't exclusive belong to or isn't exclusively applied to Black Americans* descended from enslaved persons. However, I still think it is wrong to suggest that ""Mexican"" automatically equals ""Not Black"". Mexico's first president was a Black man, for pete's sake. I'm not lashing out at anyone. I'm discussing a topic that is important to me. You really should not try to speak over actual Black people of Mexican heritage, you know."
blackladies,3cu11q,lovelyone20,0,Sat Jul 11 20:01:56 2015 UTC,"Because Black/Afro-American is an ethnicity. Many do not like the term African-American. If I had a child in Nigeria with another American, could I slap an Igbo or some other Nigerian ethnicity title on my child? No, I can't. Since that is wrong, then it applies to being called Black/Afro-American. Yes, in this case, I will police this term because it's erasure to identify as it if you have not ties to this ethnicity.  You are clearly not comprehending my previous comment because you keep trying to tell me that black Mexicans exist when I never said or implied that they didn't. I was also quite clear on what I meant in regards to black vs Black American or Black American vs Black Mexican."
blackladies,3cu11q,plooroo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:15:51 2015 UTC,"Not touching your Nigerian born child hypothesis because you've created another false equivalency.   And you tell me not to tell other people  how to identify, but then you admit that you are in fact policing others' identities. Ok, cool. I'm not trying to attack anyone on this subreddit by mentioning my school experience anecdote; it's just that I know people do not exist in a social vacuum and that kind of thinking has followed me all my life.  At the end of the day, it's all up to Stacey to identify as she pleases because the way she was raised probably has a lot to do with how she sees herself. My cousins and I don't identify ourselves the same way; my brother and I don't even identify ourselves the same and we grew up in the same household. I began this discussion because I am tired of seeing folks talk about Afro-Latino Americans in problematic ways. I do not understand why folks have a hard time accepting that someone may identify as Black American and a Black Mexican or Mexican-American because that is what someone like Stacey is--a Mexican(-American) who is Black. However, it's also up to others to not discuss her racial and ethnic background in historically incorrect, socially ignorant, and anti-Black manners by jumping to ask if she's mixed because they thought she was fully Black because someone mentioned she was of Mexican descent. Perhaps it is difficult to see this from the POV of Afro-Latino Americans. I've definitely have had this discussion with other Afro-Latinos and they see from where I am coming. I'm sorry.  It's interesting to me though that it seems to me that by your logic Barack Obama is not Black American and yet that is how he personally identifies and how others view him. There is no perfect descriptor for those of us descended from enslaved African persons in the U.S., it's all about context and nuance for the most part in navigating those discussions. It's a reality that we have to share the terms Black American/African-American with Black folks who were born in the U.S. but have parents born in other countries. Gatekeeping the term is a fruitless endeavor in my opinion that only others Black immigrants and creates social divisions between Black folks living in the U.S. I think it's important to talk about our differences (which is why I piped up in the first place) but I respectfully disagree with you that the term Black American solely applies to us whose ancestors were enslaved in the states the U.S. occupies.  I appreciate this dialogue but I ask that you please be more mindful of how your questions might make others feel and perhaps try and re-word said questions,"
blackladies,3cu11q,LeifEriksonisawesome,-1,Sat Jul 11 20:26:13 2015 UTC,"Not touching your Nigerian born child hypothesis because you've created another false equivalency.    How? And I said that I will police the term Afro/Black American because it describes a particular ethnicity and if you have no ties to it, then you cannot call yourself this term. This term has a culture and history, just like any other ethnicity. It's not some moniker that can be applied simply because you are of the black race and born or naturalized in America. If you can see that other ethnicities like Latino cannot be applied to anyone without any ties, then it's the same for Black/Afro-American.  People who are descendants of slaves from the U.S. have descriptors such as African American, Black American or Afro-American. You are claiming Mexican or Latino identity, but are speaking for a totally different one other than your own. This is my identity and this is how we identify ourselves. You may disagree with it, but it's moot when you have the Mexican flag, and are speaking about Afro-Latino experiences. It ignores our experiences that sometimes do not intersect with Afro-Latino experiences. It's not gatekeeping, it's still a form of recognizing and appreciating our differences. It seems like it's okay for any black immigrant to come here and jump into the Black/Afro-American identity, but the inverse is always wrong. The only bond is being racially black, not really much else. Ethnic descriptors seem to go away when Black Americans speak of our experiences and we are forced to include other black ethnicities. That is also erasure.  For your Obama example, some Black Americans have questioned what it would be like to have an actual Black American in office and not someone who has Kenyan heritage. They were called out and told to stop the separatism and told how ""we're all black"".    So back to Stacey, if both of her parents are Mexican, then yes, she would probably identity as a black Mexican. If one parent is Black American as in an African-American or Afro-American, and the other is Mexican (black or non-black), then she's Black American and Mexican. She can identify however she wants, but this is how she would be viewed when both cultures are taken into account. Calling her simply a Black American or Black Mexican is erasing the other half of her identity."

How about shy and quiet?  Nerdy and well-read?,  Weird and random?  Literally ANYTHING that shows some imagination in writing black women and reflects the diversity of actual black women???"

blackladies,3csrs8,RhombusBlue,9,Fri Jul 10 14:59:08 2015 UTC,YES LAWD.
blackladies,3csrs8,Omgitstheash,7,Fri Jul 10 16:38:33 2015 UTC,She worked it. Flinging the wig off of her head was so necessary.
blackladies,3csrs8,meadeater2014,8,Fri Jul 10 19:13:36 2015 UTC,"<3 Alek Wek! She's one of my personal favorite models! She doesn't get nearly as much press as she deserves IMO. I will never understand why designers shy away from dark women like Alek- metallics like gold and bright vivid colors are so striking on her! And I will forever be jealous of how glowing her skin is- seriously, she's like supernaturally gorgeous.  ...Also, that wig was fugly- so much better with her natural hair!"

blackladies,3cpsrl,femmefinale,37,Thu Jul 9 20:17:55 2015 UTC,Serena Williams will be the tennis legend remembered for all time though. Money can't buy that kind of legacy.
blackladies,3cpsrl,beeUnit,20,Thu Jul 9 22:53:12 2015 UTC,Right? Money can't change the fact that Sharapova was shat on 17 straight times.
blackladies,3cpsrl,mangaloree,42,Fri Jul 10 01:09:13 2015 UTC,"This one, I won't even 100% blame on consumers. I'm betting agencies aren't even trying to send the same money Serena's way."
blackladies,3cpsrl,RhombusBlue,27,Thu Jul 9 20:43:46 2015 UTC,"The best part is the circle jerk logic that gets constantly battered around:  ""We can't sell Serena Williams, no one knows her/wants her in a commercial. We can't just spend money on something we know won't work hurr hurr durr.""  BECAUSE YOU DON'T MARKET HER AT ALL IN THE FIRST PLACE!   You can sell her by putting her in the advertising in the first place."
blackladies,3cpsrl,DreamingMerc,12,Thu Jul 9 22:36:51 2015 UTC,"Yep. But they'll say ""it's the market""...as if people and their biases about beauty aren't involved."

White privilege is you show up, you are not the best at your occupation and you will STILL be showered with attention and money for having the ""right look"".    ...And then there is Serena, arguably the best of all time at her occupation, and still makes less because she's black.    I hope she shapes her own brand well after she's done with her career and manages to make what she's actually worth."

I honestly suspect she may have blown up the way she did because she was so bad and therefore less threatening to men's boners.

Or she could never retire and keep winning titles with a walker."

I guess it depends on whether or not she can actually teach what she does.  A lot of exceptional people can't tell you how to do what they do.  Ooh, I got a little off topic there . . .

Damn. That's just twisted enough that I think you might be right :(  Just look at all the bullshit reddit spews about women's sports....
blackladies,3cpsrl,ArsenicAndRoses,8,Fri Jul 10 12:12:32 2015 UTC,Kornakova and Sharapova looked identical to me...  I've been on r/soccer a lot lately since there have been so many tournaments on and its so funny. There are more than a few whiners trying to shut down women's world cup posts or complain about the quality of play because deep down they know being the best at fifa among their friends does not equate with the talent and skill the women in the tournament have. It does not please the penis.
blackladies,3cpsrl,quaglady,17,Fri Jul 10 12:18:19 2015 UTC,And straight up...she's prettier than Sharapova.
blackladies,3cpsrl,RhombusBlue,7,Thu Jul 9 23:37:24 2015 UTC,"I wasnt gonna say nothing but that white gene is kicking in, when it comes to aging. I'm seeing some crinkles. Serena is gorgeous, but she's usually so poorly styled.  And the dat brow and liner game is rough."
blackladies,3cpsrl,garnetsquarefro,2,Fri Jul 10 03:15:52 2015 UTC,"Lol...I haven't been a fan of her brows at all lately...but in general, even when Sharapova wasn't starting to crack, Serena is prettier.   Edit: Just took another look at Sharapova. Everybody knows good and well she'd be considered ""plain"" on the street by WM and WW alike. I swear 75% of her monetary success is in juxtaposition to Serena's existence."
blackladies,3cpsrl,RhombusBlue,18,Fri Jul 10 14:41:52 2015 UTC,"ANY TIME I read an article about the injustices, inequalities and abuses the Williams sisters, especially Serena, have to put up with from various sources I get SO angry. Like, I'm so glad I'm just chillin' at home by myself now...  Edit: Now I'm gonna only start supporting brands (with my money) with whom Serena is affiliated. HMMPH."
blackladies,3cpsrl,plooroo,20,Thu Jul 9 23:17:54 2015 UTC,"They talked about this a little bit during the match, actually.  I wasn't at all surprised to hear it, and it was no mystery to me why."
blackladies,3cpsrl,catofnortherndarknes,4,Thu Jul 9 22:05:42 2015 UTC,"Serena has her own clothing line everyone. Just an FYI. Feel free to read comments on her clothing, trolls there too."
blackladies,3cpsrl,ParticularYouth,7,Fri Jul 10 12:10:07 2015 UTC,"Having her own line probably cuts into her potential endorsements a lot.  Swim wear, shoes, active wear, American sportswear, etc.  Why would a company use a person for their product when they have their own competing product?  Why would a person endorse a product, when they are trying to come up with their own line?    Her company tried to relaunch in 2013 but the website is still inactive.  It could account for the 2.4 million dollar discrepancy.  And while Serena is bogged down with trying to make Aneres.com happen, Maria ""Can't win"" Sharapova is free to swoop in and get the company endorsement that may have preferred unavailable Serena."
blackladies,3cpsrl,whinniethepony,6,Fri Jul 10 14:15:05 2015 UTC,"Now while I WOULD agree with this. Sharapova's endorsement deals include but are not limited to: Motorola, Land Rover, Canon, and Tiffany. None of these brands compete with sportswear or the like. You can take an example of someone like Kim Kardashian who also has a clothing line AND endorsement deals through the roof."
blackladies,3cpsrl,cardboardsoles,7,Fri Jul 10 16:05:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't care. I was young when I became interested in tennis. I wasn't familiar with tennis but I stumbled upon Wimbledon on HBO one summer and learned the dynamics of the game. By the time players like Graf, Sampras, Aggasi, Seles and that whole era, I was a super fan for life. Over the years, tennis has become my #2 favorite sport.   I never dreamed that Serena would reach the status of Graf.  I knew she would have a great career but she has surpassed my and everyone's expectations. Steffi Graf was an assassin on the court and to reach that status is not an easy feat.  As a tennis fan, I am happy to be there throughout the eras of many of the greatest women tennis players the world has ever seen and an honor to watch Serena meet them in tennis history.    So, Sharapova can have the endorsements because Serena owns the courts."
blackladies,3cpsrl,lovelyone20,19,Thu Jul 9 23:00:27 2015 UTC,"So, Sharapova can have the endorsements because Serena owns the courts.   Nah, I care, when Serena retires and wants to spend a little extra  money from all the great events she completed on the court. She should be able to dip into her super savings to pull some out. I will always care when they're paying  one of the greatest athletes of all time, lower than they are paying someone who is just good."
blackladies,3cpsrl,cardboardsoles,3,Fri Jul 10 02:48:28 2015 UTC,"That's just it. If Sharapova was earning more prize money for being mediocre on the court, that's one thing, but she isn't.  It's messed up, sure. Halfway decent looking white blonde woman who plays decent tennis make more money in endorsements than one of the arguably best women tennis players ever..yes, it's messed up. It's expected. Is anyone really surprised? I'm not. Remember Anna Kournikova? She had more hype than Sharapova because she fit the profile.  But where is she now?  She's the same age as Serena and she isn't playing tennis. I still don't care. One, they both have a net worth over 100 million dollars and two, it isn't my 100 millions dollars.   When those endorsement checks stop coming, Sharpova will still be known as the player who Serena stomped 17 straight times while Serena will be known as the best women's tennis player ever.  So what she makes more money in endorsements. She can used all those dollar bills to soak up all those salty tears.   I do hope Serena gets what she deserves though.  She definitely deserves it."
blackladies,3cpsrl,emilie0444,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:05:06 2015 UTC,"I think that's what it is. I think Serena is beautiful but I often wonder who does her hair, choses her outfits, does her makeup because she sometimes looks a hot mess. I think if she tried to be more conventionally beautiful it would work in her favor. I find the other woman very plain and average looking compared to Serena."
blackladies,3cpsrl,Afle_mobile,7,Fri Jul 10 09:09:23 2015 UTC,"I like that Serena doesn't try to conform to mainstream culture while being out in the public eye. Many ""play the game"" to try to get ahead in white supremacist culture (because yes we are judged on a different level otherwise there would be no ""game"" to play) but it makes them believe that their own culture is ugly and ghetto. I appreciate Serena showing up in her classic Black girl styles because that helps young black girls with the same hair styles with self esteem. When I was a young girl, I wished my hair was straight and wavy like non-Black girls at school and pretty women on tv. The Black women who chose to play the game like Destiny's Child also inspired that thinking. When I told my mom I wanted hair that blew in the wind she braided my hair and beaded them so I could shake my hair and make noise. For me it was a self esteem booster, pretty, and fun.   Maybe if young girls see such hairstyles on a famous and amazing person like Serena, they won't grow up thinking that styles that ate good and healthy for Black hair and styles drawing from centuries old Black culture is something to look down upon or feel less than because."
blackladies,3cpsrl,emilie0444,3,Fri Jul 10 11:42:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe if young girls see such hairstyles on a famous and amazing person like Serena, they won't grow up thinking that styles that ate good and healthy for Black hair and styles drawing from centuries old Black culture is something to look down upon or feel less than because.   Good point. I agree with you 100%"

blackladies,3cpsrl,emilie0444,5,Fri Jul 10 18:34:05 2015 UTC,"I wasn't referring to her face because she is beautiful. I meant her dress, makeup, and hair and style to appeal more to the masses. Should they endorse her based on skill, of course, but it's more than that and advertisers know that.."
blackladies,3cpsrl,badkarmabum,5,Fri Jul 10 12:11:43 2015 UTC,What's with the sigh? You don't think Serena should conform to white beauty standards for some money? How appalling!
blackladies,3cpsrl,ArsenicAndRoses,5,Fri Jul 10 13:27:50 2015 UTC,"I think Serena is beautiful but I often wonder who does her hair, choses her outfits, does her makeup because she sometimes looks a hot mess.   I've worked in the modeling industry and you'd be appalled at how many ""makeup artists"" have no idea what to do with darker skin.  And when so much of what reads on camera is careful styling and makeup, it can make a huge difference.    I find the other woman very plain and average looking compared to Serena.    Agreed. Serena is radiant."
blackladies,3cpsrl,mixdkinkster83,2,Fri Jul 10 14:01:54 2015 UTC,When she is playing why would she worry about make up and all that?  Or are you talking about off the court or something?

When I (Caucasian) leave my hair to do it's own thing, it looks like I've been dragged through a hedge backwards and then dipped in a chip pan, a look which many people would look at with disgust.   you can walk around with nappy, yucky hair and nobody will call you out on it.   Definitely not. If I turned up to work looking like that, I would absolutely be called up on it.    Hahahaha, I'm dying over here. Wtf is she even taking about?

blackladies,3cofrw,KhaleesiBubblegum,17,Thu Jul 9 21:23:37 2015 UTC,"What a shit show. I think she's like the vast majority of white people: she has never talked with anyone in the 3C & Type 4 curl range and has absolutely no idea how different that hair type is from her own.   I think when most White people hear ""natural"", they think ""less upkeep"". They see straight-hair people who let their hair and beards grow out with very little styling or care, and assume ""natural"" hairstyles are a result of Black people basically doing the same thing. And since hair that's styled like this or this or this looks fifteen thousand times better than this (possibly NSFW), they conclude ""Oh, Black hair looks so amazing when you don't do anything with it!"" There is no comprehension of how much time the women in those photos and people with similar hairstyles likely spend on hair upkeep.   So yeah, I would bet you she genuinely believes ""controlled"" fros are what happens if someone with kinky hair texture does nothing with it besides the occasional wash and condition. Shit, that's what I thought until I fell down a natural hair care internet hole a number of years ago. It was a real wake-up call and I felt pretty ashamed of how little I fundamentally understood about the topic.    I would like to think most of those people would say less dumb shit if they spent 15 minutes on a website dedicated to natural Black hair care.  But then again, they're so convinced they know what's up they don't listen when Black women try to explain how wrong they are."

I usually don't get into these arguments because of how draining they are. I never feel like it was worth it. You always end up repeating yourself multiple times. I get really frustrated.

I have been rejected by hair stylists so often that I learned how to cut my own fucking hair. Like, literally told, I don't cut your type of hair so I can't do anything for you. I once walked in to a hair salon and BEFORE opening my mouth the person said ""No! I won't do black hair!""  Welp, I was actually looking for directions, but thanks for that up front.  Not ever trying to learn how to style ""black"" hair when hair is your fucking trade is internalized hatred. There are a handful of women who ""do"" black hair in my city and I only trust three to touch mine:  My sister. Myself. My former hairstylist (a Vietnamese woman who worked in the city's foremost black salon for a decade. She's better than all of the women at the salon combined, mainly because she doesn't think my scalp can take a beating and doesn't yank my hair out.)"

It's one thing to be an ally, and know that while you won't know what it's like to be a POC in today's society, you can understand what we go through. It's quite another to claim you get the struggle, and you totally know what it's like to be oppressed and marginalized.   You don't. You won't. Sit down. Shut up.

Also, I just want to add the people who are saying ""I love afros they're so beautiful ""  are full of shit. Whenever their hair looks a mess the first thing they will compare it to is an afro. They would never want natural black hair, most just find it amusing."

I had this AAWWWFFFUULLL White woman manager once who was basically the personification of the Terrible White Feminist. Like, I didn't fully understand what they were doing until I spent years working under her, and then it all made sense.   When I went natural, she immediately became ""supportive"" in loud, pandering ways, began telling me how much volume her hair had if she didn't straighten it (hers was wavy at most) and how much her husband loved afros.   Their beauty culture is highly comparative (IMO, Black women tend to lean more expressive, Asian, conformative). It scares them because if our hair is considered anything but ugly, then theirs isn't as special. Liberals can't put it down, so they try to control."

You are seriously onto something with this... white beauty culture is entirely comparative/competitive. ""Oh my GAWD, you're so pretty! I totally hate you!"" Is a compliment, because jealousy and the admission of feeling insecure because of it, is the highest compliment a white woman can pay another.   So the attempt to co-opt the natural hair movement, I think, has a lot to do with trying to frame it in a way that can make black hair and white hair fair game for comparison.

I have a really hard time taking expressions of jealousy and hatred as compliments, even when genuine. I get where they're coming from. I get the cultural differences. It still creeps me out a bit and comes off like a threat.    I think, has a lot to do with trying to frame it in a way that can make black hair and white hair fair game for comparison.

blackladies,3cltru,meadeater2014,7,Thu Jul 9 02:03:49 2015 UTC,Exactly. They couldn't even keep people from claiming they're 1/16 Cherokee in order to squat on native reservations.
blackladies,3cltru,GiveHerTheDeak,11,Thu Jul 9 02:41:49 2015 UTC,"I can't tell if you're being sarcastic, but if not, the situations are entirely different. First, I don't believe reparations in the 21st century would come in the form of tracts of land. There is a worldwide trend of increasing urbanization and 40-acres-and-a-mule just isn't going to cut it. If anything, I imagine they would be similar to reparations received by Japanese Americans 40-some-odd years after their internment - a significant amount of money. Second, the living conditions on many of the Indian reservations are deplorable and it would make sense why no one's exactly clamoring to move to them."
blackladies,3cltru,lottikey,4,Thu Jul 9 03:04:43 2015 UTC,"a significant amount of money.    Loosely.   From Wikipedia:   In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed into law the Civil Liberties Act, which apologized for the internment on behalf of the U.S. government and authorized a payment of $20,000 to each individual camp survivor. The legislation admitted that government actions were based on ""race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership"".[16] The U.S. government eventually disbursed more than $1.6 billion in reparations to 82,219 Japanese Americans who had been interned and their heirs.[15][17]   In a way, it's still a decent amount of money.  I used online converters and it seems to be around $40,000 in today's dollars which is something, but considering how the government seized all their possessions beforehand and they had nothing to even go back to (imagine entire neighborhoods uprooted), it's starter change.  Of course, since it's per person, families tend to be larger then so that would add up, but a lot of families were broken up and separated so that also factors in.  Either way, I totally agree, I just don't trust that this would be done.  I would rather have the system overhauled to rid itself of the injustices than monetary reparations."
blackladies,3cltru,GiveHerTheDeak,2,Thu Jul 9 05:46:10 2015 UTC,"but considering how the government seized all their possessions beforehand   They never fucking told me this in school. They made it sound like every Japanese person was simply sent on school buses to some kind of summer camp for a bit. God damn.   But anyways, I figure if a collective effort were undertaken, money could be pooled together (via some magically non-corrupt organization) to kickstart (no, not that one) a development plan for an economically depressed and predominantly black urban area. Somewhere with cheap real estate, like Detroit. Pretty unlikely to work in reality (complacency, intra-racial trust issues), but it's an idea."

blackladies,3cltru,eroverton,5,Thu Jul 9 06:04:31 2015 UTC,"Money is a terrible idea, IMO. (EDIT: Let me rephrase. Money is very nice, and if that's the form it would take, that's fine. But just handing a lot of individuals a bunch of money is more likely to enrich white institutions than to do anything substantial for us. If enough of us had the presence of mind to use the money for the purposes I stated below, it's still effective, but it seems to me that given a choice between the two, land is far more valuable than cash alone.)  What would most of us do but turn around and give it straight back to them? And I don't even mean in the stereotypically foolish way that people say - immediately buying flashy things - I mean we can't help but to give it back to them because they control the resources and the basic life necessities. In order for a monetary reparation to mean anything to us, we would need the ability to build upon it, and we can't build upon it if we have to turn around and give it back to them immediately for our food, shelter, power, and so on.  Land is the only thing with real meaningful value for reparations because land is the foundation of an economic base. From land, we can produce the things we need to live - without it, we continue to rely on others to provide those things for us, and have no choice in what we get from them. But if we can provide for ourselves, we can control our own health and sustenance. Then, after providing for our own needs, we can export surplus and that's the beginning of a trade economy. With land, we can choose how to police our own communities, we can build and control our own educational systems, and so on and so on and so on."
blackladies,3cltru,lottikey,3,Thu Jul 9 10:34:10 2015 UTC,"What is land useful for if they're giving it to people who don't have the means or resources to build up on it?  Land is worse.  I agree with the poster above - giving a parcel of land isn't going to happen in this day and age, we don't want more sprawl, we want to urbanize (or at least suburbanize) this country.  And even if we take it more broadly, not just farmland, but land used for commercial or residential purposes, why would this be a good idea to give to those that may not even have the means to support their family let alone a major financial endeavor?  This could really backfire and then you have scores of black families who end up underwater trying to maintain or build upon their land and now owing more to banks, etc.    Money is a better way than land, folks have a greater range to use it for.  We live in the US, white people already own this whole country.  Even if we give our money to black businesses, those same ones hold their own in white banks.  (Not trying to downplay the importance of black businesses, we NEED way more and black Wall Street again, I'm just not going to stay pressed about giving back to white people because that's unavoidable for the most part).  Money could be used to better ourselves through education, through entrepreneurship, by staying financially secure, etc.  If they want to use it to secure land, by all means, but we do not live in a time where everyone would have the know how and put in the work to develop land.  We simply don't.   Then, after providing for our own needs, we can export surplus and that's the beginning of a trade economy.   That's not how that works.  By 'trade economy' it seems like you're referring to international trade or state trade which is all regulated on the federal level.   Do you just mean that we can now fully participate in the economy by providing goods and services?  That is already happening."
blackladies,3cltru,eroverton,2,Thu Jul 9 16:58:15 2015 UTC,"Money is a better way than land, folks have a greater range to use it for.   This right here is the problem. The things we have to use it for pours the wealth right back out of our pockets and into theirs. We have money. Collectively, we have over a trillion spending power. But we spend it with them which is why collectively, our communities remain among the poorest.   white people already own this whole country.   ... not if we had the land to control for ourselves.   What is land useful for if they're giving it to people who don't have the means or resources to build up on it?   This is where education comes in. We need to stop getting 'higher education' that doesn't teach us how to produce for ourselves and start focusing on learning what to do with some land when we have some.   'trade economy'   Yes, I was referring to international (or interstate, sure) trade, on our own terms. Apologies if that was the wrong term for that."

We have money. Collectively, we have over a trillion spending power. But we spend it with them which is why collectively, our communities remain among the poorest.   And why does it matter if white people get their hands on it if black people are spending it rightly on themselves and our communities?  That's not how it works, this isolationist method never works in the long run.  Again, they already own this country, it's impossible to avoid it flowing back to them, even in the slightest, and I don't care if it does as long as black people can share the wealth and develop themselves, their families, their communities, their lives.   Higher education and/or vocational training is important, we need more educated folks who understands how to build another black Wall Street, more networks where we don't have to depend on white people for shit, more middle and upper class communities so our successes aren't continually treated as anomalies or welfare, etc.  How do you expect we get these resources if we don't continue educating ourselves?     Yes, I was referring to international (or interstate, sure) trade, on our own terms. Apologies if that was the wrong term for that.   That's not how it works.  No country allows a faction of itself to engage in international or regional trade which is fine because it makes no sense.  As long as we continue to build businesses and sell our services and goods without selling out to a white company or consumer, we're all good.  Let's get to a point where people are falling over themselves buying OUR services."
blackladies,3cltru,eroverton,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:47:02 2015 UTC,"It matters because that's what we do NOW. It's impossible to build collective wealth when our dollars don't circulate. Our dollars don't circulate because we don't produce. We don't produce because we don't own the means of production and therefore we are forced to consistently hemorrhage our money away before we can ever build actual wealth for our own children.  Let me ask you. Do you consider places like Chinatown, Koreatown, Little Italy, and various Jewish communities to be isolationist? Those are communities with real wealth. Byt that wealth has a land base. They don't just spend with each other, they produce the things that they supply for themselves and their money circulates and builds instead of being handed over to other people just to survive. This allows them to have control over their own basic resources, build schools, financial institutions, media conglomerates, and so forth."
blackladies,3cltru,lottikey,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:10:12 2015 UTC,"So when we're using it amongst ourselves, it's no longer circulating?  Why is land a better deal than money then?  You didn't address any of my points from before.  We don't produce anything because we're generally poor.  How do we become richer?  By developing ourselves and no, giving out land reparations to those that have no clue what to do with it is the fastest way to fuck us up even further.  We don't produce because we can't afford to.  There are black businesses, it's our faults if we don't support them as much as we can since we're the backbone of them unlike with a lot of the other races who don't depend on us.  You are using terms that don't make sense together.  You're first talking about trade economy when that refers to trading between states or countries, not something super micro as towns and neighborhoods.    Do you consider places like Chinatown, Koreatown, Little Italy, and various Jewish communities to be isolationist?   The way isolationist was used prior isn't the same as how it's used now.  In relation to trade it's basically shutting out all foreign competitors in favor of your own and something like that doesn't work in the long run since no one can efficiently produce everything they need and thrive on it.  The difference is: saying black Americans should keep to themselves to build themselves versus black Americans should game/interact with the system and making sure our successes stays funnel in to build us all up.  The former is isolationist and bad.  Yes, I consider those neighborhoods (or communities generally) segregated and I think it's largely a good thing for the exact same reasons you've stated, but you're vastly underestimating how integrated all those are in American society.  The last two are white...there's no point in comparing Italians and Jewish people to black people and our wealth disparities.  Jewish folks are all up in the high ranks of American society, they don't keep to a bubble like isolationist would imply.  Same with Italians but not as pervasive.  We could definitely aspire to the former two though.  Of course, their main pulls is that their respective home countries do a lot of trade with the US and they're more or less known as cheap sources of their niche products/services.    Anyway, we seem to agree, it's just the semantics are off and that's where the misunderstandings are being brought from.  Again, no good comes from us creating a bubble and not try to play with the system as a community.  First, it wouldn't work because we're among the poorest in the country and like you said we're very dependent on others for production.  Second, even if we did have the financial means to stick with the bubble, honestly what's better: be isolated from them with this 'this is our crap, that is your crap' or be more efficient with getting what we need from the system enough where we thrive.  Where the script is flipped and instead of us relying on them for the goods/services, it's the opposite."

Even if there was some provision for the taxes, the land would be far away from recipients both geographically and in terms of relevance to their lives.  Millions of people would be selling their land at the same time, resulting in a big price drop. Cue rich developers buying it all up, essentially turning the whole operation into a transfer of land from the government to private sector at steeply discounted prices. And all in the name of reparations."

It could also be used to shut up the people who claim to be ""1/16 Cherokee"", ""a descendant of a Cherokee princess"" or those ""with some Native heritage"". Actual white Americans have ~14% black ancestry. I feel like we should go by the common percentage as a start, so that anything lower or slightly higher than ~14% should be excluded. It should only be open to black people who are descendants of slaves brought to the U.S., as well."

I'd just like to see more imaginative fantasy, sci-fi, universe-expanding (I mean both literal and figurative) stuff with POC starring in it because I'm tired of seeing the same perspectives, the same limited gaze.  It's boring.  We need more Belle's and Life of Pi's and After Earth's except actually GOOD.  I roll my eyes anytime I see an all-white space in the past or future -as if we didn't exist then (except as slaves trying to get free) and won't exist in any useful capacity in the future.  With other genres it doesn't bother me quite as much, personally, as those two.  The past especially, because it fosters ignorance, especially when coupled with whitewashing a culture. Rome had a ton of black people in it, including a black emperor.    One reason I like Starz Spartacus is that they did showcase the diversity of that culture for both POC and sexualities."

He freed himself, his crew and their families from slavery on May 13, 1862, when he led an uprising aboard a Confederate transport ship, the CSS Planter, in Charleston harbor, and sailed it north to freedom. His feat  successfully helped persuade President Abraham Lincoln to accept African-American soldiers into the Union Army.  As a politician, Smalls authored state legislation that gave South Carolina the first free and compulsory public school system in the United States.  Madam Efunroye Tinubu (c.1805-1887)  Madam Tinubu was born in Yorubaland, an area in what is now known as Nigeria. She was a major political and business player, who campaigned against the influence of the British Empire over her people and for the elimination of slavery. She became the first Iyalode of the Egba clan and is considered an important figure in Nigerian history because of her political significance as a powerful female aristocrat in West Africa. Iyalode  (queen of ladies) is a title commonly bestowed on the most prominent and distinguished woman in a town. After Tinubu, a former slave trader herself, realized the treatment of Africans enslaved in Europe and the Americas was far more inhumane than the way slavery was practiced in Africa, she became a scathing opponent of all forms of slavery and used her influence to try to eliminate the practice in her region.  Noble Drew Ali (1886-1929)  Noble Drew Ali, who was born Timothy Drew of North Carolina, was the founder of the Moorish Science Temple of America in Newark, N.J., in 1923. Soon after there were branches in Pittsburgh, Detroit, and other major industrial cities of the Northeast.  Ali saw Black nationalist leader Marcus Garvey as the inspiration for his own efforts. He wanted to present to Black people a message of pride, self-determination, personal transformation and self-sufficiency.  Ali also intended to provide African-Americans with a sense of identity in the West, and promote civic involvement.  His movement inspired other leaders such as Fard Muhammad and Elijah Muhammad, leading to the creation of the Nation of Islam.  Claudette Colvin (born Sept. 5, 1939)  On March 2, 1955, a full nine months before Rosa Parks’ famous arrest, Claudette Colvin was dragged from a Montgomery bus by two police officers, arrested and taken to an adult jail to be booked. She was only 15 years old and was the first person to be arrested for defying bus segregation in Montgomery.  Her arrest and her story has long since been forgotten, but it provided the spark for the Black community in Montgomery that ultimately led to Parks’ actions, the bus boycott, and the Supreme Court ruling to end segregation on buses.  Benjamin Singleton (1809–1900)  Benjamin “Pap” Singleton  was an American activist and businessman best known for his role in establishing African-American settlements in Kansas.  Held in slavery in Tennessee, Singleton escaped to freedom in 1846 and became a noted abolitionist, community leader and spokesman for African-American civil rights. He returned to Tennessee during the Union occupation in 1862, but soon concluded that Blacks would never achieve economic equality in the white-dominated South.  After the end of Reconstruction, Singleton organized the movement of thousands of Black colonists, known as Exodusters, to found settlements in Kansas. A prominent early voice for Black nationalism, he became involved in promoting and coordinating Black-owned businesses in Kansas, and developed an interest in the Back-to-Africa movement.  Matthew Henson (Aug. 8, 1866 – March 9, 1955)  Born to sharecroppers on a farm in Nanjemoy, Md., Matthew Alexander Henson became the first African-American Arctic explorer, and is credited by many as the first man to reach the North Pole, in 1909.  Henson was an associate of the American explorer Robert Peary on seven voyages over a period of nearly 23 years.  Henson served as a navigator and craftsman, traded with Inuit and learned their language. He was known as Peary’s “first man” when it came to tackling the arduous expeditions.  Miriam Makeba (March 4, 1932 –  Nov.  9, 2008)  Miriam Makeba or “Mama Africa,” was a South African singer and civil rights activist, known for denouncing apartheid on the world stage and campaigning abroad for the end of the oppressive policy.  As a result of her activism, her South African passport was revoked in 1960 by the apartheid regime, and they banned her from returning to her country in 1963. However, the world came to Makeba’s aid and Guinea, Belgium and Ghana issued her international passports. She received passports from six other countries in her lifetime, and was granted honorary citizenship in 10 countries.  Despite the success that made her a star, she refused to wear makeup or curl her hair for performances, proudly wearing what came to be known internationally as the “Afro-look.”  Her fourth marriage to civil rights activist, Black Panther, and Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee leader Stokely Carmichael in 1968 caused controversy in the United States, and her record deals and tours were canceled. The couple then moved to Guinea, and as the apartheid system crumbled, she returned to South Africa for the first time in 1990.  Martin Delany (May 6, 1812 – Jan. 24, 1885)  Martin Robison Delany was an African-American abolitionist, journalist, physician and writer. He was born free in Charles Town, W.Va. (then part of Virginia, a slave state). Delany was an outspoken Black nationalist, arguably the first; and is considered by some to be the grandfather of Black nationalism.  He was also one of the first three Blacks admitted to Harvard Medical School. Trained as an assistant and a physician, he treated patients during the cholera epidemics of 1833 and 1854 in Pittsburgh, when many doctors and residents fled the city.  Active in recruiting Blacks for the United States Colored Troops, he was commissioned as a major, the first African-American field officer in the United States Army during the American Civil War.  Henry McNeal Turner  (Feb. 1, 1834 – May 8, 1915)  Henry McNeal Turner was a minister, politician, and the first Southern bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church.  Born free in South Carolina, he  moved to Georgia after the American Civil War, where he pioneered in organizing new congregations for the independent Black denomination.  Angered by the Democrats’ regaining power and instituting Jim Crow laws in the late 19th-century South, Turner began to support Black nationalism and the emigration of Blacks to Africa.  He was the chief figure in the late 19th century to promote the movement, which expanded after World War I.  Soledad Brothers  The Soledad Brothers were three African-American prison inmates: George Jackson, co-founder of the Black Guerilla Family, and Fleeta Drumgo and John Clutchette. The three were falsely accused of beating a white prison guard and throwing him from a third-floor tier to his death at California’s Soledad Prison on Jan. 16, 1970. The murder occurred just a few days after another white guard shot and killed three Black inmates by firing from a tower into the courtyard during a racial fist fight.  The Soledad brothers had recently led a hunger strike to combat the abusive, inhumane practices that led to the death of several Black inmates, when they were indicted for the murder.  Opie G. Miller, the guard who shot the three Black inmates, was exonerated in a secret trial where none of the Black inmates who witnessed the shootings were permitted to testify.  Less than a year later and just three days before the opening of his trial, George Jackson was shot to death by a tower guard inside San Quentin Prison in an alleged escape attempt. Some people called it an assassination and “No Black person,” wrote James Baldwin, “will ever believe that George Jackson died the way they tell us he did.”  The two surviving Soledad Brothers, Clutchette and Drumgoole, were acquitted by a San Francisco jury."

blackladies,3cifrf,Monty44863,20,Wed Jul 8 03:56:22 2015 UTC,"My father is black.  He was adopted by a white family. My mother is white.  I grew up in Colorado.  Zero black people.  A very small amount of Hispanics but it was seriously something like 98% white.  My father never really developed an identity as a black person, he left Colorado and moved to a place where black people exist when he was 50.  He is really uncomfortable and awkward and his only references to black culture are from like awful films from the 70's he calls them sistas and brothas and he's just super out of touch it is embarrassing but also painful.  I always knew I was not white and wanted to embrace that.  But like my father, I had no reference of what it is to be black outside of popular culture, which in my time meant hip hop.  I moved to NYC at age 18 and was pretty determined to be this hard thug, I deliberately chose the worst neighborhoods to live in and got myself into a whole lot of trouble.  I was authentically black just like all the rappers I grew up listening to and I loved it  Once I grew up I moved past that phase, I saw black professional people and understood that they're just people, it's not a role I have to play.  I still love hip hop and it's the only place I find people expressing my thoughts and my experiences.  It's very important to me.  My mother is always reminding me that I'm white, that I don't have to talk like that, that the police aren't out to get law abiding citizens, etc.  Every example of racism ive faced in my life is immediately dismissed by her and I can't even bother with it anymore and find myself getting further and further away from her. My father just quietly goes through life the way he always does, careful not to draw too much attention to himself.  I can talk about racial issues with him and he is aware of them and how they affect him, but he is really careful not to rock the boat and upset my mother in her utopia where color doesn't matter and all that nonsense.  This is very frustrating and heartbreaking and I have to distance myself from him too because it makes me sad.  I am almost 30 years old and I wouldn't say I've found my identity.  I was comfortable in New York, but a few years ago I moved to Florida where there's an entirely different black culture and my skin has gotten much darker from the sun it's like being a completely different person.  Still I'm aware that I have some white privilege and know how to use it to my advantage when necessary.  I'm raising two black sons now, I'm determined to live in black communities, expose them to black people and just make blackness part of them instead of something they have to look outward to find"

There's a tight community of people who have been here for generations and people seem to all be the same.  This is all oversimplified generalization of course, but you don't see the same kind of individual expression that you do in New York.  The older people were around when it was segregated and you can see the lasting effects of government that never made social services a priority.

My nuclear family was really inclusive and open-minded about culture in general; they were way into learning, and encouraged me to learn about all peoples. That love of learning really led me to hardcore gobble up the info on Black history and culture that was (finally) made available to me in college.   My mom is white, but in some ways I would consider her...I dunno, culturally Black? I mean, she's not Dolezal-deluded or anything, but she grew up with, and was sheltered by, Black families, and in some ways she identifies with them, even though she doesn't identify as them. If that makes sense. My mom is about as post-racial as you can actually reasonably be in America.   She's had kind of a hard time with the stark fact that she and I are of different races. She's my mom; she sees no line of division between us because we are not only blood, but I'm damn near a carbon copy of her, physically, except for color and a few other minor things. She's been supportive, though."

Not to make her sound bad or anything, she did her best to provide for me and my sister growing up and for the most part just seemed very ignorant about things when it came to black history and black hair.   Living in England my mother took me to places like Russian prep schools (where I felt I didn't belong) and pretty much surrounded me with European and Estonian culture because she wanted me to know about my (white) roots. Naturally because of this I grew up for the longest time thinking I was white Estonian and then when I got to secondary school I realized I was mixed. Then I made friends with a lot of Caribbean people and thought for the longest time that I was a Jamaican mix to the point where I started teaching myself patwa. Then when I turned 17 my father tried to get in contact with my sister and my mom drops the Nigerian deception bombshell and I had a mild identity crisis. I think my family could have told me slightly more about my Black heritage growing up."
blackladies,3cifrf,Pornacia,8,Wed Jul 8 13:49:18 2015 UTC,"Grew up in Europe with only my white mother. She was mildly active in making sure I at least connected with my Puerto Rican side, as such, I'm the only person in my generation in my family that speaks Spanish, all of my cousins on that side are white [passing] and do not speak the language nor know anything of the culture.   Every year I went to school overseas but every summer I spent either in the Caribbean or in the Carolinas with family. There was never really any cultural aim to this other than ""family.""   Really, I starting figuring out my [ethnic] identity through the ESL kids in my schools, children of other immigrant families. People tend to take culture and subculture norms for granted but the immigrant kids were all very excited to exchange ideas and practices and there was never a sense of ""cool vs uncool"" or any kind of exclusion because no one was anything alike at all. As long as you were nice, that was all that mattered. My freshman year of high school, our little crew rolled pretty deep. The make-up of that group would end up being par for the majority of my social life after that:   Jamaican Ecuadorian x2 Filipino x2 Black American x3 White x2 Chinese Viet Eritrean Pakistani x2 a few mixed kids   I bring these up under the heading of family because my home life was a wreck. Father was m.i.a. half the time, mother was single and traveled for work a lot, and later the whole thing fell apart and I became homeless, with father on ghost mode and mother in and out of jail. So these friends' families became my families, they all took me in in turns. I lived with 3 different Filipino families over the years, a few black homes, lived with my Chinese bff and her fam and moved to HK with them for a little while, my white Podunk godmother took me in a lot when my mother was away.    So, I mean, I'm multi-ethnic and had an even more diverse ""home"" life than I can account for by blood. And it's pretty cool. My partner now is Filipino but of a trans racial adoption, so he's been kinda of disconnected from his heritage in that regard. But it's pretty cool because even though I'm not Pinay, I can help him get back to a little bit. We use Tagalish and Spanglish in the home. He also grew up in Europe, so there's a fair bit of French and German around the home too."

They routinely bash Black women and cape for abusers and racist whites to no end but because they don't say they are conservative or Republican (even though their views are quite reactionary) they get a pass.   Sadly that comment from the article reminds me of some of the assholes I grew up with.

Also, extensions and weaves are thousands of years old  and are in just about EVERY civilized culture originating in gasp! ""Mother Africa"".  That makes Hotep extra stuck-on stupid.

I would have been two steps away from telling them to shut the fuck up lol  I love love LOVE braids. They have helped my hair grow and stay secure more than any other style. I love how professional and intricate they look too...They are basically art!  I am tired of these black people who just feel a compulsion to police black women's bodies.    After that a Hotep-ish guy added some rant about wanting to find ""authentic"" black women who were proud of who they are,    We all know this is what an ""authentic"" black woman looks like to the Hotep..lol!"

blackladies,3cgo39,Actipissed,7,Wed Jul 8 13:20:22 2015 UTC,"First of all is your hair, you bought it. Second tell them to enjoy the view or keep it moving. Do you what makes you feel good. I have a sew in right now for the first time since high school and I love it. I put Marley twists often. When I first went natural, I didn't straighten, I didn't do straight weaves, I felt like I had to prove to myself that I could be comfortable with who I Ammon default. Okay did that. Check. Now I'm gonna do whatever the fuck I want with my head and its its nobody else goddamn business. I'm sorry you're getting this from people who are supposed to be supporting you. Create a forcefield and deflect all that nonsense. Also what kind of lame would dare come at you for wearing braids in the summer. steups"
blackladies,3cgo39,leftblane,7,Tue Jul 7 23:46:51 2015 UTC,"These people are really misconstruing the whole natural hair thing. I really like the whole natural hair celebration that's happening with black women because there does tend to be a lot of negative ideas attached to black people's range of hair textures. That being said, its part of black hair and wide spread African culture to braid hair. That being said celebrating black hair doesn't have to be a limitation on black women. We're still allowed to try different hair styles and colors just like any other race of women."
blackladies,3cgo39,lottikey,5,Wed Jul 8 00:47:40 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry those folks came at you with that nonsense. I stay in braided or twisted extensions because it's easier for me on a day-to-day basis. Plus it's fun to switch up my hair. I do my own hair primarily so it's usually some type of twists that I rock. (I haven't mastered the ability to do braided extensions.) I really want some box braids with the long, loose, wispy ends or some in a bob a la Maxine Shaw from Living Single."
blackladies,3cgo39,_Liquorice_,3,Tue Jul 7 20:52:49 2015 UTC,"WTH? They came after you over braids?  BRAIDS?  They couldn't be anymore dense, could they?  Next it's shaming black women for dyeing their hair a slightly different shade of brown or black (LOL)...really.    Before college, I always had in braids or straight hairstyles.  My mom is very bad with her thinking of natural hair and it obviously shows through since she dictated how my hair would be styled and it was always the same things.  I got tired of regular, medium-sized, three-strand braids (does this have a special name?) and they were painful because my mom doesn't have a gentle bone in her body and I'm pretty tender-headed.  Was forced to get relaxers, had weaves twice or thrice in my life.  Anyway, when I left home I could finally do what I wanted and it's been almost 5/6 years without braids and damn I miss it so much now.  I want to try all the braids.  I want to get chunky twists next.  Bantu Knots are so cool, but my face is weird for it unless I try sectioning it much smaller...or much larger than what I had before (which was my first time, woot!).  Ooh and box braids as well!  But money... :(    OK rambling...uh either way, braids are beautiful. Like what?  This is like the blackest thing ever and super natural, they assume all braiding is with fake hair extensions, uh no.  There's real human hair extensions.  XD There's also just braiding the hair that comes out of your hair.  There's braiding with yarn.  Braiding with clay/mud, probably something else too.  LOL  I'm seriously baffled with their reasoning, last I check folks aren't chemically manipulating their hair by braiding it.  So wearing a ponytail or a bun isn't natural?  It's all just moving hair around on the hair.    she claimed that braids and weaves are the same thing if you use fake hair   I agree with this.  Again not all braiding uses extra hair besides the one on your head, who cares anyway.  Surprised a natural chick is saying shit about braids...how is she keeping length?  What is her secret?"
blackladies,3cgo39,Cammadore64,2,Wed Jul 8 05:06:52 2015 UTC,"Braids are a great protective style. You just braid your hair and then moisturize often..that's it, so it's a great way to kind of ""forget"" about your hair.  Weaves are great for protective styling as well. I only wear them in the summer, then weaves in the winter, but there are plenty of women who wear them year round.   Your friend is very misguided and I wouldn't expect anything better from a hotep. Most people's hair grows better when it is manipulated for styling, which why people get braids and weaves. I guess black women can't do anything besides wear our natural hair colors in our natural textures- all the time. Experimenting with colors and textures is strictly forbidden and only for non-black women, right?"
blackladies,3cgo39,misskay44,2,Wed Jul 8 02:32:59 2015 UTC,"Wow your friend sounds like a jerk. My fiancee recently got braids and she looks absolutely amazing! But she had them removed in favor of a straight weave because we're visiting my family in South Carolina and she's afraid of looking ""too black"" in the deep south :("
blackladies,3cgvbi,IrbyTremor,-8,Tue Jul 7 20:28:29 2015 UTC,"So the only proof they have is the women bringing it up? What, no rape kits? No actual physical proof, just word of mouth?  Sure, people buy drugs/alcohol with the intention of sex afterwards. NO I am not saying that it's okay to have sex with someone who is passed out. BUT it seems the word of these women trumps everything. Did they know they were going to have sex afterwards? Why did they dismiss the only Black woman who came forward? Why are all of these White women taken word for word?  Why are they bringing this up now?  My guess is because there's money involved.   Notice whenever an issue involving Black people's treatment in this country, the media trots out these stories in order go get riled up. Meanwhile white people continue to stick up for people like The Duggars, Jared Fogle(the Subway Spokesperson) and his affinity for child porn catholic priests, and any famous person who did something heinous and was able to continue walking around like nothing happened.   As for me, I'm not really going to give Bill Cosby that much attention. But I will say this. America has a rape culture, but they're trying to attach this to Black men while ignoring the fact that White slave masters raped Black women, and White women used Black men by having sex with them and claiming rape, or just claiming rape without sex whenever they don't get their way.  Yes. Bill is creepy, and I'm still mad at him for talking all of that shit about Black people and morality. And I'm extra mad at him for talking that mess and having the nerve to be creepy like this as if creepiness doesn't have anything to do with morality. But that doesn't diminish his achievements. I still like A Different World, and The Cosby Show still has a place in my heart. I grew up with Fat Albert. Thanks to his shows, the 90s became an era for great Black TV. That in itself deserves acknowledgement and should not be sullied.  That's how they get us. They put out disparaging information about a Black person with money so we can say ""Oh no he/she didn't. I will not support them anymore!"" Meanwhile, they put out some shows for us and they collect our money after taking that  money from the celebrity, or any Black person who does very well for themselves. They'll do it via lawsuit, paparazzi, or by any kind of defamation they can get away with.   That's how they move."

The only issue here is it only made the news when white women spoke up about it.   So I dont agree with a word of this. I hate that ""They just want to take down our perfect Black Patriarch"" shit. Sorry but no.  And Bill is wildly anti-Black. ""They"" have fuck all to do with this. He's a piece of shit and no conspiracy or conjecture is going to rescue him for that.  You're reaching."

I'm just saying that I still like his shows, and the achievement is something despite what he did.   I did say that I am still mad at him for talking all of that shit about Black people.    I did say that rape is wrong and waiting until a person passes out to have sex with them is NOT okay.   But I just find it interesting that this is all of a sudden in the spotlight again. Why did all of this come out just now? I still think something is up with that.  I never said he was ""our perfect Black Patriarch"".  Not even once."
blackladies,3cgvbi,meadeater2014,17,Wed Jul 8 00:59:59 2015 UTC,But you're not hearing me. Its not all of a sudden. Women have been saying these things for years and years. It's only just now blowing up because Hannibal Burress said something in his stand up and white victims made it sensational  But its been happening and spoken about for ages. People just chose to ignore the victims  Even Burress was saying its all over the internet. Look it up. He set off the storm.
blackladies,3cgvbi,meadeater2014,-4,Wed Jul 8 01:42:10 2015 UTC,"But its been happening and spoken about for ages. People just chose to ignore the victims   I remember back when the very first accusations happened before Hannibal Burress brought it up. But it fell on deaf ears. Honestly, I wonder why it was ignored instead of dealt with back then? I believe that's when it should have been addressed. What happened between then and Hannibal refreshing everyone's memory?"

blackladies,3cgvbi,meadeater2014,2,Wed Jul 8 04:11:51 2015 UTC,I understand. Sorry about that.  And yeah. Just because somebody plays a wholesome character on TV doesn't mean they're not a piece of shit in real life.

blackladies,3cgvbi,meadeater2014,3,Wed Jul 8 13:50:56 2015 UTC,"I do. And I retract what I said, and I accept any downvotes because of it.  It was ignored because nobody believed the women before. Apparently he had been to court over the entire thing before. I just never heard about it. All I heard was the accusations.   I'm sorry for offending anybody regarding this situation. I'd still like to question why was a 15 year old at the playboy mansion, and why isn't Hugh Hefner under investigation for allowing 15 and 16 year old girls at his home?  It reminds me of the McMartin preschool trial where the kids said they were molested and nobody believed them.  After reading more on the Bill Cosby fiasco, it may open a new door to what really goes on with these people.  I think Bill is part of something bigger. Not to take away from what's going on with Bill though, I just think his situation is a small piece of the puzzle."

The part that I really disliked was when she says, ""and look what has happened to him"" I wish she hadn't said that.   I think she wanted to inspire him to change his ways, but I see why you feel she's being heartless. Her smiling may seem smug, though that wasn't my interpretation.

The only thing that has changed in the increase of the perceived victim-hood.  Well on second thought maybe not. The premise behind the KKK of the 60s (and the use of the Confederate flag) was the Civil Rights Movement was ""taking"" something away from them, and they were leading the fight to ""take it back.""

blackladies,3cdm90,8__,4,Tue Jul 7 15:14:55 2015 UTC,"It is quite sad. The man who played a wholesome character on television and taught kids to not use drugs, taught men to respect women, and taught women that they deserve respect is the same man who off-set was drugging and raping women. But it's very important to remember that Bill Cosby is not Cliff Huxtable. And it's probably okay to go on loving the character of Cliff Huxtable while having... quite negative feelings... about Bill Cosby. Huxtable was created by a set of writers, and not just Cosby himself."
blackladies,3cdm90,eroverton,4,Tue Jul 7 18:50:24 2015 UTC,"I think that claiming people were confusing Bill Cosby with Cliff Huxtable is a bit of an oversimplification; I've never liked that claim because it assumes that anyone who thought that this thing might not be true is just really, really stupid. I suppose some did, but that's not the only reason to have been skeptical.  Consider - Bill Cosby has fought for Black excellence and self-respect, not only through playing that character but the creation of shows like A Different World, Little Bill (which to this day is the best children's animation for Black children I've seen yet), his support in advocating for and promoting higher education for our youth, HBCUs in particular, strong Black family units, cultural pride... even his piece from the 70s on the mis-education of Black children spoke of someone deeply committed to helping our people. All of these things paint a picture of a man who is committed to using his platform to benefit and uplift the Black family.  Add to that the very real history of white women falsely claiming rape in order to assassinate the character of a Black man seen as getting above himself - or to create an excuse for action against our communities - and knowing the utter destruction that such claims has caused to us - even to this day the 'say a Black man did it' game goes on and results in Very Bad Things for us.  I admit, I was very skeptical. Those things put together, along with the strangeness of the stories coming to light made it seem fishy. I am not one to automatically assume rape claims are false, nor am I inclined to believe the accused over the accuser. I know how much sexual assault happens and goes unreported and unbelieved. But it seemed at odds with the character of the man - not his TV character but his body of work. It seemed like a character assassination on us as a group, in true 'white-woman-cries-rape' tradition... a way of trying to put forth the notion that even the most ""respectable"" of the negroes is a rapist and a criminal.  I didn't assume he was innocent. But with all that in mind, I wasn't willing to jump on the 'guilty just because people say so' wagon either. And I really really hoped it wasn't true, because I had a lot of respect for the man and his career. But I failed to remember that even the most upstanding-seeming guy can hide a creepy pervy creep, so more fool me. :-/"

Maybe he shouldn't have maliciously drugged and raped a whole bunch of women who have had to live for decades with the heavy, horrible feelings that come from being violated like that and also feeling powerless to get justice or stop it from happening again because the man who did it to them is too powerful, and also having people not only not believe them about their own terrible experience, but demean and attack them as well?   This isn't something that happened to him, it's something he repeatedly did to a whole bunch of women (and to himself, by extension), with forethought and planning and malicious intent. And he lied about it, and continued to enjoy a wonderful reputation and career and a lot of love and adoration when in reality he is a disgusting predator. That's who he truly is, and he betrayed everyone who loved him as a media figure or a role model because he pulled the wool over everyone's eyes while blatantly going about raping women. And then he hid behind that reputation--that same love the public has had for him--when he was rightly accused. He let the public add insult to injury to these women, picking up torches and pitchforks to further shame and attack them, and sat back riding along on the strength of his reputation.   (And it wasn't until a man said something about it that people actually started to wonder if maybe these women weren't just lying about being raped--that's a whole 'nother level of fucked up.)  Fa real doe, maybe we can feel bad for the public for exactly what you said--the embarrassment and sadness of losing someone they looked up to. But he could have stopped this from happening at any time by, y'know...not raping women."

blackladies,3ceb1b,wafflebread,4,Tue Jul 7 06:17:51 2015 UTC,"Avoided? Umm maybe making the Black women surrounding the young lady, in the story one dimensional. It really disheartens me to see a wonderful cast with a terrible plot or non-complex characters.   Or avoiding the whole sapphire type characters, mammy characters, women who are really angry for no reason."
blackladies,3ceb1b,lovelyone20,6,Tue Jul 7 09:51:47 2015 UTC,"Robots.  But also... that's a really broad question. I'm not sure how well one could answer that without more details. I'm thinking of one particular story I'm working on that centers around black women as the main characters. One of them was sexually abused as a child, a lot of her time coming of age involves trying to feel safe, secure, and sane. It's made worse by having to live her teenage years in a white neighborhood with a white stepfather. A different character is a woman who was adopted by a marine mother and soldier father. Her struggles are about what it means to be family and eventually being able to carve a place in the predominately masculine and white military for a black woman. Both these characters fit the bill of being black and being girls, but have vastly different experiences. Experiences I hope, at least, would be considered realistic. Both of whom also take bits and pieces of my own experience (I remember how disappointed my Samoan uncle was that I joined the army instead of Marines. I can only imagine if it were my mother.)  I guess my input would be to keep it grounded. But not to be afraid to use your own life for inspiration. I'd hate to use a white man as an example, but it's the best one I can think of at the moment. Comedian Christopher Titus, total hard ass. But we know why he's a hard ass, because his father was. And he said once that his comedy grew by leaps and bounds because he stopped telling corny jokes and just started opening up about how painful his life was growing up and the abuse he went through.  Now, maybe you've never been molested or joined the military. Maybe nothing terrible or exciting in your life has ever happened. To that I'd say, look at that new movie Inside Out. All that really happened was a little girl moved to a new city. It's hardly dramatic in of itself, but even simple things can become powerful when you spin it.  Thinking about it, it's also a broad question in terms of what your goal is. If your goal is to give crusty old white guys in politics an eye opener in how black girls are treated, that's going to be written differently than if you want to give young black girls an escapist fantasy where they can feel empowered."
blackladies,3ceb1b,AliceHouse,4,Tue Jul 7 09:53:58 2015 UTC,"Personally I enjoy movies that ""DONT"" need a romance to progress the plot of story, I cannot tell you how irritating Avengers AOU was because they just had to put Black Widow and Hulk romance BS. Movies need to be like Pacific Rim and Mad Max: Fury Road, they had the element that in order to survive you can ""need"" help and friends to make it, but to have the Male/Female get all romantic because they are forced to make the story interesting is plain lazy.  And now to answer your question, I'm a HUGE anime/manga fan, there is a massive list of strong female protagonist, the #1 in most fans mind is Motoko Kusanagi http://imgur.com/65h2KVF she is the most bad ass of bad ass females in anime/manga not because she can kick ass and take names(which she does) but because she has intelligence, class, and is a natural born leader. If they can channel that then you got yourself a good character."

I'm asexual and perhaps aromantic, so although I enjoy romantic comedies from time to time, they feel very foreign. Speaking of asexuality, if there is a romantic sub-plot, I think an exploration of queerness would be awesome. Popular narratives on LGBTQ people tend to focus on cis white boys/men, so a story about a queer black girl could change things up even just a little bit.  When I was a wee /u/fangbian I was not only the only Black kid in my elementary class, but also a huge nerd. Kids at my after-school program and middle school would harass me for it. I felt isolated. As ar as I knew, very little media about nerdy black girls existed (this was the early- and mid-2000s) and I didn't know how to navigate the world around me without the external guidelines and validation that other kids had. Thankfully more books and cartoons have Black characters these days, but the gap remains.  tl;dr: queer, nerdy Black girls pls"

What was it that affected their economy?? Hmm....  But the part that really got to me was when she started acting like I was blaming HER for slavery (this is the 2nd time this has happened with her, last time she cried smh) and she started getting an attitude stating how she is annoyed by the story of how my grandfather died.  My grandfather died in the 50's because he was beaten to death by a group of white men for being a Black man with a ""white man job"". I've only told her this story once, its not like I always bring it up...and she said that "" it doesn't matter why he died, why does that matter to you? He's dead. Why do you have to bring up that he died because he was black? Why do you have to bring race up into it?"" We hardly even talk about race or our family, so I'm not even sure why she takes these things personally, like I'm blaming her for these things.

She feels uncomfortable talking about race. Fine. Deal with that internally and don't try to force me to forget my real lived and family history to coddle your pathetic little feelings.

This time when I went in my hairstylist felt that I wasn't taking good enough care of the fluffier weave and switched me to a straighter style. I wasn't happy, I prefer the fluffier weave cause it makes me look I have thicker hair and matches more with me being plus sized. I came home upset and tried to explain this to my German husband. He didn't get it and walked away to the den, saying that he was annoyed. I became even more upset but didn't flip out. I spoke to him about how I was feeling and then feeling like he wasn't listening to me and trying to comfort me or anything.  I know, I know, such first world and middle class problems. So petty and minor in relation to everything else that is happening but having that hair makes me feel pretty, it makes me feel feminine. As a fat woman for decades who's been in primarily white environments for school and work, I don't often get to feel feminine or attractive.

blackladies,3ceasv,BaxterTheMaester,3,Wed Jul 8 06:10:37 2015 UTC,"Oh.my.god.  So I've raged on about this in the other threads.  One big thing that hit me right in the beginning of May that almost had me shattered for good is that I couldn't keep the apartment because my roommate (would have been my cousin) bailed.  It was the plan since the start of the year...even a bit of December that we would move in together once my first lease was up.  My old roommate (guess who introduced us) was terrible: extremely messy, childish, late on the rent a few times, had her boyfriend practically live there, almost burned down the apartment (wish I was exaggerating) and many more.  The only reason she could keep the place was because she could move in with her boyfriend.  What do I find out yesterday?  Not only is my cousin living with her parents this summer (important to note since she insisted I tag along with another person again (fuck no) and if not then she will just team up with them which was the worst part).  But plans to do so for the next semester so she will be commuting to school....GIRL.  You know how hard it was to not say I TOLD YOU SO.  Ugh.  I stopped talking to her two months ago because she pulled that shit.  She's not some random relative either (not close with family except my sisters), we were like this.  She went and been stupid with some chick and now look where she's at.  I kind of want to offer again...but I think I should just continue with my plans of getting a studio instead.  She needs to learn her lesson.  Originally us two at the start.  Tried to wedge in her then-current dorm roommate.  Insisted that it had to work that way and she wouldn't bend back.  I offered to house her things or have her move in with me right before my lease was up since she was worried about the gap (she wanted a place with that girl June 1st while my lease wasn't up until next month).  So many other bullshit reasons only to hear she's going to stay with her mother when my aunt gets back from Ghana.  Pfft."

The French state suffered for decades under this debt. The history of public debt is full of irony. It rarely follows our ideas of order and justice."
blackladies,3cdd8b,IrbyTremor,6,Tue Jul 7 01:11:17 2015 UTC,This is amazing. Germany also has a big hypocrisy for ragging on other states for racist/ethnocentric extremism at that. Thry pretend to be well past Nazism which sadly is so not the case.

blackladies,3cbr7a,RaHxRaH,17,Mon Jul 6 19:16:15 2015 UTC,"Not to the same degree I don't think...especially as more of ""their own"" come out. There's just so much more for the most normalized in the U.S. to have in common with homosexual people (at least White ones) than there is Black. They might have a gay cousin or child or uncle who shares a good amount of their values, traditions, music, prejudices etc. I think homosexual folk who marry/aspire to marry will integrate pretty smoothly actually, especially White ones with money and children...especially as America ""browns"". They'll follow the path of the Irish more than Black people I think.  Once they realize that Whiteness can be supported by gay people, most of them will be won over.    Edit: I think it's going to become important to distinguish between the rights of homosexual people to conform to cultural norms vs. their general human rights. Marriage equality only touches on the former, doesn't impact all homosexuals, and still leaves general relational hierarchies untouched."
blackladies,3cbr7a,RhombusBlue,18,Mon Jul 6 19:36:58 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. White America loves to conflate legal equality with structural/systemic/lived equality, which is of course absurd. So now homophobia and its effects are more easily denied (""but you can marry!""), just like after the civil rights movement.  But it is much different from black/brown-ness because anyone's child can be LGBT, whereas phenotype is hereditary. It's harder to pin poverty and crime on LGBT culture or biology when there are LGBT people in every economic/social circumstance imaginable. Like you mentioned, having a diffuse population of LGBT people means everyone is likely to know someone LGBT. And simple exposure can make all the difference when it comes time to empathize."

blackladies,3cbr7a,KhaleesiBubblegum,7,Mon Jul 6 19:21:01 2015 UTC,"As a gay minority, yes. Just like with sexism, I honestly think that both homophobia and racism will be around forever in people's minds. And even worse, it'll be the kind of homophobia that's institutionalized, where straights start feeling like their ""rights are being violated"" for the gays.  I'm glad that LGBT voices are being heard and that rights are pushing towards the positive, but so many people still hate. So many people still choose to be ignorant and fearful."
blackladies,3cbr7a,Protanope,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:53:34 2015 UTC,"where straights start feeling like their ""rights are being violated"" for the gays.   It's funny because that's already started with the ""flying the pride flag is an attack on my Christian values"" nonsense."
blackladies,3cbr7a,Cammadore64,3,Fri Jul 10 13:51:54 2015 UTC,"The problem with race is that it doesn't even take hatred of another race... you can create segregation merely by having a mild preference towards being around your own race.  Few people thinks it's racist to not want to be the only white family on the block, but that's all it takes before you get segregation which leads to a complete lack of exposure.  On the other hand, millennial parents will have gay children and nephews and high school friends and exs and the sheer mundaneness of being gay will slowly dominate the culture.  In addition, it's much harder to tell if your coworkers sexuality than her race, so people will get to know other people and then be confronted with their gender.  That goes a long way to demanding acceptance.  It's easy to hate the ""other"" who you don't know and never bothered to interact with.  It's harder (though sadly still possible) to hate your own flesh and blood.  I am not as optimistic for trans people.  I actually don't know what the endgame for trans people actually is.  It seems like there's a wide spectrum between people who want to be genderqueer/agender or otherwise flaunt against the norms, and those who want to fully and completely transition and pass perfectly.  I believe trans people aren't going to attain equality until they can both be accepted for being nonbinary and be accepted into their new binary gender, if they decide to switch 100%, and that assumes that access to the medical services required to make the switch is available to those who are poor."
blackladies,3cbr7a,successfulblackwoman,2,Tue Jul 7 03:34:44 2015 UTC,"I am not as optimistic for trans people.    Truth. I think the gay-straight deal works because it maintains a binary, and people are comfortable with that."
blackladies,3cbr7a,RhombusBlue,2,Tue Jul 7 13:36:44 2015 UTC,"This is a commonly held belief from political queers. While I support gay marriage an incremental step toward some semblance of equality, it's not actual equality."
blackladies,3cbr7a,matsie,2,Tue Jul 7 00:23:59 2015 UTC,"Yep. I said it here before but marriage equality is the low-hanging fruit of LGBT rights. There's no legitimate arguments against it and even apathetic people figure that it's only fair for gays to marry as well. If you introduce movements like standing for transgender healthcare coverage or covering gay/lesbian issues in sex ed class, support is going to dwindle as people come out thinking 'that shits cosmetic why should I pay for their fake pussy' or 'eww buttsex, gays are gross'.  It's not as cool to be a LGBT activist as it was a month ago. Sure some will still do it but the trenders will find a new trend. There are obvious parallels to the civil rights movement."

blackladies,3ccevs,wafflebread,10,Tue Jul 7 00:33:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The problem is racism is a multi-tentacled monster pervading:   Education Criminal Justice Housing Politics   Different people both white and black have used different niche approaches to cutting off some arms of the octopus, but conservative and racist groups are always usually hard at work trying to regain lost ground.  We've advanced since the 1960's, and racists know that. Anti-discrimination lawsuits, innovations like race statistics, social media and camera-phones have allowed us to get our message out louder, but we need the political power to enact changes now, and we still lack it beyond the president (who is only just one part of the government).  So we have a black president now, and the administration has done a few things:   Won large settlements/agreements from banks channeling predatory mortgages to black communities before the 2008 recession Extended health insurance to many low-income black and brown people Close to commuting sentences for many non-violent drug offenders (many of whom black/latino)   So we're starting to make some progress, but average black people need to realize in the first place that a real war against them is still going on, and they need to fight back. And this starts on the local level, even the average argument with racist Redditors really counts, because hundreds of people might be watching but not upvoting/downvoting.  We have some sense that things are unequal, and we riot and make platitudes about change, but often don't even follow up by getting organized politically to actually change it. The black voting participation rate in Ferguson was 6%! Is it any surprise the police force wasn't friendly to black communities?"

I've personally always thought that anti-racism has a lot in common with the green movement, and that started with people divesting from the system in practical ways , proving there was another way to live, then making it ""cool"". Kinda just rambling here, but I'm thinking it'll be pretty challenging to find people, even POC who are willing to walk that walk, mostly because it's all really about power and dominance. If you don't get people in a position where they're comfortable being servants by choice and using their power for others, they'll just endlessly cycle through different areas of dominance and kyriarchy will survive.  IMO, It's not so much about the causes of racism as it is about why people are ok with it in the first place."

She's 16; this is the age when individuals naturally gravitate away from whatever defines their home life in order to try to establish an identity that feels like theirs, and not one that was imposed upon them. So they take up with what their peers are doing and identify with that more than their home life. They start to look at how the world ""really"" is, based on their own limited observations and understanding of what's important and what motivates people. So they get it twisted.   Which is not to downplay the very real issues that are present here. She's no doubt getting a lot of negative messages from her peers, feeling isolated, and as /u/supcaci put it, undateable. I went through the same thing in high school--I was the only brown kid in most of my Honors/AP classes, so I was always around the ""rich"" white kids in my town, none of whom could have possibly accepted me (yay the South). So when I went away to college in a more progressive area, I was shocked and confused that anyone found me attractive. Like, ""Does not compute.""  But then that illusion shattered, and I started learning more about our history, and being surrounded by positive role models. It was a struggle to throw off all that foolishness, but because I felt I had arrived there on my own, and not because I was told how to think, it stuck."
blackladies,3ca1h0,multirachael,2,Mon Jul 6 11:29:45 2015 UTC,"That makes complete sense, I felt a lot of the same isolation from my peers and in general because I'm from the city and I went to boarding school in the middle of the woods. I also had feelings of being undatable and I didn't have my first boyfriend until my freshman year in college.   The difference between us I think was our personalities and our relationship with our grandmother. I just didn't give a shit about what people said about my blackness. She takes things to heart and holds grudges.   My grandmother, although not very progressive, occasionally rude unintentionally, and old fashioned, plays a more influential role in my life. We have a more emotionally close relationship because she pretty much raised me. With my sister, my mom stepped up to the plate more so she doesn't have the kind of deep emotional relationship with a strong black role model. Of course she knows what my grandmother has had to endure and respects her, but she probably feels like she doesn't have someone close to talk to about her feelings about herself like I did. I want to be able to be that person but I know how hard it is to open up when we grew up with a narcissistic mother who ignored and demeaned emotional expression."
blackladies,3ca1h0,multirachael,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:12:10 2015 UTC,"Lawd, lawd...I know dat feel, sis. :/  My sibs and I had a tumultuous home life; it wasn't until later that we became really close, but now we're inseparable best friends. Just keep being there for her, consistently, and she may eventually feel able to open up."
blackladies,3ca1h0,supcaci,9,Mon Jul 6 22:16:47 2015 UTC,"The first thing that came to mind for me is that she is probably feeling the sting of beauty standards in particular because of the fact that she's in high school and feeling like she's undateable in that milieu. I would subtly start sharing images of dark skinned beauty with her. Are you two on Instagram or Pinterest? I'd start following black beauty/fashion bloggers/accounts/boards and start sharing images with her, or something like that, with comments like, ""Ooh, check out that hairstyle!"" Or stuff like that. Exposure creates familiarity and people do eventually develop a preference for what is most familiar. Also, maybe getting some style ideas from people who have similar hair and skin to her could help her come up with some new looks that would give her confidence, which is key. All of this is stemming from insecurity, so perhaps that's one avenue for fixing some of her self-image problems."
blackladies,3ca1h0,wannaridebikes,2,Mon Jul 6 10:56:24 2015 UTC,We are on Instagram! I do follow a few ladies who are fashion bloggers and some who do beautiful hairstyles for 4c hair. A few of them are African with a range of complexions and some are black American women. A lot of black travel bloggers too. I'll start sharing them with her more!
blackladies,3ca1h0,RhombusBlue,2,Mon Jul 6 15:01:24 2015 UTC,There's a lot on tumblr too. That platform seems to be the best if she has a short attention span like a lot of her generation would have. It really requires zero effort (outside of finding people to follow) if you just want to reblog images.
blackladies,3ca1h0,RhombusBlue,6,Mon Jul 6 17:31:05 2015 UTC,"I can say from personal experience that a Black family isn't enough. Children need exposure to non-familial Black social groups to have their appearance and beauty feel normalized...that's one of the big reasons I'm glad I was raised early in a Black church.   She might be a bit old to make massive, elemental changes in her perception of Blackness, but she's beyond old enough to know how not to say hurtful things, especially about children. I'm sure...positive she's had things said about her at school and is probably just passing them on. Maybe it'd be worth having a conversation with her about how she's allowed to speak to your children (or how she has some responsibility in them growing up happy and healthy) while being open with her that you're raising them to love who they are and how they look and not be so sold on White standards of beauty."
blackladies,3ca1h0,RhombusBlue,2,Mon Jul 6 14:05:39 2015 UTC,I spoke to her this morning about how she addressed my son and she apologized and said that she didn't mean for it to be hurtful and that she won't do it again.   We were raised in a black church as well but I was far more involved as a young girl than she was when she was younger. We moved a lot further away and my mom doesn't particularly like church anyway so she made no effort to get my sister involved. That had to be organized by my grandmother. Maybe getting her involved in the church again might help.
blackladies,3ca1h0,lottikey,2,Mon Jul 6 15:16:27 2015 UTC,"That's so tricky...like...I completely understand not wanting to get involved with church just to be around Black people, but it's the easiest solution to the cultural exposure question. But who knows...maybe she'll get into it.   Cool that she apologized...at the very least maybe it'll get her thinking about that, and even who her classmates are if they've done/said similar things."
blackladies,3ca1h0,RhombusBlue,6,Mon Jul 6 15:46:03 2015 UTC,"I certainly hope so. Especially being from LA where if you accuse someone of being racist they get so defensive because they're just so progressive and colorblind and perfect but here, live up to white standards of beauty or you're not pretty."

blackladies,3ca1h0,wannaridebikes,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:11:47 2015 UTC,Good point. Very true.
blackladies,3ca1h0,lottikey,3,Tue Jul 7 01:07:33 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, you just have to be blunt and throw the truth of what a person is saying back at them so they can confront it, especially if it's someone you love.  I think this is one of those instances.   If this were a grown stranger, I'd be more prone to smh in pity and keep it moving,  but I wouldn't just assume rebellion.  This isn't a matter of blue hair and smoking some herb.  Self-hatred is a lot more toxic to the psyche and should not be allowed to just be with hopes to simply sort itself out.  She could do a lot of damage to herself and others in that journey and she may not even have that journey back to loving herself  (see: Michele Malkin).  I find that questions are the best tactic.  The next time she says dark-skin is ugly or nappy hair isn't good hair, question the specific reasons why that is.  It ALWAYS eventually comes down to it's not white.  Deconstruct the fact that her praising what she isn't and can never be and what the means she's saying about her own self.  And most importantly, be honest, loving, make sure she understands that she can come to you about not feeling like she fits and can't live up to white standards without shaming.  Don't talk down to her about it.  I think stories and articles from black women who have gone through where she is would also be helpful.  Finally, give her and black beauty all the praise and love.  Talk about how melanin is protecting and makes our skin set-off colorful clothing.  Talk about the reasons why body-builders tan their skin and that fact that it sets off the beauty of the body's definition.     Talk about how the only ethnic group on this planet with our uniquely pliable and versatile hair texture is black people and how boring and common straight hair is.  Ask her if her ""friends"" have ever made anti-black statements around her and what that means about their so-called friendship/  I had to speak to two young cousins about similar.  Be blunt, loving, and don't talk down to her.    Question immediately when it happens, and don't let it slide again."
blackladies,3ca1h0,lottikey,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:23:36 2015 UTC,This is all amazing advice! I'll definitely get on all of that. I've been looking for events that we can go to together where she can be more exposed to the beauty of our culture without making it seem like I'm forcing her. She likes hanging out with me so hopefully she'll have fun. I'm definitely talking to her about conversations with her friends.
blackladies,3c9mc8,wisesonAC,9,Mon Jul 6 04:20:54 2015 UTC,"They tried to go after her for that, too. Bunch of white sports writers pretending to give a shit about gang violence because it gave them an excuse to stir up non-existent controversy and shit on a black woman."
blackladies,3c9mc8,hozac,2,Mon Jul 6 06:14:21 2015 UTC,WTF does gang violence have to do with her flawlessly pulling off this celebratory dance?
blackladies,3c9mc8,garnetsquarefro,2,Tue Jul 7 05:45:16 2015 UTC,"The dance she was doing was the crip walk. So - nothing really. But it's enough for pearl-clutching, racist whites looking for anything to go after her for."
blackladies,3c9af5,ptanaka,38,Mon Jul 6 02:24:42 2015 UTC,"Just because I may not agree with her, I can't deny how disgusting a lot of redditors have been especially with all the racism and sexism.  Like...let her live.  Fuck these twats who've never really been told no stirring up so much shit for hardly a good reason."
blackladies,3c9af5,lottikey,5,Mon Jul 6 06:09:54 2015 UTC,"What's really surprising to me is their vitriol aimed at her is for such bogus reasons.  Like, I'm not an Ellen Pao fan, but more because when I looked at her court case with Kleiner-Perkins I saw a woman who was more concerned with ""making things better"" for... other rich women, and who seemed to care a great deal about the money, seemingly more than ""helping women.""  It certainly felt like she was a lot less invested in helping all women and was much more interested in her personal stake and being able to win the case and be able to be viewed as a ""hero,"" without actually having to be one.  Just very much struck me as a rich, privileged woman who really only actually cared about other rich, privileged women.  I mean, of course, this is all just personal opinion, and for all I know she is a very principled woman.  Which is part of what most redditors seem to be unable to separate, their own opinion vs. the facts that are available, of which there are not a great deal.  There are a great deal of rumours and assumptions.  However, that's kind of how I've felt about her position here, too.  Doing more talking about making big changes to help people and less about actually doing it.  I do feel bad for her dealing with the harassive behavior of redditors here, but her and Ohanian have kind of dug their own graves, metaphorically, without even getting around to helping communities like this.  I wonder if they even realized how many mods really were fed up with the lack of communication and lack of useful mod tools?  While I think people losing their shit over losing Victoria is, well, absurd, given the other problems this site has, if nothing else it has brought to the forefront that the mods need more tools and more respect: things the mods here have been asking to get for a long, long time.  Let's just hope the next time someone here tries to get Ohanian to pay attention to systemic problems he doesn't just respond with:   popcorn tastes good.   At least Pao is enough of a grown-up to understand why saying something like that to the users in a public forum that you run is pretty fucking stupid.  How the hell does this guy get all this VC startup capital for things like Hipmunk and Antique Jetpack when he's really that fucking dense?  Oh yeah.  He's white and went to UVA  (wonder what secret societies got him all those connections?).  Honestly though I hope that quote haunts him the rest of his fucking career."
blackladies,3c9af5,deadaluspark,4,Mon Jul 6 15:36:35 2015 UTC,"How the hell does this guy get all this VC startup capital   The initial idea was a food delivery app but Y Combinator liked him and the other co-founder and they arrived at this ""internet front page"" idea. Like you mention, Ohanian left Reddit for some time, and wasn't around for the mainstreaming of Reddit (from a technolibertarian core audience). So there's a disconnect there, evident in the popcorn comment, which may have been fine back in 2006.  The popcorn comment was very dismissive and I believe his apology, but I find this to be more indicative of how he intends to shape Reddit (and the internet):   self-proclaimed “President of the internet” Alexis Ohanian   Unfortunately for him, there is no independent internet any more. It's fully integrated into the real world. And it's not just him, it's Reddit, Inc.'s board. They appointed Yishan Wong CEO who declared Reddit to be a ""government"" that was going to utilize its own cryptocurrency ""Reddit Notes"". When he wishes Reddit ""continue on its course to its destiny uninterrupted"", he was dead serious.  If anything, the mod situation has improved under Pao. The clarification of the ban evasion rule and addition to the ban message has helped moderators. Moderators' #1 problem is brigades, and while they're ""working on it"", Reddit has banned five harassing subreddits and instituted an anti-harassment policy. It's certainly not enough, but it's a start. And the fact that Pao isn't waxing poetic about Reddit as a virtual technolibertarian state is simply a bonus."
blackladies,3c9af5,yellowmix,25,Mon Jul 6 18:07:12 2015 UTC,"I do feel genuinely sorry for Ellen Pao. She is in the all-too-familiar position of being left to clean up after some dude's mess. The creators of this site produced an incredible resource but allowed it to be infested by the scum of the internet by permitting all kinds of deplorable content and behavior. Then they tried to monetize it but they couldn't, because a) such a significant minority of the site's users create/share content that is abhorrent to most normal people, including most advertisers and b) too many people on the site raise hell anytime any kind of a change is made, no matter how reasonable it might be. Recognizing their failure, they hired Pao hoping she could right the ship. However, after years of catering to insane man-children, Reddit is now left with an unenviable amount of the internet's most volatile users, ready to cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war  over any moves to make the site more welcoming to others (including advertisers).   I would give Pao the same advice I'd give Obama if I could. Your haters already hated you from the start, and they're going to hate you no matter what you do, so fuck 'em. Make the changes you really want to make instead of trying to placate them, because you can't placate them. In this case, that will mean, at some point, banning subreddits that promote deplorable ideas and behavior. They are the incubators of most, if not all, of this website's problems (and most of your opposition, as a bonus). They need to go in order for you to rebrand Reddit as a place where new users and advertisers can feel free to exist without being accosted by/associated with racism, misogyny, pedophilia, bestiality, etc.   Pao didn't create this problem, but I agree that she's not dealing with it fast enough. She should have just banned all those subreddits right after announcing the new policy, and the policy itself should have extended to banning content promoting or depicting violence or hate. They're already acting as if that's what she's doing, so she should just do it, purge the website of all these people, and start from there. Sure, she'll lose a few thousand users, but they'll be replaced by people whose eyeballs are of higher value to mainstream advertisers (how profitable can it be to advertise to young, angry misfits? Sounds like a waste of money to me).   And yes, I'm all for advertisers/marketers playing a bigger role on Reddit, because in certain key respects (as I've mentioned here) I think our interests are aligned. I'd like the site to remain mostly free to users, and wouldn't mind more activity on the margins of pages if that helps them to do that. Reddit has some excellent features and content, and if I could continue to enjoy them without a daily side of harassment and disgust, I'm all for whatever they need to do to make that happen.   Edit: a word"
blackladies,3c9af5,supcaci,5,Mon Jul 6 10:19:12 2015 UTC,I'm amazed how often you can sit here on the Internet and watch amazing tech solutions fall to pieces because the creators are so backwards in the area of actual human behavior. They're playing at straight up dark ages levels of social advancement.
blackladies,3c9af5,RhombusBlue,4,Mon Jul 6 17:59:47 2015 UTC,Well said!

I think a certain subsection of Redditors already hate Ellen, the Admins, and all of that, and anything that even begins to look like further impropriety, or can be cast in that light, will be doused in figurative gasoline and tossed on the bonfire of righteous indignation they're all dancing around right now.  edit I just had to say that I think it's funny how as much as the type of person going into convulsions about this likely overlaps with those who rant about using logic over emotion and ""facts over feelings"", and ""expediency over empathy"", they've clearly departed from that narrative, as many carefully compiled and bullet-pointed lists of Admin infractions as they've made."

This is so fucking on point.  As an atheist, this shit just grinds my gears.  I personally see myself as a fallible animal, just as irrational as any animal.  Just as likely to make decisions rooted in emotion rather than logic.  As an atheist, it baffles me that other atheists still put humans on a fucking pedestal like they're ""above it all.""  You know, kind of how religious people put humans on a pedestal above animals.  They really believe ""logic and reason"" will lead them to unfettered truth.  What these motherfuckers need is a couple courses in philosophy, and not the basic Greek shit that will just inflate their egos more.  Some Critical Theory that will slap them and sit them on their ass.  Anyway, yeah, it's already annoying how often I talk to these ""logic and reason"" asshats that degenerate into them obviously being emotionally driven but unable/unwilling to admit it, because that would mean (GASP) that they are just like everyone else, and not some special little white snowflake.  However, this whole fiasco just brought out their emotional insanity to the forefront.  Where in the living fuck is the self reflection in these people?"
blackladies,3c9af5,catofnortherndarknes,5,Mon Jul 6 15:45:16 2015 UTC,Exactly.  You articulated my problem with that attitude far better than I could.

blackladies,3c9af5,garnetsquarefro,10,Mon Jul 6 04:01:22 2015 UTC,"I can't be cold-blooded about a situation or person I really know shit-all about except mostly heresay.

I shed real tears for the fact that POC fight each other for the same low-ass rungs on the ladder while the source sits back and REALLY chomps their popcorn from the top of it."
blackladies,3c9af5,hozac,9,Mon Jul 6 08:51:12 2015 UTC,I think all the doom and gloom predictions that Reddit is somehow about to implode are just wishful thinking on the part of a lot of angry neckbeards.  But I'm actually perfectly fine with the prospect of reddit becoming a ghost town. The only communities I care about on here are the black subs and few other small subreddits that aren't likely to be affected by this whole fiasco.
blackladies,3c9af5,Mship2,8,Mon Jul 6 09:21:11 2015 UTC,"Your last part is the most important to me, almost all the subs I subscribe to would be unaffected if all the assholes leave reddit.

blackladies,3c9af5,wannaridebikes,11,Mon Jul 6 18:11:27 2015 UTC,"My tears would be more than faux for this because she would actually be more likely to piss off racist neckbeards than her replacement, not less (assuming a replacement will only be accepted by the userbase if the racist faction doesn't launch a smear campaign with their more ""innocent"" alts). They think she would close down more racist subs, and I think they are right about that. I think more hasn't happened in this arena because she wants to keep her job. Even if she is the CEO, she can't just proclaim these kind of things from on-high all at once.   She's getting all of this shit because she's an Asian woman who doesn't act like how white nerds expect her to act. It's clear from all the Mao jokes."

It's a term misused to the extent that it's replacing one stereotype with another. 'Complex' is a better substitute, but what I actually mean is 'women who act like people, because that's what they actually are'."
blackladies,3c7e23,wannaridebikes,5,Sun Jul 5 22:25:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but this article is talking about specifically strong black women.  While you may relate to the article, this response feels a bit too much like #alllivesmatter to me.     In this particular case it's not talking about characters on TV, it's talking about the toxicity and the negativity that happens when that ideal is imposed upon actual black women."
blackladies,3c7e23,secretlyintothat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:56:52 2015 UTC,"Eh, the response is still related. It translates to representation as well.   Wouldn't have realized the poster wasn't black had you not said something lol."

I actually do agree with the general point removed from context, but it rubs me the wrong way that as is common, the most visible voice on a topic about black women, in a black woman's sub, designed to give us a voice we don't have elsewhere on this site, on an article about black women, is about  #ALLwomen from a non-black woman.   sigh."

If you organize your life around hatred, you simply have no redeeming aspects. None whatsoever. You destroy everyone around you, even the people you supposedly love. You destroy your own humanity. I was lucky that I got to escape, but not before undergoing some serious abuse.   No one believes me where I live (far, far north of Arkansas.)

I'm not trying to make it about me. It just is what it is: fucking white supremacists are actually attempting to increase their supporter base and sphere of influence. You think it's an accident that the prisons fill with black people? It's not. Someone wants them out of the way and under a boot. The CCC (which is essentially the kkk) is much, much more powerful than talking head politicians will ever admit.   I do sound like a conspiracy theorist, but I'm not one because the evidence of what I'm saying is right there for everyone to see. Most white people just don't want to see it, I guess. I have never been able to understand why, but it literally nauseates me.   I lurk on this sub a lot because reading all the posts on here reminds me that I'm not just paranoid. I try to limit commenting because I don't want to intrude on a private space and ""whitesplain"".  But, trust me, i see it. I see what's happening and I call it out all the time.

When I was in high school, stormfront forums were filled with what you would think rednecks who just discovered their dial-up connection would write. It was almost laughably racist.

At least it was for me.   I also think the first few episodes are kind of slow as they build the stories, but you start getting some real answers as to wtf is going on in episode 4, and then it really picks up."

I didn't feel they mixed very well for most of the show though, it only really seemed to start at episode 8. I wasn't that fond of all the sex either, it just seemed to be a bit excessive and didn't add anything for me. I also didn't like how some of the characters fell in love with each other, it seemed a bit incestious in a way since they all shared such a close bond.  Overall I did enjoy the show."

Like when Nomi was on the run, hops into a random car and suddenly remembers she cant drive.

That's obviously not true for all black women but as someone who has a hard time growing hair I really hate this shit. My hair is short, so what? Besides, not everyone who wears weaves or wigs is bald; those are protective styles to help grow hair and to prevent heat damage and color damage. And believe it or not some black women choose to keep their hair short because they like it."
blackladies,3c3n3l,theworldisbullshit,12,Sat Jul 4 19:41:47 2015 UTC,"A lot of the lack of hair growth for some women have to do with harsh chemicals and applying heat. Almost everyone I know with natural hair has long hair.   On another note, I was just telling someone in the Black hair subreddit about how I wear crochet braids exclusively now and have been for the better part of several years.  My hair is past the brastrap on my back; which is almost as long as the crochet braids I wear. Only my family and very best friends know that my hair is long. No one else needs to know because (1) it's none of their business; (2) the ""oh my god, is that your real hair?!!"" questions irk the hell out of me; and (3) I get irritated when Black dudes try to talk to me just because of my hair. It's like, I could be a bitch on wheels and psycho, but you are enamored with something as irrelevant as hair? Superficial guys get on my last nerve.   If I didn't wear a protective style like crochet braids, I'd have lopped off all of my hair by now because it's a lot to deal with when you are busy and short on time. No one has time to be fussing with hair when they have more important things to do. When I'm less busy in a few years from now, I'll let it back out. Until then, I will do with it what I want to do with it and if people make assumptions based on the fact that I don't wear it out and that they've never seen it, oh well."

They just assume that all Black women are bald and wear weaves because they can't grow their own hair. Also, they might work in an environment that considers natural hair ""unprofessional"" so they resort to straightening it or wearing a weave.   I find it incredibly narrowminded for a guy to generalize Black women like that especially if they're Black too. There are whole movements based on NOT generalizing Black men, but some of them want to take the time to generalize us after the fact?! Nah. GTFOH."

Which... considering the white supremacy of this country and the history of lynching black men with the excuse of using possible violation of Becky, is hilariously sad and oh-so-expected,  indeed."
blackladies,3c2p2o,garnetsquarefro,6,Sat Jul 4 16:47:23 2015 UTC,"the ultra dehumanizing use of black men as disembodied giant black dildos ""destroying"" delicate white women.   Yup. I feel like that is pretty obvious but I was referring mostly to Black women being erased even from a category that is perceived to be/ should be their own. When I click on ""ebony"" I want to see Black women, preferably with Black men. Like, even in porn ""Ebony"" doesn't even mean ""Black"". Damn it."
blackladies,3c2p2o,ParticularYouth,3,Sat Jul 4 17:00:30 2015 UTC,"That's catering to the white male gaze.   Pretty skeptical of this.  There are definitely plenty of cuckold-y white guys, but I'm pretty sure the larger gaze in this case would be the female.  There really isn't that great of a difference between the genders watching porn too.  When it's Latino or Asian guys banging white girls, is it also the white male gaze at large here?  LOL  No, I'm sure that demand is mostly fueled by the white female gaze if not equally weighted with black male gaze too.  (Cracking up at the phrases)."
blackladies,3c2p2o,NSFW895,4,Sat Jul 4 18:12:06 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure there is plenty of black men who like black men, white female porn. But, I would be lying if I said that specific genre hasn't become very huge in the past couple years. Even with some black women in porn, they are mostly with white guys. I just want some 1080p black on black. And that is hard to find. I think porn does cater mostly to white men."
blackladies,3c2p2o,garnetsquarefro,2,Sat Jul 4 18:46:25 2015 UTC,"I think porn does cater mostly to white men.   I agree with this as well.  My main point was not every interracial pairing is trying to or does incite the white male gaze.  Often times it's really just between the two (whatever races-genders involved) and not every porn is catered to white guys.  The main reason (American) porn is overall geared toward white guys is because most porn just features a white couple, simple as that.  I think the next largest niche/category would then be lesbian porn (even interracial lesbian porn) which heavily skews towards white men, if not men in general.  I think it might be a little reaching to say the white male gaze is still as prominent in porn featuring a MOC and WW or MOC and WOC, that's the distinction I wanted to make."
blackladies,3c2p2o,gurrrl6_336,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:04:07 2015 UTC,"Respect your POV but I gotta disagree because think about the phrasing and scenarios used.  Giant, monster, destroy and so on....  I'm sure there are plenty of  people who are not white men for which it happens to be their cuppa, but I feel confident in saying that for the most part, with most interracial porn being degrading in someway to the non-white party, and women it is purposefully for the white male gaze.  Remember, I'm talking about who it's made for, not who it happens to attract.  Ask yourself how often have you seen porn with a title or descriptive phrase that uses a degrading label for the white male talent??"

blackladies,3c2p2o,garnetsquarefro,10,Sat Jul 4 15:52:53 2015 UTC,"You will never see black or latina girls referred to as sweet, innocent, virginal, etc. In porn.  That is strictly reserved for small white and asian women."
blackladies,3c2p2o,supcaci,15,Sat Jul 4 18:09:21 2015 UTC,"I think it's because the actual audience for said porn is generally white men, so the euphemism is employed. ""Ebony"" makes people less squirmy than ""black.""  EDIT: sent too soon. I think it also has to do with the desire to connote a certain amount of femininity for certain types of this porn. ""Black"" is generally used for men, usually in the context of a stereotypically large black member being used on an orifice belonging to a person of some other race. ""Ebony,"" probably owing to its less frequent usage and terminal long ""e"" sound, seems more feminine. This certainly does not mean there is any chivalry in evidence in films employing the term; I think, again, it is simply intended to protect the delicate sensibilities of the primary audience.  And with that I confirm that I spend more time than I'd like to admit on porn search engines."
blackladies,3c2p2o,lovelyone20,7,Sat Jul 4 07:41:34 2015 UTC,"The actual audience isn't generally white men, EVERYBODY watches porn.  But it does mostly cater to that gaze.  Someone could make a shitload of money by catering to gazes other than white men, but there you have it.  I think ebony is about making black sound more exotic.  EDIT:  As an aside Channing Tatum and whoever else is producing those Magic Mike movies is a prime example of profitting from widening the target of the sexual gaze, despite not being porn.  That simple franchise could easily make damn near a billion dollars if it lasts long enough."

blackladies,3c1r1n,hozac,4,Sat Jul 4 09:35:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I think lumping it in with ""white savior"" at all does a disservice to the book. Making white people feel good about white privilege is a crucial element of the white savior trope. One of the major points of TKAM was that white privilege cannot be used as a tool for good even in the hands of a well-meaning white person. A system that codifies white privilege will always result in injustice. Meanwhile in ""white savior"" movies the message is sure, there may be poor Black people and rich white people, but a good white person can save poor Black people (as long as they're deserving) and it will all be OK."
blackladies,3c1r1n,kitcat_kittycat,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:57:16 2015 UTC,"That's a fair argument. Admittedly it's been years since I read the book, so the idea that white privilege (although it obviously wouldn't have been called that at the time) will always result in injustice regardless of any good intentions on the part any white person could very well have been part of the main thrust of the narrative."

People who think racism is calling someone a slur and is therefore mostly over don't get that this, this right here is the biggest problem.  The people hiring these white male directors (many not particular standouts) aren't purposely being malicious or exclusionary.  They are subconsciously hiring what is safe, familiar, and comfortable to them.  This situation is why affirmative action was instituted, this. right here.  Diversity is about getting a wider range, more broad perspectives, and not seeing the same things from the same perspectives over and and over again. It's not about taking anything away from white men, which is what they so often think. It's about adding more colors to the pot.  Seeing eggshell white all the damn time gets boring, okay?"

You have no voice and youre essentially running the show blind.   This is what happened with many subreddits that do AMAs, and it caused an uproar because their support system was cut off.

So now, the mods had planned AMAs, sometimes with very important scientists or other high-level celebrities, coming up very soon and literally no way to contact them because that had been something Victoria had always done. When the mods contacted the admins asking how they should handle the situation, the admins basically had no backup plan, no idea the entire scope of Victoria's job, and were either completely unresponsive to multiple attempts to reach them, or completely dismissive and sometimes even rude to the mods who asked for help.

I've also heard that the ""team"" assigned to doing AMAs has done absolutely nothing so far, leaving the mods to organize them completely on their own.   I also wouldn't characterize it as ""copycats,"" I think it's more in solidarity of the mods of the subs who feel they were completely screwed over. You can disagree with the protest itself, think it's dumb or petty or whatever, but calling protesting something in solidarity ""copycatting"" is a bit dismissive."

I think there's a lot of overreacting, but no I don't think the first set of subs (~5-10) were just throwing fits.  They had to shut down because they couldn't do AMAs.  The majority (some going private then going public again shortly after) have followed because of this solidarity that's really just masked hatred for the site and admins.  There are plenty of subs that don't orchestrate AMAs or didn't seem to vent communication between the admins prior that joined in.  It makes me think of copycats TBH.  Edit: https://np.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/csq6ekp?context=3  (The mod was kn0thing.)"
blackladies,3bzg0h,Subclavian,8,Fri Jul 3 21:56:32 2015 UTC,Seems this all comes down to what Victoria did that got her sacked and Reddit with no backup AMA handler.

blackladies,3bzg0h,kaboutermeisje,30,Fri Jul 3 20:42:37 2015 UTC,"They are dense because they want to support her by having the defaults and a lot popular subs go ""dark"" aka private, but the damn gilding has tripled since the announcements........so guess who they are supporting still even though they are going dark...........  also, why are they making this about Victoria? If they are unhappy with the ADMINS then go with that, declare war on them for their lack of  communication and direction(l have beef with them not banning actual racist subs, but will ban fatpeoplehate)."
blackladies,3bzg0h,dratthecookies,7,Fri Jul 3 13:24:08 2015 UTC,Every movement wants its martyr. I'm in the wait and see what's going on camp.
blackladies,3bzg0h,blacknight,7,Fri Jul 3 13:35:42 2015 UTC,"If you ask a lot of the mods of subs that have gone private, it actually isn't about Victoria. It's about how the admins handled the whole thing, leaving them completely in a lurch and not responding to their attempts to contact them. The average redditor may misinterpret this as being about her, but for most of the mods, it's about lack of communication."
blackladies,3bzg0h,Mship2,9,Fri Jul 3 15:21:44 2015 UTC,"Which I said on my comment earlier, but why use Victoria as the catalyst? It's bullshit, Reddit is/has been a business before I came here in 2012, in a week from now nobody will care and everything will be like it was before ""we want Victoria or Rage"", I mean where else are the circle-jerkers gonna go to? Digg lol"
blackladies,3bzg0h,mangaloree,17,Fri Jul 3 15:22:53 2015 UTC,"but why use Victoria as the catalyst?    Well, probably because her being fired directly caused a huge problem for a lot of them, as they had AMAs set up that were now not going to happen, and the admins were completely unhelpful in trying to resolve the huge issue they had just caused. I think a lot of the mods felt a rug had been pulled out from under them, and the admins were directly to blame by firing Victoria and not having a backup plan, and they were completely unwilling to help. So they protested. Makes sense to me.  From what I've seen from lots of the mods of subreddits who went dark, they aren't actually protesting the firing of Victoria, per se, they are protesting the lack of a backup plan which caused enormous problems for them on projects they had voluntarily poured a lot of time into, and then the general dismissive, and sometimes even rude, attitude they got from admins when they asked for help or for a backup plan."
blackladies,3bzg0h,kaboutermeisje,8,Fri Jul 3 16:21:38 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, I appreciate the actual logical reasoning in your comment. Me and you came to the same conclusion, mines was more pissed off by how people will just jump on the ""reddit is going to shit amirite guys"" bandwagon."
blackladies,3bzg0h,mangaloree,3,Fri Jul 3 16:28:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's right to call it a bandwagon when it has been steadily going to shit for a while now... for some this is just the straw that broke the camel's back.   And yeah, there are a ton more important things to protest about, the biggest IMO being ""politics"" censorship (not /r/politics, I mean how most major subs have ""no politics"" rules that are used to quell dissent). Also, manipulation of public opinion by astroturfers.   Though I wouldn't say that invalidates what's going on now. Revolution in this case is good and we are starting to see some of it."
blackladies,3bzg0h,kaboutermeisje,10,Fri Jul 3 16:41:33 2015 UTC,"Another thing is, people are acting like it's ""everyone taking a stand against blah blah"" when really, most of us didn't have a choice in the matter. If the mods of these subreddits didn't make it private, I bet most people (even the ones talking shit) would have continued to use them."

blackladies,3bzg0h,kaboutermeisje,2,Fri Jul 3 17:02:29 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you that folks would probably continue using the subs, a lot of the subs that have gone dark voted to do that."

OMG, the last few days were ugh.  Can you believe I packed at the absolute last point in order to move apartments (though thankfully in the same building).  I moved my shit all by myself between just two flights...but man, that shit was heavy.  :(    I packed everything on the 1st, moved it down the 1st, and only had a few furniture left on the 2nd and had to have some moving guys handle that (not about to break my neck).  I'm sore and the reason I procrastinated was because I've been in a funk about having to leave.  I'm happy that I could leave my shitty roommate and her boyfriend that basically lived there the last few months, but I wouldn't have had to leave if my cousin didn't bail in the first place (only reason I couldn't stay).  Anyway, that place might as well be quarantined off.  Place was an absolute mess because of the roommate and I'm glad I don't have to wear a gas mask to use a bathroom.

On the show, they speculated that families created this myth because it was thought to be more dignified to be descended from Native-Americans than raped by Europeans.

blackladies,3byaot,doodoodarling,16,Sat Jul 4 15:06:52 2015 UTC,"As RuPaul said, ""You're born naked, and the rest is drag."" This is true for so many things. Having multiple ways of presenting yourself doesn't make you ""fake"" or ""indecisive;"" it doesn't mean you don't know who you ""really"" are. Be a chameleon. That's totally okay. And it's really effective in getting you what you want/need when you know how to best approach people.   Be selfish sometimes. You're all you've got. Nobody else is going to be there with you and for you 100% of the time; you are the only one who's there from birth to death. So take care of you first, and let everyone else get in line.   Also, you don't owe anyone an explanation for anything. You do not have to explain yourself or your choices. And one of the most powerful things you can do is say, ""This conversation is over,"" and walk away. Plenty of people will want to engage you and trap you with negativity, but you do not have to engage.   You have control at the most basic level, because no matter what happens, you can choose how to feel about it. It is perfectly acceptable to experience and honor your feelings, no matter what they are. And if you choose to, you can move past them and act in a way that will get you closest to what you want. But remember--you can always change what you want.   There is ALWAYS another way to get where you're trying to go. If your path is blocked, it doesn't mean you've failed. Double back; go around; take a detour; hell, girl, learn to fly. But even if you feel you need to sit down and cry for a while, don't let that be your only action.   When you have a thought in your head about yourself, in any aspect, think about whether you would tolerate some gross stranger saying that about your best friend. If not, then don't tolerate it, and don't continue it. The world has enough assholes in it who will try to bring you down; if you jump on that bandwagon, the assholes win."
blackladies,3byaot,multirachael,8,Fri Jul 3 13:18:17 2015 UTC,"It's okay to be black.  It's okay to be black.  #It's okay to be black.  It's okay to be black.   I cannot fucking stress this enough. American pop culture can not exist without black people. American music culture cannot exist without black people. Tell me why black people made this country and yet our black youth are shamed for being ""too black"" in the media? I have a friend who's sister is ""woke"" and appreciates her blackness…her sister however is still sleep. I had to gently check her and tell her that being woke is not a bad thing when she said that her sis was ""being too black"".   For my beautiful black younger sisters that develop faster than anyone else; it ain't your fault. For my beautiful black younger sisters who haven't developed yet, it ain't your fault either. Don't ever let anyone run up on you trying to force you into what they think a black girl should be. Don't let these fuckers make fun of your small butts. Don't let these fuckfaces make fun of your big butts, because as you can see every girl wants one. I used to like a boy who made fun of my ""big butt"", and now look the hell where pop culture is now?   Divorce yourself from ""conventional"" (code word WHITE) beauty. No matter how many times you fry your scalp with the devil's crack, the hair on your head will probably not be straight. Learn to take care of it and what it needs. If you choose to continue to use the creamy crack then I won't shame you for it. Just know what you're getting into when you put it on your head. There hasn't been enough conclusive evidence to prove the harmfulness of the product because of reasons.   You won't ever look like some of these highly lauded non black celebrities and that's okay. They're all fake and miserable as fuck anyways. Be glad that when you walk outside your skin cells don't cook like food.   Don't ever let a non-black person (or anyone really) weave-check you. These folks will worship Kim Kardashian, Paris, Meagan Foxx who all. wear. weaves. but have the unmitigated gall to ask black women if their hair is real. If they ask, check that ass immediately by asking them if the hair on their head is real. Follow-up by telling them to not ask asinine questions and ask them why they'd ask you such a question when they wouldn't ask it to their other non-black friends. Of course you don't have to follow this template—come up with your own snarky classy shade and be sure to tell them that Auntie Mangaloree taught you.   I don't see why your weave should matter. You paid for that damn hair and by god you have the right to wear it as you so please.   Events like BlackGirlsRock were created for you—for us. And you should know that this is the case because this country isn't our fucking ally. Black women are ridiculed by stereotypes and receive little help. We're insulted on the daily by men who are supposed to protect us (not shading black men). So whenever you hear someone talking slick say stuff like ""AllGirlsRock"", realize that we NEED that program. Black girls need to know that we are needed—you are needed—in this fucked up American climate. So don't ever feel for a second that BlackGirlsRock is racist, because it isn't. Fuck whoever says it is.   Don't let fuckers try to label you. Janelle Monaé has a wide range of talents and her ArchAndroid discography is evidence of this. In fact, the genres of this album were so far-reaching that people had a hard time putting an encompassing genre on her. FKA Twigs is also another artist people have a difficult time labeling. I guess what I'm saying is ""Do you, boo.""  Black girls rock, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise."

I wished I unleashed more of my true character and personality then instead of keeping quiet outside of certain situations.

Some minor snafu pops up that inconveniences you somewhat? Throw a shit fit tantrum and try to get your way.   I have no idea why she was let go, but reddit is a business and shit happens. These people need to move on already and maybe this time plan for contingencies.   Edit: And as for Jesse Jackson's AMA, I don't see how that would have anything to do with anything. As far as I'm aware, Victoria didn't pick and choose what questions got asked or what questions were answered. However, if she was doing something wrong and manipulating the AMA then yeah, maybe firing her was the right thing to do. I doubt any of the admins thought all of these subs would be so dumb as to rely completely and utterly on one person. I just cant get past that. ONE person is not available and now you can't do anything, seriously? You got what you deserved then. Take it as a lesson learned."

blackladies,3bxic5,Situation_SNAFU,6,Fri Jul 3 03:49:25 2015 UTC,"So I wasn't aware of the situation until I saw this thread, read the comments here, promptly went 'what the fuck', then started clicking through the OP to read up on it more to even begin to understand what was happening.  Reading a bit...OK, I can see how the first 5 or so subs (maybe 10, IDK at this point) had a justifiable reason to go private.  At first, it seemed (from the comments) like they did so just to throw a tantrum, but really the first few did so to shut down because they couldn't do the AMAs not just to protest.  But the large amount of followers seem to only do so in 'solidarity' (but more to vent rage against Reddit and the admins).  I'm not going to jump to any conclusions about Victoria and Reddit.  I just don't know and don't care enough to speculate (but already seeing the wild Ellen Pao (and her husband) and Jesse Jackson hate).    I really think this is a two-way street idiocy...like Victoria was the sole, integral component of this particular system and Reddit has shown they were stupid for letting her go (even if she did some ills, don't unless you have a handy replacement), but there are dozens of mods who heavily depended on her all over the site and this fact wasn't brought up before through an open letter or similar?  Like...huh?  I want to think this has been formally expressed from the mod teams to the admins at one point, right?  Please correct me if I'm terribly wrong.  Anyway, if not....again what?  No doubt Reddit is fucking stupid for letting this happen in the first place, but you're telling me mods from all the big, defaults didn't  bother to pressure the admins enough to either give them more power in orchestrating the AMAs and/or hire somebody to help the chick out?  This site, man..."
blackladies,3bxic5,Rangda_Bangda,8,Fri Jul 3 08:09:26 2015 UTC,"While we're talking about Reddit drama right now, can someone explain all of the Ellen Pao hate? I never really read up on it and didn't catch wind that tons of people hated her until all the random posts and subreddits started appearing.  Do people hate her because she sued her former employer for gender discrimination? Or is it because Reddit took down fatpeoplehate?"
blackladies,3bxic5,mangaloree,10,Fri Jul 3 10:16:56 2015 UTC,"Both and a bit more. I don't really follow dram but from what I gathered taking down fat peoplehate and other harassment subreddits made her look like she was the defender of evil SJWs. While her business practices aren't the best I doubt this is the real reason. I personally believe that because she is an Asian-American woman in power, white male reddit (basically just reddit) hates her by default.  Double that with some popular racist posts (Chairman Pao, references to Kim Jong Un/North Korea, or just her being Asian) turn into easy karma and a full circlejerk."
blackladies,3bxic5,mangaloree,12,Fri Jul 3 16:11:36 2015 UTC,"I had posted this on SRS, but I believe:  A. She wasn't fired over the Jessie Jackson AMA, because his responses weren't as ""confusing"" or strange as articles are saying (it's only strange in that he even answered it, not in the answer itself, but I thought it was hilarious.) Either way, why she got fired is, truly, none of our business. Like in the real world, when people get fired it's between the firerer and the fired. The CEO isn't going to tell the whole staff ahead of time ""by the way; Tim, your direct supervisor, is going to be fired next week. Don't tell Tim."" We have no idea of the inner workings of the organization - no matter how incompetent it may be or seem.  B. I get why IAMA Mods are irritated (because she makes their jobs easier/happen). Especially when you're basically volunteering and actions like this makes the volunteer experience...less than savory. However, when your whole system depends on one person, I don't know if that exposes the inadequacy of mods or what to be honest. Kind of telling.  C. But for everyone else on reddit freaking out, this whole situation reeks of TMIS - ""Too Much Internet Syndrome.""

I think there's a consensus that there was nothing she could have done to prevent Reddit from going in on JJ. To them, he's the biggest racist this world has ever known.   Does Jesse even know the kind of shit they say about him? Not even just on Reddit, but it seems to me that white people—conservative or nah—hate his guts."

(The ratio of Jewish to other is about 60/40 in my firms office.)   This works to my benefit all the time. They invite me to things, they ask my opinions and advice about things that relate to the job but are framed as Jewish. ""Hey Stillness, can you look over this menu for the board meeting and make sure it's ok for Passover?""

I've never made a claim to being Jewish. I've never been anything but 100% open about coming from a mixed faith family but I'm not stupid enough to blast that I'm a godless heathen all over the office either.

My dad used to make comments about finding a good Nigerian man to marry, and I'd go 'nah...' for whatever reason without really thinking about it. Now I know why. Every. single. one. of my dad's brothers cheated on their spouse, including him, and their sisters were keeping secrets for them. Crazy secrets like babies and multiple wives. And it was all just, waved away as boys being boys. My dad's uncle called up my mom during her divorce talking about, 'Don't worry about it, even I used to have a woman on the side when my wife was alive.' Really?  And then all my mom's friends that were married to Nigerian men are divorced or about to be. At best is the husband who never helps out nor puts a damn dime to the family expenses including the mortgage of the house he lives in. At worst two of them went to jail for all sorts of fraud.   And when I tell my dad (who no longer lives here because my mom finally got rid of his ass) that I have no desire to get married he still tries to convince me otherwise."

We hope your child is beautiful regardless, but don't tell me I should get with a certain race just so I could raise a child that is beautiful.   Let me just explain my Friday and Saturday night to you of last week. Last Friday I went out with the aforementioned Indian friend to meet up with 2 chicks she met. One black and one white. The black girl only dates brunette white guys, because she's convinced that having a baby with a blonde or red head will lead to an ugly mullatto child, but with a brunette it's the ""perfect mullatto"" child. I told her left and right and she has no say in what her child will look like and I've seen all sorts of the spectrum.   Saturday night I went out with a Lyft driver I met from Zambia, we went to a party where I then met people from Togo, Ethiopia, Uganda, Congo, AA's from Ohio, CO and Haiti. It felt so GOOD. Because we were all so beautiful and having a blast. I noticeably felt like our conversation was well spent and there was lots of exchanging of info. We talked about dating and said we were all open to all races. No one harped about how gorgeous being white was, instead, if it happened, it happened. But we knew and recognized us as all being damn good looking in the first place."
blackladies,3bwejw,Omgitstheash,9,Thu Jul 2 20:58:13 2015 UTC,"My fiancé is white. We have no intention of having kids. I honestly never even thought about what our children would look like, more so that they would be weird because they have awkward-ass parents.  I agree that trying to educate white people is difficult, and tiresome (that's putting it mildly). My fiancé's family falls into that category. I want to educate them; he has given up on them entirely, and is more than happy to put as much distance between us and them as possible. Perhaps I'm naive in hoping that they'll be capable of understanding, but if they want to be part of our lives, they have to be aware and respectful.   Edited to add: I also wanted to agree with the point that in some respects no one is ""safe"" when it comes to dating. My family is from the Caribbean, and I dated a black guy who completely shit all over our culture, i.e the food is disgusting, the accents are horrible, etc, as did his parents. That was fucking horrible.  Also edited to add: I really hate the term ""swirling"". Are we frozen yogurt?"
blackladies,3bwejw,RhombusBlue,7,Thu Jul 2 20:20:11 2015 UTC,"but if they want to be part of our lives, they have to be aware and respectful.   This to me is where the line is.

If they don't and won't consider it? Done."

There are some things they don't agree with or eat. But they are respectful about it.

blackladies,3bwejw,wafflebread,26,Sat Jul 4 01:55:13 2015 UTC,"I think all black women should be VERY wary about dating men in general. I think our culture creates a lot of problematic assumptions about black women that get absorbed by men all over the world. Dating for us is definitely harder than what other women have to deal with.   That being said, I think black women need to be very wary of dating white men.  Tbh I have never frequented those swirl websites or YouTube videos because I think it's super weird. But white men are no more special than any other man, and any woman who thinks so is fooling herself.  Not only does explaining anything racial to white men become tiring, but if they have racist family members, you are kind of doing a disservice to your self-esteem. I hope no black woman sticks around with a white man with a racist family, especially if he never defends you.  It is very rare to find a white male partner who is anti-racist. Also by virtue of them being white, they will never truly understand the racism you face as a black person. But I do think they exist.   But since there are more black women (in the US) than available black men, if a black woman wants to expand her options, then I see nothing wrong with that. But all of the previous stuff I said applies...just because there may be more available white men around doesn't mean they are better or worthy of having relationships with.  I will say that I personally know only two black women married to white men, but they are both very educated about racial issues and love their black wives with the utmost respect and reverence.   Dating only people of color is probably safer in terms of guarding your mental and emotional health. If a black woman had the option to do so, I would probably recommend this over dating white men, if possible. But we also need to be wary in these situations. There are plenty of men who fall under the PoC umbrella who think black women are trash because the world teaches them that. Or worse, they have families that will raise hell if their son dates outside of their race.   We have to always make sure we are safe around men. We are probably the most vulnerable to being hated, while at the same time expected to always be ""strong"" ""hold it down"" for weak-ass men. That man could be white or black.  Lol as you can see, I have thought about this a lot. TL;DR: don't date a white man if he sees nothing wrong with Rachel Dolezal or tilts his head like a confused dog at #blacklivesmatter. Lol"

And what he doesn't understand, he is fully aware that he doesn't understand, and he just listens - really listens - to my experience and takes my word for it, not challenging or questioning me on it. He's also in a profession where he is actually trying to make a difference socially in these areas. It's funny watching him and my dad discuss politics - they practically finish each other's sentences.  I say all of this just to add a different perspective to the conversation.

blackladies,3bwejw,Princess_Mango,6,Thu Jul 2 22:53:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I am in Germany of all places with my white German husband. (like glow in the dark in the winter white).   He listens. He stands up for me.  He'll stand up for people he doesn't even know. He doesn't fight me for the permission to say the N-word he just respects me enough to leave it alone.   He doesn't sit there unaware either. With all that shit going down in the US for Black folks, he brings it up from time to time to check on my mental well-being, which I appreciate since I got used to not talking about that stuff in mixed company.   Other than that we have a ""normal"" relationship with ups and downs and the American/European thing is more a topic of debate than our skin color.   His family is awesome and pretty progressive as well.  Maybe I am lucky, but I don't think that we're that unusual."
blackladies,3bwejw,RhombusBlue,9,Fri Jul 3 07:12:31 2015 UTC,"I think all black women should be VERY wary about dating men in general. I think our culture creates a lot of problematic assumptions about black women that get absorbed by men all over the world.   Truth. I date interracially but always hold on to this...""White dudes aren't special"" is the moral of that story.    We have to always make sure we are safe around men. We are probably the most vulnerable to being hated, while at the same time expected to always be ""strong"" ""hold it down"" for weak-ass men. That man could be white or black.   Yep."
blackladies,3bwejw,PeachGirl89,9,Thu Jul 2 20:25:51 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think the bulk of problems that arise from IR dating involves the background of the partner. Did he grow up in a diverse community? Has he interacted with anyone from your race/culture? I think those things build a foundation of compatibility within your relationship. Granted, you will still have to explain things to them concerning black women (i.e. hair). In actuality, the only man who you will not have to explain things to are black men and men who have previously dated black women. Even with those kind of men, you have to be wary of becoming someone's ebony fetish. But all in all, just because someone knows about you, doesn't mean they are concerned about you (black women). Let me explain~  Currently, I am in a IR with an Asian male. Although I have dated outside my race before (all races), and those guys were in-tuned with black culture, they wouldn't stand with me for any issues, especially race related. Goes with the saying ""Everybody wanna be black until it's actually the time to be black."" With my Asian bf, although he did not grow up around blacks, he knows right from wrong and is very perceptive of the ignorance in today's society. Although no one can whole-heartedly know your experiences as a black woman except maybe a black man, dating another minority who can sympathize with you definitely helps. He knows the struggle of being discriminated against plenty of times. There are great benefits for dating  other minorities, but the same rule applies to everyone.  I see a lot of black women lower their standards when they begin to date IR, and they shouldn't. You shouldn't stand for back-handed compliments, or anyone who will stand behind you, not beside you in race related issues. Feel free to explore your options and don't limit yourself, but be sure to be careful."
blackladies,3bwejw,The_Specialist_says,11,Fri Jul 3 05:18:34 2015 UTC,My SO is from Poland. He emigrated here when he was a kid. He is a true socialist at heart cares about equality all that stuff. I have had more problems dating people of my race well culture since I'm Nigerian. My problem was that I am not proper Nigerian wifey material since I'm apathetic towards religion and do not want to be submissive etc. And when I attempted to date black guys I always felt I wasn't quite 'black' enough for them. I mean I had a guy click at me as if that if my native tongue once as a joke...   Another thing is that a lot of Africans especially the ones who moved here as children can be as anti-Black as a typical racist. The problem is they see black people as lazy and squandering opportunities. So my experience with blackness is weird because I am black but wasn't accepted as so when I was a kid. I don't see myself as different or special from black people because I am Nigeria.   For me I always had friends and acquaintances who were from everywhere. I didn't seek out a white boyfriend. It just worked out that he is understanding and hard working. The fact he isn't from money helps too because he grew up with a lot of minority kids. I think there is a difference between white people and people who emigrated from Europe. His mother has no problem with me. She doesn't quit understand me all the time she mainly speaks polish but I at least know she likes me more than her son :)
blackladies,3bwejw,lovelyone20,11,Fri Jul 3 08:34:07 2015 UTC,"I mean I had a guy click at me as if that if my native tongue once as a joke...   Welcome my sister!

blackladies,3bwejw,lottikey,6,Sat Jul 4 00:26:43 2015 UTC,"*Black Americans.  They're not prejudiced because they're black, but because they're Americans if they're hating them.  Africans are not anti-black than any other black person around the world (it's usually the opposite), but plenty of them sip that anti-black American Koolaid and believe that many are 'ghetto' or ironically look down at most Americans because they think they're lazy and not seizing the opportunity."
blackladies,3bwejw,The_Specialist_says,3,Fri Jul 3 08:54:22 2015 UTC,Africans can and are anti- black in the sense they see themselves better than black American people. They don't want to associated with American blackness. They will say that black Americans who protest are foolish and should be working instead. These are anti-black feelings. These are the same feelings many white people in this country have. That all black Americans do is complain and not work. They forget that is the work of black Americans that make this country palpable for African immigrants. So that is what I'm getting at.
blackladies,3bwejw,lottikey,8,Fri Jul 3 09:23:29 2015 UTC,"Did you not read my post?  We're talking about black Africans, right?   Some hate on black Americans because they internalize the shitty American propaganda that all blacks (but specifically American ones) are lazy, ghetto, and up to no good and the Africans that try to suck America's teat gobble that up display such behaviors themselves.  It's like special snowflakes in any group who aspire to get in with the in-crowd and start hating on others just to fit in.  This prejudice isn't due to race (duh, they're both black*, Africans generally aren't self-hating simply because of race), this is due to ethnic/cultural snobbery not anti-black racism.  It's like some Europeans tipping their nose up against white Americans, they don't shit on them because they're white, it's because they don't like Americans.  That's the difference."
blackladies,3bwejw,The_Specialist_says,5,Fri Jul 3 09:38:29 2015 UTC,That's the thing though. Africans who act like that aren't trying to be cool and acceptable to white Americans.   What is anti-blackness to you. I think looking down on other black people is anti-black. Typically Africans don't call themselves black. They call themselves Africans or whatever country they are from. Is this bad or good I don't know.
blackladies,3bwejw,lottikey,5,Fri Jul 3 10:49:34 2015 UTC,"Don't call things willy-nilly anti-black without looking at the cause of it.  Do they hate them because they're black?  Of course not.  These same fools hate them because they believe their ethnicity/nationality is better, not the race because the race is the same.  The other example was an analogy and while it's usually just cultural snobbery at place (again, most aren't like this), there are definitely some Africans who do this to suck up to white people, don't think this is impossible.   I think looking down on other black people is anti-black.   Why?  So you think it's simply anti-black even if the reasons are completely unrelated to race or racial stereotypes/expectations?  So if a black person hates on another because they like a certain game, is it just anti-blackness now?  Why are you reducing us all to just our racial identity?  Are you seriously telling me that black people are always anti-black when disparaging other black people when it comes to other identities and opinions that are not about race?  What.   Typically Africans don't call themselves black.   This is so beyond false.  Now I know where you're heading towards.  No.  Africans will say they're black, but that's not usually their primary identification.  You ask someone from Africa, they will say 'insert ethnicity or nationality', but if specifically asked for race, they will say 'black' (assuming we're only talking about black Africans here).  Just like you'll ask anyone from anywhere else, if they know their heritage, of course, they'll say it first then their race because race is so incredibly broad and can contain tons of different cultures and more within it."

For me the problem comes when their anti-Blackness pops up. It bothers me more than it does for non-Black men TBH.
blackladies,3bwejw,Zanovia,7,Thu Jul 2 20:28:18 2015 UTC,"I'm still open to dating interracially but to be honest when I say that I pretty much mean dating non Black POC. Like I can find a white guy cute and all but my ""like"" threshold before I would date a white guy is waaaaaaay higher because there are things about being a minority that he will just never get. On the other hand someone who's not Black won't get being Black in America, but at least he will get being a minority in general. It was always kinda a stress relief to get together with a POC friend and complain a bit and get ""I know right?!"" or at least a ""huh, doesn't happen to me but I know what you're talking about"" instead of ""Wait that actually happens?"""

blackladies,3bwejw,IrbyTremor,20,Sun Jul 5 20:24:40 2015 UTC,"Even while my SO is white I feel this. Because I know this feeling and I'm thankful he's on the level. Because I dont think I have it in me to put in time to educate any other White person, like, ever again. Not in these times.  Frankly you have every right to be wary. Dealing with most white people is like navigating a field of landmines. If you dont shut up and let them say anti-black shit, no matter what, its your fault and you might as well be Voldemort.  And speaking of Voldemort thats how they see anyone who holds whiteness accountable for anything. whiteness is the illusion of:   A meritocracy. Saying white supremacy exists is taken as an insult because they think the explanation for why inequality exists is that they're all magically quite exceptional. And of course, we're not.  Implied racial innocence: whiteness believes itself to be stainless.  Completely in the top drawer of morality. So any accountability toward Whiteness is understood as ""We would never do that. We may have slipped up in the past and made a few mistakes but MLK washed away our sins"" Individualism while everyone else is a hivemind. One unit representing the whole because we're all the same. So any discussion of racism is ""Well I didnt do that/think that so you're being racist by calling me white and saying white people did something bad!""   I have only been able to deal with this in a relationship once and years ago. And it did not last long at all. It fucking sucked and it took a toll on me. Never again. If I'd been dealing with it in this relationship it'd be over too.  It rips your soul out and stomps on it. I also second /u/wafflebread. Be wary of dudes in general alongside never getting it twisted and thinking some non-black man or woman's ice is colder."
blackladies,3bwejw,blacklonewolf,14,Thu Jul 2 21:00:45 2015 UTC,"I've never dated interracially and never will.

I love that we can connect more easily and I don't have to explain simple things about being black, they get it. I love that I don't have to wonder whether his parents, relatives, and friends will accept me due to my race. I love that I don't have to explain that racism still exists. I love how sexy black men are, anything else would be a step down."
blackladies,3bwejw,lovelyone20,3,Fri Jul 3 02:17:43 2015 UTC,"Girl I don't know what to do either. I think about dating IRR, non-Blacks have approached me. But I want to marry a Black man, but I don't know if I will. Just thinking about not marrying one scares me a little.  They're are really attractive, but I know every Black woman in America can't marry a Black man. So I have to keep my options open, or I can go Africa/Caribbeans! lol"
blackladies,3bwejw,julepie,10,Fri Jul 3 03:33:30 2015 UTC,"Just to preface this, I am a black man and I'm fairly new to Reddit. I know this is a safe place for black women, so If overstep any boundaries or express problematic ideas, please let me know so I can learn and act accordingly. (That isn't to say I think I'm entitled to being taught, but I hope I got my point across.)  I feel the exact same way! When I was growing up I never considered dating or marrying a non-black woman. I didn't really have any meaningful reason as to why other than that I was just really attracted to them, dreamed of a beautiful black family, and coming from a pro-black household it just seemed right. However after receiving virtually zero dating success in high school I entertained the idea of expressing interest in non-black women when I started college.   It took me a little less than a semester to figure out I would considered dating outside of my race ever again. I don't know if it was the fact that I was becoming more educated and aware, for the first time in my life I had a black friend group, that I was never 100% behind the idea of dating interracially in the first place, or some combination of the three, but nearly every substantial interaction with non-black (and in particular white) women was exceedingly off-putting. I only went on three dates, but they were with three different white women because I couldn't get past the first one. I remember one time a white woman I was just having a friendly conversation with out of the blue brought up that ""black men were really attracted to her."" She went on to explain that it because she had ""the body but with none of the bad attitude black women have."" I got angry, called her out, and left the argument amazed that she thought that was a reasonable thing to say. Even ignoring the blatant stereotyping, the implication that a black woman's value in relation to other women is rooted in her body is absolutely disgusting.  Given the expanse of white supremacy and the prevailing mentalities of white people in general, I'm honestly not even comfortable being friends with them anymore let alone being romantically involved with one. The way I see it, if no other group of women has the capacity to empathize with black racial issues to the same degree as black women, if no other group of women has the ability to understand the prevalence of anti-blackness and white supremacy to the same degree as black women, and if no other group of women is more beautiful my eyes than black women, then I personally see no justification in pursuing anything but a black woman as a life partner.  That's just my sentiments thought. I'm not against interracial relationships as a concept or people that date interracially, but they're definitely not for me."
blackladies,3bwejw,viversemrumo,15,Fri Jul 3 06:31:38 2015 UTC,"I'm giving up on dating before I've even started. Men are just awful. IR dating has never appealed to me. I could never see myself in a IRR because I know I would not be able to handle dealing with racism/microaggressions from someone I'm in a relationship with. I would like a relationship where I can feel comfortable and secure not stressed and angry because I always have to deal with racist remarks or jokes from them or their family. I've always preferred black guys but I've given up on them as well. I've come across too many black men who are anti-black women and it really disgusts me. It's so acceptable for black men to bash black women but you rarely ever see men of other races doing that to women of their own race. Why? why do only black men do that? It just makes them look ridiculous, hateful and pathetic. Their self-hatred is out of control."

We had a few beers and watched some NBA finals games together earlier last month and this came up while we were chilling. According to them ""black girls remind them too much of their mothers and sisters for them to find black girls sexy."" like they could obviously tell when a black girl was pretty... but it wouldn't really make them want to go after her, nor would the black girl peak their interest like a white, latina or Asian girl would. They kinda went on and on about how black girls they wen't to high school with were really loud and how the white girls and Asian girls were more feminine. We didn't go to high school together so I couldn't really say they were being ridiculous though, so I just changed the subject.  Now I have to admit as a black guy myself I have never dated a black girl, but not because of any reasons they were saying. It just happens that no black girls have ever really liked my style or fucked with me lol, which is 100% fine. But my bro's sounded like two borderline racist white guys on reddit trolling, which kinda pissed me off. Now we were like 5 or 6 beers down already before we had that convo but it was still pretty eye opening to me and it will kinda make me question their taste in women for now on. I don't know what the fuck is up with the disconnect between BM and BW but holy shit it needs to stop.   TLDR; My coworkers be trippin"
blackladies,3bwejw,viversemrumo,6,Fri Jul 3 06:44:29 2015 UTC,"I think that's just an excuse, honestly They want to find a way to justify their dislike of black women; it's sad really.

blackladies,3bwejw,worriedaboutlove,2,Fri Jul 3 09:46:00 2015 UTC,"That ""she looks like my mother/sister"" thing is interesting, because isn't it well known that people tend to date people who look like them?

blackladies,3bwejw,HonoluluLion,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:09:06 2015 UTC,"Right, I was thinking the same thing. They're not assholes at all which is why what they were saying kinda confused me, they're two of the coolest/nicest guys I know. But they kinda backtracked and just stuck with ""Black girls just aren't that sexy to me"" so i said fair enough and left it at that. I'm 19 and they're 23 and 24 if that makes any difference  I was in a subreddit the other day and someone suggested that the reason BM don't find BW as desirable as men of other races find their women is because of the way BM and BW are raised. He/She said that BM are kind of coddled and babied by their moms when they're young (8-13) but BW are taught to be ""A strong black women who doesn't need a man"" and that leads to disconnect when BM and BW are both teens/young adults and they often but heads a lot because of it. He was pretty much saying that black men find black women to be good mothers but undesirable wives because of this. Not sure if it has any validity but it was a new take on the problem that I've never heard.   tbh I think porn, music, movies, tv and magazines may have a lot to do with why BM find other women more attractive. Nobody comes out of the womb with a certain taste in women, but I do think that growing up and seeing movies with sexy white girls and hearing music about lightskin or foreign chicks and then seeing 99% of magazines with pretty WW on them AND THEN becoming a teen and discovering porn which is 90% WW can mold your preferences to like WW more than BW.

It just happens that no black girls have ever really liked my style or fucked with me    What's your style if you don't mind me asking?"
blackladies,3bwejw,HonoluluLion,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:02:49 2015 UTC,"Nah it's cool. That's such a hard question to answer, but what I meant by style was that I'm a gamer, coder, introverted, hard worker and funny. If you meant clothes wise, it's usually Adidas, black cargo shorts, black tee, backwards hat and a goodwood necklace. none of those are bad qualities but alot of girls find the introverted-ness mixed with the coding/gaming to be a slight turn off which is understandable. I just happen to run into less black women than white or latinas in my city so there's a lower chance for me to really hit it off with a black girl simply because of population"

blackladies,3bwejw,FAWinner,2,Sat Jul 4 01:58:00 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to disagree with your assertion that ""[i]t's so acceptable for black men to bash black women but you rarely ever see men of other races doing that to women of their own race."" Bashing women of your own race is very common in other racial communities.  For example, there is a very long thread on AsianTwoX (long for AsianTwoX standards, at least) from 10 days ago talking about Asian men who put white women on a pedestal and bash their own women.  I have a ton of Indian friends, and in my experience, Indian men commonly do this as well.  I would suggest that it's pretty common for racial minorities living in a majority white society to bash the opposite sex members of their race.  I think it's not so much a black/Asian/Indian/whatever issue so much as an issue of being a minority in a majority white society and being taught, if only implicitly, that white is better."

I totally agree with you. I never see white men/women bashing their men or women as much as I see it from minorities. I believe a lot of this has to do with colonization and thinking white is better.   As an Indian , I have met Indian guys who bash Indian women, but I have seen it from Indian women as well.   This was posted before, its an OKC profile from two Indian women stating they only date white men. http://imgur.com/a/8ofk6"

I don't have a racial preference.  Looking back, I never did...had all sorts of crushes then and up until a few years ago (haven't really fancied anyone recently).  At the end of the day, I'm still going to have to deal with the same shit from all kinds of men* (racism, sexism, colorism) anyway so I was just eh about pro-IRR/anti-IRR, it didn't matter too much to me.  *I specify men since I have the most experience with them.  Like others have mentioned, be wary of all potential mates.  I guess I'm harder on men, but women could portray the same problems as well.  You know what I find almost hilarious?

I mean, she wasn't well to begin with ... she'd slice up her arms and pass me notes in class telling me that she'd kill herself that day because some wannabe Trench Coat Mafia member wasn't interested in her. He was not fond of people of color, and made no secret of it. Through all this, I remember her telling me how much the hated her black skin, and how jealous she was of her mixed-race baby cousin with green eyes. God, she was a tragic case. She saw her goal through though. Married herself a gnomish-looking Eastern European man, and had his baby.   Thinking about her after all these years brings me such great sorrow.  Anyway, the world is wide, and I've been in many interracial relationships myself. My philosophy on dating has always been ""taste the rainbow,"" and in my experience, one principle always held true; no matter who you find yourself with, the most IMPORTANT thing is that you love and take pride in yourself first."

There are resources online. If someone wants to change, there are opportunities.  I don't think think the idea of having a ""discussion"" about this from ""both sides"" is valid. One side is having their ideas challenged and the other is having their humanity challenged. That's not a discussion, it's something else and it's unreasonable to expect a handful of people to have the energy to deal with all that misinformation and aggression.

It takes work and time to figure out what works for you, but the alternative is leaving yourself in the hands of people who have zero of your well-being in mind.   I'm seeing more and more Black women doing some really interesting things around entrepreneurship. Thing is even most Black or female spaces are still so in love with the mainstream models, that they don't get much attention...like...when praising entrepreneurship from Black women, people will talk all day about something like a STEM-related company all day, but don't seem to give as much credit to the smaller businesses like the one the article mentions...and I get why (and why Forbes is comfortable doing it), but that stuff shapes the way people see their potential."

The fact that she could choose to live in Tuscany or wherever is just another example of privilege some Indians have in America.

They think they're starting a race war. But the catch is, you can't go to war with people who aren't fighting. It's just terrorism and bullying tactics at that point.   I'm baffled about people forgiving him too. It's alien to me for people to do such a thing. But I'm really baffled as to why these terrorist acts haven't been called just that. And why can't the NSA find these terrorists. They can take the time to arrest people for making violent threats towards police officers on facebook, but not find these fools? I don't buy it."
blackladies,3br9nt,meadeater2014,9,Wed Jul 1 21:08:28 2015 UTC,"I'm baffled about people forgiving him too.    Typically forgiveness isn't for the person who did the wrong, it's for the victims or the families of the victims, as a way of letting go of anger and not letting vengeance consume them. You know the saying, ""forgiveness is a gift you give yourself,"" and all that. That's my guess about why some families forgave him so quickly, they just didn't want to hold onto those toxic feelings of fury so they just let go of them. It's in no way condoning what happened, but just saying ""this won't consume me."" In a way, it's kind of the opposite of what Roof wanted."
blackladies,3br9nt,fsmpastafarian,5,Wed Jul 1 23:05:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, thank you. Generally you don't forgive to help the person who committed the wrong, you forgive to help yourself because holding that pain and anger inside of you can be counterproductive in the extreme.   Like, I consider myself a Christian (maybe not a good one, but that's for God to decide), but if someone murdered my mother I'd forgive them - eventually - but that wouldn't stop me from cheering on their life in prison or death penalty sentence.   All that said, why this isn't considered ""terrorism"" and why the NSA/FBI/DHS isn't on this is something I wonder about a lot. I have some suppositions, but...

blackladies,3bpocc,bakerowl,9,Wed Jul 1 03:40:34 2015 UTC,"I'm white and took an African-American literature class once upon a time. I really enjoyed it and it certainly felt enlightening and made me think twice about how literature is taught in the USA. Seems most schools think of ""diversity"" in literature as To Kill a Mockingbird, or other narratives where everything is seen through the eyes of a white protagonist. And I love that book, I'm not sure how black readers feel about it. But I do know real diversity, as in novels written by AAs and featuring AAs as primary characters is what's actually crucial. Hell, that trend is even prevalent in another subset of literature I enjoy (Holocaust lit) -- tons of fiction is presented only through the perspective of a righteous Aryan helping the Jews, instead of the Jews themselves.   As for ""must reads""... -- anything by Toni Morrison.  -- Miss Jane Pittman by Ernest P. Gaines.  -- I Am Not Sidney Poitier by Percival Everett. Anybody who likes dark comedy would love this. -- Dessa Rose! A classic. -- Getting Mother's Body by Suzan-Lori Parks. It's very much like a retelling of As I Lay Dying with a black protagonist. -- The Known World by Edward P. Jones -- Praisesong for the Widow by Paule Marshall might be a favorite. -- The Farming of Bones by Edwidge Danticat, about the Haitian/Dominican conflict  By far, my favorite is one I only discovered recently. It's not as well-written as a Morrison novel but as a sci-fi fan it was right up my alley. Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower. It's exciting dystopia with a black female lead, and damn is it affecting."
blackladies,3bpocc,wolfplanet,6,Wed Jul 1 09:12:21 2015 UTC,"Just adding on to the Octavia Butler train. I love all of her novels. I've read everything she's published (that I know of) at least twice...some things many more times. I also recommend Kindred for people who've never read her before. Her sci-fi is really speculative fiction, so for people who can't handle intense sci-fi you may still like her works. Kindred especially so because it's about American history (slavery) with a little bit of a more modern bridge to that time.  Nalo Hopkinson is another great black (Jamaican) sci-fi writer. Her novels blend Caribbean themes and traditional stories with the cool fantastical worlds of her mind. With her I recommend starting with Midnight Robber (because I really loved it). Brown Girl in the Ring is a great one too.  I wish this concept could become a subreddit. It'd be great to have a place where people could constantly post about black/POC authors and lit they come across. There could even be reviews and news about new works that have come out!"
blackladies,3bpocc,adwoaa,4,Wed Jul 1 14:20:54 2015 UTC,I haven't read a lot of black literature but I second the Toni Morrison suggestion. I also really enjoyed Native Son by Richard Wright.

blackladies,3bpocc,Kamala_Metamorph,3,Wed Jul 1 22:51:14 2015 UTC,"Miss Jane Pittman by Ernest P. Gaines.   I like to imagine that this was a collaborative effort between Ernest J.

Walter Dean Myers- Another well known YA author. ""Monster"" is a quick read but it is quite a page turner! Toni Morrison- I think someone already mentioned her.  Zora Neale Hurston- ""There Eyes Were Watching God"" is a classic  Sharon G Flake- Okay, so she writes for middle schoolers. But in terms of writing about the black experience for young black girls her books are great. ""The Skin I'm in"" is classic for young black girls growing up in the 2000's.    In terms of other POC Authors:   Murakami, Haruki : He's written a lot, ""1Q84"" is a popular one but a really long read. He is a really popular Japanese author.  I also think he translates his own works into english too.  Khaled Hosseini: ""The Kite Runner"" and ""A Thousand Splendid Suns"". He is an Afghan writer.

She has storybooks on kindness, friendship, siblings, segregation, slavery, civil rights, poverty, foster care, I just started ""brown girl dreaming"" a few days ago. If you have a kid in your life, I recommend you get your hands on ""Each Kindness"" and read it to them.   Also, I'm surprised that Zora Neale Hurston isn't mentioned in this post more often. It's definitely a classic according to all the lists I've read.  I'm going to have to break the rule and make one recommendation that isn't a POC author~ ""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" by Rebecca Skloot. It's extremely readable and amazing story about the immortal HeLa cell line, which were taken from a black woman dying of cancer in the... 1950s? Highly recommend it."

From his wiki   Yusef Komunyakaa (born April 29, 1941[2]) is an American poet who teaches at New York University and is a member of the Fellowship of Southern Writers. Komunyakaa is a recipient of the 1994 Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award, for Neon Vernacular[3] and the 1994 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. He also received the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize. Komunyakaa received the 2007 Louisiana Writer Award for his enduring contribution to the poetry world.  His subject matter ranges from the black general experience through rural Southern life before the Civil Rights era and his experience as a soldier during the Vietnam War.

These aren't necessarily the ""classics"" but they were on people's bookshelves last year. I also had to defend why I was asking, so I recommend some of the links in there.   I think the subreddit idea is great, and personally I'd suggest naming it r/50POC or r/50booksPOC because of the livejournal challenge that I'm referencing. I recommend keeping the list pretty gender balanced too, like it should avoid getting to 33/66% ratio for each culture. Here's a bunch of links:    FAQ Why make a special point of reading authors of color? http://50books-poc.livejournal.com/94779.html Why 50 books from POC? Addressing the fears and objections, one year later http://sanguinity.livejournal.com/440141.html http://oyceter.livejournal.com/765031.html   I actually started a 50POC reading challenge about two years ago. I've actually cheated a little bit, since the idea is to read different perspectives than my own, but I've been so thrilled and charmed to read all the books that didn't exist, and that I've missed out on, which mirror my childhood that I haven't spent much time in the adult section or in the other cultures sections.    You were asking for other cultures, here are some good starting points for Asian American lit:   http://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/1ss1q5/any_asian_american_book_recommendations/ http://www.buzzfeed.com/jarrylee/essential-asian-american-writers-you-need-to-be-reading#.opLqdb9v49 https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/37uuph/anyone_want_to_do_an_raa_book_club/ http://www.timpanyu.com/apa-heritage-month-15-classics-of-asian-americancanadian-fiction/ (authors from a reeeally long time ago)   I'm a philistine, so I prefer dipping my toes in by reading young adult lit and younger. I may work my way up to the adult stuff, but sometimes the other cultures are so foreign to me that I feel the younger books are more accessible. So for that, I recommend this link:   We Need Diverse Books (WHERE TO FIND DIVERSE BOOKS) http://weneeddiversebooks.org/where-to-find-diverse-books/    Good luck!

""Ugh no, how dare you call me out for my misogynoir! I'm enlightened as fuck!""   It’s not “respectability politics” for an enlightened man to want someone he can actually RESPECT.   ""What are you saying? No, I would totally date a black woman if one would date me!""   Women today have lost all self-respect, and here you are with the audacity to complain about men who speak their mind about what they consider attractive and admirable in a woman.   ""How dare a woman claim my personal preferences are racist or sexist or both! Maybe I just prefer women who won't call me out, that isn't inherently problematic at all""   No one is obligated to “accept” or “celebrate” your stripper-sensibilities.

But no, that is then trying to justify putting down black women even further than they already are by society itself. Lately I have noticed a lot of comments coming from black and white men just dipped in so much hate, and vitriol for women lately. Personally I don't see the point in making a distinction about what a black woman does that would make me drop them altogether.

blackladies,3bowqp,NSFW895,2,Wed Jul 1 08:10:19 2015 UTC,"I think the increased hate may have to do with the economy and ""new normal"" as far as job hunting goes. I think the need more education (more years spent in college = greater life milestone delays) and lack of job security pretty much gives us a lot of angry young men with too much free time.   That's just more time to comb the internet for misogynist posts, more time on forums that echo chamber that female-directed hostility, as more women are entering the workforce in traditional ""male enclaves"" the more we are ""competition"" and ""inferior wives and mothers"", etc."

blackladies,3bncgi,racist_reddit,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:56:05 2015 UTC,"The question is, ""Can you really afford not to?""  Take advantage of your youth. You have more time to live to learn and not just live and learn. One thing you should do is learn who you are. If not, then one day 20 years from now you'll wake up, look into the mirror and see a stranger because you were afraid of being yourself.  So can you afford it? Absolutely! There is nothing more valuable in this world than time and we all have a finite amount of it. All I am saying is, don't waste time being someone else or not exploring who you are is because you think you can't afford it. What you really can't afford is waste time being anyone but you.  Look. So what if some people don't understand you. It happens. Eventually you'll learn when to give of yourself and how much you want to give (especially in your career). It is ok to hold yourself back.   A a part of this journey of life is knowing when and how to choose your battles.  That is different from changing who you are to feel a part of a group."
blackladies,3bncgi,lottikey,5,Tue Jun 30 22:59:17 2015 UTC,"I basically feel out of place in every social setting. Even during the few protests I've attended, at least one person gave me the same confused look, like ""What's the deal with this guy?"" or ""Does he really understand what's going on?"". The funny thing is that no one has actually said these things to me. I'm probably projecting, but it feels all too real. I could just be misinterpreting body language, who knows?   What makes you feel this way? I'm really curious because you stated that nobody has ever said anything like that to you. I could actually see how you would feel this way if it were something that you've experienced throughout your life but I don't get why you think this if it you've never experienced it.    To be honest though, my upbringing and these interactions have led me to feel somewhat detached from the black community (if there even is such a thing). I don't really feel the visceral reaction that many of us do when an injustice occurs. I just kinda acknowledge that America is fucked up and has always been fucked up. I often feel the need to speak out against the larger injustices that occur; not because I think simply speaking out will do anything, but because I feel I have a moral obligation forced upon me as a black American   This is sad to read. I know you aren't the only black person who doesn't care about the issues affecting us, but it's still very sad. I really don't know what to say about that. But now I can see why you felt out of place and like people were judging you at the protest. You seem like you don't really have an interest in fighting against injustice.

It's not that I don't care, it's that I'm having a hard time comprehending the fact that an entire system is broken. Like from the ground up.

blackladies,3bncgi,pro_creator,4,Tue Jun 30 23:13:27 2015 UTC,"No, you're not a terrible person. You are experiencing a cultural disconnect and it's not uncommon.   Some users in this sub will tear you down for not being 100% woke immediately but it's a process, especially if you are first working on undoing some other processes to get there. Don't let it discourage you. You're worried about underperforming for yourself, and that is being projected. You want to do the right things, say the right things, and you're still trying to figure out what those things are and that's fine, that's normal, and [people] should accept your invitation to be guided by hands that look like yours, by eyes that see what you see.   You're experiencing anxiety because you want to do right by people you feel somewhat unfamiliar with, I think, and it gets better. The bigger part of it is less figuring out what's right by other people in their view but finding out how you want to present your personal self and who and what you want to be accepted for/ as. Just follow your heart, trite as that sounds, and you'll do fine with people. But I think your anxiety is coming from a good place and you just have to find your niche."
blackladies,3bncgi,pro_creator,2,Tue Jun 30 19:23:44 2015 UTC,Thanks! This is a very difficult process for me. Please read my edit though.
blackladies,3bncgi,zimtkuss,2,Tue Jun 30 19:27:40 2015 UTC,"Ah, sorry, just read it and, yeah, I feel you on that.   Like, sometimes my partner comes home and is like ""did you hear/ see XY&Z as related to black in America today?"" and he's hyped and ready to vent and rant and protest and I'm just like ""sigh yeah, I saw it."" And there's this fleeting look of confusion on his face about why I'm not raging against and it's just because sometimes, I have to put up a wall between my personal life and everything else, because I am only one woman and I have chosen my path and I have not chosen to be the next big thing that turns the tide,   I've chosen moderation and the pursuit of personal, spiritual peace. I cannot be at peace believing incorrect things or hurtful things but I can be at peace with myself with observing and aligning myself as needed, because I am only responsible for my own soul. Otherwise, it's just all too much. Some days, none of it even feels real because it so rarely touches me personally, such is the way I've built up my safe spaces and safety nets. I'm in awe of women and men that have more depth, more fortitude and more energies than I, I admire their fire, but I don't have it in me and that's ok, that's just me. But I'm not about to feel guilty about having these safe spaces and these things not touching me, I worked hard to create this space and what I didn't work for was given to me by the grace of others that sought to protect me from them. I choose, instead, to be grateful rather than feel alienated, but it's an active choice that I have to exercise to prevent empathy from turning to apathy."
blackladies,3bncgi,RaHxRaH,3,Tue Jun 30 19:34:45 2015 UTC,"Wow ok. Yeah, I guess you're right. I'm a terrible person. Sorry.   ...why this though?"
blackladies,3bncgi,RhombusBlue,3,Tue Jun 30 19:28:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know, but I'm starting to think I could've been raised better. I'm fortunate enough not to experience racism on a daily basis (as of now) so it's hard to comprehend the severity of the issue. I can read all I want about it but I feel like I wont really get it until something happens to someone close to me. God, I hate how narrow-minded that sounds, but it's true."
blackladies,3bncgi,thestillnessinmyeyes,6,Tue Jun 30 19:38:14 2015 UTC,"Yea, I mean, essentially this is all your own personal journey. Right now, it seems as though you're feeling guilty for not really caring about (or being numb to) issues involving ""the black community"", but why stress about it if you don't really care? You feel as though you're supposed to because everyone else does, but if none of the events from the past few years have resonated with you on a visceral level, you really can't force it. Just shrug it off and do you because that's all you'll be able to do with any sort of authenticity. I'm sure people on the front lines, putting their lives and livelihoods at risk wouldn't really want someone apathetic and indifferent about the whole thing in the trenches, you know? There are tons of people in this sub who honestly don't give a shit about half the stuff that gets posted here, and there are people who are up to their elbows in high-level activism. I wouldn't worry too much about the ""Uncle Tom"" label (unless you're actively shitting on black people to curry white people's favor), but if you're trying to care then educating yourself is a good place to start. I think a lot of us go through the apathetic stage but snap the fuck out of it once we start actively paying attention to the world around us. Some folks in this sub are the type to hold your hand and coddle you through this process and others aren't. And that's how this whole ""deprogramming"" thing works in general. If you're at a place where you feel bad about not caring but actually WANT to care, you have to do the work."
blackladies,3bncgi,RhombusBlue,3,Tue Jun 30 20:17:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's right to say I don't care. That just sounds super shitty. When I hear about these things my first reaction just isn't to take to the streets and start yelling. I just start thinking about how the fuck do we stop this? But I keep drawing blanks. I walk around town and wonder how many of the people I pass view me as less than human. I think about how these tragedies could easily have happened to my own family or myself. I guess I had the idea that if I'm not an activist in the way that you see on television, then I'm a ""race-traitor"". I've been educating myself on the history of white supremacy and yes, it pisses me off, but it also makes me depressed to the point where I don't really feel like going out sometimes."
blackladies,3bncgi,RhombusBlue,5,Tue Jun 30 20:51:20 2015 UTC,"I guess I had the idea that if I'm not an activist in the way that you see on television, then I'm a ""race-traitor""   WHET??!!! LOL! Yea, that might be where you're getting tripped up then, because that's an extreme dichotomy and most people, even in social justice circles, don't function like this. I would encourage you not to feel stressed because you're not out here getting arrested at protests or planning covert operations. I don't think that those are the built-in expectations that come with being black.    but it also makes me depressed to the point where I don't really feel like going out sometimes.   This is understandable, for sure. It helps to take breaks, engage in self-care, make sure you're looking out for your own mental well-being. There were just a couple of articles posted here about how race- and gender-related stress issues uniquely effect black women, so we have to take the time to counterbalance it. Looking out for yourself isn't being an ""Uncle Tom"", it's just survival."
blackladies,3bncgi,lottikey,2,Tue Jun 30 21:13:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not an activist. I don't need to be. I'm also pretty untouched, like you, thanks to a bunch of random factors, like you. I still, at this point in my life do not have a majority of my friends as black people, but I no longer carry that burden, and I am friends with who I am friends with. My life takes me where it takes me. As I got more comfortable with myself I ran into more black people like myself, who became my friends naturally, not because they were black, which in turn reinforced my self-comfort. When you are still in snowflake land, you can get caught in the 'there can only be one snowflake' mentality, so it prevents genuine friendships. Being more unapologetic about my blackness also upped my compfort levels and made me less afraid to have honest conversation or speak with pride or correct non-black 'friends'. Some of them faded away because they weren't really friends, others come forward and even more fill in the gaps. You will come into your own. It takes time but you will. I know you're stressed about it, but it will get better."
blackladies,3bncgi,RhombusBlue,3,Wed Jul 1 03:50:13 2015 UTC,"Hmm..I think I was similar I guess in the past when it comes to not having a visceral response to racial injustice. I don't think I was a terrible person, though. I just didn't let it sink in/affect me in the same way many of us read terrible news stories everyday but don't necessarily feel an immediate connection to what's going on. I think it can be a way to protect yourself because once you feel that rage with each injustice, life becomes more painful. But it's really a necessary pain. It's the reality of the situation. It causes action, starts movements. Perhaps since you feel you're helpless to solve it, you think it's just another shitty situation humans are in? Believing you are a terrible person isn't going to help you deal with this disconnect."
blackladies,3bncgi,lottikey,3,Tue Jun 30 19:33:46 2015 UTC,"Perhaps since you feel you're helpless to solve it, you think it's just another shitty situation humans are in?    Bingo."
blackladies,3bncgi,RhombusBlue,10,Tue Jun 30 19:50:55 2015 UTC,"Nowadays I'm fearful of whether or not I can trust the many white friends and acquaintances I've accumulated over the years. I often wonder how many of them view me as the ""safe black friend"" who won't make a ruckus (no pun intended) when it comes to black issues, or their token Negro they can pull out when they have to prove they're not racist.   Probably a lot. Waking up to what society is frequently means that to find peace, you have to adjust your social groups. I spent a lot of time in White school/church/groups and I'll tell you, for my own well being, I've had to cut a lot of these people loose. It works out though, because part of getting older is cutting fake friends and these people weren't good friends anyway because they chose not to accept my full humanity.   I get the feeling that they think that I believe I'm superior to them. I really don't. This is actually who I am, and I accept that, but these interactions are always so soul crushing. Like, these are supposed to be my people, right? If not them, then who the fuck else?   Dealt with this in high school and looking back, I get it. They had MANY reasons not to to trust me. No, they weren't nice, but they didn't owe me kinship in that moment.   What I did do, is find Black people who I connected with beyond just being Black...so finding genuine friends, but not limiting my search to White areas, and going into Black spaces to find individuals who fit with me AND understood my racial experiences. Best kind of friends ever.   You'll likely never feel completely comfortable in a social setting again, but you can grow to feel extremely confident in the role you play in any setting. That'll take time though. In the meantime, know that you're at a protest because it's right, not just because you're on a new team (which you seem to get already)."
blackladies,3bncgi,wafflebread,7,Tue Jun 30 17:00:24 2015 UTC,"find Black people who I connected with beyond just being Black   Nitty gritty right here.   Being black doesn't mean you need to have a lot or only black friends and it doesn't mean you can't have white friends. It doesn't mean your white friends won't love you and at the same time, think and say and do some stupid shit as relates to race. The rub is, if they're a friend, a real friend, you'll be able to respectfully communicate your way through those moments should they arise.   My best friends are all black for the most part but they are other black kids that have felt these same ways. Me and my best girl are into punk/ goth shit and tattoos. Me and my best guy are into hentai and video games. They're normal relationships with normal functions and mutual interests, I just don't have to navigate race with them at all which means they settle into place more easily.   But yeah, u/cardboardsoles 's mentor hit the nail on the head. Just do you, be as you as you can be, be the best you that you can be, and the right people will fall in line and love you for you and it won't be hard and you won't have to worry about it. Sometimes it means social pruning. I cut out a lot of white friends a couple of years ago that, they're nice people, we get along one on one with our interests, but they just require too much energy in the way of code switching and race translating and side-eyeing.   But some things are just good manners, regardless of race, and no one should be giving you shit about that, least of all yourself. Holding a door for someone, saying please and thank you and excuse me and helping a person in need, these are all things that happen on the individual level, and, despite how it all adds up and feels, we're all just people and we're all fighting personal battles and every kind gesture is the right gesture if it's coming willingly and from your heart. Don't second guess the best parts of you. Some people are going to be shitty and you're going to be mad that you did anything good for them ever because they didn't deserve it but let that be a testament to your character above theirs."

Yeah like...by college I started paying attention to how a certain set of more...Ruckus-like Black folk acted toward groups of Black people and they really were looking to ""turn people in"". (Even had a Black guy literally threaten to call the police at a friend and I having an argument that wasn't even that heated).   My closest White female friend even recently told me how she noticed a Black guy we went to school with was way nicer to me (White/non-Black friends) than he was to Black women who had Black friends.

blackladies,3bmvvq,ParticularYouth,9,Wed Jul 1 04:42:26 2015 UTC,"This is something I've been thinking about a lot lately as I'm in the process of talking to a bi-racial (Black/White) guy who's acculturated White. He once told me when he was growing up, the women he thought would like him didn't, and I'm quite sure he meant Black women. He's very good at talking to me as an individual, but I can tell he's mad-confused/uncertain when interacting with me on a romantic level. Even though I date White guys, I'm 100% sure we wouldn't have connected if we hadn't been in a shared social space...partially because he isn't a White guy despite being raised by a White family in a White community. His interaction with the world is very different than mine or a White person's (or any other monoracial person) because he didn't have the racial security/certainty I did coming up.    How it makes me feel...I've wondered how he'd feel about my hair (it's natural) and my skin color specifically...though not my body, as I've noticed him checking me out and he's made a point of referencing his attraction to certain unmistakably Black women. I do though, know we'll have some stuff to work through. I was raised around quite a bit of Whiteness, so I know that part of me is more comfortable for him, but I'm deliberate in not suppressing Blackness around him (speech pattern/volume, discussions of hair, food, and family, social issues...though I'm easing into that since it can be tricky with him identifying so closely with Whiteness).  Looking back, I think this guy had/has the phobia you mention too. I see where he was HIGHLY nervous and bashful to talk to me (to the point of blushing and sweating), and I think a lot of that came from unfamiliarity...and I see why. Talking to him has made me realize some of the expectations I've developed around being approached after being raised around a lot of Black and Latin men. Even White guys where I'm from either are cool approaching a Black woman (in their own way) or they're not...even Asian dudes who've flirted with me have been more direct than this guy, and I think it all comes from confusion.   As far as working on it...the one thing I would say, is to steer clear of listening to Black men...LOL...but seriously. Don't...especially under 50...something about older generations of men before they felt they had free access to White women...they seemed to address Black womanhood for what it was (with issues of patriarchy/misogyny of course), but not in relation to Whiteness. You'll pick up on a lot of stereotypes (like us being superwomen who don't want/aren't deserving of softness and protection) or will pick up on a lot of confusion that you'll see being worked through right on this sub. It's sad to say, but they don't know us that well culturally (I'm sure you know how to connect individually) and you'll probably get some bad guidance.   **oo...and, it might be helpful if you pay attention and work to become aware of the Mexican-brand anti-Blackness you may have picked up from your particular family. Everybody has it, but knowing your own will help."

That being said, I think a lot of it is more to do with the spirit of celebration that's going on right now. That's a lot easier to get involved in. The difference is in joining a parade vs. a funeral procession. The former is just much more emotionally accessible even if you're not directly involved/ influenced. Everyone loves a party! -_-"
blackladies,3bj8ov,thestillnessinmyeyes,10,Mon Jun 29 18:39:13 2015 UTC,You also forgot that it's popular to support homosexuality.
blackladies,3bj8ov,Mur-cie-lago,48,Mon Jun 29 19:03:27 2015 UTC,"I dunno if popular is the right word so much as easier.  Gay marriage just means letting two people mind their own gay business and you mind yours and that's as far as the problem really goes. Participating in the dismantling of white supremacy requires time, energy, education, critical thinking, shining a light on oneself, etc."
blackladies,3bj8ov,thestillnessinmyeyes,30,Mon Jun 29 19:12:36 2015 UTC,Gay marriage is low hanging fruit for LGBT rights. There's no good arguments against it and even apathetic people figure that it's only fair.  Campaign for healthcare access for trans folks or for gay-inclusive sex ed and support starts to dwindle.
blackladies,3bj8ov,Aisren,7,Mon Jun 29 22:54:45 2015 UTC,This is spot on.
blackladies,3bj8ov,Mur-cie-lago,3,Tue Jun 30 03:08:58 2015 UTC,"I agree, I remember a quote when growing up, ""what's popular isn't always right, what's right isn't always popular"", I see this more and more each passing day."
blackladies,3bj8ov,thestillnessinmyeyes,5,Mon Jun 29 19:20:49 2015 UTC,"""Popular"" only works if the idea is accessible to the lowest common denominator, the layman and the ""not too bright.""   Another point, the gay community, for the most part, was all in on this together, they celebrate in unison. We still got black folk out here like they have no idea what's going on and if we just mash our big soft lips into Whitey TM's lily ass a little harder, everything will be O.K."
blackladies,3bj8ov,thestillnessinmyeyes,9,Mon Jun 29 19:27:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to point out that I think the gay rights movement has much more traction than highlighting black issues because they have white support, especially from the white elite/white celebrities."
blackladies,3bj8ov,CarlSaganEuphoria,10,Mon Jun 29 19:41:49 2015 UTC,"especially from the white elite/white celebrities   And, I could be wrong, but I think this ties back into my point about kissing white butt. The majority of celebs of color just sort of... stop talking about these things once they get to a certain level because, I assume, it hurts their bottom line/ prospects."
blackladies,3bj8ov,Mship2,3,Mon Jun 29 19:45:48 2015 UTC,Yeah :( That's true.

blackladies,3bj8ov,lottikey,4,Tue Jun 30 15:13:59 2015 UTC,"Not according to many of the Christians I know, family and otherwise.   One family friend say that the US is the new Sodom and Gomorrah.   But you are right, almost none of my white friend said shit about black lives matter.  Hell, they hardly said anything about Charleston."
blackladies,3bj8ov,eroverton,8,Mon Jun 29 20:49:04 2015 UTC,"I kinda don't get the Sodom and Gomorrah argument being tied to now. I had a Christian fundamentalist fr...acquaintance start raging at me out of the blue about how God's going to get this country now. But I'm thinking... why would he think now is the time? I mean, there was a lot of homosexual domestic bliss going on all this time, just sans the legal docs. This law doesn't magically create homosexuals. But if, as you say, gayness earns the wrath of God, then why should the change in legal status make the difference? God was waiting to hear what the Supreme Court had to say first? I just... o_O Mind you, I am a person of faith myself, so to be fair, I comprehend his concerns. I just find it SUPER WEIRD that with alllllllll the other stuff going on right now (or before now), you think that is the tipping point for America. But then, I am Black and he is not. So I guess ""legal gay"" is the most frightening concept he can think of. For me, it's ""cops with no witnesses nearby."" But that's me, tho.  Anyway, so I am trying to derustle his jimmies by making the point that this is not as big of an the end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it level thing he thinks it is, so I say ""Well, this country has far bigger sins on its conscience to worry about, if we're concerned about divine wrath,"" and I'm thinking... slavery, native genocide, wars on false pretenses, puppet governments, mass exploitation, systemic oppression, state-sponsored murders... and he goes, ""I know. Like abortion.""  I'm like ""..."" bruh. Here, these are for you. See this is why. White people, I can barely. White republicans, I cannot. White fundamentalist republicans... No. Just no."
blackladies,3bj8ov,Mur-cie-lago,4,Mon Jun 29 22:28:11 2015 UTC,That painful of a cognitive dissonance should be considered a disorder.

blackladies,3bj8ov,Mur-cie-lago,8,Tue Jun 30 09:46:49 2015 UTC,"Lol, I love the Christian logic behind the Sodom and Gomorrah comment........It's like hmmmmmmm, if homosexuality was happening in B.C. Era, what the fuck makes you think it wouldn't happen in this day and age......maybe the god you worship isn't so omnipotent if you think human being aren't going to change their thought process."
blackladies,3bj8ov,RaHxRaH,0,Mon Jun 29 21:01:25 2015 UTC,"By this same reasoning, I am equally as baffled as the ""but white people are our friends now!"" argument. This shit they were doing to us with FULL PERMISSION from one another not even 50 years ago is magically cured and they're all enlightened and loving now? Oh... oh... oh.. o-okay."
blackladies,3bj8ov,thestillnessinmyeyes,2,Tue Jun 30 11:58:15 2015 UTC,"100% agree, I tried to explain to a friend(distant after our argument) how the government during both WW1 & WW2 purposefully found ways to EXCLUDE Black Americans for joining the war because they felt they were ""inferior"" and couldn't process the mentality that is war like their white counterparts. He thought I was bashing(which I was in terms of honestly) for old sins and that black people ""NOW"" have a better place in America than in the past, sometimes people can't hear the stupid come from their lips."
blackladies,3bj8ov,grambleflamble,6,Tue Jun 30 12:11:27 2015 UTC,"but even when we have victories, does this country even celebrate them like this?"
blackladies,3bj8ov,thestillnessinmyeyes,22,Mon Jun 29 18:43:08 2015 UTC,When was the last time we had a nationwide victory of this size that positively affected a large portion of the black community? I can't even think of one. And that's sad in and of itself without comparing it to any other struggle/ celebration.
blackladies,3bj8ov,zimtkuss,11,Mon Jun 29 18:46:49 2015 UTC,"nationwide victory of this size   well, 2008 rings a bell."
blackladies,3bj8ov,thestillnessinmyeyes,6,Mon Jun 29 19:58:25 2015 UTC,"True. But, go with me here, that was a victory for one man that... hasn't really paid off for the bunch in the eyes of a lot of people. Don't get me wrong, historically speaking, it was huge. But how many average black citizens benefitted from that? SCOTUS just legitimized the unions and sexual identities of millions and is going to allow them to take the next step in their family plannings. Barak winning did... what? for present day black Americans? Actively I mean?   -edit--  Pls don't misunderstand, I'd vote for him every time, regardless and I say that unabashedly and unreserved, I would have voted for almost any black candidate on principle."
blackladies,3bj8ov,zimtkuss,6,Mon Jun 29 20:05:43 2015 UTC,"Because there are no laws on the books that deny Black people rights at this point in time, there is no action any president can take that will dramatically, in one fell swoop, overturn and enact a change that affects all Black Americans. All change from here on out is incremental and has to do with changing peoples minds, breaking down stereotypes and glass ceilings, and paving the way.   Barack Obama has put more people of color into Cabinet and high level positions than anyone else. This over time should help bring more people of color into higher level positions, and their perspectives are much needed at the table. Children who aren't athletic and cant sing can look at Obama and know there's greatness available for them too. His image and words reaffirm that Black people can be articulate and intelligent and don't have use their talent to be a sidekick to the white main character ( no offense to former Secretaries of State Powell and Rice). It's also helpful that he does not have an anglo name at all.  Basically what I'm saying is can you think of one simple law or supreme court judgement that will immediately affect all Black people in America? Our problems have changed considerably, and are much more difficult to deal with because most  racism today is simply a lot of habits, ideas and preferences people don't realize aren't ""innocent"". Who gets passed over for a job, and who gets steered to a high rate loan is not something encoded in our laws, its cultural. No one legal can change that."
blackladies,3bj8ov,thestillnessinmyeyes,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:03:15 2015 UTC,"I never said it wasn't a good thing for black people to have a black president, the question was why aren't people crying in the streets for black people like they are for gay marriage right now and I said I don't think getting a black president is as emotionally accessible for blacks and non-blacks to celebrate the same way. Context."
blackladies,3bj8ov,grambleflamble,0,Tue Jun 30 10:51:34 2015 UTC,"I didn't say you don't think its a good thing for black people to have a black president. You asked how many average black americans benefitted from his election, and I laid out how, based on what I see. I also asked if you can think of any legal one fell swoop kind of action that is even possible at this point, because I can't, and I think that's important to the kinds of victories we're going to have.   Additionally elsewhere in this thread, I and others described people celebrating in the streets crying and strangers hugging each other, but I figured that didn't need rehashing."
blackladies,3bj8ov,thestillnessinmyeyes,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:43:35 2015 UTC,"You asked how many average black americans benefitted from his election   I'm sorry, I thought I typed it, I meant actively, rather than passively, practically rather than in theory. Like, being able to walk to the courthouse and get the physical marriage license you've been waiting for for the past 20 years is a practical victory. Having a top notch black role model is a passive benefit rather than an active one, if that makes sense. Arguably a more important one by some measures! But passive and not practice. So I'm weighing the difference between a handful of cabinet members and, you know, a few million people being able to actively go out and physically do something they were previously unable to do. I think the latter is just more accessible, not better or anything like that.   But no, I agree, I can't think of anything short of something like others have mentioned, drug reform + pardons or a wave of restitutions. Honestly, I really thought all these states legalizing marijuana would be releasing hoards of inmates but I was woefully wrong."
blackladies,3bj8ov,grambleflamble,7,Tue Jun 30 19:17:19 2015 UTC,"I hear what you're saying and agree with your points. I was going off of this thought train that led to your comment:   but even when we have victories, does this country even celebrate them like this?   Facebook/Twitter blew up just as hard, people crying in the streets, etc."
blackladies,3bj8ov,RaHxRaH,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:10:08 2015 UTC,"Was it not like that in 08? (Legit question, I was 100% emotionally absent that year so I have no clue how that all went down.)  I just remember a bunch of UMD grads being really up in arms for dude but I don't recall anything after that. I still see white people with Obama stickers in my neighborhood, they like him more than I do."
blackladies,3bj8ov,grambleflamble,8,Mon Jun 29 20:13:07 2015 UTC,"It was an incredible election night. There were huge crowds in most major cities, strangers hugging strangers in the streets, it was something that people were truly celebrating. I've never seen anything like it out of an election in my near four decades.   of course there were salty fucks pouting, just like now with gay marriage, but the positivity drowned them out for a good while. I wish it would have lasted. I wish a lot of things had come from the last 8 years, but I'll never, ever forget that night."
blackladies,3bj8ov,alwaysfrombehind,8,Mon Jun 29 20:18:53 2015 UTC,"You're right, that's true. I wasn't thinking of the scale. I really can't think of anything this big that has happened for us. sigh"

blackladies,3bj8ov,alwaysfrombehind,8,Mon Jun 29 20:01:59 2015 UTC,"I think that had there been a way to add, for example, the Obama logo over your profile picture in the same way you can rainbow-ify your profile pic now, it would be similarly as popular. I know that I would do it. (I made status updates after both 2008 and 2012 on the Obama win, including a photo I made of Obama with pixelated sunglasses and ""Deal with it"" written across the bottom in 2012. I know of at least one family member who de-friended me over it.)  But I think it's more of a matter of ease, unfortunate as it may be. It would be interesting to see a movement do something similar now (say, add an icon that states ""black lives matter"" over your current profile pic, in the same way as you can do with the rainbow), and see what happens."
blackladies,3bj8ov,RaHxRaH,6,Mon Jun 29 20:19:54 2015 UTC,"true, this flag avatar thing is what, two clicks and boom?   I remember seeing a lot of ""change"" logos as avis back then, though, too."
blackladies,3bj8ov,zimtkuss,4,Mon Jun 29 20:38:59 2015 UTC,"I do remember that too (the change logos). That was still the matter of changing your photo, where as this is as simple as a few clicks. AND Facebook had the link on your page if you wanted to do it, you didn't even have to look it up on your own."
blackladies,3bj8ov,nappers_delight,4,Mon Jun 29 20:41:37 2015 UTC,"lol you got me.   but do you think that had the same impact as this? Obama has disappointed a lot of people with regards to race relations.   Can his election be compared to a large scale victory like this? To me what would be comparable is meaningful police/justice system reform on a national scale as a result of the black lives matter movement. That would have a impact on the daily lives of black people across the country.   edit: as far as celebration, I think you're right to point out Obama's election. I was in 8th grade and wasn't paying much attention that year, so I didn't immediately think of it."
blackladies,3bj8ov,kitcat_kittycat,3,Mon Jun 29 20:44:32 2015 UTC,"Well I was an adult at the time, and it was electrifying. I had voted absentee from my home state and traveled down to DC for election activities and election night. People ran in the streets, waived the flag out of windows, car windows, and used it as a cape. Crowds ran in front of the White House chanting "" who's house? Obama's House"" and that Goodbye song. People honked their horns like mad, and strangers of all races hugged each other in the streets for hours. Facebook and Twitter were on FIRE with Obama stuff for WEEKS.  I was living in DC the second time around but while there were still some celebrations I'd say there was 1/2 as much energy bc plenty of people were already disappointed by the first term. I'm sure you can find footage of this kind of mass celebration online somewhere."
blackladies,3bj8ov,GoddamnCommunist,26,Tue Jun 30 02:50:07 2015 UTC,"A lot of well-meaning white allies probably feel one (or both) of two interconnected ways: First, that by changing their profile pic to a Black Lives Matter pic, they're appropriating the struggle and diluting the message; and second, that this is their time to shut the hell up so that Black voices can be heard more clearly. That being said, there's probably a much higher proportion of white dumbasses who think that just because Jim Crow laws were repealed, racism's over. Those are the same idiots who, ten years from now, are going to try to act like homophobia doesn't exist now that gay marriage is legal."

This is why I don't do it. I don't change my pic because I don't want to appropriate the Struggle.  That said, I think it would be cool to have a Blackout day, where everyone replaces their profile pic with an all-black square in memoriam to the Black and POC lives lost from racism (or more broadly the social, economic, and psychological violence inflicted on POC communities by a white supremacist society).  Or an all-black square with just bold white lettering that spells out the name of a victim of police brutality or race-based hate crime or similar, everyone trying to use a different name to highlight as many lives as possible."

blackladies,3bj8ov,FixinThePlanet,6,Tue Jun 30 03:48:06 2015 UTC,White woman here: would it make anyone uncomfortable if a White ally was to do something like that?

It's getting... mixed reactions. A few think 'well good for her' but a lot think it comes across as appropriation or mockery. I tend to see that as 'eh'. I mean a #BlackLivesMatter hashtag or button doesn't bother me overmuch. As long as you don't go full Dolezal with it. Show up where it matters, vote when it matters, and don't make it all about you, and I'm cool with ya. fistbump  I feel like the changing of the profile pic, though, is not so much about the support but the being seen to support. I've seen maaany cases where it's just a case of Special SnowflakeTM Syndrome: White Edition. at the end of the day you've built a persona for yourself as a paragon of white liberalism and do everything to uphold that notion because you want everyone to know you're not like those other racist white people, you're one of the good ones... ew.

blackladies,3bj8ov,meadeater2014,7,Mon Jun 29 19:43:14 2015 UTC,"Mmm...I think it's caught on more because the quest for marriage equality holds up existing power structures (i.e., homosexual people striving for that straight, White, holy grail of the picket fence, 2.5 kids and a dog) while Black lives actually having value requires them to question the goodness of their idealized police force...it's like the sexual orientation version of Irish becoming White.   Once homosexual (cis, White) couples assimilate, we likely won't be able to tell their behavior from their straight counterparts. Racism is the cornerstone of prejudice in this country, even world (our economy is built on it) and it will be one of the last that people will confront."
blackladies,3bj8ov,mcqueen88,4,Tue Jun 30 00:34:27 2015 UTC,"I saw a blog post today making a similar case. For actual legal change, the push for marriage was about letting rich, cis, white, but gay, men back into the privileged group, rather than actually promoting equality between different people. Also, the massive amount of resources consumed by the marriage campaign subtracted from local direct action support communities.  There are real gains for real people with the gay marriage ruling (granting citizenship to a spouse, hospital visitation, and various logistical and financial benefits), but in terms of advancing equality it's just another iteration of ""Dear non-white or trans or disabled or poor people, we know you were next in line, but due to unforeseen circumstances we had to change up the priorities. Please wait your turn."""

I personally would rather invest energy in those. I am not so sure if op really means for her subreddit to be satire. My experience on reddit is anything with hate in the subreddit name either is or rather quickly turns into a cesspool.

Ironic, though, that they work so hard at ""forgetting the past"" and that is why they are so effectively repeating the thought-processes and rationalizations slave owners used.  I swear, the next actor to portray a slave owner should just go on an modern all-white slave cabin tour and take notes in order to more effectively understand the mentality of their character."
blackladies,3bii6a,garnetsquarefro,18,Mon Jun 29 15:10:57 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking. They essentially haven't changed at all. Any move we make in freedom or to gain freedom looks like slave rebellion to them.

The misinformation out there is astounding. An untrained person would have no idea what is fact and what is fiction. I'm hoping to go back for a MA in public history so I can start a career that helps spread historical literacy, because ignorance of the past is such a huge part of our current issues relating to race (and a ton of other things).  The only good news I can think of is that I know for sure there are museums and historic sites that are doing a fantastic job of interpretation among youth right now that curbs some of these misconceptions about slavery really early on. Helping young children understand the experiences on a human level instead of abstractly is definitely a good start.  Anyway I guess my point is that this article frustrates me but doesn't surprise me. And I hope I'll get the opportunity to join some great museums and sites to work on correcting some of this ignorance in my future career."
blackladies,3bii6a,geshikhte,13,Mon Jun 29 17:21:07 2015 UTC,"helps spread historical literacy   Like...I knew people were ignorant, but I'm learning about new, scary levels these days.

Helping young children understand the experiences on a human level instead of abstractly is definitely a good start.   What gets me about slavery is...like...how can you possibly think being owned is EVER a good situation...unless of course you assume the people who are owned don't have basic human impulses and desires...which sounds very familiar."
blackladies,3bii6a,geshikhte,21,Mon Jun 29 18:16:38 2015 UTC,"For modern audiences, of all races really, slavery in the U.S. a hard concept to grasp. They've never experienced it personally. They've never known anyone who experienced it. A lot of what they were taught, especially if they are a little older, was really incorrect or simplified. It's really easy to think of slavery as this abstract thing that didn't affect anyone. In today's world of social media, it's easy to have really wrong opinions and find other people who will back you up on them or think you're smart. So there's just a lot of crazy stuff that goes unchecked.  Anyway, there's a really cool activity I heard about. I don't remember which historic site it's at, but I believe it's one of the Virginia ones. When they have groups of school kids come, they inevitably get questions about ""Why didn't the slaves just run away?"" Because for a kid that's a common sense solution to the problem, right? So they put the kids in an unfamiliar place with a really vague/inaccurate map and have them try to figure out the way to freedom. They see that it wasn't so simple after all. It's a pretty awesome way to show and not tell, and I think kids probably come away with that remembering it for a long long time.  EDIT: Also to address this:   What gets me about slavery is...like...how can you possibly think being owned is EVER a good situation...unless of course you assume the people who are owned don't have basic human impulses and desires...which sounds very familiar.   You have a lot of people who were taught the paternalistic junk. They think, well, they were better off being cared for by the awesome rich white people because surely they couldn't care for themselves. Where would they be without these great white people who gave them food and shelter and clothing?! They kind of forget the part where they (or their parents, grandparents, great grandparents) were brought here against their will.

blackladies,3bii6a,midwestprotest,6,Mon Jun 29 21:54:28 2015 UTC,African history is hugely lacking in the U.S. educational system. Even in my old university department when we hired an African historian it was impossible to get her classes to fill unless we made them gen eds. Part of this is just fear of the unknown -- smart kids not wanting bad grades because they're afraid they won't understand the material. Another part is this attitude in the U.S. that Africa isn't really worth our time compared to other areas of the world. It's sad because it's a really diverse and interesting area to study. I wish the African historian would have been hired while I was still a student so I could have taken a class with her.

Of course Thomas and Sally came up and you got people parroting how he ""let"" his offspring with Sally work in the house. As if working in the house was better.  The narrative of house slaves having it better than the others needs to die a quick death. House slaves received some of the harshest and cruelest treatment; which is one of the reasons why the overwhelming majority of runaways were slaves who worked in the house.   I'm tried of revisionists acting as if working in the house was some golden ticket to an easy life as a slave"
blackladies,3bii6a,midwestprotest,8,Mon Jun 29 19:58:31 2015 UTC,"I was reading a Reddit thread a week or so ago about rape and slavery.   Was this the one where people legitimately tried to argue that since slaves were property, they couldn't get raped?"
blackladies,3bii6a,geshikhte,13,Mon Jun 29 22:29:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, smh. Conveniently, that thread popped up a few hours after I and another guy pointed out in another thread that so much rape happened during slavery that the average Black Americans are damn near 1/4 White.   Reddit being Reddit, I guess these fools couldn't take our word for it and had to start a thread in AskHistorians. The posters in AskHistorians confirmed it.   As a side note, people irk the hell out of me when Black people tell their history and they don't want to believe it. As if the randoms at AskHistorians would know more about Black people than Black people. I hate that with a passion.   Anyway, after the info was confirmed, of course Reddit's resident jackasses and racists had to find a way to twist because the ""Black men rape our women"" narrative blew up in their faces. The twist was ""well, they were property and an owner can do whatever they like with their property"".  The sheer desperation was hilarious and satisfying."
blackladies,3bii6a,extroire,10,Tue Jun 30 00:50:27 2015 UTC,"As if the randoms at AskHistorians would know more about Black people than Black people. I hate that with a passion.   I completely understand where you're coming from, but I think in this instance that might be a bit unfair. The flaired users over there are actually historians by training, many of them specializing in African American history topics. Some are black themselves. Some aren't, but like the white lady who wrote the linked article, have dedicated their lives to studying slavery. As an historian I can tell you that saying that historians shouldn't be consulted in legitimate historical questions isn't going to help the problem. Because yes, black people should know black history but not every single black person is speaking from a place of historical knowledge. It's easy to criticize white people for parroting information, but sadly black people have been exposed to a lot of inaccurate information too.  An example of this is a certain independent African American history museum where I live. I am so so so glad it exists because otherwise the stories of the people it covers would go untold and it's a particularly important story. However, the person in charge of it has no historical training. I was there for research and heard him telling a completely made up story to a group of school children. It was a great story that really got them interested, but it wasn't factual at all.  Another example is when I started working where I currently work (government) and an older black man who had been there forever gave us a tour of the campus. He pointed to an interpretative panel in an historic building and made a claim that the guy in the picture died because he wanted to free slaves. In reality he was pointing to Philip Barton Key, who was shot in the middle of the day in public for having an affair with his killer's wife. Everyone else in my group went ""ahh, wow"" and nodded.  So yes, I understand completely that it's frustrating to be second guessed all the time about something to which you feel you have a strong connection. But just because you and a lot of other people are right some of the time doesn't mean everyone who is black is right about black history all of the time, and it's not good to encourage people to not double check things with actual experts."
blackladies,3bii6a,extroire,7,Tue Jun 30 01:49:26 2015 UTC,"I agree. Historians should definitely be consulted.   I just get frustrated when some things or common knowledge (or should be), yet people either don't know or are willfully ignorant.   I think a lot of the consulting on this board, when it comes to Black history, are people who are willfully ignorant or who want to find some tiny little morsel in the historical evidence to use to dispute what people say.  No American should ever have to consult with a historian to find out whether it is true that slave owners raped slaves."

blackladies,3bii6a,bloodReturn,5,Tue Jun 30 15:22:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly. People not knowing basic important things kills me. I really hope I get to make it my life's goal to spread fact and inform everyone of all the stuff, good bad and neutral, that brought us to where we are today. But that comes with the assumption they will care/listen. And that's the harder part."
blackladies,3bii6a,geshikhte,3,Tue Jun 30 11:13:03 2015 UTC,"So yes, I understand completely that it's frustrating to be second guessed all the time about something to which you feel you have a strong connection.    No, you actually don't. Your really long post about how some black guy was wrong once is misplaced."
blackladies,3bii6a,bloodReturn,5,Tue Jun 30 01:58:47 2015 UTC,"I'm saying that I understand feeling ownership of history, and feeling frustrated when people doubt your own understanding of where you come from. It's the same way I feel about Jewish history, for example. But that doesn't mean that Jews know Jewish history 100% and should be taken at their word without any double checking. Because that could cause misinformation about important things (Israel, the Holocaust, etc.) to spread to even more people.  If you know your shit (which it seems like you do), I beg you to share it with everyone who will listen and not get discouraged when they doubt you because you are telling fact and that's everything. But please don't talk about historians, some of whom are also black, as if they are useless. Knowledge is power and can only help in the fight against racism and hate."
blackladies,3bii6a,ParticularYouth,10,Tue Jun 30 02:05:12 2015 UTC,"I read the comment as an indictment against redditors who will believe random [white] people over black people simply because they don't think black people are knowledgeable or credible. In this example, the black people who spoke about their own understanding of black history were shot down. Why?   What reasons did they have to not trust what black people said about slavery? I mean, they didn't go to AskHistorians to learn more -- they went there to be proven right about how black people were wrong. I don't think it's unfair to criticize white people and their lack of facts concerning black history. I also don't think it's easy to criticize white people at all, given the level of hate black people get on reddit simply for existing.    But please don't talk about historians, some of whom are also black, as if they are useless. Knowledge is power and can only help in the fight against racism and hate.   Historians aren't useless but people have used AskHistorians with racist intent. I also don't get ""discouraged."" I'm simply a realist who recognizes that ""knowledge is power"" really only works in favor of those with power."
blackladies,3bii6a,ParticularYouth,6,Tue Jun 30 02:35:32 2015 UTC,Thank you for clarifying. I understand your intent now. I agree that it's bullshit that likely white likely male redditors use AskHistorians to try to prove you wrong or justify their racism. I'm glad though that it's a good and well moderated community that is there to concur with you to shut them down. It sucks that until they hear it from experts they discredit it.
blackladies,3bii6a,eroverton,7,Tue Jun 30 02:41:02 2015 UTC,Yeah...that definintely ties into the point the article mentioned of some people only evaluating the hardships of slavery based on physical suffering.
blackladies,3bii6a,ParticularYouth,6,Mon Jun 29 22:31:31 2015 UTC,"What gets me about slavery is...like...how can you possibly think being owned is EVER a good situation...unless of course you assume the people who are owned don't have basic human impulses and desires...which sounds very familiar.   Echoing statements about paternalism that were in other replies, every single person in the US begins as property of their parents. We don't look at it in this light, because it makes our laws seem arcane and gross, but for most people, the first couple decades of your life you are very technically ""owned"" by your parents. Before laws limiting abuse and child labor, it was much less a technical ownership and very much involved gross philosophies about spoiling the rod, spare the child and such. Many people still parent with a heavy hand and resent laws that restrict their ""parental rights"".  The thing is, most people's parents do actually have their children's best interests at heart, and when you become an adult (setting aside adult dependant situations) you are automatically legally emancipated. And so people are largely on board with owning children ""for their own good"" because our society is very invested in that narrative.  So when you feed people the idea of women as being carefree and ""child-like"", people will rationalize husbands gaining ownership over wives, ""for their own good"".  When you feed people the idea of an entire race being ""the child race"", as another commenter pointed out... With narratives like ""Black people are undereducated!"" Or ""Look at the Black Person enjoying watermelon and fried chicken! It's just like how children take such great joy in the little things in life! I wish I could go back to that carefree time, but I am a White Adult with Serious Adult Responsibilities."" Or you could go with narratives about lack of Adult Male Role Models leading to young Black men not learning how to Adult properly. Whatever. The point is that there is still this idea that Black Americans are deep down just not mature or able to Adult and that they should be happy to have that job at Walmart where all their decisions are made for them. Shit, Walmart will even do your budget for you! How helpful and not at all patronizing!  All that paternalism makes sense when you look at the first 18 years as ""bow to authority figures"" training."
blackladies,3bii6a,eroverton,5,Tue Jun 30 00:47:10 2015 UTC,"All that paternalism makes sense when you look at the first 18 years as ""bow to authority figures"" training.   I went to a high school that made some decent efforts in trying to break that pattern (as much as possible within the educational system)...allowing students to choose areas of study, no need to ask the teachers to leave, etc.   Certain administrators and visiting instructors could NOT handle students making their own decisions, even when faced with zero behavioral, safety, or educational issues.   Your whole post just has my stomach sinking thinking of the implications in work/adult life, specifically the food/child-like example...I used to work with a woman...Black actually. Who used to go to extra lengths to infantilize me in the office (despite the fact that I knew more about the job, we had the same education and I was only 2 years younger) and I didn't report to her. It was creepy, scary, and non-stop.  Thinking of it in relation to work and a project I'm working on right now and just...le sigh"
blackladies,3bii6a,ParticularYouth,3,Tue Jun 30 14:46:11 2015 UTC,"Ugh, sorry about your gross coworker.   I think it is ridiculous that adults in this country act like they have no idea where bullying comes from, when the only consistent example for human interactions that most kids get is that the bigger/older/more adult you are, the more in charge you are. And then when they don't like a rule, rather than explain it, adults default to ""I'm the authority and you should just listen to me"".  I have this aunt who was a preteen when I was born. I really used to look up to her, but I can't stand her now. She refuses to view me as an adult, and she went weirdo fundie a bit ago, which is really out of character for that side of the family. When I was pregnant we went home to visit for a thing. A whole bunch of extended relatives that I had never met and will likely not ever see again were in town. She was bending over backwards to impress them. Apparently our entire side of the family split off from a super religious Midwestern family and moved away a couple generations back, which really explains a lot, actually. Anyway, so these like youth church indoctrination camp running people kept trying to turn everything into Prayer Time, and my aunt had basically specifically cautioned me and my younger siblings to be respectful about it. Apparently respect now means joining in prayer circles led by a dude who spent five minutes thanking Jesus for ""inventing family"", because humans definitely just left their utterly defenseless young children out to dry before Christ came around to straighten them out. Anyway so I held it together through this whole long thing without cracking up and when it was done I made the mistake of making eye contact with my dad. His smirk set me off and as the circle was breaking up I chortled a bit. It wasn't loud, none of the out of town relatives heard me, no big fucking deal and then suddenly smack. My aunt fucking slapped me across the face. A grown ass, pregnant married woman. She then looked at my dad, the person I was giggling with and told him something about ""getting her under control"" and then walked away. She did this all in front of my fucking spouse. Like, wtf? The three of us just stood there in shock like, what just happened?  The best part? My aunt is only a year older than my husband.  But seriously, I spent all weekend putting up with people I don't know and have never met invading my personal space to touch my belly and offer unsolicited advice and creepy prayers, like way above and beyond what should be acceptable, like some of them were basically ""laying on hands"" and trying to fucking call Christ into my utereus, and she slaps me for giggling? Fucking respect goes both ways, and you just lost mine.  Ugh."

I still love her husband, but I'm worried he lets her bully their kids a bit, but I'm not around enough to know much about it. He was busy with work that whole weekend, and a year later when we were all on vacation my husband and I told him the story. He was really surprised, and said that she had been stressed that whole weekend, but he agreed it was really out of character. I'm pretty sure he is waaaay less religious than she is, so I think much of her recent weirdness is concerning to him too.  On bullying: ""My kid got in trouble for bullying at school so I smacked him upside the head and grounded him why did that not correct his behavior?!??!!"

They were talking about relationships they developed through Twitter, personal and professional, as well as harassment they faced. It's actually amazing how big of an impact Twitter has had on their careers. They've met bosses, fellow writers, editors, etc. People they might not have met any other way. But the harassment they face is  unrelenting. death and rape threats, general attacks on them, plus more subtle BS responses to their tweets pretty much every single day. The more followers, the more trolls.   So the writer they're quoting is talking about how it's a shame when the harassment leads to these women leaving Twitter. They're giving up incredible opportunities for their careers, as well as a platform for their voices to be heard. But as you can imagine, dealing with this harassment every day is incredibly taxing.  edit: also, the more you talk about gender and race issues, the more harassment you face."

That's something people suffer from regardless of socioeconomic class--a lowgrade depression as a result of the weight of living with racism.  Comfort eating."
blackladies,3bh199,catofnortherndarknes,10,Mon Jun 29 05:12:20 2015 UTC,"My gosh how did I forget this! YES! You are so right, mental health is so overlooked in our communities! Too often are mental issues regarded as ""white people diseases"" and that anything you have is either brought on by something you did, all in your head, or can be prayed away with a sit in church or two and if it doesn't go then you aren't trying enough. We need mental health support like everyone else and unfortunately as neglected as mental heath is in the US in general it's even worse for us and I totally agree that people find unhealthy ways to cope."
blackladies,3bh199,Zanovia,8,Mon Jun 29 05:22:53 2015 UTC,"Obesity is evidence of a whole range of issues in mental and physical health for black women. As black women, I think we've done a great job closing the gap in educating ourselves about our  health. We still hesitate to seek help and I think that is largely due to our history and economics.   It goes much deeper than being able to identify the symptoms and seeking help.  Another issue arises when we seek professional help, our needs continue to be brushed off. Even here in this subreddit I've read stories where women seek professional help and run into a whole host of issues with doctors, therapist, psychologists, etc not understanding issues that are specific to African Americans, women specifically, and mental health even more so.   A lot of it I place largely on education as we've were deliberately placed on the 400+ years slow track in education.  K - 12 we learn the same things over and over in Black history. Never once did we learn about the day to day life of a slave and the physical/psychological impacts we still see today. We learn about the Civil War and the psychological, economical impacts of that (brother against brother, etc).  I took psychology in HS and college. Never once did we go over psychological impacts of the American slave system. We learned about Pavlov and his dogs which took place years after slavery, but never once about the human psychological conditioning on the same line of study on a far larger and dangerously impacting scale. I know graduates of psychology and sociology with Masters degrees who never once covered it. That kind of study doesn't happen until doctorate level or a specialized study. This is a problem. This should be taught as early as Jr HS in education. It could eradicate so many issues we face today."
blackladies,3bh199,cardboardsoles,6,Mon Jun 29 14:16:18 2015 UTC,"Was coming into this thread to post this.  Black women internalize a lot since we have an extremely limited voice.  There's also a matter of genetics and what overweight appears to be to white people.  The othering of normal black bodies.  I'm talking about steatopygia.    When the weight is in the hips and buttocks with a small waist, it's actually a very healthy way to carry it, vs. being in the chest and belly where it's very dangerous."

All the misognoir that floats around us and in the media messes up the mind in a lot of ways and especially if you don't actively dispel the nonsense.

blackladies,3bh199,GeneralBuhari,9,Mon Jun 29 07:20:28 2015 UTC,"The 'strong black woman' stereotype also plays a role. Stress faced by black girls are objectively greater than those faced by whites, but in several studies they under-report the  level of stress they  experience when asked to rate it on a scale. (White girls perceive themselves as facing higher stress than black girls). http://www.springer.com/about+springer/media/springer+select?SGWID=0-11001-6-1390045-0   Tomiyama found that even though black girls reported less stress overall, the effect of chronic stress on weight was stronger, resulting in an 0.8 BMI unit increase every two years for every one unit increase in stress."

When women are sexually abused, one potential defense is to become overweight. Some girls subconsciously hope to ""turn off"" the attacker with their larger body; other girls turn to food for comfort in the wake of a largely unsympathetic society (both within black society and the larger American society).  Until we get real about WHY black women become overweight in the first place, this cannot and WILL NOT be solely an issue addressed by physical activity alone.  http://newsone.com/1680915/half-of-black-girls-sexually-assaulted/  http://www.forbes.com/sites/shenegotiates/2012/04/25/black-women-sexual-assault-and-the-art-of-resistance/"
blackladies,3bh199,Zanovia,14,Mon Jun 29 21:41:34 2015 UTC,"I do consider it a pressing issue. Because my obese little cousin struggles to get up under her own power from the ground. Because my obese aunt can't sit up to reach the remote on the table when she's laying on the couch and she always complains of how much pain she is in, particularly in her joints. While black women do carry the weight differently, I don't think that we carry it as differently as some of us think. If you are big beautiful and fabulous then work it, but after a certain point you can still be an amazing person, but you will no longer be a healthy one. I do think that economic factors play into it, even when healthier food is available it can be hard to work your ass off and then come home and try to cook a meal for your family. However it is possible, and that leads me to another point; many people don't know how to make a quick (or even not quick) healthy meal. There is so much misinformation and just a plain lack of information around food that someone can want to change their lifestyle and when you have been raised with poor eating habits and a bad relationship with food it can be overwhelming. My little cousin that I mentioned previously lived with my mom and I for a few years and I could tell that adjusting to how we ate and such was really hard for her and despite sharing a household with my heath contentious mother we never were able to instill good habits into her while she was with us.  I think one of the biggest hurdles is the cultural issues. I'm sure we have all heard things like ""Only a dog wants a bone, a real man wants something to hold!"" or ""Poor child, look at that no ass, no thighs, here eat up and let's see what we can do"" which is kind of crappy from a body image point of view, but I think it also makes people associate getting fit with rejecting our beauty standards? Like if you want to keep in shape even if that means you lose that booty (which again crappy view of black women; we are so much more than our butts) then you must be trying to get white girl skinny and not have the curves at only Real Black Women have (TM). Even if you fix the food deserts, the misinformation about nutrition, obesity could still be a bigger issue among us if it's ingrained in the culture and people see weighing 300 lbs at 5'0 as merely ""thick""."
blackladies,3bh199,GeneralBuhari,4,Mon Jun 29 04:33:48 2015 UTC,"There is so much misinformation and just a plain lack of information around food   Basically. I think it boils down to education about the effects of racism (stress/depression and availability of healthy food), as well as addressing cultural issues surrounding food sizes and the homogenised black body genetics in America (""black women have curves,"" as if African women without curves are  less black). Food portions or amount of calories in America are grossly unhealthy regardless of food quality or exercise levels, and I think that's the biggest difference between traditional African diet (bulkier, less calories or portions) and Western ones. You'd also be hard-pressed to find a food you can put together in 10 minutes in an average Nigerian home."

My mother is an ex health practitioner and she still doesn't seem to have any clue about diet at all. She refuses to eat anything other than meat and bread, drinks nothing but soda and juices, works out, and then wonders why she doesn't lose weight and her joints and auto-immune issues are wrecking her.

Fad diets get lumped in with this so people take ANY talk of proper, whole food, complete nutrition, as a ""fad"" and discount it in favor of what is familiar, which is that stupid fucking Pyramid we all had shoved down our throats in grade school that is just dead. ass. WRONG.   Inconvenient truths. There is no shortcut. There is no easy way. High nutrient, low calorie [consistent] diet coupled with daily exercise is the ONLY way. Despite the loud noises of every fad diet ever, it's the only way, always has been. Underneath the cacophony of all the other reasons for Americans, or people in general, being overweight, is the inconvenient truth that there are no short cuts, no halfways, no easy ways out, just diet and exercise.

I would also say that diet is 90% of why people do not lose weight. To burn 100 calories you have to do something like 20 minutes of moderate walking. 100 calories is 1/6th of a Big Mac. To burn off an entire McDonald's Big Mac meal (1,070 calories) you would have to walk moderately for ~200 minutes (~3 and a half hours). To run it off, it would be 1 1/2 hours.   People aren't going to lose weight just working out, especially if they are overweight already and maintain the same diet. But the weight-loss for skipping the Big Macs or calorie dense, sugary foods and drinks can have people (especially if they are already overweight) lose something like 10lbs/month with no exercise.   If people are interested (and motivated by) weight loss only, I would advise them to change their diet, and worry about exercise later. But for overall health, you are so right that diet and exercise is what needs to happen!"

blackladies,3bf068,KhaleesiBubblegum,21,Sun Jun 28 17:02:15 2015 UTC,"If you are uncomfortable with it then that's fine. Don't feel like you have to be the ""cool girlfriend"" who's down for whatever. You should tell your SO that you are hurt that he deliberately went to a strip club and failed to disclose to you."
blackladies,3bf068,tropfou,3,Sun Jun 28 18:08:24 2015 UTC,"yea i think when it first came up i didn't feel as strongly because we weren't as committed, plus i feel like if you adamantly tell someone they can't do something they just want to do it more, forbidden fruit type of deal. and didn't i want him to feel like he couldn't be honest with me about it. Hence why i probably tried the ""cool girlfriend"" attitude. but even still he chose not to disclose. so i am planning to clearly articulate to him how i feel now.   i just feel like he shouldn't want to go in the first place (outside of it being some special occasion like bachelor parties) at 28 and being with someone for a little over 2 years"
blackladies,3bf068,z960849,6,Sun Jun 28 18:31:14 2015 UTC,If he only goes with friends and less than four times a year than I wouldn't worry about it.  Also him going to one's has NOTHING to do with how have feels about you.
blackladies,3bf068,tropfou,4,Mon Jun 29 02:48:54 2015 UTC,If his friends are all going then that's probably why he went along as well. Just know that his going isn't a reflection on you or how serious he thinks your relationship is. But he definitely should have told you what went down that weekend
blackladies,3bf068,faith_trustpixiedust,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:44:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think he shouldn't want to go to strip clubs because he's in a committed relationship. I think that's hjust you're insecurities talking. That, abd a lack of knowledge of what actually happens in a strip club. I was you 3 weeks ago. Me a d my bf of 2+ years were planning to go to Florida for a vacation, abd he wanted to check out a strip club in Georgia since we'd be driving down there, abd Georgia is famous for their big booty strippers. I was very uncomfortable with the idea, but when I went it turns out it wasn't neari as bad or sexual as I thought. The women don't go out of their way to solicit the men. They ask if you want a dance, abd keep walking if you say no. They're also very nice ladies! I had a very nice, regular conversation about tattoos with a stripper while she danced for my bf, and ny bf wasn't turned on by her. She was just something to watch. He was more turned on by me being their with him than the naked woman dancing for us. I'd definitely go again. It was fun!   It's ok if you're uncomfortable with the idea, but him wanting to go to strip clubs most likely has nothing to do with you or the quality of the relationship."
blackladies,3bf068,faith_trustpixiedust,2,Tue Jun 30 04:16:50 2015 UTC,"i don't expect him to not want to go, i just expect it to be something he would think to ask about in the first place. i think it's great that you and your boyfriend are comfortable enough to go there together. but it still seems like despite you saying it isn't sexual at all, that you did have a sexually charged experience with your boyfriend and him seeing other naked women jiggle for him got him off more with you there or that just got redirected at you?…but idk you guys or your relationship and if that is, or isn't exactly the case, just what it looks like to me at face value. i would't want that happening especially without me there.  i still don't understand the basic idea of a guy in a relationship voluntarily entering a place with other naked women. i don't really care about how pushy the women are or aren't, or whether they are nice. it's the general principle that seems to not to sit well with my ideas of monogamous relationships. maybe that makes me prude or old fashioned.  i don't expect him not to look/be turned on/ sexually attracted to other women, it's going to happen in normal situations. i don't see the strip club as a normal situation i guess."
blackladies,3bf068,faith_trustpixiedust,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:43:07 2015 UTC,"No, it isn't a normal situation. You are totally entitled to your feelings. That doesn't make you a prude. If it makes you uncomfortable then it makes you uncomfortable. Point blank. I'm just trying to show you that when you go together, it's not that bad. I also think insecurities play a part in this as well. I personally would be cool if ny bf went to sms strip club. I'm sure he will, because his best friend from Jamaica is coming to visit the u.s. fir the first time and I'm sure he's going to want to show him a good time. Would you ever consider going to a strip Club with him?"
blackladies,3bf068,raw-sienna,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:38:07 2015 UTC,"i think after this situation i will go with one of my friends just to see so i can say that i know, and then i might consider going with my SO but right now i don't think i could be comfortable."
blackladies,3bf068,raw-sienna,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:13:38 2015 UTC,"That's understandable. I don't think I'd go again with my bf either, but I would definitely go with friends. Maybe even find a male strip club :D"
blackladies,3bf068,lovelyone20,16,Tue Jun 30 17:41:02 2015 UTC,"I understand why you're upset but if it wasnt discussed before hand I don't think you should be mad he didn't tell you, I feel like you're more mad that you don't know him as well as you thought you did for this to be such a surprise. I think you should direct your attention to what you would like for future boundaries and work out something that works for y'all. you have every right to feel what you feel though. And he should definitely treat your feelings with respect and concern so you can move forward as a team."
blackladies,3bf068,CaitCat,3,Sun Jun 28 23:50:08 2015 UTC,"i agree we didn't discuss it enough before hand, and i guess the time we did talk wasn't an explicit enough boundary.. we've talked more and discussed how i feel and it's clear now for the future.   i think i was more upset that the information was withheld, and that he thought it wasn't something he needed to disclose. i have a hard time understanding why in his head it was a default that i would be ok with him going and not knowing. by nature it just seems like something you'd consider how your partner felt before doing? or is that expecting to much? i mean i know some girls would rather just not know, but i feel like that because they would be bothered by it and would just rather not think about it.."
blackladies,3bf068,mylifebelike_oohahh,6,Mon Jun 29 19:58:13 2015 UTC,"I think it is something girls would rather not know. He probably thought it was a dont ask don't tell. I don't think you're expecting too much, no one is wrong your expectations were just misaligned. Maybe I'm too lackadasial (highly probable!!) but I don't think its necessarily malicious for him to not disclose, he probably knew you wouldn't be thrilled but wasn't really trying to hurt you. He probably saw it as like, not your favorite thing but that you would trust him there and as long as he didn't go all the time it would be okay. A lot of guys also probably put going to strip clubs as acceptable until she's me wife. That might be also why he felt like he didn't need to tell you? It sounds weird but some people do think like that."
blackladies,3bf068,mylifebelike_oohahh,2,Mon Jun 29 20:30:20 2015 UTC,"yea, i don't think he was purposefully trying to hurt me by withholding. and from our conversation, he was saying he genuinely never thought about considering how i felt about him going. which kinda hurts but i can get over it."
blackladies,3bf068,thanksforalllthefish,5,Mon Jun 29 23:31:38 2015 UTC,"but if it wasnt discussed before hand I don't think you should be mad he didn't tell you, I feel like you're more mad that you don't know him as well as you thought   This!  And for some reason I feel meh about strip clubs. I just don't like the whole giving someone money aspect.If we are married that is a different subject. Because his money is my money lol ;)"
blackladies,3bf068,thanksforalllthefish,11,Mon Jun 29 03:29:25 2015 UTC,"You are allowed to set boundaries in your relationship and are entitled to feel negatively towards this incident.

blackladies,3bf068,AppleSpicer,9,Sun Jun 28 18:45:57 2015 UTC,"I think if it makes you that upset, it's worth a conversation."
blackladies,3bf068,AppleSpicer,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:08:06 2015 UTC,yea i'm definitely planning to talk to him about it when he gets back from his trip. i guess i needed time to process how i felt about it over the weekend too. but i just am wondering should i feel this upset about it. and if  going to a strip club while in relationships is as bad as i think...?
blackladies,3bf068,fatlittleparasite,3,Sun Jun 28 18:17:31 2015 UTC,I don't think I'm qualified to answer that. I have been to strip clubs with SO's in the past and didn't think anything of it. It didn't bother me. But it bothers some of my girlfriends. I guess it just comes down to the reasons he's going?
blackladies,3bf068,fatlittleparasite,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:01:34 2015 UTC,"yea, i mean i think it's ok if both people in the relationship go and are comfortable with it because it seems like a very sexual experience? but i've never been before so maybe that's why i dont get it.  i can't really see a reason for him to go with friends other than ""i would like to look at naked women who are not my girlfriend dance."" and i don't see how paying them to do it makes it any different...  if it's about having a good time, then i guess strip clubs are funner than normal bars/clubs, but that just leads me back to the why (aka titties and ass) which i'm having a hard time trying reconcile with. i guess im just jealous lol"
blackladies,3bf068,fatlittleparasite,5,Sun Jun 28 20:24:47 2015 UTC,"I definitely think this is one of those things you have to talk about. There are limits in every relationship and you have to make them clear to your partner. If he cares about you then he won't be apt to do something that you've told him makes you uncomfortable. It this specific case, it can be assumed that he didn't realize you would be so upset by it, so I would argue that it is forgivable. But now that he knows, get his assurance that he won't do it again."
blackladies,3bf068,fatlittleparasite,2,Sun Jun 28 18:18:19 2015 UTC,"i'm going to talk with him more about it for sure, and i definitely did not articulate my feelings about it as clearly to him because i dont think i really knew i felt this strongly about it until now.  and  it's not that i think it's unforgiveable. i just want to know if this type of thinking is irrational? or is it just totally up to people's own preference."
blackladies,3bf068,fatlittleparasite,5,Sun Jun 28 18:27:42 2015 UTC,"No, it's not irrational at all. If you don't like something, then you don't like it and I'm sure your boyfriend will respect that. I've never experienced this particular scenario but I'd probably be a bit upset as well haha."
blackladies,3bf068,faith_trustpixiedust,2,Sun Jun 28 18:50:47 2015 UTC,"You aren't controlling anyone by setting a relationship boundary. You determine what relationship you need and want, what boundaries help you meet those, and then it's up to him to decide if he wants to meet those or if they conflict with his boundaries such that he has to leave the relationship. Your boundaries aren't taking any of his freedom, it's his choice to meet them or not.   Also you don't compromise boundaries. Discuss and re evaluate, sure, but boundaries don't get moved to accommodate others. They are what you need in your relationship with another person.   You've already observed that different people need different boundaries. Of course women who don't establish boundaries or don't need many are considered ""cool"" and ""fun"" because men can do anything they want with them. This is sexism and pressured exploitation. It's totally bullshit so keep that in mind when you get insults for establishing boundaries. That's where they're coming from even if not consciously.   Best of luck. Boundaries are not fun but essential!!! The alternative is less fun as it sounds like you've experienced."
blackladies,3bf068,lovelyone20,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:33:27 2015 UTC,"thank you for the advice. we've talked and he knows clearly now what the boundaries are for me. I'm just having a tough time understanding why we as women are just supposed to by default not care, or why he thought it wasn't something he needed to tell me."
blackladies,3bf068,lovelyone20,2,Mon Jun 29 19:48:10 2015 UTC,"Because patriarchy? It's historically and modernly socially acceptable for men to consume women's bodies as entertainment. Even in something like a bachelor party which should be celebrating the upcoming marriage, not an excuse to blow a bunch of $$$ on a titty bar. Personally I hate how women are treated like items on a menu and expected to be cool with it. I have the utmost respect for sex workers and women who find a way to benefit from that climate but I wish that climate wasn't so sexist and normalized.   I'm glad you've talked and he now knows your boundaries!! Yay!"
blackladies,3bf068,faith_trustpixiedust,2,Mon Jun 29 20:26:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about the specific instance of him not telling you (though I think they don't tell us because they know it's shady), but I definitely feel the same way about strip clubs/hired strippers as a whole. I don't really see why it's something we are expected to be okay with. If someone is okay with their SO going to them then no problem, but it's bothered me for a while that we're just supposed to see it as tradition/what guys do. It's not expected that we should be okay with our SOs fucking other women, but some couples are into that and that's okay; it's just not expected as the norm the way strip clubs are. I realize there's a difference between looking and touching, but I also wouldn't lump the experience of going to a strip club just to look along with checking out another woman on the street.  I acknowledge that I'm a jealous person, but I don't think it's totally irrational to not be okay with your man purposely seeking out such a blatantly sexual encounter with someone else. Even just going without paying for a dance is still purposely putting oneself into a tempting situation, and it seems a lot more personal than porn, which I don't have a problem with. I've wanted to tell my boyfriend that I'm definitely not okay with him going to strip clubs just to be clear before shit actually happens, but as I saw you wrote in one of your comments, then it becomes a ""forbidden fruit"" and I would just assume he'd go anyway and hide it.  Plus I can't help but to think of it as literally spending money on other women. I suppose guys who go probably see it as spending money on themselves, but then to think of what he's buying for himself--sexual attention from another woman."
blackladies,3bf068,faith_trustpixiedust,2,Mon Jun 29 03:19:08 2015 UTC,"i also have a hard time with this. Apparently my SO thought i wouldn't have a problem with it at all and didn't think it was something he needed to disclose to me. i don't see how women are automatically expected to be ok with their men even visiting a place like this, let alone you don't think you have to tell your partner that you went to a strip club.   i think a close comparison for me would be like the difference between watching porn and paying for a cam girl. yea you are just watching in both cases, but the paying for a stranger to do sexual things for you to watch live seems a little bit worse."
blackladies,3bf068,faith_trustpixiedust,2,Mon Jun 29 19:46:27 2015 UTC,"That is a good comparison! I think people often forget that grey areas can exist when thinking about what we should and shouldn't be okay with. For me there's a gradient of how personal it is, I guess. Like I know my boyfriend will look at random nudes of girls on the internet, but when I found out he had found and uh... used a picture of someone we know, I was pretty upset. Same with the cam girl. Pre-recorded vs. live feels different to me. With live, even if you're not paying for it, you can request specific acts and there's actual interaction with the person."
blackladies,3bf068,faith_trustpixiedust,2,Mon Jun 29 21:42:19 2015 UTC,"yea, exactly. and i don't think strip clubs are that personal just seems like its a level up and tinkering with the boundaries.   also wtf on masterbating to someone's pic that you know?? thats just a little creepy"
blackladies,3bf068,lovelyone20,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:26:13 2015 UTC,"Coincidentally, the same day you replied with this comment, my boyfriend mentioned to me that a friend of his wants to take him to a strip club since he's never been. He wanted to see what I'd say about it.  Well, I was a little drunk when he brought it up and it was still fresh in my mind because of your post, so I guess I got a little too fired up about it and we got into an argument. I said a lot of what I said here about not knowing why it's just kind of expected that we be okay with it, and he kept trying to evade the reality that the only remarkable thing about strip clubs is naked women. He said that's not why he would go and that he doesn't care about ""seeing tits,"" and I just kept asking what other reason there is to go, and he just kept saying ""for the experience,"" ""a new atmosphere."" I kept pointing out that the ""experience"" and ""atmosphere"" are the naked women, but he just kept denying it and had no other way to articulate why he would want to go other than vague terms like that.  We eventually resolved it, but in the end I was still left feeling like the bitchy girlfriend even though I feel firm in what I think about the issue.  As for the pic of someone we know, he said he stumbled upon it and I believe him for the most part. Still, definitely didn't feel good to stumble upon myself."
blackladies,3bf068,faith_trustpixiedust,2,Sat Jul 4 04:24:10 2015 UTC,"Ooo sorry if this influenced you into getting in an argument with your bf anyway :/  but I'm glad you guys talked about it too.  but that's what I also keep getting from ppl ; vague responses. From both my SO and I talked with my older sister who says she doesn't care and  is super ok with it. They both have just said maybe I need to go to understand how it isn't like that. But I still don't see how they can't articulate the why it's ok when thinking about being committed it isn't naturally an issue, if they themselves go and know  how it is. I think it's because when you really strip it down (pun intended) lol the logic just doesn't add up"
blackladies,3bf068,lovelyone20,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:16:07 2015 UTC,"No problem! He brought it up first and I would have said the same things regardless of whether I saw your post or not.  I agree; thinking about it logically is where the problems come in, and I'm not sure if other people just aren't thinking through it or if we are just lacking experience. I still think it's a matter of personal comfort level. Reading other peoples' experiences with going only makes me less okay with it (vaginas in faces and whatnot)."

The girls never went out of their way to touch the men. Even the ones by themselves or with other guys, abd the girls are actually very lovely! I met one with a beautiful back tattoo and me a d her just talked about the tattoo abd how she's planning on moving to florida, all while she's shaking it for my boyfriend. Yeah, he was looking, but he wasn't getting turned on by her. He wasn't trying to fuck her. If anything, that made him want to bone me even more. It was actually a very fun experience, when you get over some insecurities. 10/10 would go again."

It depends the strip club tbh and the man. Since you were there of-course some of them will turn it down a notch. Men do have sex with some strippers and get head. Not all but it still happens and some even eat out the strippers but that doesn't happen to often.   A strip club is meant to be sexual, if it wasn't men wouldn't go to it."

We didn't even have sex. I said ""if anything"". We were on our way to Florida, so we just kept driving after the place closed. No sex afterwards. No sexual conversation either. We were more impressed at the building abd the clean area it was in than the naked women inside. Like another redditor said, it's only as sexual as you want it to be. I am not attracted to females, nor was I expecting an overly sexual experience. Therefore, I didn't get one."
blackladies,3bf068,fatlittleparasite,2,Tue Jun 30 17:52:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry for misinterpreting.    like another redditor said, it's only as sexual as you want it to be.    i get that, but how by default is a strip club not a 'sexy' place for lack of a better word?"
blackladies,3bf068,fatlittleparasite,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:47:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think this stems more from an insecure place. It is a sexual place, but that sexual level can either be 3, or 100 depending on what you want it to be. I'm not saying it's not a sexual place. I'm just saying that it's not like there's just in the air abd people fucking on stage (all the time). Also, people are able to control themselves around stimulus. I think if it the sane way I think of porn. I watch it myself. The guy isn't what turns me on, it's the fact that a sexual act is being performed. I'm turned on by a penis entering a vagina, not by the man attatched to it necessarily. It's the sane way for my bf. It wasn't so much the girl dancing abd being naked that turns him on, so it Didnt turn him on.   Just because your bf goes to strip clubs, doesn't mean he doesnt find you attractive or enjoys you sexually or anything. I do think it was strange that he withheld the fact that he went from you, but I think that your discomfort with the idea of him going to a strip club stems from a place other thanbjust not being comfortable.  Btw, did you guys have that talk yet? How did it go?"
blackladies,3bf068,leftblane,2,Tue Jun 30 19:24:48 2015 UTC,"i mean i get it's not personal at all but what you said to me sounds so similar to rationals when partners do actually cheat and have sex with other people and ""it didnt mean anything it was just physical. sure you can get over it, but it's still a problem for most. (not saying strip clubs are on this level at all)  and again i admit im insecure too. i know he finds me attractive etc and the stripper doesn't change that. i know he's coming home to me. i think i'm just jealous, i don't like the idea of him looking at other naked women in person. who would?   and we did talk, he knows how i feel about it, that i don't like him going at all, but i understand for certain situations.  it was a little rough, he got very defensive which bothered me too.   i still need time to get over the whole thing."
blackladies,3bf068,faith_trustpixiedust,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:57:27 2015 UTC,"I think he also felt either attacked, or knew something was sketchy about him going.  That rational is not what I'm trying to convey at all. Imm actually really glad we as internet strangers are able to have this conversation without things getting hairy. I'm sorry if I made you feel some kind of way about it. You're perfectly within your rights to not be comfortable with him going. Now that he knows how you feel about it, hopefully it won't be a problem again."
blackladies,3bf068,leftblane,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:28:31 2015 UTC,no it's ok! really i do appreciate your perspective. i am just trying to wrap my mind around things lol. and you are helping. haha thank you :)
blackladies,3bf068,faith_trustpixiedust,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:10:14 2015 UTC,"So my presence restricted the other strippers from being as sexual with the other men than they would normally be, even though I did not come eith those other men?"

It could just be a classier place where people wouldnt willingly risk sexually transmitted diseases by engaging in unprotected sex acts... I'm not saying it doesn't happen but that's just disgusting abd I really couldn't imagine places allowing that, let alone people allowing/engaging in that themselves."

blackladies,3bf068,leftblane,2,Wed Jul 1 05:14:55 2015 UTC,Glad I could make you laugh lml. I'm a pre-med student and std's freak me out in general. I'm a huge germaphobe so this is seriously throwing me for a loop. My bf is Jamaican and he says he's seen live sex in strip clubs before.. but... omg I could never! The herpes is real and I don't fucks with it.
blackladies,3bf068,leftblane,2,Wed Jul 1 05:33:52 2015 UTC,"I guess I just can't separate looking and getting turned on. Like, what is the point for him to look if not to get turned on? I also just don't feel right about not being the one to turn my boyfriend on before he bones me. I would just feel cheapened I guess? Like I'm not good enough so he's got to look at other women and then just use my body. Even if it's not a matter of not being good enough, I guess it's just that I wouldn't like thinking while he's boning me that he's only so aroused because of someone else. I've heard other women say they like that about going too and that's awesome for them, but I don't think that's the kind of thing I'd be into. Definitely not being right there while another woman is all up on him; I'd probably just want to cry.  I just don't see how a place where the main draw is a sexual environment (because if it were booze and music you could just go to a regular club/bar) can not be sexual. Still, thank you for telling me about your experience. It's getting my brain working on it more. I just hate feeling like I need to make myself be okay with this so I can be a good/cool girlfriend."
blackladies,3be8lm,politicaleft,28,Sun Jun 28 11:59:44 2015 UTC,"Black culture is popular, black people are not.    ""Everyone wants to be a nigga, nobody wants to be a nigger."" Black male and female features are also both desired and undesired by society.  It's an interesting psychoanalysis of racism and white supremacy that it can simultaneously detest blackness and imitate it (or even ape it in racist subs like coontown)."

I don't even know whether to just laugh at how absurd life is right now or...  Note:* Yeah I know this is a Japanese designer. I just meant in general.
blackladies,3be8lm,eroverton,7,Sun Jun 28 13:27:27 2015 UTC,This looks absolutely ridiculous. I would be embarrassed to send that down the runway.
blackladies,3be8lm,dratthecookies,9,Sun Jun 28 19:08:11 2015 UTC,If you think cultural ignorance is bad in America you should see what flies in Japan.
blackladies,3be8lm,ThatAgnosticGuy,8,Sun Jun 28 15:58:46 2015 UTC,America has way less of an excuse though.
blackladies,3be8lm,lottikey,18,Sun Jun 28 17:48:06 2015 UTC,"Japan doesn't have an excuse either. If you were to wear costumes similar to the Japanese caricatures we have here, they would get offended. They know exactly what they are doing, but hide behind ignorance."
blackladies,3be8lm,_Liquorice_,2,Sun Jun 28 18:51:22 2015 UTC,"I didn't say they didn't have an excuse.  I already know that, US is multiracial while Japan is the near opposite so that's why I said what I said."
blackladies,3be8lm,lottikey,0,Sun Jun 28 22:17:47 2015 UTC,"I dunno...they're like the White people of Asia when it comes to appropriation, they've just finally made it around to Black people."
blackladies,3be8lm,RhombusBlue,3,Mon Jun 29 01:05:43 2015 UTC,"No and no.  This isn't anything new from them and believe me, Japan isn't the only Asian country that does this.  I've seen much worse.  Look at my other reply."
blackladies,3be8lm,lottikey,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:41:41 2015 UTC,"Not getting where you're going...I didn't say they were the only one (I'm really, really aware of that...anti-Blackness is a norm in Asia) or that it was new. (Edit for clarity: In the history of Japanese cultural appropriation, the appropriation of Blackness is new compared to their centuries of appropriation of their neighbors' cultures/fashion/language/religions/etc.)   My issue is saying that Japan has more of an excuse. I can't see any way they do when you look at their history with other cultures and appropriation...China most specifically. I can just imagine someone seeing the latest instance of yellow-face in the U.S. and saying that Japan has less of an excuse...they really don't. Both countries are founded off appropriation and racial/ethnic abuse.  Like...I'm not cool with minimizing the appropriative and exploitative nature of any culture/country just because they might be new to a certain set of targets. I'm really against framing racism, and cultural appropriation in general, as something America is exceptionally advanced at. Fools all over the world are doing this and benefitting from it.   Edit: That said, I do think there is a difference in that in some parts of America, appropriation gets called out. Both countries are coming from similar places though. Also, Blackness does always end up at the bottom of the appropriation ladder, so there is that factor."
blackladies,3be8lm,RhombusBlue,0,Mon Jun 29 13:57:35 2015 UTC,"they're like the White people of Asia when it comes to appropriation   No.  They don't need to be given this analogy since they've been doing this on their own for a while now, of course American media has made it worse, but like you've already pointed out they already have history with cultural appropriating other countries and people as well.  A comparison like that can be considered offensive too.   they've just finally made it around to Black people.   No.  There's no finally because this is not new like this part suggests.  If you meant relatively new compared to the others...like OK, but that doesn't really change anything.  It's still been going on for decades, I wouldn't call that new, but  yes, it's new-ish if you need to compare it to hundreds of years for the others.  You're making a lot of assumptions.  Do I even seem like the person who thinks there's no problem with this or would brush it off even a little?  My point is that America has had black people on their soil since before it became a nation and it's still doing this nonsense while Japan is still like 95%+ Japanese even after all these years.  I'm not excusing either.  US has WAY less of an excuse than Japan and there's no way to logically argue against that."

A comparison like that can be considered offensive too.   Considering we were both responding to a comment comparing Japan and the U.S., comparing the two very much puts their behavior in an important and relevant context. I can maybe see the offense, but not in a way that's not rooted in a pot bristling because it's being called black.    If you meant relatively new compared to the others...like OK   I meant new compared to others. In relation to literally thousands of years of appropriation, decades is new for them in terms of targeting, which is why I said ""finally"". Appropriators just work their way around different cultures as they encounter them.    You're making a lot of assumptions. Do I even seem like the person who thinks there's no problem with this or would brush it off even a little? My point is that America has had black people on their soil since before it became a nation and it's still doing this nonsense while Japan is still like 95%+ Japanese even after all these years.    Didn't assume that you personally were ok with it at all (I've read too many of your posts to think that), but I do take issue with the framing of discussions like this around the target (Blackness in this case)...and that's because I have a problem discussing appropriation as something people learn as wrong because of the target itself as opposed to discussing it as a behavior that's rooted in the appropriator itself.   Basically appropriators gonna appropriate--that's why Japan will jump right on the appropriation bandwagon...not because they're just now learning to appropriate Blackness, but because they are cultural appropriators and it doesn't matter who they come across. They just happened to run across the Chinese/Koreans(?)/etc. first.     I'm not excusing either. US has WAY less of an excuse than Japan and there's no way to logically argue against that.   Same. I don't see either as having an excuse. The only reason Japan is only recently starting to appropriate Blackness is sheer physical proximity (or lack thereof). I'm not willing to differentiate between abusers who just haven't had the time to get around to certain victims yet.   Overall, I think it's important to look at instances like these and not blame American media for Japanese behavior. Of course they take some queues from it, but it's not like American/Western stereotyping encouraged them in their appropriation. It just exposed them to a new set of targets."
blackladies,3be8lm,RhombusBlue,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:36:45 2015 UTC,"As a side note, Japan is so ethnically homogeneous because of a few factors...Their indigenous people died out (largely through diseases, partially through deliberate action), They overtly fight to keep the country ""pure"" (America's general values of diversity create a different, though still-appropriative environment), and they're an island nation.   They've created an environment that lets them appropriate but still appear as if they have an excuse for ignorance. They fight hard to maintain that in their children...Americans do too (especially now), but honestly, the Japanese just laid a better framework for establishing Japanese supremacy and had geography on their side (their forced labor largely took place outside of their continent)."
blackladies,3bdj06,IrbyTremor,49,Sun Jun 28 04:56:46 2015 UTC,"Most predictable response ever. It's because they swear they're being oppressed and have to stand up for their rights! But really it's ""How dare anybody not-white dictate what white people can and can't do? Only WE get to decide what other people can and can't do!"" ... Syndrome.  Look what happened when they finally banned r/n----s. They kept popping up again like a hydra and gained way more subscribers in the process because other white people got indignant over their struggle against oppression. lol  Imagine this: There are lots of children on a playground. Everybody has a ball. They're bouncing them, playing catch, chasing them, swapping them, and so forth. Except little Kyle. Little Kyle's favorite thing to do with his ball is to hurl it at the heads of the other children. After a while, the parents start making a fuss about Kyle continuing to be allowed to do this. So the teacher comes over and says, ""Kyle if you don't stop hurting people with your ball, you won't be allowed to play anymore."" Kyle says ""You can't tell me what to do!"" like the precious angel that he is. He continues doing what he wants. So the teacher takes his ball away. Kyle looks around and sees everyone is allowed to keep their ball but his has been taken away, so he flips out. ""WHY ARE YOU PICKING ON ME!? GIVE ME BACK MY BALL! THEY GET TO KEEP THEIR BALL! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME! THAT'S NOT FAAAAAAIIR!"" And because Kyle has never been taught to be rational, fair, and play nicely with others, Kyle only sees that he's been told he can't do something he wanted to do. Kyle is enraged. Kyle is also a sociopath, so he starts looking for sharp rocks to hurl at the children instead.  It's not a perfect metaphor, really. A more apt one would have the teacher quietly encouraging Kyle's behavior because he's her son, and only taking the ball away to try to pacify the other parents into believing that she's doing something substantive about his behavior - meanwhile she's going back in the classroom to alter their grades to put Kyle at the head of the class and think up new ways to teach all the students to believe that Kyle is inherently better than them in every way."

blackladies,3bc6nd,mangaloree,20,Sat Jun 27 22:04:39 2015 UTC,"No, you see it is actually about Southern pride. According to reddit, poor white farmers did so much back-breaking work (unlike those black slaves) so they are just celebrating their heritage of hardwork. I wish I could make this up. Like out of all the symbols they could have chosen to represent their heritage it was the one made to defend slavery."
blackladies,3bc6nd,askfella,28,Sat Jun 27 23:40:26 2015 UTC,The difference between the U.S. south and nazi Germany is that Germany at least had the sense to be embarrassed.
blackladies,3bc6nd,RhinelandBasterd,21,Sun Jun 28 00:33:53 2015 UTC,"The thing is Germany was forced by the international community to be embarrassed, financially and morally.  The US has never had to pay for the wrongs that it wrought against Africans and Americans blacks.  Hell, this country didn't do a simply apology for slavery until 2009, until the country got its first black President.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/18/AR2009061803877.html"

Then they also complain about white guilt and say people who have a problem with the flag are the real bigots.  Unfortunately it's not a distraction because most people don't even know what the TPP was even before the flag became an issue and the vast majority wouldn't know even if the flag wasn't in the media.  Hell, i'm trying to follow it and I don't know for certain that it is a bad thing."

Like that policy many people believe it to have negative consequences for middle, working and lower class Americans.  One of the many issues is that it being done in secret. The senate recently passed it on the 24.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership  ""The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a proposed regional regulatory and investment treaty. As of 2014, twelve countries throughout the Asia Pacific region have participated in negotiations on the TPP: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States, and Vietnam. The proposed agreement began in 2005 as the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement (TPSEP or P4). Participating countries set the goal of wrapping up negotiations in 2012, but contentious issues such as agriculture, intellectual property, and services and investments have caused negotiations to continue into the present,[7] with the last round meeting in Ottawa from 3–12 July 2014.[8][9] Implementation of the TPP is one of the primary goals of the trade agenda of the Obama administration in the United States of America. On 12 November 2011, the nine Trans-Pacific Partnership countries announced that the TPP is intended to ""enhance trade and investment among the TPP partner countries, to promote innovation, economic growth and development, and to support the creation and retention of jobs.""[10] Although the text of the treaty has not been made public, Wikileaks has published several leaked documents since 2013. A number of global health professionals, internet freedom activists, environmentalists, organised labour, advocacy groups, and elected officials have criticised and protested against the treaty, in large part because of the secrecy of negotiations, the agreement's expansive scope, and controversial clauses in drafts leaked to the public."""

I've worked in abusive, hostile environments like this and long-term exposure to this abuse has the same psychological impacts of battered spouse syndrome, PTSD, etc. Trying to protective yourself by going through the correct process like HR could only make the abuse worse. You have to be very vigilant about documenting these occurrences. I would even recommend  to go outside the company for assistant because HR will do everything they can to make it or you disappear."
blackladies,3bbsg3,cardboardsoles,8,Sat Jun 27 20:12:23 2015 UTC,"I think HR would make me disappear.

In a way our culture as African's is a liability in this situation since all we wanna do is work and not cause any trouble but at what price?. You did good though, talk to someone at the ACLU and they might be able to help those women."
blackladies,3bbsg3,faith_trustpixiedust,5,Sat Jun 27 19:09:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know about recording things, because the company may feel some kind of way about you having recording devices out. Talk to the African women, then management. Really emphasize how uncomfortable that woman makes you feel. If they fire you, then good. You dont want to work for a company that condones behavior like that anyway."
blackladies,3bbsg3,RhombusBlue,6,Sat Jun 27 22:25:43 2015 UTC,"Talk to the other ladies and get some perspective on what's going on. Awful White lady is surely awful, but you never know what the rest of the dynamic is like.   As far as the company is concerned, save yourself some emotional effort and just accept that at some level, even if it's just keeping themselves ignorant of it, they're ok with her behavior.   ...and just...start kicking around an exit plan once you're in a place to use one.  Your brother needs to chill, because even accepting that situation for what it is takes a form of bravery (many, many people on the inside ignore these kinds of things). I get where he's coming from, but principles can cost you your job, health, and more, so it's a big decision you have to make."

These past few weeks and months have been an important reminder that discrimination in many forms is alive and well in America. It reminds us of the deeply unfortunate reality that progress for some is not progress for all and there can be equally significant steps backward as there are forward. If we are truly dedicated to our democracy and the values that we as a nation cherish, we must be equally committed to ensuring that all citizens are treated equally, that all Americans deserve justice. That's when we're all united.   It's quite true too that a lot of social progress by other groups is often simultaneously built on both black progress and anti-blackness. We can look no further than Asian groups in America and the gay community itself who later became complicit or pivotal in upholding white supremacy after Civil Rights."
blackladies,3bbkr2,askfella,13,Sat Jun 27 18:35:12 2015 UTC,"The LGBTQ movement has been likened to the black civil rights movement of our past, with ""gay"" even being called the ""new black"" (""black,"" in this summation, serving as a synonym for ""lack"" — a lack of access and rights).    Has always bothered me as a queer black lady...as if racism is just a thing of the past that was replaced by something more current.  There cannot be a new anything if the old is still alive and active in society."

Seeing all those ""allies"" on facebook posting their rainbow profile pictures, while trans people are still seen as freaks by the very same people who call themselves allies. There have been way too many trans suicides this year. And with black trans ladies especially, there has been way too much senseless murder. Every year on trans day of remembrance, the vast majority of murdered trans people are black women. Where are the cute profile overlays for that?"

In this case, how you do set a fire expecting to cause fear? It's a fire. Shit burns, we all know that.

blackladies,3b93bm,_Liquorice_,10,Sat Jun 27 00:49:49 2015 UTC,"sorry, i didn't mean that directly at you (as i see you have a u.s flag by your name).   the usa has a long history (and ongoing present) of wars of aggression, and brutal bloody covert operations, mostly in nations with majority people of color, and although racism isn't the motivation for this (it's profit and power), racism helps to enable it (same was the case for slavery). the flag and patriotism gets tangled up with this racism.   under the flag of the usa, there was slavery of blacks and there was genocide of natives.   the usa flag is used as a rallying symbol against immigration, particularly from mexico and latin-america.   of course the usa flag, being a symbol, can have different meanings in different contexts and to different people. but it isn't free of racist baggage, either."

blackladies,3b93bm,AliceHouse,5,Sat Jun 27 01:27:27 2015 UTC,"I just don't understand why it is always a problem for Black Americans to recognize their nationality.   I think it's because, in reality,  we are mostly still only Americans by geography (jus soli) rather than nationality. Because there's no amount of patriotism we show (have shown) that makes us 'fully' American. Recognizing one's nationality is tantamount to your nation recognizing your rights as a full or, at least, equal citizen before the law, before your race. Yet there will always be those seeking birth certificates, there will always be allegations of being another religion (even though there has always been a ""separation of church and state"")...  Every cop shooting an unarmed black person or kneeling on a black girl's back makes us less American.  Those  aren't just coincidences of the Black American reality, they really mean we are not (and have never been) American enough, that is white. ""To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be in a rage almost all the time,"" and such a state is un-American  according to Baldwin."
blackladies,3b93bm,askfella,7,Sat Jun 27 04:10:59 2015 UTC,"I understand, but I don't let racist trash dictate rights to my country, especially when half of them arrived here at the turn of the last century. I'm also descendants of the very people who built this country and gave it some character. I am American and don't fit in anywhere else in the world.  I think more Black people should recognize this and stop acting like things have to be like this. People before us fought for basic human rights and made great strides. They clearly didn't accept things as they were"
blackladies,3b93bm,psychgirl88,5,Sat Jun 27 04:39:20 2015 UTC,"Y'know... you do bring up an excellent point. I'm usually on that Dead Prez ""Osama wasn't aiming at us"" jammer, but our ancestors did quite literally build this country. We should be entitled to claiming it."
blackladies,3b93bm,Altered_Piece,3,Sat Jun 27 09:24:20 2015 UTC,"I understand, but I don't let racist trash dictate rights to my country... I am American and don't fit in anywhere else in the world.   I'm just saying what is not what we should feel, because racist trash do dictate our rights in this country. You can be proud of being a Black American (yes, we built this country and created most of its culture) without being proud of America. I remember when Michelle Obama mentioned she had never been proud of America in her entire life until that moment, and white people threw their usual tantrum. I'm more proud of Black American history than the history of White supremacy, and we shouldn't sacrifice our blackness just to call ourselves American.   I think more Black people should recognize this and stop acting like things have to be like this.   We've made great strides, there was no point where we said ""things have to be like this"" (we keep introducing change to America) but, the reality is we aren't there yet. I think that is how most Black Americans feel, hence why we need separate flags, holidays, etc.  Trying to be 'American' beyond legal rights just screams erasure of Black history and assimilation. We are more than just Americans in a country that sees us as lesser than."

Happy to see that love has finally won :)  Some of the responses from people against the decision have been hilarious and frightening.  Mike Huckabee's is...something else:  ""For a lot of believers, the question comes, do we have civil disobedience, or do we have Biblical disobedience? For many of us, civil disobedience—when we believe that the civil government has acted outside of nature, and nature's god, outside of the bounds of the law, outside of the bounds of the Constitution—we believe that it's the right and the moral thing to do. Now I understand that's a very controversial thing to say. But Todd, what if no one had acted in disobedience to the Dred Scott decision of 1857? What if the entire country had capitulated to judicial tyranny and we just said that because the Supreme Court said in 1857 said that a black person wasn’t fully human—suppose we had accepted that, suppose Abraham Lincoln, our president, had accepted that, would that have been the right course of action? And I don't know of anyone, I mean seriously, I don't know of anyone who believes that the Supreme Court made the right decision in Dred Scott.""  Yep, those are totally the same thing.

blackladies,3b8iia,2LifeA,10,Fri Jun 26 20:48:37 2015 UTC,I have a little two year old cousin who's already very into Disney princesses and I'm seriously concerned about how the images she sees are shaping her own self perception. I definitely had issues with this growing up and I would love to spare her that sort of confusion. I try to push more racially diverse media when I'm with her (though the options are extremely limited) but so far she's only interested in Anna and Cinderella. :(
blackladies,3b8iia,thanksforalllthefish,6,Sat Jun 27 08:41:50 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie, 'round these parts we have the Black versions of Cinderella and Annie (though as far as Babygirl is concerned they're THE Cinderella and Annie), and though I can't make a Black Elsa, I sure as heck have Flora, Ignis, and Adhira as my computer screensavers to combat Babygirl's Elsa obsession because she watches it nonstop at home (it's my niece). And I personally adopt an attitude of ""oh those are okay"" with the white versions but rave over the beauty of the others, because that's the only possible tool I have when she's in my care to combat the constant white beauty standard she gets from everyone else. Like, when she points out Elsa, I give it the ""oh, that's nice"" shrug treatment, but when Ignis and Flora are on screen I'm all ""Whoa how beautiful!"" Unfortunately they don't have a movie so she can still see that the white one has more value, but I am buying the hell out of Home when it comes out.  Honestly, even the representative things have their issues for me. Home is mostly about the Alien. Black Annie has them shoehorning in a white woman that the Black billionaire falls for with seemingly not much more impetus other than the fact that she's there. Doc McStuffins doesn't have Black dolls. Multicultural Cinderella was mostly cool, and I have fewer things that bug me though Black Queen + White King = Asian Prince makes you kinda go ""wha?""  We have to be on guard for these things, we think the child doesn't notice, but the child DOES notice and it DOES subconciously affect them and tell them this is NOT their world, it's a white world and they only belong in the margins of it."
blackladies,3b8iia,eroverton,3,Sat Jun 27 10:57:06 2015 UTC,"Haha! I'm definitely going to adopt some of these strategies! I'm constantly trying to talk my aunt (the little one's mom) into making more of an effort in terms of diversifying the images my little cousin sees, but she doesn't take it seriously at all. You should have seen the look on my face when I saw my cousin's cake for her 2nd Birthday. It was a white, blonde, barbie princess in a pink dress. I was so distraught.   But I'll have you know that I showed her the pictures of Flora, Ignis and Adhira earlier today and her face absolutely lit up, especially over Ignis, so thank you for that!"

There are more, if you google 'racebent elsa' or something, you can find sources that made lots of versions - Asian, Latino, even an Inuit one I think.  And I feel your pain on the cake thing! Every time my niece shows up with blonde white girls all over her clothes and shoes and toys I want to punch someone in the face.  Another thing I do - make a photo album of beautiful Black women - cartoon or real, or both, play them on a slideshow screensaver whenever possible. Go through the pictures exclaiming over how beautiful they are - and here's the important part -  link it to her beauty. For instance, I will say ""Oh wow, she's so beautiful because she has wonderful curly hair just like yours! Ooooh look at the princess! Wow, she has beautiful brown skin just like mine! And a beautiful smile just like you! (Any picture of a Black woman dressed fancy, I refer to as a princess or a queen - I particularly like to use Nigerian wedding photos because the headdresses and the jewelry always looks regal - but not Euro-regal - so it's easy to sell as queens/princesses). White Disney characters (well except Elsa/Anna since they ARE a queen and princess) I might correct. Ariel - that's not a PRINCESS, silly! That's a mermaid! Cue photo of a ""real"" princess. (technically Ariel is one but I'm fairly sure even though she's seen the character, she's too young to have watched the movie so I'm okay fudging that one).   MY mom used to go ""ew I don't want that ugly white doll"" whenever she saw one (lol). But that was because we didn't have as many other resources (books, dolls, TV shows, movies) when I was little to counterbalance the whiteness bombardment, so she went hard on it for us mentally. I don't go that far, but the white dolls and characters get the shrug-not-that-impressed treatment from me and the Black ones get enthusiasm.  I realize some might think that's going too far and teaching her racial preference, but my feeling is if the ENTIRE WORLD is hell bent on telling her that white is best and others matter less, then I'm comfortable leaning a little bit strongly in the other direction to try to force some balance in her mind. My hope is that the end result will be ""I really love myself and my skin and hair and it's fantastic and other people that look like me are fantastic and beautiful too... and hey, other people are cool as well, they have some nice stuff going on for them."" Know what I mean? I'm trying to instill enough self love that when she sees positive images of other people, she can appreciate them for what they are without feeling like she's less because she ISN'T that. They're cool for what they are, but she's cool for what she is."

How pathetic do you have to be to make a three year old feel like less than??  That said, it's interesting that this made international news.   ""I asked the woman what she meant by the comment and then one of the woman's young daughters screwed up her face, she pointed at Samara and said, 'You're black and black is ugly.' ""   If I could punch this woman in the face repeatedly, it wouldn't come close to the damage this child's sense of self took.  Also, the biggest of jaded sighs for this non-helpful bullshit.   Meghan Hope, 20, who works at Disney World in Orlando, Florida, was so outraged on witnessing the shocking incident that she arranged for Queen Elsa herself to send Samara a personal message encouraging her to ""always be yourself"".  In the touching video, Queen Elsa says: ""Hello Samara, it's Elsa, queen of Arandelle. I've heard a little bit about you so I just want to say hi ... I just want to remind you to always be yourself and let it go.""   This is why representation matters and not just the tokenized stuff media tends to offer.   I can't see how white Elsa telling  this child to always be herself when she'd been told that herself is ugly is helping her.  An Aboriginal princess movie and products however WOULD help."

One point I heard and like was that if it really was about Southern Pride for people, why would they choose only the symbol of a war that only ran for four years and specifically built to exclude me? And try to not call yourself racist? The only purpose of the flag is to exclude and demean us, what pride is there in that?? Why do they choose not to see that theyve been taught to see racism as normal and that theyre probably doing it in so many other ways in their life. bah.

Like Clarence Thomas (bless his heart) once quipped: ""'A burning torch and a burning cross -- what's the difference? One hundred years of history.'' (Upon this point,  as Justice Holmes reasoned, a ""page of history is worth a volume of logic"").   The only thing Reddit admins, the perfect pseudo-libertarians that they are, can 'logically' relate the burning expressions of racism on their site with is harassment (which was what they invoked to ban fatpeoplehate). That is despite a lot of the anti-black ""hate speech"" here being significantly worse than harassment or intimidation.

blackladies,3b5zhi,FixinThePlanet,22,Fri Jun 26 23:10:20 2015 UTC,"It's this kind of dynamic that really indicates the shortcomings of the approach ""the cure to hate speech is more speech."" This idea --that speech is a free market in which the best ideas inevitably rise to the top-- seems to unite Americans more than any other, regardless of political identity or level of extremism. It's an idea that is rarely critically analyzed, and is usually just accepted on faith and the imagination of how horrible it would be to have one's own speech repressed.  It is true that* freedom of speech in the US exceeds that of most other countries. HOWEVER, this is because almost all other constitutional democracies --many whose constitutions were informed by the horrors of WW2 on their own soil-- recognize a fundamental, constitutional right that is valued even higher than free speech. This is the right to dignity. Nations that suffered through the Holocaust recognized that unbridled freedom of speech permitting ideologies of hate can and did drive humans to some of the worst horrors that could committed on other humans.  The right to dignity is the first right described in the preamble to the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. It appears in the constitutions of almost every other constitutional democracy, more prominently then free speech.  It's the right to dignity that allows countries to ban Nazi parades, flags, hate group public meetings, to prevent prominent hate group members from entering their countries. The right to dignity informs the ""right to forget,"" which allows convicts who have served their debt to society to have detailed, named information of their past crimes suppressed. As fundamental rights do, it can conflict with others -- preventing speech in the name of dignity. And it can be abused, obviously: shutting down speech of political, religious, or economic opponents can and has been used to consolidate and keep power.  Point is that no US citizen has this right recognized elsewhere as fundamental. US citizens do not have a constitutional right to dignity. And because of this scheme, we get the lovely freedoms of having Nazi parades through Jewish neighborhoods. Of having open, public, KKK rallies. Free speech gives us the 'right' to have decades-old petty crimes haunt us for the rest of our lives, limiting our career options, preventing reformed criminals from becoming the most productive members of society that they can be. It gives us the right to lie, to hate, to encourage others to hate, to manipulate, ostracize, divide and conquer out of a pure lust for brutality, dominance, and control.  The lack of a US right to dignity, and the elevation of the right to free speech above all else, means we 'get' to have hate forums dedicated to the vilest, basest forms of behavior rising in prominence through public forums that would be prohibited elsewhere, as they clearly violate the human right to dignity."

I have to admit that I'm a pretty privileged person- I'm white and identify as male, and though I'm trans and gay, I'm clocked as a cis, straight man like 95% of the time. Sometimes stuff like freedom of speech is something I think ""well, of course"" when it's a topic of discussion, but you've reminded me that it's because I have a level of privilege that helps me maintain that perspective. It's very easy for me to be that way when I'm not continually forced to confront/see/read/hear people using ""freedom of speech"" as a tool for oppression and the consequences of that.   I'm actually sort of embarrassed. I work with LGBT youth, many of whom are black/Latino. I should know better than to dismissively accept freedom of speech as some undeniable positive.

The predominant narrative in entertainment is that they are the heroes, the rescuers, the rebels who rise up against wrongdoers.  That is the propaganda with very few exceptions.  Many know deep down that this is not the case, but they work very hard to ignore it.  The reaction that white girl and so many white people have lines up with having a delusion shattered.  Angry denial and blame the messenger, which we all are since we are black people.  Our existence in non-black spaces and how we got there is evidence of that."

I recently bought A Brief History of Neoliberalism and The Life and Death of the Great American School System. Ravitch's book is on the school ""reform"" movement, i.e., charter schools. Charter schools are quickly becoming neoliberals' panacea to fixing school systems instead of focusing on the big picture- alleviating poverty and institutional racism. It is a way of    using ideologies to ""fix"" schools  taking away control from teachers and school boards and giving it to billionaire plutocrats (Gates, Walmart family, hedge funds & private equity, Reed Hastings) and their minions weakening teachers' unions (destroying unions has been part of the mantra of neoliberalism) funneling tax payer money from public schools to the plutocrats I just mentioned.

Public schools aren't necessarily substantially better than charters (I do agree that there are some pretty good charter schools). But charters usually exclude ppl with disabilities and ESL learners, and they also tend to receive students who are dedicated enough to switch schools, but even with that, 83% of charter schools are worse than public schools. And if you keep taking away money from public school, they are just gonna keep getting worse which will then lead to more charter schools, and the cycle will keep repeating. None of this is focusing on the bigger issue, which is alleviating poverty and segregation, and many other systematic factors."

I believe she's one of the leading education historians these days. I occasionally read editorials about charter schools on the WSJ, LAT, and other outlets, and it's quite embarrassing that they don't refer to her knowledge despite the fact that she is very knowledgable in that area. They just spout free-market dogma to advocate for charter schools.    They tend to have these zero tolerance policies that criminalize the normal behaviors of their largely minority students.   Atlantic had an article that talked about this; New Orleans schools, in particular. It's very similar to the broken-windows theory, where if you come down on small mishaps, then the more serious ""crimes"" will stop and then students will do better academically. I would imagine this  strongly reinforces the school to prison pipeline, since even children inside their schools are seen as criminals."

It's a fictional account of the life of Empress Wu, the only woman to ever sit on the Dragon Throne of China as 'Emperor' (Empress Regnant, not Empress Consort or Empress Dowager).  I like it because it gives her story a lot of humanity and puts her in a kind light, whereas many accounts vilify her (largely, I suspect, due to Confucian ideals of the time which considered a female in authority as unnatural and dangerous, so they accused her of witchcraft and murder and all kinds of nonsense). Despite her reign being very successful and prosperous, historical accounts slander her person terribly - I assume to make her a negative example so no other women got the ambition to rule China in her own right.  I have a soft spot for stories about strong women who history tried to pretend didn't exist (like Hatshepsut), or made to seem crazed, cruel, or unnatural. I had, in fact, just finished re-reading another old favorite - The Firebrand by Marion Zimmer Bradley, which tells the story of Cassandra of Troy, who predicted Troy's fall to the Greeks and who everyone considered to be a madwoman at the time.  That one, however, comes across a little heavy-handed on the WOMYN POWER message now that I read it again years later. I mean, I get the message, and that was an important theme of the story but it seemed every plot point revolved around ""as womyn, we r so oppressed omg why should men control us why does an unmarried woman scare everyone, if women were in charge this war wouldn't even be happening, this whole mess is because of penis worship"". So. It's still a great book and an interesting perspective on the story of Troy but still. Okay, we get it."

blackladies,3b330w,DissentingInClear,19,Thu Jun 25 15:58:41 2015 UTC,"The most shocking piece for me:   In a classic study on race, psychologists staged an experiment with two photographs that produced a surprising result.  They showed people a photograph of two white men fighting, one unarmed and another holding a knife. Then they showed another photograph, this one of a white man with a knife fighting an unarmed African-American man.  When they asked people to identify the man who was armed in the first picture, most people picked the right one. Yet when they were asked the same question about the second photo, most people -- black and white -- incorrectly said the black man had the knife."
blackladies,3b330w,dripdroponmytiptop,24,Thu Jun 25 15:59:28 2015 UTC,"oh man I just watched the Through the Wormhole documentary ep(s06e01 if you want to watch it) about the psychology of bigotry and it was extremely fascinating  a similar study had black and white people look at random locations outdoors and indoors, with a black or white man standing/crouching/etc randomly positioned in the photo. In their hand was either a gun, or a cellphone, and it flashed for barely a second and you had to choose either to ""shoot"" them with your gun or not- if you did and they had a gun, you survive. If they had a cellphone, you've just killed an innocent. If you don't shoot, you're killed or... nothing happens.  The results were exactly the same for black and white people- they would very rarely make errors towards killing people, but when they did, predictably it was black men who got shot regardless if they had a phone or a gun. They did the same test on cops, and the mistakes actually went down, which suggests the resurgence of police violence is purposeful and/or lucid in nature, opposing their training.  an adjacent study showed that for white people, being in a social group or solving puzzles and/or working together with a black person for even half an hour broke down the inherent bias that they had in terms of identifying the faces of black people as angry or threatening, and when their brains were monitored they showed higher empathy and concern and stress seeing photos of black people mistreated or hurt or sad, versus the control group, suggesting that even just a little bit of exposure to people outside their race is enough to help make biases easier to overcome. Which makes me think that representation of black people more in media as well as in real life would, as believed, work to undo bias and bigotry.  ......interestingly, they did the same experiment on mice, when given the choice of food or to help another mouse, mice would always help those that had the same colour/species as they. But if they housed two different mice in the same cage, and then ran the test, even different species mice would help eachother as if they were the same species.   The whole episode is chock-full of really surprising stuff, if you can find it, I recommend everyone watch it"

blackladies,3b330w,dripdroponmytiptop,10,Thu Jun 25 18:47:18 2015 UTC,"yeah this entire thing was really Captain Obvious-y, but a lot of times the people who are unable to self-reflect, only respect real numbers and real studies, so I guess it has to be done.  what was optimistic about the entire episode is one final study they did: if they made a quick 'betting' game, where everyone put in a dollar and if you wrote ""take"" on your card, you'd be left out of the raffle, but if you put in ""give"", you could put in your dollar and add to the pot. When everybody was open and talking to eachother, everyone chose to give, so everybody benefitted! But if one asshole ""poisoned"" the community by choosing to take, the community would break down and everyone would begin taking, to preserve their dollar. Trust eroded and everyone turned.  ...but then, if everyone was offered the opportunity to shuffle themselves, givers all came together and reformed the community of trust, and the takers were left to fend for themselves, alone. The predisposition of humanity as a social being always veers towards togetherness, understanding, and community first, but it only takes a little bit of poison to fuck all that up... however, it's never too late to simply abandon the community you're in that is poisoned and make up a new one that is good. It was pretty magical to watch."

Which makes me think that representation of black people more in media as well as in real life would, as believed, work to undo bias and bigotry.   This has been on my mind lately. I'm seeing areas becoming more and more mixed. The grocery store I work at, which caters to upper-middle-class people, used to employ 95% white people, and that was reflected in the customer base. Now, it's closer to 60% white people, with 30% black and 10% Asian/other (mostly Chinese, Korean and Polynesian). The customer base also varies widely, now. I particularly see tons of mixed families with very young children. Even though the area is much more racially integrated, people are so busy that they hardly ever spend time with their neighbors. In our cul-de-sac alone, we have two black families, two white families, a Serbian family, and a mixed family, but we've never had a cook-out. We tried to organize one last year, but almost everyone had to work. Thanks in part to the way our lifestyles have changed, even though there is more opportunity than ever to interact with people from so many diverse backgrounds, nobody's doing it. Which is a shame."

blackladies,3b330w,orangutangular,2,Thu Jun 25 17:05:23 2015 UTC,"Thankfully, that appears to be untrue, although the actual results of the study presumed study are still pretty troubling.   Only 29.4 percent identified the wrong person as the knife-wielder when the white man confronted the black man with the knife, and Boon and Davies did not record the responses of blacks and whites in their various groups. Most, 52.9 percent, picked the right one. But in the group where the recognition phase preceded the recall phase, 55.5 percent picked the wrong one and only 33.3 percent picked the right one. Describing the results of the experiment without describing the recognition phase, as Blake did, counts as misleading.  As mentioned above, when the recall phase preceded the recognition phase nobody incorrectly identified the black man as the knife wielder. Nobody. The Blake and Ross accounts of the experiment greatly mislead on that point.   Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, because I just learned this 5 minutes ago from google, but the ""recall phase"" is where someone tries to remember everything they can about a something they're shown (in this case, a set of drawings) they saw before (in this case, 45 minutes before). The ""recognition phase"" is where someone is shown a new set of images, and is asked to recall which ones they had been previously shown (in this case, 45 minutes before)."

It's the same as somebody falsely accusing a Black man as being violent towards White women, or  having an incident happen where the Black person is the victim and all of a sudden, the media finds their medical records, incriminating pictures of said person, showing their home address and going after any previous criminal background of the victim, family members, etc.  Whoever wrote that piece is straight up oblivious.

The first night when I put on my satin cap she was like ""are you wearing a hat!?"" lol. Then rarely she'd ask what I was doing, like when I was gelling my edges with a toothbrush.   If she says anything, it's most likely out of curiosity. Braids/twists are a really good protective hairstyle because they don't require too much daily maintenance, so I'd suggest them. Also I tried crochet braids, they required a little more maintenance (detangling them) but it was a nice change."

Plus, I'm a terrible procrastinator AND slow, so wearing it out meant super tangled hair that took an entire day to get through.  My strategy was marley twists/kinky twists/etc. I'd wear them for 2 (more like three but that's because I'm awful!!!) months, take them out, go to a salon for a trim, where they would be put in two strand twists. The TSTs that the stylist does always looks neater and lasts longer than mine. I'd wear those for a week, maybe two (taking out, washing, retwisting) and then when I had a free day, get my hair put into braid/twist extensions again."

blackladies,3b1bfv,shark_vagina,3,Thu Jun 25 04:40:27 2015 UTC,"I think you may run into some issues with food allergies (some people go through life not knowing they have one) and eating disorders which are prevalent in all communities. I think it could help people deal with eating disorders.  If you are focusing on the black community however not all poc's have a good past with food and can be triggering to some individuals so there would have to be a level of comfort between you and the patient already built so that when the sessions are taking on the addition of food those triggers can be assessed and safe coping behaviors can be constructed and put into action. Personally I fall into the later category and for me the only hurdle to getting mental help is the cost, which when incorporating food would be an additional cost on top of the services provided.   However this would work nicely as a group therapy for some individuals, working together to cook as a group and each having a job and a goal is very empowering, I think about men who have been at war or men who have been in jail and that need to be useful in the community is prevalent and adding the additional layer of food to the group therapy session could have some potential.  I don't know much about the nitty gritty of doing this, I can only give you my opinion based on my experiences so I hope this helps. I can say look into speaking with other professionals in the field to see if this is plausible or if you might need to look into another venue. Finding a psychotherapy professional who is open minded and thinks out of the box with their practice would be key.   And sorry I thought this idea was rather interesting so I looked it up and found some hopefully helpful articles through google   Good luck!"

Capitalism is exploitation, but there are levels and layers to it, and exploitation and oppression have beneficiaries as well. sorry for going on a long rant here, but i think it's crucial not to overlook how deeply connected racism as well as other form of oppression like misogyny and ableism in particular are tied to capitalism. whom is exploited by whom, who benefits, and who is entirely disregarded as human because they can't sell their labour?

blackladies,3aymsc,kaboutermeisje,3,Thu Jun 25 03:34:47 2015 UTC,"I discovered wild strawberries growing in a park yesterday, and I'm pretty sure they were from a seed bomb! They were growing in the middle of an ivy patch, in the middle of a planned-looking garden. And then: boom! strawberries! They were delicious."

blackladies,3aymsc,Kriieod,36,Thu Jun 25 03:38:41 2015 UTC,"I love the ""what about the Black gangs?!"" comments...as if Black people have to be crime free before we discuss how race-based White crime impacts us as Americans...and as if White people don't kill each other too. Not one person was like ""let's talk about White DUIs and White-on-White murder!"" post Newtown, so they can sit down with this one."

blackladies,3aymsc,flatworldart,12,Thu Jun 25 06:06:15 2015 UTC,Its the racism thats been around since europeans have been exploring the seas. This ideology that whites are superior will never cease to end just due to the fact that ideas never die.
blackladies,3aymsc,Nostradamu5,5,Wed Jun 24 15:49:35 2015 UTC,"As a white gay man who grew up in the 90s, I knew from my teenage years that straight white men are the most dangerous people in this country. Of course not all are bad, but facts are facts. Straight white men are more likely to be perpetrators in violent and white collar crimes. Rape, embezzlement, fraud, mass murder, domestic violence. If you're going to be a victim of crime you're more likely to be attacked by a straight white man than any other person demonized and vilified in the media."
