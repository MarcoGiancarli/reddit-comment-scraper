scotus,3dp1fo,lemontest,3,Sat Jul 18 02:45:57 2015 UTC,"""Strict originalism"" is a conflation of ""strict constructionism"" (which Scalia is not, but is often miscategorized as) and ""originalism"" (which he is also not, but often miscategorized as). Scalia is a textualist.   it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.   That's one of the better one-sentence summations of textualism, actually, and unsurprisingly it comes from Scalia's opinion in this case. So... yeah. The text of the statute covers this scenario, even if the writers of it didn't necessarily intend it to (thus, not originalism). It's a reasonable, rather than the narrowest possible, reading of the statute, so he's OK with it (thus not ""strict"" anything -- ""A text should not be construed strictly, and it should not be construed leniently; it should be construed reasonably, to contain all that it fairly means"" after all)."

In my own (presumably much more limited) experience, though, Scalia stands out as uncommonly intemperate in many of his opinions, especially in recent years.  I think that many federal judges (as in, more than a few) have tried to signal him about that, when they quoted one his more sarcastic bits from Windsor. As quoted, the excerpt seems to support marriage equality. That's because he was being sarcastic: He was stating, in literal terms, the opposite of the meaning that was clear from the larger context. And there's no way that that many other judges and justices did not understand that. I think it was a deliberate attempt to alert him to how his writing may be inappropriate in the grand legacy of federal opinions."

scotus,3d6ty8,patricksaurus,3,Tue Jul 14 11:58:56 2015 UTC,"All of our Supreme Court justices are from Harvard or Yale, or Columbia by way of Harvard.  Many of them were professors and even presidents of law schools.  They all served as editors for the law review, which is the publication system for legal scholarship. Each of them was greatly informed by their legal education.  Tell me what part of that makes academic law unimportant, and try to use words to make it compelling rather than your caps lock.  You might also want to ponder my conclusion about shaky rulings inviting legal challenges. That's as ""real life"" as it gets."

It's the same with medical education; surgeons teach other surgeons.  Ditto with scientists.  Whatever ax you have to grind with academia is irrelevant.  Fields that demand terminal degrees for entry level participation have those academic requirements because they are absolutely the bare basics.  When someone whose career is reading and teaching the body of constitutional law and the case law that emerges from the Supreme Court, he has a good handle on what makes for a sound ruling as opposed to a more shaky one.  This is doubly true when he's among the most respected legal scholars in the country -- the legal community doesn't put him in that position because they're all stupid and brainwashed.  Rather, he earns that distinction because he's really good at what he does."

The innate birth/civil rights vs. political/chosen rights is wholly consistent with Kennedy's libertarian jurisprudence. Kennedy makes it a point not to respond to dissents point by point. Amar does so, and as a widely respected constitutional scholar makes great points about how none of the dissenters actually make arguments about the constitution itself.   Edit: Spelling"

To dally on a new appointment would be political suicide, especially because it would cripple the necessary decisions on numerous policies that many want to see on both sides of the aisle. It would be extraordinarily bad for either party politically to play around with this, and the Republican leadership in particular learned not to mess around to that degree after the shutdown.  The other thing that's important to note is that if a Republican Senate takes hold in 2016, it will be a close thing. There will be 10 seats up for re-election for the Democrats, and 24 for the Republicans. The odds are slightly against Democrats retaking the Senate, but it is certainly doable. Especially since this is a presidential election year, and those tend to favor the president-elect...who many predict will be a Democrat.

The Loving decision differs from Obergefell in a very important respect: interracial marriage was a criminal offense. No one in Obergefell got thrown in jail. The Court was correct in decriminalizing interracial marriage - that's clearly an equal protection violation - but it overreached when 'invented' the fundamental right to marriage. It's similar to its invention of penumbras in Roe v Wade. That's the core of Roberts' dissent.
scotus,3c9hf0,the_profit_muhammad,0,Fri Jul 17 18:09:54 2015 UTC,"Can someone elaborate on the ""thwarting the democratic process"" argument.  Because as far as see it the courts, especially the Scotus as the highest court, function to judge the constitutionality of new laws in the context of whether they violate older democratically created laws.  Since the 14th Amendment claims equal protection and equal dignity under the law for all people, and people who want same sex marriage are people under the law, laws banning same sex marriage denied them protection of the 14th and their dignity.  Would you have rather the SCOTUS sat back and said ""you know these laws are unconstitutional, but someone democratically put them into place in direct contradiction to the constitution. But they were put in democratically so our hands are tied.  If some state passed a law with a majority vote that stopped specifically white men from having rights, would we have to wait for a state or federal law to be democratically passed or would we want some kind of court to step in and say, ""hey this law isn't legal.""  It's the whole point of the Courts. They judge legislative action for its constitutionality. That is their part of the checks and balances system. If they don't do that then the legislatures of the country run rampant and unchecked."
scotus,3c9hf0,AndTheMeltdowns,3,Thu Jul 9 12:57:59 2015 UTC,"The 14th Amendment says nothing of dignity.  The question was whether same sex marriage bans deprived persons of a liberty protected by the 14th. The 14th doesn't protect everything anyone can think of that they feel they should be free to do. It doesn't protect my liberty to consume certain drugs, or walk around naked outside my house, etc.  If one were to interpret with the law's intent being the determining factor, it would be hard to argue that voters/congress intended to create a federal right to same sex marriage in 1868. Not saying that's the appropriate method of interpretation, however for four of the justices ruling in the majority of this case it seemed to be the determining factor in the case decided the day prior (King v. Burwell)."
scotus,3c9hf0,aheinzm,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:35:01 2015 UTC,"I used the word dignity because it came up in the case a lot.  I see what you're saying, but when the law says ""...nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.""  Which to me clearly says, if you let one person do something you can't deny it from someone else unless you've got a reason better than they look different. So while the 14th doesn't say anything directly about marriage. If they question is do laws that ban same sex marriage deprive people of liberty, I think the really obvious answer is yes. So much of the 14th is firmly pointing to the idea that we need to treat people equally under the law, and to blatantly allow something for one group of people and not for a second would certainly deprive them of liberty.  The 14th doesn't protect their right to marriage because it's a right that they want. It protects their right to marriage because it is a right that they want, that other equal citizens in the union have, and the government has no reasonable objection to.  If the law said that everyone could do drugs and walk around naked, except carved out an exception for to 30 year old white men specifically because some people in some states were fine with women walking around drugged up and naked but didn't want to see men do that. Than the 14th would also protect you and give you grounds to strike down that law."

That was the question before the court, did the government have a reason, and a good one, to deny same-sex couples the right to marry. You, me, and 5 Associate Justices say the government of Ohio didn't have a good enough reason, but that's not alway the case. There are cases where the government can deny rights to otherwise equal citizens that are allowed to others. Look at dry counties. Many of them, particularly in the south, may only exist as Blue Laws. Maybe those are unfair and should be struck down as well, but if the Supreme Court did it nation wide, the harm that would follow in some counties, specifically northern Alaska, may well prove to be substantial. I can buy a handgun easily in Wyoming, does that mean the Supreme Court should strike down tough background checks in Chicago?  It depends on the reason.

At a slightly higher level, such as the lawyer-run Roman Catholic lobby National Organization for Marriage [sic], it's clear that there's more than a little conscious dissembling going on: Their use of the carefully worded phrase ""marriage as we have known it"" reveals this. (As it makes it clear that there are or have been other kinds, but they're defending only 'one' kind.) One might excuse that in view of the fact that they're either fiercely devoted to their cause, damn the facts, and some are being paid to shape workable polemicals.  At the level of discourse wherein Chief Justice Roberts, however, none of those excuses are available. He owes fealty to none but the U.S. Constitution, and suffers no fear of consequences (such as being impeached, or not being re-elected, or getting fired, or not getting paid). He has been vetted by our Senate, to ensure that he does not bring irrational ideas or distorted thinking to a seat which must serve all the many different people of this land.

Certainly marriage carries emotional weight between individuals, and there is an argument to be made that prohibiting gay marriage could cause harm by implicitly making heterosexual relationships more approved. However, from the perspective of the state marriage is a bunch of regulations concerning rights and responsibilities relating to child care and sharing assets, among other things.   In this sense marriage is a state regulation, like a specialised contract. The issue then is denying certain groups access to this contract, not that the states are meddling in something it shouldn't be."

scotus,3bjq3u,JCY2K,4,Mon Jun 29 22:22:10 2015 UTC,"This was decided strictly on a fundamental rights analysis. Marriage is a fundamental right; that's well established in case law. The majority opinion held that saying ""gay people can't marry someone of the same gender"" was denying the right of marriage to gay couples, similar to ""white people can't marry someone of a different race"" denied the right of marriage to interracial couples. Thus, gays were being excluded from a fundamental right, and there is clearly no plausible reason for the states to do so that can pass constitutional limits on burdening a fundamental right (strict scrutiny). As far as legislating from the bench, the reasoning of the majority is no more legislative than Loving v. Virginia was (the interracial marriage case).   The dissents essentially rest on the idea that laws banning gay marriage are, contrary to what you might think, technically laws banning a change to the definition of marriage. Thus according to the dissenters gays aren't denied that fundamental right. Keep in mind that in states permitting gay marriage there was no distinction whatsoever between same sex and opposite sex marriages and their associated privileges.   I honestly believe the reasoning is very sound under a 5th/14th amendment analysis, and I'm not worried about unintended consequences because LGBT didn't become a protected class. This decision will only apply to other fundamental rights, and there aren't many of them."

I believe that the Supreme Court has always been there to be the final decision on situations such as this. There were around 30 states that already had legal same sex marriage either through court cases or legislation. Appeal courts were ruling different things. The Court stepped in and made its decision. I feel like the Court shows tremendous judicial restraint, but people do not notice rulings unless they are major such as this one. Every time a large decision is made, people say the Court is overreaching.   Typed this in a hurry. Sorry if it isn't comprehensible in some places."

I'm persuaded by Robert's opinion that the federal constitution decides who gets to make election decisions and completely overrides the State's wishes to delegate that responsibility to the people (even if the State wants to define the people as legislature) or a commission.  Doesn't the Federal constitution get to write the definition of terms here? This seems like a giant boon for states' rights supporters while curbing the reach of the US constitution.

scotus,3bii75,jabbasi,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:51:54 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between what a State considers to be its Legislature and how it vests powers. As /u/Malik_Killian cited below, the Arizona Constitution says,   “Any law which may be enacted by the Legislature . . . may be enacted by the people under the Initiative.”   This does not mean that the people, using Initiative, are the Legislature. Thus, this passage does not define the Legislature. I think Kennedy's dissent in Hollingsworth v. Perry was right, but this case was wrong. The State can appoint people to argue their interests in court. They can give people whatever kinds of power they have to give. But when they have a body they call the Legislature, it is the Legislature... and saying that someone else has similar powers doesn't mean that this other body is actually the Legislature. Thus, when the federal Constitution says, ""Go to the Legislature,"" that's what we should do. If Arizona wants to say, ""The Legislature is the Initiative process,"" then it would be a different case."
scotus,3bii75,Im_not_JB,2,Mon Jun 29 23:40:38 2015 UTC,"I think what you're saying is correct, but it ignores the history of the initiative process, which the Founders did not have before them. They may have still intended to have legislature mean state's lawmaking power. In particular, the term Legislature was more broad during the founding, so we are not limited in reading the Elections Clause to say ""go to the legislature (as we understand that term in the 21st century)."""
scotus,3bii75,jabbasi,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:07:06 2015 UTC,"I totally get what the majority opinion is saying when they focus on functionality. In addition, it's clear that the Founders only conceived of a situation where the State had defined ""a Legislature"", so there's still complications that can arise. What happens if a State were to merely disband its ""Legislature""? ""We'll have all of our lawmaking power vested in the initiative process, thanks... but we're not going to call it our 'Legislature'."" This is the only hard case that makes it really tempting to adopt functionalism.  ...that being said, functionalism can theoretically fail, too! A State could theoretically abolish 'the lawmaking function' as it is understood. ""We think the feds and local governments can handle it. We have a minimalist state Constitution which gives some regulatory lawmaking functionality to the executive and some common law functionality to the courts. We're pretty much done here."" What then? Sure, ""law is being made"" by executive agencies and judges. Does the Elections Clause then magically come up with some combination of them to be ""the Legislature""? I don't think so.  I think the best reading of the Elections Clause is, ""We need federal elections. You [the State] go point at 'a Legislature'. Those people do this."" I think the more interesting question is whether it requires the State to do this, or if they could just say, ""No, thanks,"" and forfeit their election of Senators (Congress could step up and set everything else).  This is pure formalism, for sure. However, my personal perspective is that the only reasons to adopt functionalism are for pragmatic concerns or to avoid absurd results. I'm not big on pragmatic concerns, because there are always ways around it... and as I pointed out above, I don't think functionalism can avoid absurd results, either. I don't mind the occasional absurd result from formalism. It's easy enough for a State to just say, ""We're actually pointing to the initiative process when we say 'Legislature'."" Or, as the Chief Justice put it, they can push to amend the Elections Clause.  Edit: Note that this doesn't rely on any definition of ""Legislature"" from the Founding Era or the 21st Century. The State can call anyone it wants their ""Legislature"". In talking about Perry, I always used the example, ""The State could delegate the authority to represent them in court to Joe on the Docks. They could do so very specifically for a single issue. It doesn't make a difference whether they give him a title like Attorney Specific, because there's no requirement in the form of a name. They'd just have to be prepared to suffer the consequences of doing so."" Similarly, the State can say, ""Joe on the Docks is our Legislature."" They could even say, ""Joe doesn't actually do anything or have any powers besides what might be required of him by the US Constitution."""

This ruling only pertains to Arizona and possibly California due to precedent anyways.

scotus,3bjbeh,hitbyacar1,3,Mon Jun 29 18:14:47 2015 UTC,"Breyer does an extremely good job taking apart the argument for capital punishment to exist in the first place. If the prior SCOTUS decision to ALLOW the death penalty was ONLY if it could be implemented without capriciousness, then in its current incarnation, it must end. Scalia ignores the data that Breyer showed that ""an offender who is sentenced to death is two or three times more likely to find his sentence overturned or commuted than to be executed"" and instead simply states that the appeals process is adequate to protect unfair application of the penalty. No data; just his opinion.  Scalia is perfectly willing to allow the ""people"" to decide if capital punishment should exist in their communities, as a way of sidestepping Breyer's argument that only a few counties are responsible for the majority of executions. Counties where judges are elected, I believe.  Scalia acknowledges that some founding fathers believed in their day that the government shouldn't have the right to kill anybody. It's just that then, as now, they wouldn't win an election if they stated as such. We are a bloodthirsty nation. Revenge over reason. I therefore find it odd that Scalia does not wish to allow the People to decide the shape of their congressional districts in Arizona."

scotus,3bjbeh,desantoos,2,Tue Jun 30 03:10:16 2015 UTC,"Now that I've read through both, I think Scalia still has the upper hand in the argument.  Breyer thinks the death penalty should be unconstitutional for four reasons.  First, he says that it is cruel because many people are killed only to be found that they are innocent. I don't see this as as a strong claim. Many people serve life sentences only to be found that they are innocent. Should we remove life sentences too?  Breyer's second reason is that certain minorities are condemned to death more than majorities. I disagree that it therefore follows that the death penalty should be eliminated. Instead, more cases should come before the court regarding the unconstitutional bias of sentencing. See Sotomayor's dissent in an earlier denial of cert on the death sentence scheme in Alabama. I would have also taken that case.  The third reason Breyer brings up is that the death penalty is cruel because people are there for so long, dragged through appeals. Scalia is right: that argument makes no sense when they would have served a life sentence otherwise. And anyway, if the person wants to drag it out with their own appeals, that is their own choice. It seems senseless to make this a foundational claim for the unconstitutionality of the death penalty.  The fourth reason Breyer brings up is that it is unusual because so people are killed anymore. This reason doesn't make much sense to me.  So I agree with Scalia. I also think there's no way there will be a fifth vote for overturning the death penalty's constitutionality. However, it seems clear that there are likely five votes for the unconstitutionality of multi-year solitary confinement practices in prisons."

Technically I believe the level of abstraction at which a fundamental right should be defined was still up in the air between all of the justices (can't remember the last case where they argued over it, but I know we read it in law school.)

scotus,3bfg2j,brickses,8,Sun Jun 28 19:19:41 2015 UTC,"No.  The Court has long held that marriage is a fundamental right (that's part of why this ruling went the way it did!).   To eliminate marriage, the government would have to show that a law eliminating it was narrowly tailored to the advancement of a compelling government interest, which is hard to imagine for eliminating marriage. The government has strong interests in supporting marriage, if anything."
scotus,3bfg2j,jeopardydd,-4,Sun Jun 28 19:54:54 2015 UTC,"WRONG  Nothing requires a state to issue marriage licenses or recognize marriage generally, even after Obergefell. Identifying marriage as a ""fundamental right"" is actually a little deceptive. A ""fundamental right"" doesn't mean that the government must always and forever confer that ""right"" or privilege. It simply means that any laws restricting that right or limiting that right among people must meet the strict scrutiny/narrowly tailored standard. An across-the-board elimination of marriage is not a restriction in that sense because marriage is not an affirmatively guaranteed right in the Constitution. It would not need to meet ""strict scrutiny."" That means that in 10 years, a state could simply abolish the state recognition of any marriage, and it would be perfectly constitutional.   (Little known fact: voting is the same; it is a ""fundamental right"", but it's not actually affirmative guaranteed by the US Constitution).  However, if a state starts refusing to issue any marriage licenses today solely to avoid issuing same-sex marriage licenses, that would be a slightly different issue.

scotus,3bfg2j,jeopardydd,3,Mon Jun 29 14:24:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, it certainly is arguable that marriage is not a government thing, but rather only a religious thing.

This includes taxation, wills, trusts, who get your stuff when you die, medical decisions, etcetera. So it would seem to be all of one and none of the other at some point.  Furthermore, we have two competing fundamental issues: 1) rights inhere in individual persons, whereas groups of people may have ""powers"" conferred upon them 2) the government currently recognizes corporate personhood.  There may be some possible arrangement where two or more people form a type of corporation for the purposes of recognizing certain powers."

A VERY short synopsis:   The AZ Redistricting commission was created by amendment to the AZ Constitution through voter referendum in 2000. The applicable portions can be found here. This is copy/pasted from their website: ""The Independent Redistricting Commission's mission is to redraw Arizona’s congressional and legislative districts to reflect the results of the most recent census. The concept of one-person, one-vote dictates that districts should be roughly equal in population. Other factors to be considered are the federal Voting Rights Act, district shape, geographical features, respect for communities of interest and potential competitiveness. The state Constitution requires the commissioners – two Republicans, two Democrats and an independent chairwoman – to start from scratch rather than redraw existing districts."" I doubt that the chair of the committee has to be a female, but the current one is.  In 2010 the AZ State Legislature as a whole sued the AZIRC, stating that its existence violates the Elections Clause of the US Constitution (A1S4C1), which states that ""The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.""  The main questions are (1) is this a non-justiciable political question and, if (1) is negative, (2)what the definition of ""the Legislature thereof"" in the Elections Clause. Question (2) is especially interesting because the AZ Constitution states that the people reserve portions of legislative power in the form of a voter referrendum."

This ruling will mean any attempt to stop gerrymandering in the future will require a Constitutional Amendment, until then redistricting will be the exclusive domain of State Legislators – the proverbial fox in the hen house where gerrymandering is concerned.  I find it particularly ironic that a mere two days after Justice Roberts, Scalia, Thomas, and Alito were decrying judicial over-reach, they decide to gut an attempt at better democratic representation by striking down a law approved by popular vote. Particularly grating, yesterday Justice Roberts gave us a dissenting opinion, read from the bench no less, in which he expressed his disappointment that a democratic solution had not been more forthcoming in the question of gay marriage. He said it was not the courts place to rule on the issue and it should be resolved through available democratic channels.

scotus,3b9n2g,NoahHaders,9,Sat Jun 27 02:55:00 2015 UTC,"For whatever its worth, just finished law school and also am a SCOTUS nerd. Here's what I got from the majority opinion:  First, Justice Kennedy lays out the precedent for individual autonomy/privacy/intimacy/personal via substantive due process, citing Griswold, Loving, Baird. He argues that the right to marriage is included in substantive due process along with the right to make familial decisions such as child rearing, procreation/contraception etc. If the liberty/substantive due process right to marriage exists (which he just argued), it applies no differently to same sex couples compared to heterosexual couples.  Second, he lays out pretty emphatically that marriage is a fundamental right, and defines it broadly with respect to Glucksberg. He points to Loving, Zablocki, and Turner and argues the common theme with all those fundamental right cases is the right to marriage, irrespective of whether people of different races wanted to get married or it was prisoners. He then explains why same sex marriages should be defined the same as heterosexual marriages with respect to the fundamental right: It demeans them if we do otherwise, the children of same sex couples are harmed if we don’t recognize it, death certificates/estate taxes, benefits, the worry that crossing state line and having a tragedy could happen, etc.   Third, he argues that the equal protection clause compels that same sex couples be guaranteed the right to marry. This does get a little murky; Justice Kennedy intertwines Equal Protection and Due Process in the 14th amendment, but argues Loving did the same thing. Basically, if you infringe on people’s fundamental liberty interest, you cannot do so unequally. On page 21 of his opinion he does mention that sex based marriage classifications have been struck down, but that’s the closest he gets to the traditional “scrutiny analysis.” Reading through the opinion I’d guess that in his mind we’re at strict scrutiny but the marriage bans wouldn’t pass any heightened scrutiny. I think he has never mentioned the traditional layers of equal protection scrutiny for same sex rights cases very intentionally, which is a different discussion entirely.   Fourth/finally, he addresses some of the dissent and 6th Circuit opinion below by stating there are some rights that are not subject to the democratic process; ie we are not a democracy, we are a constitutional democracy, and the constitution sets a floor for rights that we cannot legislate out. As for the “wait and see” argument, same sex couples would suffer constitutional harm in that time, so its unacceptable   Hope this helps a bit, since we're all just armchair con law scholars if we're not on the court. Happy to discuss further."
scotus,3b9n2g,daniel_syed11,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:27:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks man. A FOQ (follow up question), if you don't mind.  Constitution mentions due process in two places, the 5th and the 14th. One difference I see, they seem to have different scopes. 14th applies only to states, while 5th applies to feds (and maybe states?). Second difference I have seen is the type of rulings. The 5th seems mostly invoked for criminal justice stuff, like miranda rights and the other ruling on friday saying the residuals clause of ACCA is too vague. the 14th seems to be invoked for a lot of these unenumerated rights stuff, but not necessarily the criminal justice stuff.  So what's up with this? Any thoughts?"
scotus,3b9n2g,daniel_syed11,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:59:51 2015 UTC,"You're correct on the difference; the 5th amendment due process right applies to federal laws/actions, while there must be ""state action"" for the 14th amendment's due process rights to apply. The 5th amendment also has an equal protection component (as of Bolling v. Sharpe). For example, DOMA was ruled unconstitutional in 2013 because it violated the 5th amendment's due process/equal protection in Windsor v. U.S. Meanwhile, yesterdays Obergfell ruling was based on the 14th because it dealt with state laws.   The ACCA is a federal law, so the Court conducted a 5th amendment due process analysis. If it had been a state criminal law, you probably would have seen the same analysis and conclusion using the 14th amendment.   The reason you see Miranda is because Miranda rights (ie those who are in custody have to be read their Miranda rights) has been read into the 5th amendment, and the 5th amendment only. Although everybody is subject to the 5th amendment, a state police officer can't go around violating Miranda."
scotus,3b9n2g,auresilvershield,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:22:20 2015 UTC,"Whoa, no - Miranda applies to all police officers, especially state police officers (don't forget - Miranda v. Arizona). Miranda relies on self-incrimination (5A) and right to counsel (6A) rights, incorporated against the states through the 14A Due Process clause. So that one is not actually a due process case stricto sensu:)  The easiest way to think of this is that the 5A and 14A Due Process clauses have the same substantive content, and extend some rights that formally would only apply to the feds, like self-incrimination, to the states; the idea is that if the feds can't deprive you of a particular right, it would be wrong to let the states do it (with very few exceptions).   Rather, what you're seeing is two different flavors of Due Process: Procedural Due Process (PDP) and Substantive Due Process (SDP). PDP is what it sounds like; you're entitled to certain process when deprived of life, liberty, or property (in the criminal, civil, or administrative context). So you're entitled to an independent judge, for instance. SDP is what remains controversial; it is how the Court reads certain basic unenumerated fundamental rights into the Constitution. Some examples are the SDP right to privacy (esp. for contraception use), and marriage (as in the case Loving v. Virginia striking down laws against interracial marriage). You're likely to see more SDP rulings in the state context, since states tend to be the ones making rules on things like marriage and abortion.  And don't forget that not all 5A cases are DP cases, there are other criminal procedural rights separately protected in it (grand jury, double jeopardy, self-incrimination).   [edit] Can't read, apparently."

scotus,3b97q0,OptionK,2,Mon Jun 29 19:03:03 2015 UTC,"well, say they label gay/lesbian as a suspect class. Sure that allows them to make the marriage equality argument, but opens up a broader argument for other areas and expands the reach of the ruling.  It could implicate businesses engaging in interstate commerce (or something substantially impacting interstate commerce) that don't want to do business with certain types for religious reasons, for example. I have to imagine there are some hokey state laws in existence or coming that protect businesses who discriminate on religious principles. A concrete solid example is really escaping me right now. I need coffee.   Don't get me wrong - I think LGBT should be a protected class,  but the Supreme Court usually doesn't like to expand a ruling further than they have to. Instead of admitting the LG community is a suspect class, they kicked that can down the road and just addressed the marriage issue narrowly. So I guess to answer your question, I think implicitly any law putting a burden on same sex marriage in the future would be subject to strict scrutiny, but they would not want give LG suspect classification unless they had to because then strict scrutiny would apply far beyond burdens on marriage.   ¯l(ツ)/¯"

scotus,3b97q0,goalslammer,2,Sat Jun 27 16:15:44 2015 UTC,"I could be sympathetic to the dissent if the concept of marriage was limited to the legal union itself. Only it's not. The protections that marriage provides, and denies certain classes of unions, results in actual cases of being denied hospital visitations of your sick partner, homelessness due to loss of property to the family of a deceived partner, etc., etc. The injustices are very very real. This is why the idea of civil unions was floated for gay couples over the past decade. Only these remain problematic in that they still only provide a small subset of protections per the states will.  Scalia's dissent on DOMA actually helped push gay marriage through. He effectively admitted that laws restricting gay marriage were a ""bare desire to harm."" It is a fundamental principle of law that laws, even moralistic laws, must have an objective to protect a valid state interest. A bare desire to harm a certain class of individuals cannot form the basis of a valid law. This was why DOMA was named the ""Defense of Marriage Act,"" on the theory that it harmed traditional marriage. Thus lower courts quoted Scalia's own dissent on DOMA as the grounds for ruling anti-gay marriage laws unconstitutional. Scalia inadvertently did gay marriage the greatest possible favor.   Why does the dissenting feel that marriage isn't a natural right protected by the Constitution?   State sanctioned marriage, in the form of licensing, didn't even exist until states wanted to start restricting interracial marriage. It's hard to argue something is a right, as defined under federal law, when the institution itself originally had no basis in state or federal law.  Yet given the injustice, and bare desire to harm this class of people, how do you justify denying these people a remedy? So even given grounds for sympathizing with the dissent, with a desire to remain neutral toward gays, how do you justify a law in which its only purpose is to harm that group? You can't, and that's exactly what Scalia conceded, and undid the anti-gay arguments, in his dissent on DOMA."

They were just having a hard time getting around the state interest issue until Scalia's dissent. The anti-gay marriage crowd knew the argument rested on the Constitution’s Due Process and Equal Protection provisions. Not an issue of a fundamental right to marry. This is why DOMA was named the Defense of Marriage Act, to imply a legitimate state interest that didn't rest on a bare desire to harm gays.  Hence the entire legal calculus for blocking gay marriages rested on establishing legitimate state interest. Here's an article that goes through this caculous, and the effects of United States v. Windsor, Scalia's DOMA reference in his dissent.  http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2015/04/understanding-the-same-sex-marriage-supreme-court-cases/   “As I have said, the real rationale of today’s opinion, whatever disappearing trail of its legalistic argle-bargle one chooses to follow, is that DOMA is motivated by ‘ “bare . . . desire to harm” ’couples in same-sex marriages. … How easy it is, indeed how inevitable, to reach the same conclusion with regard to state laws denying same-sex couples marital status,” Scalia said in 2013.   There, he said it, handing the gay rights crowd a winning argument on a silver platter.  He effectively admitted state laws denying same-sex couples marital status was a bare desire to harm. This dissent was afterward explicitly quoted by lower courts as the ground for why individual state laws against gay marriage were unconstitutional.    And many federal circuit courts since then have quoted Scalia and Kennedy in their decisions to overturn same-sex marriage bans that had been approved by state voters and lawmakers. But in November 2014, the federal Sixth Circuit Appeals Court, in a 2-1 decision, upheld same-sex marriage bans in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee.   Now the stage is set for the final showdown... Obergefell."

Pp. 10–27.    The Fourteenth Amendment mentioned refers to the equal protection clause. Which is what invalidates a law predicated on a bare desire to harm. If a legitimate state interest existed then gays would ostensibly be protected by these state interest, even if it cost them some limited freedoms.

The SCOTUS's job is the process, not the result. It completely short-circuits the democratic process, which was definitely moving in the right direction in this area. I think this will be a long-term hindrance to the acceptance of gay rights, in the same way that Roe v Wade polarized the abortion issue. I'm in favor of abortion, but I strongly believe that had Roe v Wade been decided correctly then we never would have had nutcases bombing abortion clinics. But, sadly, extremism is the inevitable result of dictatorial politics.   I mean, what's even the point of the legislative process if it's up to the Court to arbitrarily decide what the meaning of 'liberty' is? If that's the process, then why did we need the 19th amendment? Shouldn't the court have simply decided that voting was a 'substantive right'?  I agree 100% with Roberts' dissent."

Is there a mary poppins style bag of unenumerated rights, and depending on the politicial era different rights are identified and pulled out of the mary poppins bag? This seems not right.  What's scary about Loving is that it wasn't just a crime to <i>get married</i> in Virginia, it was a crime to <i>be</i> married in Virginia. The Lovings had been married in DC, where it was legal, But they were living in VA at the time of the police raid. The other thing is it was a criminal offense and they both were sentenced to a year in prison!

The people who passed the Fourteenth Amendment wouldn't have argued that it protected gender but as time goes forward, people read it to also include gender-based discrimination. What it boils down to is whether the Constitution is a living document or not.  It is different in degree but not different in kind. Loving's (you do italics with a *) facts arose from a criminal law but it offered the proposition that a state cannot prohibit people from marrying (or from being married) to a person of a different race. This was a theretofore unknown constitutional right.  What was more to the point of my response to /u/the_profit_muhammad (and Chief Justice Roberts) is that Loving was done by the Court not state legislatures (or voters directly). Was that wrong?

And if you're celebrating today's outcome in a way that is sensible, you'd say that it is that inherent dignity that makes denying him a marriage license wrong.

The fact that they are human provides for their inherent dignity.

Among the prevailing types of theories that attempt to account for the existence of humor, there are psychological theories, the vast majority of which consider humor to be very healthy behavior; there are spiritual theories, which may—for instance—consider humor to be a gift from ""God""; and there are also theories that consider humor to be an inexplicable mystery, very much like a mystical experience.  Although various classical theories of humor and laughter may be found, in contemporary academic literature, three theories of humor appear repeatedly: relief theory, superiority theory, and incongruity theory.  Among current humor researchers, there is no consensus about which of these three theories of humor is most viable.  Proponents of each one originally claimed their theory to be capable of explaining all cases of humor;   However, they now acknowledge that although each theory generally covers its own area of focus, many instances of humor can be explained by more than one theory.

As a graduate student in linguistics, this is another thing about Scalia that makes me shake my head. As to your fourth quote, the Full Faith and Credit clause of the Constitution does not allow states to disregard the status of marriages made in other states--even if a state banned same-sex marriage, it would have to accept that citizens of theirs who participated in same-sex marriage in other states were married!  I interpret your first quote as sarcasm, which sets the tone for the whole thing; and I don't feel like I have enough context to respond to the third quote."

Well when the 14th was ratified, nobody doubted the constitutionality of state-sponsored segregation, either. It was almost another century before SCOTUS cleared that up. Does he think SCOTUS should have kept their nose out of Brown v. Board of Education too?  This constructionism is just Scalia's default modus operandi whenever he's too intellectually lazy to come up with a real argument."

However, if the chief justice is not in the majority, then the most senior judge (i.e. who has been there the longest) gets to decide who writes the opinion. Kennedy has been on the bench the longest (which is why he always writes the big majority opinions on 14th amendment issues), and Scalia the second longest. While Roberts and Scalia are both often on the same side, if Scalia wants to write an opinion, Roberts probably defers to him out of respect. That being said, dissenting judges often each write their own opinion."

And this decision is far more statutory construction than Constitutional interpretation anyway, so the Court has (should have) a far less active role.  Roberts put it best with this passage:  ""Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them. If at all possible, we must interpret the Act in a way that is consistent with the former, and avoids the latter.""  Read in isolation, or reading the dissent only, you'd think this was a new-fangled interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause (when in fact, the dissent has to grasp at straws - and dust off the Elections Clause, of all provisions, to find some footing).  But in the context of analyzing a sentence in a piece of legislation, it's hard to follow the four alarm fire tone from Scalia.  After all, it's not like the Court just changed 30 years of 1st Amendment law in one shot like it did in Citizens United."

scotus,3b4erg,fingawkward,2,Fri Jun 26 01:34:02 2015 UTC,"What Scalia finds unconstitutional is the requirement that people must buy insurance.    Without these provisions, Scalia noted, premiums would be much more expensive, since the healthiest consumers -- who are the most profitable for the insurance industry -- would choose not to buy policies. The federal subsidies intended to make insurance affordable would have to be larger, and Scalia argued that the court didn't have the authority to insist that the government spend far more money than Congress had intended.   Hence the unconstitutional ""leg,"" in Scalia's opinion, has is already decided case law, which Scalia lost. It IS in fact constitutional under case law.   Hence Scalia's dissent in this case has nothing to do with constitutionality. Rather he's a sore loser and wanted to use this case to kick the legs out from under the previous case he also lost on. This claim is fully justified by the fact of Scalia's own words, as pointed out in the article. Just because he's a SCOTUS judge doesn't give him unilateral authority to define what is and isn't constitutional.   Edit: Maybe I've been up too long, and don't mind the down votes.

scotus,3atphs,merhmet,15,Tue Jun 23 12:52:34 2015 UTC,"I'm hopping on the 5-4 train, but I think it will be Justice Kennedy writing for the appellants, striking down the states' SSM bans.    I think Justice Kennedy's opinion will focus on the substantive due process right to marry, while the 4 liberal justices in the majority will also join a concurrence that reaches the same conclusion on Equal Protection Clause grounds, applying something more demanding than rational basis review.  If I had to guess who would write that concurrence, I would guess Justice Breyer.  I predict the main dissent will be authored by Chief Justice Roberts, with a measured argument about federalism -- emphasizing that the states have the exclusive power to regulate marriage, and sidestepping the SDP/EQP issues.  And I bet Justices Scalia and Thomas will join that, and will also each write their own dissent; I think that Justice Scalia will make a slippery slope argument along with an argument that this is a political decision, and a result that should have been accomplished through the political process.  I think that Justice Thomas will focus more on the originalist argument that moral opprobrium of homosexuality is so traditional and so longstanding that there cannot be a ""penumbra right""' to live that lifestyle within the Constitution."
scotus,3atphs,Gmonkeylouie,7,Tue Jun 23 15:03:36 2015 UTC,"5-4, yes, but I have two disputes.  1) There's no way Kennedy will make a due process right to marry argument. He's read the 10th Circuit decision and knows that it's overbroad. By defining the right to marry in terms of preferences, the court unwittingly made all the legal arguments necessary to justify poly/group marriage. He'll be consistent with his own prior decisions and rule that marriage laws are an affront to the dignity of gay people as a class (he's big on dignity).  2) There's also no way that Thomas' dissent will appeal to moral opprobrium. He'll just say that the Constitution is silent on marriage and so states have the authority to define it. Assuming Kennedy's argument is as above, he'll say that dignity is a mystical concept, the protection of which is not found in the Constitution.  EDIT: I suspect someone is going to bring up interracial marriage. It's complicated because while antimiscegenation laws facially discriminated on the basis of race, current marriage laws in Michigan, etc. do not mention sexual orientation (just sex), and don't appear to have been created with a concept of orientation or a gay class in mind. In other words, they were originally written because of what people thought marriage was (a sexually complementary union ordered toward childbearing and childrearing). So it can truthfully be said that current marriage laws don't discriminate on the basis of orientation, unless you assume (on top of the Constitution) that marriage is a formalization of orientation."
scotus,3atphs,tualatin,3,Wed Jun 24 16:41:33 2015 UTC,"the court unwittingly made all the legal arguments necessary to justify poly/group marriage.   I think even if we assume the marriage right is broad enough to encompass these folk, we have a compelling interest in keeping marriage structured as pairs only. Anything else would require wholesale rewriting of thousands if not tens of thousands of state and federal statutes/programs."

scotus,3atphs,eljew,12,Tue Jun 23 20:05:12 2015 UTC,Because he's more pragmatic than conservative.
scotus,3atphs,tualatin,5,Tue Jun 23 14:18:17 2015 UTC,"At oral argument he was deeply skeptical that same-sex marriage was part and parcel of the fundamental right to marriage as it has been understood in this country.  By contrast, his questions did suggest that he viewed same-sex marriage bans as clear gender discrimination (which they are). A gender-discrimination route would also not apply to cousin marriage, and certainly not plural marriage, in the same way that fundamental-right based opinion would.   I personally believe that both routes--fundamental right or gender discrimination--are perfectly supportable."
scotus,3atphs,eljew,2,Tue Jun 23 14:19:19 2015 UTC,"To the gender discrimination point, the argument is complicated by the fact that marriage law 1) doesn't discriminate against either men or women as a class, 2) doesn't separate men from women and 3) can at least appeal to some feature of maleness or femaleness that is relevant to the reality of marriage (i.e. procreation).  (In contrast, antimiscegenation laws 1) were introduced in the context of nineteenth century American anti-black prejudices, 2) had the effect of separating blacks and whites and 3) drew lines based on race, which has never formed a basis for the purpose or form of the marriage institution.)"
scotus,3atphs,tualatin,5,Tue Jun 23 15:33:20 2015 UTC,"Let's take each point in turn:  1) ""Same-sex marriage bans don't discriminate against men or women as a class""  This argument was made and rejected in Loving v. Virginia. The state argued that the anti miscegenation law didn't discriminate against races as a class because everyone -- black or white -- was prohibited from marrying someone of a different race. SCOTUS didn't buy it: whether you could marry X person depended on your race.   2) ""Same-sex marriage bans don't separate men from women.""  This has nothing to do with whether a law facially discriminates on the basis of gender. That's why SCOTUS has struck down different drinking ages for men vs. women, different jury duty requirements, different inheritance procedures, etc.   3) ""Same-sex marriage bans can appeal to some feature of maleness/femaleness, like procreation.""  Let's just assume that's true for sake of argument. The threshold for gender discrimination is a higher than just pointing to ""some feature"" related to gender. Intermediate scrutiny requires an ""exceedingly persuasive justification"" for discriminating on the basis of sex, and appeals to tradition are not enough. The states need to show an ""important government interest"" that they're trying to further (possibly encouraging biological procreation between legally bound couples), but then they ALSO need to show that withholding marriage from gay couples is ""substantially related to that interest."" The states did not even try to offer an explanation that would meet anything but rational basis (if that)."
scotus,3atphs,Neurokeen,2,Wed Jun 24 16:35:11 2015 UTC,"1) Okay, but race-based classifications and sex-based classifications are treated differently in the law. In either case, it was true in Loving that the law did not facially discriminate against blacks or whites as a class. The court didn't say, ""laws can't deal with race"", they said ""the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discrimination"" (that's a quote). In that case, there really was an intent to harm blacks. In the current case, there is no intent to harm men or women.  2) The states' argument in Loving was: ""Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents. And, but for the interference with his arrangement, there would be no cause for such marriage. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix."" The theme of separation was a major part of the interracial marriage question, but not of same-sex marriage. So it's relevant as a distinction from Loving in that nobody is arguing for gay people to be separated from straight people.  3) The court held in Nguyen v. INS that the government could apply more restrictive laws to men because of the nature of male paternity versus female motherhood. It makes sense, analogously, that the government could extend different benefits to a woman depending on whether she is in a relationship with a man or a woman, because in the first case there is the possibility of conception.  But I have to go back to 1) here. In these symmetric sex-based classifications, (honest question) has the court ever held the law to a high standard? Have single-sex athletic teams at public schools been banned? Is there an exceedingly persuasive justification for that requirement? Single-sex bathrooms? And so on."
scotus,3atphs,eljew,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:43:22 2015 UTC,"Gender discrimination, while wholly supportable (and in my opinion, actually quite right as a practical matter), opens up entirely new territories that even Roberts would be hesitant to touch. For example, it opens up claims against employment discrimination against LGB persons as being sex-based. If this is the route the Justices go, expect to see the EEOC take on much more broad powers for protecting all LGBT employees. (T is already included by policy of treating it as sex-based discrimination.)"

When I was young, one needed a Good Reason to divorce in California.  One only needed to want a divorce in Nevada.  It was a Nevada industry.  California was required to honor the divorce while not required to grant divorce ""just because."""
scotus,3atphs,outlier_lynn,3,Thu Jun 25 23:30:10 2015 UTC,"I've been considering this outcome as well. The first question is difficult and requires several (perfectly rational) logical steps to get to a requirement for allowing SSM without allowing polygamy, cousin marriage or other nonsense.   On the other hand, the recognition question is plain as day to me and I'm surprised these laws weren't overturned years ago. Article 4 is very clear that states must recognize each others' marriages. If interstate ssm recognition is not required, it's hard to imagine what a state would be required to recognize. Truck drives would have to get 30 different drivers licenses."
scotus,3atphs,callius,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:32:52 2015 UTC,"I believe that States are not required, at present, to recognize some marriages performed in other states under certain conditions.  States that allow very close relatives to marry might be recognized.  That is a hole the Court has drilled into the straight forward language of Full Faith and Credit.  The government has very limited interest in marriage. For all the arguments made in favor of government interference in the relationships of its citizens, the only one that holds water is this:  The state has an interest in promoting stable economic units.  Yes, that is good for kids, but that isn't the reason.  It costs a log of money to help those who are not in stable economic units.  For this reason, the contract that is civil marriage should be expanded greatly. That would include marriages that have more than two principles.  The problem with implementing plural marriage is the massive number of marriage laws that would need changing.  And what happens when a plural marriage ends or partially ends?    So, that said...    My position is that the thing we call ""civil marriage"" should be eliminated in favor of straight contract law that doesn't restrict the number or gender of participants."

I have a feeling it will be 5-4 with Justice Kennedy siding with the liberal wing of the court. However, because of the remarks made by Chief Justice Roberts during oral arguments stemming from gender discrimination, it could potentially be a 6-3 win.  On the flip side however, it could be a 5-4 ruling upholding current bans on SSM due to Federalism being more important in their eyes. We will not see Scalia vote in favor of SSM, of that I'm 99% sure.  It honestly is a flip of a coin at the moment, as the only thing that suggest the conservative wing would rule in favor of SSM would be gender discrimination at this point in time. We will see in a few days time, and it would be nice to get it before the last day of term. If I had to guess the best day they would rule on this, it will be Friday or Tuesday at the end of term. Friday so news media may report on it, or so the last few days are slow days. Tuesday would make more sense though, as it's the last day in the term.  Who knows though, we may even see it tomorrow.

If Texas accepts a plate saying Go Rice, are drivers really going to read that plate and think that Texas publicly makes a stance against the Longhorns?  Also, he lists many reasons making a distinction between a monument (which is a representation of govt speech) and this program.  I also originally agreed with the majority, in the argument that if it wasn't a representation of govt speech, there wouldn't have been a review board that approved or denies messages.

To be fair, the Republic of Texas was not antagonistic towards the Union or formerly a part of it at the time of it's formation.  Nor did it engage in hostilities with the Union.

Ayala:   These are but a few examples of the expert scholarship that, along with continued attention from the legal community, no doubt will aid in the consideration of the many issues solitary confinement presents. And consideration of these issues is needed. Of course, prison officials must have discretion to decide that in some instances temporary, solitary confinement is a useful or necessary means to impose discipline and to protect prison employees and other inmates. But research still confirms what this Court suggested over a century ago: Years on end of near-total isolation exacts a terrible price. See, e.g., Grassian, Psychiatric Effects of Solitary Confinement, 22 Wash. U. J. L. & Pol’y 325 (2006) (common side-effects of solitary confinement include anxiety, panic, withdrawal, hallucinations, self-mutilation, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors). In a case that presented the issue, the judiciary may be required, within its proper jurisdiction and authority, to determine whether workable alternative systems for long-term confinement exist, and, if so, whether a correctional system should be required to adopt them.   Could this be the end for year-long stints in solitary confinement? Could that practice soon be rendered unconstitutional?"

It's that there's a difference between regulating a market and banning a market.  The starting point is that Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause is limited to interstate commerce. Where goods do not move in interestate commerce, it's hard for Congress to do much.  So when Congress sets up a regulatory regime, i.e., putting controls on a product for which there is a legal market, there's a good argument to be made that as long as goods stay intrastate, the overall effect on the regulatory regime is minimal.   That's not necessarily the case when Congress is banning the interstate trafficking of goods outright. The goal there is not to just regulate a market, but to eliminate it entirely. As such, even purely  intrastate commerce can have a dramatic effect on the interstate market.   The Court reasoned that this distinction justified purely intrastate regulation of banned goods."

No, I shouldn't have mixed a ""statement of general principles"" with a specific legal term ""true threat."" I made it seem like a subjective test (""what did the listener think?"") rather than an objective test. I'll edit my post to reflect that.  However,    Whereas the Supreme Court would likely adopt a standard that includes some scienter requirement on the part of the speaker.   I'm not sure about that. A scienter requirement, yes, should be needed for the commission of a crime. But is not a ""true threat"" an objective thing, that exists regardless of the intention of the speaker? A homicide is an objective thing (the killing of one human by another). But whether the homicide is a murder, or an accident, or something else, depends (in part) on the scienter of the actual killer.   A ""true threat"" is likely one that an objectively reasonable person would believe is a serious expression of intent to do harm. Whether making a true threat is a crime, however, should depend on the mental state of the speaker.  Context matters, of course. Who is the speaker. Their relationship to the threatened parties. Their tone. Medium. Proximity. History. But do we expect the ""objectively reasonable person"" to divine intent? Or should intent be a subjective test, about the intentions of this speaker, and be a separate question for a jury to address?   So a jury could be asked to decide 1) would an objectively reasonable observer, hearing these words from this person in this circumstances, take them as a serious expression to do harm? And then 2) did the speaker communicate these words in this manner through accident (""I didn't mean to send the email! I was just venting and clicked the wrong button!""), negligence, recklessness, or with intent to terrorize? And then punishment (or not) would depend on that?  Is that reasonable? That the threat test be objective so that the standard does not become that of the most sensitive of listeners, but the mens rea test be subjective, so as only to punish those with guilty minds, and not those who act innocently (even if naively)?"
scotus,385irr,horsebycommittee,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:37:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about that. A scienter requirement, yes, should be needed for the commission of a crime. But is not a ""true threat"" an objective thing, that exists regardless of the intention of the speaker? A homicide is an objective thing (the killing of one human by another). But whether the homicide is a murder, or an accident, or something else, depends (in part) on the scienter of the actual killer.   ""True threat"" is a First Amendment question, not a criminal law one. So I agree that looking to criminal scienter requirements may not answer the question, but as you note later in your post, context is important to distinguish between true threats (which genuinely claim both ability and willingness to cause harm) and ""untrue"" threats (where either ability or willingness is absent). I think that's where the homicide analogy falls apart. There's no such thing as an ""untrue"" killing. The same words, spoken with the same tone of voice, to the same audience, but by different speakers or in different environments can be vastly different in their impact and ability to cause genuine fear (whether or not the speaker intends to cause such fear).  If the First Amendment doesn't require courts to consider the intent of the speaker, then it seems to offer very poor protection to people who are more likely to inadvertently cause fear in others (racial minorities, men, disfigured, or socially awkward) and provide extra protection to people who are attractive, female, or smaller (even if they mean to threaten)."
scotus,385irr,LikesToSmile,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:34:26 2015 UTC,"I believe in my college law class our teacher said that some generally held beliefs about what constitutes a true threat are:  There has to be a specific threat and it has to have a high likelihood of occurring. There are also some special considerations for political opposition that may sound like a threat.    Examples: I gonna kill someone one of these day - not specific  I'm going to bomb russia on tuesday - requires context but unless I have the means to accomplish this, there is no way its happening  If they reinstate the draft, I'm going to run over my senator - specific, and seemingly something the writer could do, but it is most likely protected political speech"

scotus,385irr,mywan,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:04:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I realize I shouldn't have mixed a ""statement of general principles,"" that it's not okay to make people fear for their lives, with a specific legal term, like ""true threat."" That made it seem like I was saying the threat test is subjective and not objective. I edited my post to clarify.  The test for what constitutes a threat should definitely be objective, or the standard becomes the standard of the most sensitive of dainties. ""The eggshell observer.""    They all assumed that these were true threats, but they didn't actually do a true threat analysis, presumably because they were trying to dodge having to decide the question of whether an objectively reasonable person would consider rap lyrics posted on social media to be a serious expression of an intent to cause harm. Which is annoying, because deciding that question was the reason this was supposed to be an interesting case in the first place.   I don't think they dodged the question. The ""reasonable person"" should exist in the minds of jurors, right? The jurors thought a reasonable person would see these as threatening. And I think that's born out by the fact that so many people acted in response to Elonis' statements. I'm not saying the test should be subjective. But when deciding what an objectively reasonable person would think, juries tend to put themselves in the situation. Everybody thinks they're reasonable. If they have greater self-awareness and realize they are atypical in some way that matters, they should substitute in ""an average person"" or a ""typical person."" Kind of like taking a poll then?  Well, placed in the real situation, his ex-wife took the threats seriously enough to report him and get a restraining order. But that's a subjective test. His wife could be overreacting. But also his boss fired him for his statements, and reported him. And his other friends and family on FaceBook reported him. And the FBI agent thought his words against her were serious (I'm NOT making a ""well the cops say so"" argument. I'm saying in this case one of the people threatened happened to be an FBI agent). These are all subjective tests, but how many subjective tests add up to ""the objective test?""   So I don't see how one can reasonably argue ""a reasonable person wouldn't take this seriously,"" unless all of these people who knew him best are unreasonable. I can believe one of the people who reported him was being unreasonable. Two, sure. But it seems unlikely that all these people were unreasonable. So while the test should be objective, the sampling of these subjective tests would indicate to me the jury applied an acceptable objective test.  I think what's more interesting is the intent aspect. It seems in ""true threat"" tests they're bundling the intent of the speaker into the objective test. Should it be? Shouldn't the threat exist objectively (what would an objectively reasonable person think of the seriousness of a threat in this context with this tone said by a speaker with this history and familiarity in this medium, etc), but the intent of the communication of the threat be a subjective test? What did THIS speaker intend? And then leave it to the legislatures (or judges when the legislature doesn't act) to met out different punishments (or no punishment) for different levels of intent?  For instance, what if Elonis had, instead of posting words about murdering his ex-wife on FaceBook, had emailed them directly to her? How could an objectively reasonable person not think a graphic description of their death at the hands of a furious ex-spouse delivered directly to them constitutes a true threat?  But what if it were sent on accident? Pulled up the email client, poured his bile into it, but then instead of clicking ""delete"" he accidentally clicked ""send"" instead? I think that's even a piece of advice I've seen on /r/LifeProTips and elsewhere. When you're mad at somebody, write them a nasty letter and then tear it up. Should he be punished criminally for that? While yes, it's definitely a threat any reasonable person would take seriously, it was not communicated with intent to terrorize. So no mens rea, no crime?   Obviously it would be up to the jury to determine if the sender did so ""accidentally"" or not.  So, a jury could be asked two questions: 1) Is this a communication a reasonable person would think was a serious threat to do harm in this context, and 2) what was the state of mind of the speaker? Did they intend to threaten? Threaten recklessly? Negligently? Accidentally?   Would that be reasonable?  In this case I would think 1) a reasonable person would take these as true threats. I probably would. Lots of people who knew him did. At the least I would find it impossible to say ""a reasonable person couldn't take this seriously."" And then 2) I would say he communicated somewhere between negligently and recklessly. He clearly knew people were taking his words seriously and continued making them. But, he also made posts explicitly stating that he was not serious. He seemed to think that was good enough. That shows that while he knew his actions were being taken seriously, he cared, and took steps to mitigate damage. If he hadn't, that would have been reckeless (knew people were being terrorized and didn't care). If he honestly believed that would assuage people's fears, then he's an idiot, but that's not a crime, and his actions were merely negligent, because a reasonable person should know that's not good enough."

scotus,379iog,hitbyacar1,9,Mon May 25 23:43:09 2015 UTC,"Equity as a legal concept comes from the English legal system ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(legal_concept) ), and is effectively built around doing what is fair to the wronged party - this could be specific performance of an act, an injunction, recission, rectification, or a whole list of other options.  Basically, in the beginnings of the english legal system, common law was very ridgid, and didn't always have a solution to a problem - infact, you could only use a small number of rather specific writs to get the court to act.   So, people started petitioning the Crown directly, for 'equitable relief' - those claiming had to do so quickly (delay defeats equity) and must have acted fairly (he who relies on equity must come with clean hands). Since these decisions came directly from the Crown, they had a far wider remit than the Common Law writs. Eventually, the number of cases before the court of Equity grew too large for the king to manage, and he apointed a Lord Chencellor to handle the Court of Equity instead.  Precidents in this court were called Maxims, and in the Earl of Oxford case in 1616 (where claimants claimed in both the Common Law courts and the Court of Equity) it was declaired by King James the First that Equity was above Common Law.  All of this came to an end  in 1873-5 in the Judicture Acts that made radical and sweeping changes to the English legal system - the most notable being the merging of Common Law and Equity into a single legal and court system.  I hope that helps!"

The Chancery, the office of equity, was the ""office that issued the writs that were the foundation of the common law system"".   Equity is wholly ""unaffected by any state laws” (Pomeroy) and is ""everything, even without law"".   Equity is commonly said to ""mitigate the rigor of common law"", allowing courts to use their discretion and apply justice in accordance with natural law. In practice, modern equity is limited by substantive and procedural rules, and English and Australian legal writers tend to focus on technical aspects of equity. Twelve ""vague ethical statements"", known as the maxims of equity,   guide the application of equity, and an additional five can be added.   A historical criticism of equity while it developed was that it lacked fixed rules, with the Lord Chancellor occasionally judging in the main according to his conscience. The rules of equity later lost much of their flexibility, and from the 17th century onwards, equity was rapidly consolidated into a system of precedents much like its common-law cousin.

There are issues around who is it that makes the medical decisions, you know, in the time of crisis. I assume there'd be lots of family disruption issues, setting aside issues of coercion and consent and so on that just don't apply here, when we're talking about two consenting adults who want to make that mutual commitment for as long as they shall be.

scotus,34ec5x,gnothi_seauton,2,Thu Apr 30 14:00:44 2015 UTC,"The sex discrimination case strikes me as backwards.  The right to marriage is strange conceptually.  It is a right to have the state take affirmative action to confer a legal status.  Well, what kind of relationships does the state have an interest in regulating in the first place?  I would hope the answer isn't that the state has a general interest in regulating consensual bonds of mutual affection.  The scope of its ability to regulate personal relationships ought to be narrower.  Which consensual bonds of mutual association are problematic enough for the state to justify interference?  Gender becomes relevant to the answer to that question."
scotus,34ec5x,NeverEverGoingToPost,3,Thu Apr 30 20:49:26 2015 UTC,"Well, respondents are arguing the state interest in procreation, children having parents that theoretically could conceive, etc.  But really the main state interest is the civil benefits marriage gives: tax, immigration, healthcare, inheritance, power of attorney, etc. It's just always been the case that married couples have certain distinctions legally.  State doesn't (theoretically) care about the religious/personal side of marriage. That's why Jewish rabbis can refuse to marry a Jew and a non-Jew, and why some Christians will always be able to not marry a same sex couple. The county clerk just always have to be an available alternative."
scotus,34ec5x,gnothi_seauton,2,Thu Apr 30 21:02:46 2015 UTC,"Certainly, marriage has a nexus with those benefits.  They are very compelling reasons why people would want to be married.  They are also compelling reasons not to exclude couples from the definition of marriage.    Marriage, however, doesn't feel like a way to regulate immigration.  A partner being able to immigrate feels more like an exception to normal immigration laws.  Does a state have an interest in regulating personal relationships because it is an easier way to assign power of attorney?  It certainly is a better solution for inheritance than channeling it through adult adoption.  Our property rules for inheritance grew out of a model where one spouse was economically dependent on the other.  We have moved to a social model that favors mutual financial independence to promote gender equality.  Does granting a right to marry to regulate an outdated understanding of property make sense?    Forgive me.  I come at this from an strange angle.  When Roberts asks about his polyamorous lawyers, I don't see any problem with that other than why is the government regulating it in the first place.  My response isn't analogous to let's close the schools if we have to integrate.  I assume pair-bonding for some people is real and meaningful.  Why, however, should we legally elevate pair-bonds over other possible arrangements?  Is it a majoritarian argument?  I can't see a reasonable distinction.  I do think that Scalia is conceptually correct about Rabbis and Christians not being able to conduct civil marriage.  That is the simplest answer.  Is it really acceptable for people acting on the governments behalf to discriminate?  Obviously, you could simply not enforce the law.  The other option would be to allow a RFRA-like exception.  However, ""Something something efficiency something something religious beliefs, thus it is constitutional"" feels like it dodges the issue."
scotus,34ec5x,MELBOT87,9,Thu Apr 30 22:33:08 2015 UTC,"The slippery slope fallacy isn't always a fallacy. If a reinterpretation of the law opens up news possible consequences, then you need a limiting principle to distinguish one concept from another. Because if an actual polygamous family wants to sue on the basis that their rights have been violated - you have to have a principle by which you can say the state isn't discriminating when denying marriage."
scotus,34ec5x,Blahblahblahinternet,3,Thu Apr 30 15:59:59 2015 UTC,"The slippery slope is not really a fallacy at all. It's what people say who have just enough information to be aware of formal, mathematical logic, and then apply the term loosely elsewhere."
scotus,34ec5x,LaughingIshikawa,2,Thu Apr 30 20:43:08 2015 UTC,"Well you'd need a limiting principle if you wanted to limit the possible consequences.  But setting aside the likelihood for a moment, isn't it possible that the court could render a verdict which effectively legalizes both gay marriage and plural marriage?  I guess I took that line of questioning as the Justice asking whether they were petitioning for such a verdict - ie defining the scope of the case."
scotus,34ec5x,MELBOT87,6,Thu Apr 30 16:53:49 2015 UTC,"isn't it possible that the court could render a verdict which effectively legalizes both gay marriage and plural marriage?   Yes, that is my point. Alito is looking for a limiting principle that makes it a fundamental right to marry who you want, but not that you can marry multiple people.   It might appear as a slippery slope argument, but without a limiting principle, it just takes the next lawsuit to bring it up and be back discussing the same subject."
scotus,34ec5x,LaughingIshikawa,4,Thu Apr 30 17:02:25 2015 UTC,"I think if you base a ruling on having a fundamental right to marry who you want, you already open the door to arguments that people should be allowed to marry multiple people, if that is what you (and they) want.  If you're trying to limit the scope of the ruling, I think I like what one of the other justices said (I believe) which was essentially: This is a straight sex discrimination case - If you take Bob and ask who is allowed to marry him, a man can't but a women can.  You can't discriminate based on sex, so you if you allow a woman to marry a man you have to allow for a man marrying a man as well.  Which would, I assume, allow the states to decide for themselves whether they would allow plural marriages, since they could argue it's not discriminatory, and not a fundamental right."
scotus,34ec5x,MELBOT87,3,Thu Apr 30 17:19:23 2015 UTC,I agree with everything you said. I was merely trying to explain where Alito was coming from.
scotus,34ec5x,LaughingIshikawa,2,Thu Apr 30 17:23:43 2015 UTC,"Ah.  I'm just trying to wrap my head around it too.  I think about philosophical-ish issues a lot, but not often is a legal context.  I do see what you're saying, and I really liked that you brought this up.  Slippery slope arguments are, I think, ironically named because they themselves tend to be.. slippery.  It can be hard to distinguish between them and legitimate arguments that appear very similar."
scotus,34ec5x,Droviin,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:37:58 2015 UTC,"The combining of conditionals is fine; it's not a fallacy.    Slippery slopes are a fallacy because the assumption of a conditional used in an argument only appears warranted. In other words, the slippery slope doesn't need a stopping point; rather the slippery slope needs explain why each step in the slope make sense.      So, why should we assume that allowing gay marriage would do anything to allow polyamorous marriage?    The proper response is that the question relies on a false conditional, so there is no reason to entertain the question."
scotus,34ec5x,OptionK,5,Thu Apr 30 21:30:30 2015 UTC,"Well Alito or Scalia actually say that same-sex marriage redefines the rules because it isn't how marriage is traditionally viewed, just like a 4-way polyamourous marriage isn't how we view a traditional marriage.    The difference is that polygamous marriages raise legitimate concerns that gay marriages do not. Those provide at least an arguably rational basis for not allowing them. Not such rational basis exists for not allowing gay marriages."
scotus,34ec5x,bac5665,3,Thu Apr 30 14:22:06 2015 UTC,"It's also possible that, 100 years from now, we'll legalize polygamous marriage.  If we can find a way to solve the consent issue, I see no reason why polygamy can't be a thing.  Consenting adults can and should do what they like.    Right now, it's clear that the consent issues are enough that we're not ready.  But there's no reason to think that cannot change."

scotus,34ec5x,shanedoth,5,Thu Apr 30 15:53:49 2015 UTC,"Well, marriage currently is a bilateral, exclusive contract. Let's say that we decide that the ""exclusivity"" part of marriage is no longer required, and that there is no longer a restriction on a person who is already married who wants to marry another.   Does existing spouse have to consent? Does proposed new spouse have to consent? Can first spouse ever revoke consent and force a divorce between the shared spouse and the second-in-time spouse? Can the second spouse ever force a divorce between the original couple? What if consent is fraudulently obtained? What effect will that have on the first contract or the second contract? What effect would a second marriage have on existing marital property? Does the original spouse have ownership diluted? Will the second spouse always be ""junior"" to the original spouse, the same way we treat second mortgages?   It'd be messy and unprecedented.  Changing the ""bilateral"" property of marriage contracts gets even more complicated.    Does the addition of a new spouse require unanimous consent of all existing spouses? Does divorce require unanimous consent, or does a single spouse have the power to expel another? Will there be a mechanism for cleaving the marriage into two multiparty groups, or will all divorces only expel one person at a time, leaving them free to marry each other again? How will child custody work in these divorce situations, with each permutation of consenting/nonconsenting participants of the divorce?   Throw in children, deaths, etc., and the whole situation becomes far more complex than any bilateral marriage could be.  Polygamy is arguably incompatible with equality of legal rights. Most polygamist societies had a man of the household who held all the powers of consent to marry or divorce, with no power reserved for the women."
scotus,34ec5x,Law_Student,2,Thu Apr 30 19:57:34 2015 UTC,"My thoughts, in order -   Yes, marriage is after all a contract and contracts require consent from all parties to create or change.  Yes, same reasoning.  I don't see one person being able to force out another as being reasonable.  I do see any individual having the right to leave the union though if they wish.  The other individuals remaining could continue the union minus a member or break it apart as they wished, as that would be a matter between them.  If you obtain consent for a contract by fraud or coercion then the contract becomes unenforceable against any of the parties who were the victims of the fraud or coercion.  I don't really see a need to do anything special for multiple marriages in that regard, other than casting a wary eye at members of cloistered religious communities who may be particularly subject to coerced marriages.  Why would there need to be a mechanism to divide marriages up into equal groups when you already have mechanisms to dissolve and reform them?  They seem functionally equivalent.  I don't see child custody having anything to do with who consents to the divorce, seeing as how we handle it just fine now in all the circumstances where only one partner wishes to divorce in a normal marriage and the other doesn't."
scotus,34ec5x,shanedoth,5,Thu Apr 30 20:37:02 2015 UTC,"Well, here's a more concrete example. Take a multilateral marriage between A, B, C, and D. After a time, irreconcilable differences arise between A and D. Neither wants to leave B & C, and neither B nor C want anyone to leave the marriage. But A no longer wants to be married to D, and D no longer wants to be married to A. Do they just have to play consent chicken to see who stays? Or would two people, neither of whom want to be married to the other, have to stay married in order to stay married to B & C?  There are a lot of untenable equilibria in multilateral relationships, which is why unanimous consent breaks down in partnership/LLC/corporate contexts. Dissolution of partnerships can get messy. And dissolution of corporations, where majority vote controls, might be a little bit cleaner, although it doesn't quite strike people the right way for simple majority rules to be able to control a marriage relationship.  And again, custody and parental rights over children born to a marriage would have to be divided as well. It just complicates things when you can't just rescind a contract (e.g., for fraud or duress) when a third party has relied on the existence of that contract."
scotus,34ec5x,Law_Student,2,Thu Apr 30 21:35:52 2015 UTC,"I agree that being in any kind of chaining situation where A wants to be married to B but not C and B wants to be married to A and C and C wants to be married to B but not A is complicated, whether it's setting up something new or dissolving something old into that new format.  But then the same thing is a mess in business law we already have, and we don't disallow people from forming partnerships for that reason.  We just deal with the complexities as they come as best we can.  What's the problem with not enforcing a contract against anyone victimized by fraud or duress in this situation?"
scotus,34ec5x,JaronK,2,Thu Apr 30 21:41:54 2015 UTC,"In current polyamorous situations, A & D break up, becoming metamores (lovers of their lovers).  They remain with B & C as before.  I don't see how this is terribly different from current business law, but then again I'm coming at this from a different angle compared to most here... I'm polyamorous and have seen these situations constantly, but I'm not sure of the current legal frameworks."
scotus,34ec5x,LaughingIshikawa,1 point,Fri May 1 00:09:11 2015 UTC,"See this is where I expected someone to go with it, as I think these are much thornier questions that will need consideration.  Very nicely organized too, I'm totally saving this for future reference!  Incidentally, can I cross post this to a different sub-reddit?  I assume this was more rhetorical than anything, but I hope no one minds if I pontificate on possible answers to some of these points:   Does existing spouse have to consent?   I think if you have assume that the new marriage will confer rights to shared property, or otherwise substantially affect the legal rights or status of the existing spouse you have to say their consent is required.  In order to not require consent you'd have to get rid of assumptions of joint property ownership and the like - and although that's certainly possible, it's a bit more extensive of a change.   Does proposed new spouse have to consent?   Clearly in any case the new spouse's consent is required as much as we require consent of anyone entering into a contract.   Can first spouse ever revoke consent and force a divorce between the shared spouse and the second-in-time spouse?   Lets name some hypothetical people, or this is going to get confusing.  Alice is married to Bob.  Bob marries Carol.  Later Alice revokes consent and forces Bob to divorce Carol.  Bob doesn't agree, and promptly divorces Alice and re-marries Carol.  I don't think it's especially practical to allow people to eject others from the marriage unless there's unanimous consent from all other parties - rather we'll pretty much have to allow people to simply remove themselves.  In the case of 4 people who wish to split into 2 marriages of 2 people each (and other similar circumstances) You might treat the two people who wish to leave as one legal entity for divorce proceedings, or you may let each person leave individually and immediately re-marry each other - which ever is easier.   Can the second spouse ever force a divorce between the original couple?   See above   What if consent is fraudulently obtained? What effect will that have on the first contract or the second contract?   It would only inviolate the contract(s) for which consent was fraudulently obtained, I suppose.  Going back to our hypothetical people, I would imagine the most complicated scenario would be if Alice marries Bob, and Bob then marries Carol.  Later it is discovered that Bob fraudulently acquired Alice's consent to the first marriage.  As long as whatever fraud we're talking about doesn't concern the second marriage, in a bilateral system Bob and Carol's marriage is still valid.  The requirement for Alice to consent to their marriage expires when Alice and Bob's marriage does, so I'm not sure that's an issue.   What effect would a second marriage have on existing marital property? Does the original spouse have ownership diluted?   If there's shared property, then yes - one of the main reasons you would require their consent.   Will the second spouse always be ""junior"" to the original spouse, the same way we treat second mortgages?   Not inherently - I imagine they would be equal, much in the way that new partners entering into an existing partnership in the business context are equal in status.  People could sign some kind of pre-nup to override this, if they so desire.  If you also removing the ""bilateral property:   Does the addition of a new spouse require unanimous consent of all existing spouses?   Yes, because you're assuming each person is also marrying the other, rather than in the bilateral case.  (Where Alice and Bob can be married while Bob and Carol are married.. without Alice and Carol necessarily being married.)   Does divorce require unanimous consent, or does a single spouse have the power to expel another?   Each person always has the power to leave.  The unanimous consent of all other parties is required to forcible expel one or more members - because it's essentially equivalent to all other parties leaving and forming a new marriage.   Will there be a mechanism for cleaving the marriage into two multiparty groups, or will all divorces only expel one person at a time, leaving them free to marry each other again?   Possibly - see above.  Fundamentally these two options seem the same to me, so it's more about which one is more practical.   How will child custody work in these divorce situations, with each permutation of consenting/nonconsenting participants of the divorce?   Are parents currently treated differently in terms of child custody with regard to their consent to the divorce?  (Legit question, I'm not that familiar with the current laws.)  I would assume that all parties retain their parental rights until they surrender them or the court finds reason to revoke them.  This could get messy if a child ends up with 20 parents... although I suspect that would be an extreme case.  However, how would the court decide this if a woman successively married 20 different men?  Maybe we should determine biological parents and/or only assign parental rights at birth?  There's a couple different ways to make sure this doesn't run out of control.  Death simply forcibly removes one person from all marriages they may be involved in, much as it does now.  In the Alice - Bob - Carol bilateral example it's complicated because Alice and Carol don't jointly own the property except through Bob - but I imagine there would be a legal proceeding much like divorce to divide the property. If you want a really thorny question: what if Alice, Carol, and Danielle are all married to Bob, but Danielle is also married to Eric.  How is property divided if Bob dies?  Specifically, does Eric get a share?  I suspect not.   Polygamy is arguably incompatible with equality of legal rights.   Agreed.  ...Well, sort of - Polygamy, technically, is the practice of having multiple spouses, which doesn't necessarily dictate that sort of hub and spoke structure, regardless of it's current cultural associations.  However, any system that systematically enforces either Polygyny (multiple wives) or Polyandry (multiple husbands) is not morally - or legally - justifiable by definition."
scotus,34ec5x,bac5665,8,Thu Apr 30 22:19:35 2015 UTC,"Communities that practice polygamy in the US today, tend to be places where the women don't have a lot of say in their marriages, often with huge age discrepancies.  The women are, sometimes, forced into marriages they don't want with men they don't know, for the sexual pleasure of the man.    These are not universal, but they are the dangers of polygamy in regards to consent, with the way it tends to be practiced."
scotus,34ec5x,LaughingIshikawa,7,Thu Apr 30 16:03:29 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I guess that was a good question, because that's not at all the issue that I assumed you were talking about.  I appreciate the clarification.  I think I would talk about being coerced personally, but that's a nit-picky distinction.  In any case I fail to see how this makes a substantial legal difference - surely people are just as vulnerable to being coerced or forced into traditional marriages, right?  I think to deny plural marriages based on this premise you'd have to show that there's something structural about plural marriages that makes coercion a lot more likely, and I'm not sure there's evidence for that."
scotus,34ec5x,cynest,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:46:44 2015 UTC,I suspect that the counter argument is that monogamous marriage limits that possibility since it lowers the number of people with the influence to force such a marriage.

I was thinking specifically of arranged marriages, (although to be fair I didn't specify) so I'm not sure that holds up.  The coercion doesn't have to come from someone actually involved in the marriage   Another argument would be that polygamy is much harder to untangle if and when it does go bad.   I don't buy that either, but I can see why others might - you can say that it makes for somewhat more complicated divorce proceedings, but I think that the threat of complicated divorce proceedings aren't high on an abuser's list of potential threats.  Loss of economic support, loss of access to children, loss of social status - all of these are equally possible in monogamous and polygamous marriages."
scotus,34ec5x,JaronK,2,Fri May 1 00:02:45 2015 UTC,"The thing is, the cultures that practiced that sort of polygamy do the same thing when they're monogamous.  So that doesn't seem relevant.

scotus,34ec5x,superdago,5,Thu Apr 30 15:06:48 2015 UTC,"I've never viewed the issue with polygamy as being one of consent. I think the much bigger issue relates to something like power of attorney. If I become incapacitated, my wife, by virtue of being my wife, is legally allowed to make medical decisions on my behalf. Additionally, when I have kids, both my wife and I will have equal rights to child rearing decisions.  If a man with 2 wives becomes incapacitated, who gets the final say if the 2 women disagree on a course of action? Does the older wife win out? The first wife? What if the second wife, who is not the biological parent of the child, wishes to pick the child up from school? Or make a medical decision for the child? Can they? Should they?  Right now, our entire system is set up so that there are 2 co-equal parties who are, for the most part, biologically connected to their children. At the very least, our adoption system is set up to have a maximum of 2 legal guardians at any one time. Allowing gays to marry does nothing to change the overall structure or systems in place. Allowing for polygamy introduces an entirely new variable that is not accounted for by schools, hospitals, probate court systems, divorce laws, etc.   Further, it is unlikely that any laws could be drafted to adequately account for several people being married in any combination of number, gender, or family structure.   Contrast that with gay marriage where no court system, hospital procedure, etc. needs to be changed. The man will have one person lawfully allowed to make medical decisions. The child will have only 2 guardians."

I think the issues are smaller than people think they are - although of course compared to gay marriage it would cause substantially more legal disruption.  However, my question is: is that a viable reason for the court not to rule in favor of something?  Can they essentially say ""We can't allow it because it would be too difficult?""  I would think that even if that was an underlying motivation, they would have to find another justification."

scotus,34ec5x,urnbabyurn,5,Thu Apr 30 20:38:46 2015 UTC,"But with a 4-way marriage, the state can easily state an interest in not providing such contracts.  For same sex marriages, the plaintiffs have generally done a piss poor job at claiming a state interest.  In fact, they tend to argue against their own claims.  They say the state interest is in promoting child rearing.  But then bans on gay marriages would indeed make it harder, under that argument, for gay couples raising adopted children.   I believe Posner stated this quite nice in his ruling when it was in front of his court."
scotus,34ec5x,MYGODWHATHAVEIDONE,2,Thu Apr 30 14:48:35 2015 UTC,"This is not a convincing argument.  Any marriage, whether between two people or multiple people can involve concerns about consent and coercion.  Arranged marriages still happen.  There's an a priori reason to assume that, in the abstract, polyamorous relationships are inherently more problematic in terms of consent and coercion than traditional marriages.   If there's a divorce from the second wife, does that mean the fourth wife has access to the child of the second wife?   This argument is premised on the idea that marriage is a social institution that is largely about child rearing, which is one of the principal conservative arguments against gay marriage.  If the state can decide not to issue marriage licenses on the rationale that marriage is about child rearing, then gay marriage could be denied just as polyamorous marriage could be denied.   There are issues around who is it that makes the medical decisions, you know, in the time of crisis. I assume there'd be lots of family disruption issues…   Polyamory is more complex than monogamy, but this doesn't make medical decisions a differentiating factor from gay marriage.  One of the principal concerns of gay couples is that their lifelong partners do not have legal rights for visitation and medical decisions.  One could make the same argument for poly arrangements, where the lifelong third or fourth in the relationship could be denied visitation and medical decisionmaking rights.  If the state can deny one, there's no logical reason it can't deny the other.   The state has an interest in preventing polygamous marriages. With gay marriage, the state does not as it doesn't redefine the rules of a marriage contract.   Gay marriage does alter the marriage contract, and it complicates a very large body of existing family law.  Family law is built on the assumption that marriage involves a man and a woman, and there are numerous protections and obligations given to one gender or the other.  There are a number of default presumptions built into child custody and divorce settlements (e.g. alimony) that are premised on assumptions about the genders involved.  Gay marriages, in which both members of the marriage are of the same gender, are going to make application of the rules and operating assumptions about who gets protections, obligations, children, alimony and other issues significantly different.  Gay marriages, because there is no gender difference within the marriage that may require protections, may undermine the protections that have been granted to women in traditional marriages.  Insofar as the state has an interest in protecting children and protecting women, the state could be said to have an interest in denying licenses for gay marriage, just as it could be said to have an interest in denying licenses for poly marriages."

Polyagamy, which may or may not be something you consider ok, does not follow because it creates clear problems for defining that contract.

Marraige is a contract between two people.  The contract law behind this goes deep and would have to be worked out anew for plural marraige.  Let's deal with just one of these cases: survivorship.  Our laws deal with survivorship in a marraige assuming 1survivor.  A person can elect when starting social security to have dual survivorship so the SS is paid at a lower rate but is paid for the life of the person and the spouse.    With plural marriage I could marry perhaps a woman and her daughter, claim SS with survivorship and expect both them to receive my check after I die for the length of both lives.    This is a loophole that would have to be addressed; perhaps with a step down table reducing the amount further for each additional spouse, but whatever the answer, there is a bigger change of law required to adjudicate the variations possible with plural marraige."
scotus,34ec5x,gnothi_seauton,3,Fri May 1 00:08:37 2015 UTC,"The definition of marriage is arbitrary.  How many people of whatever gender who mutually consent to a commitment does not matter.  The state does not regulate friendships as people can freely associate.  The question is:  Why is the state justified in regulating the number and gender of people in the status they confer?  The justifications for their definition may be different.  Even the justifications are somewhat arbitrary.  Take polygyny in Lesotho, I believe.  Marrying additional wives was an economic choice which gave you a right to work two additional fields.   Also, lacking hotels, one person asked about the practice stated that it provided a place for guests to stay when people visited.  Take polyandry in Nepal.  Brothers married one wife which allowed property to stay in and be worked by one family.  You do not get a rational relationship between any two practices because they are embedded in a web of other practices.  Is marriage about childrearing, providing for the worship of the ancestors, or taking care of the elderly?  Is it founded on mutual affection, a union of surnames, an alliance of tribes, or mutual economic support?    Both sides have weak arguments.  Take the consent and coercion argument against polyamory.  The Soviets when they defined marriage were very concerned about women being compelled to marry rich men.  So, they defined marriage as one founded on mutual affection for the purpose of providing future socialists.  The American solution to coercion has been more money (i.e. financial independence.)  So, Bonauto's answer that four lawyers would have trouble consenting and there might be coercion calls into question whether financial independence is a meaningful way to untangle that knot.    Neither side seems to want to acknowledge a practice with deep historical roots which fundamentally redefined marriage:  divorce.  Both their arguments ignore that because they both want us to ""think of the children."""
scotus,34ec5x,pjlhjr,3,Thu Apr 30 15:56:49 2015 UTC,"First as Ms. Bonauto and others in this thread have noted, the states have a compelling interest to regulate marriages as between two people because of the horde of practical issues that arise by further modifying the definition of marriage. From a logistical standpoint, expanding the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples simply requires changing the language in marriage statues to be gender neutral. Same-sex marriage would still involve two people, and it does not require the courts to revisit decades of marriage law. Whereas to include polygamous marriage, the courts would have to invent new standards on many areas, including property, custodial and medical laws, just to name a few. The Court allowing polygamous marriage would be over stepping its judicial powers and venturing into the area of legislating how to regulate marriages.  Furthermore for Question 1 to go in favor a gay rights advocates, the justices will have to rule that laws that traditional marriage laws discriminate against a class of people, namely gay people. Laws against interracial marriages have similarly been struck down by this logic. So for these laws to be discriminatory towards people in polygamous relationships, those people would have to be considered a class of people uniquely predisposed to be attracted to multiple people. Whereas being gay or being a certain race is not a choice, the same probably could not be held for people in a polygamous relationship. Most people are probably guilty of having some (at least superficial) attraction to someone who is not their partner. And no single group of people is more likely than any other to harbor deep connections with multiple people.   So because of the state's compelling interest in regulating marriage and the lack of evidence of discrimination against a certain class of people, state laws can and do simply draw the line and say you can only have one spouse."
scotus,34ec5x,infinitum17,3,Thu Apr 30 19:20:52 2015 UTC,"This sounds like the best argument that I've heard against plural marriage, but it essentially boils down to, ""it's complicated, so we shouldn't do it."" Well, corporate contracts are complicated, too, but we allow plural-party contracts. What is plural marriage but a plural-party contract? The job of the state would simply be to honor the specifics of the contract that the parties enter into, and like, confer tax benefits. That's it.  I'll admit that polyamorous people as a distinct class are more iffy than gay people. But research is starting to understand and define it better, and it's looking like some people tend towards falling in love with multiple people more than others. And even with gay people, there's a spectrum."
scotus,34ec5x,pjlhjr,2,Thu Apr 30 23:47:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, I definitely agree that polygamous marriages could be recognized by the law, as we with contract law. Maybe one day there will be a shift to support it, as has happen with gay marriage. But as I said above, the transformation would be too radical to comfortably fit within current laws. The question before the court when Alito gave his question was basically ""Who gets to decide the marriage question?"" For polygamous marriages, I believe the answer would be that the decision falls to state legislatures to define.  Also if you have any of it saved, I would love to see the research that your citing in your second paragraph."

Same-sex marriage would still involve two people, and it does not require the courts to revisit decades of marriage law.    You realize that the decades centuries of marriage law is premised on there being two different genders in the marriage, and that the protections for women and children built into current marriage and family law are founded on the idea that different genders have different roles in marriage and child-rearing, right?  Stripping marriage and family law of all distinctions between gender would erase decades and decades of feminist efforts to protect women.  The courts and legislatures would absolutely have to revisit the majority of marriage law.   So for these laws to be discriminatory towards people in polygamous relationships, those people would have to be considered a class of people uniquely predisposed to be attracted to multiple people.   There's plenty of scientific and anthropological evidence to support the claim that humans in general are not naturally monogamous.  I'd venture to say that the evidence is probably stronger than the evidence for a genetic predisposition towards homosexuality."
scotus,34ec5x,pjlhjr,2,Thu Apr 30 22:51:41 2015 UTC,"What is marriage from the government's point of view? Special rights and privileges given by 1,138 statutory provisions to a set of people to encourage them to support each other and their family. Looking down that list, a vast majority of those provision do not apply to a partner of specific gender, but to each spouse equally. Any of the few privileges that do specify gender need not apply to gay marriage (and of course those determinations will need to be made by courts), but as the lack of lawsuits in states that have adopted gay marriages shows, this is not a significant issue.   Additionally just because some provisions don't apply to gay marriages, doesn't mean laws automatically go off the books for those provisions where legislatures have specified men or women. Furthermore, each marriage provision stands alone, so the applicability of one is not dependent on the existence of any other. If a couple doesn't have children that doesn't mean that they suddenly lose hospital visitation rights.  As for your second point, I would agree that there is significant evidence that humans are probably not naturally monogamous, but that is why I said people desiring a polygamous relationship could not be considered a class of people that are being discriminated. You can't claim to be protecting a special class of people when everyone would fall within that class of people. States have the right to decide to whom to extend those special privileges and so far none have decided to include polygamous couples."

These rights were a key issue in the debate over federal recognition of same-sex marriage. Under the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), the federal government was prohibited from recognizing same-sex couples who were lawfully married under the laws of their state. The conflict between this definition and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution led the U.S. Supreme Court to rule DOMA unconstitutional on June 26, 2013, in the case of United States v.

If most provisions are specific obligations or rights of each individual spouse (not the spouses as a unit of two), then they can apply to two men or three men.   just because some provisions don't apply to gay marriages, doesn't mean laws automatically go off the books for those provisions where legislatures have specified men or women   It will open all gender-specific marriage and family law up to gender discrimination lawsuits.  If a man divorcing a man doesn't have to undertake the same obligations as a man divorcing a woman, and if a woman being divorced by a woman does not receive the same protections as a woman being divorced by a man, then marriage and family law will be subject to unceasing Equal Protection / gender discrimination lawsuits.  /r/MensRights has already been making this same case as a way of arguing against gendered alimony and custody protections that feminists fought for.   You can't claim to be protecting a special class of people when everyone would fall within that class of people. States have the right to decide to whom to extend those special privileges and so far none have decided to include polygamous couples.   Utah would have joined the Union allowing polygamous couples, and viewed polygamy as a central tenet of the LDS religion.  The United States engaged in a limited ""war"" with the Utah Territory in 1857–1858.  This conflict was based on the Republican Party's 1856 election promise to rid the territories of ""those twin relics of barbarism: polygamy and slavery.""  In 1862 Congress passed an anti-bigamy act, and in 1863 a writ was enforced on Brigham Young for violation of the Suppression of Polygamy Act.  Only after the LDS gave up polygamy as essential dogma in 1980 was Utah able to become a state (1896).  Mostly the same set of politicians who signed into law the Morill Anti-Bigamy Act (including Lincoln) were those that drafted the Fourteenth Amendment.  This means that those who wrote and passed the Fourteenth Amendment saw no problem restricting the ability of states to issue marriage licenses to groups that otherwise might receive constitutional protection (First Amendment freedom of religion).  There is really no constitutional basis to force a state to issue non-traditional marriage licenses, and the clear practice and understanding at the time of the Utah War and at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was passed is in fact the opposite: the federal government was acting constitutionally when it suppressed the issuance of non-traditional marriage licenses.  If federal statutes prohibiting the issuance of marriage licenses to gay couples can be overturned on the basis of the constitution, then statutes prohibiting the state from licensing bigamous/polyamorous marriages can also be overturned.  In my view, I do not think there is a solid constitutional basis for overturning restrictions on the issuance of marriage licenses.  I think the expansion of marriage to include same-sex marriage ought to be done democratically, either by referendum or by our elected representatives, not by judicial fiat. Several states have already passed statutes or held referenda granting same-sex marriage licenses without needing a court ruling to do so: Delaware, DC, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.  In every other case, it has been through judicial fiat at the state or federal level, in many cases overruling not just existing statute but also overruling direct referenda."
scotus,34ec5x,LaughingIshikawa,3,Fri May 1 05:41:47 2015 UTC,"I've spent a little while jumping between subs to see the different perspectives on this, and also trying to untangle what's being argued.  This is what I ultimately understand is being conveyed, in less legal terminology.  I'm not any kind of law student, so please tell me if I get anything wrong.  Justice: If people have a fundamental right to marry, as you claim, then would there be any reason to deny 2 men and 2 women who want to all marry each other?  Lawyer: I believe so.  The fundamental right of to marry has to be balanced against any legitimate reasons the state might have to disallow such marriages.  States can claim that there are substantial questions of consent, coercion, (and more practical issues such as who makes decisions in terms of emergency medical care) when the question is about marriages between multiple people.  The gender of the couple does not cause any similar disruptions, therefore the state should not be able to regulate based on gender.  So people would have a fundamental right to marry multiple people, but the states would also have grounds to bar them from doing so.  It would have to be a question decided separately.  Edit: To be fair other commenters in this thread have said essentially the same thing, but simply haven't elaborated as much as I have.  I'm hoping this makes it clearer for those less familiar with any legal precedent(s)."

But it does strike me as an easier case for the state to defend because it does not discriminate as to any recognized protected class in polygamous marriages; it just doesn't allow them at all. Wouldn't it be sufficient rational basis for the state to simply argue that they do not believe such relationships to be sufficiently reliably sustainable, and that it is not equipped to deal with the created legal relationships or tax consequences?"

scotus,34ec5x,OFF_THE_DEEP_END,2,Fri May 1 04:06:47 2015 UTC,"So let's say hypothetically, states vote on their respective definition of marriage, and then some states allow only gay marriage, and some states also allow polygamous, and some just man and woman...  This is supposed to be a reflection of the will of the people in each state. Going to SCOTUS is an attempt to make all people in the nation have a baseline right. So how does SCOTUS pick the baseline? Is it just gay and lesbians who have a right? The argument is that all people have the freedom to choose to whom they make a lifetime commitment. If that's the case, then marriage is no longer voted upon by the people and it's just mandated by federal government.  Essentially, this boils down to can the federal government take that power to legislate marriages from the states. Each and every state would lose some of its authority, and the federal government would collect that power from them.  That taking of authority was considered the right thing to do in cases where states outlawed restrictions on marriages between people of different races. And now the question is about restrictions on the sex of the bride and groom.  Ultimately, the responsibility of SCOTUS is to NOT divide the nation up and weaken it. What draws everyone together on marriage? What right is there that all people have regardless? There is the right that people have the freedom of choice. People can choose to marry, it's not a mandate. And people can choose to commit to whomever. If that's the case, then to deny the benefits of marriage to homosexuals is really not fair and it's discriminatory. And it's just as much a discrimination to deny it to polygamous groups."

If Justice Ginsburg is right, then that points out a serious flaw in the ""marriages as law"" argument, namely that it's inconsistent with the court's precedent.

Sotomayor's voice was not working well for last week's oral arguments (I only listened to the Raisins case so far). I wonder if she'll be loud and prominent tomorrow or if it'll get in her way. Kennedy mumbles. But if he has anything to ask, Roberts will be like ""EVERYBODY SHUT UP AND LET KENNEDY ASK HIS QUESTION."" He did that in the Raisins case and in at least a few other cases. Roberts will defend Kennedy to the death! Kennedy's questions are almost always on a problem he has if he rules in the favor of the person arguing. He's more transparent in that way, I guess, though sometimes people have a hard time figuring out how he's going to rule. Scalia aims for 3-5 jokes per case and usually gets the audience laughing at least half the time. He's loud in controversial cases and quiet as a mouse in the boring stuff. Alito has a nasally voice and he often sounds like the impostor on the court. Alito's almost assuredly going to vote for an affirmation of the 6th circuit tomorrow. Of the Windsor case, he wrote the most detailed explanation as to why gay marriage bans should stay in place. Clarence Thomas is kind of a dick. I've never heard him utter a word during oral argument, but for Naverette v. California, he read his opinion. The case was about how someone can call in a tip that someone is driving funny and that's enough to pull someone over (even though the police tailed him for a long period of time and they were driving just fine). Anyhow, he got to the part where he read the facts of the case where the police officers found weed in the car. Thomas said ""Well, they shouldn't have done that"" in a jokingly way, as if to imply that he was passing judgment on their behavior and not simply interpreting the law. Dude loses a Supreme Court case by one vote and Thomas is putting him down. Some of these public defenders who take the stand... yeesh! They sound like they are giving a speech naked while running on a treadmill. Rodriguez may have won his case but it certainly wasn't due to oral argument. If you are listening for the first time, follow along with the transcript when it gets published (likely on the same day). Some of these justices are unintelligible (Ginsburg, Kennedy).   Edited for accuracy."

The tip was found reliable for a number of reasons. Also I like how you downplay the weed. They found 30 pounds. Seems like you just don't like J. Thomas, which is totally fine.  The court relied on two propositions: 1) the anonymous caller claimed eyewitness knowledge, reported the incident soon after being run off the road (police found the vehicle 19 miles away from the reported location 18 minutes after the 911 call). Contemporaneous report has long been treated as especially reliable, as indicated by the present sense impression and excited utterance exceptions to hearsay.   2) The caller was not considered anonymous, as they used the 911 system and such calls can be recorded, and the police can verify important information such as the caller's phone number and location, so a reasonable officer could conclude that a false tipster would ""think twice"" before using such a system.  Furthermore, the lower court upheld the stop applying the J.L. danger exception; contemporaneous report of drunken/erratic driving on a public roadway, and officers corroborated significant details, like a detailed description of the vehicle and its location."

The elements remained essentially the same (not anonymous, drunk driving posing a danger, contemporaneous experience).   still have it wrong.   Incorrect. The higher court doesn't think it was anonymous - that is what matters. Anything else on the rest of my post? My facts were correct, I didn't call it out like you have a conspiracy - just that you weren't right.    Thomas was being a dick in his announcement, in my opinion.

But to paint it as    The case was about how someone can anonymously call in a tip that someone is driving funny and that's enough to pull someone over    is blatant misinformation, since that is not what was considered.

scotus,340tg7,The_Jackson_3,3,Thu Apr 30 02:27:25 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'm changing my stance. You are correct, I just was unhappy with your phrasing. I think it is far wrong to say that ""it was considered not to be anonymous."" The Supreme Court trumped what the police have said, but the police did think it was anonymous. That's the whole point to the case: even if you are giving a tip in an anonymous way, you are still, by the court's opinion, acknowledging that the police likely have the technology to trace you anyways. The dissent also does not believe that. The lower courts and police may contest this. You are right that I should have added some qualifier there and I will edit my post as such, but the phrasing you used is not correct as well."
scotus,340tg7,desantoos,3,Thu Apr 30 13:07:14 2015 UTC,"You are right - I should have said the court considered it not to be anonymous to be more accurate, rather than just a blanket statement regarding anonymity at all levels.

When he makes a public appearance in front of a group of students, he'll say, ""You can ask me any questions, as long as they're not about the law."" This from a Supreme Court justice. Some people suspect he actually doesn't know very much about the law at all, hence the silence.

I just don't see what the video would add to the process outside of giving the audience members an avenue to disrupt the proceedings and have it nationally broadcast.  Audio is released, first-hand viewing is permitted, what do cameras add to transparency? The oral arguments are only nominally important to the final decision but it seems like people want to assign some huge value to the comments made there.  No verdict will be reached at the end of the oral arguments and until the opinion is published all the justices are free to change their views while the opinion is written.  I'm just not sold that we need it and I think that making a big deal about the lack of cameras or the perceived need of cameras is a non-starter."

That is factually true, but the nuances and implications are totally different from saying that something like the Tea Party is conservative.

scotus,31meml,FoxyBrownMcCloud,4,Mon Apr 6 14:10:42 2015 UTC,"I mean don't take my word for it. I'm reading the opinion and it's a bit more in-depth as with anything concerning law.  ""Before closing, let’s put one trending, but erroneous, sound bite to rest.   Heien argued that because the common-law maxim “ignorance of the law is no excuse” applies to private citizens who break the law, it should also be applied to police here. Tweeters are now claiming that today’s ruling means the maxim applies to everyone except the police. That not only ignores the very different contexts (criminal law breaking versus justifications for stopping suspected law-breakers), but it’s wrong also in its premise. In fact, the Court long ago ruled that a reasonable “ignorance of the law” can be a defense to prosecution. In Lambert v. California (1957), the Court vacated a criminal conviction because the law at issue could not be reasonably known to the citizenry. This ruling still finds application today, albeit rarely. It seems that the Court may have (even if not consciously) reinvigorated the Lambert concept today at page 12, where it indicated that “the government cannot impose criminal liability based on a mistaken understanding of the law.” If read broadly, this statement could represent a sea change in the modern understanding of Lambert – a decision that Justice Frankfurter called, in dissent, “a derelict on the waters of the law.” But it seems clear that the Court today meant “on [its own] misunderstanding of the law,” not a private citizen’s.  Meanwhile, police who break the law are still subject to the usual maxim: ignorance of the law will not excuse their lawbreaking any more than anyone else’s. But here, police are trying to implement the Fourth Amendment, not break the law. There is of course some tension between the idea that “the law is definite and knowable” versus an officer’s “reasonable” legal mistake. But the Court held today only that when police officers reasonably understand others to have broken the law, they may briefly stop them to investigate without violating the Fourth Amendment. Absent a shift in societal standards for law enforcement – and recently we are witnessing at least a re-examination — this ruling seems unsurprising."""

Essentially, Roberts stated you can change your argument next time. I thought the SG would go all-in because if he said it was likely unconstitutional coercion, it could have persuaded Kennedy heavily, and if the Government wins here its end of story. I figured in the administration's mind, the statute falls apart and theres not much of a backup plan if petitioner wins, so I didn't consider the next round of this @SCOTUS. Good point though, since something could be figured out to save the statute even if petitioner wins."

scotus,2y7d0g,hitbyacar1,6,Sat Mar 7 02:45:48 2015 UTC,"I waiver on this issue, but most of the time, I'm alright with the status quo. If we want the status quo to change, we should always ask, ""How is the change beneficial?"" I only hear one reason being thrown out there - transparency. (Obviously, if there's another reason that I'm missing, please mention it.) However, I think this fails under scrutiny.  Many commenters note an apparent absurdity in the Court's policy. ""All of the information is already out there!"" We get transcripts and audio of oral arguments. Rather than undermining the status quo, this undermines the transparency rationale. What is more transparent about having cameras versus having transcripts/audio?  I think there is something, but it's not pretty. I was finally able to attend the Supreme Court for the first time last year. It was only for opinions, not an argument; nevertheless, I did realize that there are unique qualities of the experience.  1) The general DC grandeur is reflected in the design of the courtroom.  2) Security is annoying, but probably necessary in an open setting where the general public outnumbers the Court members and Court officials several-fold.  3) There is a bit of ceremony and a methodical pace to business. For interested parties waiting on opinions, there is a moment of incredible anticipation (I am not lying when I say that my heart skipped a beat when I thought we might get a really big opinion).   4) The Justices are people with mannerisms. For a time, one justice had kicked back in his chair, hands behind his head, while other business was being conducted. Was he checked out, because his attention wasn't needed for this part of the process? Was he deep in thought about something else? Who knows. I'm bad at interpreting body language.  Anyway, the first three items pretty clearly don't give us anything meaningful in terms of transparency. Even if you construct an argument that there is something in these items (cue Dahlia Lithwick writing an article claiming that SCOTUS defers to government security because that issue affects them), putting cameras in for regular Court business is overkill. The first two items could easily be shared with a ""get to know the Court"" video which just shows off the courtroom and a ""what to expect when visiting"" video which describes the security procedures and the decorum expected of the audience. You can get a feel for the methodical pace through audio, and I really don't know why anyone would argue that my schoolgirlish anticipation is an important element of government transparency.  Thus, we're left with the mannerisms of the Justices. I will freely admit that there is information here, but it's ridiculously hard to make good sense of. Perhaps I'm committing the typical mind fallacy, but I'm personally really bad at interpreting body language and facial expressions. I've been close friends with people who feel as though they're constantly misinterpreted. One individual said that when she's working intently on something, people often interpret her facial expression as being mad. They'll ask her if something is wrong. ""It's just my face! I can't help it!""  Historically, I always recall stories of when presidential debates moved from radio to television. I've never heard someone make an impassioned defense of all the good things that televised debates gave us. I've personally heard far too many superficial and completely vapid comments concerning the visuals provided in a debate. (Nevertheless, I think it's far more likely that someone could make a good argument for televised presidential debates than televised SCOTUS business.)  tl;dr Everyone agrees that putting cameras in the Court would be technologically easy. It's rhetorically easy to identify ""technologically easy"" with ""beneficial"". I haven't heard very good arguments for why there would be strong benefits."

I can't recall a time that it was taken severely out of context.  Supreme court oral arguments don't have much 'entertainment value' to begin with.  The only time that the national media covers it is when important decisions are handed down and perhaps when certiorari is granted in big cases.  Still, even if video was misused, correct that misinformation with good information.  If the worry is about misusing it on current issues, just delay the release of video to 6 months after the decision is issued.  It has educational value, and the fear of bad speech shouldn't be the reason to limit the public's access to one of the most important institutions in our government."

I listen to numerous podcasts and generally go out of my way to stay abreast in the happenings at the court, but most Americans do not and can not.  What I'd argue is that having live feeds and video footage would make the court:   Less mysterious to most Americans More likely to show up on the local news More accessible to people who do not want to go the extra mile to simply know how the Constitution is being challenged and interpreted by our country's highest court.   I'm not delusional. I understand that simply airing these proceedings will not make the SCOTUS proceedings comprehensible or more interesting, but they will make it more visible, and this has merit in and of itself.  Can you seriously argue against this?! The judicial branch seems to have taken my side in this on. They have already began filming courts on a trial basis:   Fourteen federal trial courts are taking part in the federal Judiciary's digital video pilot, which started July 18, 2011, and will evaluate the effect of cameras in courtrooms. All 14 courts volunteered to participate in the three-year experiment, which has been extended to run through July 18, 2015.

That is the worst foreseeable future I can imagine. Supreme Court Arguments are intense intellectual debates that require the 2-6 hours of debate, and a law degree to understand. The public does not have the patience, or the intellectual curiosity to be impartial.  Can you even imagine the soundbites that would come from a case like the recent ACA case?

The justices clearly lean towards strict or loose interpretations of the constitution depending on the cases, which works just fine.   The SCOTUS isn't the problem. They were never intended to legislate from the bench. The problem is Congress. They need to have the integrity to do their jobs but can't when there are so many monied interests and sharp divisions in their ranks.

scotus,2xzjkl,hitbyacar1,3,Thu Mar 5 04:04:53 2015 UTC,"In part because ""assault weapon"" isn't actually a term that means anything in particular. It has been defined in widely varying ways in different statutes, both federal and state. Just about the only common criteria is that they be semi-automatic. But the term may or may not include pistols, shotguns, detachable magazines, military ""style"" characteristics, etc. It has been argued that the term is little more than a pejorative that gun-control advocates use to ban as many different weapons as possible.   Also, ""assault weapons,"" however defined, don't necessarily count as ""dangerous and unusual,"" or at least not ""dangerously unusual"" or ""unusually dangerous."" They're firearms. All firearms are dangerous, so interpreting Heller as permitting regulation of a weapon on that basis alone is a non-starter. The only sensible reading requires one to read the terms ""dangerous"" and ""unusual"" together. But ""assault weapons"" are not obviously more dangerous than handguns or hunting rifles, two of the categories of firearms which are generally understood not to count as ""assault weapons"" (most of the definitions do not include pistols, and I don't know of any that include hunting rifles). And ""assault weapons"" are hardly unusual: there are probably about 4 million AR-15s in circulation in the US by this point in 2015, and that's just one model of rifle. Could easily be twice that number of ""assault weapons"" out there total. That's a relatively small fraction of all the firearms in circulation, but they're not exactly exotic collectors items. Anyone who wants one of these things can get one without working all that hard.   By contrast, something like a hand grenade or a rocket launcher is significantly more dangerous and harder to get one's hands on than a revolver. Explosives are a whole different category of ""dangerous,"" and explosive weapons are exceptionally unusual. That may be a bit tautological--they're unusual because they're illegal--but that doesn't necessarily change things."
scotus,2xzjkl,rdavidson24,6,Mon Mar 9 15:09:32 2015 UTC,"Dangerous and unusual is extremely vague. There's certainly an argument that many things banned in ""assault"" weapon bans, such as folding stocks, shrouds, and short barrels, are neither dangerous nor unusual."

The SG is tasked, inter alia, with representing the federal government as a whole before the highest court of the land. If that does not sound motivating to you, then you surely would not be a suitable candidate for SG. Moreover, I have yet to meet any federal litigator who does not take pride in the job.  As for the SG having no effect on Justices' opinions, know that his office is behind the vast majority of cases' receiving cert. The first document the Court typically sees of a case is the SG's brief supporting or opposing cert. Forgive me if the numbers turn out to be incorrect, as I'm recalling loosely here, but I believe the Court follows the SG's cert suggestion ~90% of the time, their docket is composed ~80% of cases he has suggested, and he 'wins' 90% of the cases his office submits a brief in.  There is a reason why the SG's office is full of former SCOTUS clerks and he is called the Tenth Justice. I am not one for exaggeration, but his office likely has the highest concentration of legal acuity and motivation in the country, all law firms included."

scotus,2vcs5p,desantoos,10,Mon Feb 9 23:16:38 2015 UTC,"As of today, I confidently predict that Thomas and Scalia will firmly dissent on both questions, though maybe not together. I think Scalia will find that no inherent right to same-sex marriage exists within the Constitution even as amended, and that whatever infringement may exist does not meet the standard of scrutiny he will assign. I think that Thomas will more emphasize what he views as the power of states to make and enforce their own laws about marriage independent of federal review, excepting only for race and religion.  I think the rest will go the other way, but not necessarily as one bloc. I think we could see a three- or even four-way ruling here, but still working out to a 7-2 vote affirming marriage equality one way or another.  I've also envisioned a possible 'middle way' the court could go, based on the two questions specified in the grant of cert for the claimants in the Sixth Circuit. I think the court could, with some clever calisthenics, uphold state-level DOMAs, declaring that unlike race and religion they are not subject to strict scrutiny and defending a state's strong public policy is a valid pursuit of a legitimate state purpose -- while at the same time mandating full reciprocity, on the argument that a marriage lawfully conducted in one state must be valid in all, or else chaos and inherent interstate inequality follows. That would allow states to keep their stupid laws, but render them all but toothless for their practical effect. Sort of a Solomoic splitting of the baby."

scotus,2vcs5p,mangoon,1 point,Tue Feb 10 11:00:25 2015 UTC,I guess it must be 6-3 as well. If Roberts disagreed then they would have had enough votes to grant cert in October.  Alito not concurring in Thomas's dissent of the denial of a stay indicates that even Alito believes that there aren't enough votes--and won't be enough votes--to uphold gay marriage bans.
scotus,2vcs5p,sylban,1 point,Tue Feb 10 17:18:09 2015 UTC,"It's a good question, to be sure. The ever-thoughtful J. Posner has some thoughts on Alito's position on SSM that I found insightful.

scotus,2vcs5p,outlier_lynn,2,Thu Mar 5 04:39:51 2015 UTC,"I guess you are right, but I still don't see how today's denial of a stay makes any sense in light of the upcoming argument."

I think the court will protect same-sex marriage, but I also think that the morality brigade want a chance to get in a dissenting view. For instance, Thomas and Scalia might write something interesting to read. :)"
scotus,2vcs5p,outlier_lynn,2,Tue Feb 10 00:00:22 2015 UTC,"I dunno. I think it's pretty telling that they only granted cert on the cases from the 6th Circuit - the only Circuit that has upheld the gay marriage bans. They let stand all of the other federal CoA decisions that struck them down. They didn't even have the 4 votes needed to grant cert and hear those cases. That, coupled with their refusal yesterday to stay the Alabama order, would seem to be a strong indication that they are going to rule in favor of gay marriage."

I guess that's to distract readers from the fact that the EPA was created by executive order by Nixon in 1970, and the Clean Water Act was shoved past his veto two years later by a supermajority in both houses of a bipartisan Congress (both houses less than 60% controlled by either party).  You can make a fair argument that Congress should not delegate as much as it does, though one might wonder how anything will get done if they're busy running the executive branch. I can even see a fair argument about the appropriate reach and scope of administrative law. But predicating that on thin arguments based in a mixture of distortions, wand-waving vagaries, and more than a little ignorance about how water works makes for a pretty poor case, I feel. Just my unqualified opinion. But at least I can admit it."

I've seen conservative and liberal law bloggers alike praise this dissent for its cogency. And I think it's elegant because it describes why it is important to common people.   For centuries now, people have come to this country from every corner of the world to share in the blessing of religious freedom. Our Constitution promises that they may worship in their own way, without fear of penalty or danger, and that in itself is a momentous offering. Yet our Constitution makes a commitment still more remarkable—that however those individuals worship, they will count as full and equal American citizens. A Christian, a Jew, a Muslim (and so forth)—each stands in the same relationship with her country, with her state and local communities, and with every level and body of government. So that when each person performs the duties or seeks the benefits of citizenship, she does so not as an adherent to one or another religion, but simply as an American."

The opinions addressed primarily the question of whether the Due Process Clause was violated by a state statute that authorized a private party to impose a physical separation and subordination of the people formerly subject to enslavement. The majority said there was nothing in the Constitution that prevented this exercise of private discrimination. Souter and I suppose Linda Greenhouse, whose column is the source here, are under the spell of a liberal doctrine that praise Brown v. Board of Education without admitting the historic basis on which it rests.

He grew up in a time when the definition of ""woman"" and ""law clerk"" did not overlap, even a little. Women didn't really enter the workforce until he was in his 60s. Hope whatever you want, the man would have been extraordinary, given his generation, if he had hired Ginsburg. It's too bad he wasn't, sure, but it definitely wasn't atypical; the law and the notions that underpin it are different for every generation, and acting surprised when someone from a bygone era holds what we now consider unacceptable views is...well, hopefully it'll wear off fast, because it's probably going to keep happening. It's incumbent on us to obey the dictates of our own conscience and live according to what we now hold to be decent, but every other generation lives according to its own standards.

If was not compliant for some reason, it's unclear how it could not be made 'ready'. And if that was they case, I would presume he would offer a timeline for compliance. (E.g., ""I'm not ready to hire a woman right now, but should be in about three weeks, according to the contractor."")  I suppose it's possible he had the place papered in porn, and would therefore not be 'ready,' but again, it should not take long to make it 'ready,' unless he was for some reason unable or unwilling. But this is obviously an extreme alternative interpretation, and very unlikely.  When I ponder the possibilities, the one that makes the most sense to me is that he was simply being sexist and had a personal issue with it.

However, absent a warrant, they can't compel you to unlock the phone because in doing so they would be allowed to search it, which requires a warrant.

In fact, the fees far exceed the cost of maintaining the system, making the claim that the fees are ""reasonable"" questionable.   People have challenged PACER's fees in the past (a notable example: Carl Malamud and Aaron Swartz). But unfortunately, so far it hasn't been too successful in changing the system.  It does seem unreasonable that in 2014, we're paying ""per page"" (what does that even mean when it comes to showing me a docket??) and fees are going up rather than down.

This means that there is absolutely nothing stopping random clueless people from making a ton of worthless predictions (this can happen in a prediction market too, but there the clueless people have to be willing to waste their money, and the presence of a large number of clueless people throwing away money is a strong incentive for smart people to join the market and take advantage of them).  In the other direction, who made what predictions is public, so there is (as far as I can tell) nothing stopping a large number of people from simply copying every prediction that the ""random guy in Queens"" makes so that they can tie with him for the grand prize.

That said, I've read the argument and it seems to hinge on the Baker case. Basically back in the 70's a case made it to the circuit court of appeals about gay marraige's legality under the constitution. The circuit court held that it was fine to make gay marriage illegal. An appeal went to the supreme court. But the supreme court rejected the case, issuing a short statement saying that it didn't warrant review.  I agree with most of the other circuits who have already considered this incident. The Baker case is mostly irrelevant because it has either already been overruled by Windsor or doesn't even count at all. Denial of cert at the Supreme Court is, today, not allowed to be used as an argument for legal standing. Even though there was a written explanation to go along with it, it too is not considered to be used for legal standing. Furthermore, I think Windsor shows that there has been great development on how people acknowledge and recognize what homosexuality is, physically and culturally. Thus I think the First Circuit will reverse this decision.  I don't think there will be a circuit split for gay marriage. Windsor's language seems pretty binding."

scotus,2jypgr,ANewMachine615,6,Wed Oct 22 18:26:34 2014 UTC,"Polygamy is hugely complicated as a legal idea. You'd have to rewrite absolutely everything about marriage law to make polygamy work. To wit: Adam is married to Betty and Christine, but Betty and Christine don't have any relationship to each other whatsoever. First, is such a union possible, or do Betty and Christine have to marry each other to also marry Adam? Second, Adam dies with no will, owning a house in his own name. What do Betty and Christine inherit as a share of his estate? The laws of intestacy are not at all set up to handle this type of probate, as they are premised on the idea of only a single inheriting spouse.  Another example: Adam, Betty, and Christine again, only Betty and Christine are also married to each other. Christine wants to divorce Adam, but stay with Betty. Is this possible? If so, how is the marital estate divided?  Another example: Adam and Betty are married, and meet Christine. They want to marry her into the family. Is this possible, or do Adam and Betty have to get divorced, then marry each other and Christine at the same time? The laws defining creation and dissolution of marriages are totally premised on them being a two-party thing.  Gay marriage is basically totally non-disruptive to existing law on marriage, as the genders are irrelevant to all of those questions. When it's just Adam and Betty, it doesn't matter whether the person who dies is male or female, so there's no functional difference to moving to Adam and Bob and dealing with their administration. Polygamy would undermine the central assumption in all law that relates in any way to marriage -- that it is between two and only two parties.

That makes it far more likely that a court will find the classification rationally related to a legitimate government interest.   You have your standards wrong. The Court has NEVER stated that for marriage to exist it must serve a legitimate government purpose. Rather, the trending case law states that Marriage is closer to a fundamental right, and therefore the burden is on the government to show a compelling government reason to deny it to anyone. Therefore, to use polygamy is there a compelling governmental interest to deny the right of consenting adults to marry? Arguably, No, because marriage is a fundamental right that can't be deprive to consenting adults."

But there are very, very few cases in which the gender of the participants is relevant to any legal outcome. The only one I can think of is the rule in most states that any children born to a married woman are by default considered the children of her spouse, absent some showing to the contrary. And even then, the courts have long recognized that as a practical expedient rather than a statement of genetic fact. There are several cases in which a person later proves they are the actual biological father of a child, but is denied parental rights because they failed to appeal the default assignment within the statutory deadline. So it wouldn't be too absurd an outcome for a child to be declared legally the progeny of two women, as the law recognizes a distinction between biological and legal parenthood.  Other than that edge case, which I don't think is actually a problem, gay marriage is totally undisruptive of other legal institutions. When a spouse dies, the surviving spouse gets X% of their estate. It's not like a dead husband leaves his wife X, and a dead wife leaves her husband Y%, so the gender of the inheriting partner matters to the outcome.  But a dead husband with four wives, who may or may not be in a marital relationship with each other... well, that's a helluva lot more complicated, and not at all dealt with by current law. And marriage is touched on by a vast number of laws, all of which presume that the marriage has two parties and is totally reciprocal to all parties. Tax law, criminal law, evidentiary law (the spousal privilege for instance), inheritance, certain types of agency, property law, family law, bankruptcy, collections... the list goes on. Marriage is a central legal institution whose importance cannot really be overstated.    The Court has NEVER stated that for marriage to exist it must serve a legitimate government purpose.   Which court? Several have applied the rational basis test (which is what I outlined there) in marriage equality cases. However, you said capital-C ""Court,"" which generally means SCOTUS. While Loving includes dicta stating that marriage is a fundamental right, the operative portion of that opinion was based on the impermissible racial classifications drawn by the statutes at issue, not the fundamental rights analysis. The fundamental rights argument is literally four sentences in one paragraph of a 13-page opinion. Even that makes a reference to the racial classifications as being the most problematic part (""To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State's citizens of liberty without due process of law""). Moreover, it's questionable whether Loving's dicta can be so greatly be expanded from the specific form of marriage they were discussing as to include polygamous relationships.

scotus,2idv5q,RAndrewOhge,2,Sun Oct 5 20:35:07 2014 UTC,"The Return of the Corporate Court  Posted on Oct 2, 2014 By Bill Blum  [Photo: An Amazon.com employee stocks products along one of the many miles of aisles at an fulfillment center in Phoenix. AP/Ross D. Franklin]  Jesse Busk has almost no chance of winning his lawsuit when it comes before the Supreme Court for oral argument Wednesday during the opening week of the new 2014-15 term.   His dismal prospects stem not from any legal weaknesses in his case but from one overriding fatal flaw—he’s an ordinary working person challenging the prerogatives of corporate power.  Cases like his seldom succeed before the panel led by Chief Justice John Roberts, rated by many observers and scholars as the most pro-business iteration of the high tribunal since the early 1930s.  Busk used to work as an Amazon.com “warehouse associate” in Las Vegas, filling orders placed by customers of the online retail behemoth, earning between $11.65 and $12.35 an hour without health care or paid leave for shifts that typically lasted 12 hours.   Technically, he wasn’t employed by Amazon but by Delaware-based Integrity Staffing Solutions Inc., a high-powered nationwide agency that provides temporary workers to Amazon as well as other big-name companies such as Walmart, JPMorgan Chase and Zappos.com.  As depicted in the CNBC documentary “Amazon Rising” that aired in June, the services that warehouse associates perform hoisting commodities large and small off shelves and onto giant conveyor belts for packing and mailing are grueling and unrelenting, relieved only by 30-minute meal breaks and brief trips to the bathroom that are discouraged by supervisors.   One former employee interviewed in the film described her stint at the massive complexes that Amazon euphemistically labels “fulfillment centers” as akin to time served “in a prison.”  In 2010, Busk and Laurie Castro, a warehouse associate from the fulfillment center in Fernley, Nev., filed a federal class-action lawsuit against Integrity, alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the New Deal-era statute designed to protect the rights of hourly workers to minimum wages, prompt paychecks and overtime.   Among other grievances, they contended they were owed back pay for uncompensated time spent checking out of work each day, standing in airport-like security lines for up to 25 minutes.   Together with hundreds of other workers, they were required to remove their wallets, keys and belts, and made to pass through metal detectors and sometimes had their bodies passed over with hand-held wands to prevent employee theft and what Amazon calls “inventory shrinkage.”  In 2011, a federal District Court judge dismissed their complaint, holding that end-of-day security checkouts are not subject to FLSA as they aren’t part of an employee’s actual work activities but merely “postliminary” to those activities.   Two years later, however, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals—still the country’s most liberal appellate body—reversed and reinstated the FLSA-based security checkout claim, creating a split in authority among the federal circuits on the proper interpretation of the act.  Integrity responded by retaining the services of conservative super lawyer Paul Clement, and in March the Supreme Court granted Integrity’s petition to review the 9th Circuit’s ruling.   Since then, Clement, who teaches law at Georgetown University and once served as solicitor general and acting attorney general under President George W. Bush, has been joined by an array of powerful business lobbies, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, which have filed amicus (friend-of-the-court) briefs in support of Integrity.   The Obama administration also has filed an amicus pleading backing Integrity’s narrow reading of the FLSA.  Although the Supreme Court often agrees to hear cases in which, as in this instance, the lower courts are divided on an important question of law, the real reason it has agreed to hear Busk and Castro’s suit, quite simply, is that it represents yet another opportunity for it to come to the rescue of its corporate patrons.   Among other rulings since the appointment of Roberts to the chief’s position in 2005, the court has upheld the constitutionality of state right-to-work laws and imposed new burdens on employees seeking to file racial and sex discrimination complaints against their employers and disability claims against workplace insurers.   The court has also shielded companies from liability for defective and dangerous products, reduced the financial risks of environmental pollution and opened the door to unlimited corporate political spending with its landmark Citizens United decision.  Last term, in a heated 5-4 opinion (Harris v. Quinn), the court delivered a near-fatal blow to the right of public-employee unions to collect “fair-share” fees in lieu of formal dues from nonunion members to defray the costs of collective bargaining that benefits all employees.   And in a unanimous 9-0 decision (Sandifer v. United States Steel Corp.) joined even by the court’s Democratic appointees that all but dooms Busk and Castro, the panel held that steelworkers are not entitled to compensation under FLSA for time spent donning and doffing bulky protective gear before and after work.  Should Busk and Castro somehow defy the heavy odds and manage to salvage a victory—meaning their case is permitted to proceed to trial on the issue of monetary damages—they plan to add Amazon as a formal defendant along with Integrity.   A win before the Supreme Court would also breathe new life into a slew of similar cases brought by workers across the country against Amazon and other businesses such as Apple and Urban Outfitters that also subject their staffs to anti-theft security probes.  Companies such as Apple and Amazon, which rank as the first and 24th most valuable U.S.-listed corporations, respectively, could easily absorb the added labor costs entailed in fully compensating their workers.   But as Busk put it in a 2013 interview with The Huffington Post—and more importantly as the Supreme Court under Roberts sees it—“the mindset” is “just to be grateful you have a job.”  Could we expect anything less from the most powerful legal body in the land, now known unaffectionately far and wide as the “corporate court”?  http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/the_return_of_the_corporate_court_20141002"

I read newspapers. I followed general news. I just couldn't figure out SCOTUS. I decided that I wanted to change this, and I just started reading opinions and following dedicated news outlets (I have no law degree).  Now, when I watch The Daily Show following big Supreme Court cases, I've probably already read the opinions. It straight-up pisses me off that Dahlia Lithwick's one job is to follow SCOTUS and lower courts, that she's had this one job for fourteen years, and somehow cannot manage to find they key words ""traditional public forum"" in response to Jon's completely understandable confusion. It seems to not matter that this is the very first thing held by the Court in the syllabus or that it was the very first thing in Section II (stating the legal principles in play). No, her ""close reading"" comes up with the idea that 'some people have rights, and others don't.' Again, I'm not particularly highly legally educated (and hadn't paid much attention to this particular case except for reading the opinions once), and I was practically yelling this at my tv... and wishing that Jon would occasionally have a Supreme Court expert on who just wants to tell him what the Supreme Court actually did."

III. In essence, they are arguing that unless the violation of a statutory protection causes some concrete, measurable injury, then no harm, no foul.  If the Court buys that argument, then pretty much every consumer protection law in the country which creates a private cause of action for violation of said protections would be unconstitutional.   Needless to say, the business community and defense bar cares a bit about the outcome of this case."
scotus,2epzov,autowikibot,2,Wed Aug 27 13:09:50 2014 UTC,"Case or Controversy Clause:       The Supreme Court of the United States has interpreted the Case or Controversy Clause of Article III of the United States Constitution (found in Art. III, Section 2, Clause 1) as embodying two distinct limitations on exercise of the ""judicial review.""        The Court has held that the clause identifies the scope of matters which a federal court can and cannot consider as a case (i.e., it distinguishes between lawsuits within and beyond the institutional competence of the federal judiciary), and limits federal judicial power only to such lawsuits as the court is competent to hear.  For example, the Court has determined that this clause prohibits the issuance of advisory opinions (in which no actual issue exists but an opinion is sought), and claims where the appellant stands to gain only in a generalized sense (i.e. no more or less than people at large), and allows only the adjudication of claims where (1) the plaintiff has actually and personally suffered injury or harm ""in fact"", (2) the injury or harm suffered by the plaintiff is fairly traceable to the defendant's actions and (3) the injury or harm would be capable of redress by the court.   The Court has also interpreted the clause as limiting Congress' ability to confer jurisdiction on federal courts. It does so by establishing an outer limit of the types of matters within which Congress may constitutionally confer jurisdiction. Historically, the Court has not interpreted this Clause to limit Congressional power to restrict the jurisdiction of the federal courts.   The delicate phrasing of the Clause and the ambiguity of the terms therein has inspired frequent academic debate. Though the Supreme Court has given much attention to the legal issues arising from this provision of the Constitution, many problematic issues remain unresolved. Critics argue that the standing requirements imposed by this Clause enable judges to avoid difficult issues, decide the merits of a case before the parties have had a fair opportunity to litigate, and avoid the necessity of applying law the judge finds distasteful.

scotus,2epzov,hey_sergio,2,Wed Aug 27 13:10:01 2014 UTC,Are the States bound by Article III?
scotus,2epzov,hey_sergio,2,Wed Aug 27 16:18:43 2014 UTC,"Specifically? No. But many states have a substantially similar standing requirement, and state courts tend to find Supreme Court opinions interpreting federal laws directly analogous to state laws to be pretty persuasive. Indeed, in my previous jurisdiction, a decent chunk of the jurisprudence on state civil procedure was basically federal district court opinions, as the state rules were explicitly cribbed from the federal rules.   So, for instance, in my state, there's a rule of civil procedure which requires that suits be maintained by the ""real party in interest,"" and the state supreme court has held that the interest needs to be ""immediate and pecuniary."" The argument would be that a violation of a statutory right that is not accompanied by an independent pecuniary interest wouldn't been that standard.  So no, the outcome of this case wouldn't be immediately binding, but yes, it has the potential to be enormously problematic.   There's also the possibility that someone could interpret the standing requirement of Art. III into a due process requirement under Amend. XIV. That would make it binding."
scotus,2epzov,hey_sergio,1 point,Wed Aug 27 16:42:16 2014 UTC,but this is limited to consumer protection statutes that expressly provide for private relief.  i think that invoking Art III in this context would offend Federalism.
scotus,2epzov,nieuweyork,1 point,Wed Aug 27 16:47:50 2014 UTC,"What a defendant would do would be to invoke that state's standing requirement, show how the Supreme Court had interpreted the analogous federal standing requirement (Art. III), and argue that the state courts should follow the same rule. It's not a slam-dunk argument, but it's a potentially very persuasive one."
scotus,2epzov,nieuweyork,2,Wed Aug 27 16:51:05 2014 UTC,"i understand it, but i'm not terribly afraid of it. if state courts wanted to be hostile to consumers there are already plenty of other ways to reach that result."

scotus,2epzov,Droviin,1 point,Wed Aug 27 17:08:08 2014 UTC,"I think you're missing the point. Consumer protection laws almost uniformly come with some kind of de-minimus statutory damages.

scotus,2c1f61,rdavidson24,10,Tue Jul 29 13:05:38 2014 UTC,"Did the courts just change the terminology from ""reasonable person,"" or is an ""objective observer"" an entirely different term?   Check page 31 of the opinion. The court discusses the relationship between the two standards and gives ample citations to other opinions.   The ""reasonable person"" standard is a feature of tort law--mostly anyway--and that's not really what's in view when parsing alleged First Amendment establishment violations. The ""reasonable person"" standard has to do with what an ordinary adult of average prudence would do when faced with the information available to a particular party in a particular case. The ""objective observer"" standard has to do with what a person who ""knows all of the pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the symbol and its placement"" would conclude about a particular symbol's significance, both religious and otherwise.   So the difference is that with the ""reasonable person"" standard, you think about what an ordinary person would do given only the information available to a party in the circumstances in question, not under the totality of the information out there. By contrast, with the ""objective observer"" standard, you consider all of the information out there. In short, the ""objective observer"" analysis permits a far more searching inquiry into the facts and circumstances of the case over time, whereas the ""reasonable person"" analysis is basically limited to what a party actually knew (or should have known) at the actual moment of the alleged wrongdoing.   Note that the court does occasionally use the term ""reasonable observer,"" which doesn't help things. But the ""reasonable person"" and ""objective observer"" tests are distinct, do have independent existence in the case law, and this does not represent a shift away from established First Amendment jurisprudence. Quite the contrary."

scotus,2ble7d,sylban,2,Thu Jul 24 19:54:37 2014 UTC,"IANAL  Norway follows a version of the Civil Law system, based on Roman Law (and more specifically the Code of Justinian). Most English-speaking countries, including the U.S., follow a version of Common Law, which is based in English systems of several centuries ago. They are very similar in most respects, but differ in some notable ways.  One of those is the role of case law. In most Civil Law systems, case law informs interpretation but has no binding effect. In most Common Law systems, case law has significant binding effect, such that case law may even overturn and vacate statutes.  Through this process, Common Law evolves various 'doctrines' that guide future interpretation, such that certain concepts emerge synergistically rather than explicitly. For example, the 'right to privacy' is not explicitly defined in our national Constitution, but is rather derived from a history of case law interpreting the parts that are explicit. And what will likely emerge in another year or so as a 'right to marry' will also not be based on any language explicitly saying that, but rather derived by interpretation from what is there, and a substantial body of case law shaping our understanding of it.  I have not yet found a specific Supreme Court case addressing this, but I've found reference to several Circuit Court rulings that do. From what I'm reading, federal courts fairly universally consider begging in and of itself to be a form of protected speech. I'm presuming that some or all of the cases I found reference within them one or more Supreme Court cases addressing relevant aspects of this, but I have not read any of them.  In the U.S., the concept of 'free speech' is taken very seriously. What is lawfully proscribed 'hate speech' in much of the rest of the Western world is protected speech here. To the extent that panhandling (begging for money on public streets) is considered protected speech by the courts, it would be generally protected from government restriction, especially outright bans.  That has not stopped cities from trying, though, and they still do.  Most likely, there is not a Supreme Court case directly or explicitly addressing panhandling. Rather, there are likely a number of Supreme Court cases addressing component issues, such as the extent and nature of protected speech, what does and does not constitute free expression, and so on, and lower courts have taken those and applied them to the specific question of panhandling."

Most states are presumed to have complete control over that, enjoying even arbitrary and capricious restraint. (Rhode Island banned ""4Q2-DMV,"" for example.) There have been challenges, but I think a court would first of all apply a standard that it's allowable to restrict anything patently offensive such as ""NIGGERS"" (or ""N1GRZ"" or whatever other extremely clever constructions the brilliant minds of racial bigots might come up with). But I think they'd further note that that argument, while valid, is unnecessary because such constructions are at most a privilege, not any kind of obligation, and constitute government speech since their purpose is to uniquely identify the vehicle.  This case is about the overall design of the plate, not its unique string of identifying characters. As much as I respect the court's opinion, it's difficult for me to see how this would prevent, say, ""God Hates Fags"" license plates. If we argue that they plate itself is private rather than public speech, then I think it opens the door to a great deal of abuse."

It's fine to disagree with RFRA, but if you're going to base most of your article on ""we're not going to pay taxes for things we disagree with,"" you might want to be aware that the Supreme Court drew a bright line between paying taxes for things you object to and paying employee benefits for things you object to:   Based on that premise, we explained that it was untenable to allow individuals to seek exemptions from taxes based on religious objections to particular Government expenditures: “If, for example, a religious adherent believes war is a sin, and if a certain percentage of the federal budget can be identified as devoted to war-related activities, such individuals would have a similarly valid claim to be exempt from paying that percentage of the income tax.” Ibid. We observed that “[t]he tax system could not function if denominations were allowed to challenge the tax system because tax payments were spent in a manner that violates their religious belief.”  Lee was a free-exercise, not a RFRA, case, but if the issue in Lee were analyzed under the RFRA framework, the fundamental point would be that there simply is no less restrictive alternative to the categorical requirement to pay taxes. Because of the enormous variety of government expenditures funded by tax dollars, allowing taxpayers to withhold a portion of their tax obligations on religious grounds would lead to chaos. Recognizing exemptions from the contraceptive mandate is very different. ACA does not create a large national pool of tax revenue for use in purchasing healthcare coverage. Rather, individual employers like the plaintiffs purchase insurance for their own employees. And contrary to the principal dissent's characterization, the employers' contributions do not necessarily funnel into “undifferentiated funds.” Post, at ––––. The accommodation established by HHS requires issuers to have a mechanism by which to “segregate premium revenue collected from the eligible organization from the monies used to provide payments for contraceptive services.” 45 CFR § 147.131(c)(2)(ii). Recognizing a religious accommodation under RFRA for particular coverage requirements, therefore, does not threaten the viability of ACA's comprehensive scheme in the way that recognizing religious objections to particular expenditures from general tax revenues would."

RFRA indicates a federal law or regulation is invalid if it substantially burdens a persons practice of religion unless it is the least restrictive means to further a compelling government interest.  The Court decided that having to pay for something you considered to be murder, or pay a 475 million dollar fine was a substantial burden. They granted for the sake of argument that helping women gain access to contraception was a compelling government interest. They then decided the fine was not the least restrictive means since HHS already had a program in place to help women whose employers (though limited to non-profits) had religious objections.  No part of his analysis rejects or argues against any part of the courts analysis. If his dispute is that corporations are not ""persons"", despite federal law defining them to be, what is his solution?

The law says that anyone else should get the rights to those exceptions, if they want to claim those exceptions.  Also, those exceptions were predicated on the fact that the executive branch allowed the insurance companies to pay for the coverage themselves, or the government to pay.

scotus,29i0r7,Neurokeen,1 point,Mon Jun 30 19:56:50 2014 UTC,"Just so I understand this correctly, the non-profit court battles are actually arguing that the fact that they have to sign off on their non-coverage in order for the federal government to cover their lapse is a substantial burden?  Whereas Hobby Lobby was about the employer itself providing said coverage?  If I was skimming over Hobby Lobby correctly, the entire point of the least restrictive means argument is that the federal government does, in fact, provide this Form 700 option to non-profits, and the fact that this is an option for non-profits but was not for the plaintiff was the primary thrust of the failure on least restrictive means, no? So doesn't this actually go against the Hobby Lobby ruling by pulling the rug out from the less restrictive option?  I could very well be misinterpreting Hobby Lobby - I haven't trudged through it in its entirety yet. It's quite the monster of an opinion, and it's clearly why it was the last one to be finished this term."
scotus,29h3lp,rearview1,11,Mon Jun 30 14:29:44 2014 UTC,"More accurately: the court held that closely held private corporations that hold genuine religious beliefs, cannot be forced to pay for the contraceptive coverage when there is a less restrictive means available for the government to achieve it's goal. Here, the government could pay for the contraceptives, as they currently do for religious non-profits."
scotus,29h3lp,h2g2Ben,3,Mon Jun 30 14:46:56 2014 UTC,So ELI5 please.  How does the government give free contraceptive to women?  Does this mean funding to organizations like Planned parenthood are required?
scotus,29h3lp,Tanjello,4,Mon Jun 30 15:20:14 2014 UTC,"The government already provides contraceptives for employees of religious not-for-profits, so the government can provide contraceptives to employees of for-profit companies using the exact same mechanism.  Specifically, the government subsidizes the insurance companies for providing the contraceptives while the employer subsidizes the insurance company for all other healthcare costs."

scotus,29h3lp,PARK_THE_BUS,2,Tue Jul 1 11:11:12 2014 UTC,"These will have to be addressed on a case-by-case basis by the courts. Blood transfusions are a necessary treatment for many diseases and a component of many routine surgeries. The government would likely argue that it's interest in ensuring that people get competent treatment for diseases is narrowly tailored through requiring that employers pay for insurance. Because it is narrowly tailored to a compelling state interest, it passes the test. Further, there is no specific requirement in the law that employers pay for transfusions, just health insurance (and contraceptives for women).  Also, more practically, there are no jehovah's witnesses on the supreme court, and those views are substantially more marginal than those relating to birth control."

scotus,2924rc,desantoos,2,Fri Jun 27 04:18:52 2014 UTC,"Is this case revolving around Riley's issue, or is it referring to cellphones in general?  Edit: Wikipedia states ""Given these cases, the Court concluded that the search and seizure of Riley's cell phone was valid.""  But didn't the judge say that they need a warrant, shouldn't the search and seizure of Riley'y cellphone be invalid??  Also, What is the Majority, Dissenting, and concurring opinion?"
scotus,2924rc,desantoos,2,Fri Jun 27 02:29:56 2014 UTC,"This Supreme Court Opinion is based upon two cases that they lumped together (since their appeals judgement contradict each other). The opinion is broad:   Held: The police generally may not, without a warrant, search digital  information on a cell phone seized from an individual who has been arrested.   This is a rare instance where the Supreme Court went broad and declared something so simply and openly.  The Supreme Court is reversing the California court's decision to deny Riley a rehearing where the illegally searched private information was obtained. Riley will likely get a re-trial where the correct evidence is used and not the stuff obtained illegally.  The Supreme Court works on determining judgement and opinion. A judgement is basically a tally of whether you are for something or against it. In this case, all nine justices agree on the same judgement (to reverse the one case and affirm the other). Opinion is the reason why the judgement is the way it is. Each justice must provide or agree to a reason why he or she voted on a judgement. A majority opinion is when five or more justices agree on the reasons why a judgement is the way it is. A concurring opinion is an opinion that agrees with the judgement but not the reason behind it. In this case, Alito agreed that one should be reversed and the other affirmed but had a far narrower stance on what that should be (which makes sense since Alito loves to grant as many rights as possible to law enforcement). A plurality opinion occurs if there is no opinion that has five or more justices agreeing. This frequently happens in the more complicated decisions. A dissenting opinion is one where the person does not agree with the judgement and thus must explain why. Scalia's favorite thing to do is write dissents that are overly dramatic and full of puns."

scotus,2924rc,5yearsleft,2,Fri Jun 27 23:26:17 2014 UTC,I am very pleased by this decision.  A little bit of privacy goes a long way on the the path to freedom.
scotus,2924rc,bluefootedpig,-1,Fri Jun 27 16:44:20 2014 UTC,"So I am kind of against privacy for various reasons, but I understand that people want to remain private, so I am not surprised by the SCOTUS ruling on cell phone searches.  That said, why is warrentless cell phone searching bad? the two prime cases were people who were wanted people, doing illegal activities. One (the one this links) was found as part of a gang, transporting guns if I am not mistaken. This arrest might have saved a handful of people who might have died if the gang got their guns.   Are there cases where the cell phone was used against someone who was innocent?   It seems from all the cases I can find regarding this law, innocent people got off, bad people got caught. Am I wrong or missing something?  As a note, I can understand the other case, where they discovered the home and searched it. That, to me is going too far. But searching for text messages and contacts, I don't see why that would be wrong.   /discuss"
scotus,2924rc,UmberGryphon,6,Wed Jun 25 16:48:53 2014 UTC,"In totalitarian states, the police would often open and read people's mail before delivering it, hoping to find evidence of subversion or rebellion.  During the civil rights movement, the FBI tried to find evidence that peaceful protesters (including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.) had committed crimes, so that they could either arrest them or blackmail them into not challenging the status quo.  We all commit crimes.  We all do things that those in power aren't thrilled about.  If those in power have the authority to go looking for crimes without probable cause, what's to stop them from finding an excuse to arrest anyone they don't like?"
scotus,2924rc,bluefootedpig,3,Wed Jun 25 18:13:57 2014 UTC,"So the problem is transparency of government, not privacy. If it was discovered that government agencies were just randomly searching emails without cause, we would be upset and possibly put people in jail for it. This sounds like a government issue, not a privacy issue. It is what someone does with the information.  Take for example that someone can steal my credit card and charge on my credit. That information travels all the time, every time I buy something. It is someone who takes that information and uses it to impersonate me. There is nothing wrong or illegal (at least to me) about someone seeing my credit card number. The crime is using that information.   So yes, I understand in bad government, they will abuse this information. I think if we do open up privacy, we need to also open up government. Again, the reason they were able to do these things is the government could operate in private.   If it was discovered all mail was being read to look for communists, no matter if you were even a suspect, I think many people would reject that kind of government. Even more so if judges back. So yes it is more dangerous, but I think this is more of a transparency of government than privacy of the individual."
scotus,2924rc,triangle60,3,Wed Jun 25 18:38:11 2014 UTC,"I agree with you in part. However let's consider how we would enforce government transparency issues. It would be difficult for each of us to always be interested and active, so it would make sense to appoint a commission, who would serve on that commission? Would it be representative of the populace? ... Only something that looks a lot like government, can deal with government transparency issues, and then it becomes circular, as such we avoid the problem all together with privacy rights."
scotus,2924rc,bluefootedpig,0,Wed Jun 25 20:02:20 2014 UTC,"Personally, I would envision it more like Reddit.   GovernmentOversight.Com  You register (using like a perm address), and then you can vote / review submissions, data. Hell, I might even go so far as you can perform an audit on walmart (because all that information is available in this fantasy world). You would submit the article ""Portland, Oregon Officer, excessive use of force"", you link to the video, a discussion starts as to how far, did he officer act right.   Now lets put a threshold, only submissions over 1,000 upvotes are then reviewed by an appointed person. Kind of like the AG.   The world I envision with little to no privacy is one that is done by citizens, organized in ways we can only imagine now, now that we have ways of mass communication.   There are thousands, maybe millions of articles produced every day, yet reddit distills it to the biggest news, with subs directly about certain things. Why not do something similar?  Anyway, this is getting into the solution, details would need to be worked out, but think about this, some cities have released all the previously private information as public data, now we have walking directions that use trails. Before, we couldn't do that because the information was private. Due to opening that information, people who don't get paid, spend many hours, to make the best walking system.   Why not do that with justice?"
scotus,2924rc,triangle60,5,Wed Jun 25 20:46:58 2014 UTC,"There is plenty wrong with that. First, how do we know that all of the information will actually be published. Second, a public justice system is a terrible idea, people are full of biases and without an administration it would be a wild west. Public information about trails is nothing like public information about people. Further, there is a solid argument that people should be doing illegal things on the edge of righteousness because that is how progress is made. Complete information about the public would lead to a society of prudes who never try anything new because older generations thought it was wrong. Prudes might sound like a dumb thing to say, but I think it fits here."
scotus,2924rc,bluefootedpig,1 point,Thu Jun 26 01:43:33 2014 UTC,"First, how do we know that all of the information will actually be published.   This is a good question, and one that might need some litigation as to how to achieve it. Off the top of my head, giving access to security cameras would be the first step. Archiving to the cloud in real time.   Think about this, we are just now seeing how great it is to put a camera on each officer. Why not steam that to the cloud for citizen review? To get ALL information, we would need to start to classify information, figure out how to store it, and allow access. This is an implementation problem, not a philosophical one.    Second, a public justice system is a terrible idea, people are full of biases and without an administration it would be a wild west.    You might have missed the part where there is an appointed person who has final say on such matters. Just like a mod. Look at reddit, does every single post make it? can mods ban people? now on reddit, there is no way to remove a mod, but that is easy enough in government. Remember, the local state AG, or someone like that would have the final say, citizens only raise issues that they believe are violations of laws.   Complete information about the public would lead to a society of prudes who never try anything new because older generations thought it was wrong.    I fail to see how this comes about. People do illegal drugs now, and are arrested for it. There was NO complaints about the people we arrested. The problem came about when jails are getting full, and we are seeing huge society issues. We don't rule weed is safe because so many broke the law, but because it lacked evidence to support it while at the same time harming many. Look at other things illegal (sex with a porcupine, for example), does it take people breaking that law to fix it?   I guess I'm asking, do you believe people only break the law because they feel that they can get away with it? Do you j-walk only because you feel you can get away with it?"
scotus,2924rc,tete90,4,Thu Jun 26 16:18:14 2014 UTC,"Your repeated use of reddit as an example is pushing me further and further from your position.  Reddit is a glaring example of biased crowd think, especially as it relates to criminal justice matters.  The general lack of knowledge most people have regarding the legal system and it's execution would also create a huge hinderance to the system you describe.  Furthermore, if the system contains a choke point ""moderator"", where is the benefit compared to what we have now?  Don't journalists (mass oversight) and prosecutors (moderator) perform in a similar manner?"
scotus,2924rc,triangle60,2,Fri Jun 27 16:08:51 2014 UTC,"I don't believe that the only reason people take an action is because they can get away with it. However, I do believe that the rate at which people take an action would plummet if they could never get away with it. If I was always fined for j-walking I would definitely not J-walk.    I fail to see how this comes about. People do illegal drugs now, and are arrested for it. There was NO complaints about the people we arrested. The problem came about when jails are getting full, and we are seeing huge society issues. We don't rule weed is safe because so many broke the law, but because it lacked evidence to support it while at the same time harming many. Look at other things illegal (sex with a porcupine, for example), does it take people breaking that law to fix it?   Yes, it does take people breaking the law or an analogue to fix it. Sex with a porcupine has analogues in gay sex. It does. You might call me offensive, but Scalia was right when he said it. Both have no affect on society at large and are deemed wrong only on a basis of deontology (there are some counters here on the matter of consent, but that does not hold against every philosophical position.) If we are ever to get rid of laws against bestiality, it will almost certainly trace its roots to Lawrence v. Texas. As to the matter of no complaints of who gets arrested until prison population problems. I don't think that's true. However I don't have any data on it. The question should nevertheless be asked. Why now do we get complaints about these people being locked up, why does society at least in part understand non-violent drug offenses but not other types of offenses. I would argue it is because a huge number of people have tried drugs and in their estimation it had no ill effects. If those same people tried drugs and were immediately arrested, they would probably not have tried the drugs."
scotus,2924rc,bluefootedpig,1 point,Thu Jun 26 20:50:08 2014 UTC,"So not sure if I see much counter arguments here. But I will address the j-walking thing.  While yes, it is true that jwalking would drop if you ALWAYS got a ticket, we must remember that fellow citizens are raising the concern.   I used reddit as an example before, so if I might continue to use it, not every funny post makes it to the front page, but that doesn't mean that they aren't funny. Just some are more funny than others. With limited resources such as police, we could go after you, but it would take physical evidence (footage preferable although GPS on the cell phone might work) and while you might be guilty of it, it would still require X people to vote that you deserve to be punished for it. Let me clarify, as reddit does, it would require X upvotes over downvotes.  So lets say you did jwalk, nothing happened. You might be reported, but then 1000 people would have to say, ""yes, this person deserves a fine"". I doubt that would happen EVERY SINGLE TIME. What might happen is if you jwalked and some car had to swerve to avoid hitting you. Then many people would upvote that, your jwalking was dangerous.   This goes for drug offenses as well. You can do drugs in private residences, the property you own, but in public you might be seen. So you do drugs in private, you learn they aren't that bad. Now your neighbor wants you arrested for it, but every other pot head in the country might downvote it. So now you can complain all you want, but the general public is saying, ""sorry, this is not a crime worth punishing"".   And to reinfornce this idea, there is someone who actually approves it. Citizens are only reporting crimes and telling the police / authorities whom to punish.   My guess (this is pure speculation now) is most people would go after big fish. Large companies would have armies of haters pouring over their statements, looking for irregularities. Enron would be stopped the first year it tried to do the fancy accounting. I don't think that the average citizen would be harassed, because of the simple fact that it is fellow citizens that don't know you, that are judging you.   And again, it would require evidence."

scotus,2924rc,hey_sergio,5,Wed Jun 25 17:46:09 2014 UTC,"Because it means the government is entitled to ""come across"" this information without a specific determination of probable cause by a neutral and detached magistrate.  What is so difficult to understand about why that offends liberty?"
scotus,2924rc,bluefootedpig,1 point,Wed Jun 25 18:38:54 2014 UTC,"So the issue is not on my information, but on what governments and our justice system does with it.   Let's start simple, and say the only law is not to kill. Would you be against government searching only for information about killings? Remember, drugs, stealing, etc are all legal right now.   If you would not mind government looking at information for killers, and killers only, then the problem lies with transparency of government coupled with justice. We want privacy because we are scofflaws, because we break the law knowingly and with hubris.  So your question isn't anything with ""liberty"" but with corruption of power. So really we should be asking, ""What kind of system can we minimize corruption"". In the past, this was solved by keeping as much private as possible, because the government ALSO operated in private. Our original governments of a king, the king's life was private.   But now imagine that we have a 100% transparent government, you can review every single court case, every single arrest, etc. YOU, as joe public, can review and report abuse. Reported abuse WILL result in punishment to the government employee if enough people not only agree, but a 3rd party then agrees with the people (think reddit + mods). Would you still be able to abuse this information?"
scotus,2924rc,hey_sergio,1 point,Wed Jun 25 18:42:12 2014 UTC,"You are mistaken.  Liberty is impossible without privacy--the freedom to determine who is and is not authorized to know certain things about yourself.  If any of these certain things must be known to advance an interest in law enforcement, that is where the 4th Amendment comes into play.  And it has a clear answer: you need a warrant. Period.  Otherwise highly intimate details are not private, and without privacy, there is no liberty."
scotus,2924rc,bluefootedpig,-1,Wed Jun 25 20:06:37 2014 UTC,"So you are saying me, knowing the color of your skin due to physically seeing you is limiting your liberty? You don't get to choose who sees your skin color. I don't think anyone is losing liberty by knowing my skin color, and if I do lose liberty because of my skin color, that is actually against the law.   So what else can we know by public information? I can know where you live, how much you paid for your house, if you carry insurance on your car, how many cars you have. I can, via public information, find all kinds of data on you.   Hell, if i go through your username, I bet I can find more information about the person known as /u/hey_sergio , now if I can link that to a person (known as doxxing), then I can get even more, all without your consent, and all done via public information.   So I have all this information on you, lets say for argument sake I did doxx you and I have all that information, right now, in front of me. Let's go one step further and say I have had it for 1 year now. Over the last year, how has your liberty been affected by my knowing of your non-consented data?  I think you are mistaken. Liberty is only possible when people act in the correct manner to the data they have. Liberty doesn't require privacy, breaking the law requires privacy.   Under your ideal, and correct me if I am wrong, but you are saying that in a transparent society, there is no liberty? it is impossible for people to be free in a transparent society?"

The discussion, at least for me, was on if liberty can be achieved without privacy, which I think I defended fairly well. No doubt privacy is a concept in liberty, but I don't think it is defining of liberty.   Privacy is key to liberty because the government is private. The balance of power then shows that a citizen must have equal power. If government was transparent, then you can't have the same abuse as a private government. Right now, and all governments I can think of, are private governments. We really haven't seen an open and transparent governments (they might exist or have, but I know of none).   To me, privacy as you outline it, is not required for privacy, but required for a private government. If your government has secrets, then the citizen must be able to keep secrets as well."

The Circuit ruling takes effect for all Tenth Circuit jurisdictions, at least until SCOTUS takes up a parallel case?  Or, could they affirm without comment? Then what? It takes effect only for the Tenth Circuit?  Might they instead wait for a split? (Say, from the Fourth Circuit, currently hearing Virginia's appeal in Bostic v. Rainey?)

Who Are Your Heroes?” and depicts pop culture icons alongside Jesus Christ. Anticipating the desired answer to the poster’s question, there were several stations indicating that children and students could obtain religious literature tailored to them   Honestly, these things are much more invasive than the cross on the wall. In a more apt version of Scalia's metaphorical rock concert, the people running the concert would need to be going up to him to proselytize about the virtues of rock music with pamphlets and put up posters all around him challenging his music views while he watches his kid receive a diploma standing underneath a giant Robert Plant statue. It's a little more intimidating for non-rock fans. I don't think that he would have had the majority opinion here anyway, I get the feeling he wanted to just try and shoot the endorsement test down again, but the other justices wouldn't have followed the Town of Greece method of analysis here. It's a different enough situation and one that lends itself really really well to the endorsement test/Lemon test."

If you listen to the testimony, none of the judges sound at all persuaded by anything Coke had to say.  The basics for the case: POM made drinks with pomegranate juice. Coke made cheaper drinks that looked similar in branding, labeled them as containing pomegranate when in fact they had less than 0.1 %. POM sues under the Lenham act. Coke argues that it should be the FDA that policies these things, not other companies and so the Lenham act should be superseded by federal policy. Ninth Circuit agrees with Coke.

BP asked the 5th Circuit to stay its own mandate (which ordered BP to pay out the claims), pending the cert petition on the merits. The 5th Circuit denied that motion and issued the mandate, so BP immediately appealed that denial in order to avoid having to initiate payments.  They argued that they would suffer irreparable injury if the claims were paid out now while cert is pending on the merits, because the money would be paid out to tons of people who it would probably not be possible to get the money back from later:   If the Fifth Circuit's mandate is not recalled, many awards will be paid to claimants whose losses were indisputably not the result of BP's conduct. Even if this Court grants certiorari and rules for BP on the merits, BP may have no practical way to recoup many of these wrongly paid awards.   My reading of the posture is that the cert decision on the merits hasn't been made yet, so they could still get the main case heard.

Kent (born June 22, 1949, Denver, Colorado)  is a former U.S District Court judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, who served in the single-judge Galveston Division covering Brazoria, Chambers, Galveston, and Matagorda Counties. He was nominated by President George H.W. Bush on August 3, 1990, to a seat vacated by Hugh Gibson, confirmed by the United States Senate on September 28, 1990, and received his commission on October 1, 1990.  On May 11, 2009, Judge Kent was sentenced to 33 months in prison for lying to investigators about sexually abusing two female employees. Dick DeGuerin, Kent's attorney, said the judge would retire from the bench because of a disability, rather than resign, thereby enabling Kent to keep receiving his $169,300 annual salary for life.  That did not satisfy the leaders of the House Judiciary Committee, Representatives John Conyers Jr., (D-Mich.) and Lamar Smith (R-Tex.), who demanded that Kent resign immediately or face impeachment.   Judge Kent submitted his resignation on June 2, 2009, with the proviso that it would not take effect for a full year. This angered the membership of the House Judiciary Committee, which voted unanimously to send four Articles of Impeachment to the full House of Representatives on June 10, 2009.  The articles were passed on June 19, 2009,  making Judge Kent the first federal judge to be impeached since Walter L. Nixon, Jr. in 1989.  Kent thereafter submitted a new letter of resignation to the Senate on June 25, 2009, taking effect on June 30, 2009.   On June 30, President Barack Obama accepted his resignation.  On July 20, the House of Representatives passed a resolution  asking the Senate to end former Judge Kent's trial. Two days later, the Senate agreed to the resolution.

scotus,24b2qy,DirtyLSD,5,Tue Apr 29 20:29:42 2014 UTC,". . .   I don't even know where to start here.  I assume we're living in a universe where there are psychics and telepaths, and they have recognized powers to (1) predict the future, (2) read people's minds, and/or (3) divine things that are currently happening or happened in the past.  I think there are a few additional relevant questions:   Have these telepaths and psychics been around since the bill of rights was ratified? Were they prevalent, and were their powers recognized at that time? Have their powers become widely used by civilians since the time the bill of rights was ratified.   This also opens a relatively big can of worms regarding the fifth amendment and the right against self-incrimination, but you weren't asking that. So I'll ignore it for now.  The guiding question regarding wether a search and seizure are constitutional is whether the person subject to the search had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the items or place being searched. Say that psychics have been regularly used since 1791 to, say, locate lost or stolen goods within someone else's home. The police would reasonably be able to use the psychic to divine the location of the stolen goods, and then obtain a warrant to conduct the search of the private home. A similar situation would be conceivable for documents, storage lockers, etc.  Say that psychics are a new thing. We'll do two different scenarios.   In the last 10 years strong scientific proof has come out that there are a handful of psychics who can divine the location of a physical item. Their services are very expensive, and they are primarily used by large multinational corporations. A police department has no evidence regarding the location of a missing person, but manage to get one of these psychics to volunteer. The psychic gives an address, and the police get a search warrant, finding the person kidnapped in that residence. In this situation I think SCOTUS says it's not OK. The kidnapper had a reasonable expectation of privacy because this is not a method that ordinary people have access to to find things. Psychics have been around for 30-40 years. They are a dime a dozen and routinely used by people to find everything from missing dogs to missing people. Otherwise, same scenario as above. SCOTUS likely holds the other way. People no longer have a reasonable expectation of privacy that psychics won't be used to find people and things. Justices Thomas and Scalia dissent, saying that because psychics didn't exist in 1791, there is a reasonable expectation of privacy under the the Fourth Amendment.   Telepaths are a whole different bag of worms. They can tell what you're thinking. The couple of quick scenarios I can think of with them raise some interesting questions:   The TP is used to read the mind of the victim of a crime in order to reconstruct the face of the perp. Again, we're assuming that there are no reliability issues, and that this is scientifically proven to be real. I don't see why a valid warrant can't issue on this information. The TP is used to extract information from a perp. This, to me, raises the fifth amendment questions that I brought up before. Technically, the fifth amendment protects against a defendant being forced to testify against themselves, but that includes the right not to give the police information. Where that information can be (forcibly?) extracted from you, it raises a fifth amendment concern in my mind.   I will now go clean out my fridge. Thank for letting me procrastinate a few minutes."

scotus,22yq4z,justcallmetarzan,3,Mon Apr 14 02:12:11 2014 UTC,"The impeachment procedure is not a criminal trial. ""Conviction"" for impeachment purposes only means "" removal from Office, and  disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States."" (Const. Art. I, s.3, cl.7).   The impeached individual may still be convicted in a criminal trial: "" but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law."" (Id.)  More specifically:   if a President pardons himself of all crimes, he gets out of being charged, but he can still be impeached for the crimes that he now can't be charged for?   Sort of. POTUS could, in theory, commit a crime, pardon himself, yet still be impeached. But POTUS could not commit a crime, be impeached, and then pardon himself:   ...[the President] shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.   I don't think the first of the two scenarios above has been tested, however.  The other thing to keep in mind is that ""High Crimes and Misdemeanors"" is a term of art - it doesn't necessarily mean ""felonies and misdemeanors."" I don't know that it's ever been fully fleshed out, but the term of art usually means basically any criminal activity or other conduct that amounts to dereliction of official duties."

scotus,22v0xy,audreyshake,5,Sun Apr 13 14:37:24 2014 UTC,"Someone else put it better than I could:   The reason that the Court struck down the law here . . . . is not that money is speech. Rather, it’s that restrictions on spending money to speak are restrictions on speech, and “money is speech” is, I think, a misleading way of expressing this claim. Just consider some analogies. Would we say “money is abortion”? I doubt it, but a law that banned the spending of money would surely be a serious restriction on abortion rights (whether or not you think that the Court was right to recognize such rights). A law that capped the spending of money for abortions at a small amount, far smaller than abortions often cost, would likewise be a burden on abortion rights, and dismissing this argument as “it is quite wrong to equate money and abortion” would be unsound. . . . Similarly, we wouldn’t say “air travel is speech,” or “computing power is speech.” Yet surely a law that would limit the use of air travel or computers in political campaigns would be understood as a serious restriction on speech.   Eugene Volokh, Money and Speech, VOLOKH CONSPIRACY, June 26, 2006 (paragraphs combined); see also Eugene Volokh, Money and Speech (again)(, VOLOKH CONSPIRACY, Jan. 24, 2010 (“The problem with restrictions on independent spending on campaign speech—a problem recognized by Justices Brennan and Marshall and not just by today’s conservatives . . .—isn’t that money is speech. It’s that restricting the use of money to speak, like restricting the use of air travel or computers to speak, interferes with people’s ability to speak. One can debate whether this interference is justified. But mocking the pro-constitutional-protection position as resting on the notion that ‘money is speech’ strikes me as quite mistaken.”)."

As people have already said, they object to 4 of like 20 possible contraceptive methods recommended by the Dept. of Health and Human Services. HOWEVER, the ""no contraceptives at all"" thing doesn't come out of nowhere. There have been a number of these contraceptive mandate cases all over the country (the Supreme Court is only hearing two of them). Some of the employers in these other cases are Catholic and do object to covering ALL contraceptives and sterilization procedures on their group health plans. While the SCOTUS ruliing on Hobby Lobby (and its companion case, Conestoga Wood) need not address the facts of those cases, there will undoubtedly be an impact on companies that don't want to cover any contraceptives."

I don't think you really believe this. If you do, please confirm that this violates Macy's corporate charter.  I'll also press this point via a hypothetical. Imagine that a Colorado-based entrepreneur decides to open a business selling marijuana (not so hard to imagine). Now, imagine that he wants to name it, ""Bong Hits 4 Jesus"" (a little more difficult to imagine). His neighbor (and good friendbuddyguy) isn't so religious... but he does know his weed.

scotus,21i1or,Im_not_JB,1 point,Mon Mar 31 18:11:30 2014 UTC,"Maybe I didn't make myself clear, maybe I don't understand your hypo. A corporation is defined by its charter, and has rights defined by state law. The state can charter any sort of corporation, of course. Most corporate charters today include authority for ""any legal purpose"" or language like that, so your pot shops would have no problem getting charters.   The question in Hobby Lobby concerns the federal rights that ordinary business corporations can claim, regardless of what their state charters say. Religious corporations created under state laws--churches, etc.--are exempt from Affordable Care Act provisions that require such corporations to provide contraceptives, under regulations issued by the federal agency that administers the act. The question in Hobby Lobby and companion cases is whether a federal statute, RFRA, that extends to all ""persons"" should be interpreted to mean that any corporation at all can claim religious purpose simply because it is a person; i.e. whether the federal regulations are trumped by RFRA. It seems unreasonable to me to say that Congress intended such a result--that any and all artificial persons should have human rights of conscience and religious practice. The Court ought to defer to the agency rule that limits the exemption to religious enterprises, as four of the justices seem to think.   You raised the question of whether free speech and freedom of the press ought to be denied to all business corporations, on the same reasoning. Maybe, but the situation is different there, concerns Constitutional rights. I suggested in brief terms that all business corporations have freedom of speech consistent with their business purposes (i.e. commercial speech) but Constitutional protections for political speech and the press ought to be limited to enterprises whose purposes are dominantly those of the press--i.e. reporting news--which indeed is the basis of the common-law privilege recognized and constitutionalized in NYT v. Sullivan. Owners of closely held corporations get the benefits of the corporate form, especially the limitations on their own liability; why should they be able to endow any sort of corporation with their own human rights, trumping any and all state and federal laws they don't like?"
scotus,21i1or,Im_not_JB,1 point,Wed Apr 2 13:17:36 2014 UTC,"I think my hypo was unclear.   Most corporate charters today include authority for ""any legal purpose"" or language like that, so your pot shops would have no problem getting charters.   Now that ""Bong Hits 4 Jesus"" is a corporation, is it allowed to be a ""religious corporation""? Is it, as a corporation, allowed to do religious things... say, 4 Jesus? (...like how Macy's puts up a christmas tree.) How, then, are you determining which corporations are eligible for RFRA?  At first, we seemed to be delegating RFRA eligibility to state charters... but since that was clearly wrong, you now want to defer to the agency rule. Only this doesn't make sense, either. The agency surely made a judgement in picking which organizations got exemptions, but there's nothing that requires them to make that judgement in accordance with RFRA. They didn't even have to exempt religious organizations. They could have merely let each religious organization which objects make an individual RFRA claim. Then, the mandate would apply to the rest of the religious organizations which aren't significantly burdened.  You're really just writing RFRA out of the US Code, by fiat... unless, of course, you've found a way to magically make all agency rules conform to RFRA before they're actually adopted (in which case, we're still writing RFRA out of the US Code, because the set of cases it applies to is the empty set).  One last hypo: There are some fringe religious groups who think that applying for non-profit status causes the group to be somehow indebted to or more accountable to the government. They would rather just pay taxes and feel as though there are no strings for the gov't to pull. If this type of church incorporates, but does not apply for non-profit status, would it be eligible to bring RFRA claims?"
scotus,21i1or,Im_not_JB,1 point,Wed Apr 2 23:31:48 2014 UTC,"tl:dr. Business corporations under the law of every state must be conducted for the financial interests of their shareholders, hence are not and cannot be religious enterprises, even if they are ""persons"" within meaning of RFRA."

Isn't the whole premise of modern liberal discourse that corporations need to have some sense of morality? Why aren't you arguing that HL is required to drop their wages (which are notorious for being far higher than the minimum wage)?  Worse, you gave up the game in the last sentence. You said they're eligible for RFRA.

scotus,1z4gqj,Runkle87,4,Fri Feb 28 06:49:39 2014 UTC,"My point is that the Court is already open. If you want to make an argument that the Supreme Court should have video you are going to have to address the concern that it would affect the integrity of the argument and questioning while adding something for the public.  The audio of every oral argument is released freely on the internet along with the transcripts and the hearings are open to the public. This isn't a secret court making secret rulings that affect our lives without us knowing. The Supreme Court is already about as open as it can be, its not like the Court is hiding something by not allowing video. So in this case, nothing would be gained by allowing video, and instead we would possibly be encouraging more disruptions."

scotus,1z4gqj,mittington,2,Fri Feb 28 22:06:16 2014 UTC,"Actually this study would suggest otherwise.  I haven't fully read it but here's the abstract:   We posit that Supreme Court oral arguments provide justices with useful information that influences their final votes on the merits. To examine the role of these proceedings, we ask the following questions: (1) what factors influence the quality of arguments presented to the Court; and, more importantly, (2) does the quality of a lawyer’s oral argument affect the justices’ final votes on the merits? We answer these questions by utilizing a unique data source – evaluations Justice Blackmun made of the quality of oral arguments presented to the justices. Our analysis shows that Justice Blackmun’s grading of attorneys is somewhat influenced by conventional indicators of the credibility of attorneys and are not simply the product of Justice Blackmun’s ideological leanings. We thus suggest they can plausibly be seen as measuring the quality of oral argument. We further show that the probability of a justice voting for a litigant increases dramatically if that litigant’s lawyer presents better oral arguments than the competing counsel. These results therefore indicate that this element of the Court’s decisional process affects final votes on the merits, and it has implications for how other elite decision  makers evaluate and use information."

So I'm going to agree with /u/dl1892ab .   SCOTUS has noted several times, in upholding a law, that it was fairly shitily written or didnt seem to accomplish what Congress set out in Legislative history.  But they've upheld those laws as long as they are Constitutional under whatever section of section 8 is appropriate.  If Congress sets out a law saying called ""Americans Against Ducks Act of 2014"" and with a legislative note at the front saying the purpose was to reduce the sale of Duck meat, then it levies a 300% tax on interstate Turkey shipments in clear language, that law might not be relevant, effective, or necessary, but because it's probably constitutional, anything SCOTUS says about ""appropriate"" is meaningless, from a legal perspective."

scotus,1x70nz,pearloz,14,Thu Feb 6 17:41:02 2014 UTC,"This is an issue that has reached SCOTUS many times. If you really want to see a good explanation of evolution of their rulings, I recommend that you check out Justice Blackmun's dissent in Callins v. Collins, 510 U.S. 1141.  He gives a good account of how SCOTUS rulings in other cases (i.e. Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 and Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586) have created a standard that is legally untenable. He also explains how this untenability has led him to believe that the death penalty is unconstitutional (or constitutionally deficient). Notably, he points out that the death penalty needs to be applied consistently and rationally while also needing to be applied fairly. He writes ""Experience has shown that the consistency and rationality promised in Furman are inversely related to the fairness owed the individual when considering a sentence of death. A step toward consistency is a step away from fairness."" Thus, he concludes ""In my view, the proper course when faced with irreconcilable constitutional commands is not to ignore one or the other, nor to pretend that the dilemma does not exist, but to admit the futility of the effort to harmonize them. This means accepting the fact that the death penalty cannot be administered in accord with our Constitution.""   With that being said, I hope you read the opinion, but keep in mind that it is just a dissent to a denial of writ of certiorari, and he is not actually discussing the merits of any case.   New justices will need to take a note or two from this case in order to argue for the elimination of the death penalty, but the arguments for the death penalty remain strong. Most notably, the argument that the death penalty is expressed in the Constitution twice and the argument that the death penalty is a legislative issue remain salient throughout theories of strict constructionism and judicial restraint."

However, flaws exists in any process and I don't believe that we should completely abandon capital punishment.  My preference would be to use capital punishment far less than we currently do and reserve it for more heinous crimes that have a significant preponderance of guilt. The Cheshire, Connecticut, home invasion murders are a perfect example of a crime I believe deserves no other sentence but death.  As the Governor of Connecticut said...  The crimes that were committed on that brutal July night were so far out of the range of normal understanding that now, more than three years later, we still find it difficult to accept that they happened in one of our communities. I have long believed that there are certain crimes so heinous, so depraved, that society is best served by imposing the ultimate sanction on the criminal. Steven Hayes stands convicted of such crimes – and today the jury has recommended that he should be subjected to the death penalty. I agree."

scotus,1t9ilo,XtheXlanternX,3,Thu Dec 19 19:46:20 2013 UTC,"It might be helpful to bring out the constitutional provision that is lurking behind some of these comments, and the question itself. US Const. Article IV, Section 1, says ""Full Faith and Credit hall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. . . ."" This is usually referred to as a comity provision, and is part of the effort to unite the states into one federal republic. On the face of it this seems to say that a civil marriage in one state will be recognized in all the others, but precedents have created an exception for strong public policies, so that for instance cousin marriages that are legal in Vermont are not recognized in New Hampshire (if  have got that straight). Mostly therefore states that don't authorize same-sex marriages also claim not to recognize such marriages performed in other states. Congress tried in DOMA to make a federal rule that same-sex marriages may not be recognized in other states, and that effort is likely unconstitutional, since Congress only has power under Article IV to prescribe procedural rules for what laws must be recognized. There was an interesting case not long ago of a couple who had a civil union in Vermont tried (unsuccessfully I seem to recall) to get their relation dissolved in Virginia. . .  It remains to be seen whether refusing to recognize same-sex marriages is itself unconstitutional, however.  As pointed out in another reply, SCOTUS has so far avoided the question.  The searchable Legal Scholarship Network on SSRN is loaded with articles on these fascinating conflicts, if anyone wants to dig further.  Edit addes: I should have said what probably most will known, that federal courts do have jurisdiction to decide whether a state has violated the provisions of Article IV sec. 1 by failing to honor the acts and judicial proceedings of another state. The point of comity among the states is to allow people to travel and do business across state lines, which the federal courts are supposed to ensure."

States are allowed to have their own laws.  And a state has no jurisdiction to enforce its law outside its borders, so if there is a conflict, it is meaningless because there are rarely situations in which there would be subject matter jurisdiction in both states.

The US Supreme Court handled a series of conflicts of laws cases in the early to mid 20th C (ending around the 1970s), in which they could have ""constitutionalised"" conflicts of laws rules, but rather chose to do very much the reverse. Instead, each state is able to adopt whatever conflict of laws rules it wishes; there are certain constitutional protections on taking jurisdiction (International Shoe); and if a state can take jurisdiction, it only has to have ""minimal contact"" (Allstate - I forget the other party) with the facts of the case to apply its own law.  So, in general getting the right forum CAN lead to a more favourable outcome. This is limited, however, by the fact that there are rarely more than two states involved, and rarely do they have wildly differing substantive rules, and conflicts rules which would select different state laws."

scotus,1su0q7,SheldonNovick,1 point,Sat Dec 14 00:08:27 2013 UTC,"Sounds much like the fundamental question confronting all our legal and political questions in the United States.  How can we, who face a situation divided bitterly along entrenched lines with arguments that seem to go nowhere, somehow induce dialog and compromise?  If you solve the question, please let us know.  As for what might help, my best guess would be to do serious digging in the academic psychology and perhaps sociology literature.  You might find tools that could be of use, although I fear there may be no solution more effective than waiting for the ideologically entrenched to die of old age.  Even that isn't perfect because of the infectious nature of memes, though.  They're incredibly hard to eradicate once they take hold.  An example of a tool from psychology that might help you is priming, using careful word choice or incidental comments to prime the idea of relaxed discussion or the idea of compromise.  It's mind control, but for a good cause, so it's excusable."

The 10th Circuit ruled en banc that the corporations were likely to succeed on the merits so the injunction was granted. Probably the biggest case since it was the hobby lobby case and the cases are collectively being referred to as the hobby lobby case. There is well over 30 corporations all over the country.   The 6th and 3rd circuits determined the companies were not likely to succeed.  The 7th and DC circuit ruled the corporations were likely to succeed.   The last four weren't en banc.

The Court has agreed to hear the constitutional claim that Citizens United governs, and therefore corporations have First Amendment rights, including right to exercise their religion. Sounds bizarre, but there we are. Seems to me this is just a rerun of the original challenges to Obamacare: corporations are not being required to provide contraception, or to eat broccoli, they are required to pay health insurance premiums for their employees, or a tax in lieu of premiums. It is a regulation of insurance not of  health care, and CJ Roberts would seem to have the decisive vote again. But who knows."

This is an individual liberty case.   ACA was an on its face challenge.  This is an as applied challenge.   I also think RFRA is really the more interesting part of the case that requires statutory interpretation and not really the ACA. I really think it's just a statutory interpretation case and really won't reach the underlying constitutional issues. But we will see."

Both clauses, even when in tension, provide some element of the idea of separation of church and state. This latter idea is not the one that is in tension with free exercise."

Response to how I understood your comment (I dont think this is what you were getting at though): It depends on how much weight you want to give to each* clause. eg.  (Personally) I would much rather not be able to say prayers in a town hall meeting than be forced into one religion or another or none at all."
scotus,1q4268,Im_not_JB,1 point,Mon Nov 18 20:50:48 2013 UTC,"You're correct that you don't understand what I'm getting at. My comment has nothing to do with Town of Greece v Galloway in particular. It's a tough case that doesn't have a clear and obvious answer, even after oral arguments. Instead, I'm picking on a small semantic matter that is indicative of a much broader and deeper misunderstanding. The small matter is that 1A doesn't say ""separation of church and state"". That's simply not one of the clauses under discussion.  Now, you're already thinking I'm a wonk who discounts the idea of separation of church and state because the words aren't there. I assure you, I'm not. There is certainly some idea of a separation of church and state. Congress (and the states, via incorporation) aren't able to make a law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibit the free exercise thereof. This is certainly quite a separation!  Next, is this separation in conflict or tension with either of those clauses? Absolutely not! It consists of those two clauses! Those two clauses might have some domain of conflict, but it's absurd to claim that the combination of them, often called the separation of church and state, is in conflict with the free exercise portion in particular.  How does this all cash out? Well, for example, you mention the coercion test. Ignoring the question of whether this test is a good test or the right test (or whether this type of thing is coercion), which clause does this test come from? I can imagine it easily popping out of either clause. Setting up a false dichotomy between ""free exercise"" and ""separation of church and state"" doesn't just ignore the text, it causes us to just casually skip questions about what the pieces actually bring to the table.  We have to intellectually regress substantially in order to hold our noses through half of that article."

The judicial Power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.   Congress is similarly immune from not being paid, and apparently can decide individually who on their staff is 'essential', so why can't the courts?  Also, I haven't seen where it's defined that only functions related to 'health and safety' can be deemed 'essential'. Can you point me to some resources describing these conditions?

Parker. First of all, the use of eminent domain for public use is one that is exercised with restraint, there are series of political procedures one must overcome to even get the idea on the table. http://www.eminentdomainlaw.net/procedures.php these procedures are in place so that the people can discuss and contest the ostensible public uses of the property and the advancing of legitimate state interests. Second of all, the party here is not a private residence, it is a commercial residence. The bar is therefore lower in analyzing whether the use of eminent domain is justified. This fact alone distinguishes the present case from Burman. Thirdly, the facts mentioned about Burman do not fairly characterize the situation, where much of the area was severly blighted, and the health of those citizens a legitimate concern. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berman_v._Parker I think that the public's view of eminent domain is severely warped from misconceptions following the Kelo decision, which mischaracterize the public use doctrine as the government simply taking from a to b without justifying their use."

They embraced summum jus, summa injuria, 'the rigor of the law is the height of oppression' (a major shift from their prior jurisprudence). Rather than apply what the law says, their rulings were based on their interpretation of what would be best for the German society, given the changing circumstances. Their criteria was gesundes Volksempfinden, ""healthy Folk sentiment"".  This was very swiftly exploited by the Nazi regime. Immediately after the offices of Reich President and Reich Chancellor were combined into the position of Führer, the Reich law office began issuing publications arguing for the same summum jus, summa injuria, on the grounds that the state has changed to a National Socialist state... and the law needed to keep up with that. They argued for judges to interpret what was good for the state, considering public opinion, using Volksempfinden, which was rapidly becoming, ""What Hitler wanted."" (...but it usually did have public opinion behind it.)  This didn't just show through by condemning people for crimes they didn't commit (because 'common people would find their ideas subversive'). For an example, they encountered the Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour, which banned marriage and extramarital relations amongst Jews. The traditional understanding of ""extramarital relation"" was sexual intercourse and the like... ""things done behind closed doors by consenting adults""... and this wasn't provable or prosecutable. This was a problem, because the law said it was vitally important for defining the German nation (the folks). What's the solution? Well, the intent of the legislature must win out. They'll just change definitions and let those prosecutions happen.  Again, whether particular judges willingly collaborated or were merely dragged into such interpretive leaps by public (and official) pressure rather than be rendered irrelevant by some questionable act of the Reichstag is contestable. Whether they abandoned the letter of the law for the winds of the spirit of society is not.  Edit: Format"
scotus,1it5e1,bangarang0987,11,Mon Jul 22 15:42:18 2013 UTC,"I was under the impression that Legal Positivism gave rise to the Holocaust, i.e., the judges in Germany adhered so strictly to enacted laws with complete disregard to any notion of what is ""right,"" thereby allowing the atrocities to happen.  By separating lex from jus, the judges attempted to insulate themselves from the idea that they could do anything to prevent what was occurring under the Nazi regime. They specifically refrained from ""Judicial Activism"" and even attempted to use this Legal Positivism as their defense at the Nuremberg Trials.   While the judges did get ""caught up"" in the morality of the time/movement, which can cause problems in today's concerns of Judicial Activism, to say that the law should always be separate from moral considerations and human consequences can (and did) lead to disastrous results.   Finally, Scalia only concerns himself with Judicial Restraint when the challenged law coincides with his personal views. If Scalia is truly a ""Restraintist"", then why did he have zero hesitation in being ""judicially active"" in, inter alia, this last term by overturning the Voting Rights Act, which was reauthorized by an overwhelming bi-partisan majority in 2006?

You can get a good sense of his arguments from The Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy and Legality & Legitimacy."
scotus,1it5e1,bangarang0987,2,Tue Jul 23 02:43:34 2013 UTC,"Schmitt's work is interesting, but it also seems very conflicting to me. IIRC, Schmitt's views changed extensively throughout both his transition into extreme Nationalism leading up to and during WWII, and his life as an international law scholar thereafter. While it is true he did not believe in legal positivism, he also did not believe in ""laws"" or ""norms"" as we generally understand them. Also, his views on liberal democracy seem to lend less credence to me vis–à–vis his attack on legal positivism, for he firmly believed that Hitler, as Führer, was the final arbiter of justice. IMO his critique of legal positivism was less concerned with strict adherence to laws for law's sake; rather, he did not agree with the source of those laws and the entire process by which modern society deems what is just."
scotus,1it5e1,MYGODWHATHAVEIDONE,1 point,Tue Jul 23 04:31:33 2013 UTC,"he also did not believe in ""laws"" or ""norms"" as we generally understand them.   I don't know if I can agree with this. His focus was constitutional and international law, not domestic statutory law.  It's true that he did not think that an ostensibly depoliticized set of statutory laws could ever be sustainable without political intervention, making the liberal dream of an apolitical rule-of-law a vain project. He did also think that the concrete decree of the sovereign would be necessary in exceptional political circumstances where rule-of-law had failed.  I think he would argue that he had a better grasp of the operation of norms underlying law than the liberal jurists did. The main thrust of his work was against what he saw as the depoliticization of law and politics by liberals, resulting in a state/constitution unable to speak up in defense of itself.  Liberal norms of parliamentarism allowed anti-constitutional parties (bolsheviks and national socialists) places in power despite using extra-parliamentary means to attacks the constitutional order and identity of the state.  But the liberal constitution couldn't ban the anti-constitutional parties to defend itself.  Further, in his post-war book Nomos of the Earth he attempts to demonstrate the normative and geopolitical foundations behind international law, again trying to show that these rules had a historical context rooted in norms and power—international law was not a depoliticized set of practical or universalistic rules.   his views on liberal democracy seem to lend less credence to me vis–à–vis his attack on legal positivism, for he firmly believed that Hitler, as Führer, was the final arbiter of justice.   His ideas justifying dictatorship weren't specific to Hitler and it seems pretty clear that he did not like National Socialism. The problem with Schmitt's ideas is that the problem he's seeking to solve looks almost identical to the solution he puts forward to obviate the problem. His fear is that one of the anti-parliamentary parties (bolsheviks and national socialists) will seize enough power in parliament that it will then begin to ban other parties and then revise the constitution to change Weimar from a parliamentary state to a state with a different identity (communist, fascist, etc).  His solution is for the conservatives (to whom he was an adviser) to take dictatorial powers (based on Schmitt's controversial reading of the Weimar constitution) and ban the anti-constitutional parties until the crisis that they'd caused was put down.  Unfortunately the conservatives, rather than taking dictatorial powers themselves and banning the bolsheviks and national socialists, instead gave the dictatorial powers to restore order to Hitler.  Schmitt laid the legal/juridical groundwork justifying dictatorship (Political Theology, Concept of the Political, The Dictator, Crisis…, Legality & Legitimacy etc), but the dictator ultimately came from the anti-constitutional party instead of the conservatives."
scotus,1it5e1,Im_not_JB,3,Tue Jul 23 17:19:37 2013 UTC,"You're right that the positivist school had some strength at that time. It's very tempting to look back on this period and think only in terms of Augustine (as the undergrad paper you linked to does). It packages the whole thing into blaming a few bad apples and allows us to safely think that society and public opinion can never be Literally Hitler.  I think you're right on Schmitt. He changed his views a lot, but critically developed the interplay between the 'will of the people' and the 'will of the state'. This can be a jumping off point in either direction. Both positivists and non-positivists alike can be swayed in their jurisprudence by the identification of the former with the latter. Consider Huber, who said that it was ""impossible to measure the laws of the Führer against a higher concept of law"", because ""in the Führer the essential principles of the Volk come into manifestation"". Is that a positivist view or an anti-positivist view? It's probably amenable to either.  I think the question people want to answer is: what caused it? Positivists and anti-positivists existed. Both seemed amenable to the catastrophe. Sure, the positivists rejected Western natural law, but so did the anti-positivists (consider Smend's 'constituionalism', for example). Since both groups opposed natural law, it seems arbitrary to pick one of them, set it opposed to natural law, and then declare, ""See! They separated lex from jus (i.e., didn't buy into natural law... whether they tied it to only lex or Volks-Nomos)! It was their fault!""  Of course, don't buy my explanation. Go to the sources cited in that undergrad's paper that you linked to. Start maybe with Ott's paper, ""Did Legal Positivism Render German Jurists Defencelss During the Third Reich?"" Their conclusion?  ""The allegation that legal positivism, and in particular Gesetzespositivismus, was responsible for the legal desolation under national socialism, is demonstrably false. *Gesetzespositivismus had already lost its leading role during the Weimar Republic, and national socialist legal thought was diametrically opposed to positivist thinking.""  Consider ""Legislating Evil: The Philosophical Foundations of the Nazi Legal System"". It says things like, ""Hitler considered lawyers 'defective by nature', and was of the opinion that the foundations of Nazi law lay wheresoever the Volk life or the present time was stirring. As Hitler himself declared: 'The health of the German nation is more important than the letter of the law'... In the Nazi system of domination... the legal system was understood in terms of a progressive order of community life and social evolution. It was not rigid but rather developed in continuous flow... From the beginning the Nazi regime places great stock in the introduction of new principles of legal interpretation as a symbol of their 'new thinking'. Since what really mattered was not the influx of new legislation but the interpretation of all existing laws according to the maxims of evolutionary thinking (and its resulting adaptation to the alleged needs of community), the Weimar Constitution was never formally abrogated by the Nazi regime (Im_not_JB's note: why did legal positivists ignore the Weimar constitution if they strictly followed the letter rather than grasping at changing interpretations?). Rather than overruling the old contitutional order en bloc, the Nazis opted for adopting a method of legal intepretation that deliberately distorted the original nature of the legal system. As Michael Stolleis explains: Disregard of original legislative intent by ideologically guided judges became far more significant in everyday legal life of National Socialism than injustice directly commanded by the lawmaker. And that is why the thesis disseminated in the 1950s - that the judiciary because of its positivist orientation, had been helpless in the face of a legislator liberated from all constraints - contained only part of the truth... Both during the period of the seizure of power and during the war, interpreting the old law under the guidance of National Socialist ideology proved a superior approach than legislating new law. It was faster and more flexible, and in individual cases it could be more easily criticized and invalidated.""  My personal opinion is that positivism is an easy defense and it keeps us from having to think that society can become Literally Hitler. That's why it was actually used as a defense and why it became a popular explanation. However, I think the Historical School of Law probably had just as much to do with separating lex from jus as the positivists did. Furthermore, it's unarguable that the Reich's legal position revolved around the Volk and the winds of popular opinion.  Scalia's purported ""judicial restraintism"" is a different question. Of course, it doesn't seem as though Scalia used the term ""judicial activism"". That's an invention of the headline writer. Most legal theorists now believe that ""judicial activism"" is mostly devoid of meaning, because most people apply it without respect to a sensible or consistent measure.  With concerns to the VRA, I view that problem in terms of Section 3(c). Suppose you're a federal judge, and the executive comes to you and says, ""In accordance with Section 3(c), we want you to put [some jurisdiction] under a preclearance requirement.""  You respond with, ""Sure, no problem. But real quick, I gotta make it look like I'm doing something here. Can you show me some evidence for why I should put them on preclearance?""  They say, ""In 1972, they had low black voter turnout. We rest our case.""  What do you do? Do you seriously consider that to be a sufficient showing of a legitimate state interest? One that overcomes our penchant for federalism? Then, does the mechanics of 'executive asking under Section 3(c)' versus 'legislature saying under Section 4(b)' make much of a difference for the question, ""Is the federal government stepping on federalism?"" If so, it seems to be less 'judicial activism', and more, 'federalism reflex... that sometimes people don't like'."

Yea, sorry about that cited paper; I was on my phone and didn't really search for a source as extensively as I should have. Judicial interpretation of enacted laws can definitely lead to problems. However, IMO it is a necessary evil, which should be employed sparingly. Laws can not realistically encompass every situation which might arise thereunder. Your concerns with the executive coming to a federal judge and ""requesting/ordering"" decisions is extremely valid, which is why I believe judicial independence is paramount. Of course there is a flip-side to that coin, in that there is a risk of judges ""legislating"" from the bench without repercussion. Overall, I believe there are no ""absolute truths,"" everything is relative, and nothing is black and white. We can only attempt to act within the guidelines of our times, hopefully not to the detriment of others/society."

scotus,1iic7t,GrayCosmonaut,3,Wed Jul 17 20:10:22 2013 UTC,"I did, and the basis of the case from the nurse (plaintiff's) stance is that she was discriminated against as a woman; the reason given for her firing was in fact that she was too attractive and the dentist worried he may have an affair with her.  Note the nurse was married, and upon discovering his wife had been fired met with the dentist and received the same explanation.  The breaking point leading to the firing came when the dentists' wife, who also worked at the practice, discovered that the dentist and the nurse had been texting each other, and while there was not anything damaging in the conversations she demanded the employee be fired, they consulted the pastor at their local church who said she should be fired.  To add to that oddity, a pastor from the church was present at both the firing of the nurse and the subsequent meeting with the nurse's husband.  Weird, but good a third party was present to witness both exchanges, though the fact that the third party came from an organization who encouraged the nurse to be fired is worrisome.  Ok, that shit out of the way, the question is does firing a female employee for fear of desiring an affair with her in the future constitute discrimination against a woman, as she wouldn't have been fired if she was a man (another interesting side note: all this dentists' employees are women.  All of them.  Apparently has never had a male employee.  Even hired another woman immediately after).    The initial summary judgement was in favor of the dentist, as the initial court summarized the dentists' reason for firing the nurse was his fear of an affair, not her being a woman.  In the subsequent supreme court hearing, the nurse used a but-for argument, essentially, she wouldn't have been fired, but for the fact she was a woman, which was a precondition for her employer 'possibly wanting an affair in the future'.  Now, herein lies the problem; the precedent that has been established is that it doesn't count as discrimination if an employer fires an employee due to their personal relationship (sexual activities notwithstanding) triggers jealousy with the spouse of the employer.  Now, the mentioning of the 8th court rulings where the precedent came from also make weird distinctions for when title VII does not apply due to consensual sex and jealousy arising from relationships, which I assume to include friendships.  Ultimately, if I have grasped the opinion correctly, the dentist did not discriminate against her because she was a woman, even though he would not have had the situation arise if she had been a man.  The hostile work environment and harassment cited in Title VII were not created, and even though the firing was in theory to 'prevent' the environment from being created, because they did not exist at the time of the firing the dentist did not violate Title VII.  In addition, the precedent exists that when personal relationships of a consensual nature create further interpersonal issues between employees, employers, and the families of either, no discrimination occurs when one or more parties are fired to defuse the situation.  And finally, the fact that all of the dentists' employees are women and the next person he hired was a woman proved that the termination wasn't because the employee was a woman, which undercuts the plaintiff's arguments.  Even if this does go to the supreme court which it probably won't because the issue of interpersonal relationships between employees, employers, and their respective families is just way too messy and shouldn't be touched with a 10 foot pole, the supreme court would probably rule the it the same way, and really they should; employers have to worry about whether they are able to fire an employee when a working environment is threatened by a conflict between the employee and a spouse or any other similar occurrence (son and employee, son of an employee and a spouse, etc).    Our legal system isn't about intent, its about the mechanisms for decision making.  A dentists' wife was a complete bitch and got jealous of a nurse who was too buddy-buddy with her husband, despite them having worked together for 10 years, and coerced her husband with the help of their church to fire the nurse.  In legal terms, a consensual relationship of a non-sexual nature existed between an employer and an employee made a spouse of the employer jealous and forced the employer into choosing between a breakdown of his family and firing his employee; the gender of the employee is irrelevant to the decision, and thus discrimination wasn't a factor.  The court made the legally correct decision, the dentist made the incorrect decision in not being upfront with his wife about his friendship with the nurse and curtailing his wife's jealousy."

scotus,1ianov,GrayCosmonaut,2,Sun Jul 14 20:59:24 2013 UTC,"An interesting perspective. I agree that the claims raised in Bauman would certainly not survive Kiobel, but I'm not sure it's fair to say that SCOTUS is lining up with the business community on this issue - I think that even pre-Kiobel they could have dispensed with this on standing grounds.   So there are two possibilities I see. First, and by far most likely, SCOTUS granted cert to resolve the circuit split RE: agency test for subsidy-parent jurisdiction. Also, ""Dear CA9, please reread your own decision in Doe.""  Second (and wouldn't this pipe dream be nice), SCOTUS will jettison Kiobel's extraterritoriality requirement. While the ATCA as it existed in 1789 is colorably territorial in nature, almost none of the conduct in ATCA cases within the circuits has occurred within the US - stare decisis or original meaning, pick a side. It would present a nice opportunity for SCOTUS to clarify standing issues regarding corporations under the ATCA. The circuits, especially CA2, have been making mistakes in that area since Khulumani (by, among other things, wrongly interpreting IG Farben).   The frustrating thing is that the ATCA is jurisdictional in nature - it doesn't create causes of action. No language in the ATCA limits the courts to cases involving defendants over which they have personal jurisdiction... and if this was the case, Kiobel itself would have been kicked on those grounds long ago. If there is no standing problem for Shell (a UK/Netherlands corp), then there should be no standing problem for Daimler Chrysler itself. The standing issue RE: personal jurisdiction is virtually identical to Kiobel."

I'm not sure where you are getting your facts (maybe from the Dr. Phil show?) but you're mistaken. Whereas, it is true that the birth mother cut off communication with the birth father four months before the baby is due. He was served adoption papers before he was deployed to Iraq to serve in the military (he received a Bronze Star for his duty). The adoption attorneys did this purposefully, but luckily there's a statute that automatically stays the proceedings for service members in this type of scenario.  During the pregnancy, “Footnote 9. Father testified he asked friends  and family if they had seen Mother because she would not reply to his text messages. [Father’s] mother testified she attempted to contact Mother on several occasions and once left Mother a voice message before Baby Girl's birth to tell Mother she had money and some gifts for the baby, including items she hand-knitted, but Mother never returned  her telephone calls.” (pg. 6 of the South Carolina Supreme Court's original decision that was appealed by the proposed adopted parents).  Additionally, when the birth mother gave birth, she was on a ""strictly no report"" status so that if anyone inquired, the hospital would not tell them that she was giving birth.   It is also important to note that this was not ""after the fact"". The adoption proceedings never went through because of the automatic stay that the statutes protect deploying service members. His parental rights were never terminated. In fact, he has been fighting for his parental rights the entire time. He never gave up his parental rights. The document that people have stated that he signed was an affidavit of service, not a relinquishment of rights.   tl;dr the ""adoptive parents"" never had any legal right to the child. this was a pre-adoption proceeding that was stayed because they tried to serve a deploying soldier papers. he never gave up his rights. he actively tried to be in his daughter's life even though the birth mother cut off all contact with him.

scotus,1huf0p,GrayCosmonaut,3,Mon Jul 8 04:29:11 2013 UTC,That seems a bit of a stretch... Who legitimately thought that the state was endorsing a rain god?
scotus,1huf0p,XtheXlanternX,3,Mon Jul 8 06:36:44 2013 UTC,"I agree entirely. But is it so much of a stretch that it's not plausible? I think it could be. The dissent obviously does a more clear job than me to make the same point. Let's look at the parts on Symbolic and Compelled Speech.   Symbolic   Look at the very test the Court doesn't think is a perquisite: ""Spence and Johnson asked whether a symbolic act or display was sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to trigger First Amendment scrutiny...As part of this inquiry, the Court considered two relevant factors: (1) an intent to convey a particularized message, and (2) a great likelihood that the message would be understood by those who viewed the symbolic act or display.""  1) The particularized message in question is cultural and not embodying a ""religious"" element. 2) Upon seeing the image, Mr. Cressman “discerned that [it] depicted and communicated Native American religious beliefs in contradiction to his own  Christian religious beliefs.” Obviously OK doesn't seem to be communicating religious beliefs here but depicting them. Cressman didn't know anything about the image beyond it being Native American.  Cressman needed to do his own research on the sculpture. ""More specifically, he learned that the image depicted a sculpture by artist Allan Houser titled “Sacred Rain Arrow.” According to the complaint, the sculpture is based  on a Native American legend in which a warrior convinced a medicine man to bless his bow and arrows during a time of drought. The warrior shot an arrow into the sky, hoping the “spirit world” or “rain god” would answer the people’s prayers for rain."" Cressman himself proved the second prong false by his own deficit in knowledge on the specific topic and need to research it.  So if Spence and Johnson can't be precedent here how does the Hurley case work? What was the ""point"" or ""particularized message"" that OK was communicating similar to an LGBT group conveying equality in a private parade (The parallel the Court attempts to draw)? ""The Eleventh Circuit has concluded that Hurley “liberalized” the  Spence test such that conduct is expressive if a “reasonable person would interpret it as  some sort of message, not whether an observer would necessarily infer a specific message."" A reasonable person would not see all the uses of Native American culture by state governments in OK, AZ, CO, NM be them on coins, license plates, flags, heritage centers, etc.,  as endorsement of a native american religious message. Cressman's response: ""The license plate image retells this story and conveys a message that promotes ""pantheism, panentheism, polytheism, and/or animism,” to which he objects on religious  grounds. Observers of this image “will understand that the plate  communicates ideas and messages . . . about Native American culture and practices."" Again, I see no endorsement of them. Any reasonable person would know New Mexico uses several different Native American motifs or images in their State Flag, government buildings, heritage sites, etc., because that is their heritage and equally it brings in tourism.    Compelled  I think this is the better argument of the two barely   ""Over three decades later, the Court revisited Barnette in Wooley v. Maynard, a decision that is highly relevant to this appeal. Wooley concerned the constitutionality of New Hampshire’s requirement that noncommercial vehicles display license plates  featuring the state motto, “Live Free or Die.” The plaintiffs, a husband and wife, were Jehovah’s Witnesses who wished not to display the motto because it was “repugnant to their moral, religious, and political beliefs."" The husband had suffered criminal penalties for covering up the motto, and the wife was equally as susceptible to state prosecution. The Court recognized that First Amendment protection “against state action includes both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all.” New Hampshire’s measure forced “an individual, as part of his daily life . . . to be an instrument for fostering public adherence to an ideological point of view he finds unacceptable.”  Requiring the plaintiffs to use their personal property as a “mobile billboard for the State’s ideological message or suffer a [criminal] penalty” implicated First Amendment protections and could be justified only by a “sufficiently compelling” state interest."" Ok so first this assumes there is some ideology being presented. I can buy that New Hampshire is establishing some ideology with the ""Live Free"" motto but I do not think that is happening here unless it's cherish your heritage and respect multi-culturalism. I see no Pantheistic ideology....No one knows what the sculpture is (the myth abou the arrow) unless they research it. This is absurd.  (Assuming they prove the ideology tenet of the argument) There could very well be a compelling interest such as cultural heritage or tourism that would allow the use of the image on the license plate. 3 million ""billboards"" promoting the cultural heritage of OK across the US sounds compelling to me even if it's an ""ideology.""    So is it plausible enough that he can sue? Yeah probably. Do I think it's an endorsement/compelled speech that forces injury in the case of special plates or breaking the law? Nope. Edit: I always have problems with syntax..."

Does she not care or does she not see how devastating to what she cares about a 6-3 (5-4 at best when Kennedy sides with the libs) conservative leaning court would be? Not to mention the worst case (but very plausible) scenario of a 2016 republican president being able to appoint replacements for not only Ginsburg, but Scalia and Kennedy as well (who are no spring chickens either)...

By choosing to stay on at the risk of hurting the adoption of those principles, and, consequently, harming those she has seemingly fought for, she is being selfish.  It's pretty much the definition of selfish to do what you want at the expense of and without regard to others.  Should Ginsburg retire/become ill during a republican presidency, and be replaced by a conservative, would she really be able to look in the eyes of gays and lesbians, the little guys harmed by corporations but can't band together to sue, minorities, women, so on and so forth and say ""I wasn't selfish""?

scotus,1ho4kq,2001Steel,2,Fri Jul 5 02:42:17 2013 UTC,"There is technically a list! Unfortunately it's in pieces and numbers in the thousands. So the Court has anywhere between 8,000 and 10,000 petitions a year. They grant cert. in less than 1%. Also unfortunately, to my knowledge at least, there is no aggregated list for the public. Here are a couple of resources that might resolve your well warranted curiosity.   1) 2012 Term Court Orders. Here you have all of the orders from this year. Let's say you click 6/24/13 and you will find orders in grants of cert. among other things like calling for the views of the Solicitor General (expanded on below). The Court will expand on some of the denied petitions or even add questions to be covered as in the case of NLRB v. Canning.   ""The Solicitor General fulfills his role as the Court’s adviser and advocate by responding to the Court’s invitation to express the views of the United States in given petitions for certiorari. Here, the Solicitor General acts as a special type of amicus because the Solicitor General is not a party to the proceeding nor opining on behalf of one of the parties but rather acting as a sort of 'partner' to the Justices. When the Justices believe that, before they can grant or deny a petition for certiorari, they would like another opinion of the merits of a petition, they 'call for the views of the solicitor general,' known colloquially as CVSG""  (Stefanie Lepore).   2) John Elwood over at SCOTUSblog does a re-list watch section that covers petitions. Often petitions will be re-listed for any numerable reasons. Check out some of the blog posts for more info.   3) SCOTUSblog keeps a Petition section of their blog during the year. Obviously very sparse right now but they will have analysis on some petitions in terms of being granted and denied. I'm having a hard time linking it but if you find their ""Term Snapshot"" Site Map on the right hand side and click ""Major Petitions"" you can see what the Court is delving into next term as well.

scotus,1hnx9s,dangerouslyloose,3,Fri Jul 5 00:23:01 2013 UTC,"I think the issue is whether the level of political powerlessness was comparatively great or small to the level of discrimination the minority faced. You can't forget about that criteria.  Such as it is today, there really isn't a high degree of legal discrimination. I think it's fair to say that the majority opinion acknowledged and despises the societal discrimination, and despises a little less the personal discrimination they face, yet the two by themselves are hardly within the purview of the court. There's not enough of a systematic intent--especially at the federal level--to warrant such scrutiny.  Moreover, whatever discrimination there is seems easily dwarfed by homosexual community's political power. Those particular rights--such as for voting and holding office--have never been questioned or substantially impeded legally, unlike all the other suspect classifications.  To not put too fine of a point on it, even they knew that this is no MLK v2.0. There is some discrimination but not nearly enough to require strict scrutiny."
scotus,1hnx9s,auresilvershield,4,Fri Jul 5 03:01:24 2013 UTC,"there really isn't a high degree of legal discrimination.    Wow. Ok. Uhm. What country do you live in? In the U.S., marriage (a fundamental right, cf. Loving) isn't legal in the vast majority of U.S. states. In 29 states it is legal to fire people for their orientation, in 33 for their gender identity. Just three weeks ago it was reported that LGBT couples face significant housing discrimination. I can keep going for a while.   whatever discrimination there is seems easily dwarfed by homosexual community's political power.   This must be a joke. First, passive and active voting rights are not the be-all end-all for discrimination, and if they were - how many open gay lawmakers do you know? Second, the ""homosexual community"" has very little political power by definition as they are a minority (at most 5-10% of people). Third, whatever forward momentum there has been has been by the grace of allies (those outside the community), similar to other minorities. And until 2012, every popular vote on LGBT rights was a sound defeat for those rights. Political power? Not so much.  Now to answer OP's question:   Why didn't they take it a step further . . .?   I see several reasons. First, they don't want to lose the conservative Kennedy's vote by pushing for a radical change in the law. Second, the closest related form of discrimination is gender discrimination, which receives intermediate, not strict scrutiny (see O'Connor's concurrence in Lawrence). Third, it wasn't really necessary to decide the level of scrutiny because the particular reasoning of Kennedy's opinion made rational basis sufficient. And usually the Supreme Court likes to avoid making unnecessary decisions, especially if they want to let an issue like this develop in the lower courts a bit more."
scotus,1hnx9s,ahalfwaycrook,2,Fri Jul 5 14:54:37 2013 UTC,"There is also the problem of defining discrimination based on ""sexual orientation."" Sexual orientations may be immutable characteristics, but the definition of a sexual orientation is currently in great flux. For example, is polyamory a sexual orientation? If so, then should this receive strict scrutiny? The state could probably give clear harms that anti-polygamy laws prevent, but they would have a hard time showing that less restrictive means could protect these interests.   If advocates can give a clear definition of ""sexual orientation,"" then intermediate review seems to be the proper way to look at these laws. Kennedy's ""animus"" standard already is a form of intermediate review that looks backward at the rationale of the law's formation."

scotus,1hgnkd,GrayCosmonaut,6,Tue Jul 2 00:04:22 2013 UTC,"Very good piece. I'm no brilliant scholar, but the more I learn about Scalia the more he appears to be a true democrat (small d).  I think his idea of American governance is that natural law is something to be decided by the people, and it is sort of a cop out for the people and their representatives to expect the Court to do the heavy lifting.  I think its fair to say that when the founders wrote the Constitution they had racial and sexual and gender biases. I think they also understood that the Constitution they were writing was for them, and that future generations had Article 5. The Constitution doesn't change just because 200 years have passed, it is our society that has changed. We should make those changes in the Constitution explicit through the Amendment process and not devolve the power of the people to 9 Justices.  In other words, I think he's gone on record as saying this: just because something is good doesn't mean it is Constitutional, and just because something is Constitutional doesn't mean it is good. And, likewise, judges have no special insight as to what natural law dictates but rather if anyone is a judge of that it is the democratic spirit of the people -- natural law is decided not by God, priests, judges, dictators, generals, but by the people.  On the other hand, I don't think he's a paragon of pure logical, unbiased wisdom. He is a product of his times, his religion, and his upbringing. He's strongly Catholic, and I believe one of his sons is even a priest. This naturally shapes his judging. I think he's a lot more biased than he thinks he is.    It's very easy for a white, Christian man in America to think that your judgments, thoughts, opinions are the default and unbiased ones."
scotus,1hgnkd,ElisabethvonGutmann,3,Tue Jul 2 18:13:39 2013 UTC,"""With respect to the Defense of Marriage Act, originalism (as Scalia understands it) leads to a clear conclusion: Congress may refuse to recognize same-sex marriages. In his words, “the Constitution neither requires nor forbids our society to approve of same-sex marriage, much as it neither requires nor forbids us to approve of no-fault divorce, polygamy, or the consumption of alcohol.”  Is this position incompatible with his conclusion that affirmative-action programs violate the Equal Protection Clause? Maybe not. In his view, the constitutional requirement of “equal protection,” understood in accordance with its original public meaning, forbids any and all forms of racial discrimination.""  Is the author saying that Scalia would only apply equal protection analysis to claims of racial discrimination?  I don't think I've ever seen anything Scalia has written go that far. The DOMA case applied the rational basis test, so the issue isn't whether only racial discrimination deserves strict scrutiny.   I'm not sure Scalia's interpretation of the takings clause and the 11th Amendment (enforceable rights) can be reconciled with the notion that he's a textual purist.   Interesting article, though."
scotus,1hgnkd,lemontest,2,Tue Jul 2 14:07:51 2013 UTC,"I'm not sure Kennedy applied rational basis in DOMA. He didn't spell it out specifically, but, for example, notice that he didn't say:  ""The federal statute is invalid, for no legitimate purpose exists or is rationally related to the law.""  He said:  ""The federal statute is invalid, for no legitimate purpose overcomes the purpose and effect to disparage and to injure those whom the State, by its marriage laws, sought to protect in personhood and dignity (emphasis mine).""  I may still be in the minority, but I think the federalism thing actually was important for Kennedy's analysis. I was started down this path by this article. I think Alito got it right that equal protection is very slippery. It depends highly on what we're willing to shove into ""similarly situated"". In Volokh's piece, it's clear that his starting point (and the starting point for Cali law) is, ""These two people hold local marriage licenses."" That seems to be the importance of federalism to Kennedy. It's the point at which we're going to pick up our ""similarly situated"" analysis (now, whether you can support justifying any particular point for picking up the analysis... I won't go there yet).  Then, Kennedy proceeds. Given that we're picking up our ""similarly situated"" analysis at the stage of ""holds a locally valid marriage license,"" it seems that the law possesses some degree of animus... and it's that which raises the scrutiny to a point that the justification cannot overcome. He doesn't spell out how much bite comes along with what seems to be another modified rational basis test, but he's putting a bar somewhere above regular rational basis."

It's easy to pick a few opinions from any judge or justice and try and delineate some coherent theory (""Scalia believes in the rule of law,"" whatever that means). But whatever post-hoc doctrinal philosophy is applied to Scalia, the major thrust of his jurisprudence hews closely to the very, very right wing: nearly always ruling in favor of corporations (look to Boyle v. United Tech Corporation for an early 1987 example of this, up to this term's AmEx v. Italian Colors), against the environment (e.g. Rapanos v.

Scalia decided not to recuse himself and there was nothing they could do about it."

Justice Scalia refused to recuse himself, stating    The only possibility [for recusal] is that it would suggest I am a friend of his. But while friendship is a ground for recusal of a Justice, where the personal fortune or the personal freedom is at issue, it has traditionally not been a ground for recusal where official action is at issue, no matter how important the official action was.

I agree with Bernstein that affirmative action in favor of Hispanics should not survive strict scrutiny.

As such, the recently enacted law(s) passed by this state should either be ruled unconstitutional or be sent to the Attorney General for review.""  Kind of using the law when needed."
scotus,1h1gvx,GrayCosmonaut,6,Tue Jun 25 16:25:58 2013 UTC,My initial answer is no. Unfortunately the law now makes litigation much more difficult and less preemptive as it had been before.

scotus,1h1gvx,oneofthosecats,2,Tue Jun 25 17:58:51 2013 UTC,Not at all a moot point. Section 5 had real bite with voter ID and redistricting. Establishing a section 2 violation is much more difficult.
scotus,1h1gvx,geargirl,1 point,Tue Jun 25 18:03:58 2013 UTC,"But, why would section 5 have any less bite in states not previously listed. The only difference is that those listed states were required to get approval from the attorney general. Now, it's on the courts to issue injunctions when citizens/organizations bring lawsuits. I do see your point about redistricting though. Is it possible for someone or a group to sue the state over redistricting?"
scotus,1h1gvx,oneofthosecats,3,Tue Jun 25 18:10:36 2013 UTC,"Section 5 only ever worked in ""covered"" jurisdictions. Those are the jurisdictions defined by section 4 which was just struck down. Section 5 can't do anything until a new formula is created. It's unlikely Congress will.   Section 5 was important in two respects. One, it was burden-shifting. See the difference in the cases for Texas voter ID vs. Ohio voter ID. Second, it allowed a challenge before an election had occurred. Nothing could change until it was approved. This was particularly influential in districting decisions following the census. Section 2 can be used here as well, but it's more difficult."

scotus,1h1gvx,oneofthosecats,3,Tue Jun 25 17:24:59 2013 UTC,"The same way it always was. Preclearance followed a different protocol altogether.  Here are the Senate Report factors used to determine whether there is a Section 2 violation:   the history of official voting-related discrimination in the state or political subdivision; the extent to which voting in the elections of the state or political subdivision is racially polarized; the extent to which the state of political subdivision has used voting practices or procedures that tend to enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the minority group, such as unusually large election districts, majority-vote requirements, and prohibitions against bullet voting; the exclusion of members of the minority group from candidate slating processes; the extent to which minority group members bear the effects of discrimination in areas such as education, employment, and health, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process; the use of overt or subtle racial appeals in political campaigns; and the extent to which members of the minority group have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction."

See  ante, at 18–19. Congress had no such goal in mind when  it added §2000e–2(m) to Title VII. See House Report Part  II, at 2. Today’s misguided judgment, along with the judgment in Vance v. Ball State Univ., post, p. 1, should prompt yet another Civil Rights Restoration Act   For the Vance vs. Ball State ruling, I have to agree with Ginsburg that a big mistake was made by narrowly defining supervisors as those who have the ability to alter employment status (thus not including those who solely dole out responsibilities or provide training).

The Supreme Court usually tries very hard to only rule on the narrowest issues that it possibly can, rather than the opposite.  But, since you asked, yes. They absolutely could issue a ruling such that gay marriage could not be prohibited beginning immediately when the ruling is made public, and it would be effective nationwide.  If we take the broadest case scenario even further...  They could rule that prohibiting an individual person from marrying who or whatever they so choose is a violation of their civil rights, and therefore marriages to rocks, animals, corporations, and even between and among multiple persons, including corporations will be permitted immediately nationwide."

scotus,1gr201,gregbard,-7,Sat Jun 22 05:58:01 2013 UTC,"It isn't about the rocks or animals. If a person decided that they wanted to marry a rock or an animal, then it is conceivable that the Supreme Court would recognize that right.  Laws don't recognize any need for animals or rocks to give consent. Even the laws that prohibit animal abuse are based, not on animal rights, but rather the rights of the person who owns the animal.   If you can own an animal without its consent, then why would they suddenly require the consent of the animal to merely be married to it?"
scotus,1gr201,ctcvalle,3,Fri Jun 21 18:13:30 2013 UTC,"The government doesn't have any substantial purpose in allowing you to marry an object or an animal.  In fact Hollingsworth v Perry touched on the purpose of legally recognized marriage. The state of course does have an interest in regulating marriage, as it does, as an institution that stabilizes communities, promotes the rearing of children (though not always), and commits two people to a stable and cohabiting lifestyle (or at least meant to). The state has no interest in seeing that a man marry a goat, or a rock. It doesn't serve a purpose. While the man can claim that he feels REALLY strongly that he's married to that rock, the government sees no overbearing purpose in recognizing that institution because WHAT POINT WOULD THAT SERVE?  And touching on polygamous marriages: we can see that his almost always leads to issues of Patriarchy and inheritance discrepancies. Take for example the LDS. Many women will marry one man who becomes the dictator of that family unit, and leaves these women (most times) in a submissive and rights-removed state. Islamic Harems also have this problem.  Furthermore, assuming one of the spouses dies, how is inheritance handled? And are all of the spouses married to each other or just the patriarch figure? It presents too many complications to be in the interest of the government."
scotus,1gr201,gregbard,1 point,Mon Jun 24 06:40:28 2013 UTC,"My point is that the Supreme Court has the power to do so. I'm not making a case that it is a good idea. Nor am I trying to make a slippery slope argument against gay marriage. I'm all for it.  However to your first point, you have it backward. In the USA you need a ""serious and compelling reason"" to prohibit something using the law. So the real question is not ""What purpose does the government have in allowing you to marry an object or an animal?"" it's ""What purpose does the government in prohibiting you from marrying an object or an animal?""  Inheritance would be a totally different case, and hypothetically, they wouldn't consider the issue of inheritance for one moment in the course of such a hearing. (my original point was that they usually rule as narrowly as possible). If it were up to me we would have a 100% inheritance tax, on the basis of the simple fact that dead people aren't citizens, and therefore have no rights."
scotus,1gr201,ctcvalle,3,Mon Jun 24 09:27:56 2013 UTC,"General actions are very legal if there isn't an interest for the government to prohibit it. If I want to marry a rock, well dang it, I'm going to marry that rock in a crazy wedding! But like I said, I can very strongly believe that I'm married to that rock but it's not going to serve any interest to the state that I'm married to it so it doesn't give me OR the rock any legal distinction. For me to marry the rock would also raise tons of questions like ""what defines a marriable entity?"" and if I want to ride the slippery slope, anything could be married! But again, I'm not saying it's illegal to tell people I'm married to a rock, but I'm just not legally discernible from a single person for purposes of taxes, etc BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SERVE A PURPOSE FOR ME TO.  And to touch on your second part, we would never have a 100% tax on inheritance because obviously that would create an unreasonable financial harm to those who are entitled to that wealth following the death of their loved one. Would your 100% tax include their pension, IRA Distribution, 401k, Stock, etc? Absolutely not, because obviously in many instances the person still living requires that benefit to maintain their lives, especially the elderly. I'm not saying the dead have rights, but by dismantling their ability to say who gets what in their death is taking away their living rights and the rights of their lives ones! Unfortunately though, inheritance does get pretty hairy during instances of polygamy because there is a lot of contract law that would have to be established for EVERY marriage between EVERY party to that marriage."
scotus,1gr201,gregbard,-2,Mon Jun 24 13:24:04 2013 UTC,"Whoa whoa whoa: ""an unreasonable financial harm to those who are entitled to that wealth following the death of their loved one.""   If you didn't work for it, you aren't entitled to it. Period. Presumably, we live in a society where people can get a job, and pay their own bills. It would seem that even very conservative libertarian types would have no choice but to agree with the 100% inheritance tax. Furthermore, our society would be greatly better prepared to deal with all of these otherwise spoiled rich kids who would then need to get a job. We could pay off the national debt in ten years, and thereafter pay for free education right up to the PhD. level for all Americans. So there really is no crying about a 100% inheritance tax AT ALL.  As far as getting married to a rock is concerned you are correct. If someone wants to say they are married to a rock, there is nothing preventing that. Marriage in its capacity as a legal contract is pretty meaning less insofar as contracts with rocks are concerned."
scotus,1gr201,ctcvalle,1 point,Mon Jun 24 22:26:31 2013 UTC,"I can't tell if you're being serious or not because what you're saying is so blatantly untrue.  First of all, how on Earth would you measure that 100% inheritance? Would that persons pension, IRA, 401k all go toward that? What about their non-liquid assets like their home, car, stocks, bonds, etc? Would the state appoint someone with the Power of Attorney to sell off those assets, then collect the money that those assets provide? The taxes in place are difficult for many people's families let alone a ""100% tax"" that could never be accurately measured anyway. And who's place is it to say who's entitled to someone's assets when they are dead? It should be that persons decision while they are still alive. If this wasn't the case, there would be a ton of deathbed asset redistribution to avoid the state taking it all.  What about where a man and a woman have worked there entire lives to pay off a home, but the home was in his name when he died? What about the military pension they depended on to make it through the month? What about the will he made that said his wife would receive all of his liquid and non-liquid assets upon his death?  And we would never pay off the national deficit with relocating people's assets to go to the state when they die. That's very simplistic and I doubt these death benefits even come close to equalling a fraction of a percent of GDP; so good try. You're also not considering the huge number of elderly who would have to be put into welfare programs to assure that they have funds for food, insurance, etc. Those savings would rapidly diminish. And on the point about the rock. It requires two willing and able parties to enter into any form of contract with one another. The rock has no ability to be willing to enter into a contract with anyone. So no, there can be no legal contract there. I can go around saying ""this is my husband/wife Rocky"" but there could never be any legal distinction."
scotus,1gr201,gregbard,-2,Tue Jun 25 00:55:58 2013 UTC,"I'm as serious as a heart attack. There may be exemption for some non-liquid assets and property. However, there is no reason why the government couldn't use this opportunity to take back corporations via stockholder shares. Every board of directors should have workers and public members on it, and this is one way that could come to pass.   Your disbelief seems ideologically motivated to me. You just aren't able to see things differently than they are. In fact, a society that has a 100% inheritance tax just doesn't have any of the problems you are appealing to.  They are DEAD. They have no rights and there is no complaining about it. Either the society works, or it doesn't. Inherited wealth puts some people unfairly ahead of others for no good reason. No one cries about the penniless not getting an inheritance, so there is no crying for some children of the wealthy not getting their unearned hand out. All inheritance does is destroy equal opportunity. Tell the spoiled rich kids to go out and get a job."
scotus,1gr201,ctcvalle,2,Tue Jun 25 01:16:36 2013 UTC,"Let me make a point. This isn't about the spoiled rich kids. Most people don't make fortunes from inheritance. It does happen, but in small quantity. Most of the people who receive a significant inheritance use that wealth to live the rest of their lives on because their spouse was a large contributor to their well-being. Most times, these are the very elderly who depend on that wealth to survive, often times very frugally. Declaring a 100% inheritance tax wouldn't hurt the rich. They have ways of getting around all that. Foreign accounts, multiple-named accounts, laundering, physical cash, gold, etc. They would be minimally harmed by this. The only people hurt by that would be the poor. If anything, it takes away the incentive to work hard. Your 100% ""inheritance tax"" wouldn't be possible.  AND the last time the government took over a company through stock-holding was in the situation where Chrysler Group faced a credit freeze and had its majority stock purchased by the government and sold to an Italian Automaker (Fiat) for pennies on the dollar. The government doesn't like owning private assets. It doesn't serve a purpose for them to because it presents too much conflict of interest. I don't like the idea of Corporations sleeping with government. We've already seen the consequences of that and I would hope you could look back at 2008 and realize that.  Please find a society for me by the way that has 100% inheritance tax. Even the so-called communist countries don't have anything even remotely close to that because as I said previously, that would be impossible to regulate because you can't solidly define what would be taxed in that situation. A lot of the time liquid cash assets are taxed but only to a certain point.  I don't have a specific prerogative in this debate and it's deviated too much from the original subject so if you care to continue PM me."
scotus,1gr201,ctcvalle,5,Tue Jun 25 04:04:33 2013 UTC,"I just want to expand on this a bit. To OP,  I'm not sure if you've listened to the full audio of Hollingsworth v Perry but if you haven't you need to and really take notes and digest the information discussed in court.  As the previous comment suggested, they're likely going to rule in the most narrow way possible on this issue. Some other state statutes MIGHT be affected but more than likely, striking down Prop 8 won't have any significant consequence outside California law.  That said, assuming the Article 3 Standing issues withstand scrutiny, many legal analysts (and myself) believe Proposition 8 will be struck down as it is in violation with equal protections of the US Constitution.   And I would say that it only violates equal protection for the fact that California already provides many benefits to same-sex couples and same-sex raised children. On the other hand, a state that does nothing for same-sex couples like Ohio, is well within it's rights to deny benefits or marriage to same-sex couples because it never afforded them any rights in the first place. So a separate-but-equal argument wouldn't withstand in court here.  US v Windsor could go so many different ways that I'll wait for the opinion to be released to even begin commenting on the bizarre legalities there.  Edit: I didn't read the last paragraph in the last comment. There is an overwhelming body of evidence for why we wouldn't allow marriage to inanimate objects, animals, polygamy, etc. So little of that is based in reason. Furthermore, the SCOTUS could not all of a sudden declare it unconstitutional to restrict marriage from gay couples in the context of Hollingsworth v Perry. US v Windsor could see that result, but it is reeeeally doubtful."
scotus,1gr201,gregbard,0,Mon Jun 24 06:27:32 2013 UTC,"It isn't. Never said it was.  The question you should be asking is, ""what is the serious and compelling interest that the government has in prohibiting marriage to a rock?""  It's the ""Land of the Free,"" remember?"

scotus,1g7aaj,Philip_of_mastadon,3,Thu Jun 13 17:44:01 2013 UTC,Unfortunately no. We do not know what days opinions will be released. Opinions and their subsequent release are entirely dependent on how quick the judge finishes said opinion. You can make educated guesses which rely on time since argued and how difficult the case is.  The marriage cases will most likely come down the last day at the court due to how close it is.

scotus,1g7aaj,Philip_of_mastadon,3,Thu Jun 13 18:34:16 2013 UTC,All we have is the Supreme Court calendar which states the last two remaining days for opinions are the 17th and the 24th. As we know from last year though they could potentially add opinions day all the way up until recess which I believe is July 1st. Last year the last opinion (Healthcare) came down on the 28th rather the 25th because they added another day. They have to add opinion days at this point so we could have the same situation from last year. Perry/Windsor come down on the 27th.

It is basically permission for an organization to steal 50 cents a month from each of a million customers and not fear any reprisal.    As far as contract law goes between individual contracting parties, the class action waiver is itself meaningless.  Whether you had a 50 cent claim with a class action waiver or without, you still wouldn't bring suit.  But the idea that it could be a widespread practice?

As for the decision, it seems reasonable to me that if evidence if freely available outside the home that it should be able to be utilized warrantlessly. Then again, I could see this leading to murkier water when it comes to more advanced technologies being used without a warrant so I think it's a fair decision."
scotus,1b35sv,sirbruce,10,Wed Mar 27 02:53:08 2013 UTC,"Unlike lower courts, the Supreme Court picks and chooses which cases it wants to hear, something like 2% of cases that petition the Court are heard every year. Given that tiny percentage, one might think the Court would be very selective, dismissing cases which don't meet basic criteria, such as for a lack of standing. Otherwise, one might think the process of selecting a case only to dismiss it on procedural grounds would be a monumental waste of everyone's time.   Further, the State of California refused to represent Proposition 8 and handed that job over to the folks behind the ballot initiative. The issue of standing should have been (and I think was) ruled on back in the 9th Circuit. I do not know how many cases the Supreme Court has dismissed on this basis but one might also get the impression that if it does this, the Court would be suggesting that there is rampant legal ineptitude throughout the lower court of appeals. Not a great commentary of the legal system itself.  Concomitant to that, the implications of dismissing this particular case for lack of standing will, in effect, be saying to States that you can selectively choose which ballot initiatives you want to legally enforce and which ones you want to ignore. Nobody can and will do anything about it. Again, this is not exactly the best message to send to people who organize grassroots initiatives.  The Court chose to hear both these cases and chose to hear them at the same time. To dismiss one on procedural grounds without ruling on the merits of the case or at least commenting on it, is, at best, unsettling. And it is precisely this kind of thing that frustrates the average citizen because it reflects poorly upon the judicial process."
scotus,1b35sv,ignorantwhitetrash,4,Wed Mar 27 12:16:08 2013 UTC,"Finding lack of standing still sets precedent for future cases that don't have standing, ergo they can limit their docket further by sending a message to lower courts which cases it will not hear.  ALSO, it only takes FOUR justices to grant certiorari - the other five can still find no standing.    the implications of dismissing this particular case for lack of standing will, in effect, be saying to States that you can selectively choose which ballot initiatives you want to legally enforce and which ones you want to ignore. Nobody can and will do anything about it. Again, this is not exactly the best message to send to people who organize grassroots initiatives.   I tend to agree with you, however those who support standing would say that there IS something you can do about it.  The Attorney General is an elected official, if you don't like it, VOTE HIM OUT! Also, the Governor might be able to appoint an official to contest it in lieu of the A.G.  Nobody wants to defend it because they see which way the political tide is moving.   I agree that the standing doctrine is frustrating. I think it is even more irritating in the DOMA case.  The executive branch continues to enforce DOMA in the tax code, but refuses to defend the bill in court. Talk about having your political cake and eating it too!"

scotus,1b35sv,Uncle_Erik,3,Wed Mar 27 19:33:29 2013 UTC,"I think if Kennedy will follow his line of questioning and strike down DOMA along federalism grounds, Roberts will join him in order to increase the reputation of the court as well as the historical importance of it. He seems particularly susceptible to ruling along with what he perceives will look the best publicly, as far as landmark cases are concerned. If Scalia somehow finds a good argument somewhere in his inane questioning, drawing Kennedy, Roberts will join them."
scotus,1b35sv,hey_sergio,2,Fri Mar 29 13:13:14 2013 UTC,My prediction is that it's going to be surprisingly high.  Probably 7-2 or 8-1 at worst.  I would not be surprised to see it unanimous with a couple of highly technical dissents so they can play both sides of the fence.  They see the writing on the wall.  Not one of them wants to be the justice that is remembered for suppressing civil rights.

Although he is a bit of a partisan loon, he does have his libertarian leanings occasionally.  I'm betting DOMA will be decided 7-2 with only Thomas and Scalia dissenting. For Prop 8, however, I think it will be 6-3 (Alito, Thomas, and Scalia dissenting) in favor of the 9th District's opinion, meaning the decision only affects California."
scotus,1b35sv,Uncle_Erik,3,Thu Mar 28 14:59:48 2013 UTC,I wouldn't put too much stock in the oral arguments. The justices have a tendency to keep changing their votes even throughout the process of writing the opinions.
scotus,1b35sv,hey_sergio,3,Wed Mar 27 05:54:11 2013 UTC,"We'll be left with a patchwork of confusing and conflicting laws for the next few years at least, but it will be a big step forward for gay rights.   I disagree.  The Court certainly sees this as a potential outcome.  If they rule the way you predict, this issue is going to keep coming back to the Court over the next ten years.    My feeling (and this is entirely opinion) is that they're going to hand down a landmark ruling broadly legalizing gay marriage.  They will never have to deal with it again or have a weak ruling overturned in the future.  Then there's ego.  If you're thinking about how you will be seen 100 years from now (and they certainly think about that) then they want to have their name on a major case that will be read by every law student for hundreds of years.  They also know this is a policy decision and that the public, the President and a good deal of Congress are in favor.  This will be a mostly popular opinion that will reaffirm the value of the Court.  They are sensitive to that and have taken their lumps for the Bush v. Gore and Citizens United cases.  This will be a biggie they can hold up to show that they're essential to the United States and compare it to all the slavery and civil rights cases.  So I think we're about to get broad legalization.  It wouldn't make sense to have to re-fight this 50 times over (and you know the wingnuts will fight it 50 times over), it will give the Court a major PR bump and it'll immortalize every name on it.  My gut says that even Scalia will concur instead of dissent.   What I'm looking forward to is the wailing, gnashing of teeth and rending of garments from the wingnuts.   Edit: Forgot to mention that gay marriage has been legal in a few states for a few years now.  It has caused no problems.  Absolutely none, as long as you're not counting fundie butthurt.  They are absolutely aware of this.  They know that nothing bad will happen if they legalize it, save for predictions of brimstone raining from the sky.  They're going to put this one to bed knowing that in another 5-10 years, they'll be hailed as heros by pretty much everyone."
scotus,1b35sv,ignorantwhitetrash,2,Wed Mar 27 22:03:47 2013 UTC,"The Court seemed to be trying on a bunch of copouts (standing, and ""isn't this just too soon?"") so either they were doing that to illustrate to one another how weak those arguments were or they actually intend on copping out."

But I don't think that will happen with this court with 5 conservatives, 2 being swingers, and most, if not all being strong advocates of standing.

scotus,1b35sv,FatBabyGiraffe,2,Sat Apr 27 03:35:16 2013 UTC,"The judges expressed concern that the federal government may be overreaching when it attempts to regulate marriage in any way, shape or form.

scotus,1b35sv,TezzMuffins,2,Wed Mar 27 19:39:21 2013 UTC,"Sure, but if the taxes are uniformly applied, they aren't regulatory.  I suppose the federal government could make the tax so onorous that marriage is prohibitive.  Hmmm, or you could argue it was like a poll tax.  Do we have evidence of people not getting married because they can't afford the tax burden?  If so, we could see a court challenge in the future."

Via scotusblog:   Implied preemption in a lawsuit over generic drugs is the focus of Mutual Pharmaceutical Co. v. Bartlett, in which the Court will hear arguments on March 19. In 2004, respondent Karen Bartlett was prescribed an anti-inflammatory drug, known in its generic form as sulindac, to ease her shoulder pain. However, in rare instances – including for Bartlett – the drug causes a reaction in which the body sheds skin in large quantities. Bartlett, a New Hampshire resident, lost about two-thirds of her skin, spent months in the hospital, and suffered near blindness and other permanent damage. Bartlett sued under New Hampshire law. After various court rulings (not now at issue before the Supreme Court) narrowed the focus of the lawsuit, a federal jury awarded Bartlett $21.06 million in compensatory damages on the theory that the drug design was defective. Both the federal district court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit rejected the argument by the manufacturer of the generic drug, Mutual Pharmaceutical Co., that state tort law claims based on defective drug design are preempted by federal regulation under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Drug Price Competition and Patient Term Restoration Act of 1984."
scotus,1alw1t,UmberGryphon,2,Tue Mar 19 18:29:27 2013 UTC,"This decision does a lot more than allow for the resale of books from overseas - it may have staved off the extinction of your right to resell things you've purchased that happen to contain copyrighted material.    ""First Sale"" is a defense to copyright claims. Selling something copyrighted usually isn't allowed - but what about used bookstores, and old CDs? First Sale established that it's not infringement to resell a copyrighted work - after the ""first sale,"" the copyright holder loses some control of that particular copy of the intellectual property, namely, the right to sell it. It's why we can resell old vinyl records on eBay.       The Copyright Act contains language that says copies made outside of the United States,  ""lawfully made under [The Act,]"" can be subject to claims of infringement, but also defenses like first sale. The Supreme Court just rejected a decision below that said copies made outside of the United States aren't ""lawfully made"" under the copyright act, despite the fact that they enjoy copyright protection.  This kind of statutory twister is why lawyers can sometimes seem like anal jerks. In plain English, the copies of these books were 'lawful' - they were protected by copyright, allowing publishers to sue people for infringement. But the Second Circuit decided that, for purposes of the language used in one section of the copyright act, books made abroad weren't ""lawfully made under this title.""   That meant the first sale doctrine didn't protect consumers, if they wanted to resell something made abroad that they purchased legally.   The decision told businesses dealing in intellectual property to go ahead and ship as many jobs as possible overseas. Produce your copies outside of the United States, and you can avoid the first sale defense. Produce your copies overseas, and you can sue away. SCOTUS just said ""NOPE"" to that framework."

If someone sells a used copy, the business doesn't make any money - it's a private transaction between two consumers.   Long ago, selling your cheaper, used copy would have been infringement. Only the copyright owner can sell the work. People looking for the textbook would be required to pay the higher price, and the business would profit. ""First Sale"" says that's dumb - you can sell your old books to people, even if the business that owns the copyright isn't going to see a dime.   Under the decision the Supreme Court just reversed - if the book was made abroad, and you sold your used copy to someone else, the business could sue you for doing so. If you're a US based bookmaker, why NOT move your printing presses overseas, and prevent consumers from selling cheaper, used copies when they're finished."

scotus,19l2a4,goldandguns,6,Mon Mar 4 14:02:08 2013 UTC,I think it's an opinion based on no evidence. Which strikes me as being pretty strange for a Supreme Court justice to say while on the bench.
scotus,19l2a4,achoros,2,Mon Mar 4 14:25:23 2013 UTC,"Well, he said ""it's been written about"" so I assume there is some evidence of the phenomenon he cited. It also makes logical sense...surely there are laws that no one will vote against, and not because they're good laws"
scotus,19l2a4,goldandguns,1 point,Mon Mar 4 15:24:21 2013 UTC,"On the one hand, he has a good point, but on the other hand, think about the precedent this kind of reasoning establishes.  To quote Scalia, ""it's a concern that this is not the kind of a question you can leave to Congress.""  Regardless of your view on voting rights, it's a tremendous usurpation of power by the court to decide there are legislative questions Congress can't handle, and the court needs to step in and decide those questions.  On the particulars of the Voting Rights Act, I don't know enough to say anything about how necessary it is today, and whether Congress votes for it to avoid being labeled racist, or because it's an important bill.  However, there are also plenty of subsidies, trade barriers, and elements of tax code that are no longer needed but don't get repealed because it would make Congresmen look bad with their constituents.  Does this mean that the Supreme Court is the appropriate body to repeal these laws?  If he thinks the voting rights act is illegal currently for reasons of infringing unnecessarily on the rights of states then that's fine, but if this kind of language is used to justify the decision it opens a huge can of worms.  Even if the court could appropriately take on this type of role in the legislative process, as Congress' secret honest opinion, how would it determine what laws Congress passes because it wants to, and what laws it passes because it doesn't want people to think poorly about it."

In your hypothetical, Y and Z are validly married according to Kentucky, and Y has committed the crime of bigamy according to New York. If Y lives elsewhere but Kentucky, Y's state of domicile would have to determine the status of each marriage according to its public policy. If the state validates Y's marriage to Z, then Y and Z will be married under federal law.

scotus,19hdwz,ignorantwhitetrash,1 point,Sat Mar 2 16:11:11 2013 UTC,"I'm almost certain this would be bigamy.  I have seen anyone accused of bigamy, but your hypo is pretty straightforward.  For example, Colorado's bigamy statute provides: (1) Any married person who, while still married, marries or cohabits in this state with another commits bigamy, unless as an affirmative defense it appears that at the time of the cohabitation or subsequent marriage:  Whether the other state's marriage would be valid under the prosecuting state's own law is irrelevant to the legal question presented."

I was absolutely floored that he would make such a statement from the bench.  Chief Justice Roberts recognized how awkward it was and tried to make a joke right afterwards, pointing out that there wasn't a question to answer...I'm pretty sure I accidentally touched Jesse Jackson's ding-a-ling too.

scotus,19c4q5,DocFreeman,4,Wed Feb 27 18:28:53 2013 UTC,"Here's the excerpt from the transcript:  JUSTICE SCALIA:   Well, maybe it was making that judgment, Mr. Verrilli. But that's -- that's a problem that I have. This Court doesn't like to get involved in -- in racial questions such as this one. It's something that can be left -- left to Congress.  The problem here, however, is suggested by the comment I made earlier, that the initial enactment of this legislation in a -- in a time when the need for it was so much more abundantly clear was -- in the Senate, there -- it was double-digits against it. And that was only a 5-year term.  Then, it is reenacted 5 years later, again for a 5-year term. Double-digits against it in the Senate. Then it was reenacted for 7 years. Single digits against it. Then enacted for 25 years, 8 Senate votes against it.  And this last enactment, not a single vote in the Senate against it. And the House is pretty much the same. Now, I don't think that's attributable to the fact that it is so much clearer now that we need this. I think it is attributable, very likely attributable, to a phenomenon that is called perpetuation of racial entitlement. It's been written about. Whenever a society adopts racial entitlements, it is very difficult to get out of them through the normal political processes.  I don't think there is anything to be gained by any Senator to vote against continuation of this act. And I am fairly confident it will be reenacted in perpetuity unless -- unless a court can say it does not comport with the Constitution. You have to show, when you are treating different States differently, that there's a good reason for it.  That's the -- that's the concern that those of us who -- who have some questions about this statute have. It's -- it's a concern that this is not the kind of a question you can leave to Congress. There are certain districts in the House that are black districts by law just about now. And even the Virginia Senators, they have no interest in voting against this. The State government is not their government, and they are going to lose -- they are going to lose votes if they do not reenact the Voting Rights Act.   Even the name of it is wonderful: The Voting Rights Act. Who is going to vote against that in the future?"

Partisan vote very clearly the product of Citizens United-era lobbying?  Scalia says: ""This is the will of the people.  It would be judicial activism to interfere"".  Unanimous vote?

scotus,19c4q5,fedsneighbor,1 point,Fri Mar 1 17:39:50 2013 UTC,"The issue in Medellin had to do with whether the United States was bound by an ICJ decision interpreting a pertinent provision of a treaty that designated the ICJ as the final arbiter and interpreter of the provision's meaning.  If the treaty had been interpreted as the ICJ decided it should be interpreted, then Texas would have had no right to execute Medellin.  Roberts (whose opinion Scalia joined) reasoned that ICJ decisions had no bearing on the Court, even though the Court was interpreting a treaty that explicitly designated interpretive authority to the ICJ.  Now we have Scalia saying that some Israeli policy regarding entirely different proceedings is evidence that unanimous legislative action should be inherently suspect.  It's mind-bogglingly inconsistent.  Your attempted snark was pretty foolish, in light of the facts."

scotus,19c4q5,fedsneighbor,1 point,Sat Mar 2 02:47:06 2013 UTC,"I think there is nothing wrong with looking to foreign jurists for guidance on problems where guidance is useful.  It's not uncommon for Courts in one state to look to decisions from other states where the first state has little experience applying new legislation that was inspired by the second state's similar provisions.  On the other hand, if the foreign jurisdiction has analogous legislation enacted or inspired by completely different circumstances, then the foreign body's decisions would be less helpful.  I do not think Breyer has ever gone so far as to say that we are BOUND to follow foreign bodies' decisions--merely that it is permissible to look to them for guidance, where it makes sense to do.  ""Originalists"" are loathe to even make THAT concession--unless, of course, it is to support ridiculous propositions like the idea that unanimous congressional voting records are indicia of constitutional problems."

scotus,181eed,peoplekeepasking,3,Thu Feb 7 02:04:37 2013 UTC,"If your a conservative you have to feel good about the case as there are four sure fire votes on the Court who are ready to strike down affirmative action with Kennedy being the deciding justice. Even thought he was in the conservative side during Grutter he has recognized the value of diversity. So if your a liberal there still is hope.   Along with the uncertainty with Kennedy, there is also the question of whether Fischer has standing to sue UT. She is suing for money damages, mostly looking to recoup small fees, instead of injunctive and declaratory relief. In Texas v. Lesage the Court made the distinction between affirmative action cases seeking injunctive and declaratory relief and those seeking money damages. In the latter situation if the government can prove that they would have made the same decision without affirmative action then they are off the hook, which UT did in the lower courts. And its also debatable it UT's affirmative action program caused her loss of money at all.   Another issue is if she is even able to sue UT at all. The law is clear that the 11th Amendment and sovereign protects state official from suits for money damages.  If the Court does decide she has standing and she is able to sue UT, then it comes down to how the justices feel about Grutter and Bakke. While Chief Justice Roberts has had quite a reputation for deciding cases based on procedural matters, the chance to put an end to affirmative action will be appealing especially knowing that this could be a defining moment for the Roberts Court.  As for what I think will happen, I predict that the Court will strike down affirmative action as the chance will be to appealing to the conservatives and Kennedy to pass up, even though I think she does not have the standing to sue and that UT in protected by the 11th Amendment. Also UT has a strong argument that its affirmative action program is constitutional under Grutter."
scotus,181eed,tnevarez,1 point,Thu Feb 7 03:01:19 2013 UTC,"The big issue here is that there are no guidelines for when deference to schools stops, and schools have been kinda rampant in their race based factoring...they consider it way more than they let on.   It reminds me of the AZ immigration case; yes it's ok on its face but it's implementation may kill it quickly. The implementation of AA justifies it being struck down"
scotus,181eed,goldandguns,2,Tue Feb 26 15:51:42 2013 UTC,"My issue with AA, especially in Fischer, is that the state argued they needed to bring in these students, particularly black and hispanic students from wealthy families, so these students could be leaders in breaking down racial barriers, etc. Here is a byte describing what I'm talking about:   The latitude to consider race is important, Garre argued, because a minority student who doesn’t come from a low-income background is “precisely the kind of candidate that’s going to come on campus, help to break down racial barriers, work across racial lines [and] dispel stereotypes.”   So my problem here is that one of the criteria given for understanding when ""critical mass"" has been achieved is that minority students do not feel like spokespeople for their race. However, Texas is implying they are bringing in students in order to speak for their race! So long as they keep bringing people to speak for their race, they won't reach critical mass. Their argument is somewhat circular in this respect.   Obviously the rebuttal here is they have to speak for their race now and the blaze the trail so others don't have to, but I feel this structure enables this type of misstep  Edit: you should also check out the Sanders article on AA in law schools. He advances the mismatch theory of AA which I think is astute. Minorities are admitted to schools in which they cannot compete, sink to the bottom of their classes and often drop out, saddled with debt. There are fewer minority lawyers as a percent of the total than there were before AA. This mismatch would happen to individuals of any race; if a white person who could not get into school A on merit is admitted for other reasons, he likely will not be able to compete with students who did get in on merit. This is especially true in law school since everything is curved."

scotus,14p3oq,thisisnota,4,Wed Dec 12 00:51:33 2012 UTC,"A little background information first. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act,  specifically §203, prohibited corporation and unions from using their own funds to fund election ads within 30 days of a primary and within 60 days of a general election. Citizens United, a conservative PAC, sough to run a documentary that was highly critical of Hillary Clinton before the 2008 Democratic primaries until a US District Court blocked its airing. The case eventually made its way to the Supreme Court in 2008. The Court held:   that §203 of the BCRA was unconstitutional as it violated the First Amendment's protection of free speech.      They noted that the First Amendment does not make a distinction between media and corporations that the 1st Amendment protects associations of people and      that the 1st amendment does not allow for prohibitions of speech based on the speaker.  the decision was based on the holding in Buckley v. Valeo where spending money was deemed disseminating speech. So by limiting coporate spending on election ads Congress had essentially limited corporate speech.   This decision also partially overturned McConnell v. FEC, where the court had upheld §203, and  completely overturned Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, where the court upheld a similar Michigan law.  When overruling Austin the Court made a couple of specific reasons for its overturning:   The major reason was that the Michigan law made the distiction between corporate and union speech. The former was prohibited while the latter was allowed under Austin. The Supreme Court also rejected Austin because in Austin they were trying to equalize speech between different speakers that they had previouly ruled unconstitutional in Buckley The Court also threw out the reasoning that corporate spending had a ""distorting effect"" causing corruption in elections saying that the government had no authority to to determine what was corrupting and that the public had a right to all information and to determine its reliability and importance. This rationale also did not believe that reliable evidence substantiated a risk of corruption so it was not a compelling enough government interest, therefore did not meet the standards of strict scrutiny.  The Court did uphold §§201 and 311, that mandated the disclosure of the ad funder.   the primary problem people have with decision is that it gives corporations and unions more power in elections as they are the ones who spend more on them. It is also argued that since corporations and unions spend far and away the most on elections, the voice of the common man is undermined and will not be heard.  Note: If anyone finds anything wrong or something that i missed please forgive me and provided a correction. I based this off of my understanding of the opinion, so there might be some errors."
scotus,14p3oq,tnevarez,1 point,Wed Dec 12 03:31:04 2012 UTC,"Thanks! This prompts a few questions ( I hope you dont mind)   Does this mean Citizens United changed very little?  It looks, from your post, as if it reaffirmed previous decisions.  The decision doesnt seem to leed to the impact you listed (that Citizens United caused more spending) since the court was only reaffirming the ability of people to spend money.  Why is Citizens United blamed with causing the increase in spending? The court maintained that disclosure was required.  Why is one of the biggest complaints agains the decision that voters dont know where the money is coming from?    I might have more... Sorry :(  Thank you so much!  edit:   How does this decision allow corporations to spend more?  (I know this sounds dumb, I just thought that organizations could spend more to begin with...)"
scotus,14p3oq,tnevarez,3,Wed Dec 12 03:50:07 2012 UTC,"No, I don't mind. The first thing you have to realize is that campaign finance law is very complex, so my answers to your questions might be oversimplified or just flat out wrong. Second, I would also recommend doing your own research on the topic. So now to your questions:   For the most part the decision changed very little little, but what it did change had huge consequences. The decision caused the move to the use of Super PACs and 501(c)(4) groups that are able to collect unlimited amounts of money and they don't have to disclose the donors. This differs from candidate affiliated groups that have to disclose their donors and have donation limits  As you noted the influx of money didn't have the effect that people thought it would. If it did the Republicans probably have done better in the election. And the decision did cause a humongous increase in campaign spending. Super PACs alone out spent the candidates in the Republican primaries.  The disclosure requirement only applies only to candidate affiliated groups. The thing that people are pissed about is Super PACs. Super PACs don't have to disclose the identity of their donors and people are able to donate unlimited amounts of money to them. As I've said Super PACs are how corporations are able to spend more.   I've tried to answer them to the best to my knowledge. I would recommend reading the Wikipedia articles on some of this stuff as it can be very interesting but also kind of dry. And a note to others: feel free to add or correct me. And feel free to ask more questions :)"

I was under the impression that these already existed. I am probably totally wrong (Wiki says it originated here... soo....) I dont understand, I guess, the fundamental difference between a Super PAC and an Individual who accepts gift money and spends it on their own ad.  Like a business advertising detergent, why couldnt this happen before?  Does its subject (politics) change how the message can be spread?   Before the Speechnow decision, did Super PACs pose a real threat?    I think I am just confused to what the decision changed.  Did it create the ""Super PAC"" class?  If so, why was this class necessary if business can already buy communication?"
scotus,14p3oq,eljew,2,Wed Dec 12 14:44:07 2012 UTC,"Citizens United did not authorize Super PACs.  The primary innovation of Citizens United was that it allowed corporations and unions to spend their general treasury funds on election speech.  Nor did the decision have a humongous effect on campaign spending in this election. Corporations didn't spend that much.  The overwhelming majority of big-spenders---your Koch Brothers, Sheldon Adelson, Foster Freiss, etc---are all individuals who spent their personal money on the campaigns.

We examine earnings mobility among pairs of fathers and sons as well as fathers and daughters using both mobility matrices and regression and correlation coefficients. Our results suggest that all countries exhibit substantial earnings persistence across generations, but with statistically significant differences across countries. Mobility is lower in the U.S. than in the U.K., where it is lower again compared to the Nordic countries. Persistence is greatest in the tails of the distributions and tends to be particularly high in the upper tails: though in the U.S. this is reversed with a particularly high likelihood that sons of the poorest fathers will remain in the lowest earnings quintile. This is a challenge to the popular notion of 'American exceptionalism'. The U.S. also differs from the Nordic countries in its very low likelihood that sons of the highest earners will show downward 'long-distance' mobility into the lowest earnings quintile. In this, the U.K. is more similar to the U.S..""  Download PDF http://ftp.iza.org/dp1938.pdf  As people can see perhaps the best thing we could do is try to help all the people who grew up in the lowest quintile make it into a higher one. That used to be common in the US, (hence came the phrase ""American Exceptionalism"") Now the former roles are reversed and motivated, smart Europeans seem to have more opportunities to move up the income ladder than Americans.

I find that reddit (as a whole) seems to be against the death penalty but greatly in favor of vigilante justice (especially in the case of pedophilia, child rapists, and mass murderers) which is a bit contradictory to me.

Perhaps you are also against any and all military and police where state employees are placed in situations where they will be asked to kill a human being?

Personally, I have some ambivalence toward the death penalty just out of comparing an execution to the definition of 1st degree murder at common law. A knowing, deliberate, intentional killing of a human being. The only difference between a murder and an execution is a court order.  Of course, prisons are also hellholes that I don't think a lot of people deserve to be so there's that complication.  So honestly, I'm ambivalent on the punishments given currently by the US Justice System in general, especially when you have the for-profit prisons run in PA and TX which are giving kickbacks to judges which adds bias into the whole equation."

""He (Gore) would have lost anyway if all the ballots were recounted.""   ""Get over it,"" is a standard dismissal of an opposing argument.  It asserts that there is no merit in other opinions or actions.  As such, the statement is condescending.  Scalia went out of his way in order to bring the Florida voting issues to the Supreme Court.  It was well handled by the Florida Legislature and the Florida Circuit court.  Scalia spins with his ""Get over it"" argument by asserting that it's unimportant, like water under the bridge.  Instead, in 1999, he was beside himself that the Supreme Court should control the decisions for Florida.  And that brings me to one final spin.  Scalia is a vocal proponent for the so called originalism in Constitutional interpretation.  In the case of Gore v Bush, the state had all the authority it needed to deal with it's voting issues, but Scalia practically insisted that the case be nationalized.

In the November 2002 judgement, Hill was deemed ""mentally retarded"" according to a lesser standard of ""a preponderance of the evidence"". That standard applies in almost all other parts of the country, yet in Georgia it is considered insufficient to spare Hill's life.  Despite the supreme court ban, Hill has fallen into a legal trap that could send him to his death next Wednesday. Georgia is the only state in the country that requires prisoners seeking to avoid execution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that they are ""mentally retarded""."

Say, for example, that a confederation of Indian tribes creates their own currency AND declares it, not the United States dollar, to be the sole legal tender of their territory. Is that unconstitutional?  Congress has certain enumerated powers under Article I, Section 8 that are explicitly denied to the states under Article I, Section 10. Do these restrictions of the states also apply to the Indian tribes in the interest of preserving Congress' monopoly on such powers, or does their tribal sovereignty allow them to do what the states cannot?"

If they were asked to take the constitution as it currently stands and work from there, then I was also disappointed that no one had anything to say about bolstering protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. The problem there is that the language in the 4th Amendment is already really explicit:   The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,  and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be  violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,  supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the  place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

scotus,w9vzv,brianwc,2,Mon Jul 9 20:17:16 2012 UTC,"Since this Sub needs some lively discussion, I'm going to go out on a limb.  Term limits - The logic behind the average age of people back in 1787... Is that true or has that been debunked on reddit. For some reason, I recall the average life span being so low(38) was because there was a much higher mortality rate for children bringing the average down. Essentially, if you lived past 7 you were set to make it to 45 or 50. Either way, I like the idea of long terms for federal judges. It makes me think that they are able to stick to their guns and not have to worry about re-election. So, if this were to change I think, the terms should be very lengthy rather than 8 or 10.  Cruel and Unusual - I don't know much about this. Her main gripe is excessive periods in prison. My question is would a change really mean lesser incarceration sentences? If the language were to include excessive incarceration, couldn't the modern judges just say ""this isn't excessive."" I feel as if this is something best tackled by politicians with a backbone.  Natural Citizens and President - Yeah. Makes sense. The naturalization process takes a long time and effort. It seems like it's an earned right.  2nd Amendment - I think it's functionally the weakest, but probably the one most likely to impact the most citizens in every day life. In the end, gun control needs a revision across the board, and a constitutional revision isn't necessarily needed to fix the problem.  Monopoly - I agree.   Anyone else want to talk about the rest or just bash me for being an idiot and wrong?"
scotus,w9vzv,ProfShea,0,Mon Jul 9 20:22:24 2012 UTC,"The term limits one for the judges seems to make sense at first blush and I would like to see it addressed reasonably. I also favor a longer term rather than a shorter term for the Justices.  As a naturalized citizen myself I would like to see that ban lifted with the minimum age of being a president (35, I believe) be the minimum number of years as a naturalized citizen before you can be elected. Seems like a really long game to have to play on behalf of another nation.  The second amendment needs to be revisited with more of an approach that we take to driving to be applied to gun ownership. You can have as many cars as you can afford as long as they are all registered, same with guns and it would be great if there was some kind of test that one had to take before being able to be registered."
scotus,w9vzv,alexdelicious,2,Mon Jul 9 20:32:15 2012 UTC,I think hand gun ownership is like that across the country. Isn't it? I'm only aware of being able to purchase a rifle without a permit or registration...

There are some who believe that any restriction of any kind that congress places on arms is against the 2nd and then there are those who believe that arms are to be used only as part of a well regulated militia. And several hundred parsings in between.  To say that I miss the point of the second amendment when I just have a different view on it than you do is not really the best way to foster discussion in a topic thread that is based on revising the constitution.  In my revised version of the constitution, I would like to see the ownership of weapons to more greatly regulated. As part of that regulation I would like to know that those who own weapons are capable of using them correctly. I know that I get noticibly more comfortable with each weapon the more often I use it and when I have time with an instructor I see leaps in my performance.  Owning a gun is a serious responsibility.  I would feel better if more people had the proper training before they were allowed to be licensed."
scotus,w9vzv,alexdelicious,3,Fri Jul 13 03:02:40 2012 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I'm totally in support of keeping guns out of the hands of idiots. The problem is that once you establish that a permit is necessary to get a gun, the government can make it nearly impossible to get a permit; effectively banning private gun ownership.  Washinton DC has basically done this with handguns. The washington times link has a series called 'Emily gets her gun' which shows how difficult (nearly impossible) it is to get a gun in DC. (Video if you're lazy)  Keep in mind that all this is after the supreme court ruled that the second amendment protects an individual's right to use firearms for legal purposes."

Local governments are generally the best places to set the standards of who can be licensed and for what.  NYC level restrictions make no sense for Butte, Montana and Boise, Idaho rules make no sense in LA.  The national level government is at its best when it sets the outermost framework for a law to be filled in at the most local of levels.  This gives us, the lowly citizen, the most power with our vote. You can actually meet a local town council member and talk to them at a local chamber of commerce meeting about your views. Good luck doing that with a Senator.  Almost everyone agrees that there needs to be some restrictions on who owns arms and what kind of arms can be owned.  The difficulty is finding where that line is for all areas of this country."

The current cap on members of the House is set and adjusted in a way that greatly slants the level of influence from the more populous states to the less populous states, greatly diminishing the value of the more populated states.   I would love to see a House that is one representative per 100,000 citizens. This would mean that we would have over 3,000 representatives in the entire House.  One out of every ten would be full-time representatives heading committees and proposing and reviewing bills. One out of every ten would be selected from a pool of eligible citizens to serve a two year term (similar requirements to jury duty). Minimum of one per state regardless of state population All representatives would be required to meet with all other in-state representatives one weekend per month to debate and set agendas. All representatives would meet as a complete body one week every quarter to debate and vote on all bills. There would be a ten year (five election) limit on members of the house. Elections would be yearly with half of all states representatives facing election for a two year term.  This is my first pass at this and is just something that has been on my mind.  Any and all discussion regarding this adjustment to how our house of representatives works or could possibly work is welcome."

I haven't looked it up in awhile, but I think we'd have something over 5,000 representatives if we used the original calculation.  I'm totally in favor of this.  With a two year term, it would be nearly impossible for megacorporations to buy off all of them.  We'd get a lot of new parties and all sorts of healthy influences coming into Congress.  The Constitution should also have some firm guidelines on government accounting.  It is Fantasyland today.  I also want the full faith and credit act applied to state licensing of professions.  I have an active membership in good standing with one state bar.  If I want to get licensed in the state I live in, I have to take the entire test over again and pay another $500+ per year for what's essentially a magazine subscription.

This is more disappointing than just about anything else. Professional licensing is very confusing and should be revisited more intelligently.  I find it hard to believe that an architect licensed in California would not be qualified in New York or a Lawyer in Arizona would have any difficulty in Maryland.  There are hundreds of other professions that could do better than the myopic protectionism that is practice now.

That's the only way I can seem to reach your conclusion.  In some places, only whites had the right to use certain restrooms. Does that mean that the 14th Amendment forbids the states from prohibiting racial preferencing in restroom usage? The 1790 Naturalization only permitted free white persons to become naturalized. Does the 14th Amendment then forbid the federal government from prohibiting racial preferences in the naturalization process? Imagine Congress wanted to shut down immigration entirely for some reason. Literally no one gets in... because disease, isolationism, resource crisis, what have you. It doesn't matter. Would we say, ""You can't do that, because whites once solely possessed that right?"" Whites once had the right to the front of the bus. Imagine a state banned all people from the front of busses in order to co-opt them for a cargo scheme or whatever. Would that be prohibited because whites once had access to the front?  Does this prohibition vary depending on whether your state had this historical situation? Or does one bad apple spoil the proverbial pot?  Given considerations of this type, I find your theory to be incomprehensible. There is not some time-dependence for ""right's previously possessed"". There's nothing in the text that suggests such a historical dependence. It's rather clearly a time-independent test. ""Are these two people similarly situated right now?

No exactly an equal protection command, since what was intended was to create a single unitary citizenship, and blacks had to be helped to be citizens. That was the argument made by Homer Plessy and rejected by the Supreme Court, and also I rthink made by the plaintiffs in SChuette.

It was quite well-written... until you started editorializing in the conclusion. Nothing in the factual section of the article (or in your most recent comment) supports the position you espoused in your post here... unless, of course, you're trying to say that Tourgee was wrong. Is it any better that arbitrary race categories are being imposed by university admissions officials rather than a railway conductor? Surely you're aware of the fact that our population is even more mixed now than it was then, and that such classifications are guaranteed to be arbitrary, right?  Even granting your strange idea that the 14th Amendment was intended only to protect blacks, you still have too many questions to answer.  1) Would the amendment be acceptable if they didn't include race, and instead merely prohibited disparate treatment based on gender, ethnicity, or national origin? If yes, then you're abandoning the political process theory that the 6th Circuit used, because there's no reason we can't make an analogous argument that women aren't able to petition for preferences without repealing an amendment. If no, then your theory of 14A is shot.  2) It's well-known that many Asian groups get discriminated against by racial preferences. Now, suppose that the country decides to pass a US Constitutional Amendment to fix this. Would we simply copy/paste 14A... with the implied meaning being that this new amendment finally covers Asians this time?  3) Should Latino/Hispanics/women/etc. start making plans to support a 28th Amendment that again has the exact same text as the 14th... only this time, applies to them too? (...maybe the 29th if Asians get to it first...)  4) If the general population decided that they disagreed with your policy choices and thought the Constitution should be colorblind, could they pass a 30th Amendment doing it? Could they just copy/paste 14A yet again... only this time, it covers everyone? How many identical amendments would we need to pass in order to abolish racial classifications and government-sanctioned preferencing based on them? If we could do it in just one... and that one would have an identical text to 14A... why doesn't 14A do it?  5) Are Titles VI and VII of the CRA unconstitutional because they prohibit minorities from petitioning for racial preferences in federal assistance and employment?  6) If it came out the Michigan's universities were discriminating against blacks, could the state constitutionally enact Prop 2 with the exact same words?"

I'll just say now that the university officials didn't assign race to anyone, they accepted students self identification. The problem with Jim Crow is that identities were manufactured and imposed. There was no problem with a requirement that the railroads provide separate accomodations, the difficulty arose only when race was imposed and separation required.  Nor do I imagine that the Fourteenth Amendment applies only to blacks. It grew out of the need to remedy the oppression of enslaved people, to whom a race had been assigned, and can only be understood if one understands that a single citizenship was being established, to which those who had been excluded now needed assistance to join. Of course the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments prohibited the construction of any new castes. No one imagined that they would prevent governments from recognizing the heritage of past oppression.   Your other questions all seem to grow out of misunderstandings, but as  I'll have a look at them in the morning."
