SVExchange,3e1p3i,Porygon-Bot,9,Tue Jul 21 07:30:23 2015 UTC,"Hello /r/SVExchange . Letting go is not easy but it is time for me say goodbye.   I just sold my entire Pokémon collection/paraphernalia  (shiny, low to mid tier events and even my breedables) so I won't be able to do any trades, customs request or hatch anymore anymore. I may start over again but maybe in some distant future —ehem 7th generation.  I may not be that active on IRC or here, DD&DT,  but I just want to say that I enjoyed doing breeding and  egg hatching with you guys.  See you on the next Pokémon game and good luck on your breeding projects!"

SVExchange,3e1p3i,solomon7916,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:28:54 2015 UTC,Hello! Would someone kindly check an egg for me? Battle method preferred. Thank you in advance.
SVExchange,3e1p3i,Sandbo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:36:45 2015 UTC,You might have to wait. Looks like I'm the only one on doing eggs at the moment and I don't do the battle method.
