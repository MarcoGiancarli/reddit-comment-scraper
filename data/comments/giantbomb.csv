giantbomb,3e2rk5,IdRatherBeLurking,14,Tue Jul 21 17:02:42 2015 UTC,Jeff was fired from GameSpot. I could provide some resources if you're interested in finding out about it.
giantbomb,3e2rk5,jackruby1123,6,Tue Jul 21 17:23:21 2015 UTC,Please do. Thanks.
giantbomb,3e2rk5,IdRatherBeLurking,17,Tue Jul 21 17:24:48 2015 UTC,"in 2007, Jeff was the head of editorial at GameSpot. He had been on rough terms with the management for a little while, and then made this review. It so happened that Kane and Lynch 2 was running a huge ad campaign on their site, and was livid about his review. Jeff was then let go.   Jeff, along with Ryan Davis, went on to found giantbomb.com. Brad Shoemaker and Vinny Caravella ended up quitting their jobs at GameSpot and joining them. After a stint at Harmonix, Alex Navarro was hired on, but he ended up working for their sister site Screened with Matt Rorie.  Here's a great video of Jeff talking candidly about his departure.  If you're interested in the history of Giant Bomb, this is a decent place to start!"
giantbomb,3e2rk5,jackruby1123,3,Tue Jul 21 17:30:25 2015 UTC,Holy shit what a post! I started listening maybe a year or so before Ryan died but I realize now I don't really know any of the backstory.

giantbomb,3e2rk5,blimeyyy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:59:33 2015 UTC,Giantbomb was then bought back by CBSi in 2012. CBSi is Gamespot's company. It's come full circle.

giantbomb,3e2rk5,TakenAway,3,Tue Jul 21 18:36:47 2015 UTC,But that's the thing! Giant Bomb is about personalities first. Not journalism. Probably why I like them and funhaus more than other video game outlets.

giantbomb,3e2rk5,jackruby1123,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:21:16 2015 UTC,Wait Jeff got fired from Giant Bomb?
giantbomb,3e2rk5,Hippocrap,8,Tue Jul 21 17:24:31 2015 UTC,No he was fired from Gamespot in part for giving a bad review to Kane and Lynch. The publishers of that game had lots of paid advertising for the game on Gamespot at that time so weren't happy.   The person who mentioned MKX is just trolling.
giantbomb,3e2rk5,RhinestoneTaco,2,Tue Jul 21 17:31:19 2015 UTC,"Hasn't he said in interviews since then that it wasn't just the Kane and Lynch review, but that the site owners had been telling him that his scores were too low and were causing backlash with the advertising side?   I got the sense from stuff both he and the new Gamespot people said once the two companies came back together, that Kane and Lynch was one example of a string of things upsetting old Gamespot brass."
giantbomb,3e2rk5,Hippocrap,2,Tue Jul 21 18:44:51 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, it was a series of events that included the whole Kane and Lynch thing.  As editorial director he was held responsible for every review that made it onto the site so I guess management would hold him accountable for anything they didn't like."

giantbomb,3e2ald,dengou,4,Tue Jul 21 13:09:27 2015 UTC,"Alex and Austin could easily replicate the tone of bombin' the A.M imo, but whether or not they would want to revive it is another matter."

giantbomb,3dz4jz,Serrata,8,Mon Jul 20 18:32:20 2015 UTC,"For once, I want a Batman game where I’m compelled to save the day not because of abstract threats, damsels in distress, or a desire for personal vengeance, but because the beauty of Gotham City compels me to protect it. Instead, I’m left for the fourth time with Batman and his playground.    I get this for sure. I think it's especially hard to make a good hero game in which you are compelled to act like a hero for the sake of being a hero.  I know this probably sounds kinda dumb, but I think the closest thing I can compare it to is the emotions of playing Pikmin. When I would accidentally walk my little dudes too close to a bad guy or the water, and they would let out that little gurgle shriek and then die forever, it hurt. It actually made me feel emotionally stung that this was my fault -- those little dudes would be alive right now if I had not been so careless.   I kinda want a hero game to make me feel like that. That the aspects of the town itself, from the citizens to the infrastructure, were my responsibilities, and that the consequences of my actions had negative repercussions."

giantbomb,3dtsgk,sodiumlaurethsulfate,35,Sun Jul 19 22:32:25 2015 UTC,"Contradiction looks like the kind of thing that's perfect for playing with friends, which is sort of the appeal of watching GB do it. I can see why the RPS review was so harsh, because there's perhaps too much jank (and jenks) for one person to cope with.   But I'm glad people aren't liking it 'ironically' - it's rough, but seems well written, it's really well shot on a budget, and it's got a lot of heart."
giantbomb,3dtsgk,inpu,17,Sun Jul 19 13:48:18 2015 UTC,"Totally. Back when adventure games were still common, I usually played them together with my best friend during multi-day sleepovers. It really helps against the frustration about getting stuck that often plagues even the best adventure games, and it also makes you appreciate the humor more if you have somebody to laugh with you.  I think this game is so perfect for an ""endurance run"". It's a game where you're initially absolutely unsure if it's total garbage or absolute genius, so it grows on you and on the BEAST crew while they're playing. A much better fit for such a feature than Chrono Trigger."
giantbomb,3dtsgk,catdeuce,6,Sun Jul 19 15:02:25 2015 UTC,"I'm actually enjoying it ironically and unironically.  The initial hook of Jenks being a fucking Honey Baked Ham drew me in, the ""I love you"" gang sign kept me interested and now I want to legitimately see where this story goes."

giantbomb,3dtsgk,the_three_stans,22,Mon Jul 20 00:29:26 2015 UTC,"I've seen people draw the comparison of Contradiction being this year's Velvet Sundown, and after thinking about it for a bit I have to say it's probably more like this year's Deadly Premonition.  They both came out of nowhere, they both have a irreverently bonkers story, they both have really crazy/un-intuitive control schemes and most of all they're both in on the joke.   Maybe I just have a soft spot in my heart for games that just go for it in a beautifully messy way."

This game is a beautiful mess from what I've enjoyed watching so far. Definitely on the same level as Deadly Premonition and Bioforge."
giantbomb,3dtsgk,HnNaldoR,5,Mon Jul 20 05:32:46 2015 UTC,People should buy it. It's good to see the game devs/actors enjoying seeing others play the game even though these who watch having no reason to play.   But this kind of positive exposure will be good for the game/future games that the team makes.  Its also nice to see gb lock the content behind premium membership so the viewership will be limited so not everyone will just watch but not play.
giantbomb,3dtsgk,melokoton,2,Mon Jul 20 06:40:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I did exactly the same. I bought it knowing that I'll likely never play it myself, but I'm getting so much enjoyment from watching the GBeast guys playing it, I felt like I had to support the developer."

Though I imagine Austin already knows the answer."

I really hope they aren't playing it in that format, as I would hate to see them just randomly start in the middle, both because we have no context for what's going on, and I secretly hope they would play through the entire game if they started from the top. That's one of the things that bothered me about the Dark Souls series: I liked it, but it bothered me not having seen the first half of the game or whatever.  EDIT: Although, re-reading the tweet, it is kinda funny that he said load his last save on this sealed copy, implying a new save, hahaha."

giantbomb,3dr499,skunkboy72,3,Sun Jul 19 18:41:43 2015 UTC,And it's fair. Especially for a new game like contradiction. People won't buy if they watch it for free. They should restrict the amount of people who are able to watch it.   I think the endurance runs are one of the most popular content that gb has produced and Jeff knows that they should take advantage of it.   Some people rather try to do something on the Internet for the 0.1% chance for a change than pay to get quality content. I am a poorish student and I rather skip some other forms of entertainment and save money to pay for premium. It's so worth it especially when it is on sale. It's about 3 bucks a month.

giantbomb,3dcpw3,dengou,3,Wed Jul 15 06:20:43 2015 UTC,I can't imagine a remaster of God of War 3 being an important assignment or even being assigned to anyone at all. There's already a review on the site for God of War 3 does the remaster need it's own review? maybe it's just because I'm not a fan of the series perhaps fans are interested in this review.
giantbomb,3dcpw3,TheGroomOfTheStool,6,Wed Jul 15 14:35:51 2015 UTC,"No one is ever assigned reviews anymore. If one of the duders feels like writing one, then they go write one.   This review also isn't terribly long, for good reason.  And for anyone curious, here's Ryan's review from five years ago."
giantbomb,3dcpw3,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:26:14 2015 UTC,ye I suppose it's good they get to choose although I would've thought as a writer you'd want to get your chops into something a bit different and exciting to write about not a game that's already been wrote about enough already but what do I know I'm not a reviewer and I linked Ryan's too btw :)
giantbomb,3dcpw3,TheGroomOfTheStool,3,Wed Jul 15 15:34:56 2015 UTC,"Haha doh! The link was purple for me and blended into the text.   I get what you're saying. My guess is that Dan was messing around with the Remaster, and it stirred something inside him to write a few paragraphs about it."
giantbomb,3dcpw3,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Wed Jul 15 15:36:20 2015 UTC,"Dan platinumed it, so I'm guessing he just wanted to get his thoughts out on it for (what he thought) were the legions of GoW fans."

giantbomb,3dajqu,dengou,8,Tue Jul 14 19:51:12 2015 UTC,Jeff's radio dj voice is so fucking good! His Kratos bit killed me.
giantbomb,3dajqu,thubbeyo,5,Tue Jul 14 22:38:27 2015 UTC,"I was dying when he started shitting on Dan about Kratos being a good character, and it just kept going when Dan said ""it's because he's so mad!"" The God of War games are great flashy fun, but they're totally sophomoric in every other regard."
giantbomb,3dajqu,bradamantium92,2,Wed Jul 15 01:46:16 2015 UTC,"Totally agree.  If we are going to talk about anger based heroes,  Azura > Kratos."

giantbomb,3dajqu,Hollandjoey,3,Wed Jul 15 02:24:21 2015 UTC,It's been the schedule so far...I fear Dan is underestimating MGS4's cutscene girth. The cutscenes are LONG.....LOOOOOONNNGG. If they buff up episode length they could do it but hour length episodes seem to put them in territory where a video will entirely be a cutscene.

giantbomb,3dajqu,Muffin-zetta,3,Wed Jul 15 15:29:46 2015 UTC,care to elaborate a bit or point at the specific detail they are getting wrong?
giantbomb,3dajqu,Muffin-zetta,3,Wed Jul 15 16:23:59 2015 UTC,I posted my more elaborate point
giantbomb,3dajqu,Yeugwo,2,Wed Jul 15 17:06:11 2015 UTC,"Can you elaborate, I know nothing about the PSP or Vita"
giantbomb,3dajqu,Muffin-zetta,2,Wed Jul 15 16:26:54 2015 UTC,"Well it's just that the bomb crew are not RPG guys, I suppose. The psp and vita have hundreds of some the best RPGs ever made on them. Dan should love the psp it has four fantastic original metal gear games on it. The soul of wacky ass Japanese games fom the ps1 and ps2 live on in tons of original games for both the psp and vita. The fact that they say the best game for it is lumines is the mark of someone who's never even tried to spend any time with the psp or vita. I'm not shitting on the ds or 3ds those are mindblowingly amazing handhelds too. To be honest the pstv is one my favorite consoles ever! I get to play shit tons of amazing vita, psp, and ps1 games on my tv with a dual shock 4 and it has suspend and resume and it's dirt cheap, it's outstanding."
giantbomb,3dajqu,Plan6,5,Wed Jul 15 16:49:16 2015 UTC,"Its useful for you, which is good.  You should write them an email detailing who it would be useful for.  But the GB guys are correct that is not useful for them or anyone who isn't super into JRPG stuff."
giantbomb,3dajqu,Muffin-zetta,-3,Wed Jul 15 18:11:48 2015 UTC,"Well that's not exactly fair, there are tons more things than just RPGs. I'm not going to send that e-mail because it would go like this, ""it's for people who aren't stupid and want to play games. "" the way they act towards the psp and vita is the same way vinny's cousin still thinks the xbox one has all that crazy DRM inside it and You know what that's actually totally fine. I'm defending corpses of dead handhelds here. It doesn't really matter and it never really comes up on the podcast anyways. It's just they are talking shit about something I am very passionate about and it hurts my soul. Very much like how everyone else felt when dan said kratos is a good character, or when anyone hears jeff's opinion on terminator 2."
giantbomb,3dajqu,-MusicAndStuff,4,Wed Jul 15 18:55:50 2015 UTC,"I bought a vita recently, and yeah, it's more of an Indy/PS1 classics machine than anything else. I love it and take it with me everywhere, but it's a limited device compared to the 3DS in at least library size. When it comes to VITA games, the only thing I'm interested in is Tearaway and Persona 4 Golden."
giantbomb,3dajqu,Muffin-zetta,-1,Wed Jul 15 20:14:03 2015 UTC,"You should check out a game called Oreshika. It's 20 bucks and is a turn based rpg just like persona 4, but with the amazing artstyle of okami and the base building parts of x-com."
giantbomb,3dajqu,crackshot87,2,Wed Jul 15 20:20:37 2015 UTC,Why don't you write piece within giantbomb.com? Although personally I think the Vita/PSP was always a middling system with a handful of gems it would be to interesting read your views on it.
giantbomb,3dajqu,Muffin-zetta,-1,Wed Jul 15 22:18:43 2015 UTC,Well if you read the last two posts you have read my views. I got banned form giantbomb years ago because patrick said a simlar thing that got me riled up and you know how the forums were back then. Anyone that spoke out against patrick was banned immediately without question.
giantbomb,3dajqu,Plan6,5,Wed Jul 15 23:01:24 2015 UTC,"Judging by your previously posts on this sub about Patrick, I feel safe is saying they were justified."
giantbomb,3dajqu,Muffin-zetta,0,Wed Jul 15 23:04:44 2015 UTC,"No, i made several threads over severals defending a couple of game patrick was tearing a new one one on. MB the main mod of gb deleted all of them ten minutes after they went up and told me each time. ""The giantbomb fourms are not the place for ""thought of the day"" blogs"""
giantbomb,3dajqu,Plan6,5,Wed Jul 15 23:18:11 2015 UTC,"I generally side with the GB mods.  They have never done me wrong. And if you kept doing it over and over, they are limited it options."
giantbomb,3dajqu,Muffin-zetta,-4,Wed Jul 15 23:22:24 2015 UTC,"Well it was not the same thread over and over again, it was different big blogs about why I thought this game was good and here are some things patick left out or just got completely wrong. To me it felt like ""oh I'm not allowed to talk about videogames on this videogame forum."" It was not till after that I got a bit vile with my incredible hatred of patrick."
giantbomb,3dajqu,MyCoolYoungHistory,5,Wed Jul 15 23:30:44 2015 UTC,"It's my general experience that if people get themselves banned from one of the more civil forums out there, they were probably doing something wrong."
giantbomb,3dajqu,crackshot87,4,Thu Jul 16 04:54:52 2015 UTC,"got me riled up   If you're getting riled up because they don't like the same stuff you do then you might want to step back and examine the situation. I'd suggest going to the Kinda funny guys, they're pretty big on the PSP/Vita there and they're pretty entertaining. Personally I can deal with hearing their views that may not always be in line with mine."

There's a list of things of what you SHOULD start with as a new premium member from multiple sources here and on GB proper, which is of course full of winners. Then you can start the ""pick and choose"" stage of what you're curious about or you remember them mentioning in podcasts and such. Then begins the start to finish of all the Happy Hours, TnTs, UPFs, and all the weird stuff in between in chronological order if you so desire. I also wasn't a premium member when they first launched although I've been a fan since 08 as well, but it was great to finally go back and watch all the stuff I missed that I couldn't watch which was the WM era of premium."
giantbomb,3dabdm,the_three_stans,3,Tue Jul 14 19:28:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's all pretty exciting. I've been watching the new stuff and old stuff together. There's a lot of crap to watch that i'm really excited for!   Also makes me miss Ryan that much more. You can just see his presence fits so well with everyone. Dan is awesome and is a great addition to gb family but there was a certain connection Ryan had, he could cue up some great jokes, make any situation work, he and Jeff could reference fucking like every studio and game ever made. He was a very knowledgeable, funny guy. Those two guys could stream old video games all day and would always find something to talk about without being forced out.   Anyways thanks for the suggestion bud, I'm definitely going to watch all the TnT's, UPFs, happy hours and save those podcast when I game."
giantbomb,3dabdm,the_three_stans,5,Tue Jul 14 22:38:16 2015 UTC,"I can't even fathom going through all the premium stuff now, there's just so much amazing stuff. SO MUCH. I imagine it's like a Robin Williams in Jumanji type situation."

giantbomb,3d7ovb,Alibambam,2,Tue Jul 14 14:45:06 2015 UTC,"Goddamn, I forgot how batshit crazy this game is."
giantbomb,3d7ovb,jhoroz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:50:36 2015 UTC,Did anyone else notice that the stereo audio was flipped? (left >< right audio sources?)
giantbomb,3d7ovb,alpha-k,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:36:32 2015 UTC,Audio was out of sync is all I noticed.
giantbomb,3d7ovb,jhoroz,-9,Tue Jul 14 17:41:54 2015 UTC,"Yean, no. I think I'll be skipping MGScanlon from here on out. I got tired of watching Drew get frustrated with MGS3 and then having to repeatedly look in the camera and assure us he really, REALLY likes these games when it's clear he's just doing it to make the audience happy.   The whole point of this series in the beginning was to see a complete newcomer to these games give their unbiased opinion on them, but it just ended up being Drew validating Dan's love of these games. Having to listen Dan remind Drew how cool everything is got grating and tired really fast. And this is coming from a hardcore fan of the series."
giantbomb,3d7ovb,Darknezz,17,Tue Jul 14 05:46:22 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest with you, when I first saw mgs1 I thought he was playing it up, when I saw mgs2 I was sure he was pretending, no one can be that bad..   Then I picked up the hd collection.. Holy Fuck those games did not age well at ALL in terms of Gameplay and controls. As a total new comer to the series myself, the controls in 1,2,3 have been horrendous but gradually improving. Mgs 4 which I finished a month ago was a Ton better, but still frustrating at times.. I tried out ground zeroes recently and felt they finally nailed the controls.   The thing I've seen with the metal gear games is Everyone's mileage will vary. Some will find it natural, while others will struggle like me or Drew. He is absolutely not playing it up for the camera, in fact his mgs3 run was quite good, with the aggressive grenade tactics and stuff."
giantbomb,3d7ovb,wrebbit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:59:40 2015 UTC,As an aside The 2 and 3 controls got a lot better for me over time. They're not as fluid as modern games but they have their system of working. Something you won't see really showcased well in MGscanlon because its his first run through the games only is how everything works when you've mastered it all.
giantbomb,3d7ovb,jhoroz,-9,Tue Jul 14 14:51:44 2015 UTC,"I think you misunderstand my post. I no way think he's playing it up at all. My problem is his complete lack of honesty that he likes these games. I understand his frustration and that these games can be unwieldly, and if they frustrate him so much then he should just stop playing instead of reassuring the audience that he actually likes them"
giantbomb,3d7ovb,Darknezz,13,Tue Jul 14 06:09:25 2015 UTC,"I think you're way off base, accusing Drew of dishonesty and pandering for the audience. If Drew wasn't enjoying the series, and wanted to stop, he'd stop. He gets frustrated, sure, but he clarifies that he gets frustrated with himself, or with circumstances like Dan not telling him how the revival pill worked in the fight with The Sorrow. I think it's absolutely reasonable to come away from an experience with a game saying, ""Man, that game is rad, and I'm kinda not good at it,"" and I think that's what Drew is doing.  But whatever, you like what you like. As a newcomer, the same as Drew, I'm enjoying being able to experience the games for the first time, and I appreciate both Drew and Dan's personalities as commentators."
giantbomb,3d7ovb,jhoroz,6,Tue Jul 14 06:40:48 2015 UTC,"This. It's not like Giant Bomb is afraid to stop/cancel a series, they've done it before.  Plus it's his first time playing the game, cut him some slack.  I can't speak for everyone but I know every game in my top 5 of all time have infuriated me several times while playing them.  It doesn't mean I hate them."
giantbomb,3d7ovb,o_Oscar,-6,Tue Jul 14 06:47:17 2015 UTC,"I'm just tired of watching Drew getting exasperated. Even if there are elements that he enjoys of these games, they are few and far between long stretches of him getting frustrated. I agree that Dan's terrible advice is partially to blame, but overall, the series has become a far cry of what it was originally supposed to be."
giantbomb,3d7ovb,jhoroz,8,Tue Jul 14 06:57:41 2015 UTC,"""What it was originally supposed to be?"" What? Stroking the ego of some fans who just wanna see someone play through the games like a robot, expressing no emotion at all? The series is exactly what it's meant to be; the first experience of a newcomer to the series playing through the mainline Metal Gear Solid games."
giantbomb,3d7ovb,o_Oscar,-7,Tue Jul 14 07:00:07 2015 UTC,"Noooooooo....it was meant to be Drew giving his honest opinion as a newcomer to the series. If anything, stroking the fan's ego is exactly what he's doing now by reigning in his frustration and exasperation with the games."
giantbomb,3d7ovb,Skytonic,4,Tue Jul 14 07:09:22 2015 UTC,"I never saw the basic premise as anything more than ""Dan, an MGS fan, guides Drew as he plays a famous series he's not familiar with."" I never thought about unbiased opinions or anything like that, but that may be because I was more entertained by the commentary and the reactions to the absurdity of some pieces of story/gameplay.  As for Drew being frustrated while saying he enjoys the game, I think a lot of games can elicit that reaction in players, and the MGS games are perfect examples of that. These games maintain such a nice balance between cool story and anime bullshit to keep you engaged, while also maintaining a good balance between clever mechanics and tedious gameplay (disable all the bombs, heat the key then cool the key, etc.) to keep you from throwing your controller out the window."
giantbomb,3d7ovb,swordmagic,-2,Tue Jul 14 07:10:39 2015 UTC,"Dan explicitly said in the very first episode that the purpose of this series was for a complete newcomer to give his own take on these games and that he'll try as much possible to not influence Drew's opinion and manner of which he plays these games....which he has consistently failed to keep throughout this series. And as somebody who was a huge fan of the series and enjoyed Drew and Dan's reactions, it's gotten pretty tiring, and honestly, frankly quite boring to sit through 90% of Drew being frustrated and feeling like he's being forced to play these games in order to satisfy the fans, and then seeing 5-10% of seeing some genuinely funny and great moments. There are too many lows for me to endure in order to get to the highs."
giantbomb,3d7ovb,nicolauz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:19:00 2015 UTC,"It's clear we have different expectations from the series, and I don't see the flaws you see. What I find strange is that you expected until episode 40 to say ""that's enough!"" I mean, it's understandable if you got tired of the series at some point, but it's a little bit unfair to blame the show for not meeting your expectations, specially since the show has remained practically the same since episode one."
giantbomb,3d7ovb,Quazie89,2,Tue Jul 14 20:05:39 2015 UTC,I am curious to see how well he adapts to 4 since it is more modern 3rd person controls.
giantbomb,3d7ovb,quikcube,-5,Tue Jul 14 06:09:53 2015 UTC,Don't forget 3 is the worst in the series.  Edit: you guys really like MGS3 :p
giantbomb,3dfwr4,steakadventurer,40,Wed Jul 15 23:20:41 2015 UTC,I like him a lot. He's really intelligent and quite funny. Awkward at times. But he's putting himself out there and has fans. Plus his chemistry with vinny and the beastcast crew is great!  Hey OP can you upload a video of yourself so I can judge you? Cheers!

He has a very dry, dark sense of humour, he has a lot of knowledge regarding a lot of topics, and I've seen him help out fans within the community with mental health issues in the past. Alex is a very nice, caring dude."

giantbomb,3dfwr4,smokeholenaruto,18,Thu Jul 16 01:13:08 2015 UTC,I'm getting pretty tired of these threads. /r/giantbomb is not the place to come and shit on the duders.
giantbomb,3dfwr4,IdRatherBeLurking,23,Thu Jul 16 00:17:28 2015 UTC,Maybe if they all weren't such clip on ties we wouldn't have to

giantbomb,3dfwr4,thelastrewind,-2,Thu Jul 16 01:22:55 2015 UTC,No it's the place to come suck their dicks and defend everything they do.   This is a staff love forum. No critics allowed only blatant and blind praise.
giantbomb,3dfwr4,LemonLimeAlltheTime,3,Thu Jul 16 03:09:14 2015 UTC,You're always allowed to criticize the crew here. How the community reacts to that is up to them.
giantbomb,3dfwr4,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Thu Jul 16 03:48:05 2015 UTC,I had this reaction at first too. I got into GB at what might have been the best time. At the time Alex was already in NY doing mostly writing.  Here's the thing about Alex: Gosh darn it if he DOES have a heart. Some of the best moments can be him baring it. Alex is also a fantastic balance for the whole crew. Him and Jeff are great buds and I love hearing them talk.  edit: sentence error- missed a word
giantbomb,3dfwr4,Kidfox70,5,Thu Jul 16 03:51:42 2015 UTC,"You don't seem like such a bright ray of sunshine yourself, OP."
giantbomb,3dfwr4,rnon,3,Sat Jul 18 02:21:27 2015 UTC,"He is my least favorite of the crew, but he does his thing and I'm fine with it. His sense of humor really isn't for me though."
giantbomb,3dfwr4,MrNiceGaius,3,Sat Jul 18 02:24:05 2015 UTC,"he just acts as shitty as possible   I'm not sure where you're getting that from.  He's not my favorite, and sure I can't stand him on the end of year deliberations when he's earnestly responding to joke statements, but acting shitty?  Like he's some kind of asshole?  I just don't see that from anyone."
giantbomb,3dfwr4,alchemeron,7,Thu Jul 16 05:26:08 2015 UTC,"I love Alex, he usually gets stuck with the horrible games and I think that's part of the charm. I wish he covered more shovel ware, but what are you gonna do?   Dont be such a clip on tie"
giantbomb,3dfwr4,jordha,2,Thu Jul 16 15:08:48 2015 UTC,"Alex is great. The site wouldn't be the same without him,"
giantbomb,3dfwr4,Niall1800,3,Thu Jul 16 07:21:01 2015 UTC,Hey op!
giantbomb,3dfwr4,Bedurndurn,2,Thu Jul 16 12:29:46 2015 UTC,"He does kind of have an acerbic voice, but that's not reflective of his actual personality.  Watch this video and tell me you still don't like him."
giantbomb,3dfwr4,tadcalabash,3,Thu Jul 16 08:19:49 2015 UTC,Alex   Who?
giantbomb,3dfwr4,mathpoet,3,Thu Jul 16 17:53:28 2015 UTC,"tbh OP i can get where you're kiiiiind of coming from. I don't think he ""acts shitty"" though. honestly his twitter is really entertaining and made me connect with him more."
giantbomb,3dfwr4,wrebbit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:26:33 2015 UTC,"I agree that he can be a bit overbearing at times (the Rocket League matches especially), but he's a great foil for the rest of the team. There has to be balance somewhere, and the dude's pretty genuine.  I just hope that he can deal with his internal issues someday."
giantbomb,3dfwr4,TheFatalWound,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:55:56 2015 UTC,As someone who has been a fan for the past 10 years it is odd to me that ANYONE would really dislike Alex. On the old Hotspot podcast that Gamespot had from 2005-2007 any episode that he was on was met by threads in the forums requesting him to be a permanent chair. He probably has the best sense of humor of the GiantBomb guys and he has had some of the funniest video reviews. This is a really strange opinion for you to have and I want you to know you are in the minority and you are wrong.
