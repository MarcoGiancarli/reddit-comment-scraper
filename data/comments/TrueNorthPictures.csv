TrueNorthPictures,3cfwhq,weavves,2,Tue Jul 7 20:23:47 2015 UTC,"Rural NB poverty is so depressing. I live in Saint John, and if you go out of town to the east into Rothesay and Quispam it's all big houses and doctors and fancy properties along the Kennebecasis. Go west, though, and aside from the Moosehead mansion you see overgrown trailers, run-down farms, houses little better than shacks. And the further out of the city you get the worse it is. Houses with a half dozen rusted out cars in the yard. Really sad.  And don't get me started on the urban poverty. I used to work at a bar in the north end. Government cheque day meant a lineup for the VLTs. People just throwing away what little money they had."
TrueNorthPictures,3cfwhq,Northumberlo,0,Tue Jul 7 22:23:44 2015 UTC,"I grew up along the eastern coast. Miramichi has become exceptionally shitty compared to what it was before 2007.  Most of the mills shut down, forcing a lot of people to leave the area for work. A lot of people went to Alberta. Now the town is falling apart, a lot of businesses have closed, and the only jobs are the call centers who continually tell you how lucky you are to work there for minimum wage, constant increase in workload, and constant threat of being replaced.  Although the new pay center opened up which is providing the only decent government jobs in the area."

TrueNorthPictures,3bg4y0,GanjaLogic,5,Mon Jun 29 03:44:36 2015 UTC,"Kananaskis is on the easternmost edge of the Canadian Rockies, just west of Calgary, Alberta. A little further west and you're in the famous Banff National Park. The Rockies are vast and are protected by about a dozen different parks.  The only place you could live in the parks would be Banff or Jasper, where employment is mostly limited to tourism and development heavily regulated. Lots of Australians, Kiwis, Brits, and other young people on working holiday. There's a few towns in BC like Golden, Revelstoke, and Nelson south in the Kooteneys. these places have some lingering forestry/pulp/mining activity but are now big ski towns in the winter and tourist centres in the summer.   The Rockies are my favourite place on earth. My advice; don't limit yourself to Banff or the other headliners; they get very busy in the summer, and while beautiful, you can find equally stunning beauty AND solitude in the less travelled corners of the mountains. Jasper is twice as large but gets half as many visitors as Banff. Amethyst Lake in Jasper. Yoho National Park probably has the best day hiking in the world. Glacier and Revelstoke National Parks are right on the Trans-Canada yet few venture past the roadside boardwalks. And south are the Kooteneys which are full of treasures but get little attention compared to the Parks."

I appreciate the practical reasons for that, but it's far less aesthetically pleasing.   I call them hay-turds because they look like the white dog poo from the 70s.   It becoming rarer and rarer to see hay barns these days, and that has profoundly changed the rural landscape,  and not for the better IMO.    Get off my lawn hayfield. ;)"

TrueNorthPictures,36t8q7,I_AM_STILL_A_IDIOT,2,Thu May 21 22:54:03 2015 UTC,Interesting that the French translation refers to it as the 'Battle of England'. Very cool though.
TrueNorthPictures,36t8q7,ItsMeLewisP,2,Fri May 22 01:31:50 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's because ""Britain"" is difficult to translate directly to French, as ""Bretagne"" is a region in France. A possibility would be Grande-Bretagne, but that's not a direct translation either.  http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britain"
TrueNorthPictures,36t8q7,ItsMeLewisP,2,Fri May 22 01:33:49 2015 UTC,"Isn't Grande-Bretagne a direct translation of Britain (meaning the landmass of Great Britain)? I'm actually English... so I better get this right, or I'm going to look a bit of a muppet."
TrueNorthPictures,36t8q7,ItsMeLewisP,2,Fri May 22 01:47:40 2015 UTC,"No, Grande-Bretagne literally means Great Britain. Bretagne, in French, is only the French region of Brittany; l'√éle de Bretagne would refer to the British mainland. The difference between naming conventions is actually quite interesting"
TrueNorthPictures,36t8q7,ThePartyCat,3,Fri May 22 02:10:42 2015 UTC,"(I know we're getting massively off topic here, but...) The different names for different things in the British Isles can be a bit confusing, haha. 'Battle of Britain' and 'Battle of Great Britain' would mean the same thing in English (but not French, like you mentioned). I think the former just has a more memorable name. Great Britain/Britain is a name for the landmass of England, Scotland & Wales.  ANYWAY. Wicked pic, and cool gesture."

If you look closely at the left side of the image you can see land sticking into the water, hard to tell if that the left side of a bay or if it's an Island (maybe Picnic Island?). I'm pretty sure there's also a river running through the forest just to the left of the curving railroad tracks.  Based on google maps I would say it's just about here...There is a pull off of the highway right there with what I bet is the lookout from which I took the pic. Google images comeing up for this exact location also show the same curving tracks with some even have pics of the trains making the climb."

The drive across the Trans-Canada (as in this album) through the southern end of our province is MIND-NUMBINGLY boring. I get it.  BUT!  I implore you, if you ever have the chance, to please explore further north into Saskatchewan. There are over 100,000 lakes here, lots of rolling hills and valleys, dense forest, and just generally a much prettier landscape.  Don't go to Regina in the south (it's like these pictures but with a building or two) -- go to Saskatoon (/r/saskatoon) in the mid-north. It's a gorgeous city with a breathtaking river valley park system and the amazingly beautiful and surprisingly isolated (yet centrally-located) University of Saskatchewan campus.  Don't go to Cypress Hills Park in the south -- it's all right, but isn't much different from these pictures. (And the Alberta side is better, anyway.) Go to Prince Albert National Park in the north, specifically Waskesiu. It is a hidden Canadian gem, and I almost feel bad broadcasting it. It's as scenic and picturesque as anywhere -- unless you really, really love mountains. (We do have hills and valleys, don't let the southern flatlands fool you.)  If all you've seen of Saskatchewan is everything along the #1 Highway, you haven't seen Saskatchewan. We're so much more, believe me."

I just got my camera about 6 months prior to this visit, so I can't wait to go back again and improve upon this picture with what I've learned since then."

TrueNorthPictures,2xy585,mechakreidler,1 point,Thu Mar 5 01:11:21 2015 UTC,"Point No Point:       Point No Point is an outcropping of land on the northeast point of the Kitsap Peninsula in Washington, the United States. It was the location of the signing of the Point No Point Treaty. It was named by Charles Wilkes during the United States Exploring Expedition of Puget Sound in 1841. Named after Point No Point on the Hudson River (which is also called Dietrick's Hook), the point is home to the Point No Point Light.  Wilkes gave the point its name because it appears much less of a promontory at close range than it does from a distance.   The marine climate ensures plenty of precipitation in winter and mild temperatures in summer. There are many productive habitats. The spit itself has sandy beaches with log jams, as well as some man-made structures for boating. Behind the beaches is a large mixed freshwater/saltwater marsh with a substantial shrub component. The waters surrounding the point react to swiftly running tides, attracting many marine bird species. And there is a somewhat sheltered bay as well.

TrueNorthPictures,2wd6z6,le-click,1 point,Sat Feb 21 00:04:01 2015 UTC,Sure. Its in the Lynn Canyon Park in North Vancouver.  It was a while ago so I can't exactly recall how far on the Baden Powel train it was but I will say this. It won't look exactly like this photograph due to the fact that it was raining heavily that morning so the water was quite high. I'm not exactly sure how far up it was but you can get a similar angle from the 6th picture right here which suggests its sometime after the suspension bridge.

TrueNorthPictures,2o6to8,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Dec 3 20:48:27 2014 UTC,"Peyto Lake:       Peyto Lake (pea-toe) is a glacier-fed lake located in Banff National Park in the Canadian Rockies. The lake itself is easily accessed from the Icefields Parkway. It was named for Bill Peyto, an early trail guide and trapper in the Banff area.   The lake is formed in a valley of the Waputik Range, between Caldron Peak, Peyto Peak and Mount Jimmy Simpson, at an elevation of 1,860¬†m (6,100¬†ft). [citation needed]  During the summer, significant amounts of glacial rock flour flow into the lake, and these suspended rock particles give the lake a bright, turquoise colour. Because of its bright colour, photos of the lake often appear in illustrated books, and area around the lake is a popular sightseeing spot for tourists in the park. The lake is best seen from Bow Summit, the highest point on the Icefields Parkway.

TrueNorthPictures,2ltqr0,TheLostCrusader,1 point,Mon Nov 10 03:38:43 2014 UTC,"I call this my Lake Louise moment. I remember seeing my first photograph of Lake Louise in 1964. After that there was something familiar about every shot I saw after that. It wasn't until I visited for the first time in 1982 that I got it. It's a lot different now, but the basic layout was the same. People would come to visit. Walk through the Chateau, and down the path to the lake. Once there, they'd hoist there cameras up, and take a shot.  I use that analogy whenever I come across an shot that looks similar to one I've taken. It doesn't matter who took it first, its the Lake Louise moment when two photographers have stood in the same spot. It happens a lot more than you might think, and it certainly doesn't take away from the beauty of this submission. Great work, really!  Picture all the shots of Niagara Falls, or the  Perc√© rock that you've ever seen in your life. We try hard to get our own unique version, but inevitably someone else has, or will take one quite similar.  Beautiful place for photography. Thanks for sharing. :-)  https://flic.kr/p/6HGXAA"

TrueNorthPictures,2kdc8d,autowikibot,1 point,Sun Oct 26 16:51:30 2014 UTC,"Mount Robson:       Mount Robson is the most prominent mountain in North America's Rocky Mountain range; it is also the highest point in the Canadian Rockies. The mountain is located entirely within Mount Robson Provincial Park of British Columbia, and is part of the Rainbow Range. Mount Robson is the second highest peak entirely in British Columbia, behind Mount Waddington in the Coast Range. The south face of Mount Robson is clearly visible from the Yellowhead Highway (Highway 16), and is one of the most photographed features along this route. Mount Robson was likely named after Colin Robertson, who worked for both the North West Company and the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company at various times in the early 19th century. The Texqakallt, a Secwepemc people and the earliest inhabitants of the area, call it Yuh-hai-has-kun, The Mountain of the Spiral Road.  Other unofficial names include Cloud Cap Mountain.
