milwaukee,3e3t5x,Beastsider,7,Wed Jul 22 04:21:43 2015 UTC,"Best news I'v heard in a while. I have no numbers based evidence, but I believe that requiring city workers to live in the community they serve gives them more of a stake. If you want the higher pay of a Milwaukee City job, you should be ok living in the city.  I also view it as a public safety and job effectiveness argument, if you are an emergency worker, you should live within a reasonable distance of the community you are serving."
milwaukee,3e3t5x,projkt4,4,Tue Jul 21 19:43:11 2015 UTC,"Longtime city employee here and I completely agree.  I love the city and work my ass off for it.  Though the ""higher pay"" of a city job is a bit of a myth.  I'm not complaining about my salary, but the perks of the public sector aren't what they used to be."
milwaukee,3e3t5x,tehpoint,7,Tue Jul 21 23:28:15 2015 UTC,"As someone who has actually worked in the public sector I strongly disagree. The only residency requirements that are needed are making sure people live close enough to respond to on-call situations in a timely fashion, which does not necessarily mean living within the city limits. I can tell you with absolute certainty that living within the city I worked for would make NO DIFFERENCE in how hard I worked or how I felt about it. Actually, depending on the city it would probably lead me to dislike it a lot and thus be less productive because I was unhappy. People are not applying for jobs with the city because they just love Milwaukee so much that they want to work there, it's because they need a job that can support their family better than the one they have at the moment. It's a lot easier to work in a town you dislike than to live in one.  Also, keep in mind that this rule applies to ANYONE who works for the city, including a large number of people with jobs that are menial and/or require absolutely no emergency responses. People should absolutely not be ""owned"" by their employer in anyway - they have a right to live their personal lives how they choose, which includes living where they want (obviously with exceptions for emergency workers and political representatives).  Furthermore there are lots of these City of Milwaukee positions that do not in fact pay as well as or more than other municipalities. So essentially this ends up forcing people to live in less desirable neighborhoods because they can't afford the best ones in the city limits, when they could probably have a better place if they lived a little farther away. Then you also get into issues with people wanting to get their kids into better schools, having a spouse whose commute would be atrocious, etc. Milwaukee has definitely lost a lot of good potential employees because of the residency requirements.  tl;dr I completely, 100%, absolutely disagree with you to my very core on this issue, and having residency requirements with such a well developed metro area where travel is easy is ridiculous and unnecessary."
milwaukee,3e3t5x,meganmcpain,3,Tue Jul 21 22:12:38 2015 UTC,I 100% agree with you.  If I had to live in Milwaukee my home would be a large downgrade and way more crime.

milwaukee,3e3t5x,meganmcpain,-1,Tue Jul 21 22:15:08 2015 UTC,"Outdated? That isn't the only argument here.  Why as a Milwaukee resident should I have an additional tax burden that supports the above market wages and benefits for police, fire, teachers, etc when they can just live outside of the city (paying much less property taxes)?"
milwaukee,3e3t5x,watchoutfordeer,2,Tue Jul 21 23:19:41 2015 UTC,"No, it is not an ""additional"" tax burden. The cost of running the city is the same if those employees are living there or not, and just because those people aren't living there doesn't mean no one else is moving in to take their place, so to speak, to pay those property taxes. Does an employee at MillerCoors have to drink only Miller products just so the company gets a return on its money? No. Do Pick 'N Save employees have to shop at a Roundy's owned grocery store? No, because there are plenty of other people providing a revenue stream.  Furthermore, given that the metro area is so integrated, it's not a great argument to say that none of that money is going back to the city. People come from all over to go to festivals, Brewer games, Bucks games, fancy restaurants, etc. that are all located in the city. That's the whole point here, that most of the state population lives in an area where strict residency requirements are not necessary because different cities - and in our area, counties too - are so intertwined nowadays.  I don't think it's wrong to have limits on how far away people should be living from the city, however I think those should be based on MILES from their workplace rather than being in the city limits. In fact it's is not an uncommon rule to find at municipalities, and some even offer to pay employees slightly more as an incentive to live within their city limits as opposed to just within the mileage limits. Rules like that could be effective in cities and still serve very rural areas too, where it actually would be important to live closer because travel is not as easy."
milwaukee,3e3t5x,meganmcpain,5,Wed Jul 22 00:43:01 2015 UTC,"The benefits you are talking about are mostly sales tax benefits which go to the state and county more than the city, and shared revenue has been declining for years. The more middle class households leaving the city pressures property values downward. So it is an increased tax burden. You're wrong about this one."

milwaukee,3e0pqj,AhoyaWarrior,7,Tue Jul 21 01:42:51 2015 UTC,"UPDATE  Landlord helps ID mystery woman injured in bike crash  By Vivian Wang of the Journal Sentinel    A landlord has helped the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office identify a woman who was involved in an apparent bicycle crash Monday morning at Veterans Park.  The 64-year-old woman, whose name is not being released, was found unconscious on the path along the lakefront directly east of the sailing center. Her bicycle, which was discovered near her, showed damage consistent with some type of impact, said sheriff's office spokeswoman Fran McLaughlin. The bike frame was bent, and the front fork pushed inward so that the wheel could not move freely.  The landlord saw local news reports about the office's request for help identifying her, as she had been found without a phone, wallet, or any other kind of identification. She lives on the east side of Milwaukee, McLaughlin said.   She was transported to Froedtert Hospital for treatment, and her out-of-state relatives have been contacted. No other information on her medical status was available. | July 21, 2015 12:18 p.m."

Lincoln Memorial Drive, on the path along the lakefront, directly east of the sailing center.  The woman didn’t have a phone, wallet or other identification on her person."

milwaukee,3e1jho,Meska04,2,Tue Jul 21 23:13:47 2015 UTC,"Here's a couple reasons for you:  1) People who live in cities don't know how to deal with non-domesticated animals, and they'll do dumb shit to provoke it without being aware of how dangerous it is. Edit: And sometimes unaware that they're even provoking it. Like when you rub a cat's stomach and then it assaults your hand. Hell, just turning your back on a big cat can make it leap on you.  2) Lions can bite down with between 600-900lbs of pressure. That's more than enough to crush your skull.  3) Lions are huge. I don't think you understand just how ridiculously huge they are. They can get upwards of 9ft long and a little over 400lbs. That's goddamn enormous.  4) Literally everything about them was designed to kill stuff. Nevermind that they have claws that can get up to 2 inches long and fangs upwards of 3 inches, just licking you they can tear away flesh. That's what all those rough little spines on your cat's tongue are for. Just imagine those, but bigger and more intent on eating you.  Really, if there's a lion loose in a densely populated area, it's a priority to stop it because the number of people it could kill is incredible. It's a big, irritable killing machine in a place with a lot of sudden, loud noises and people who don't know any better. Leaving it roaming the streets is like having toddlers run a nuclear plant; you're just asking for disaster. If it's a hoax, great, the police can track down the person who called in the hoax and arrest them because I'm pretty sure calling in false reports is illegal. If it's not a hoax, are you willing to take that risk?"

To quote K, ""A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky animals and you know it.""  For instance, you know what you never want to do when you come face to face with a lion? Turn and run. Never turn and run. The instant you turn around that cat is going to fuck you up."
milwaukee,3dyuhj,_TheWhiteWolf_,36,Mon Jul 20 17:22:59 2015 UTC,I agree with /u/poboyfresh. If you're going to go this route you have to at least mention that Lasry is going to raise tons of money for Clinton.   AND he was almost Obama's US Ambassador to Paris.

I get that people don't like the government subsidy given to it, myself included, but unfortunately that's just the way stadium deals work in this country. It's not some conspiracy that Walker gave his fundraiser the stadium as a favor or something. The faces of the Bucks ownership just recently supported Walker's opponent. If this were about political games, Walker would have not wanted this to go through to stick it to them. He just wanted to keep the business in state."

Also a tidbit in this article from Assemblyman Evan Goyke saying he will support the the deal because of constituent support.   “I received far more comments from constituents in support than against.”   There's more tweets I could dig up from months ago if that's not enough for you."

Should we allow posts about Obama's gun policies? Milwaukee is in the US after all. Should we allow posts about Scott Walkers stance on gun rights? It's certainly more relevant, but not necessarily related to ""Milwaukee"" more than Obama's.   Therefore, I think it's a good idea to keep political posts beyond Milwaukee politics to a minimum. If candidates talk about Milwaukee, make a speech with a policy highly relevant to Milwaukee, have a rally in or near Milwaukee, I think it's appropriate for this subreddit. At some point, however, we need to cut it off. I've removed posts about Scott Walker and Obama in the past because they simply aren't relevant enough for this specific subreddit.

Walker's point would probably be the best investment as it's definitely on the rise an I can see it being absolutely amazing in the next 5-10 years (pretty sweet now as is).  Deals can be had in Bay View, but for the most part it's already highly valued (with good reason). I live in Bay View, and just think it has the best mix of affordability, proximity to the lake, community, and access to downtown. There are a lot of older residents selling their out-dated homes right now, and if you don't mind a little updating, the returns will be massive.  Lower east side is awesome too, if you can afford it and don't mind the busy atmosphere and lack of parking, but it's already pretty expensive, and your dollar won't go as far. But it'll still be a solid bet investment-wise.  Riverwest is still a gamble in my book. The community is unmatched, in a good way. I love so much about it. But the reality is that property values and crime are always moving up and down."

I didn't mind parking on the street, but the one time my car got towed because I accidently blocked a driveway in winter. Not cool at all."
milwaukee,3dwqoo,Nolon,16,Wed Jul 22 03:41:08 2015 UTC,"Bayview is overvalued and the property crime is super high. Walker's Point and the Lower East Side are sure bets at this point. Riverwest is great but it's block by block, but you can get great deal."
milwaukee,3dwqoo,mattkoster,19,Mon Jul 20 06:21:00 2015 UTC,"I am calling BS on the claim that property crime is high. According to the official statistics, Bay View is the number one safest neighborhood in Milwaukee. That does not break apart property and violent crime, but given that violent crimes are less than 25% of crimes, there is no way that your claim is supportable. There is a huge amount of hysterical reporting on a Bay View Neighborhood Watch group on Facebook. Is that where you are getting your stats? I agree about being overvalued -- it is a great place to live, but not a great place to invest."

Crime happens, and you can reduce it by being smarter (like, by locking things), but it will never completely go away. That Facebook page does an incredible disservice to the community by treating every incident as if it were the tip of a crime wave iceberg. The reason why communities feel safe is because people feel safe in them and act accordingly by being out and about. When people get into a bunker mentality and hide at home the neighborhoods around them deteriorate."

They've been hot for years now.  A coworker just lost a 3rd house they bid on in Walker's Point.  They offered full asking price, no contingencies on all 3 and lost them to full price +10%, all cash offers.  People are buying up SFH like crazy in the 'trendy' areas and paying cash to flip and sell or rent them out."
milwaukee,3dwqoo,Yomat,9,Mon Jul 20 12:03:51 2015 UTC,"I spent two years looking for a great investment property deal in Milwaukee, and focused my search on the Eastside, Bay View, Wauwatosa, and Riverwest.  Are you looking for a duplex or multifamily?  I focused my search on multifamily, and learned a lot in the process.  A lot of my observations are anecdotal so I am sure some of you will disagree with my observations, which is perfectly fine, but please don't think I am trying to offend your neighborhood.  Every house I looked at in Bay View was either in horrible shape, or overpriced.  I feel like the quality of homes in that neighborhood is just garbage, the rooms are small, and the architecture and style of many of the more affordable homes leaves something to be desired.  If a house is in good enough shape to be easily financeable, and the rooms are large and the layout makes sense, it will probably be overpriced.  Also, just because a listing says ""Bay View"" it often may be far away from what most Milwaukeeans consider the true or desirable areas of the neighborhood, so check where it is on the map before thinking it is actually in a good spot.  On the Eastside you will find a good mix of homes that are nice, but if you are looking for eventual cash flow or appreciation it might take a while to find the perfect mix of a good price, solid house, and rental possibility.  I looked at too many homes near UW-Milwaukee that are just ruined by decades of transient student living, but every now and then a hidden gem will pop on the market and off in 2-3 days.  I found a fantastic two flat duplex, three bedrooms in each unit, that had been in the same family for 50+ years and had two sisters living in each unit, and it had 4 offers on the first day it hit the market it was in that good of shape.  If you have patience, and keep an eye on the market, you might catch something nice like that.  I think that Riverwest has houses that tend to be in better shape than Bay View or the Eastside, but it has been ""up and coming"" for the 10 years I have lived here.  The room sizes tend to be small, and I have heard that there are significant drug issues in the neighborhood.  A friend of mine owns a bunch of houses in the neighborhood with her husband, and they keep buying the houses that go on the market on their street so they can control who their neighbors are, but before then she said they had some problems.  East Tosa is also a great place to look, but property values are getting inflated there as well.  Parking can be a pain in Wauwatosa since you cannot park on the street overnight, and if you have more than one car you might be SOL.  So where did I end up finding the perfect mix of quality properties, good neighbors, and up-and-coming value opportunity?  A nice little neighborhood called Washington Heights.  This neighborhood is tucked away along the border of Tosa, and prices here, especially this year, just keep going up.  The houses here are gorgeous.  The people are nice and look out for each other, and crime is lower than the Eastside/Bay View/Riverwest neighborhoods.  The people on my block are buying the houses that used to be primarily rentals, and owner-occupying and fixing them up (like me).  We are right near the border of East Tosa, so it is a 10 minute walk to the bars and restaurants that keep popping up on North Ave.  The mayor lives here.  The mansions on Washington Blvd. and in the Washington Highlands seem to help keep things stable price-wise.  There are some cool restaurants and bars on Vliet, including Valentine coffee, which is great.  The main reason I believe this neighborhood is so affordable is because it is within MPS so people with kids don't want to buy here.  If you look at the same exact kind of duplex that I bought, but find one on the market two blocks over in Tosa, it will cost $50-$100k more than mine.  People that live and end up staying in the neighborhood tend to send their kids to the local parochial schools to avoid MPS.  Check it out, I think you will be pleasantly surprised."
milwaukee,3dwqoo,djlawman,3,Mon Jul 20 15:07:21 2015 UTC,"I second Washington Heights. There has been quite a bit of change to this area over the last 3 years, only for the better. More small businesses are popping up and a lot of new, young families are moving into the area. The houses here have been moving fast though it seems."
milwaukee,3dwqoo,bark_bark,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:50:46 2015 UTC,"I lived in a rental in Washington Heights. House was nice, but you couldn't walk up to North Ave if you were a female. Not in daytime and especially at night. Unless you wanted to be continually harassed because apparently manners is nonexistent there. Washington Park has potential, but again there's someone failing at manners and they've trashed some parts of the park. Additionally the white folks are to scared to maintain it so there's that issue. But it's still a beautiful park. That if you read about was once a really great park. Then you've got the great things that coffee shop which I want to check out. Times cinema, and Rose bud. I lived at 51st and North. Anything 60 and higher is nice on North anything lower in streets crossing becomes a ruin. Maybe that has changed, but that's how it was in 2010. Rocket Baby which I want to check out too. I couldn't live there now though. Sure there's those amenities, but if you want the grand scale of walk-able neighborhood then River West/Shorewood/East site imo. I've heard there is or was some crime going on on the east side. They've said here there's druggies in River, but I haven't been here long. I keep to myself. I see a lot of people out and about of all different races and such. Though they're all just going about their day. Who knows they could be drugged up and ready to mug someone, but I haven't been bothered. It is extremely quiet here, but there's the whole city outside my door. Which I can easily walk to MAM, I can bike anywhere north to Schlitz Audubon Nature Center or south to Bay view. But yes the old beautiful homes in Washington Heights is nice. I live in an apartment. Though I'm content. Plus it has been remodeled and there's some gripes but all in all I like it. I like coffee too. Especially exploring coffee shops. Which here where I live they're everywhere. The lake is here, Oriental, Downer, parks, and much more. So get out in your vehicle explore explore Washington Heights, and everywhere.  Oh and it isn't always quiet, but then again the noise for me isn't to bothersome. People cruising fast down the street, the bar next door, but the bar really isn't that bad. There was this one car though the other night and the bass, or whatever was so obnoxiously loud and I do mean loud. It was hurting my ears, but that was once."

milwaukee,3dwqoo,hambonekneeslap,4,Mon Jul 20 13:38:44 2015 UTC,"It's a great neighborhood, but not sure how overlooked it is. Good homes are regularly going for over asking price.   From an investment perspective, prices are certainly going up, but it's hard to say where along the curve they are right now... certainly not at the bottom. Then again, the prices may have a bit more stability than single family homes in Milwaukee proper b/c of homebuyer fears about MPS.   That said, I wouldn't steer anyone away from East Tosa. My husband and I LOVE it. We've been renting here for a year, and moving later this week into the home we purchased here."

milwaukee,3dwqoo,MissAnthropy1982,2,Mon Jul 20 19:18:28 2015 UTC,"Depends on your time horizon.    If you're thinking about the next 3-5 years, for a place to live with youthful nightlife, the suggestions here are ok.    As an investment, though, it's a tough time.  Everyone's afraid that mortgages are about to be expensive, so prices are getting distorted in ""hot"" neighborhoods where you could flip or rent.    If your timeframe is a bit longer, I'd say you should follow the classic strategy of going where the baby boomers are headed, but before they get there.    So where are they going?  Boomers are going to cash in their $450,000 homes in Elm Grove and look to downsize and live off the difference.  So you want lower cost, convenience, low maintenance.  Probably a condo downtown, or a home west of the freeway in West Allis."
milwaukee,3dwqoo,flopsweater,2,Mon Jul 20 13:55:58 2015 UTC,"Bayview would have been a great investment like 15 years ago but I agree with everyone that Walkers Point is the most up and coming that you've stated. The east side is great but it's not necessarily a great investment, riverwest  and Shorewood are great options as well. Riverwest is a lot more sketchy but if you lived in a city before you'd  be fine in that area. I also agree with the people who have said East Wauwatosa if you aren't concerned about being a little ways from downtown."

Unless you score a nice house on the lake prices are dropping these days. With residency lifted a lot of city employees are trying to leave the city and are taking losses on houses. You can find a lot of houses on zillow with cheap prices next to a 200k house that the owner is trying to sell at the price they bought it for.   Honestly if you're  going to buy I'd look at the north shore (Shorewood, fox point, whitefish bay) the east (tosa) or a bit further south near cudahy and the southern suburbs.   Also a lot of houses on the upper east side are pricey but you get a lot of loud college kids and thee petty crime (sometimes violent) that comes with criminals targeting that population.  Just my two cents."

milwaukee,3dw8lh,BarcaJeremy4Gov,3,Mon Jul 20 01:57:08 2015 UTC,"MGC staffer here - what everyone said is pretty much true; eBay is probably going to net you just as good of prices as any brick and mortar these days. Visibility to the hobby is at an all-time high, so the days of finding boxes full of games for cheap is long gone as vendors now have a readily available set of sites to look up prices on.  If you do want to shop local though, one thing I'd reccommend is to look for Church-affiliated thrift stores or consignment shops off the beaten path. Goodwill generally will post anything of value that they receive on their national auction site...if it doesn't wind up there, it sits by the DVD/CD rack for ridiculous prices (last NES game I saw at Goodwill was a copy of SMB/Duck Hunt for 20 bucks, which is about $18 too much).   Down in Chicago, there are a couple of stores that sell retro stuff - People Play Games has been around for a bit and is definitely worth a visit (even if they're a little on the pricier side). The Exchange in Wicker Park actually has a really good selection and is fairly reasonable. A quick Yelp search shows a few new stores around that area but I haven't seen them first-hand yet. I have a buddy in the Chicago area that runs an online store - http://www.windygaming.com - super-honest guy and great customer service.  The Media Exchange shops around town will occasionally have some stuff - they're actually great places to pick up GC/PS2/PS3/XB/XB360 games on the cheap as well if you're not looking for mega rare crap.  If you're looking for particular titles, or just cheap rando's, the area conventions and their vending spaces are a great option. The Midwest Gaming Classic is the biggest one and happens in the March/April time frame. There's a smaller show called the Video Game Summit in the Chicago area; that one just happened a few weeks ago. If you're willing to travel there's Too Many Games in Philly, MagFest in the Baltimore area, Portland Retrogaming in...Portland, and a bunch of others.  Good luck in your search!"
milwaukee,3dw8lh,jeffhlewis,2,Mon Jul 20 16:07:16 2015 UTC,"Sadly, Mass Media Xchange is pretty lousy for NES games (and any retro games) these days. I recently checked the East Side and Greenfield locations, and both had, like, five games each. Gone are the days when they had entire shelves or bins you could rifle through. Now they have five games locked behind giant glass cases like they're rare artifacts or something.  Best bet: Wait until the 2016 Midwest Gaming Classic. It's a ways off (they haven't announced the 2016 dates, but the 2015 edition was in April), but you'll find anything and everything for NES there.  https://www.midwestgamingclassic.com/"

It also puts you right next to downtown and on the edge of Walker's Point which is quickly becoming one of the best restaurant districts in the city.   Want great local ice cream? Head to Purple Door Ice Cream. A nice tiki drink, jump across the street to Lucky Joe's Tiki Room. If you head south you'll find Milwaukee Brewing Company which has one of the finest brewery tours in the city ($10 all you can drink).    tl;dr   Iron Horse Hotel Great Lakes Distillery Harley Davidson Museum Milwaukee Brewing Company Purple Door Ice Cream Lucky Joe's Tiki Room Potawatomi Casino"

milwaukee,3duk2n,captainsims,3,Mon Jul 20 15:42:06 2015 UTC,"You'll be here at the tail end of it, but the Milwaukee Art Museum current exhibit is worth checking out if you're into modern art. It's guest exhibit from New York and it features Warhol, Dali, Rothko, and the like. Also, the Villa Terrace Decorative Arts Museum is worth checking out if you have the extra time.  The MKE brewery tour is my favorite, but we have a few good ones here. A lot of people really enjoy the Lakefront tour. The Miller tour is certainly the most historic.   As for where to stay it depends on how adventurous you are. I'm a big fan of using airbnb over hotels, but I know that isn't for everyone. You get a more ideal location, well more options for sure, and often a much better price. That being said third ward is probably the best centrally located spot for what you want.   For nightlife and bars it really depends on what you are looking for. Bay View has a lot of bars with fantastic beer selection. It can turn some people away because they view it as snobby or even the dreaded ""hipster crowd"" but I don't see it that way. There is still plenty of cargo shorts and bud light to be found.   Public transportation is bad here, but is great for a bigger city. This isn't the kind of city where you can just stand at a corner and find a cab. At least not most of the time. So do yourself a favor and get Uber if you don't already have it.   As far as where to eat goes I am not much help. I go out for food maybe once or twice a month, and that's more casual dinning than something worth mentioning for a trip. I can, however, suggest Meraki. It's a different dinning experience than most places here. I'm sure others will have more suggestions on places to eat.   And lastly, if you are looking for a neat drinking experience that isn't beer Bryant's is a good place to try. It can get busy on the weekends though."

They adopt out all animals they get (other than those that might be too sick/injured to adopt).   Are you a no-kill shelter?  The Wisconsin Humane Society never euthanizes animals for  reasons of space or time. All animals in our adoption program  have as long as it takes to find a new home; there are no time limits in our adoption program. This is true for all our campuses.  We do not use the ""no-kill"" phrase because we have found that  it confuses people. There is no universal definition of “no-kill” that  is understood by animal welfare professionals, and the general  public, despite efforts of some groups to create such language. There are also “no-kill” sanctuaries and organizations that do not  uphold humane standards of care, so “no-kill” is not necessarily an  accurate indicator of humane or quality animal care.

milwaukee,3dsy76,Equinox21_,-2,Sun Jul 19 15:51:51 2015 UTC,That's what they say but it seems odd that some of the kittens and cats I've brought them over the years never make it up on their website.

milwaukee,3dsy76,Equinox21_,-1,Sun Jul 19 22:08:37 2015 UTC,"Hopefully, that's what happened with the three I brought in last week. They never showed up despite being of age, healthy and socialized. Was two pregnant females and one male. All three of the same litter and roughly 8 months old. The females- yeah- foster care till they have their litters and then spay 'em and get them in the system to be adopted. The male? Super friendly and FIP/FIV negative but all black. Black cats are adopted less, it's just a sad fact. We named him Barney and he never showed up on the site.  I've been in contact with Christine at WHS for a long time. Our neighborhood is bad for stray cats and we've been working on curbing the population of un-neutered males and un-spayed females for the last three years. The older cats who aren't good candidates for adoption get sterilized, all shots and an ear clipping and then let back where they were picked up. The kittens we usually bottle feed (if necessary), socialize and then bring to WHS for adopting out. It's been working out well up until recently. Used to be, I'd see the kitten I brought them the following day or two. Over time, (over the last year or so- I don't bring them cats every month or anything) it's been less and less. Now I hardly ever see the surrendered kittens online. They claim to update the website every 30 minutes. It's all volunteer and non-profit and I know they're super busy so it's not reasonable to expect amazing website maintenance and that's understandable. However, since last October, we've brought them 6 kittens (counting the recent three) and only one ever showed up as up for adoption. They won't tell me why, you SURRENDER the animal and they cannot/will not tell you what happens after. I've asked for them to let me know if they were going to have to euthanize, to call me- I'd come get the cat. I'd give them money- but that's simply against their policy. I feel they are one of the best resources for the stray cat population in Milwaukee, and I'll continue to work with them. I was just hoping I'd post here and a person would want to adopt the ones I'm caring for now. Now I know better but it was worth a shot anyway! ¯_(ツ)_/¯"

Even if you don't like the Bucks (or, when the Bucks were bad and not fun to watch), being able to come see visiting NBA stars is quite the luxury. I used to drive down from Green Bay just to see Lebron play.  I'm also not sure about ""Loser - MLS in Milwaukee."" I remember the idea/desire for an NHL team came up during the stadium debates, and the rebuttal was always ""well if we show that we can't even support the longstanding Bucks, why would anybody expect that we can support a brand new expansion team?"" Granted, a soccer team wouldn't be able to also share a basketball arena, but I think part of the argument stands. I also had no idea that an MLS team was even on anybody's radar."

Peking House - imo the best Chinese food in The city. The entire second half of the menu ""house specials"" is all traditional Chinese food. Back at their old location this section was an entire separate menu they only have to Chinese people and it was in Chinese. I'd highly suggest the boiled beef Szechuan style, the lamb with green onions, sliced maw (it's a cold appetizer so be prepared), and chicken with dried chilis. As you may have surmised, this place is Szechuan style. Peonys out in Wauwatosa is great too. They are more dim sum style and I've only been a couple times so I can't suggest anything. Fortune out on hwy 100 is also great. Here id suggest the seafood soup. Huan xi over by uwm is pretty good too. Also Szechuan style but not as good as peking. They are a little cheaper though."

milwaukee,3dkwuf,holeydood3,2,Fri Jul 17 19:04:14 2015 UTC,Just because you're Asian and been to Asia doesn't mean you can discount all of the Chinese restaurants in the US. You haven't been to all of them and you can't say for sure what all of them serve.
milwaukee,3dkwuf,mtlyoshi9,2,Fri Jul 17 23:51:02 2015 UTC,Not to mention what cuisine across all of China is. Chinese cuisine varies quite drastically by region.

milwaukee,3djrg6,CLEfitness,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:43:34 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely look into if there are any language exchange groups setup on meetup.com.  While in college I studied Chinese and usually had 2 language exchange partners where we'd talk in Chinese some, and English so they could practice.   It's possible that Marquette or UWM have language exchange groups, and you probably wouldn't have to be a student.   If you want to learn Chinese you can download  Wechat and use the 'look around' function to see who's around you.  Wechat is an chatting app that most Chinese people use.  Last option is using lang-8.com.  There are people all over the world and you're basically proofing their posts to help improve their language skills.  Proof some posts, put in your languages you want to study, and people will contact you asking if you want to Skype or something to practice.  The site works pretty well to develop a friend/tutor type of deal with mutual exchange.    Edit:  UWM offers continuing education classes, and there are tons of languages to choose from.   Noncredit class, but you're getting the classroom style that most people need when starting out on a language.  It's pretty affordable when you consider the cost versus what you'd pay a tutor to do 1v1."

It is 10 times better than the previous stupid skeleton logo but why though does the Admirals front office ignore all the fans requests for the skating sailor logo to come back? It seems like when ever I go to Ad's games I see tons of the old jerseys or people wearing apparel of the skating sailor logo.  The new logo was supposed to be a compromise for fans of the sailor and the skeleton. How wrong they were. We get more pirate themed logos shoved down our throats to silence our calls for the old logo to come back. Distancing themselves from Milwaukee Admirals tradition sucks, especially in the same breath that Ad's VP John Greenburg says that when the team moves to the MECCA that they want to give the games a ""retro"" feel. What better than the retro logo to go with your ""retro"" feel that you want to give games John? I will always love the Admirals as they are one of the oldest teams in the AHL. Please though bring back the skating sailor as even an alternate jersey like the Brewers do with the ball and glove logo. I think they would be very surprised at the great response they would get from the fans of this great city."

Then think about the businesses surrounding that will benefit from it, not to mention the long term growth. They're opening up the Pabst archives and looking into brewing old brews from Milwaukee's golden age for christ's sake. This is a major brand investing in an area that was abandoned for almost 15 years.   This is the start of revitalization. Haymarket, Brewer's Hill, Halyard Park and MLK will feel this. If we're lucky it'll spread over the bridge and maybe it'll work its way over into Parkview."

I've lived here for almost 13 years now and seen a lot of blackhearted shit get spouted and hey, don't get me wrong, I've been guilty of that too. But during that time I've seen businesses come and go. Some developers try to make a play but then back out. I still remember when they were talking about turning the old Pabst site into a friggin Dave and Busters. Thank god that never took off. I still remember when the off-ramp went down and then how pissed off I got when they finally tore down Sydney HIH.   I think a lot about this city and the shit it's been through. How it's got a lot of people going against it. We're the first born child that is always getting into trouble. So many problems but the main hub  that attracts business and tourism. I keep hearing people classify us as one step away from being the next Detroit.  But man, over the last two years, I have sat down and talked with non-profit groups, neighborhood associations, business improvement districts, and the businesses inside those districts. With all those conversations, the one thing I am absolutely certain of is Milwaukee is on the rise. There is going to be so much up and running by 2016. Just based on what I know I can tell you Walker's Point, Havenwoods, Amani, and Halyard Park will look much different than they do now.   Yes it might not spread over the bridge tomorrow but give it a few years and it will. Thats what gives me hope, people are CARING about this city again. They want to bring business to us in our current state.  EDIT: Typos, grammar"

Just a few days ago, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker signed a state budget that includes cuts of $250 million to the University of Wisconsin system, among other cuts to public education funding.   Unrelated   Together, they will pay just $150 million towards the arena.   I guess we'll just conveniently ignore Herb Kohl's $100M contribution so it sounds like the state is paying for the majority of the arena.   by teams threatening to move—like the Bucks did just a week ago   Or, 'cause it was a condition required by the NBA that a new stadium would be necessary for the team to stay here  Just a shit article all around that makes no attempt to inform, only to persuade."
milwaukee,3dgyid,superdago,4,Thu Jul 16 14:53:40 2015 UTC,"Unrelated   No it's not. The state legislature has decided to cut money from the UW system and a week later decided to give the same amount of money to the Bucks owners for the new arena. Though it's not like they're taking money from the UW system and giving it to the owners, it still shows messed up priorities.   I guess we'll just conveniently ignore Herb Kohl's $100M contribution so it sounds like the state is paying for the majority of the arena.   The point here is that the current owners are paying less than half of the costs.   Or, 'cause it was a condition required by the NBA that a new stadium would be necessary for the team to stay here.   A new stadium is necessary. That doesn't mean that it has to be publicly funded."

My point is that the deadspin article makes no attempt to clarify that point, and seems all too happy to portray this as literally pulling money out of the UW budget and throwing it as the Bucks' arena. Which is why deadspin is garbage."

milwaukee,3dgyid,jimjo9,5,Thu Jul 16 15:06:53 2015 UTC,"The Bradley Center is a different thing.  It was built through the generosity of the late Jane Bradley Pettit in memory of her father, Harry Lynde Bradley, co-founder and chairman of the Allen-Bradley Company (now Rockwell Automation).  No tax payer money.  The Bucks rent the space from the Pettits and so does everyone else that uses that facility.  I think proceeds from the event goes to the people who host it.  Upkeep on the Bradley Center is done mostly with tax payer money.  This was part of the deal that was struck in the 11th hour.  The BMO Harris Bradley Center is unique in that it was a gift from a family without any provision for the building's long-term capital needs or annual operating expenses. While the facility is self-sufficient, the BMO Harris Bradley Center tenants such as the Bucks are at a disadvantage compared with other NBA teams due to the arrangement  On a side note, the Bradley Center almost did not get done, even tho zero tax dollars were spent.  Milwaukee argued about where it would go.  It got to the point that the Pettits said, screw it.  Once the Pettits threatened to pull the offer, then Milwaukee finally got on board with it.  That's how messed up people in Wisconsin are sometimes.  We even argue about a free stadium.  Did this kind of answer your question?"

You need this car to get around for the next 20 years.   As this is your main mode of transportation you have 2 obvious choices. Spend thousands of dollars replacing the frame on the car (that's not worth more than scrap), to only make it last you another few years until something else goes wrong. Or 2, buy a new car. Which is the right answer?  The Bradley Center is horribly outdated, and is in need of very expensive repairs. HVAC, roofing, updated code compliance, major safety issues. As the owner of the Bradley Center, do you spend literally millions of dollars fixing, or spend a little more to build new - to last you 20 more years?"

milwaukee,3ddarf,orangutan9,36,Wed Jul 15 11:05:02 2015 UTC,"Alright kids, everyone sit down and lets have a history lesson on Milwaukee's beer water.   The man you really want to blame for Pabst leaving Milwaukee is a deceased gentleman by the name of Paul Kalmanovitz.   So during the 80s there was a recession happening in Milwaukee, there were 11 major industries and only six survived the recession. Pabst was feeling the pressure from the recession and their profits were on a steady decline since 1978. It especially felt the burn from Miller Lite. Miller Lite was introduced in 1975 and stole all the customers that used to flock to PBR. Miller Lite provided a mass produced light beer that customers loved and Miller having been acquired by Philip Morris didn't feel the pressure of the recession as bad as Pabst.    Now let me tell you about Paul, Paul was kind of an asshole and by kind of I mean he was a really big asshole. He banned telephones in his offices. If he caught one of his employees on the telephone he'd yank the line right out of the wall. He was known for his practice of acquiring businesses, liquidating the assests and selling them off for scrap. Schlitz went under and was purchased by Stroh's in Michigan, Phillip Morris was making power plays with Miller, the time was right for Paul to make his move with his holding company S&P.  S&P bought Pabst via a hostile takeover for 63 million in 1985 then two years later Paul kicked the bucket.   The unfortunate thing about Paul dying was that he had linked Pabst to the Kalmanovitz Charitable Trust. S&P was ordered by the IRS to sell Pabst or lose its tax-free non-profit status. In 1996, Pabst's operations were loaned out to its competitor Stroh's (which happened to acquire Pabst's oldest competitor Schlitz in 1982). Stroh's business plan was haphazard at best, it made more than a few acquisitions and was completely disorganized. An unfortunate result of this was Pabst shutting down operations in Milwaukee and Pabst became a ""virtual brewer"".   Funny story though, in 1999 the group that owned Pabst ended up acquiring Stroh's. Then in 2001 Pabst production went to Miller. Pabst hit an upswing in the mid 2000s and since 2006 leadership has changed hands a few times.   The current owner, Eugene Kashper, is a pretty decent guy I hear from a reliable source. He wants to bring the brand back to Milwaukee. He likes Milwaukee and knows that Pabst was a brand that brought in tourism dollars. Let me tell you people the old Pabst Brewery Tour, it put others to shame. That was a REASON to visit this city.   I'm personally excited to see Pabst return to it's home. Yeah we can get upset about how execs in the 80s fucked everything up and coke parties and strippers and Ronald Reagan and blah blah blah. Those jerks are dead, our baby is coming home and it's going to bring those sweet sweet tourist dollars with it. We are a locals only city and this beer was born here. There is history behind it, Frederick Pabst's house is still intact and awesome even."
milwaukee,3ddarf,brewcitysafari,3,Wed Jul 15 18:11:14 2015 UTC,"In west Milwaukee born and raised. Brewing beer is how I spent most of my days. Chilling out maxim and relaxing all cool, keeping resident happy and drunk shootin darts or playing pool. When a couple of execs they were up to no good, started making trouble in the neighborhood. We got into one lil decline and our boss got scared and said ""you're moving with strohs to operate in a town outside of bell air!l   I hoped for a new brewery but then it became clear. I was bought for my name and a virtual brewery appeared. If anything I can say that this style was rare but I though ""nah forget it, yo home to outside bel air!""  A few years later hipsters made me cool again and the bosses in charge were not a bunch of hooligans. They did the right thing and sent me back east to be brewed again in my home Milwaukee. If anything I can say that this good of a story is rare but I'm back to sit on my throne as the king of Milwaukee beers!"

milwaukee,3ddarf,mgweir,-2,Wed Jul 15 18:23:28 2015 UTC,"I have a bit of a bone to pick with Pabst. As you can see by my user name, the World's Columbian Exposition is a bit of a hobby of mine. Not just a hobby, actually, an obsession, quite frankly. I read and study everything that I can about the fair, and I collect items from the fair.  Anyway, Pabst for over a hundred years has claimed that they got their name by winning the blue ribbon at the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. In fact, it even says it on the can. Pabst made a HUGE promotion about this - he even draped entire bars in a gigantic blue ribbon to promote this ""win"".   Here's the thing, though: It never happened. Pabst never, ever won a ""blue ribbon"" at the World's Columbian Exposition. Blue ribbons were not even given out. Beers that were exhibited at the fair that were of ""high merit"" were given a bronze medal, and that's all. In fact, MANY beers were given a bronze medal for high merit, but there was no blue ribbon.  The ""blue ribbon"" is an absolute lie, and one that has been going on since 1893. But Pabst declared himself the winner and tied little blue ribbons on every bottle of beer, and how was anyone to check, in 1893?  I first got this information by reading about all of the awards given to everything at the fair in ""The Book of the Fair"" - which is THE source for fair information. It clearly states that Pabst earned a bronze medal.   No blue ribbon. It's a complete lie, folks."
milwaukee,3ddarf,1893Chicago,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:03:19 2015 UTC,"Greetings, do you have any articles or a book of some kind saying that Pabst claimed to have won a blue ribbon?"
milwaukee,3ddarf,18kRPM,4,Wed Jul 15 21:32:40 2015 UTC,"I believe their website says this, as does a can of the beer itself."
milwaukee,3ddarf,1893Chicago,2,Wed Jul 15 21:35:05 2015 UTC,"He didn't put a blue ribbon on there to signify that he received a blue ribbon. He put it on there to show that it won awards, specifically first place. If the argument is ""He didn't win a blue ribbon"" you're absolutely right, he didn't. He did win first place though. Most likely this was done to reflect a change in ownership from Best to Pabst. The beer used to be called Best Select but Pabst needed to slap their name on there and get some serious brand name recognition.  It's a brand name, not a specific statement saying ""they give blue ribbons out at the World's Columbian Exposition"". It's marketing, it rolls off the tongue, something that was sorely needed in a competitive beer market like late 1800s Milwaukee.   Blue ribbon history for all: http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/where-did-pabst-win-that-blue-ribbon-138975181/  EDITED: put incorrect information on here"

milwaukee,3ddarf,1893Chicago,2,Wed Jul 15 21:51:51 2015 UTC,"As I already mentioned, I'm not doubting you but we're arguing semantics here. If it were the 1890s no doubt it would cause a scandal and Pabst's business reputation would be at stake....or maybe it wouldn't because people had bigger concerns back then. One could argue the same thing with Schlitz being the ""beer that made Milwaukee famous"" when the reality of it is Schlitz is the beer that made Milwaukee famous to Chicago since they brought beer down to help with the Great Chicago Fire. The argument is pretty moot now since they stopped tying blue ribbons on their bottles after a silk shortage in World War I though.   Again you are correct, they did not win a blue ribbon in the 1893 Columbian Exposition. He did win a prize and marketed the hell out of it drastically increasing his sales over the competitors. Same prize as his competitors but won more than they ever did."

I was curious if anybody had any older literature that had Pabst himself making this claim, I had taken the Pabst tour a while back, and the guy who gave the tour said everything you just said about how they didn't even give out ribbons at the expo, they received a bronze, so a fair credit to him.  He had said that the reason that the ribbons were tied on was to distinguish them from other beers on the shelf and had nothing to do with the expo.  I want to say that the reason he gave why they started advertising it as such had something to do with one of the previous buyers who started labeling the cans as such and they never changed it :/"

milwaukee,3dbv7z,KevinSorboFan,8,Wed Jul 15 16:48:14 2015 UTC,"As a Bucks fan, I'm excited.  As somebody who is very anti-Walker, very much entrenched in the UW system, and would consider myself as liberal as they come, it is hard to reconcile those feelings with this issue. As some sort of cognitive dissonance, I guess I can convince myself that worst-case scenario, we can use this arena deal for leverage (i.e., you spent money on THAT so why can't we spend money on this now??)  Best-case scenario for me is that the Bucks young players really do fulfill their potential and we become a title contender (which hopefully brings with it as positive of an economic impact is possible with the new arena).   On a completely unrelated issue, I think the Bucks could really do some good with regards to community outreach. The NBA as a whole tends to do a good job of this with building playgrounds/reading centers or holding food drives, etc., but if you look at what Joakim Noah of the Bulls has tried to do in Chicago to speak out against gang violence, it is really amazing. With Milwaukee's current trend of violence, having that type of figure preaching that type of message would be great. I'm not gonna pretend that this Bucks arena = end of Milwaukee violent crime, but I think there could be some great non-economic benefits to giving the city something to support.  In retrospect, I wish we could have just gotten the Potawatomi deal when it was offered. I would be interested in seeing any more details of how exactly that shook down"
milwaukee,3dbv7z,tevert,8,Wed Jul 15 02:00:05 2015 UTC,"Your point about the outreach is a damn good idea. It gets the Bucks more good PR, so attendance goes up, the community gets some positive figureheads, and the whole picture looks prettier for tourists and other outsiders."
milwaukee,3dbv7z,xSHLOMOx,10,Wed Jul 15 03:16:53 2015 UTC,State budgetary money for this arena is not being spent at the expense of UW school system.
milwaukee,3dbv7z,KevinSorboFan,4,Wed Jul 15 05:23:49 2015 UTC,"Oh no, I definitely understand that. I only brought up the UW thing because I think if they fought as hard or got as creative with sources of funding for the schools as they did for the stadium, the cuts wouldn't have had to be so big. I can definitely see why non-sports fans would be against supporting a deal like this, but that is far as I go (that is, I see their viewpoint but still disagree; I fully support the Bucks staying!!)  Bucks in 6"

Water street is just more established. I would argue that Brady street is starting to go the way of Water street and becoming more commercial.

Those seasons are known as Construction and More Construction.  OR   Summer: Where it get's muggy and warm, or muggy and WTF kind of hot. Also, it's cold sometimes. Like 50 dgrees over night.   Fall: It's lovely, except when it's not. Fall can end where between October 10th and November 30th. You will get all kinds of weather, from summer to rain to snow, to WTF.   Winter: Sometimes it's mild with a lot of snow, some times it's WTF cold with a little snow. Sometimes its WTF cold with a lot of snow and wind. It's winter. It's Milwaukee. It's cold.  Spring is the reverse of fall.   Seriously, we have 4 seasons. We have some beautiful days. We also have some crazy weather days. Wind chill is how cold it 'feels', a mathematical computation of temp + wind. It can get below zero for several days each winter. Buy a decent jacket, decent boots and warm gloves. You will want a hat you will wear that covers your ears. Hope that helps."

milwaukee,3daz7b,mattkoster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:41:21 2015 UTC,"When he says buy a decent jacket, he means buy a jacket out here. They get put out probably starting in September or so, so you'll have plenty of time.  To get technical about windchill, first I should point out that humans don't feel temperature, we feel heat. That is, we feel how quickly thermal energy moves into or out of our bodies. Here's a good video describing the difference, and how humans go about detecting temperature.  So, when we feel cold, what we're really doing is interpreting how quickly we lose heat. If we lose heat faster, we feel colder than if we lose heat slower, and our bodies respond to those temperatures.  You're probably already familiar with the effects of windchill; on a hot day, when you're sweaty, and a nice breeze comes along to cool you off, that's windchill. It increases the rate of evaporation for the perspiration on your skin, which carries heat away faster, making you feel cooler.  In the winter, however, the already cold temperatures and potentially fierce winds can lead to frostbite conditions. Don't worry about the equation (it's clearly wrong or missing information); worry about the frostbite times.  But, windchill is only a factor for exposed skin. When skin is not exposed to the wind, the wind can't chill it! That's why, beyond a good coat, what you want are layers. Not so many that you cut off circulation (this kills the tissue, and is just frostbite without the freezing), but not so few that the wind can penetrate to the skin. You might want to look into long underwear."

milwaukee,3daz7b,DavidPx,5,Thu Jul 16 15:10:47 2015 UTC,"As I have no clue about where you will be living there are some things you want to consider when looking for a place to live.  Because our winter can be a little rough on cars, cold mornings and salt from the roads, you also want to think about that when looking for a place to live. Winter can be tough if you have to park on the street.  Also, cars can be more difficult to start if they are out all night. Also, I think it can de difficult to shovel out your car is it is on the street.  Likewise, how much shoveling do you want to do in the winter.  I live on a corner with sidewalks, love my house, but I have lots more to shovel than most.   It may not be a huge deal, but something to think about."

milwaukee,3daz7b,Freetoad,5,Thu Jul 16 03:41:47 2015 UTC,"Alright, so you're moving from a climate paradise to one of the least comfortable climates in the world.  First, let's start off with this. The average low for your coldest month (December, at 47.5 degrees F) is equivalent to the low for our 7th coldest month; May (46 degrees F). Your average warmest month (August, 84.4) is only a few degrees warmer than our average warmest month (July, 81).  Our springs and falls are going to feel similar to what you would consider winter. Our summers are going to be very slightly cooler, but very humid and muggy. There's less air pollution here, however. Winter is obviously the season you'll need the most help with.  First, buy a warm coat. Style is up to you, but it needs to be practical. Wool peacoats are very stylish right now for both genders, with black being the major color (although women occasionally get other colors). They're very warm, assuming you are willing to supplement with a hat and gloves (I wear knit for each, but I've also lived up here my whole life, and am much more used to the cold).  In the winter, social life dies down a bit, and people spend the majority of their time inside. It can get cold enough that it is dangerous to be outside for longer than a few minutes, and in extreme cases can freeze car batteries or locks, making it critical to have backup plans. Learning to drive in snow and ice is difficult, and I really recommend you drive excessively safely whenever there's snow on the road.  Just remember that there's a reason drinking culture is so different here than LA. We don't have many clubs, but have a ton of bars, spread out s that there's almost always one in walking distance. If bars aren't your thing, there are game shops, bowling alleys, movie theaters, live theaters, and plenty of other things to do inside. And winter sports can be quite a lot of fun, too, once you adjust to the climate."
milwaukee,3daz7b,firemastrr,2,Wed Jul 15 02:18:21 2015 UTC,Seriously appreciate you taking the time to share all of this. Thank you so much. I'll be planning for the weather with your post in mind.

Other positives:    No flies/mosquitoes,  You don't have to cut the grass every few days Shoveling snow can replace your day's trip to the gym Ladies - you can skip shaving your legs for a few months Having a party and you forgot ice for the beer?

milwaukee,3daz7b,rogue,4,Thu Jul 16 03:42:35 2015 UTC,"Welcome!  Milwaukee is certainly different than LA, but there's a lot to love about it and hopefully you'll enjoy your time here.  Seasons vary a ton year to year.  This summer has been remarkably cool, with temperatures rarely above the mid 70s and cooling off to 60ish at night.  Other years we can get blasted with 80+ degree days in early June.  Usually it's somewhere between the two.  On average:   Summer: Lasts from late May/early June to early September.  Warm to hot, can get humid.  Highs range anywhere from 70-100.  Number of days over 100: 1-2.  On the cooler days, the night can drop into the high 50s.  Usually this is inconsistent too, some days are better for playing volleyball on the beach (cloudy and 70s) and others are better for for swimming there (sunny and 85+). Fall: Lasts from early September to mid/late November.  Beautiful, easily my favorite season.  Mild and dry, with highs between 45-65 and lows occasionally hitting freezing.  Great hoodie, bonfire, and football weather.  It's always comfortable, with early fall feeling like a cool summer and late fall feeling like a warm winter. Winter: Lasts from mid/late November until mid/late March, usually.  The weather that made Milwaukee famous.  Cold and frequently wet.  Highs consistently below freezing December-February.  Highs usually fluctuate between 10 and 30, lows -10 to 25.  However, you do see the occasional cold spell dropping highs to as low as -10, lows into the -20s.  More cloudy days than sunny ones. Spring Lasts from mid/late March to late May/early June.  In my opinion, our worst season.  Cool and wet, the traditional springtime (upper 40s, sunny, plants blooming) doesn't really come until late April at the earliest.  Early spring is crummy, 40s and frequently raining.  Late spring gets much more pleasant.  Highs from 30-60, lows 20-50.  Usually the precipitation is rain, but don't put your shovel away until May.   Notes:   Wind Chill:  Good question and a good thing to prepare for.  Conceptually, wind makes it feel cooler than the temperature indicates.  As such, the reported wind chill is a ""feels-like"" temperature adjusting for the wind speed and temperature.  In the winter, this is important and can have dangerous consequences.  You'll see things like, ""15 degrees with a wind chill of -3.""  This means that it's 15 degrees outside, but with the wind (which in this case is moderately strong at, oh, 15-20 miles an hour) it feels like, and affects your body like, a temperature of -3.  Wind, more so than regular old cold, can damage your skin and potentially give you frostbite if your skin is left exposed.  It's important to cover up exposed skin when the temperature drops that low (anything below 10), and especially important when it's windy outside.  This means gloves, hat, and scarf for your face in addition to a normal coat. Lake Effect: I don't know if you've chosen a place to live yet, but it can help to know how the lake changes the weather here.  Lake Michigan is a huge body of water and takes a long time to change temperature, so it regulates the temperature of the land near it.  Within about a mile and a half of the lake, the weather is noticeably more mild than it is inland.  That means warmer in the winter (to the tune of 5-10 degrees) and cooler in the summer (5-15 degrees).  Near the lake we tend to get less snow, for example, because when a storm comes through it might be 28 degrees inland but up to 34 by the lake.  So you get a foot of snow inland and an inch of rain within a mile to a mile and half of the lake.  The springs are also worse near the lake because it takes longer to warm up.  In April, it might be 45 by the lake, not a great day for a walk.  But drive to one of the inland state parks and it could be sunny and 60, much more pleasant for some time outside. Staying Warm: In a word: layers.  My dad doesn't own a winter coat.  Instead, he wears long underwear, a long sleeve t shirt, a fleece, possibly a sweater (if it's super cold), and a water/wind resistant outer layer (basically, a spring jacket).  This is more versatile and cheaper than buying a bulky, massive down ski jacket.  The cold won't be an issue as long as you're prepared for it.  Hat, scarf, gloves/mittens, boots, and long underwear are a necessity, as is an outer layer to break the wind.  Your nice wool sweater might be warm by the fireplace, but the lightest breeze will cut right through it and chill you to the bone outside.  Also, never underestimate the usefulness of a scarf or neck warmer--they make a huge difference under any jacket when it gets cold.  And the longer you stay outside, the colder you'll get, and the more it's necessary to wear more layers and move around.  Stay active, walk, even just stand up.  Work up some body heat and your layers will shield you from the elements. Buy a set of flannel sheets for sleeping in the winter. You'll thank me in 6 months.   I think I hit all of your questions above.  Sorry for the wall of text, I tried to be as complete as possible.  Again, I hope you don't find the weather too prohibitive.  If you have any other questions, I'd be happy to help!"

I invested in some really good winter clothing and that made all the difference.   Also, not sure if thunder and lightning are as rare in Southern California as it is in Northern California, but expect a LOT of both (plus a lot of rain) here in Spring and Summer. Kind of cool to experience a good thunder and lightning storm here, but you are bringing animals with you, they may freak out."

milwaukee,3daz7b,smcdark,2,Tue Jul 14 23:41:58 2015 UTC,"Winters are fairly all over the place.  However, every winter we seem to get at least one week where it's below zero every day.  It's a new level of cold, really, but it's not the end of the world.  Having a place with heated/underground/attached parking helps a lot.  A car with heated seats also helps a lot.  You WILL need a warm winter coat, gloves and a hat.  You'll be able to tolerate it just fine as long as you don't spend too much time outdoors.  If you end up with a place where you have to shovel snow, you will need some seriously warm clothes or just take a lot of breaks to warm up.  Most winters we don't get more than a week or two of below zero, though.  Probably the hardest thing will be getting used to driving in the snow.  Try to make sure you have a good set of tires on your car, as driving in the snow can be very scary, even for experienced Wisconsin drivers.  Otherwise, it's really a great place to live.  You really can't beat the quality and quantity of bars!"

milwaukee,3d4d3u,lundej16,20,Mon Jul 13 14:12:37 2015 UTC,He also says that stadiums don't revitalize the surrounding areas. Except this blueprint details doing exactly that. By literally rebuilding a large area around the stadium.
milwaukee,3d4d3u,MaxxBeard,22,Mon Jul 13 15:07:46 2015 UTC,"I thought the blueprints and plans call for $500M in additional planned development, nothing that is set in stone. This is a pretty common part of stadium plans that doesn't always work out. Are there concrete details of what is planning to be in the surrounding area?"
milwaukee,3d4d3u,BarcaBadger,25,Mon Jul 13 15:31:37 2015 UTC,"Yup.  Example:  Pabst Farms development.  Oconomowoc was promised a mall of sorts but that fell through due to the recession.  The town invested millions in infrastructure for it and got left hanging.  Any guarantees that this development around the stadium is going to happen?  I don't think there are and this is a whole ""trust me"" situation where we little people get burned the most."
milwaukee,3d4d3u,HeavyLeadBelly,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:23:59 2015 UTC,"With how much money they have been willing to put in to buying the properties already for the development my guess is that they are fairly motivated. You don't over pay that much unless you are really trying to commit to the development. http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/blog/real_estate/2015/07/bucks-owners-were-motivated-buyers-paying-3-3.html  Plus the man who they put in charge of that is their fourth owner, who is a nationally known real estate developer. I still would like to see a concrete plan and timeline for said development. Maybe try and negotiate and nail down a timeline for such development in the arena deal."
milwaukee,3d4d3u,wild_leprechaun,2,Mon Jul 13 20:22:54 2015 UTC,"They've already purchased a bunch of that land, demonstrating that they are serious about the development. Not to mention this was land that nobody has touched in 20 years due to extreme risk with environmental cleanup costs and whatnot. They are very serious about this part.  In fact, I'd argue the owners care more about the real-estate part of the deal than the stadium (other than that they need the stadium to stay in town)"
milwaukee,3d4d3u,Pine_Barrens,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:41:26 2015 UTC,There are plans for a whole shopping and restaurant pavilion adjacent to the arena. It's looked at as part of the deal.
milwaukee,3d4d3u,lundej16,15,Mon Jul 13 15:33:52 2015 UTC,"Yea, I remember seeing that. The issue is that for a lot of stadiums, those plans fall through or take a much longer time to develop. Like Busch Stadium for example. They had plans for a downtown ballpark village. The stadium was completed in 2006, and the first developments for the ballpark village were essentially started in 2014.  http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/what-s-next-for-ballpark-village/article_93853c8f-15da-5861-a66b-e67368d988cc.html  I worry about similar issues happening in Milwaukee."
milwaukee,3d4d3u,BarcaBadger,5,Mon Jul 13 16:17:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for pointing this out. I looked into actual development plans, and it seems that the owners are working on a final draft to submit from what I can tell. The state is also pushing for a development agreement to hold them to it, which is good. Apparently they're offering up ~$400m. I guess we'll wait and see."
milwaukee,3d4d3u,lundej16,5,Mon Jul 13 16:24:12 2015 UTC,"I think he misunderstands that this deal isn't just rhetoric, THERE ARE LITERALLY FUNDS TO REBUILD THE AREA."
milwaukee,3d4d3u,lundej16,5,Mon Jul 13 15:09:28 2015 UTC,"I thought the only funding that was in place was for the arena itself, with everything else 'planned development.' Is there is a link/document showing the latest funding that is committed around the area?"
milwaukee,3d4d3u,BarcaBadger,10,Mon Jul 13 15:34:25 2015 UTC,"Also we have the oldest, shittiest stadium in basketball. It's not like we built one 5 years ago and we are whining about its age."
milwaukee,3d4d3u,MaxxBeard,4,Mon Jul 13 15:15:32 2015 UTC,The reason they want a new arena is to make adjustments that increase their profit revenue. Maybe you missed the footage of the swimming pool? That was taxpayer funded so the owner's could profit?
milwaukee,3d4d3u,snarkypants,6,Mon Jul 13 17:25:47 2015 UTC,"The reason they want a new arena is to make profit. Yes. But the reasons we want a new arena are so we don't lose the team, which isn't even up to the owners, it's up to the league; we don't want to continue paying maintenance on a 30 year old eyesore that never sells out anyway (the new arena would be smaller and more cost efficient to run); plus, if the deal works out the way I hope it will, they'll invest in renovations in the arena's surrounding area. I don't see why a new stadium isn't a win-win, which is why public funding for such a project is fair, imo."

milwaukee,3d4d3u,snarkypants,10,Mon Jul 13 17:22:38 2015 UTC,"He glosses over the nuance because his overarching point makes those nuances irrelevant. Owners are asking for public funds for something that's going to be profitable for them no matter what. They can threaten not to build an arena and let the team leave, but that is exactly the definition of extortion and that's not okay."
milwaukee,3d4d3u,jabberwik,17,Mon Jul 13 15:51:14 2015 UTC,"The stadium deals that Oliver is referencing here are all way worse than the one we have on the table. STL is on the hook for something like 350 million, Hamilton County spent over 600 million on the Bengals stadium, and the new Vikings stadium is costing the public close to 500 million.   47 from the city and another 55 million from the county shouldn't be a huge burden, especially given that it's being paid with TIF and debt collection instead of new taxes. The only major tax extension is the WI Center District tax - 7%(?) on hotels, 3% on rental cars, and 0.5% on restaurants. This hurts a lot fewer people than the Miller Park tax, and those that it does hit are those that are most likely to benefit from the Bucks staying.   You can't really spend time on details like this in a comedy show, but at least try to compare apples to apples when you're talking about public funding for stadiums. At the end of the day, we'd be giving Lasry/Edens/Dinan money they don't need, but we aren't mortaging our future to do it, and the tax revenue generated by the Bucks is a big enough incentive to soften the costs and get this deal done."
milwaukee,3d4d3u,monsterzero16,5,Mon Jul 13 17:22:18 2015 UTC,"It is a bit disingenuous to just say its a stadium for basketball, the bucks only use the stadium like 50 days a year, having a nice stadium means more events will come to Milwaukee, if the bucks leave the Bradley center will probably be shuddered and nothing will come."

milwaukee,3d4d3u,kapuchinski,20,Mon Jul 13 22:24:57 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty disappointing segment. It lacks any mention of the particular situation in Milwaukee, which has not happened before - namely, that the city county and state all stand to lose substantial sums of money should the team leave. This was not the case in Seattle, nor is it the case now in San Diego with the Chargers or St Louis with the Rams. Nor was is the case with the Vikings in Minnesota or even the Brewers when they were looking for a new arena.  Even if you hate the Bucks and are opposed to public financing for sports arenas - if you care about funding for education, healthcare and roads, you really need to support this deal."
milwaukee,3d4d3u,JaseFace,6,Mon Jul 13 14:23:10 2015 UTC,Is there a guarantee in the contract that a new stadium will do all the things you have just mentioned?
milwaukee,3d4d3u,HeavyLeadBelly,0,Mon Jul 13 14:40:24 2015 UTC,"Guarantee what? I'm talking about the budgetary impact. The guarantee is that if the Bucks stay, those funds stay. If they leave, the funds leave and our budget is even more deprived."
milwaukee,3d4d3u,JaseFace,11,Mon Jul 13 15:11:24 2015 UTC,"I think a big part of his point is that the owners are going to make a massive profit whether they get public money or not. Relocating a team is a very expensive and risky proposition too, so we're a lot safer calling their bluff than the Bucks' lobbyists would have you believe."
milwaukee,3d4d3u,jabberwik,24,Mon Jul 13 14:34:29 2015 UTC,"Mmm, but it's not a bluff. The NBA has said they will buy back the team, and will move it. They're not negotiating. They're saying what will happen per the contract."
milwaukee,3d4d3u,Mokusman1,6,Mon Jul 13 14:35:36 2015 UTC,"Right. This ""threat"" was in place LONG before the new owners were ever in the picture."
milwaukee,3d4d3u,lundej16,3,Mon Jul 13 14:38:07 2015 UTC,"The current owners will miss out on a pretty profitable business if there's no arena, and they can definitely afford to build it without our help. Why would they give up on such a valuable investment like that?"
milwaukee,3d4d3u,jabberwik,0,Mon Jul 13 14:40:34 2015 UTC,"No, like the other dude said, the NBA itself will force the current owners to sell it back to the League. The owners won't get a profit. In fact they'll be stuck with all this property they've bought up around the area which will now just sit unused for another quarter century..."
milwaukee,3d4d3u,JaseFace,3,Mon Jul 13 14:43:32 2015 UTC,"Which is why the owners, who can afford to pay for the stadium themselves, should do so. He's literally said that in three posts..."
milwaukee,3d4d3u,-WISCONSIN-,0,Mon Jul 13 22:36:57 2015 UTC,"They've also been buying up buttloads of land for WAY more than it's worth. A drop in the bucket for these guys, but the more invested they get the less likely it is they'll walk away.  However, it's entirely possible they'd just pay a relocation fee and move the team while keeping ownership if this doesn't work. So they wouldn't be losing as much as some people think."
milwaukee,3d4d3u,lundej16,-1,Mon Jul 13 14:41:35 2015 UTC,Are you talking about that concrete parking lot that's been unused for years?  If the deal goes through the bucks owners are getting that 8 million dollar piece of land for free...

milwaukee,3d4d3u,Breck56,0,Tue Jul 14 02:07:46 2015 UTC,The owners could have chosen to walk away from the contract...or negotiated a better deal.
milwaukee,3d4d3u,HeavyLeadBelly,7,Mon Jul 13 15:34:47 2015 UTC,"No...those were the terms, period. There was never any negotiation. It doesn't matter who owns the team, those are the NBA's rules."
milwaukee,3d4d3u,Mokusman1,6,Mon Jul 13 16:33:57 2015 UTC,"This has nothing to do with supporting  education   It is a similar only in the sense that Grebe is involved, and he also takes taxpayer money for charter schools, which are private and profit tax free. ""Charter School Growth Fund""  In fact some of these Bucks owners also own charter schools and one of them just announced he is building one.    It's a scam to take public money and profit."
milwaukee,3d4d3u,snarkypants,3,Mon Jul 13 17:29:57 2015 UTC,In the segment I believe he references studies showing no increased economic benefits for a stadium.  It was the bit about dropping money from the sky.
milwaukee,3d4d3u,ianingf,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:03:08 2015 UTC,"Right but that's not really what's at stake here. It's the fact that we lose budgetary money if the Bucks leave, due to the manner in which the Bradley Center was built and is maintained, and the manner in which the state utilizes jock taxes...which to my knowledge has not been the case with any previous arena deal.   Also I don't know of other deals that came with 400-500 million in pledged ancillary development."

milwaukee,3d4d3u,jnez50,20,Mon Jul 13 14:12:42 2015 UTC,Why can't they pay for all of it?
milwaukee,3d4d3u,jabberwik,-2,Mon Jul 13 14:35:09 2015 UTC,"Public money for private developments is very common. And in many of those deals, the entrepreneurs don't have to put up nearly 50%."
milwaukee,3d4d3u,MaxxBeard,36,Mon Jul 13 15:06:10 2015 UTC,"I don't care if it's common, I want to know why it's necessary."
milwaukee,3d4d3u,jabberwik,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:16:31 2015 UTC,"The state actually has an incentive to help out, and the owners know this. The government also gets a big cut if hte team stays, so they are looking at it the same way the government looks at them. If they both are going to receive benefits from it, then both chip in. In the end, both are going to make a lot of money. The state loses the income tax revenue stream ($6.5m per year, about to double with a new rising NBA cap) if the team leaves, which will happen per the NBA agreement. The state actually makes a profit off their proposed portion of the loan with the rising cap which is takes effect in 2 years. If the team stays, they have a completely new tax revenue stream from the surrounding development as well, which is a requirement of the deal, not just ""something that will magically happen"". So it's in their interest to capture all of this. And best yet, they aren't on the hook for any maintenance/debt costs.   And looking at the current arena district, there isn't a large substitution effect going on here. Most people I know don't really travel anywhere after basketball games (they don't then go to the 3rd Ward, or walk over to Water St especially in the winter). Park East hasn't been touched in 20 years due to tons of unknown costs (most of them environmental, I believe). If you could go to the bars, then take a heated walkway into the arena before a concert/game, that'd be incredible  I fully support the academic literature about public financing of arenas. It's pretty much fact. But this stadium deal is nothing like those. It's 50/50, the studies don't examine revenue effects from teams leaving since they assume the team stays and just plays in the old arena, they don't analyze areas like Park East, and they don't analyze deals where the real estate development is a requirement of the deal, not just something that is supposed to happen.   If you look at Columbus, OH, they created one of the best downtown districts in the country with a plan very much like this one proposed, except this one is better. The reason why Nationwide in Columbus was a ""bad"" deal was because it was paid for with casino revenues, so when casinos started having some bad years, the public was on the hook for maintenance/debt. However, the Bucks deal is paid for by existing rental car/hotel taxes (like many convention centers around the country), and tax revenue from NBA players, and the team is on the hook for ALL maintenance/service costs. Right now, the public IS on the hook for Bradley Center costs. So you could even argue that this is taking the public out of the game. For the record, since the arena district in Columbus, employment up 190%, sales up 360%, property values up 270% compared to the rest of the city, office space up 70%, and office occupancy up from 80-95%. That's some realized gains right there.  You can be against government giving money to any business on philosophical grounds, won't argue with that. But this deal is not like the ones Oliver speaks of. I feel like general sentiment towards this deal is different if you phrase it from the real-estate perspective. I know more people who had no problem with the government getting involved with Amazon, Ashley Furniture, etc. to stay in Wisconsin. And Daniel, are we playing trivia tonight?"
milwaukee,3d4d3u,Pine_Barrens,3,Tue Jul 14 14:52:38 2015 UTC,"All of this is predicated on the assumption that if there is no state money, there is no arena. I remain unconvinced of that assumption. Their plan does kick ass. It's going to make that neighborhood incredible. It's absolutely an economic slam dunk (no pun intended). There's no reason they need taxpayer assistance to make it happen. As much as people love pointing to scary ol' Seattle (or anywhere else), there is no deal on the table there. There is no ready alternative that's going to lose them less than $250 million and have the upside of owning an entire neighborhood. They can, and should, build that complex with private financing.  Also, I've got tech rehearsal, so no trivia tonight."
milwaukee,3d4d3u,jabberwik,0,Tue Jul 14 16:00:43 2015 UTC,"But the state will benefit from it, so why is it wrong for them to say ""Hey, if you benefit from this too, you should pitch in as well?"". It's simple negotiating. The owners have pledged $250 million for the arena, and then an additional $500 million on top of that for the development that the city desperately wants. They've put far more money into the whole plan than the public. Close to 75% now if you count the stadium + real-estate as an entire package. That's a pretty fair proposal considering the state will start making a profit off that business, and if it's not there, they lose significant income stream and the potential development, not to mention taking the public out of paying for the Bradley Center if the new arena wasn't to be done  And the alternative is already there. Vegas has a stadium already in construction. The NBA has representatives there. Ballmer was ready to pay close to a billion for the Bucks and move them to Seattle, but Kohl's stipulation was that the team could not move and that's why he sold it to L+E. Seattle and Vegas are absolutely in waiting, and the deals have already been put on the table  AND BAH!"
milwaukee,3d4d3u,Pine_Barrens,2,Tue Jul 14 16:06:58 2015 UTC,"The public is definitely going to contribute a TON to this. In fact, I guarantee that 100% of their revenue on the complex is going to come from the public. There's no need for us to fund the startup costs too.  Psh, Vegas has a stadium and no market. I know teams make a stupid amount from TV rights nowadays, but I still think you need people to come to games once in a while. And there's a lot more money to be made in redeveloping Park East than moving to Seattle which already has a vibrant downtown, where a basketball team would just be another thing. Milwaukee has by far the best upside, publicly funded or not, and that's probably why they bought the team in the first place."
milwaukee,3d4d3u,jabberwik,0,Tue Jul 14 16:33:59 2015 UTC,"Because tax revenue. If we don't another city will and we lose the large amount of tax revenue from the salaries (again, NBAs TV contact..)"

As a basketball fan, the few dollars of individual tax increases are worth it to me to ensure the team stays.   Who is going to be the first to stand up? Those bucks owners could build the entire stadium with their own money"
milwaukee,3d4d3u,MrTomAce,3,Mon Jul 13 15:32:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I'm not a basketball fan, but this year the Bucks made the playoffs and yet had the 4th worst home attendance in the NBA. In 2013 they were last in the league in both wins and attendance. Maybe they'd be better off leaving Wisconsin... They'd find a more supportive fan base and the WI taxpayers wouldn't have to pay up to $250m for their stadium."
milwaukee,3d4d3u,dolewhipfan,-1,Tue Jul 14 04:56:28 2015 UTC,Stopped watching after the first 10 seconds when he said the Bucks are threatening to leave. They aren't. The league is threatening to take the team from the current owners and move them.
milwaukee,3d4d3u,whotookmysammich,10,Mon Jul 13 15:10:18 2015 UTC,"Potato, potato. It's the owners' decision either way. They can decide to privately finance it today and it's done. Or they can decide to give up and let the team be relocated. The current owners may not have created the terms of this situation, but they're still in full control of it."

milwaukee,3d9451,snarkypants,-8,Tue Jul 14 21:11:45 2015 UTC,"If you aren't aware, the whole point of the NBAs requirement for an ""updated"" stadium is to increase their profits.  The Bradley center ""needs"" repairs, but when they asked Walker for millions of dollars, they didnt make repairs, they took the tax payer money, and adjusted the skyboxes, so that they could sell more smaller skybox space, instead of less gigantic skybox space that wasn't selling.    The result was higher profit through increased skybox sales which was accomplished through theft of tax payer money. Members of the bradley center board have ownership in the bucks, and therefore seek to increase their profit instead of having the actual center's best interest at heart.  The new arena has less seating. The bucks can't fill the stadium as it is. The whole point of the new arena, is to steal tax payer dollars to create a new environment that keeps patrons within the arena space, therefore increasing their profits, and also restructures the type of seating so that they are able to make as much profit as possible.  There is nothing wrong with the current arena, it's all just manufactured drama in an effort to garner support for tax payer money theft for their private profit."
milwaukee,3d9451,wild_leprechaun,2,Tue Jul 14 16:45:32 2015 UTC,Nothing wrong with an arena with a coolant system that runs on Freon or has a leaky roof. Or outdated electrical.  Granted they should have spent that money on those repairs. I totally agree with you there. I just disagree that there is nothing wrong with our current arena and its state of repairs.
milwaukee,3d9451,snarkypants,-1,Tue Jul 14 18:09:24 2015 UTC,"If the Bradley Center desperately needed the repairs they said it needed, they would have spent the money making those repairs.  It is more profitable for the Bucks to instead use band-measures to defer the maintenance year after year while putting the tax payer money into items that increased their profits. This is what they have been doing all along, and this is what they will continue to do, because there is no motivation to do otherwise.  They already have an established history of being purely profit driven.  If the roof literally caved in tomorrow, or the coolant system completely stopped running, would would the board have to say for themselves.? I believe the Bradley Center trustees should be found personally responsible for stealing tax payer money and misappropriating the funds to areas that allowed them to personally profit as opposed to putting the Centers best interest first and making the necessary repairs. That is what trustess of a building are for, the building is their responsibility.  They have already approached Walker twice within the last several years and gotten at least over 20 million dollars for the Bradley Center.  It didn't go into the roof repair or leaking freon, they remodelled the skyboxes.  They don't deserve an arena built with taxpayer funds. It isn't what tax money is supposed to go towards. It is supposed to go towards things like roads."

milwaukee,3d51h4,workthrowaway68,5,Mon Jul 13 19:43:35 2015 UTC,"that they could afford to build themselves   I'm going to assume it's not quite that easy. The primary owners have net worths of 1.6B each, so around $3B. But they already spend $550M to buy the team, plus have committed another $150 for the stadium. So that's around $700M out of their total net worth of $3B, or about 25% of their net worth. And I'm gonna guess that they don't just have all their money in cash sitting in their checking account.  I get that these guys are billionaires, but then these deals are in the hundreds of millions. I highly doubt they're just being stingy. It is very likely that they actually can't afford to just pay for the stadium outright."

Jamie Dinan is worth atleast $2 billion. Jon Hammes and Ted Kelner are also some of the wealthiest people in the state.   Plus, the expenditure of buying the team is an investment, not a sunk cost. I think the team's value has already climbed 20% in the two years they've owned them which is astounding.   In my opinion, bottom line they can easily afford to finance a facility themselves except for the fact that the economic model in almost all the major professional leagues relies on publicly financed stadiums."
milwaukee,3d51h4,crewblue,0,Mon Jul 13 20:48:42 2015 UTC,They don't have to pay for it out-of-pocket; their net worth is more about their ability to leverage debt than their ability to pay cash for anything.

milwaukee,3d0ng8,Joben86,5,Sun Jul 12 16:54:43 2015 UTC,I have over 10 years of my life up there. I understand the need to close things. I understand life changes.   What I hate is that this is a very poor financial choice for the counsel. They are closing a camp that actually makes a profit and provides and excellent service to young scouts. All this while keeping a camp that losses approximately $300k a year.

milwaukee,3d0r0w,stniesen,8,Tue Jul 14 12:43:41 2015 UTC,"This is a bummer. Melthouse Bistro was great. I think one of the reasons they never really got more business was because they referred to themselves as a grilled cheese shop. When a lot of people think of grilled cheese they just think of white bread and a couple pieces of American cheese, when in reality Melthouse had some AMAZING sandwiches.  If they reopened somewhere with a new name and just called themselves a sandwich shop I bet they'd get a lot more business.  Also, to the people who thought they were too expensive, that's what happens when you actually use really great, high quality Wisconsin cheeses on your sandwiches, it costs a little more."

We are still on the hook for it if we vote no. We just will have a building we need to pay millions of dollars to repair for what the Admirals."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,wild_leprechaun,3,Sat Jul 11 20:19:03 2015 UTC,"""If we vote no we will have to borrow money anyways to at least perform the deferred maintenance or demolition.""  This is not true. The state has no responsibility or obligation to that. A non partisan group of attorneys reviewed all documentation, and there is no obligation."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,littleclick,3,Sun Jul 12 15:59:52 2015 UTC,The wording they used was unlikely. Even at the end of the memo they admit there is a chance that the tax payers will end up assuming the debt depending upon a court ruling. There are not any absolutes on either side of the argument.  Unlikely is not good enough for me in a legal sense when we are talking about this amount of debt. Someone will have to pay the debt. A court battle could be long and expensive for the state depending how the debt is allocated and to who.
milwaukee,3cx0xz,wild_leprechaun,8,Sun Jul 12 19:11:07 2015 UTC,"I wonder how many people against the stadium because of the tax willingly forked over $250 for a piece of paper saying they owned the packers. The packers could tear down their stadium every 10 years and build a new one and no one would blink an eye.  but a new stadium with lots of new amenities and a direct benefit for the city itself immediately and in the long run and Everyone loses their mind.   If the bucs and Brewers left town tomorrow what would Milwaukee be left with? Some summer festivals? A casino? Why would anyone ever come here? We lose the bucs and the Brewers and watch Chicago boom because if you want entertainment you have to head south.   Major sports teams boost the economy and bring jobs. Not to mention entertainment and a rallying point for a city already divided. Losing a major sports team would greatly hurt this city.   But you know, that extra $10-$20 bucks or whatever it is isn't worth it."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,Beastsider,7,Sun Jul 12 00:35:46 2015 UTC,"I wonder how many people against the stadium because of the tax willingly forked over $250 for a piece of paper saying they owned the packers.   Totally irrelevant, and there is a difference between willingly spending money on a team and being forced to.   If the bucs and Brewers left town tomorrow what would Milwaukee be left with?   Why are you talking about the Brewers leaving, that isn't what this is about.   a rallying point for a city already divided   Since the Bucks are still here, shouldn't the city be rallying around them already? Why hasn't that been happening?   Major sports teams boost the economy and bring jobs.   Citation needed.  And the only really good jobs likely to come out of this are roster spots on the Bucks, we don't really need anymore low-wage service jobs in the city.   Losing a major sports team would greatly hurt this city.   So would having taxpayers fund a stadium for billionaire owners.  So many other things that money could go towards."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,purine,4,Sun Jul 12 01:27:28 2015 UTC,"Instead of arguing point by point let me just ask this. Why are you so against the new arena? Honestly? Do you just not like basketball? Think it's a waste of money because it's a class issue? ("" why should I have to pay for these 1%'s toys!), generally don't see how a new stadium and keeping a major sports franchise in the city is a good thing?  I bring in the Brewers because I've heard people were mad about their new stadium too. Also someone's mentioned that eventually they will need an upgrade and what happens then? If we drive the bucs out why would the Brewers stay? Then what is Milwaukee left with? A bunch of hole in the wall bars and a casino?  Look man, or woman, in not from here originally and it boggles my mind why so many people are against things that could make the city better. An NBA team, a street car, etc are all great things for the city so why fight it? Would you rather nothing gets updated ever? Rather we have no major league teams?  No cool downtown amenities?  What if the bucs left. The Brewers left. The casino shut down and summer fest cancelled for good. What would even be the point of this town? A palace for the construction workers to live as they wait to rip up 94 every year and redo it?  Is that what you want? Because when people bash the improvements the city is trying to make it sounds like they'd rather just live in a shithole and be mad about it with a bigger chip on their shoulder than they already have now.   Edit: I also disagree with your point about not needing low wage jobs. Jobs are jobs and whether you think it's good or not people depend on those jobs. A job that pays minimum wage is better than no job at all."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,Beastsider,2,Sun Jul 12 02:03:29 2015 UTC,"I know, right. I was talking about this while I watched the Brewers in the World Series last ye...  Oh, wait."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,SGTBrutus,3,Sun Jul 12 12:05:41 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly indifferent about basketball, if the Bucks leave it'll be a shame but how much money do we, private taxpayers, need to throw at them to keep them here?  To be totally clear the Bucks were bought by billionaire hedge fund managers, Wesley Edens, Marc Lasry, and James Dinan combined net worth in excess of $5 billion dollars according to those Forbes links.  Former owner Herb Kohl is kicking in $100 million for construction and those 3 billionaires are giving $150 million together, about 3% of their combined net worth.  So my main issue is why the hell are they relying on taxpayers to pay for half of the stadium when they could fund it themselves? Do they really want the Bucks to stay here?  What if Milwaukee just can't support an NBA team anymore, I mean it is a pretty small city and larger, richer venues would be more than happy to have an NBA franchise, so why throw money away trying to fight market forces?  And yeah, we could have a bunch of ""cool downtown amenities"" but who is going to pay for them and where will that money come from?  Milwaukee is facing a plethora of very serious issues, none of which will be solved by a new NBA stadium.  Will the new stadium help de-segregate the city?  Will it help the large population of unemployed black males? Will it decrease the gun violence the city is experiencing?  All your questions about the Brewers leaving, the casino shutting down and Summerfest being cancelled are totally irrelevant.  The Brewers will need a new stadium at some point, but Miller Park is only about 15 years old, County Stadium was in operation for like 50 years.  And honestly, Milwaukee has pretty much always been an industrial, manufacturing city so your point about construction workers isn't too far off already.  So my question to you is why are you so eager to throw money at this? Besides it being ""cool"" that Milwaukee has an NBA team, why is that $250 million better spent on a new stadium than practically anything else? And are you aware of how the current proposal is structured, with taxpayers on the hook for loans that will be accruing interest for 13 years before we can even start to pay them off?  Would you take that kind of loan?"
milwaukee,3cx0xz,purine,3,Sun Jul 12 02:37:34 2015 UTC,"So my main issue is why the hell are they relying on taxpayers to pay for half of the stadium when they could fund it themselves?    welfare isn't welfare if you get $250,000,000 instead of $250"
milwaukee,3cx0xz,t3achp0kemon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:27:21 2015 UTC,"To me it's become clear you don't see the value in a new stadium, you admitted you're indifferent to basketball, and you'd rather taxpayer money go towards social issues.   But then you say this.  ""we don't really need anymore low-wage service jobs in the city.""  and then you ask this.  ""Will it help the large population of unemployed black males?""  so which is it? we don't need jobs or we do need jobs?  Whether you like basketball or not or whether you think its lame that people like me think an arena would be ""cool"" the bottom line is this city needs the Bucks. You can call my arguments irrelevant all you want but if the Bucks leave it will only hurt this city."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,Beastsider,0,Sun Jul 12 20:56:49 2015 UTC,"But you know, that extra $10-$20 bucks or whatever it is isn't worth it.    they already have an arena and it isn't doing shit for us.  it just sits empty all the time.  not really sure why a different arena is suddenly going to be more active.  people don't want to do shit here."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,t3achp0kemon,4,Sun Jul 12 13:26:15 2015 UTC,Because the Bradley Center is outdated and can not host any events really. When a new arena is built musicians that normally skip Milwaukee to go to Chicago will probably play at the new arena. I went to the Bradley center at least 15 times last year despite the fact it is in desperate need of being replaced. And all the games I went to were packed   I don't know where you people pull this shit out of your ass about it being empty but it's a fucking lie. People go despite knowing the Bradley Center is stuck in the past while we need to move forward with a new arena and  a new plan for downtown.
milwaukee,3cx0xz,KillerKlown420,-4,Sun Jul 12 21:28:54 2015 UTC,"about it being empty but it's a fucking lie   then we don't fucking need a new one, do we."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,t3achp0kemon,5,Sun Jul 12 23:24:26 2015 UTC,"Do your research. The Bradley Center is outdated and doesn't fit the nba requirements. It is too small, not enough seating,  and the locker rooms are too small. This is why we need a new arena. After that last statement I'm convinced you know nothing of the situation."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,KillerKlown420,2,Sun Jul 12 23:54:06 2015 UTC,It is not too small. It was created for hockey. It is configured wrong. The lower bowl will be bigger and the top part smaller. Just take a minute and look at other arenas online. You will quickly notice what is wrong with the Bradley Center.
milwaukee,3cx0xz,0116316,3,Mon Jul 13 20:40:43 2015 UTC,We literally do. The owners will be forced to sell the team back to the NBA with the intention to relocate is we don't get a new stadium because it is so outdated.
milwaukee,3cx0xz,boatagainsthecurrent,-1,Mon Jul 13 16:39:15 2015 UTC,we literally don't.  we don't need the bucks.
milwaukee,3cx0xz,t3achp0kemon,7,Mon Jul 13 23:27:37 2015 UTC,One of the major reasons I picked Milwaukee over other job offers when I moved here in April was the fact that there were two pro sport teams here.
milwaukee,3cx0xz,TwistedHaze,-1,Sun Jul 12 00:46:28 2015 UTC,Seriously?
milwaukee,3cx0xz,rchiariello,6,Sun Jul 12 20:29:05 2015 UTC,"Uhh, yes. What is so surprising about that?"
milwaukee,3cx0xz,TwistedHaze,-4,Sun Jul 12 21:12:58 2015 UTC,I had never heard of someone making such a huge decision over something so arbitrary. That's all.
milwaukee,3cx0xz,rchiariello,6,Mon Jul 13 13:17:06 2015 UTC,"People like professional sports. I'm not sure how that's surprising that someone might pick here over living in a place like Omaha because they like sports. Fuck, I mean, I moved closer to downtown to be closer to the Bucks. People have different interests, what's the difference between that and moving to Milwaukee for the beer culture? Shit man we need every reason we can take for people to visit our fucking city, damn. Not sure why this even needed to be explained."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,KillerKlown420,3,Mon Jul 13 15:43:58 2015 UTC,Exactly!
milwaukee,3cx0xz,TwistedHaze,2,Tue Jul 14 00:42:09 2015 UTC,"When salary, benefits, and such are close, you have to look at quality of life issues."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,TwistedHaze,-1,Tue Jul 14 00:38:18 2015 UTC,"I live in Milwaukee and like many Milwaukeeans, I am frequently downtown, so this is all on me. I don't like being forced to give extravagant gifts to the richest people in the city, especially for a poorly-attended, poorly-performing sports franchise. Ridiculous."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,kapuchinski,10,Sat Jul 11 19:00:23 2015 UTC,"So you would rather have a vacant building that we the tax payers would be responsible for maintaining.  Don't forget these guys have at least spent 700 million dollars already on this team from the purchase of the team, pumping millions into team development and salaries, re designing logos and merchandise, buying the rest of Herb Kohls outstanding debt left with the team, and buying the surrounding lots for development around the stadium and the money they are throwing in to help build.  The bucks actually this year became one of the only teams to go from having the worst record last year to making the playoffs this year.  Problem is that we the taxpayers are already on the hook for the Bradley Center. Why do we just want to add another vacant building is beyond me when the area north is vacant lots and vacant buildings. We won't see any extra money put back in the UW system or the School cuts if we vote against the stadium.  I know people are against the plan and have place many arguments on how stadiums don't help local development and local economics but no one here has talked about what we are going to do with an empty building. I think its foolish to have us pay millions to maintain a building that is underused and vacant, its a waste. Demolishing it will end up costing millions more. The Astrodome right now is being quoted as possibly costing upwards of 78 million. Granted they have asbestos and foundation issues but the Bradley Center has Freon and roof problems.  Really we should have taken the Menominee's offer but you can all thank Scott Walker for that one."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,wild_leprechaun,2,Sat Jul 11 19:36:37 2015 UTC,"Don't forget these guys have at least spent 700 million dollars already on this team from the purchase of the team, pumping millions into team development and salaries, re designing logos and merchandise   wow they're really giving back to me, the milwaukee taxpayer!"
milwaukee,3cx0xz,t3achp0kemon,-5,Sun Jul 12 13:33:05 2015 UTC,"So you would rather have a vacant building that we the tax payers would be responsible for maintaining.   Vacant building? Horror of horrors!   Don't forget these guys have at least spent 700 million dollars already   On a basketball team. Why does that entitle them 250 million in public funds?   pumping millions into team development and salaries   The organization finally springs for a few market-level players and a coach after ten years of skinflinting it and I'm supposed to get in a tizzy?    re designing logos and merchandise, buying the rest of Herb Kohls outstanding debt left with the team   Logos? Herb Kohl is a rich guy but owed money? None of mine or the taxpayers' concern.   and buying the surrounding lots for development around the stadium and the money they are throwing in to help build.   They should ""throw in"" and ""help"" build a stadium for themselves, of course. They should do all of that and taxpayers should do none of that. Like any other business.   The bucks actually this year became one of the only teams to go from having the worst record last year to making the playoffs this year.   Their attendance didn't improve much, and it was always pretty bad even when they were good. This is a loser of a team and a really huge expensive stadium.   Problem is that we the taxpayers are already on the hook for the Bradley Center. Why do we just want to add another vacant building is beyond me when the area north is vacant lots and vacant buildings.   These lots were purchased by rich, politically-connected people who have been sitting on them and trying to the the city to build a huge project. It's the Esplanade from the Sopranos. It is the soccer stadium in Brazil. It's the Calatrava. It's graft.   Problem is that we the taxpayers are already on the hook for the Bradley Center.   Yes, that's a problem. Let's not compound our problems by doubling down.   We won't see any extra money put back in the UW system or the School cuts if we vote against the stadium.   If the city of Milwaukee doesn't put $250 million into a fabulously excessive sports stadium we will lose out on education money? This is your stretchiest stretch.  Why are you so terrified of a vacant building? They don't all have ghosts."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,kapuchinski,8,Sat Jul 11 20:30:31 2015 UTC,"Why should we pay millions for a vacant building that is the question I'm asking.  I was mainly pointing out that these guys have already spent to close to a billion of their own dollars and most likely will spend a billion. Yes they are worth around 4 billion together but putting one quarter of your entire net worth into one project is a bold move. It was more to frame into perspective why they aren't offering to put in more, they might be reaching close to their financial breaking point who knows I can only guess at their finances.  Yes Herb had outstanding debt with the team, not personal debt. He even tapped an NBA loan program several times and admitted going into debt.  The new stadium we would no longer be responsible for maintenance that would fall to the bucks.   We won't see any extra money put back in the UW system or the School cuts if we vote against the stadium. If the city of Milwaukee doesn't put $250 million into a fabulously excessive sports stadium we will lose out on education money? This is your stretchiest stretch.   I should have been a bit clearer in the statement leading up to that. I was more addressing the argument people are presenting as why spend the money on the stadium when we have these budget shortfalls. Other threads have mentioned using the money to restore the cuts that have been made. That is why I made the comment saying that we won't see any money restored to these cuts if we vote AGAINST the stadium. I should have worded as such and I apologize.  I just think its not a good idea either to pay millions each year to maintain a vacant building. I'm not terrified of vacant buildings I just don't like spending tax payer money on an empty building."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,wild_leprechaun,-2,Sat Jul 11 20:56:38 2015 UTC,Why should we pay millions for a vacant building that is the question I'm asking.   Why would any building stay vacant? Did Mecca stay vacant? They just put a new floor on the court. What about the hockey teams that play there? Why are taxpayers on the hook for it in the first place?   I was mainly pointing out that these guys have already spent to close to a billion of their own dollars   Their own dollars? On something they own and run? It's not charity and they get their 600 million back from the NBA if the deal doesn't go through.   millions each year to maintain a vacant building   Why do you think it will cost millions? Per year? Preposterous. Buildings that are vacant do not cost more to maintain than buildings that aren't.  Also remember: Stadiums are vacant 75% of the time anyway (more for football stadiums). This is why the restaurants across from the Bradley Center couldn't even stay open.
milwaukee,3cx0xz,kapuchinski,9,Sat Jul 11 21:13:43 2015 UTC,"It will stay vacant because it is outdated and has a backlog of repairs that has a price tag of 25-38 million. You aren't going to attract a tenant with its current condition. The taxpayers are on the hook because that is the agreement that we made when it was built. We are responsible for the maintenance of the facility.  The BMO harris needs electrical work, heating coolant work, the atrium and roof leak, fire safety updates, and plumbing to name just a few. We wont have the money to do it all at once so it will be deferred over the years costings a couple million every year depending what repairs are undertaken each year. That is not also including any extra costs that might incur from a major problem causing more damage costing more money (potentially). Wisconsin winters have been bitterly cold a burst pipe could do a lot of damage.  It is the backlog of repairs that have been put off that will cost us millions. Plus not to mention the extra cost maintaining buildings with hazardous materials (the coolant system in some areas still uses Freon)."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,wild_leprechaun,-1,Sat Jul 11 22:02:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you for eloquently elucidating the reasons taxpayers shouldn't be put on the hook for private enterprise. They get the profits, we get the bill. Do you understand how that factors into the stadium question?"
milwaukee,3cx0xz,kapuchinski,7,Sat Jul 11 22:13:07 2015 UTC,"Except with this new stadium we won't be responsible for maintenance, we get a new parking garage that we get half the profits in I believe the first ten years and then full profits but we own the structure.  The reason why we are on the hook for the maintenance is because we own the building. The funds to build it were gifted to the state of Wisconsin by the philanthropists Jane Bradley Pettit and Lloyd Pettit."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,wild_leprechaun,0,Sat Jul 11 22:39:18 2015 UTC,"Except with this new stadium we won't be responsible for maintenance,   No, we're responsible for paying for half of its construction--far more expensive.   we get a new parking garage that we get half the profits   ...for $250 million we get all that?   then full profits but we own the structure.   The very arrangement of responsibility you're terrified about with the BMO. It's even in your next sentence:   The reason why we are on the hook for the maintenance is because we own the building."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,kapuchinski,8,Sat Jul 11 22:58:28 2015 UTC,"You are comparing maintenance of a parking structure to a stadium, that is a huge stretch and a drastic difference.  250 is keeping a venue in Milwaukee that holds a professional sports team and provide arena caliber entertainment to the area in addition to retaining the tax revenue associated with such team and entertainment. In addition assuring the development in the surrounding area for residential and commercial opportunities by the development promised by the Bucks after their initial investment and creation of a new ""entertainment district"".   This development combined with the Northwest Mutual building and the reconstruction of downtown and trolley is easily over a billion dollars of investment into this city. We have an opportunity to really invest and change the downtown which will in turn attract more people to the city and this state.   Look I understand why you are opposed and recognize your points. I just have yet to see any solid plans given on what to do with a stadium that needs lots of repairs if we vote no. Tearing it down will be expensive and I remain unconvinced it can attract any new leasers in its current state."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,wild_leprechaun,-1,Sat Jul 11 23:59:24 2015 UTC,"If there is a backlog to the tune of 25 million, maybe when the board asked Scott Walker if the state would kindly fork over millions of dollars multple times... Maybe they should have spent the money on repairs. Instead, they reworked the skyboxes to generate more revenue, which is pretty stupid to spend millions of dollars to do to a building you are going to tear down. They could have just lowered the price of them instead.  But they dont care, take money from the tax payers, change skyboxes around, profit.  The Bradley Center board is responsible for its condition, and they should be removed from their position, and other people should be put in the position who have the centers best interest in mind."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,littleclick,0,Sun Jul 12 05:19:25 2015 UTC,Especially when those richest people in the city aren't from here and won't be staying here.  The bucks owners could do a whole lot of goodwill if they saw people fighting against it and they found it in their heart and wallet to spend an extra couple bucks to make sure it gets done
milwaukee,3cx0xz,orangutan9,-1,Sat Jul 11 19:50:06 2015 UTC,I think whoever owns the team has to pay for the stadium. Not the taxpayer.  It's like me buying a car and asking my neighbors to pay for my new garage.
milwaukee,3cx0xz,rainnz,4,Sun Jul 12 05:55:05 2015 UTC,"Or it's like the city needing a new arena on a plot of land that won't and hasn't be used for fucking years. And since we are all a community we pitch together and pay taxes for things. That's how it works not your stupid circle jerk analogy. Does everyone get to use your car? Is it a downtown destination that people will flock to and spend time at? God forbid we pay a dollar a year for it instead of whining about the man not buying it for us. Shit, even if they did I'm sure you'd all still oppose it because you don't like sports or some lame shit."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,KillerKlown420,-1,Sun Jul 12 21:34:04 2015 UTC,"Capitalize profits, socialize losses. That's what they want. And that's what I have problem with. Who owns the team? City of Milwaukee? We, the people?   If you bought a team - please make sure they have place to play. Why is it so hard to understand."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,rainnz,4,Sun Jul 12 23:17:13 2015 UTC,Oh they will have a place to play in Vegas or Seattle since the people in those cities are willing to do anything in their power to obtain the Bucks. While we sit here and whine about a dollar and wondering why the rich people don't just do everything for us.
milwaukee,3cx0xz,KillerKlown420,-3,Sun Jul 12 23:22:06 2015 UTC,If the market force decides that Vegas or Seattle needs them - let them go to Vegas. Taxpayers shouldn't subsidize for-profit sports teams.
milwaukee,3cx0xz,rainnz,2,Sun Jul 12 23:27:40 2015 UTC,Then they leave and you're still on the hook as a tax payer for the up keep of the bradley center. I'll go back to a car analogy for you. Would you rather spend $5000 to fix an old car or use it to buy a new one?
milwaukee,3cx0xz,Kenn3y_47,0,Mon Jul 13 01:33:18 2015 UTC,Financially it's always cheaper to fix old car vs buying a new car.
milwaukee,3cx0xz,rainnz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:37:14 2015 UTC,But what about the longevity of the old car compared to a new car?   Edit: saving pennies now can cost you dollars later
milwaukee,3cx0xz,Kenn3y_47,4,Mon Jul 13 21:44:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think the car analogy is good. What about the people who don't own cars paying for the roads you drive on?  Or the people who don't have kids, paying for other children's public schooling?   Sure it would be great if the owners paid for it all, however it's a win/win for the owners if the Bucks stay or not, they have the upper hand in this situation. Also, the tax increase will be minimal. And to all the people complaining that schools should be more funded, then donate to the schools. Donate your time or money instead of complaining that the city should do something. Education isn't failing because of money constraints, it's failing because of lack of community support and administration."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,byronnnn,3,Sun Jul 12 11:24:00 2015 UTC,"What about the people who don't own cars paying for the roads you drive on?

milwaukee,3cx0xz,t3achp0kemon,-1,Sun Jul 12 13:32:27 2015 UTC,"But our subdivision will benefit so much from my new garage. People from other subdivisions will be coming to check it out. Local teens will setup lemonade stands nearby. People would want to move in, demand will be so great that house prices here double in a year. We all need to chip in for greater good (my new garage)."
milwaukee,3cx0xz,rainnz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:56:29 2015 UTC,ok then for your new garage you can only park in it for 41 days of the year. If we're comparing to the new arena.
milwaukee,3cx0xz,Kenn3y_47,2,Mon Jul 13 01:35:32 2015 UTC,I'll rent out my garage to bands to come and play there while my car is not there and keep all the profits.
milwaukee,3cx0xz,rainnz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:34:35 2015 UTC,"Ok fine but you have to pay for up keep of the garage, also if the cost for the garage is over the original cost you have to pay for the over cost. Also you need to pay for high quality landscaping, trees, and flowers around the garage"
milwaukee,3cx0xz,Kenn3y_47,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:58:03 2015 UTC,"I have to do it anyway. I just want my neighbors to pay for my garage, instead of me paying for it. You know, maximizing profit, minimizing cost (at the expense of the taxpayer)"
milwaukee,3cx0xz,rainnz,-2,Tue Jul 14 02:05:08 2015 UTC,"No, it's more like:   I want a Masarati.   So, what I do is solicit funds from another state.   Then I say, well,  I got these pension funds from another state, I deposited them into my Masarati Funds account. Now, I will put 20,000 of those funds towards the Masarati I want. The rest of it should paid for with tax payer dollars.    I want a garage too, so I think my municipality should just build one for me.   I also want to have my friends move here, so the municipality should also give me land, so that I can develop some real estate, and the taxpayers should help me build those properties too.  Also, while the municipalty is doing this for me so that I can have my Masarati, I also own a business that is responsible for over 600 defaulted loans in the same city.  Also, I dont really want to OWN the Masarati, I just want to drive it around and look cool. So the city is ultimately responsible for the Masarati.  Also, if I want to sell my interest in the Masarati, I have the right to do that, so Im going to let 37 other people pay me to drive this Masarati, but really ultimately the city owns it, so if it ever needs new breaks, the city has to take care of it.   Did you notice that my Masarati has advertising on the doors? They actually pay me to drive around with those magnetic ads on there!"
