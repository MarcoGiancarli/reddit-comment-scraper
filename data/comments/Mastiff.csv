Mastiff,3dypda,MeowTown00,4,Mon Jul 20 16:47:12 2015 UTC,Mastiff kisses are the best.

Mastiff,3dypda,daelite,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:57:23 2015 UTC,"Our Mastiff is very picky about kisses. He kisses his ""Momma"" the most, ""Daddy"" second and doesn't have to be asked. Our 20 year old daughter asks for kisses and he will grumble at her...or when she tells him she is going to ""look at him"". It's very cute. Moose is 2 years old."

Mastiff,3e0r6a,amazonian_princess,3,Tue Jul 21 01:54:17 2015 UTC,"It sounds like it's potentially work. As far as budgeting, triple what you think it'd cost. My boy gets skin issues from time to time, and it'll usually be $500-600/vet trip because of his size and the cost of medication. You need to buy double the flea meds. Good food is more important than other breeds. I don't think the cat is an issue, depending on the dog. The amount of walking is more than enough, they're lazy. You should be cautious with the amount of stairs they do regularly. If you live in a multistory home, you'll want to limit it. My biggest concern is it being alone 8-9 hr days. Some mastiffs will sleep that entire time, some will miss their owners. Mine has a doggy friend and they keep each other company. Most mastiffs are pretty quiet because they're lazy, mine only barks when playing. Because I have another dog that cannot be left out, I crate them both. Their crate is big enough that it really requires its own room. Otherwise, he doesn't need much land or space because he's so mellow. And the drool. Don't underestimate the drool. It's on everything. But overall, best dog I've ever had."
Mastiff,3e0r6a,trobo84,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:33:05 2015 UTC,Thank you for the realistic owner answer ! Being at work during the day is the only apprehension to the whole dog thing that I'm worried about. Other people can make it work but I want to make sure the dog is OK with it and not going to go crazy .. Thanks for the tips!
Mastiff,3e0r6a,trobo84,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:32:39 2015 UTC,"If you can, it may help for you and your husband (and maybe roommate if they're involved) to stagger some days off when you bring a dog home so you can make the transition easier. And make sure you find out if the dog is able to be left alone inside or if you need a crate, and then start leaving the dog at short periods and work your way up. You don't want to come home to 9 hrs of destruction and possible accidents (especially if you get a mastiff!)."
Mastiff,3e0r6a,carpecarp1,2,Tue Jul 21 13:25:05 2015 UTC,I second this. We left our rescued 2 year old at home for increasingly longer periods of time to get her used to our being gone. It took a few weeks but now we can leave her home alone for the full work day without any issues at all. Sometimes I come home and she is still tucked in on the couch (she really loves blankets) so I know she hasn't even moved in 8 hours. People are not exaggerating when they say mastiffs are lazy!
Mastiff,3e0r6a,Albator_H,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:30 2015 UTC,good idea! for any new dog in the family :)
Mastiff,3e0r6a,up2late,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:52:10 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of the Boerboel mastiff breed. I would say that's it would fit you well. First they look a lot like English Mastiff, 2nd they have a ""dry mouth"" (you will still see drool but not as much). They are very adaptable to their owners, You are active, they can be too! You want a cough potato, they can be that too lol! They are not an aggressive breed yet they will defend you with their life. Mine is happy as a clam as long as she has access to the couch. I work away from home she has has zero issue being at home while I work.  Anyway look them up, see if that's a match for you! The boerboel AKA the South African Mastiff"
Mastiff,3e0r6a,Beautifuldays,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:05:19 2015 UTC,thanks for the feedback i will have to look into the breed more. im sure they are a hard find at a rescue :(
Mastiff,3e0r6a,Beautifuldays,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:53:50 2015 UTC,"I think you're a great potential mastiff owner. They're great dogs and I've had them for a couple of decades. I've had them in apartments and rentals, I have my own place now with lots of room. As long as you have time to give them love, Go for it."

Mastiff,3dz9hf,FirstTimeWang,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:06:14 2015 UTC,"Had a checkup at the vet last week, got her weighed for the first time in a year (she hates the scale for some reason, hates the whole vet experience honestly). SHE WEIGHED 161 POUNDS! Vet said she needs to lose 20-30 and had me put her on a diet."
Mastiff,3dz9hf,trobo84,2,Mon Jul 20 19:08:10 2015 UTC,"Boone is on a diet, too, since it's too hot to walk too much. He's not loving it."
Mastiff,3dz9hf,trobo84,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:55:21 2015 UTC,Yeah I think that definitely contributed to Coco's weight; a few months ago they started major construction in the park next to my house where i walk her. They've got the main field fenced of and she's incredibly anxious about going to new places.  P.S. saw the new pic of him! He looks great!
Mastiff,3dz9hf,trobo84,2,Mon Jul 20 21:06:23 2015 UTC,"Poor pup, too bad she wasn't socialized properly! I couldn't handle Boone if he was anxious because he's so huge. It sounds like she's come a long way though :)"

Mastiff,3d4tbk,leahdoug,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:39:00 2015 UTC,"She was not thrilled to be in a new place, as usual. But she did eventually have some fun running around in the sand with me, my friends and their dog. She did get to meet a lot of new dogs as well but she doesn't really seem interested in them other than giving them an initial sniff. But that could have also just been the stress of being in a new place with new people.  I'm pretty sure she also outweighed all the other dogs there by an easy 100 lbs.

Mastiff,3d53u8,Hamalicious,2,Mon Jul 13 16:24:54 2015 UTC,Why can't you drive him to the airport yourself? It's only 2 days both ways or just one day if you don't mind driving that much in one day.
Mastiff,3d53u8,ilikeunity,2,Mon Jul 13 18:19:11 2015 UTC,I don't understand your question. I assume you mean why don't I drive to Germany and fly out from there? If that's what your asking; it's because we are permanently moving to the US and have sold our car in prep for the move. I can hire a shuttle to drive my family and dog to VIE or BUD but a shuttle to Germany would be cost prohibitive. If you mean drive to Germany and ship the dog and we fly separately; shipping a dog unaccompanied is cost prohibitive. If he can fly accompanied on the same flight as us as checked baggage it's in the hundreds rather than thousands of dollars.
Mastiff,3d53u8,ilikeunity,2,Mon Jul 13 18:32:11 2015 UTC,"Can you rent a van and ask a friend/pay a friend drive it, drop you and the dog off for your flight in Germany, then drive it back to return it? Might be cheaper than a professional shuttle."
Mastiff,3cwtfs,Jenimem,3,Sat Jul 11 13:38:16 2015 UTC,"Try not to get excited about it by shaking your hand around or giving any indication that could be interpreted as play. This is hard to do, but very important. Make sure there is a sharp NO or tss or whatever your word is.  most importantly - don't worry, she/he is young. If you have a nylabone or something that would be a good idea to keep nearby so you can direct the energy to the toys.   While Sophie was young I let her have her way with newspapers and catalouges that made their way into the mailbox - they want to chew on something fun so let them.  As she got older she only became interested in her bones and rope toys, so all the books and paperwork is relatively safe in the house. Its just a phase."
Mastiff,3cwtfs,dbfpunch2,2,Mon Jul 13 11:16:49 2015 UTC,"dogs play fight and if one gets too rough with the other, they let out a little yelp.   A friend of mine tried this and it worked wonders with her Staffy puppy."
Mastiff,3cwtfs,duxie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:21:21 2015 UTC,I went through the same. be sure not to reward bad behavior.
Mastiff,3cwtfs,myreddituser,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:10:01 2015 UTC,"He's only 9 weeks old. Give it more time. You're doing all the right things. I'd also suggest adding a firm ""Ouch!"" when he bites, give him an appropriate biting toy and then immediately stop play time between you and him and walk away. He'll get it eventually.  Mine was the same way. He was a mouthy little bastard the first few months, but now he's super gentle and wouldn't dare hurt his owners. Keep at it :)  Edit: Oh and if he starts getting it and playing nice with you and letting you pet him, offer lots of training treats and ""good boy"" praise. Eventually he'll understand that biting is bad and cuddles are good."
Mastiff,3cwtfs,DaisyLayz,3,Sat Jul 11 15:03:05 2015 UTC,"If he's 9 weeks old and you've been trying a few weeks it means you got him too young. They learn a lot of life skills from their mother and litter mates, which I think is extra important in powerful breeds. They really should stay together until around 10 weeks. You'll have more work to do, but everything said above is right on."
Mastiff,3cwtfs,trobo84,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:07:11 2015 UTC,We got ours at 7 weeks and I firmly believe this is why he was as mouthy as he was. His Mom and siblings weren't there to teach him no. So we had to become his family. We basically acted like dogs for a while lol. It worked great!
Mastiff,3cwtfs,DaisyLayz,3,Sat Jul 11 16:15:28 2015 UTC,"I got a Boston terrier at 6 weeks once and he's  12 now and still tries to suck on his favorite stuffed animal. He was a tough puppy, but I got my mastiff at 10 1/2 weeks and he was the easiest puppy ever. No issues with the crate or potty training, very little mouthing, etc. the breeder kept them together until around 9 weeks and then gradually started separating more and more. Made an enormous difference! They both turned out to be great dogs, just one had a much tougher transition and was a lot more work."

Mastiff,3c7ll7,trobo84,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:19:31 2015 UTC,"My girl has a really chapped nose. She gets it from submerging her whole face to drink. The vet recommended just using body oil on it to relieve the chapping. If Boone drinks like my girl does, he could be getting chapped lips for the same reason. Vaseline probably will work the same as some oil, but if it seems like too much of a mess try using body oil."
Mastiff,3c7ll7,Saw_a_4ftBeaver,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:19:36 2015 UTC,"Any specific blend? I use coconut oil on my skin, so maybe I'll try that. May be better than Vaseline when he inevitably eats some. He's always put his face in the water to drink, but maybe that and this crazy heat and the stress of being boarded did it. His jowls are still chapped, but he's starting to perk up now and act like his old self, so I'm hoping it'll get better soon. Thanks for the suggestion :)"
Mastiff,3c7ll7,Saw_a_4ftBeaver,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:38:25 2015 UTC,Coconut oil should work.  Also I think the boarding stress is probably a big part of it to. Last time I boarded mine she really came back with a torn up nose. They said she had been rooting around a lot. I think the skin on her nose is shows when she is stressed. Like from the heat right now/fireworks over the last week. It could be his sign of stress.
Mastiff,3c7ll7,lkams,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:18:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, too bad. I boarded him in a place that lets them run around most of the time and is staffed 24 hrs/day and has lots of beds and toys, rather than the places that mostly kennel them. My husky loves it and is always stoked to go and he loved it the trial days, but he's a big mama's boy and I think he just missed me. My husky would probably be cool with me just leaving her there, but she's not nearly as attached. Mastiffs are just big babies."
Mastiff,3c7ll7,lkams,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:24:54 2015 UTC,"good point, stress can induce nervous mouth/ tongue action. could dry out tissue."
