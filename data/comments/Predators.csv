Predators,3e3pkz,c3ndre,6,Tue Jul 21 18:45:30 2015 UTC,nickelback noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.  otherwise it was pretty good though
Predators,3e3pkz,fury26,4,Tue Jul 21 19:01:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, soundtrack is my only complaint. Certainly Nickleback is groan-worthy and the butt of plenty of jokes, but seriously, highlight films are usually set to music with a little more energy than that. Even if the tempo isn't fast, something with more energy. Bonus points if you can set it so that major hits in the music happen with major points in the video (goals, hits, etc). I would really consider using one of the tracks that YouTube makes available for use there - that way it's a licensed track and something you can distribute a little more openly. I can tell you from experience that using a commercial track on this (even on Vimeo) makes it at risk of having the audio muted out from the track if a copyright notice gets placed on it.  But over all, highlight selection was good and cuts were well made though. All around a very solid first effort. Keep it up. I'd love to see more."
Predators,3e3pkz,pwnicholson,2,Tue Jul 21 23:26:02 2015 UTC,Where does one find the tracks that YouTube makes available?

Predators,3e3pkz,AmericanSatellite9,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:45:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback. I wasn't really planning on uploading it (I know about the copyright problems) and wanted to try something with a relatively short song first. It's not really my kind of music. Which songs would work well? I looked at other videos and most of them used songs I didn't even know.

Predators,3dzfnm,reversewolverine,2,Mon Jul 20 20:45:31 2015 UTC,"UFA typically make more than RFA, because in negotiations with an RFA, the team has the better bargaining position. If Smith was a UFA he would have easily made 5 million, especially with the weak free agent class this year."
Predators,3dzfnm,Kidparkinsons,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:06:44 2015 UTC,I understand that. What about 3 years?
Predators,3dzfnm,woodfinx,2,Mon Jul 20 22:58:23 2015 UTC,"I am not entirely sure, but after a certain number of season in the league (I think 5), you become a UFA. Smith would become a UFA in 2 years, so the last three years of his contract he would have been a UFA."

Predators,3dzfnm,AC9231,6,Mon Jul 20 20:06:13 2015 UTC,I think we would wait until after camp to trade him. Make sure the young talent replacing him was NHL ready
Predators,3dzfnm,TweetPoster,2,Mon Jul 20 20:06:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would think so, too. So I guess my hope is that we don't sign him to some ludicrous contract that makes him tough to move. Maybe a 1-year ""show-me"" contract."

Predators,3duvff,woodfinx,2,Sun Jul 19 18:28:02 2015 UTC,I fully anticipate seeing Fiala on second or third line on opening night.
Predators,3dqq18,Meraki_Way,16,Sat Jul 18 15:15:13 2015 UTC,"No need to freak out. This is how arbitration works. Nashville knows he's going to ask top dollar, Smith knows they are going bargain price, they set figures that will land in the middle.  If you are selling a car you want 10K for do you list it at that? No, you list it at 11. If you want to buy the same car you come in at 9.5 trying to get a deal. Negotiations bros and girls."
Predators,3dqq18,woodfinx,3,Sat Jul 18 16:41:56 2015 UTC,"Negotiations are fine but if this goes to an arbitration hearing, the contract will only be for two years tops, more likely one."

Predators,3dqq18,Mahjin,5,Sat Jul 18 15:51:35 2015 UTC,I've always found this argument to be rather silly. Stalberg's contract was obviously too high and we were begging people all season to claim him off waivers.  Everyone on the Leafs and Blue Jackets could mention David Clarkson and claim to be a $7+ million dollar player with this type of thinking.
Predators,3dqq18,mmartinutk,2,Sat Jul 18 18:21:34 2015 UTC,Where's Smith's cup ring? Does ANYONE think the Stalberg contract is good at all?  It's a funny comparison but not representative.
Predators,3dqq18,asphinctersayswhat,7,Sat Jul 18 22:17:52 2015 UTC,"4.75 is a bit steep, but only by about .5. Give him his money."
Predators,3dqq18,tuxfile,8,Sat Jul 18 15:48:47 2015 UTC,And his number is probably inflated for negotiation purposes. He could probably find 4.75 as a free agent.
Predators,3dqq18,Gumpyyy,3,Sat Jul 18 15:51:08 2015 UTC,"I dont agree with this. Seth/Filip/MattyEk are getting paid next year. We have major prospects that could be worth bigger contracts if they pan out.  We need to be conscious of the fact that we should not commit to much money right now.  That said, 3mil is toooo low."
Predators,3dqq18,asphinctersayswhat,5,Sat Jul 18 22:16:50 2015 UTC,I was referring to Nystrom and Stalberg. I thought Nystrom also received a 4mil/yr contract.  I like smith alot and I would put him at 3.75 or 4 million. 3 seems very low compared to some of the rest of our roster for a guy hitting 20 goals two years now.

If you think otherwise, please explain your reasoning for the sake of fun hockey discussion!"
Predators,3dnrii,lithicstudio,4,Sat Jul 18 02:38:59 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but some of the production issues this year can be accounted to his wingers.  He got stuck with the older no-production guys on his wing. Hard to be a playmaker without someone to finish.    He's one of the smartest players I've ever seen. He's always in the right position, always making the right move. He's killer on defense and 2way play too. He definitely has the ability to be a 2C in the vein of Fisher if he can get a little bigger and gets some more favorable linemates.  The good news is, this year he should get paired with folks like Fiala, Watson, Moses and Hodgson so the production issues should get much better."
Predators,3dnrii,asphinctersayswhat,3,Sat Jul 18 04:09:17 2015 UTC,"Lavy loves him (and Lavy knows forwards).  You're also right.

Ribeiro was never going to serve jail time. Even if they went to court and it got nasty, there would not be a situation where Ribs would be a registered sex offender. It was going to be a settlement and settlements don't say anything legally. It's now a PR battle from here. I know there is outrage from the fan base, but when the puck drops, I think people will want to watch hockey. (That last comment is not saying that the charges aren't serious. I just believe people in general will stick to their hockey rather than their convictions for the most part.)"
Predators,3djd68,jdsummerlin12,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:18:56 2015 UTC,It was a civil case. There never was going to be jail time and there was always going to be a monetary exchange.
Predators,3djd68,RedWhiteAndJew,2,Thu Jul 16 22:26:17 2015 UTC,"That was the point I was trying to make.

That's why I hated this talk of ""Well let's just see how this plays out."" There isn't a satisfying payoff for anyone at the end of this story unless a judge said Ribeiro was not liable (and in a civil suit where there is a he-said, she-said, would be pretty hard to do.)"

Predators,3djd68,RedWhiteAndJew,2,Thu Jul 16 19:29:14 2015 UTC,Hmm. This makes me wonder why they requested her account of the situation in detail if they could have settled before that with a non-disclosure agreement. Or the Ribieros decided that was cheaper to settle than to fight it.
Predators,3djd68,inviscidfluid,5,Thu Jul 16 20:07:50 2015 UTC,"IANAL, but my understanding is that is a pretty standard move in cases like this where there's no physical evidence and it's all ""he said, she said"". The goal is to see if the plaintiff's account can quickly and easily be refuted. For instance, if she said something happened when he was actually out of town and that can be verified, the plaintiff's whole case is sunk. It could be that they didn't have any slam dunk proof to refute her claim and decided the easiest/cheapest thing was to settle."
Predators,3djd68,lithicstudio,10,Thu Jul 16 21:12:18 2015 UTC,"IANAL   Yea, I really think you would be better off typing out ""I am not a lawyer""..."
Predators,3djd68,Third_Man_In,4,Thu Jul 16 21:27:57 2015 UTC,It's pretty common...
Predators,3djd68,asphinctersayswhat,2,Fri Jul 17 00:22:54 2015 UTC,IANAL is also pretty common in a sexual assault case.  Poor usage of an acronym is all..
Predators,3djd68,Xanken,2,Fri Jul 17 04:49:05 2015 UTC,That makes sense.
Predators,3djd68,inviscidfluid,2,Thu Jul 16 22:01:02 2015 UTC,"Mike Ribeiro and his wife have settled out-of-court with a former nanny...   Does this mean that he and his wife had to pay a sum of damages? Would they really have written ""nanny has settled out-of-court with Mike Ribeiro and his wife...""?   My understanding is that civil cases like this generally get settled with some sort of monetary damage payment, and usually it's undisclosed terms. We were never going to know what decision was made in this case or whether or not said events happened."
Predators,3djd68,omjf23,3,Thu Jul 16 20:58:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't read to much into that quote. They're simply naming the newsworthy name first. It's very likely that Ribeiro did end up paying some sum of money and were the ones who are on the ""losing"" end of the settlement, but that quote doesn't necessarily mean that. They could have just as easily have said ""the case between Mike Ribeiro and a former nanny has been settled."""
Predators,3djd68,lithicstudio,3,Thu Jul 16 21:17:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah in a way that's sort of the point that I was getting at. They never would have mentioned the unnamed nanny first.   I think it's hard for people to not know what really happened or who ""lost"", but it's not really anyone's business other than those involved in the case. Imagine saying that to the greater population of r/hockey though.  That's my general outlook on him and this case. I don't care. It's not my job to decide what happened, what kind of person he is, or whether or not he should be on the team. Since this case was never going to end in a way where Ribeiro went to jail or anything like that..none of that really mattered to me."
Predators,3djd68,omjf23,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:21:50 2015 UTC,Ahh sorry! Totally misread your post. You were complaining about the same thing I was annoyed at :)
Predators,3djd68,lithicstudio,2,Thu Jul 16 21:25:05 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that civil cases like this generally get settled with some sort of monetary damage payment   That is correct. However, there's a lot of ""he paid her off"" going around, which: money was always going to be the outcome of this case. Regardless as to anyone's feelings on this case, there is a lot of ignorance about how everything works."
Predators,3djd68,tuxfile,2,Thu Jul 16 22:00:22 2015 UTC,No decision was ever made. It was settled out of court.
Predators,3djd68,inviscidfluid,2,Thu Jul 16 23:00:29 2015 UTC,"Does this mean that he and his wife had to pay a sum of damages?   No. You settle to avoid paying ""damages"" (damages are part of a judgment, you settle to avoid going through trial)"

Predators,3djwky,Kidparkinsons,4,Fri Jul 17 00:44:06 2015 UTC,"You're right, they did file, but at least some of that was because it was the deadline to file. Most RFA's that hadn't signed new deals by then filed too. It can be a negotiating tactic to put a timeline on making a deal."
Predators,3djwky,lithicstudio,3,Fri Jul 17 01:08:23 2015 UTC,"I read the dates a few days ago. I hope they settle it soon, first one is on Monday.   Craig Smith – July 20, 2015  Colin Wilson – July 28, 2015"

Predators,3dfzfi,omjf23,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:45:20 2015 UTC,I love the new logo but I'm glad the alternates will still have the old cartoonish logo.   I'm not crazy about the road jersey (which is the color one in the AHL of course). The home jerseys look really good but I don't like the navy blue with light blue on top of the arms. I thought the last road jersey was awesome personally.
Predators,3dfzfi,KakunaUsedHarden,3,Thu Jul 16 13:17:24 2015 UTC,Is that a full light blue third with the new logo on the far right? Because I'd be all over that like white on dice

Predators,3d712q,schwagsurfin,6,Tue Jul 14 01:15:48 2015 UTC,I liked him but but I don't think he was a must sign.
Predators,3d712q,3_Mighty_Ninja_Ducks,6,Tue Jul 14 00:56:05 2015 UTC,"It's also a 1-way contract. That would basically guarantee that one of the prospects in Milwaukee wouldn't get in. I think that was the biggest factor in letting him go. I mean, I wouldn't want to compete with Fiala/Arvidsson/Watson for that spot. I would much rather be guaranteed it If I was him, and now he is."
Predators,3d712q,Meraki_Way,3,Tue Jul 14 02:03:22 2015 UTC,"As replaceable as he is/was, the fact that we couldn't give him 875,000 is sort of ridiculous. Maybe there is more to the story that he wanted longer terms with Nashville, but if that isn't the case then that's kind of lame."
Predators,3d712q,HomeRahn,11,Tue Jul 14 01:09:07 2015 UTC,"This was about a roster spot, not salary"
Predators,3d712q,pwnicholson,3,Tue Jul 14 04:35:05 2015 UTC,"This.  Also, why pay someone 875k for a seat in the press box (depth) when you can have a cheap goon in the AHL?  I mean, this is the proverbial ""XX for a bag of pucks"" deal."
Predators,3d712q,joshandjuice,3,Tue Jul 14 12:06:22 2015 UTC,"My brother had a baseball coach that would threaten to trade players for a ball bag. Not the balls, just the bag.

Predators,3d712q,AmericanSatellite9,2,Tue Jul 14 12:49:57 2015 UTC,"So I guess management is sure about one or more of Fiala, Watson and Arvidsson. We essentially waived him because the face-puncher we got back is useless. We could have scratched him if the others were outperforming him. The way we throw money at 3rd and 4th liners, it can't possibly be economics."
Predators,3d712q,OCCUPY_BallsDeep,2,Tue Jul 14 16:36:18 2015 UTC,I think that's it exactly
Predators,3d712q,pwnicholson,8,Tue Jul 14 17:31:52 2015 UTC,It's also crazy to me that we couldn't get at least a 7th round pick for him.
Predators,3d712q,Nickinator96,4,Tue Jul 14 01:29:03 2015 UTC,"exactly. I am fine with losing him, but get a better return than an AHLer"

Predators,3d712q,HomeRahn,3,Tue Jul 14 02:55:10 2015 UTC,"My guess is that we weren't going to sign him, asked where he wanted to go, he said Toronto (he grew up loving that team) and we engaged Toronto who aren't in the business of giving up picks right now."

Predators,3d4vpr,tuxfile,3,Mon Jul 13 16:31:16 2015 UTC,I think he does pretty well for emergency call up situations. I kind of forget how stacked our D is sometimes. What's our bottom pairing? Ekholm and Ellis?
Predators,3d4vpr,tuxfile,7,Mon Jul 13 16:39:00 2015 UTC,Probably will be this year.  I don't see Jackman and Jones bottom pairing.  But it's more like 2a/2b.

Predators,3d27u3,Meraki_Way,19,Sun Jul 12 22:50:41 2015 UTC,Surely we could have gotten something like a pick or maybe a pick.

Predators,3d27u3,seanm6614,2,Mon Jul 13 02:52:30 2015 UTC,"He's a tough guy from what I can tell. We have so much more talent than him, so he is almost certainly going to be in Milwaukee."
Predators,3d27u3,tatrtalk,5,Mon Jul 13 01:54:50 2015 UTC,"Really disappointing move. The NHL as a whole has moved on from goons and enforcers. If you're gonna be a fighter you have to contribute elsewhere as well. Taylor Beck was an excellent player, hard worker, and in my opinion, a great example of Predator Hockey. I like players who when I'm their shift, never stope skating. And Taylor was surely that.  I hope he does well in the rest of his NHL career."
Predators,3d27u3,Kidparkinsons,3,Mon Jul 13 04:13:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and the guy we picked up won't be playing in Nashville. He'll play in Milwaukee at best and MAYBE spend time in Cinci.

Predators,3d27u3,j-awesome,3,Mon Jul 13 15:05:15 2015 UTC,"Not sure Devane will result in anything other than an AHL slot.  Tough to see Beck go for that but unfortunately...or maybe fortunately... we are in a situation where we had too many players and he found himself on the outside.  I just feel the role he filled and where he would have fit was better filled by others, hopefully Borque continues to impressed and Watson can step up but it really is a good thing to see how much depth we have gotten to make this trade expendable and its good for Beck now he can truly get his shot in the NHL with a depleted Leafs roster and prove himself."

Predators,3d27u3,thomascryanjr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:37:11 2015 UTC,"Poile must have some connections to Toronto's management. I know his father, Bud Poile, played for the Leafs for a few years. It seems like we make a lot of deals with the Leafs."

Predators,3cxyz3,LiterallyNotChicago,7,Sat Jul 11 20:56:59 2015 UTC,"Trenin looked fucking huge. He is listed as 6'2"", but he looked as big as Diaby, who is 6'5"".  None of our recent draftees looked lost out there, and the only big difference in talent was between Fiala and Arvidsson, and the rest of the group."
Predators,3cxyz3,Kidparkinsons,3,Sat Jul 11 22:21:37 2015 UTC,I thought Vesey looked really good out there as well.
Predators,3cxyz3,CognitioCupitor,5,Sat Jul 11 22:49:06 2015 UTC,oh ya. forgot about him
Predators,3cxyz3,Kidparkinsons,4,Sat Jul 11 23:02:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Trenin is massive!  Saros had a bit of a tough day, but he faced a lot of good shots and the defense didn't help him much. Hopefully he does well in the system."

After the game in which Vancouver eliminated the Preds, I was walking in the players' area by the locker rooms with some family members(dad works for team). We are walking down the hallway and just as we pass this huge door labeled ""x-Ray"" it starts to open up. It's 6 foot 1 Joel Ward wearing absolutely nothing except spandex shorts. We told him great series and he said something like thanks guys. It was pretty funny and unexpected."

Predators,3cu6jt,lithicstudio,19,Fri Jul 10 20:24:03 2015 UTC,"Pardon my language here, but fuck this. I think Daunic does well as a radio host, but he is just not an exciting play-by-play guy. I struggle to pay attention when he calls games, just not interesting enough. He only changes volumes, doesn't ever sound excited. Its really odd to me, and difficult to describe.  I also think Stu Grimson is terrible. Is he knowledgeable, yes, but he is terrible in the booth.  That is all. Sorry for the negativity"
Predators,3cu6jt,mrmacdougall,6,Fri Jul 10 20:44:25 2015 UTC,"Can't say I am in disagreement.   I just wish Tom Callahan would return. He was by far my favorite radio play-by-play announcer.

I always saw him taking the TV role once Pete/Terry wanted to move on. Maybe he was tired of waiting around and went and did his own thing."
Predators,3cu6jt,fuzzy_brows,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:18:27 2015 UTC,"Do you think having his commentary on television, where you're actually watching the game, will help with that at all? I could understand not wanting a boring guy on radio, but when watching on TV, all I need is a guy to tell me who has the puck. I can see the excitement for myself.  I agree with you on Stu ""Effectively"" Grimson. If we could get a guy like Chris Mason to ""effectively"" replace him, it would make this transition a little easier. His bench interviews were always top notch. Matched only by Hutton."
Predators,3cu6jt,SignedUpToUnsub,3,Fri Jul 10 21:07:23 2015 UTC,"I love listening to hockey on the radio, more than any other sport that I enjoy. For someone to be good at hockey on the radio, they need to paint the picture and get you excited so that you can visualize whats going on. Willy never did that. Weber and Crisp, when they were together, you didn't even have to look at the TV and you knew what was happening and it was all described perfectly. I don't think being on TV is going to change Willy's style and I think it is going to be a detriment to new fans and people trying to get into the games. I am going to watch regardless, just with the volume lower than years past."
Predators,3cu6jt,mrmacdougall,2,Fri Jul 10 21:20:15 2015 UTC,"I see. Well, on the bright side, you got Petey back on the radio now. Having only heard Willy when he filled in for Pete on TV a couple games a season or two ago, I'll reserve judgement and give him a shot.  If excitement is what we want, we have the guy for the job in Milwaukee--Aaron Sims. I hope he'll get his chance soon."
Predators,3cu6jt,SignedUpToUnsub,2,Fri Jul 10 21:29:28 2015 UTC,"I disagree on Pete and Terry. They would go off on random tangents about the old days in the middle of play. Not a bad thing in TV but drove me batty on the radio. I wanted to yell at them ""tell me what's happening on the ice!"""
Predators,3cu6jt,pwnicholson,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:48:38 2015 UTC,Agreed that Willy might do better in the TV where he has to talk less. He still struggled to keep up with the place of the game caning play by play on the radio
Predators,3cu6jt,pwnicholson,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:47:15 2015 UTC,The obvious move would be striking Stu from the team since he is a terrible color analyst.

Predators,3cu6jt,subcinco,4,Sat Jul 11 03:04:54 2015 UTC,"Relevant quotes:     The “Voice of the Predators” Pete Weber will move into the Preds’ radio play-by-play role and Willy Daunic, who was behind the radio play-by-play mic in 2014-15, will move into the television play-by-play role.      and     Beneath the Ice presented by Nissan, which debuted in October 2014 with a look at James Neal’s adjustment to his new team in Nashville, will return for a second season in 2015-16. Giving fans an inside look at the daily lives of Preds players both on and off the ice, Beneath the Ice will offer even more in-depth coverage during the upcoming season.     Other interesting tidbits - TV ratings were up 80% and the highest they've ever been. The Preadtors team site ranked in the top 15 of NHL team sites in January for the first time ever."

Predators,3cu6jt,AmericanSatellite9,3,Fri Jul 10 20:26:53 2015 UTC,So...no more Pete on TV? We have Willy and Stu? I don't know much about Willy Daunic since I watched on TV and never listened on the radio.

Predators,3cu6jt,XScotX,2,Fri Jul 10 23:11:56 2015 UTC,They're forcing us to either listen to the radio or come to the games to enjoy them. Somewhat /s

Predators,3cu6jt,pwnicholson,2,Fri Jul 10 23:32:59 2015 UTC,"[Unpopular opinion puffin] - Willy isn't great but IMO Pete isn't a good play by play guy either. He was serviceable for play by play on TV but poor on radio.  He is one of the best color guys in the business though. As someone that listens to radio often, I hope he can switch gears to calling the game on the ice and not reminiscing all the time.   My dream team: Tom Callahan for play by play, Pete Weber for color. Jeremy Gover in the studio.  Fire everyone else."

Predators,3cpmru,tuxfile,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:59:47 2015 UTC,I'm down.  What about potential locations?  Saucer is pretty close to the stadium and thus centrally located?  Or that Taver 96 place? But the food options are limited.
Predators,3cpmru,BlueLineMenace,3,Thu Jul 9 20:31:11 2015 UTC,IMO tavern 96 is overpriced. And I'm still pissed at them from last year for when they advertised that they're THE location to watch the draft. They waited until we picked at 11 and the Neal trade happened. Then they muted all tv's and played live music.
Predators,3cpmru,tuxfile,2,Thu Jul 9 21:39:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think downtown is a good place for a meetup to watch a game. It's out of city center, but Corner Pub Midtown or Brentwood, or Broadway Brewhouse South, are much better options. (We did one at Ford Ice Center last time, but it involved a lot of legwork.) We can also do a pre-game meetup at one of your suggestions. We did a pre-game at Bailey's and it worked out pretty good."
Predators,3cpmru,BlueLineMenace,0,Thu Jul 9 23:15:59 2015 UTC,"I haven't been to either, are they all ages? We have some young'ns in this sub too!"

Predators,3cpmru,AmericanSatellite9,3,Thu Jul 9 20:02:25 2015 UTC,"Our policy for this is everyone is welcome to any meetup where we're not playing the team of the outside fan, and if we are, we recommend against it. Just don't be a dick, pretty much."
Predators,3cpmru,BlueLineMenace,2,Thu Jul 9 23:09:04 2015 UTC,"I treat people how they treat me. I think that's fair? Besides, what is to be mad about if we're talking hockey? Ultimately I don't think any of us hate anyone else we just hate the opposing team."
Predators,3cpmru,_jamesgary,2,Fri Jul 10 00:31:18 2015 UTC,"I had this idea stuck in my head ever since I read your comment  If/When we have a meet-up, I do hope you go, because I like you :)"

Predators,3cpmru,_jamesgary,6,Thu Jul 9 21:32:26 2015 UTC,We can hate the Blues together but you also have to admit that Patrick Kane scored with too many men on the ice and that it changed the series :)
Predators,3cpmru,BlueLineMenace,4,Thu Jul 9 21:56:20 2015 UTC,"Well, exactly how many is too many? I mean, who is to say? 5,6,7... numbers are confusing sometimes."
Predators,3copsy,omjf23,10,Thu Jul 9 15:32:41 2015 UTC,"I'm admittedly very biased, but is anyone else a little uncomfortable with No. 11 being worn again? I know Legwand wasn't a particularly prolific forward, but he did put in A LOT of time in Nashville."
Predators,3copsy,tatrtalk,5,Thu Jul 9 15:35:16 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly. Wonder if Hodgson would be willing to change if/when Leggy retires and Preds wanted to retire the number.
Predators,3copsy,OCCUPY_BallsDeep,4,Thu Jul 9 15:37:30 2015 UTC,I suppose the number could still be retired when Legwand retires. I at least hope Hodgson doesn't bomb the season in that number..
Predators,3copsy,alexkendig,4,Thu Jul 9 15:46:56 2015 UTC,Yeah. I'm not too pleased with this. I was hoping Legwand would come back for a ceremonial final season and we could hang his sweater up top. Way she goes I guess.
Predators,3copsy,matt5605,10,Thu Jul 9 15:37:38 2015 UTC,I wouldn't even mind Legwand retiring the Alfredsson way. Sign a one-day contract and warm up with the team wearing his jersey one last time.
Predators,3copsy,tuxfile,3,Thu Jul 9 15:50:41 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way. Our first big draft pick. A very important figure in our line-up for years. But if they're gonna retire it, they will someday so there's that. If they never retire it the number is gonna get worn sooner or later so we might as well get on with it."
Predators,3copsy,j-awesome,3,Thu Jul 9 19:47:11 2015 UTC,"I was a huge Legwand fan and still am.  Got his jersey and still wear it.  So I'm super biased on this, and I realize he's still playing but I think it should've been an unspoken thing of not using that number."
Predators,3copsy,tatrtalk,3,Fri Jul 10 01:29:20 2015 UTC,I'm a big Legwand fan too. I have five jerseys with his name on it. I wear my gold one to the games.
Predators,3copsy,TweetsInCommentsBot,8,Fri Jul 10 02:02:25 2015 UTC,"Not really. Despite the kind of term he put in, he's really not going to get his number in the rafters."
Predators,3copsy,AmericanSatellite9,2,Thu Jul 9 16:14:40 2015 UTC,"Kinda, but the chiefs still use 88. So whatcha guna do?"
Predators,3copsy,wrxie,4,Fri Jul 10 04:55:05 2015 UTC,Here are other new player numbers.

Predators,3copsy,wrxie,13,Thu Jul 9 15:38:05 2015 UTC,No mention of Moses' number? Can he PLEASE wear number Ten just so I can make Ten Commandment jokes? Please? POILE PLEASE!?
Predators,3copsy,wrxie,3,Thu Jul 9 16:20:46 2015 UTC,I don't want number 5 to be unlucky for Jackman like it was for Delzaster.
Predators,3copsy,Bout5beers,5,Thu Jul 9 15:57:31 2015 UTC,Geoffrion wore it. Bad luck didn't really find him until he wore 57 for MTL.
Predators,3copsy,wrxie,3,Thu Jul 9 16:01:24 2015 UTC,I just learned that he wore it yesterday. It was before I was a hockey fan and I didn't really know that.
Predators,3copsy,zellthemedic,2,Thu Jul 9 17:30:15 2015 UTC,I bought his jersey like three months before he got traded :(   Now he doesn't even play anymore.
Predators,3copsy,wrxie,2,Thu Jul 9 17:36:53 2015 UTC,I read he had an accident.
Predators,3copsy,zellthemedic,4,Thu Jul 9 17:53:41 2015 UTC,Skull fracture due to an incredibly rough hit. He could have died.   It was during the lockout in 2012-2013. He continued to play in the AHL and then that happened.

Predators,3copsy,wrxie,2,Thu Jul 9 18:10:52 2015 UTC,"At first I thought you were referring to Andy Delmore, then I remembered we actually had Del Zotto briefly."
Predators,3copsy,Gumpyyy,2,Thu Jul 9 16:08:25 2015 UTC,It's hard to forget for me. We gave away Klein for that mistake.
Predators,3copsy,AmericanSatellite9,3,Thu Jul 9 16:11:21 2015 UTC,I miss Optimus.
Predators,3copsy,Gumpyyy,2,Thu Jul 9 17:31:01 2015 UTC,"You say that, but I specifically remember a vast majority of people here in this sub Klein hating a few years back."
Predators,3copsy,AmericanSatellite9,2,Fri Jul 10 12:49:28 2015 UTC,It wasn't me. He was the first player I liked when I started watching hockey.
Predators,3copsy,wrxie,2,Fri Jul 10 13:19:54 2015 UTC,"Me too, because he and I have very close birthdays."
Predators,3copsy,The1calledLabz,2,Fri Jul 10 13:21:07 2015 UTC,"It hasn't really hurt us, although I wish we could have gotten more for him."
Predators,3copsy,j-awesome,2,Thu Jul 9 16:49:11 2015 UTC,"I really don't know why we traded Klein. I guess they hoped to get more goals from a defensemen, but Klein was significantly better than Del Zotto"
Predators,3copsy,wrxie,2,Thu Jul 9 17:16:03 2015 UTC,He was using the wrong hand wasn't he?
Predators,3copsy,j-awesome,2,Thu Jul 9 17:31:23 2015 UTC,"yep, lefty/righty situation, and Del Zotto was possibly underperforming in New York. Then we didn't really use him here. Didn't fit the system.   Bad trade, but not like we're hurt from it."
Predators,3copsy,wrxie,2,Thu Jul 9 17:40:11 2015 UTC,"That's been the case against Franson and Del Zotto from opposing fans, ""You weren't using him right,""  Bugger off."
Predators,3copsy,Jonesey07,2,Thu Jul 9 17:48:30 2015 UTC,"It's not that we didn't use him right, it's that we didn't use him. He was scratched every night."
Predators,3copsy,TweetPoster,2,Thu Jul 9 18:33:28 2015 UTC,"I remember DZ being a constant scratch, I was trying to stretch my comparison a bit."
Predators,3clj71,EorEquis,18,Wed Jul 8 21:07:37 2015 UTC,"Jackman had spent his entire 13-year career with the St. Louis Blues but felt Nashville was the best fit for him when weighing his options during free agency. He wanted to go somewhere where he had a chance to win the Stanley Cup, and that was the biggest part of his decision in moving his family.  ""I think just the chance to win right now,"" Jackman said. ""We've talked about the strength of the defense, the best goalie in the League and a lot of very exciting, young forwards with a good group of older guys too that are playing very well. I think the style of living, too, is a big draw for me and my family."""
Predators,3clj71,AmericanSatellite9,20,Wed Jul 8 21:07:58 2015 UTC,He is saying everything that I like.
Predators,3clj71,NOODL3,9,Wed Jul 8 21:29:21 2015 UTC,I just wish he'd talk more about how people should move to Nashville. hint hint
Predators,3clj71,AmericanSatellite9,5,Wed Jul 8 23:24:54 2015 UTC,You're adding to the list of things I like to hear :)
Predators,3clj71,Gumpyyy,7,Wed Jul 8 23:32:27 2015 UTC,Sat pls
Predators,3clj71,AmericanSatellite9,3,Thu Jul 9 00:17:20 2015 UTC,Aww you guys. I'm still looking into my options to visit during the season and to move down their there permanently.  Morning after edit: their -> There. Wow I was tired last night
Predators,3clj71,G_Daddy2014,2,Thu Jul 9 00:30:55 2015 UTC,Pls. I have season tix. I'll take you to games!
Predators,3clj71,AmericanSatellite9,2,Thu Jul 9 02:12:31 2015 UTC,Oh my goodness :)))
Predators,3clj71,G_Daddy2014,2,Thu Jul 9 02:13:00 2015 UTC,"Why are you in Wisconsin? If you don't mind, and what are your ties to the Preds? I've seen you a bunch in the sub since I've been here (early this year)."
Predators,3clj71,AmericanSatellite9,2,Thu Jul 9 02:17:25 2015 UTC,"I'm from Wisco, but I am living in Minneapolis amongst the filthy wildling. I just graduated college in December and I applied to all sorts of jobs in Nashville but had no dice, I guess no one was willing to take a risk on relocating an entry-level marketing student.  As for my ties to the Preds: When I was a freshman in college I lived with guys that played hockey all their lives and we would have NHL marathons and I didn't have a particular team, so I just decided, hey I will cheer for whichever team is the Admiral's NHL affiliate since I grew up about an hour and a half from Milwaukee (never went to any Ads games though). Fell in love with Preds almost immediately because I love good goaltending and Rinne is, well, good.  Thank god the Ads weren't affiliated with the Oilers.  Ninja edit: Also why you see me here a lot: I live vicariously through everyone in Nashville and I get really bored at work so I'm on here a lot. Long story short: I live on this sub."
Predators,3clj71,omjf23,7,Thu Jul 9 02:20:56 2015 UTC,"I'll take ""Things you can say to make fans instantly love you"" for $500 Alex."
Predators,3clj71,zellthemedic,7,Thu Jul 9 13:27:38 2015 UTC,"I like his attitude right now. It's a very temporary attitude, but the fact he chose us...I like it."
Predators,3clj71,reversewolverine,3,Wed Jul 8 21:50:30 2015 UTC,"Whats temporary? He came to Nashville to win. He will be a part of one of the best defenses (in front of an elite goaltender) where he will get to play a lot of pk and help mentor and support young offensive guys in Jones and Ellis. It's an exciting opportunity for him where he knows his role and I bet he'll enjoy his new city. I don't think this changes. I think were getting to be a free agent draw at this point and bet a lot of players would feel similarly coming to Nashville.   I'm glad to have him and these free agent interviews only made me more excited for this team.  Also, Moses chose Nashville despite many suitors"
Predators,3clj71,zellthemedic,-1,Thu Jul 9 17:34:02 2015 UTC,"It's temporary because if we crash at the end of the season again, or just have a bad season in general, he won't resign. Simple as that."
Predators,3clj71,lithicstudio,3,Thu Jul 9 18:30:38 2015 UTC,Except he signed for 2 years.  He'll be 36 when his contract is up.  It's entirely possible these could be his last two years.
Predators,3clj71,reversewolverine,3,Thu Jul 9 20:03:09 2015 UTC,And our roster should still be putting us in contention for year 2
Predators,3clj71,Jonesey07,5,Fri Jul 10 13:21:45 2015 UTC,I like what Hodgson had to say as well.   I think Cody may be the most overachieving free agent signing of the season.
Predators,3cl10i,Bout5beers,4,Wed Jul 8 19:02:53 2015 UTC,I like this guy.

All my friends have super serious gfs so they're too busy. My gf works as much as I do and is asexual. Just conversation; no cuddles. Relaxation involves me chasing my ferret around the house for a few hours before bed. Lol getting worn.
Predators,3cjqox,TwitchN,3,Wed Jul 8 19:43:00 2015 UTC,"Asexual gf?  None of my business but does an asexual gf have no sex at all or just not into it?  Basically will she help you sleep if you get my drift?  Like ""ok let's get you off""?  This is a poorly phrased honest question."
Predators,3cjqox,notheebie,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:20:13 2015 UTC,"She has no sex at all and doesn't really understand the big deal about it. Think about it like, some of your friends are really into a certain tv show/video game that you think isn't fun, a very big deal, and you don't want to spend your time watching/playing because of such. Same thing here. Depending on the degree that you don't enjoy the tv show/video game contrasted with the amount you like hanging with certain people, then you might occasionally watch it with them, since they like it. Lol, but I'm not going to suggest doing something I know someone doesn't like. Think of it like you have a friend that's a vegan. You're not going to (seriously) suggest that the two of you chow hound on a dead cow at Outback. Same thing.   She doesn't have any sort of sex drive. It's kinda strange since she looks like a porn star, if you get my drift. We both have insomnia, so melatonin or nyquil helps us sleep, haha. Or my ferret since most of the time I'm on the couch."

Predators,3c8nx7,Skippy1813,21,Sun Jul 5 22:56:40 2015 UTC,"Trust me, no one hates you. Hatred here is reserved for teams like the Blackhawks. Then we use what's leftover for the Blues. If you're going to be a fan, you already hate Chicago. They may be neutral to you for now but after they've knocked you from the playoffs a few times and keep winning cups, the hatred will fester.   I'm also not sure if this sub is that protective over the Titans. I like them personally, but nowhere near how much I love the Preds. I'm not a huge football fan. The subject doesn't come up in here much.  So players: your team captain is Shea Weber. Big guy, tough, and second-hardest slapshot in the league. Our goaltender is Pekka Rinne, 6'5"" Finnish wall of awesome. Huge fan favorite. Assistant captains are Mike Fisher and James Neal. Our most promising younger player right now is Filip Forsberg.   There are a few traditions but I'll let someone else go into those details.  Overall Preds fans are welcoming. The fans at the games are generally civil and courteous, and I think it's safe to say most ""physical disagreements"" that occur at the games are instigated by the visiting fans (alcohol usually being a factor) but it's rare for that to break out. Bridgestone Arena is an awesome venue. Going to the games and seeing all the gold in the stands, that's when you really feel it. The pride of being a fan of the Preds and an amazing city.  EDIT: If you are new to hockey, don't just watch the Predators. Watch other teams if you get the chance. It may take a while for the rules of the game to sink in, but once you do, you won't have to think about it. It starts to feel natural. There's a lot going on so there're a good bit of subtleties."

Predators,3c8nx7,omjf23,3,Mon Jul 6 19:48:49 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest though. Chara get's an advantage with that stick and his size. Considering Weber got to within 0.3mph of Chara's record with a shorter stick and mass, I'd say that's an accomplishment in itself.  Weber is also more consistent and accurate with his slapper though. Much handier for game day."

Predators,3c8nx7,MysterManager,2,Mon Jul 6 16:14:12 2015 UTC,"It is cheaper to buy two years of season tickets, or two years of half season tickets to Preds than one year. If you only plan to attend a few games a year it's cheaper to just buy single game tickets. If you like football Titan games are fun, it's NFL football so watching any team is fun to me. If they are bad like they were last year you can buy a ticket dirt cheap to a Titans game, a 300 way up top somewhere, and still sit 40 feet away if the lower bowl because most people don't show up when they suck ass. It may be different this year with Mariota there, we shall see."

Please don't buy a goose call and blow it every few minutes during a game.   If a player scores four goals during a game, Wendy's gives out a free Frosty to anyone who brings their game ticket into a restaurant the next day. If the Preds win with a shutout, you can show your ticket (home games) or the Preds' social media post (road games) at Dunkin for a free doughnut. And when the Preds win at home, you can also get a free hot/iced coffee from Dunkin.  Smashville is incredibly friendly and welcoming, even to opposing teams' fans. As long as you're not being an asshole, you'll fit in just fine.   Gnash is the mascot, and he's a total badass. He's probably the best dancer among all NHL mascots and whoever runs his Twitter is hilarious. Bridgestone has live bands play between periods, and sometimes they have pretty big names.  Try to avoid engaging with Preds ""fans"" on the Preds' official facebook page or any fanpages. Quite a few people on there are closed-minded/obsessed with Chicago/completely ignorant, and there's way too much circlejerking going on for any productive conversations to happen.

Screw those guys. Rinne is one if the top 3 goalies in the world.  Weber is your big name but Josi may be even better than him. Forsberg got shafted on Calder voting last year.

Predators,3c8f01,Meraki_Way,5,Sun Jul 5 21:37:33 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I expected as much from one of Wilson and Smith, but not both. I'm a little surprised Beck is electing arbitration.   What are the chances we really can't afford Wilson and Smith together? It would take Nashville deciding to walk away from re-signing them to let one walk."
Predators,3c8f01,omjf23,7,Sun Jul 5 22:15:49 2015 UTC,It's binding arbitration. We'll be able to afford both. The bad part is all the mud slinging that can happen if it gets to an actual arbitration hearing.  Negotiations can continue up until then so we don't have to have Poile sit in the room with his player and list all the reasons he sucks and isn't worth too much.
Predators,3c8f01,pwnicholson,6,Sun Jul 5 23:48:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Hopefully this gets dealt with soon. I'm a fan of both, but if I had to choose, personally I'd choose Smith"
Predators,3c8f01,omjf23,6,Mon Jul 6 00:04:32 2015 UTC,"The only reason why I would choose Wilson over Smith is that Wilson is are only real power forward, and besides Kamenev, we don't have any more in our system (maybe we got some in the draft. I haven't looked too far into our draft selections)."
Predators,3c8f01,Kidparkinsons,6,Mon Jul 6 00:13:33 2015 UTC,That's a valid point. My argument for Smith at this point is simply that I feel like he has a better history of consistency.
Predators,3c8f01,omjf23,5,Mon Jul 6 00:19:09 2015 UTC,"This is a fun game, I go with Smith too. I think he's really earned his top 6 spot over the last three years and Willy sometimes earns pine in a very frustrating manner. I root for Wilson, and he can be great sometimes, but you're right. Consistency is king."
Predators,3c8f01,notheebie,2,Mon Jul 6 07:11:31 2015 UTC,"Hypothetical choosing is nonsense.  They have the space to keep both, they complement each other, and they will not find equivalent replacements on the open market.

I think if he doesn't generate good offense in the first 40 games we could see him get a lot of health scratches.  Weber: still good  Craig Smith: a good year for him to prove himself, another sink or swim situation. He's surrounded by talent and if he can't flourish in it then where can he?

Predators,3bvtfd,KakunaUsedHarden,6,Thu Jul 2 16:19:53 2015 UTC,"He wouldn't want to sign longer than that. It's a bridge deal to get him from RFA to UFA status. He's reasonably valuable to the team and I'm sure Poile wouldn't mind offering him a moderately low value long term deal, but he's banking on being able to earn more on the UFA market than he was valued as an RFA.

I agree most TV commentators would call whatever line Neal is on the 1st line, but in terms of ability and lead scoring I think it could come from either of those top two lines.  That said, I've always like Smith and Wilson together and think with a dependable Fisher in the middle it could help them turn loose a little more. And The Forsberg, Ribs, Neal line is what really clicked early in the year last year. bring it back! I'd go here for the top two: Forsberg, Ribs, Neal Wilson, Fisher, Smith"

Predators,3bwcyz,tuxfile,2,Fri Jul 3 16:23:29 2015 UTC,Sharp isn't good enough in the short term to justify giving up four or five more years of Smith's guaranteed 20 goals. Just no. Sharp is 32 and on a huge decline.
Predators,3bwcyz,alexkendig,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:42:14 2015 UTC,Huge decline that was a major contributor to 3 cups and multiple successful seasons. Plus look at our contracts and the roster we're putting together. Looking at a serious cup run within two years. I'd take Sharp. Plus Smith is clumsy and probably wouldn't crack the top 6 on about 10 teams in this league. Sharp would

Predators,3bt05r,KakunaUsedHarden,4,Thu Jul 2 01:30:18 2015 UTC,"I would have been very content with  Hellberg backing Rinne. Hutton is great but he isn't a quality NHL backup, not very consistent. Should probably try his luck at broadcasting."
Predators,3bt05r,thomascryanjr,2,Thu Jul 2 05:01:25 2015 UTC,We don't need him really. Hutton will be around til Sarros is NHL ready.
Predators,3bt05r,J1FP,9,Fri Jul 3 20:01:10 2015 UTC,Seems like we just gave him away. Not sure how I feel about that. I don't know what we would have traded for at this point but..still.  Edit: traded for in the since of a package deal for something better.
Predators,3bt05r,omjf23,6,Wed Jul 1 22:19:22 2015 UTC,This doesn't seem like anything...but if he was an RFA who we weren't going to sign then it's better than nothing
Predators,3bt05r,KakunaUsedHarden,4,Wed Jul 1 22:25:02 2015 UTC,There were too many goalies in play this offseason. That's too bad cause we may have gotten a much better return on him.
Predators,3bt05r,lithicstudio,2,Wed Jul 1 22:53:56 2015 UTC,"Milwaukee Native here - I have no clue why management kept Mazanec over Magnus.  They are enamored with Maz for some reason, while down in Milwaukee the guy is a sieve more often than not. Mags is TALL, quick, smart, and more consistent.  I dislike this trade very much, and hope to see Juuse Saros own the AHL this year."
Predators,3bt05r,Nashwaukee,3,Thu Jul 2 15:49:29 2015 UTC,I'm a huge Maz fan but I'm not sure why he got the gig ahead of Hellberg. Besides his injury season Hellberg seems to have a lot higher ceiling. But who knows what's going on behind the scenes; it's clear the org loves Hutton as well when I'd rather Maz or Hellberg get the backup this season.
Predators,3btk5a,lithicstudio,2,Thu Jul 2 01:03:33 2015 UTC,"Said a lot of interesting stuff in the 15 minute version of the video.    He and Lavy both agree that they ideally want Hodgson at 3C and to move Ironhook to the wings Kamenev will definitely be in Milwaukee (I might just be behind the 8-ball here, I know his contract with Metallurg was terminated so I assumed he would be, but I haven't seen that we signed him) and will definitely be a center and not an LW He reinforced that he expects Watson to be in Nashville and our top three centers in Milwaukee to be Sissons, Reinhart, and Kamenev. He drafted Reinhart's dad when he was with the Atlanta Flames, which is cool After he gets the remaining RFAs signed he said is happy with our team and expects to be pretty quiet for the rest of the summer"

Predators,3bsk7k,wrxie,6,Wed Jul 1 20:24:08 2015 UTC,"more C.  We still have no one listed at RW on the Predator's official roster page. I think Hornqvist was our last official right winger.   Yes, I'm aware centers often play wing as well."
Predators,3bsk7k,omjf23,4,Wed Jul 1 20:58:16 2015 UTC,"I think Steve Moses is a natural RW, so if he makes the team we'll finally have one."
Predators,3bsk7k,white_hart_lane,3,Wed Jul 1 21:02:56 2015 UTC,You are correct. I have no idea where anyone from the farm system is going to fit if we sign all of ours RFAs. I would imagine Poile will do anything to keep Wilson and Smith. We'll see. Hopefully neither goes into arbitration.
Predators,3bsk7k,omjf23,3,Wed Jul 1 21:06:18 2015 UTC,I don't want either one of them traded.
Predators,3bsk7k,wrxie,2,Wed Jul 1 21:16:01 2015 UTC,"Someone more ""in the know"" would have to go in more detail here.   As the cap space stands, I'd say we have plenty of room to sign both of them. The problem is with the internal cap. I'm not even sure that Nashville has one, but I'm more than willing to bet we do since Nashville has always been a budget team.  Like I said, I think Poile will do everything he possibly can to keep both. Does anyone have an idea of what Wilson and Smith will want? I know they are RFAs so they don't have quite as much power to negotiate."
Predators,3bsk7k,omjf23,3,Wed Jul 1 21:28:20 2015 UTC,I think the question becomes more for next year. Will we have money for Forsberg and Fiala and whoever else is up.
Predators,3bsk7k,wrxie,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:15:54 2015 UTC,They'll each want at least 4 a year on 4 yr deals. Maybe 5 mill per.
Predators,3bsk7k,small_L_Libertarian,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:26:16 2015 UTC,I have a hard time seeing either get $5M.
Predators,3bsk7k,omjf23,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:30:16 2015 UTC,Same here. But I can see the desire to get 5 mill taking one or either of them to arbitration.
Predators,3bsk7k,small_L_Libertarian,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:37:19 2015 UTC,Smith perhaps. Wilson doesn't have the consistency to merit that kinda contract.
Predators,3bsk7k,omjf23,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:50:03 2015 UTC,"I never liked that. We've always had C's playing as wingers but I don't think that's very nice. I mean, they do a good job, but get someone that's what they do and not just converting..  I don't know if I'm explaining this right."
Predators,3bsk7k,wrxie,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:14:29 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean, and I used to feel that way, too.  The more I've considered it though, it's not easy to be a center at the NHL level. Especially one who plays in the top six. So by that standard, it doesn't surprise me that we have so many ""centers"" even though only about 4-5 ever actually play that role.  My question is how many other teams do this? Does every team in the league say ""well he's a natural center, but we feel more comfortable with them on the wing for now""?  Also, I have noticed (at least for us) that a center is more likely to take the right wing as players like Bourque and Nystrom are natural left wings."
Predators,3bsk7k,omjf23,6,Wed Jul 1 21:19:02 2015 UTC,He's still just an AHL guy at this point. Poile thinks Watson makes the team this year so grabbing some minor center depth is definitely a smart move. Maybe he can be the 2C in Mil with Sissons as 1C.
Predators,3bsk7k,small_L_Libertarian,2,Wed Jul 1 20:30:17 2015 UTC,Poile said exactly this.  Reinhart will be behind Sissons.
Predators,3bsk7k,Mahjin,3,Thu Jul 2 02:14:06 2015 UTC,I'm getting all these Reinharts mixed up and was very confused and excited for a little bit.

Predators,3bs059,Kidparkinsons,15,Wed Jul 1 17:57:22 2015 UTC,"Vancouver nearly rioted when they traded Hodgson away in 2012. I remember listening to TSN 1040 in Vancouver on my radio app when it happened and 3-4 hours worth of irate fans calling in about how he had such a bright future. He had just scored 16 goals in his age 22 season.  It is very possible that being in such a bad situation in Buffalo derailed his development a little. I'd like to think this is a very good situation for him. He scored 20 goals in 2013-14, but nobody cared because it's just Buffalo.  He's a steal for $1 million. This is more than ideal.

Predators,3bs059,Nickinator96,3,Wed Jul 1 18:04:48 2015 UTC,"Advanced stats guys can do this better than me, but +/- isn't everything. Last year he was 14th among forwards on his team in ice time but ranked 4th among forwards in shots. His shooting percentage was 4.7%. That's abysmal and likely an outlier. He's far more likely to regress to the mean and shoot better next year.  Point being, he's a serviceable player if he plays like he did last year, but has really good potential upside."

Predators,3bs059,jdsummerlin12,5,Wed Jul 1 18:04:05 2015 UTC,"He's got potential, had a dud season on a poor team this past year. Before that he was putting up 30-40 points with Vancouver and Buffalo. This is a really good deal either way. If he works out, it's a steal. If he doesn't, wasn't much paid anyway.   I am curious about who will definitely be returning next season. I'm assuming Poile's priorities now are Wilson and Smith. Everyone else will likely accept the offers tendered to them."
Predators,3bs059,omjf23,4,Wed Jul 1 18:18:44 2015 UTC,Hopefully a change in scenery revitalizes Hodgson. Hope he does well for you guys.
Predators,3bs059,Quarteg,3,Thu Jul 2 10:27:33 2015 UTC,Was one of my favourite junior players when he played on Brampton. Was a really skilled guy but seemed to have fallen off. Hopefully we can reignite the spark in him like we've done in the past with other FA's.

Predators,3bs059,Jcart665,3,Wed Jul 1 19:23:53 2015 UTC,"No, I think it is a depth move. This also allows us to keep Arvidsson in Milwaukee, which could be a good move for his development"

Predators,3br9qw,alexkendig,5,Wed Jul 1 15:35:34 2015 UTC,"He would have hit free agency though and honestly I wouldn't hold off on signing one of our best players just because of allegations or because he's getting sued (which Poile has known about since last year). Plus, its silly to think that there isn't a clause in his contract that gives the Preds the chance to void his contract once the courts decide a verdict based on fact instead of speculation. So yeah let justice run its course instead of committing to slandering him."
Predators,3br9qw,Gumpyyy,5,Wed Jul 1 16:08:58 2015 UTC,"No one is slandering him. Just discussing the Allegations against him.  Ribeiro can be replaced, I was fine letting him walk and avoiding the headache."
Predators,3br9qw,alexkendig,13,Wed Jul 1 16:11:49 2015 UTC,"He can be replaced but not for the next couple years and not at that price. Among centers he was 23rd overall in points, 13th in assists. Its hard to let that walk especially for 3.5 mil.   And plenty of people are slandering him. Some even threatening to cancel their season tickets...over allegations and a non-criminal case. They're just being sued. Innocent until proven guilty. To say otherwise as this point is slander. Thats why even if you know someone killed a guy the news still has to say ""alleged murder"" until the court reaches a verdict. Otherwise its slander.   (also I swear the tone of this is kinder than it seems. just want to discuss it not pound on the table and stuff)"
Predators,3br9qw,Gumpyyy,-2,Wed Jul 1 16:24:36 2015 UTC,"Innocent until proven guilty.    This case does not work that way. Most want the team to stand pat, until the case is resolved. Thats not slander. Report any slander you see and It will be handled."
Predators,3br9qw,Bocheetus,2,Wed Jul 1 16:27:48 2015 UTC,"Is it possible the contract contains a clause to the effect of ""if allegations are found to be true, X penalty (suspension, removal, whatever) will be enforced"" ?"
Predators,3br9qw,woodfinx,6,Wed Jul 1 17:07:54 2015 UTC,Happy to have him back.

Predators,3br9qw,dixnbutz,4,Wed Jul 1 15:04:51 2015 UTC,"Oh my god. This whole thread is a train wreck. I'm happy. He is a great player still and who knows what's true and what's not. Money hungry people who know ribz past could 100% make up some allegations, not saying that's is the case but it can happen."

Predators,3br9qw,burgerboy5753,11,Wed Jul 1 14:49:16 2015 UTC,"This is great news, I really think Nashville changed him for the better"
Predators,3br9qw,Bout5beers,6,Wed Jul 1 15:14:04 2015 UTC,"I'm happy with it. Whatever did or didn't happen in his past, he's still a good hockey player that makes his linemates better and that's all that matters to me."
Predators,3br9qw,codeyh,4,Wed Jul 1 16:37:29 2015 UTC,Disappointed.
Predators,3br9qw,BenjenGrimes,11,Wed Jul 1 14:49:01 2015 UTC,"There are not too many guys in the league who can set up like him. He was great for us and he is a changed person. Never any complaints from the team and staff this year about him. He was good on and off the ice.  I could not care less about this lawsuit atm. It's not my business. It's his, and it's a part of his past. I want this team to succeed and he will help us do that."
Predators,3br9qw,Gumpyyy,-1,Wed Jul 1 14:50:57 2015 UTC,"There are not too many guys in the league who can set up like him.   This problem isn't instantly gone because of his on ice performance. Hes accused of child rape. this isn't something easily forgotten, I won't forget, unless all accusations are legally proven false, or dropped. Doubtful that happens, due to the nature of the case."
Predators,3br9qw,The1calledLabz,0,Wed Jul 1 16:02:07 2015 UTC,"Just adding to the discussion, I don't think he was accused of penetration until she was 18. What he supposedly did before that though was still disgusting and unforgivable if it's true."
Predators,3br9qw,codeyh,-9,Wed Jul 1 17:41:18 2015 UTC,"So Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson should sign with the Titans, yes?"
Predators,3br9qw,dougie1107,13,Wed Jul 1 14:54:30 2015 UTC,"Well there's the part where there was a video of Ray Rice knocking the girl out cold. And IIRC aren't there pictures of what Peterson did to his kids?  I can't remember if it was here or HF, but I saw someone make a good point. If Ribeiro's camp was really feeling threatened by this case and thought there was any chance he was going to be found guilty they would have likely tried to settle this out of court, but they seem to not be too worried about it. On the other hand, Ribeiro has a history of off-ice issues, so it wouldn't exactly be all that surprising if he was guilty.  All that said, Poile decided to take a small gamble on this guy last year knowing this case was coming and it paid off, so I can see why he's willing to take a bit bigger of a gamble this year."
Predators,3br9qw,golfmade,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:00:35 2015 UTC,Good deal and glad to have him for a few more years.

Predators,3br9qw,Gumpyyy,-13,Wed Jul 1 23:15:28 2015 UTC,"Options:  1- I cancel my season tickets, give up my one joy in life, but keep my soul.  2- I continue to go to games, and fund a possible child rapist.  EDIT: I guess we're just supposed to forget the allegations, then. Heaven forbid we let the courts make their judgement before we sign an alleged rapist. This is bigger than hockey, get some fucking perspective. If you're going to downvote me for talking about it, I welcome them."
Predators,3br9qw,klopfuh,6,Wed Jul 1 15:15:53 2015 UTC,"Let's wait until this pans out. I'm guessing Ribeiro is innocent, seeing as I highly doubt Poile re-signs him without Ribz having a concrete case."
Predators,3br9qw,Gumpyyy,-1,Wed Jul 1 15:20:32 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing Ribeiro is innocent   Our best guess holds no weight, legally. We still don't know what call will be made in court. This can be a PR nightmare, at best. The accusations are horrible."
Predators,3br9qw,klopfuh,4,Wed Jul 1 16:04:08 2015 UTC,That's why I'm saying he is probably innocent. The Preds understand how terrible this can be for the organization. They don't make this deal unless they know Ribeiro is innocent IMO.
Predators,3br9qw,Gumpyyy,-3,Wed Jul 1 16:10:12 2015 UTC,They DONT know what happened and shouldn't go with their gut on this.
Predators,3br9qw,white_hart_lane,10,Wed Jul 1 16:12:44 2015 UTC,Option 3- He actually is innocent and you're happy you respected the foundation of the US justice system that says innocent until proven guilty?
Predators,3br9qw,rewind2482,10,Wed Jul 1 15:18:38 2015 UTC,"Actually it's a civil lawsuit so ""innocent until proven guilty"" doesn't apply there."
Predators,3br9qw,white_hart_lane,5,Wed Jul 1 15:20:18 2015 UTC,So instead we should all assume guilty until proven innocent?
Predators,3br9qw,rewind2482,5,Wed Jul 1 15:22:50 2015 UTC,"Most employers, I imagine, would not look upon an employee that lost a civil lawsuit of this nature very kindly.  My point is that ""innocent until proven guilty"" will not apply here as it does not apply in his case.  Oftentimes civil lawsuits are the only reasonable recourse that a criminally aggrieved party has."
Predators,3br9qw,tuxfile,2,Wed Jul 1 15:36:32 2015 UTC,"No matter what anyone's thoughts on the matter re: the allegations, re-signing him is a PR disaster."
Predators,3br9qw,Gumpyyy,0,Wed Jul 1 15:41:27 2015 UTC,"We should assume its still up in the air, let it be resolved, THEN make a judgement call based on what the legal ramifications are."
Predators,3br9qw,dougie1107,4,Wed Jul 1 15:38:50 2015 UTC,"Ribeiro wouldn't wait that long, someone else would sign him.  *edit: nvm I was reading a different comment chain"
Predators,3br9qw,BenjenGrimes,2,Wed Jul 1 15:41:46 2015 UTC,"I dont know why you're getting down voted, you're right."
Predators,3br9qw,Gumpyyy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:43:10 2015 UTC,Then let him go.
Predators,3br9qw,Gumpyyy,2,Wed Jul 1 15:43:38 2015 UTC,"Thats not how this case works, and I just want justice to go through its process before we commit to a possible rapist. Thats not exactly a tall order."
Predators,3br9qw,white_hart_lane,4,Wed Jul 1 16:06:38 2015 UTC,"It's not exactly a tall order to wait to ruin a guy's life until we know the facts when he is being sued and facing no criminal charges. Anyone can get sued for anything, no matter how bad the allegations are that doesn't change the fact that there is one person seeking monetary compensation, not a man facing charges to be reviewed by a jury of his peers."
Predators,3br9qw,Gumpyyy,3,Wed Jul 1 16:18:18 2015 UTC,"Not signing him is not ruining his life, and the accusations involve him ruining someones life. Wait until the case is over, then make your best call."
Predators,3br9qw,jdsummerlin12,3,Wed Jul 1 16:23:16 2015 UTC,What if it just ends on a settlement?
Predators,3br9qw,Gumpyyy,4,Wed Jul 1 16:41:48 2015 UTC,"That's what sucks most about this, nature of the case means we will never really know. There's no guilty/innocent call made."
Predators,3br9qw,jdsummerlin12,2,Wed Jul 1 16:44:04 2015 UTC,"That is kinda why I have changed my tune on this. We won't know if he is guilty or innocent. There's no way to know if Ribs is truly a creep or if this is a girl who can take advantage of a hockey player who had a rough past to get a cash grab. I wish GMDP had waited but he probably knew this was going to end in a settlement ending this case. As far as PR was concerned, people are going to forget it because they can't know if he truly did it and by the time hockey rolls around, those convictions will fade away"
Predators,3br9qw,white_hart_lane,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:53:02 2015 UTC,You're right. And I'll be disgusted if the court rules he is guilty.
Predators,3br9qw,Kinderraven,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:28:11 2015 UTC,"This is not about justice though, its about liability."
Predators,3br9qw,jdsummerlin12,2,Wed Jul 1 23:45:21 2015 UTC,"I think the downvotes are for the two extremes you gave on the post. Either cancel the season tickets or fund a rapist. Again, as I previously said, we will probably not find out anymore details in this case. What we have now is all we will have. It's your money and you have the right to do with it as you would like, but when you say that you are cancelling your tickets, it sends a message (whether intentional or untentional) telling other fans that they should as well or they are enablers as well."
Predators,3br9qw,inviscidfluid,3,Wed Jul 1 23:28:07 2015 UTC,"In theory, anytime you spend money you are funding a possible anything, but yes I get your point. Your money, you can do what you want with it. I feel the same way about some businesses."
Predators,3br9qw,Gumpyyy,-4,Wed Jul 1 15:21:28 2015 UTC,"In theory, anytime you spend money you are funding a possible anything   But we have heard the accusations from the case. This isn't an out of sight, out of mind situation."
Predators,3br9qw,inviscidfluid,11,Wed Jul 1 16:05:41 2015 UTC,"You can literally file a civil suit for anything. I will use an example for TIL on the front page the other day of a guy suing pepsi for not giving him a harrier jet when he got 7 million pepsi points. I could file a civil suit against you tomorrow claiming that you were involved in a hit and run accident and that I got your license plate number and you owe me $50,000.  I am not saying that he didn't do it, but I will make the following observations:  1) No criminal charges were ever filed. This is either because she never filed a police report or the DA never thought that there was enough to go to trial. It is probably the former.  2) If there is a bit of truth to her story, I would settle out of court if I were Ribiero. Why let this even get filed if there is any truth? you are going to lose in the court of public opinion let alone possibly lose millions of dollars. Settle it for a million (the original amount) out of court with a non disclosure agreement. Why go to court and risk 10 million and let her get to accuse you if you did it? Because you know that you didn't do any of that and your lawyers are supremely confident she has absolutely no case. OOR, he is an arrogant dumb ass that thinks he can get away with anything, but I think he coming to Nashville and begging for a job is not something someone as arrogant as that would do.   I am not saying he didn't do anything. I am saying that it does not make sense to not settle out of court if he did what he is accused of, considering the circumstances. This isn't the logical order of events of a guilty man. You don't risk $10 million to save $850,000 after legal fees to argue over something that you know that you did. Most lawyers are about damage control."
Predators,3br9qw,Gumpyyy,4,Wed Jul 1 16:56:24 2015 UTC,"These comments are old and immature.   So are we just not going to talk about the allegations at all? What do we do if the courts say its all true, and we signed a then confirmed child rapist?  Ribeiro is good, but not so good hes irreplaceable. I don't want this on my conscience, if its true. Stay out of it, until this shit gets resolved. then make your call."
Predators,3br9qw,emokiller24,2,Wed Jul 1 15:20:43 2015 UTC,"Just curious where the child part is coming from. All the articles I've read said she was a teenager when the alleged rape happened, but didn't specify her age beyond that."
Predators,3br9qw,Gumpyyy,2,Wed Jul 1 15:31:05 2015 UTC,12-14 were the reports. Thats a child.
Predators,3br9qw,emokiller24,2,Wed Jul 1 16:17:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, 12-14 is a child. The article I read said that she was ""a teenager at the time"" and that it happened 3 years ago. If both statements are true, then we can conclude that she is no longer a teenager, but was one 3 years ago. That doesn't really align with the 12-14 age range. Do you have an article that states she was 12-14 at the time of the alleged rape?  Edit: Here's the article I read https://www.nashvillepost.com/blogs/postsports/2015/6/30/poile_stands_by_ribeiro_but_sets_deadline_for_center_to_re_sign"

Predators,3br9qw,emokiller24,2,Wed Jul 1 16:26:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks. From reading the article, the incident where he forced his hand down her pants happened in 2012. The incidents before that don't constitute rape. It's very blurry as to whether the victim was a child at the time. Although, if the allegations are true, it won't really matter what her age was."
Predators,3br9qw,BenjenGrimes,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:31:50 2015 UTC,"Who do you replace him with? We can't replace him within the system or in Free Agency. If he gets replaced, we are trading valuable assets guaranteed.   Yes, we ignore the allegations because that isn't what this is about. It wasn't last year and shouldn't be now. No one knows whats true and whats not but Mike. So how can we know? We dont. If you are going to convince yourself he is a rapist and you dont want to fill his pocket so be it. Thats your choice.   He helps our team, he was said to be a great locker room guy last year. Filip loved him and how he helped him develop, he made it easier for Neal having played with him in Dallas and they had great chemistry together.  He is clean now. He has rekindled his relationship with his Wife and Kids. He is doing off ice help for the community. He is doing everything in his power to turn his life around after his troubled past. He helps us and we help him. So I'm happy this relationship is continuing for another 2 years"

Im sure they had LONG and DEEP talks about every little thing possible before Poile signed him last year and this year.  You have to forget about it, this has nothing to do with you personally.

It's a bit presumptuous to threaten to cancel your season tickets for something that you don't even know if it's true yet.   If you honestly still feel like you're going to be a morally worse person for going to hockey games because of one of the players, then don't go. Cancel your season tickets and stream the games online.   All we're saying is that you should wait until the actual truth comes out than doing something rash."
Predators,3br9qw,Gumpyyy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:48:23 2015 UTC,All we're saying is that you should wait until the actual truth comes out than doing something rash.   And that's all I wanted from the organization. The signing seems shortsighted and shows a problem with priorities.
Predators,3br9qw,zellthemedic,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:52:15 2015 UTC,"Their situation is different, though. Civil cases like this can drag on for months longer than it already has. And I'm 99% certain they have far more information about this than we do. They're not going to let a good player just walk away for another team to snatch up for pennies. If he gets found guilty, then I'm sure the organization will do something about it (otherwise it'd be a PR nightmare).   Again, if you feel this strongly about it to the point where it disgusts you to own season tickets, then cancel them and stream games online."

Predators,3bp6ok,KakunaUsedHarden,9,Wed Jul 1 01:52:42 2015 UTC,"Basically the full statement of the bits and pieces that have been coming out today.    He did make us aware of the potential of the civil case last year, but he told us, as he has now, that he’s prepared to vigorously defend this civil suit. The civil suit was filed in March, and at that time and now, we do not think it’s appropriate to comment since this case is in the legal process. I think it’s important to point out once again, this is a civil case and there have been no criminal charges filed or alleged. From our end, after reviewing the case with the National Hockey League and some law enforcement representatives, we’re comfortable moving ahead. With that background, we’ve discussed and we’ve offered Mike a contract.      .     As I sit in this seat where I’ve sat for a long time, it’s very important to me to have integrity and to bring character people to our organization. I think for the most part, I’ve done that here in Nashville, and I think I do have a particular focus on bringing good people to our organization. We do have a good, strong record with dealing with players. Three years ago in the playoffs, [Alexander] Radulov and Andrei Kostitsyn had an off-ice incident and we suspended them from a playoff game. Jordin Tootoo had some problems, and I think we were very encouraging to his participation to get into the League substance abuse program. Jordin has resurrected his career, he had a terrific season last year with New Jersey and he’s signed up with them again. This year, I talked to Rich Clune today, and he thanked the [Predators] organization for all they’ve done. The things that he’s been through, I’m sure that given a second chance by teams like ourselves that he will do just fine; same thing with Brian McGrattan who had troubles earlier in his career. We weren’t with Mike [Ribeiro] during the earlier years, but we’ve seen him as a good person this year, both on the ice and off the ice, and we think that he and his family are doing really well and are conformable here. That’s why we hope to sign him. I applaud him for his efforts for being a good husband, father and family man and I just hope that it continues forever."

He is a very good, big bodied offensive player who is always in the right place at the right time. I'll never forget him showing emotion when the team came up short on a comback bid as the buzzer sounded...showed me that he really cares and has passion.  If you can't tell, I'm a big fan of the guy, and didn't expect to see him back with all of our forward depth in the organization!"
Predators,3bitwm,Nashwaukee,3,Mon Jun 29 16:34:32 2015 UTC,I forgot Gaustad only has 1 year left on his contract (thought it was 2). Hopefully that means Watson can at least have a real shot at a bottom six role next year.
Predators,3bitwm,white_hart_lane,2,Mon Jun 29 17:46:40 2015 UTC,"Since it is two-way next season I wonder if that means he is willing to spend another year in the AHL, which could be useful for us."
Predators,3bitwm,pwnicholson,3,Mon Jun 29 16:09:00 2015 UTC,"I think the answer has to be 'yes'. You generally don't sign a contract that allows for something you are unwilling to do. I'm sure he doesn't want to, but he's obviously willing to."
Predators,3bjt83,jdsummerlin12,7,Mon Jun 29 20:20:04 2015 UTC,"My $.02:  I could make an argument either way. I don't think it's the worst idea to pursue him. Here's why:   Few other centers are available to sign that can play in the first line. Generally speaking, first line centers are players you develop in-house or trade a lot to obtain. Ribeiro was a big points contributor last season.  Said incidents are alleged to have occurred well before signing with Nashville, and all other indicators point to Ribeiro getting his act together since signing here. Nashville has always been a franchise willing to give players who are very serious about reforming their career a second chance.          (Granted we are talking about allegations of an incriminating matter, not substance or alcohol abuse as the case with Jordin Tootoo or Rich Clune). From this link, Poile knew about the allegations when he signed Ribeiro last year. Nothing has really changed within this situation, so whatever damage Poile would be perceived to do by pursuing him this summer...is damage he's already done by signing him with knowledge of said allegations last summer.   Edit: Just so it's clear, I don't support any of the actions Ribeiro is being accused of in this civil case. As a player, I wholly enjoyed watching him play last year, and I'd like to see more of that this next season. If an agreement can't be reached and/or he gets into some serious legal trouble because of this, then last season was a good attempt at rectifying his career in the NHL."
Predators,3bjt83,omjf23,5,Mon Jun 29 20:57:15 2015 UTC,"I think it's a nobrainer: we sign him if he takes a reasonable offer. I agree with the points /u/omjf23 made, and I think that he is innocent until found guilty.  That being said, I don't think we should offer him much more than $6 over 2. Sure, he was nearly a point-per-game player, but he's old and not exactly marketable right now.  Also, I would want some kind of nullification clause without pay if he is found guilty. If he's too hesitant about that clause it could be an indication of his guilt anyways.  However, if all of that criteria is met, I would be pissed if he's found innocent and plays somewhere other than Nashville, especially if it's for $4 mil a year or less."
Predators,3bjt83,VolsAndPreds,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:28:59 2015 UTC,"I agree that he shouldn't be given much more than what we've offered. Ribeiro is 35 and probably will hit a dip in his production soon that won't reverse.   I also don't foresee him taking a contract anywhere else for less. It seems like a dumb spiteful move considering his family has already settled into Nashville.   Not sure about the nullification clause. I don't know enough about NHL contracts to know if this can legitimately been done. Perhaps Nashville already has the rights to terminate his contract (a la Mike Richards) if Ribeiro finds himself in further serious legal trouble.   Edit: Perhaps the Richards comparison was a bad choice. A la Slava Voynov then. That might be the more comparable situation. He's currently under suspension. Regardless of what happens to Ribeiro, the Predators will be able to take the proper action in any case."
Predators,3bjt83,omjf23,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:21:16 2015 UTC,"He can't be found 'guilty' or 'innocent'.  The case facing him is civil, not criminal.  If he's found liable, then he has to pay, but honestly, with how this seems to be developing, they'll settle out of court.    That said, I have a very low tolerance for abuse, sexual and otherwise.  If I had my way, he'd be gone.  But I suppose that's why I'm not GM."
Predators,3bjt83,CaptNemo131,2,Wed Jul 1 00:29:47 2015 UTC,"Offer him a low-ball number, something like 5-6M over 2 years. If he doesn't want it, tell him to come back if he is interested, but we won't offer him anything higher. Also have something in the fine print about allowing the preds to nullify the contract if anything else comes up surrounding Ribeiro"
Predators,3bjt83,Kidparkinsons,9,Mon Jun 29 21:01:11 2015 UTC,Ribeiro has already turned down a 2yr deal for $6M this past week.
Predators,3bjt83,omjf23,5,Mon Jun 29 21:04:44 2015 UTC,"That was the term and $ (6 mill) Ribeiro rejected without a counter offer. His camp also supposedly balked at the inclusion of behavioral clauses in the deal, which is surprising given his legal situation. Another sticking point I've heard is Ribeiro wants more money than Fisher because he's the 1C.   Poile should stand pat and see what Ribs can find on market. It won't be more than 6 over 2."
Predators,3bjt83,small_L_Libertarian,3,Mon Jun 29 21:05:30 2015 UTC,"I say let him walk. Move everybody up a line.  Forsberg-Fisher-Neal. I though when Fisher was feeding Neal last year those two looked great together. Smith-Calle-Wilson, etc... Bring Watson up to center the 4th line. Go after Vermette. There are solutions. One of them being to stop throwing away first round picks and draft a goddamn franchise center, instead of trying to rehabilitate sleaze-balls. Thanks for the points, Ribs, but it shouldn't have to come down to offering contracts to players nobody else wants."

Predators,3bd4s7,Parky_has_arrived,10,Sun Jun 28 02:20:12 2015 UTC,"IMO, the only question about his game is his skating. He played 5-6 games in the NHL 2 years ago but looked a step behind, though he has grown a lot as a player since then. Unfortunately, it looks like he's fallen down our depth chart based partly on our needs and partly on our other prospects. He and Colton Sissons are our two closest centers to making it to the NHL (though not necessarily our two top center prospects, but based on age and experience they could both currently be on the bottom-six of a lot of teams in the league), but it appears Preds management thinks Sissons is better.   With the addition of Calle Jarnkrok last year as our 3rd line center, the huge upsides of Kevin Fiala and Viktor Arvidsson on the wings, and the addition of Steve Moses from the KHL, it looks like it'll be hard for him to find room in a scoring role. With Gaustad and Nystrom pretty much locks for two of our 4th line spots, and Bourque and Beck both getting qualifying offers and most likely fighting for the last spot on the 4th line, it looks like it'll also be hard for him to find room in a checking/defensive role. Add onto that the fact that based on call-ups over the past two season he seems to be below Colton Sissons and Mikka Salomaki on the depth chart, as well as the fact that Pontus Aberg could be a dark horse to make the team in the pre-season as a 3rd line winger, I just don't see him fitting into Nashville's plans in the near future.  Kid really deserves a shot and could definitely be with the big club in a lot of organizations. He's an RFA, so I hope we let him walk so he can find a team that's a better fit for him right now."
Predators,3bd4s7,white_hart_lane,4,Sun Jun 28 02:45:17 2015 UTC,"Wow, you know your shit. Thank you so much man, really appreciate your thoughts. Definitely helps me put him into perspective.   I feel like I owe you something for such an analysis, so I'll give you a picture of the card in question. Hope you enjoy it!  http://i.imgur.com/4YNCUzz.jpg"
Predators,3bd4s7,Nashwaukee,2,Mon Jun 29 06:25:51 2015 UTC,"As a Milwaukee native, I've seen Austin play tons of games in an Admirals (Preds' AHL affiliate) sweater the last 3 years and think that his skating is a non-issue. He is constantly in the right place at the right time and very rarely gets dogged defensively.  To my knowledge, he's a great teammate, and really has a passion for playing hard and winning. To me, I think his bread and butter is scoring goals down and dirty by the net. I really hope he gets a chance to shine in Nashville, and I'll miss him when he's gone.   Awesome card by the way!! Jealous!"
Predators,3bd4s7,Nashwaukee,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:01:15 2015 UTC,"I'm still in disbelief that I pulled the card. The odds!   He sounds like a really great character player. When I was researching him, I read somewhere that he's the type of player best suited for a playoff run. Just a hard working, gritty player - those are some of the best players IMO.   Jealous that you get to see quality hockey. I live outside Toronto and the quality of play is pretty embarrassing here. Nothing to like about it at all. I've always been interested in seeing a Marlies game but their association with the Leafs makes me already not respect them."
Predators,3bd4s7,small_L_Libertarian,2,Wed Jul 1 06:30:45 2015 UTC,"Indeed, Watson is very hard working and gritty - will stand up for his teammates too, no doubt! Very exciting news to hear that Nashville's GM David Poile expects him to be playing in Nashville this season.   Give the Marlies a chance! I don't know what it is like up there in Canada, but the AHL experience here is super fun and chill and just an all around great time. Plus, they have a player that Milwaukee sent over last season, Brendan Leipsic - the little guy can fly and score like crazy. Ahhhh! I can't wait for October so my Ads are back!"
Predators,3bd4s7,KakunaUsedHarden,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:15:45 2015 UTC,He tied for the lead in game winning goals in the AHL last year with 8.
Predators,3bd4s7,KakunaUsedHarden,3,Wed Jul 1 20:47:48 2015 UTC,He's got great potential in EA NHL ...  In terms of real life I think he's just plateaued developmentally. Three years ago he was almost in the NHL. Two years ago a few guys got looks before him on the depth chart and last year he wasn't even given a chance.   I think there's still an outside shot of NHL for him in Nashville but I wouldn't be surprised if he's eagerly thrown into a trade package between now and next years trade deadline. Maybe then he'll see NHL action

Sounds like GMDP is really pushing for a hometown discount, and may also be taking advantage of Ribs' current legal issues to play hardball with him.

Predators,3b43il,jdsummerlin12,6,Thu Jun 25 20:22:29 2015 UTC,I'm not happy about this.  I'm less happy about this than I was about James Neal.
Predators,3b43il,AmericanSatellite9,3,Thu Jun 25 20:32:43 2015 UTC,"Huh, I really liked Neal. Out of curiosity, what were you unhappy about with Neal?"
Predators,3b43il,lgplesgrey,3,Fri Jun 26 05:36:08 2015 UTC,"I have since gone on to apologize for my anger but I will tell you.  Last summer when the trade got announced, I was vocally furious about it in this sub. He had a reputation for being a dirty player while he was with Pittsburgh and for being a pest. I think one of my arguments was, ""It's hard for him to being a 30-goal scorer when he spends half the year suspended for kneeing someone in the head.""  Like I said, I have since gone on to regret this. He completely turned it around in Nashville. There were still some moments of buffoonery but nothing too extreme. I'm incredibly happy about Neal being with the Preds but last summer I was fucking pissed."
Predators,3b43il,AmericanSatellite9,3,Fri Jun 26 11:27:46 2015 UTC,"I promised I would stop hating Neal when he got a hat trick, and he did. But I was extremely unhappy when the trade went down, and I still feel the need to maintain a ""it's been X days without a kneeing incident"" sign."
Predators,3b43il,tuxfile,3,Fri Jun 26 13:17:43 2015 UTC,That would be a nice addition to the white board once the season starts...
Predators,3b43il,AmericanSatellite9,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:27:31 2015 UTC,"Oh, thought you meant you were still unhappy with him. Yeah, he did have quite the reputation in Pittsburgh. He even still has a bad rep, despite the way he cleaned up his act over the past year."
Predators,3b43il,lgplesgrey,2,Fri Jun 26 17:46:04 2015 UTC,"Haha no, and it will always follow him. He could open up a puppy orphanage and donate his entire salary to a pediatric hospital but he would get called for one game misconduct and he would be literally Satan again."
Predators,3b43il,AmericanSatellite9,6,Fri Jun 26 17:52:00 2015 UTC,"Pretty disappointed that he got an offer at all. I wonder if there in language in it stating that if he is found guilty, Preds get their money back and he goes on his way(to jail)."
Predators,3b43il,fuzzy_brows,4,Thu Jun 25 22:36:35 2015 UTC,"civil suit, no jail time on the table"
Predators,3b43il,homeskilet92,3,Thu Jun 25 22:55:22 2015 UTC,Oh that's right.
Predators,3b43il,fuzzy_brows,2,Thu Jun 25 23:16:47 2015 UTC,I would imagine that has to be written into every contract and/or NHL bylaws. I fucking hope so.
Predators,3b43il,white_hart_lane,6,Thu Jun 25 22:45:06 2015 UTC,"DISCLAIMER: What I am about to say below is not a defense of Mike Ribeiro. I am disappointed that even an offer from the Preds has been given to him.  That being said.....  The way Ribs camp has been speaking, it looks like they feel they don't have anything to worry about. They will not accept a one-year deal and they said Ribs will field other offers if he needs to. This type of talk is what a person with leverage has. He isn't laying low. It's like this isn't anything to worry about.  Let me say this again. I don't think the Preds should have offered Ribs anything. I don't care if it is true or not. When you have a serious accusation like that, it hangs over your head. He represents the team and no offer should be given to him until you can be seen as innocent in a heinous crime like that."
Predators,3b43il,inviscidfluid,2,Thu Jun 25 20:29:36 2015 UTC,"I said it before, but he is an idiot if he did what he is accused of and there is enough evidence for him to actually go to  civil court over it. If he had the slightest inkling that he would go to court and possibly lose out of a contract offer, have his career end, get sued for millions, etc, he should have settled out of court. The fact that they are letting this get filed tells me that they are confident that nothing will come from it. That doesn't mean it didn't happen, or that we should sign him just that he could have gotten off way cheaper by settling if there is any basis for this civil case.   You are right though. I don't want him. Same reason I didn't want the Titans to take Jamis Winston. (I realize there was much more evidence against Winston)"
Predators,3b43il,Kinderraven,5,Thu Jun 25 20:44:49 2015 UTC,"This is what I think is going on. And it's my opinion, which means nothing.  GMDP knew of the allegations before we knew them. In the contract negotiations last year, Ribs said these would come out but denied he did it. GMDP hedges his bets and signs a one year deal.  Fast forward to the OTF report. Details come out, but to GMDP it is nothing new. This is exactly what Ribs said would happen, but now there is detail. Ribs is prepared to fight it, so in GMDP's mind nothing really has changed.  Now here is where things get fuzzy for me. The confidence of the lawyers leads me to A) Ribs is confident that he can get away with this or B) He didn't do it, so he is willing to head into the courtroom and face the music. That's a bold move to not sweep this under the rug.   My pessimistic guess on the contract is the only thing that changed for GMDP is the detail of the report. He stands by his signing last year so he feels he is in the clear to offer another contract.  I don't know, I'm just spitballing."
Predators,3b43il,inviscidfluid,4,Thu Jun 25 21:04:12 2015 UTC,"The lawyers are confident, no way in hell you demand she plead her complaint with specificity if you don't believe you are about to lay the smack down.  They could have rode the vague complaint all the way through if they wanted, and no one would have half a clue what was actually going on.  Also if I were her former attorney I would have filed a big ole fat lien on the lawsuit if there was a chance of recovery if she terminated them, which means they probably terminated her. I don't know what happened, no way to really know what happened in this case, but this is not how I would handle a case for a client in the public eye that I didn't have an ace in my sleeve on, especially an athlete since most people think they are abusive rapists already.  That is why I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt here."
Predators,3b43il,inviscidfluid,2,Fri Jun 26 00:37:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah! That's how I feel, but I'm just engaged to a law student. It is harder for me to put things into words than it is for you law folk. But yes, there is no reason for this to be out in the air unless his attorney is supremely confident that nothing will happen."
Predators,3b43il,Gumpyyy,2,Fri Jun 26 00:47:46 2015 UTC,"I agree. To me, if I had Ribs money, I may have settled out of court even if I knew I didn't do anything. It just doesn't make sense to go to court with this over money in a lose-lose situation. I am trying to wrap my head around a situation that I would say, ""okay, try to sue me"" if I were in his shoes. The only one I can think of is if I am supremely confident that I am in the right. Either that or he is just a really cocky asshole that thinks he can get away with anything. Civil case aside, it makes us look like the bad guys."
Predators,3b43il,heyethan,9,Thu Jun 25 21:44:05 2015 UTC,Disgusting.
Predators,3b43il,auquf,7,Thu Jun 25 20:23:01 2015 UTC,"Not saying you're wrong, but just want to get more feedback. What has changed since last season? I suppose more details have come out about the alleged assault, but he was being accused of sexual assault in the middle of the season last year and I didn't see a ton of people calling for his removal from the roster. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, not trying to argue (I don't really have strong feelings either way at the moment), just genuinely curious. If it's true I certainly don't want someone like that playing for my team.   On one hand I think it's important to take accusations like this seriously and not get into victim blaming. On the other hand is it fair that someone become unhireable based on a solitary accusation? One of my favorite musicians was recently accused of rape (falsely-- Conor Oberst. You can look into it but it's almost beyond a shadow of a doubt he didn't do a thing) and suffered huge financial consequences for it.  Anyways, I know ribs has a reputation. Just throwing out some fodder for discussion."
Predators,3b43il,heyethan,2,Thu Jun 25 20:56:21 2015 UTC,We didn't know about it until last week. All we knew was that Ribeiro had been sued for bodily injury by a former employee which honestly could have been ANYTHING - she tripped over a table in his house for instance.
Predators,3b43il,auquf,5,Thu Jun 25 21:06:37 2015 UTC,Ahh. I was under the impression it was called a sexual assault initially. Clearly my memory sucks.
Predators,3b43il,inviscidfluid,4,Thu Jun 25 21:14:12 2015 UTC,"Mine might, but I thought it had been a blogger jumping to a conclusion that that's what bodily harm meant."

Predators,3b43il,auquf,3,Thu Jun 25 23:11:50 2015 UTC,"Playing devils advocate here, have you heard anything besides accusations and ribiero's reputation? Genuinely curious since I doubt they have even done anything but have a case filed. I doubt ribiero has even been served notice yet if this just got filed."
Predators,3b43il,TweetPoster,3,Fri Jun 26 00:55:26 2015 UTC,"The reason that accusations cause uproar is that more times than not they are true or at least part true. Imagine you are an employer looking to fill a position. You have two candidates where one is a B+ and the other is a C-. Before you make your decision, you get a call from a person who knows you are looking to make a hire. She asserts that person B+ molested her child and abused her for about 4 years. It was about ten years ago, there was never a police report filed, and person B+ moved away so he can make a life change.  Now, as an employer, the decision has become more difficult. You know that the claims could be wildly untrue, but someone still made an accusation. That thought is now in your head before you make that hire. Who is it going to be? Can you trust person B+?  Again, accusations can sometimes be unfounded and those people that make false accusations make me angry. But a rumor that someone molested a child is always enough to damage someone's reputation because of the seriousness of that crime. Is that right? No. But this is a PR nightmare for Nashville."

Predators,3b0g5e,KakunaUsedHarden,7,Wed Jun 24 23:44:50 2015 UTC,"I think Weber and Josi split the vote, literally."
Predators,3b0g5e,the_penis_mightyer,4,Wed Jun 24 23:47:02 2015 UTC,Josi + Weber is still 3rd though.
Predators,3b0g5e,golfmade,3,Thu Jun 25 00:59:39 2015 UTC,But Josi being 5th probably took votes away from Weber.
Predators,3b0g5e,matt5605,3,Thu Jun 25 01:43:53 2015 UTC,I seriously thought one of our guys would win something... sigh.

Predators,3b0g5e,Chase1ne,2,Fri Jun 26 09:10:53 2015 UTC,"At first I thought, ""Well, good to see Josi on the list in the #5 spot,"" but then I saw his vote total and realized that the relevant cut off is after #4. I think I read that he might be on a different line next year to try to move out and improve."
Predators,3b0g5e,TweetPoster,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:12:17 2015 UTC,"Karlsson has won 2 Norris' now. Weber, arguably the leagues best defenseman has not won a single trophy. This is bullshit. Weber should of had the trophy last year but once again, bullshit reigns supreme.  But this year, Josi was the better player and should of been in the top 3 if not have won.  Nashville, always getting knocked down when it comes to awards."
Predators,3b1jr5,HomeRahn,7,Thu Jun 25 05:39:59 2015 UTC,I don't trust trades for Leafs anymore.
Predators,3b1jr5,AmericanSatellite9,2,Thu Jun 25 14:02:00 2015 UTC,Yeah......
Predators,3b1jr5,j-awesome,3,Thu Jun 25 15:06:07 2015 UTC,Bozie wouldn't be a bad choice. Especially for a 2nd rounder but that's the asking price. Could probably negotiate down. Maybe get the Phil...
Predators,3b1jr5,Cmrade_Dorian,2,Thu Jun 25 08:04:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think Bozak will be as good as Ribeiro (and I know you aren't implying that), but I really don't know where else we are gonna get a 1C or a 2C. Bozak could be a suitable choice for a trade.   That being said, we don't have a 1st round pick so trading our next best pick might not be in the plans. Our 2nd round pick will be 55th overall."
Predators,3b1jr5,omjf23,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:08:32 2015 UTC,We deal our 2nd (and do nothing else) we don't draft till round 3. Late round 3
Predators,3b1jr5,KakunaUsedHarden,2,Thu Jun 25 15:07:30 2015 UTC,"I have very very little practical knowledge about Bozak, but I'm pretty sure leafs fans generally don't like him and he's overrated by Carlyle's bloated evaluation of him.   So that's a no from me."
Predators,3b1jr5,KakunaUsedHarden,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:09:57 2015 UTC,"From what I hear is his numbers won't be as good without the line he was on this past year, so I'm not sure about him, I just know we're in need of a center and he's available."
Predators,3b1jr5,CannedMango,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:22:04 2015 UTC,"Leafs fan here.    Bazak is actually a good hockey player.  He's good on the draw, has decent hands, can skate, pass and shoot.  Would definitely be a good fit as a second line center.  Also, his contract is reasonable.  The reason he gets flak from the Leafs is not because of the player, but because of the circumstances that surrounded his signing.    Basically, the Leafs bought out fan favorite Mikhail Grabovski so that they could sign Bozak and Clarkson.  Since they were against the cap after that and didn't have any center depth, Bozak became the defecto #1 center, even though, as mentioned above, he's really a #2 guy.    Frankly, if the Leafs weren't tearing it all down, he's a guy I'd want on the team."

Predators,3axwh7,KakunaUsedHarden,8,Wed Jun 24 11:30:33 2015 UTC,"If it was me, I'd run 1 F, 2 D. The D men pairs are used to the longer shifts that they'll need to take and are going to have better chemistry for passing, etc that will be critical. And it's generally the 'safer' option. We have offensive enough D-men that they'll still be more than capable of putting shots on net.   So I'd basically run through the hot fwds for that game with the standard D pairs."
Predators,3axwh7,pwnicholson,3,Wed Jun 24 11:37:43 2015 UTC,I could see us doing a mix of 1-2 and 2-1. Keep Josi and Weber together and pair them up against a Toews-Kane type of line and then do a 2-1 of Forsberg and whoever else against the teams second or third line.
Predators,3axwh7,lithicstudio,7,Wed Jun 24 13:16:22 2015 UTC,"between Eks, Ellis, Jones, and Josi, we have a helluva lineup of offensively-talented dmen. This could work out great for us."
Predators,3axwh7,egot05,6,Wed Jun 24 13:27:35 2015 UTC,Forsberg - Neal - Weber  Smith - Fisher - Josi  Wilson - Ellis - Jones maybe.
Predators,3axwh7,Preds-poor_and_proud,10,Wed Jun 24 11:31:19 2015 UTC,"In the leagues that have used it so far, 2D + 1F has actually worked a bit better in 3v3. Which is awesome news for us. Get our talent on the ice."

Predators,3axwh7,white_hart_lane,2,Wed Jun 24 12:50:05 2015 UTC,"Josi-Fisher-Jones  Fiala-Forsberg-Ellis  Moses-Smith-Weber/Ekholm  Josi and Jones with that much open ice will have the puck in the net in about 17 seconds. If for some reason they hit the post like 80 times or something and can't score before their shift is over, Fiala's speed and Forsberg's skill will be dangerous.  Speed is key for open ice, so Moses could he really dangerous as well. Even though Weber is better than Ekholm, Ekholm's skating would probably give him the advantage, though we'd probably just put Josi out there again."
Predators,3axwh7,pwnicholson,3,Wed Jun 24 15:05:50 2015 UTC,"Fiala-Forsberg-Ellis   Heh. Why not go ahead and pull Pekka while you're at it and run another young, scoring forward out there? Would be entertaining, but I have a feeling we'll never see that lineup, even with Lavi."
Predators,3axwh7,white_hart_lane,2,Wed Jun 24 16:27:44 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, I based those on what I want to watch, not what makes sense."

Predators,3ayb5o,tuxfile,2,Wed Jun 24 16:15:28 2015 UTC,I went on /r/keto and the results blew me away.  Then I had some ice cream.  Mostly I'm trying to fit in an XL Preds jersey - the XXL's sleeves cover my hands.
Predators,3ayb5o,Havoc1887,3,Wed Jun 24 16:17:18 2015 UTC,I have a vintage XL jersey and it does not fit me at all. It might be a Large even. I think it was designed to be worn with pads.  Hockey jersey sizes are weird.

Predators,3ayb5o,omjf23,3,Wed Jun 24 14:44:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I actually like yard work. I also used to work for a landscape company at one point, so it doesn't bother me. I would rather be outside doing stuff like that, then setting in an office all day like I do now."
Predators,3ayb5o,omjf23,3,Wed Jun 24 15:01:56 2015 UTC,I didn't like yard work when I was a teenager. Our yard was rather large and my dad has always been the type to look for something to do in/to his yard.   It just feels better that whatever I do to mine is done because I wanted to do it and not because I was involuntarily volunteered for the task.
Predators,3ayb5o,c3ndre,5,Wed Jun 24 15:06:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not terribly looking forward to the awards show tonight.   Maybe Laviolette will get the Jack Adams, but I feel like Price is gonna win the Vezina. I'm still bitter that Forsberg wasn't nominated in the Calder run. I am curious to see who gets the NHL 16 cover. I'm assuming they'll announce that. Watch it be someone I hate like Corey Perry or worse, Andrew Shaw."
Predators,3ayb5o,RlyRlyBigMan,4,Wed Jun 24 14:41:43 2015 UTC,"Price deserves the Vezina, I'm sorry. Pekka is my favorite player in the league but Price is getting the Vezina. I will boycott the NHL if Dubnyk gets more votes than Pekka."

I know about all the 1C talk but with Smith, Ribeiro, Forsberg, and ""hopefully stays a winger"" Wilson, idk if that's our best investment. Should we use the space to ink some long term contracts? Get a lefty shot blue liner?"
Predators,3auk51,flirt77,10,Tue Jun 23 19:11:46 2015 UTC,"Soderberg. I want Soderberg. He can be an effective 2/1 center, and if we get a young center he can take the #1 center role until the young center is ready."
Predators,3auk51,white_hart_lane,6,Tue Jun 23 19:19:23 2015 UTC,"With ya on that one, Soderberg is my #1 choice for us right now all things considered. Especially since Poile's already said we're filling the 6th D spot internally we should reserve our money this summer for offense. We need to sign guys now, but we also want to have room for next year to keep Moses if he's as advertised and then lock up Ekholm and Jones."
Predators,3auk51,OCCUPY_BallsDeep,5,Tue Jun 23 19:25:05 2015 UTC,What about Tlusty? I thought he was a decently skilled center.
Predators,3auk51,flirt77,3,Tue Jun 23 19:53:13 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched a ton of Bruins games, and his scoring numbers don't look all that great. Is that not really his game? What would we be getting with Soderberg?"
Predators,3auk51,flirt77,5,Tue Jun 23 20:03:09 2015 UTC,"He has first line suppression numbers and 2nd line scoring numbers, and was stuck on the third line in Boston. He would be a lower average first line center, but we would also have 3 solid lines."

Predators,3auk51,AmericanSatellite9,7,Tue Jun 23 19:20:46 2015 UTC,"It is a lot, although we have a bunch of players to sign to contracts, so when all our returning players are back we will probably have 15 million in cap space."

Predators,3auk51,lithicstudio,5,Tue Jun 23 19:32:51 2015 UTC,"When Belleskey is a big name there aren't that many. I would say Sekera, Soderberg, Williams, Green and Franson are the only big free agents."
Predators,3auk51,Gumpyyy,8,Tue Jun 23 19:35:13 2015 UTC,Franson lol
Predators,3auk51,Legion991,4,Tue Jun 23 19:46:21 2015 UTC,In the mock draft we got a third round pick for his rights. People are going to want him.
Predators,3auk51,Gumpyyy,5,Tue Jun 23 19:47:51 2015 UTC,"Gotta  sign Fisher, maybe Ribeiro, Smith, Wilson, Jarnkrok, maybe one of Bourque/Beck... and in Milwaukee... Watson, maybe Hellberg, probably Bitetto.  Then next year we have to do Forsberg, Jones, Ekholm, Mazanek, maybe Moses if he works out.    And then of course, Preds have never been a cap team... we sign to an internal budget."

Jones is RFA at the end of next season and maybe the organization doesn't feel that they'll want to pay him (I literally can't imagine that's the case)  If they do feel like Jones is good trade bait, I'd say he's the main piece of a package for a top 3/6 mid to late 20s NHL now player."

I just can't help but imagine what kind of player he will be when he cleans up little things here and there on the ice.  During the playoffs there were moments he looked All-Star caliber, then he also looked like he didn't know what he was doing (making reeeaaaalllly bad passes in front of Pekka during a line change).  But overall I think he will grow to be much, much better than he is now, and he's pretty damn good. Our blue line will be sick!"
Predators,3ax9in,G_Daddy2014,2,Wed Jun 24 14:30:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, the only way Jones gets traded is for a major forward piece that can help us now.  I'd settle for nothing less than a consistent forward in his prime. Trading a projected 1st overall player who is showing strong development for a risk at the 3rd overall doesn't make a whole lot of sense."
Predators,3ax9in,omjf23,2,Wed Jun 24 15:45:08 2015 UTC,"I fully agree, just wanted to hear some other opinions."
Predators,3ax9in,OCCUPY_BallsDeep,5,Wed Jun 24 16:21:21 2015 UTC,"It would be a huge mistake to trade Jones. Kid has so much potential. He's already the second best defenseman at carrying the puck out of the d-zone; just behind Josi. His reach, his size, his skating. I would be so pissed off."
Predators,3ax9in,white_hart_lane,3,Wed Jun 24 12:20:15 2015 UTC,"No way. He's way too good and already contributes too much. It would be cool having a good center prospect, but Marner/ Strome could be years from the NHL. Even if we thought we could lose Seth, which we don't, we wouldn't do it for anyone who isn't a guarantee. He's going to be the best, we would always regret losing him."
Predators,3ax9in,justinbbradford,2,Wed Jun 24 14:56:01 2015 UTC,"Extremely unlikely, but boy oh boy, would I love to see Marner on this team."
Predators,3as3qu,ArturB,8,Tue Jun 23 01:44:35 2015 UTC,"We don't need more wingers, we have plenty of grinders, and we have better #6 defensemen. The 2015 1st would be the only enticing part of the deal, but to be honest all of our right handed defenseman (and our top 2 left handed defensemen) are worth more to us right now than the 19th pick, and the other 3 pieces won't really add any value (Nyquist is good but we have 4-6 guys who could very realistically be just as good or better this year).  I'm assuming you would want Ellis or Jones, which would leave us with a defensive downgrade who costs roughly equal or greater to the defenseman we send to you (Ellis costs $2.5 Million, Jones is still in his ELC- makes it hard to want to spend $2.4 Mil on Kindl), plus 2 more RFAs to sign who don't really add enough value back to make up for the defenseman we lost. We would get a chance to draft a good center with the 19th pick, but we are good enough to win now so wouldn't want to sacrifice our current defensive strength just to shore up our prospect pool.    It's a pretty common fallacy that our defensemen are expendable- we don't have the offensive firepower of a lot of other top teams so we rely very heavily on the fact that our defense kicks ass on both ends of the ice.  Our top 5 are all under contract for ~$16 million next year, and we could probably extend Ekholm's contract for about $1.5 Million more.  Assuming Jones signs a bridge deal to try to go for the money when he's 22-24, we could have the best defense in the world for the next few years for around $20 million total- not bad when you consider a team like Chicago who has $21 million tied up in just 2 forwards.  The only thing that would be worth giving that up would be a kickass center who would make an immediate and gigantic impact now, and I don't think you want to part with Datsyuk."
Predators,3as3qu,white_hart_lane,2,Tue Jun 23 05:19:03 2015 UTC,I understand but you're really undervaluing Nyquist here. You have 4-6 ~30 goal scoring wingers who are not defensive liabilities?
Predators,3as3qu,white_hart_lane,3,Tue Jun 23 16:49:34 2015 UTC,"6 may have been an overstatement. Nyquist's best year he had 28 goals: Forsberg and Neal will both have 30 next year, Smith could bump up from the 23-24 he had the past 2 years and get closer to 30, Wilson should bump up from 20 to around 23-24, and then Moses and Fiala have the potential to reach that level in the next year or two.  Edit: I think I should say that I think Nyquist is awesome and would certainly be one of our best players, I just don't believe he would be worth losing one of our current defenseman. More important than our current talent on the wing is the fact that we actually don't really have a 5th defenseman ready to take the place of any we lose in a trade. We could turn to free agency, but at the end of the day it just doesn't all seem worth it unless we are addressing our true needs which are up the middle."
Predators,3as3qu,Kidparkinsons,3,Tue Jun 23 16:58:24 2015 UTC,"I think the forward would have to be a center. With the Ribiero situation, we are in dire need of a 1/2 center."
Predators,3as3qu,klopfuh,3,Tue Jun 23 01:54:09 2015 UTC,"Centers, centers, centers."
Predators,3as3qu,omjf23,2,Tue Jun 23 06:33:27 2015 UTC,I would be ok with putting Jones in some sort of package deal for a true scoring first line center. No offense but that sort of takes Detroit out of the market. We really don't need any wingers or grinders.

Predators,3ar9kd,G_Daddy2014,11,Wed Jun 24 04:20:04 2015 UTC,"Asking price will probably be too high and we don't really wanna deal our top prospects within our division if we can avoid it.  10.5 million over the next 2 years is a lot of money for a 33 year old who dropped from 78 points 2 years ago to just 43 last year (though he did miss 14 games due to injury).  Better to take our chances on Fiala, Arvidsson, and Moses than to spend that kinda money on another winger when what we actually need is a center.  Soderberg had similar numbers as Sharp last year but on a struggling Bruins squad. He's big, he's a center, and he won't be too expensive. I'd rather see us sign him and continue building our Swedish empire."
Predators,3ar9kd,white_hart_lane,6,Mon Jun 22 22:01:25 2015 UTC,I hope he does well with the Caps

Predators,3a7lih,Kidparkinsons,10,Wed Jun 17 21:20:18 2015 UTC,"No chance we try to sign Oduya, Sekera, or Martin. The cap hits for their previous contracts were 3.375 Million, 2.75 Million, and 5 Million, respectively.  With the two UFAs and all the RFAs we have to sign it would make no sense to spend that kind of money on a 6th D-man when we have the best 5-some in the league already, especially considering Jones and Ekholm need new contracts next year.  We have a lot of good options internally. Bartley has proven himself reliable, Bitetto looked good when he came up and has a similar edge that Bartley brings, Nakyva and Alm both have pretty huge upsides if they can adjust to the North American ice and style, and all four of those guys are lefties."
Predators,3a7lih,white_hart_lane,4,Wed Jun 17 22:16:02 2015 UTC,re-signing Jones and Ekholm next year is a thing I had not yet thought about. We're going to want these two to stay and buying out this year might cripple us. Good insight.

Predators,3a87x6,crazy_canucklehead,3,Thu Jun 18 01:34:39 2015 UTC,"Going to be fun! As for:   /u/crazy_canucklehead said that it might go past the first round   It has the past two years so it wouldn't hurt to grab a 2nd rounder or two if it makes sense. If it isn't confirmed initially people might be willing to give them up more easily too.   As for my personal thoughts on what we should do:   Grab some form of center for the medium-long future (Fisher and Ribiero are both 35). I wouldn't hate someone established either as we are still be a win now team (A guy like Eric Staal is older but his age aligns with Weber and Rinne, also he played a lot of LW for Carolina this year so he could wait to move to C until after one of Fisher or Ribeiro leave). Add a 6th/7th defensemen (either left-handed if he slots in above Bartley, right-handed if he slots in below Bartley as we have no depth on the right side in the AHL to call up). Also Beauchimen is a UFA. Need to move one of Hellberg/Hutton (I'd prefer Hutton move personally but Hellberg could be a valuable piece is a bigger deal). Moving player rights was a big deal last year so we could probably off-load Franson and Santorelli and get something for him.  We have a lot of stud wing prospects that could be moved for solid pieces or swapped for some good center prospect depth (Arvidsson, Fiala, Kamenev, Vesey, Watson, Aberg and Sissons all have value and our current wingers aren't very old/needing to be replaced anytime soon). Might want to add some scoring depth no matter what as our third line is likely Jarnkrok plus two of Arvidsson, Fiala and Moses. Not an awful line by any means but that's a lot of pressure for a group of young guys without much NHL experience. We have a lot of cap room so we can get a little creative with that depending on how strictly that gets enforced.    As of now I've compiled a list of my personal top 30 prospects. I'll up that to 60 tomorrow, in case there is a second round, and PM it to my co-GM's and we can get a consensus list going based on the prospects they like."

His biggest strengths include his ability to compete, his penchant for stopping second and third chance opportunities, and the mental composure to quickly put goals behind him.

Predators,3a1mox,AmericanSatellite9,7,Tue Jun 16 15:52:12 2015 UTC,He will likely challenge Rinne in a couple years. Carried his Liiga team the entire season.
Predators,3a1mox,Kidparkinsons,13,Tue Jun 16 15:53:32 2015 UTC,That is such an exciting thought.  I want Rinne to go into MechaRinne when he gets challenged for his job.  No goals given up through 70 games. Then he'll let one in five-hole because why the fuck not?
Predators,3a1mox,AmericanSatellite9,9,Tue Jun 16 16:47:17 2015 UTC,"Ah.. MechaRINNE.  Legend has it only once a worthy challenger appears will Pekka Rinne finally reveal his final form.  Some say he will merely ascend into a higher plain of being, perhaps fusing directly with the goal to become one with that which he swore to protect.  Others speculate he will quite literally turn into a brick wall.  Ultimately no ones knows, but suffice to say all fans alike await in eager anticipation."
Predators,3a1mox,Bocheetus,4,Tue Jun 16 17:05:09 2015 UTC,We shall see. I just hope the final form won't look like this... ;P
Predators,3a1mox,c3ndre,3,Tue Jun 16 17:27:23 2015 UTC,"He didn't do that great during the world juniors, but had a shutout in his one start at the world championships and kicked ass for his pro team the last couple years. Supposed to be extremely talented, only question is his height."
Predators,3a1mox,white_hart_lane,6,Tue Jun 16 16:11:51 2015 UTC,Not to forget the previous World Juniors where he won gold with Finland. Just a small addition.
Predators,3a1mox,c3ndre,4,Tue Jun 16 16:29:51 2015 UTC,What does this mean for Hutton?
Predators,3a1mox,jackattack615,7,Tue Jun 16 15:19:35 2015 UTC,"Nothing. Poile already said he's playing 20 games next season so unless Saros manages to pull off a miracle, Hutton's still the backup."

Predators,3a1mox,AmericanSatellite9,3,Tue Jun 16 18:50:10 2015 UTC,"Soon that's all we'll have. But you know, if he'll play 20 games this year, that'll be good for Hutts. I honestly think he just didn't play enough."
Predators,3a1mox,wrxie,6,Tue Jun 16 19:00:01 2015 UTC,"Not only is it good for Hutt, but it also means that Rinne won't be fatigued come April/May (hopefully June)"
Predators,3a1mox,AmericanSatellite9,3,Tue Jun 16 19:14:30 2015 UTC,This is what I was saying all last year. Let Hutton play and rest Rinne.

Predators,39xefb,omjf23,2,Mon Jun 15 17:29:35 2015 UTC,He's played in one game for Nashville against St. Louis in 2013 (all of 12 minutes) and allowed 1 goal in 4 shots. He had been named the AHL's Goalie of the month back in February of 2013.  His stats last year in Milwaukee were decent enough. Actually they were slightly better than Mazanec's stats.

Mazanec has had the NHL experience and a good bit of it while Pekka was recovering and Hutton wasn't getting it done. I've always been partial to Hellberg though.

Predators,39wtlz,AmericanSatellite9,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:34:39 2015 UTC,"Flip of the coin. I love Jones and I think he's great, but I seem to remember a LOT of our powerplays having a pass back to the point and he would misplay the pass and we'd have to clear the zone.  Honestly, it could have gone either way. I'm also not thinking straight due to FO4 hype."
Predators,39wtlz,AmericanSatellite9,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:40:34 2015 UTC,Ha. Man I should get that. I've never played Fallout before though. But I also popped my COD cherry on the PS4.

Predators,39wtlz,j-awesome,0,Mon Jun 15 16:45:30 2015 UTC,I wish I did more marketing at my job. I just send emails and make phone calls. I miss doing strategy and looking at those variables.  I'm sorry I turned your RANK thread into this :(
Predators,39wtlz,ThErEaLsLiMsHady223,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:49:00 2015 UTC,Urg I just wanted to talk to someone so I could procrastinate my shit. Not like people are actively going to town on ranks so maysil right.   Shit hit the fan like 7 months ago when we had a BOGO promo on paint and someone was like hey let's do basket analysis on this and learned that we lost like ... I don't remember the exact number but we didn't make up anywhere near enough on a basket and it was a huge failure.   Then someone was like hey maybe we should start doing analysis on our promos. And that's when I got pulled in. It's been fun but sometimes there are so many factors that it makes my eyes turned in.
Predators,39wtlz,AmericanSatellite9,2,Mon Jun 15 16:58:38 2015 UTC,Switch Jones over Ekholm and I totally agree.
Predators,39wtlz,ThErEaLsLiMsHady223,2,Mon Jun 15 16:27:21 2015 UTC,"It was a real toss-up between those two, really. If you asked me again tomorrow I might switch them. On some days I might even throw Jones at number three."
Predators,39wtlz,AmericanSatellite9,2,Mon Jun 15 16:31:37 2015 UTC,"I feel ya, there were defiantly points where Ekholm out performed Jones."
Predators,39wtlz,strudel_mcdoodle,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:33:24 2015 UTC,Switch Nystrom with Bourque

Predators,39c5i6,tuxfile,3,Wed Jun 10 21:50:30 2015 UTC,"I used to think of myself as a hockey fan, until this season when my team got eliminated and I realized I don't give two shits about who wins the Cup now. As long as it's not the Hawks."
Predators,39c5i6,infinitevalence,2,Wed Jun 10 21:57:12 2015 UTC,"I care, but I can't stomach watching the Hawks right now. I'm keeping my fingers crossed and checking the score afterwards."
Predators,39c5i6,omjf23,2,Wed Jun 10 22:03:26 2015 UTC,"wait, hockey is not over yet?  I thought it just kinda stopped after the first round."
Predators,39c5i6,AmericanSatellite9,2,Thu Jun 11 05:17:07 2015 UTC,"I'm semi-invested in the finals right now. The last time I was super emotionally invested in the SCF was in 2011, Bruins vs Canucks. I was going to be so upset if Vancouver won the Cup, I hated them so much that year. I vividly remember watching game 7 with my friend at his apartment.   Every SCF since has been hard to get into for me. I saw an article the other day about how hockey fans are extremely tribal when it comes to the postseason. A lot of potential viewers drop out when the finals come around. I don't care to watch just any team.   I'm tired of seeing Chicago every other year, too. It would be great if Tampa Bay won this year. It'd be a plus to hockey fans of the South."
Predators,391fwr,Gumpyyy,10,Mon Jun 8 15:37:25 2015 UTC,"As much as I'd love to have Kessel, I don't think I'd like to pay for him. If we can't sign one of our RFAs, it might be worth looking at. But our top 6 is pretty effective. I'd prefer to keep everyone."
Predators,391fwr,AmericanSatellite9,3,Mon Jun 8 15:40:05 2015 UTC,Top 5 since we are still looking for that 1C position. :)
Predators,391fwr,pwnicholson,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:17:10 2015 UTC,"If Ribeiro isn't a 1C after last year I don't know what you want. Are there better Cs, sure. But I'd argue last year he was in the top 30 Cs in the league, easy."
Predators,391fwr,klopfuh,6,Tue Jun 9 00:11:36 2015 UTC,"Ribeiro had a great year, but he is NOT a 1C."
Predators,391fwr,pwnicholson,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:32:30 2015 UTC,Who would be? He's a former all-star. Had a great year. Was a top performer in the league. What's your definition?
Predators,391fwr,klopfuh,9,Tue Jun 9 04:44:23 2015 UTC,"Dany Heatley was a former all star, that title means nothing. Mike Ribeiro was tied 42nd in the league in points, that isn't terrible but it isn't 1C material. Also, Ribeiro isn't all that good in the face off circle, which is crucial for a first line center. Ribeiro isn't too strong defensively either, which isn't a requirement, but it certainly helps, looking at guys like Toews, Bergeron, and Kopitar. The point is I'm not saying Ribeiro is bad at all, he's great. But if we look at him and say that our 1C hole is fixed, we're gonna have fucking problems."
Predators,391fwr,egot05,5,Tue Jun 9 05:00:35 2015 UTC,"Also, we can't count on Ribs to hold up his performance from last year as he continues to get older. 35 is OLD for a 1C"
Predators,391fwr,omjf23,2,Tue Jun 9 13:42:56 2015 UTC,"You're right about the faceoffs. It's not one of Ribeiro's strong points, and while winning faceoffs won't win games, they sure do help.   I don't necessarily think a first line center has to be a two-way forward like Toews, Bergeron, and Kopitar, but those are very well-rounded centers. I agree that Ribs is not a prime first line center. It's not that he can't fill that role, but in the sense of what kind of talent we need to reach the finals, we probably need something in addition. A 1C may not be something we can even obtain as soon as next year. The three you mentioned earlier are franchise players, which means our best hope might be Forsberg."
Predators,391fwr,klopfuh,3,Tue Jun 9 14:05:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think a first line center needs to be a two way forward either, I was just saying it helps. Spezza was supposed to be that guy for us and we ended up not getting him, which blows. A 1C is hard to come by in this league, but I can't remember the last team to win a cup without one."
Predators,391fwr,omjf23,3,Tue Jun 9 21:06:49 2015 UTC,"A 1C is hard to come by in this league, but I can't remember the last team to win a cup without one.   You raise an extremely valid potent point there. Looking back on it though, I can't think of many teams who acquired a true 1C through trade."
Predators,391fwr,klopfuh,2,Tue Jun 9 21:22:52 2015 UTC,Again looking at Spezza maybe? Even though Ottawa had Turris and Dallas had Seguin. I looked back through some trades and the closest thing that I saw was when Jeff Carter went from Philly to Columbus.
Predators,391fwr,Preds-poor_and_proud,2,Tue Jun 9 21:45:09 2015 UTC,"Being 42nd in the league in points means that he is definitely in the top half of scoring among top line players in the NHL. 3x30=90. Plus, You'll have some defensemen sprinkled in, so the top 90 forwards are probably sprinkled amongst the top 100 in scoring. The guys you listed are 3 of the top 5 centers in the league. It's really not fair to expect that. They were also all drafted by their respective teams. Those players don't really become available."
Predators,391fwr,klopfuh,2,Thu Jun 11 13:11:44 2015 UTC,"And that's exactly my point. A true 1C is nearly impossible to obtain, but that shouldn't stop us from trying in my opinion. Also I'm not going to sit here and list out every 1C, I was just using those three players as examples of two way 1C's. There is so much more to being a 1C than 62 points."

Predators,391fwr,lithicstudio,3,Tue Jun 9 03:44:46 2015 UTC,I like him and I don't think he'd be that bad of a fit... I just don't like what we'd have to give up to get him in addition to the salary.
Predators,391fwr,Kidparkinsons,4,Tue Jun 9 15:05:25 2015 UTC,"We need a Center. Draisatl certainly could be an option, and Edmonton thinks he is expendable"
Predators,391fwr,white_hart_lane,4,Mon Jun 8 15:41:43 2015 UTC,"Expendable is a huge overstatement being driven by the media. They have no reason to rush to move a prospect just because another more talented prospect will be drafted. Not saying it won't happen, but it won't happen lightly."
Predators,391fwr,Legion991,3,Tue Jun 9 18:23:28 2015 UTC,Leon Draisaitl? The #2 (3?) pick last year might be available?   Rather him than Kessel.
Predators,391fwr,Kidparkinsons,2,Tue Jun 9 01:08:35 2015 UTC,"McDavid and Nuge would push him out of favorability. Several Oilers fans say it would be Draisatl+ for Jones, so if we could get one of their young defenseman (Klefbom, Marincin) plus Draisatl and throw in a draft pick, I think that would a beneficial trade for both teams."
Predators,391fwr,Legion991,2,Tue Jun 9 01:11:28 2015 UTC,Would we only lose Jones in that trade?  That's not a bad trade on paper actually.
Predators,391fwr,tuxfile,6,Tue Jun 9 01:14:31 2015 UTC,"I really don't want to move Jones for Draisaitl at this point. Maybe in a year, if Draisaitl has proven himself in the NHL, but maybe by that point Jones will have already established him as even more valuable a piece than now. Jones + for Draisaitl gets thrown out there a lot, but I don't think it's a good gamble to take even if it's a good value (which I don't necessarily think it is, either)."
Predators,391fwr,white_hart_lane,2,Tue Jun 9 01:34:40 2015 UTC,"100% agree. I'm always so surprised how often I see people in our sub wanting to trade a 20 year old, NHL-proven, superstar-potential D-man, especially for other prospects."
Predators,391fwr,Kidparkinsons,2,Tue Jun 9 18:25:17 2015 UTC,"I have heard Draisatl+ for Jones, not Jones+ for Draisatl"
Predators,391fwr,tuxfile,3,Tue Jun 9 01:36:46 2015 UTC,"I'd do that, but most of the Edmonton fans in trade proposals I've seen treat him as a guaranteed number one (while simultaneously acting like Jones is a bottom pair defenseman. Armchair GM-ing, what are you gonna do)."
Predators,391fwr,Kidparkinsons,2,Tue Jun 9 01:45:49 2015 UTC,"If we could get Draisaitl plus one of their young defenseman (Marincin or Klefbom) for Jones plus something else similar in value to probably a mid 2nd round pick (so our pick plus something lower), I would totally do it.  Edit: Like you said above, I think this trade could happen after next season."
Predators,391fwr,haterbehatin,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:48:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know who those Oilers fans are that are treating Jones as a bottom pairing guy.   I think it'd be more accurate to call him a top 4 guy now with room to potentially be even better than that. Or I'm overrating him?   I wouldn't have any issues with Edmonton adding to Draisaitl to get Jones, depending on the add of course."
Predators,391fwr,tuxfile,2,Sat Jun 13 15:17:16 2015 UTC,"That's definitely not overrating him. I'm pretty high on him, but I'm pretty sure the org's opinion of him is ""as good as Josi with 1-2 more years of experience"". He's not going to be cheap to acquire, if they're willing to move him at all. The problem with moving him for Draisaitl is we'd need an adequate NHL defenseman coming back, and Draisaitl hasn't proven he can stick at the NHL level yet."
Predators,391fwr,haterbehatin,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:35:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I think he's got high upside and might potentially be a 1st line centre but I also think spending a year in the AHL might be best for him. He could have a great camp and make the team though.
Predators,391fwr,Kidparkinsons,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:52:49 2015 UTC,"Ya, I think they would do something like Jones plus our second plus a prospect equal to a lower 3rd for Draisatl and Klefbom.  It works in our favor both now and in the future. We are able to comfortable bring up talent from Milwaukee because Draisatl is still a year or two away, and Klefbom is a sideways move now, but will likely be worse than Jones in the future, but he will likely still be a solid Top 4 defenseman."
Predators,391fwr,Legion991,2,Tue Jun 9 01:17:41 2015 UTC,I'd take that. Jones plus a 2nd round pick for Draisatl+Klefbom.  Draisatl wouldn't mess up any depth in 15-16 season and we could use him when Ribs/Fisher/Gaustad retire or move on.
Predators,391fwr,Kidparkinsons,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:23:52 2015 UTC,It is the one trade for a #1 center that doesn't leave either our Defensive depths or our Prospects pool barren
Predators,391fwr,OCCUPY_BallsDeep,2,Tue Jun 9 01:29:33 2015 UTC,"I hate any trade involving Seth Jones. A big, fast skating, puck moving defenseman who's 20 years old? Keep Leon. A player like Jones is harder to come by. Maybe Poile can use our first round pick this year to get a center...oh wait. We gave a first for Gaustad, so he should be ready for first line responsibilities, no?"
Predators,391fwr,AmericanSatellite9,3,Tue Jun 9 13:03:18 2015 UTC,"Gaustad is really really good at faceoffs so he was, like, one of the qualities of a 1C"
Predators,391fwr,Roughly6Owls,3,Tue Jun 9 15:30:16 2015 UTC,I don't think Edmonton'll be selling on Draisatl before the draft unless they get a massive deal.
Predators,391fwr,haterbehatin,2,Tue Jun 9 21:03:20 2015 UTC,and Edmonton thinks he is expendable   This is definitely not accurate unless you mean he's expendable in the same way that Seth Jones is expendable. Could be had in the right deal.   I personally wouldn't mind adding to Draisaitl for Jones depending on the add. I see you've suggested Klefbom or Marincin as the add though. I think you're severely underrating Oscar Klefbom and viewing him and Marincin as equals.   Klefbom was basically the Oilers best defenseman last year and the difference between Jones and Klefbom isin't Leon Draisaitl.
Predators,391fwr,Kidparkinsons,2,Sat Jun 13 15:21:25 2015 UTC,"What would a trade for Draisaitl and Klefbom need. Would Jones plus our second plus a mid prospect be enough, or would that be closer to the value of Draisaitl and Marincin?"
Predators,391fwr,haterbehatin,2,Sat Jun 13 18:03:38 2015 UTC,I don't think they can move Klefbom at all because that would be creating a hole to fill another hole.   I think Draisaitl and Marincin could work though. Marincin projects as more of a shutdown guy right now but if his offense emerged more he could potentially be a top 4 guy but I wouldn't count on it right now.  I'm sure many Oilers fans wouldn't want to give up Draisaitl at all but I think Jones is one of the few players it'd be worth it for. Exchange of young players still with upside to fill each teams needs.
Predators,391fwr,tuxfile,7,Sat Jun 13 18:37:12 2015 UTC,"Kessel is a terrible fit and Friedman ""automatically assuming"" we were in the mix makes me doubt him as an analyst way more than any dumbness about Pittsburgh does.   Getting Kessel would be great. But he'd be expensive and doesn't answer our actual need."
Predators,391fwr,tekk236,6,Mon Jun 8 15:54:16 2015 UTC,"We were heavy in the mix last time Kessel was on the trade market, but he's not our need anymore. We shouldn't be in the mix."
Predators,391fwr,tuxfile,6,Mon Jun 8 16:47:46 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call into question Friedman's cred. We need forwards, deep Team USA connections...there's every reason to assume interest could be mutual. But he admits the fit is hard to find."
Predators,391fwr,Legion991,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:07:45 2015 UTC,"Not his cred, just the amount of thought he actually puts into his radio hits. But I will admit to going rounds with Leafs fans about potential trades elsewhere, which has made me pretty touchy on the subject."
Predators,3912x4,KakunaUsedHarden,12,Mon Jun 8 13:59:49 2015 UTC,"The Ratings for our players are so bad. Josi is an 86, which is ridiculous, and Fiala is always projected a bottom 6 player. You also have Ekholm as a 78, and Jarnkrok as a 78, as well as Forsberg never develops past a 86. The ratings are so bad that the Maple Leafs won the cup in 2015"
Predators,3912x4,Kidparkinsons,3,Mon Jun 8 14:39:17 2015 UTC,"Yep. Meanwhile Austin Watson is an 86 in year 3 for me. Jones was my second best defenseman in year 2, with Josi and Ellis tied and Ekholm in the AHL. Jarnkrok is a 78 after getting 3rd line minutes all of my first season."
Predators,3912x4,Kidparkinsons,2,Mon Jun 8 14:58:49 2015 UTC,I also play as Buffalo because it is so easy to cheat the system. Under salary cap I had:  94  98  93  91  93  90  89  86  86  84  81  82  90  90  90  88  86  84  94
Predators,3912x4,Kidparkinsons,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:01:21 2015 UTC,ha. Fuck. It wouldn't even be fun anymore.
Predators,3912x4,MarcoEsquandolas21,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:15:33 2015 UTC,I am so happy that they are allowing you to change ratings in the next game
Predators,3912x4,CaptNemo131,2,Mon Jun 8 15:25:49 2015 UTC,"I just looked up the player ratings in NHL 15, and I don't have it (never upgraded from 14) so could only find top 50, but I saw a few things I thought were interesting. There are only 33 players rated 90 or above overall. The rest of the people in top 50 are all at an 89 so pretty close. 89's include Backstrom, Kane, and a lot of other notable players. Only 8 players are rated a 93 or higher. This list includes Quick, Lundqvist, Datsyuk, Weber, Ovechkin, Toews, and Stamkos all at 93, and finally Sidney Crosby at #1 at a 96, 3 points higher than literally every other person in the entire game.   I completely understand that Crosby is widely considered the best player in the league, and it's no surprise to see him at #1 in overall ratings in the game, but having that big of a gap kind of surprises me, especially when other players have had much more postseason success recently. I'm interested to see where Toews places in the ratings next year especially.   As far as Nashville is concerned, I would not be surprised to see a big boost in stats for Josi and Forsberg next year. Hoping they put out an amazing game for NHL 16, everything I heard kind of scared me away from buying 15 but I loved 14 and was hoping to get a PS4 for 16."
Predators,3912x4,AmericanSatellite9,2,Mon Jun 8 21:41:22 2015 UTC,"Because I play 10 minute periods (instead of 5) and the difficulty and goaltending are so borked, Rinne has a .841 SV% and somewhere around 9 GAA.   I think that's not entirely realistic."
Predators,3912x4,CaptNemo131,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:11:39 2015 UTC,I play 5 minute periods but I'm addicted to checking people from behind. Rinne has a .856 and a 4.8 GAA
Predators,3912x4,AmericanSatellite9,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:16:47 2015 UTC,I'll play a game where Rinne will play absolutely lights out then with 2 minutes left in the third there will be a soft shot from the point he'll just watch it go five-hole.  Anger.
Predators,3912x4,thomascryanjr,3,Tue Jun 9 15:32:13 2015 UTC,"The number of softies Pekka has let through is embarrassing. On the other hand, all the goalies I play against look like Vezina nominees"
Predators,3912x4,AmericanSatellite9,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:51:43 2015 UTC,"I'm playing NHL 13 so the first season I still had Hal Gill on my team. I've won the Stanley Cup three years in a row. Fourth season my record is 36-3-1 so far.  The past three Norris winners have been: Hal Gill, Shea Weber, Roman Josi."

Predators,38tfyt,tuxfile,6,Sat Jun 6 17:47:54 2015 UTC,It's hard to believe he wouldn't take a hometown discount to stay here and try and retire in Nashville.

Predators,38opgq,white_hart_lane,3,Fri Jun 5 23:13:43 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more.  The potential is so great.  I can't wait to see what the team brings next season.
Predators,38m1tl,3_Mighty_Ninja_Ducks,12,Fri Jun 5 02:28:28 2015 UTC,"Cody Franson, Obviously we were just using him incorrectly."
Predators,38m1tl,Gumpyyy,8,Fri Jun 5 07:35:08 2015 UTC,I think that trading him for a 1st round pick qualifies as using him incorrectly.
Predators,38m1tl,inviscidfluid,5,Fri Jun 5 14:09:34 2015 UTC,"Watson could push for a roster spot. I think he could get 25-30 points on the 3rd line.  I definitely think Arvidsson will be on the roster next year, and he seems to have the skill to put up 30 points on the third line  Edit: I believe Watson will be in the NHL next year, whether that is with us or with another team"
Predators,38m1tl,Kidparkinsons,4,Fri Jun 5 02:36:34 2015 UTC,"Arvidsson. I'm excited to see him come up here next year, hopefully."
Predators,38jnoc,inviscidfluid,4,Thu Jun 4 17:45:20 2015 UTC,"I think I agree with the grade, but only relative to our expectations from the end of last season. He was a truly fantastic defensive presence, and I'm excited to see what he develops into in the next couple seasons."
Predators,38jnoc,egot05,2,Thu Jun 4 18:59:46 2015 UTC,I think that the plan is to sort everything out with Ribs and Fish and then see how much cap space we have left to keep RSA in the system. I would like to see what he can do next year though.
Predators,38jnoc,egot05,4,Thu Jun 4 19:33:42 2015 UTC,"It's totally possible, but I'd say it's harder for me to imagine a Preds roster in 2015 that doesn't have Jarny than it is to imagine McRibs walking. Jarnkrok is just going to take so much less to keep around, even though his performance is strong enough to deserve his 3C spot. Especially since there don't seem to be NHL-ready non-RFA C's in MKE currently."
Predators,38jnoc,tuxfile,2,Thu Jun 4 20:52:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of that, but I think we are in for  center issues if we let Ribs walk."
Predators,38jnoc,lithicstudio,5,Thu Jun 4 21:25:32 2015 UTC,"We are. Someone had a projected roster on OTF if both Mikes walk, and it is very, very weak at center. But on the other hand, the roster looked solid besides, and if we were forced to skate Neal and Forsberg with Jarnkrok, I think they could make him look like a superstar.  /opinion."
Predators,38hk5i,jdsummerlin12,4,Thu Jun 4 06:48:08 2015 UTC,I wear a jersey from '97. Nobody ever gives you shit for being a bandwagon jumper.

Predators,38hk5i,snophone,3,Thu Jun 4 14:23:23 2015 UTC,Why not? It shows you know your history. If you loved Horny when he was here you shouldn't be embarrassed to wear an older jersey. If I could make sure that the jersey was authentic I would buy it.
Predators,38hk5i,Stevio51,3,Thu Jun 4 12:15:11 2015 UTC,"He isn't a controversial player, he played well for us, enjoyed his time, I don't see anything wrong with it."
Predators,38hk5i,TheresPainOnMyFace,3,Thu Jun 4 14:42:27 2015 UTC,"Go for it. Everyone loves Hornqvist, I'm just not cheering for him because he's on the Penguins. He did well while he was here."
Predators,38hk5i,tuxfile,2,Thu Jun 4 12:35:06 2015 UTC,I frequently browse cool moon jerseys and see that one all the time and debate getting it. I almost have several times and if I didn't already have the Gold Weber jersey then I probably would. So Tap. That. Shit.
Predators,38hk5i,KakunaUsedHarden,2,Thu Jun 4 15:06:06 2015 UTC,"If you like the player, go for it. Fullmoonjerseys is always a good option for cheaper jerseys.  I understand the problem with the prices though. All jerseys I bought were much cheaper (no fakes). That's mostly because I only wear them at home, can't go to games anyway.   However, if you keep looking, cheaper ones (possibly blank ones though) will appear on ebay at some point. You can always ask here if someone wants to sell something, too."
Predators,38hk5i,c3ndre,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:39:44 2015 UTC,I still wear my last generation Horns jersey.  I also breakout my old Hartnell jersey from time to time.
Predators,38hk5i,_w00k_,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:05:23 2015 UTC,"I would in a heartbeat. Hornqvist is an amazing player in his own right, but he was well-loved by the fans despite being under-appreciated in the league for years.   Fun facts:    Drafted very last in his draft class Scored 30 goals and 21 assists in his first full season   Anyone who gives you guff for wearing a Hornqvist jersey is no one you need to be concerned about.   I'm still wearing my Legwand jerseys to the games."
Predators,38hk5i,omjf23,0,Thu Jun 4 20:33:33 2015 UTC,"Personally, No, I wouldn't buy that. I would drop the money on a Forsberg (like I have already done.)  That being said, we are two different people with two different opinions and levels of fandom, so you do what you want!"
Predators,38dw3l,robnaylor,5,Wed Jun 3 16:05:12 2015 UTC,"From the background, it looks like ""AS16"" will be a thing. The NHL seems to be going out of their way to remove any reference to ""Game"" from the event branding. NBA has done this too."
Predators,38dw3l,AmericanSatellite9,4,Wed Jun 3 16:06:30 2015 UTC,I think they are trying to emphasize that there is more than just the game and the entire weekend is the event.
Predators,38dw3l,motherfuckintrex,4,Wed Jun 3 16:10:28 2015 UTC,"Agree. It's new for the NHL - they've always used ""All-Star Game"" as the primary logo and then executed other versions (""Weekend"" ""Skills Comp"") for specific events."
Predators,38dw3l,AmericanSatellite9,4,Wed Jun 3 17:00:24 2015 UTC,Digging this branding all around.

They're good, but I think I went into it expecting too much. If you do go, try to get there just before they start selling their fresh-baked bread...it's sometime in the afternoon.

I've played since I was 4 so I know the positions in and out, where as some of our other players are more casual.   All our games are at 9 PM except Sunday's where there are two timeslots, 5 or 9.

The WHL is known as a physically demanding conference, so scoring there at Kirkland's rate is pretty impressive.

Even if we lost in the first round we could logically argue that we were still the 2nd best team. Especially when we lost the way we did to Chicago. If the team that beat us gets beat, then that team gets beat, etc then we look very poor, objectively, by comparison."

Predators,37rm2m,Kidparkinsons,4,Fri May 29 23:40:07 2015 UTC,"I said this in another thread, but I think we should trade Nystrom. When Nystrom was out, our fourth line played very good. Unless we get really good trade value out of either Bourque or Beck, I would be least saddened by losing Nystrom.   As for the draft, I love the idea of moving up in the draft. I think to get a lower second round draft pick, we could package a couple of our NHL ready prospects that won't get to play next year (Watson, Sissons, Salomaki). I would also be fine using our second round pick in a package to move up, like you highlighted in the article. Parker Wotherspoon would be a great pick with our own second round pick. Moving up, we could be looking at Andersson, Meloche, Pilon, or Dunn on defense.   As for the goalie situation, one of Saros, Hutton, or Hellberg is going to have to go. I would love for our starting goalies next year to be Rinne and Hellberg, and hope for a situation like Bishop vs. Vasilevsky, or Anderson vs. Gibson, where we could honestly entertain the idea of trading Rinne without being hurt in goal (I DONT want to trade Rinne, but it could be a serious topic).

Predators,37cdug,egot05,1 point,Tue May 26 21:29:02 2015 UTC,"Latest I saw on the lawsuit is that the Plaintiff's lawyer withdrew and Plaintiff had not replaced them. This is a really bad sign for the Plaintiff as usually lawyers only withdraw when fired (and thus quickly replaced), or when they don't think they have any chance to win/were looking for a quick settlement rather than actually fighting in court.     I suspect the lawsuit is a non-issue.    EDIT: Looks like the old lawyers put a lien on 40% of any winnings/settlement for being fired without just cause. So now Plaintiff has to find a lawyer willing to take a chunk of the remaining 60%. She's going to have a really hard time finding an attorney who wants to work for a lower settlement and deal with a client who already fired their first attorney."

I'm not disappointed. I look at what he gave us and compare it to what he lost (Hornqvist and Spaling) at roughly the same salary and I think we did great.

Predators,36w8j0,Gumpyyy,8,Fri May 22 17:12:23 2015 UTC,I can live without Cullen. I really don't wanna see Jarnkrok go. If Wilson and Smith wear anything other than gold next season I dunno what I'll do with myself. And I don't think anyone of us will miss Franson.

Predators,36w8j0,omjf23,7,Fri May 22 19:35:04 2015 UTC,"there is not going to be a need to re-sign RFA’s Taylor Beck and Calle Jarnkrok. Moses and Arvidsson can replace Beck and Jarnkrok, respectively   ""Respectively"".....Que? We're going to replace a big 4th line grinder and our 3rd line center for two skilled wingers? I understand we have a lot of new talent to make room for, but I wish the writers would actually pay attention to how the Preds are built instead of just checking a graph of who is under contract and then making generalized assumptions.  Letting Calle walk wouldn't make sense right now- he's not going to be expensive, and with Santo and Cullen most likely not returning, who fills his role? Would we gamble on Sissons being able to fill in? Surely not try moving Wilson back to Center after he finally broke out on the wing? Maybe if we could magically land a true 1C and move Ribs and Fish down to 2C and 3C, but that would be even more more expensive so would defeat the purpose of letting Calle walk in the first place (although that particular option does sound pretty cool).  In terms of Beck, it's certainly possible he's the odd man out for a spot on the 4th line wing, but saying he can be replaced with Moses doesn't really make sense when there are more expensive players in similar roles (see Stalberg and Nystrom). Assuming Fiala, Moses, and Arvidsson are all NHL ready next year, do you really see one of them playing on the 4th line? Doubtful, so one of them probably won't be in our lineup (unless for some reason we don't have Smith and Wilson next year, but considering those are two of the guys we are trying to save money for it would make even less sense to let Beck walk if one of them weren't here)."
Predators,36w8j0,Kidparkinsons,7,Fri May 22 18:14:14 2015 UTC,"After what we gave up for Jarnkrok, I doubt he walks. Also, if Poile had plans of letting Beck walk, it would have been last year. That 1 way contract was to prove he could play in the NHL, and he proved it."

Predators,359a1l,pwnicholson,4,Fri May 8 13:28:10 2015 UTC,Especially since we outscored them 21-19 in the series :)

I love watching the Hawks play - when it comes down to it, I'm a Preds fan first and foremost, as they are the team that got me into hockey.

Hawks will always be my team as they have been for decades. But I want the Preds to do well so I can see them. I had to drive 2+ hours to see games in Florida.  It sucked.
Predators,359a1l,iblamethehiphop,2,Fri May 8 15:45:07 2015 UTC,"I could see that, moving from another place. As a Spurs fan I would never say that ""I'm a Grizzlies fan"", but if I was watching the Grizz play the Knicks, I'd cheer for the 'home' team."
Predators,359a1l,Pure-Pessimism,1 point,Fri May 8 16:06:00 2015 UTC,Exactly.  It sucked going to Panthers games because of the attendance.  The atmosphere was boring. At least Lightning games had a crowd that wss into it. The crowd at Bridgestone seemed pretty awesome for the game I caught.  I'm looking forward to going there and enjoying a few games next year.
Predators,359a1l,SantiagoRamon,5,Fri May 8 20:18:58 2015 UTC,Did an adult hockey clinic tonight at Bridgestone. Kind of sad skating over the SCP logos. Ice gets melted Saturday.  The hawks left a taste in my mouth similar to that of black licorice. Ready for next year.

With that said. I think Lavy has basically taken the team that Trotzy and Poile had built and ro-tooled them to make them a playoff team. In that respect, I think Lavy has truly embodied ""to have contributed the most to his team's success"". It was the change in play style that he brought that made this year's team great.

I feel like we only have 2 must-have's in that list, Smith and Wilson. I'd feel like we would just about match anyone's offer as long as its under 4-5 million a year. I'd like to see them get about 3 or 3.5 personally."
Predators,352u67,Kidparkinsons,3,Wed May 6 18:03:42 2015 UTC,I kind of hoped that we could get Ribs and Fisher under 4M a year
Predators,352u67,asphinctersayswhat,4,Wed May 6 18:07:38 2015 UTC,"Ribs will be paid as long as he has 1st or 2nd line hotshots to feed from center. Obvs ideally he gets bumped to 2C and we get our 1C, but either way he's got a few great years left. Pay the man.  Fisher I would like to see under 4M cap hit. It makes sense that a player like him that is apparently close to retirement would take a discount to help the team and maybe snag a cup here."
Predators,352u67,1137ismyfavoritetime,2,Wed May 6 19:15:29 2015 UTC,So if ribs goes to 2c and we get a true 1c does that bump fisher to 3c? I feel that we need fish in the ice more than a 3c would permit.
Predators,352u67,asphinctersayswhat,2,Thu May 7 05:19:15 2015 UTC,It's a tough call actually because Ribs is younger and a great feed guy and Lavy is clearly prioritizing Calle's development. Truth be told I hadnt thought it thru.
Predators,352u67,stefan223,3,Thu May 7 08:34:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah that deal would be good. He's still got a lot to offer in terms of his leadership and experience, so he's obviously worth keeping around. Get this deal done and then resign Ribs too please! :)"
Predators,353cwm,MunchieMunich,3,Wed May 6 19:36:25 2015 UTC,I have a Radulov Authentic from 2006-2007 if you or anyone else is interested in a trade.

Predators,35249u,iblamethehiphop,5,Wed May 6 21:15:18 2015 UTC,I watched some. Mostly Rangers games
Predators,35249u,Wyntersun,8,Wed May 6 21:47:46 2015 UTC,Knowing the Wild is down 0-3 against the Hawks makes me wonder if we had advanced the Wild would be gettin clobbered as much or not. Just random wild speculation. And my last final is today!
Predators,35249u,iblamethehiphop,9,Wed May 6 16:06:52 2015 UTC,I heard someone in my office saying that people in the Minnesota media were CONVINCED that the only reason the Preds v Hawks series was so close was because the Hawks were toying with the Predators and that the Hawks were by far the better team.  Good jokes..
Predators,35249u,KakunaUsedHarden,8,Wed May 6 16:44:32 2015 UTC,"So the Wild are toying with the Hawks, and will come back from being down 3-0 to win? That'll be exciting, I can't wait to see!"
Predators,35249u,auquf,5,Wed May 6 18:18:41 2015 UTC,"Dude, wow. Some koolaid they're drinking. Even the Hawks fans I know have agreed the Preds/Hawks series could've gone our way very easily too. It's funny because at the time of talking to them they were afraid of the Wild too. I haven't been following the post season so much since elimination, but is the Wild collapsing? Or did the Hawks find their momentum? Or both?"
Predators,35249u,covinous,7,Wed May 6 20:14:32 2015 UTC,"/u/Gumpyyy retweeted a tweet that pretty much summed up the Wild:  ""For his career until January 1, 2015, Dubnyk had a .909 save percentage. From April 1 to present his save percentage is .909. But he'll always have those two months."""
Predators,35249u,auquf,6,Wed May 6 20:26:57 2015 UTC,Hawks are really making us look good/the Blues look brutal eh
Predators,35249u,MunchieMunich,2,Wed May 6 18:48:32 2015 UTC,"No, bro, the Hawks were just keeping the series against the Preds close so their fans could get a vacation..."
Predators,35249u,auquf,7,Wed May 6 19:38:50 2015 UTC,I'm going to the Grand Prix of Indianapolis on Saturday. Pretty stoked.
Predators,35249u,MunchieMunich,5,Wed May 6 14:33:17 2015 UTC,Bring sunscreen. Got roasted at the Indy 500 a few years ago.

Predators,35249u,auquf,3,Wed May 6 15:46:21 2015 UTC,"I went last year and also to the 500. I'm sitting in the covered tower that's turn one on the oval. I just know I need to get there earlier to hit all the races.  I'm going back for the 500, too. I'm going to head up on Thursday so I can hit the sprint car races and carb day."
Predators,35249u,tuxfile,2,Wed May 6 17:29:25 2015 UTC,sounds like a perfect plan. for the grand prix i prefer to just get general admission tickets and wander throughout the race. for the 500 this year i'll be in between turn 3 and 4.
Predators,35249u,auquf,7,Wed May 6 18:50:24 2015 UTC,"I bought a mini-vending machine for my house.   Best purchase I've made so far.   Also, I played beer league two nights ago here in VaBeach and scored 6 goals between two games -- 2 in the first, and 4 in the 2nd. The league is talking about bumping me to B league but the only thing holding me back is the fact that I skate like a tard. A fast tard, but still a tard."

Predators,35249u,DuxF,3,Wed May 6 18:17:42 2015 UTC,"That's cool, it's nice to see people actually trying to take their car into their own hands. I'm an apprentice and the amount of people who don't know anything about their car is a little bit ridiculous. A women came in a couple days ago with an engine light on, checked it out, gas cap was left open cause a code for engine light. I was like wow really.  Oil, brakes, struts, all fairly easy stuff that people have a lot of problems with."
Predators,35249u,VolsAndPreds,2,Wed May 6 19:01:27 2015 UTC,"At least it was an easy fix..? Oh man, hahaha.   My oil and brakes I can change by myself (not so much the latter anymore, because one of our neighbors stole our jack stands RIGHT OUTTA THE GARAGE), but I don't know if I'd ever attempt suspension work. I'm just so afraid that if I miss one tiny thing or forget to tighten one bolt, my car will fall apart at 80mph on the freeway.  Somewhat related: I almost had a wheel come off while I was driving because the guy at the tire shop didn't tighten ANY of my lug nuts. Scariest noise/sensation I've ever heard from my car."
Predators,35249u,burgerboy5753,3,Wed May 6 19:49:07 2015 UTC,"That's true! It took me a while to build up the confidence to do some jobs, and to be confident the customer is safe after!   To be honest I'm not surprised at all. Most tire/oil change places hire just generally lazy people, and they get easily distracted. While I was in school for a bit, that happened all the time, kid would throw a tire back up tighten it by hand, and then go shoot the breeze with someone or get a call and whatever and walk away. Happened with a customer car one time, guy only put 1 nut on, customer went to drive it out bang bent rim, bearing pulled half out, ball joint done, whole big mess."

Predators,34w8w0,bocksington,8,Tue May 5 01:59:45 2015 UTC,I think it should be an all season long tradition.
Predators,34w8w0,asphalt_incline,2,Tue May 5 12:44:01 2015 UTC,"eh. you don't want to over play it. if you do it all season it'll be stale and played out by the end of the year. It's like the cheering during the final TV time out, just keep it in the pocket until we really need it."
Predators,34w8w0,alexkendig,12,Tue May 5 22:23:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It's a fun and patriotic, and also an answer to visiting fans disrespecting the anthem. Most pipe down or join in, and the remaining fans can't be heard very well anyway."
Predators,34w8w0,Gumpyyy,3,Tue May 5 02:30:47 2015 UTC,"It's also something that gets the crowd into it. I love how Canadians will sing their anthem, because it springboards into the game energy."

Predators,34w8w0,J1FP,6,Wed May 6 13:19:27 2015 UTC,Every other person in Nashville is a musician trying to be discovered anyway. Sing the anthem yourselves! I love the live music between periods.
Predators,34w8w0,feuerkugel,2,Tue May 5 12:59:47 2015 UTC,I think we should sing both anthems when Canadian teams come to town. I hope they put the lyrics to O' Canada up at least.
Predators,34w8w0,DuxF,1 point,Tue May 5 18:21:46 2015 UTC,I'm anti. Let's have a Predators anthem instead.
Predators,34w8w0,molby9,1 point,Tue May 5 15:44:29 2015 UTC,"I am not a fan. I think it is cheesy and stupid. With how they kept the majority of Blackhawks fans out during the playoffs, I didn't think it was even needed to prevent them from ruining it. Just my opinion though. I don't foresee it stopping."
Predators,34w8w0,jackattack615,3,Tue May 5 11:38:36 2015 UTC,"Seems a bit cheesy and forced to me too, but perhaps it will get better with time? I think it would work better to have someone actually singing it over the PA, and encouraging everyone to sing along with them. And to me, it makes way more sense to do it at REGULAR season games vs. Blackhawks, because those are the games that Chicago fans actually show up for.  If I had my way, I would say just let Dennis Morgan do it every time. That guy absolutely crushes it without fail -- maybe bring in that opera group, or bluegrass ensemble, or a famous singer to sing it once in a while.   But I'm definitely sick of the American Idol blooper reel of ""talent"" who drags it out to 3 minutes without hitting half of the basic notes properly"
Predators,34w8w0,oatmealfoot,2,Tue May 5 14:54:20 2015 UTC,Stretching the national anthem is light treason.
Predators,34w8w0,notheebie,2,Tue May 5 16:02:01 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Love Dennis Morgan, but man when they bring in a real talented group... the anthem never sounds so beautiful when it's sung by 4 or 5 country voices in harmony.  Having the arena sing it really loses the beauty and gravitas of the lyrics. The anthem isn't meant for bringing some buzzed elation to the building. Not to mention it just reeks of ""let's start a tradition!"""
Predators,34w8w0,yupyupyuppp,2,Wed May 6 18:49:52 2015 UTC,"The way I see it most traditions are by definition contrived (everything started somewhere, yeah?).  And this one is frankly as good as any.  I say let it develop.  It's nice to do something unique.  So what if it stemmed from protest to hawks fans?  I think that adds legitimacy to it.  It has a story behind it."
Predators,34w8w0,Bocheetus,-7,Tue May 5 22:28:37 2015 UTC,I like this a lot as a tradition. Anthem singing >>>>>> post-goal chanting One is respectful and classy the other is juvenile and dumb.

Predators,34rmwn,Kidparkinsons,12,Sun May 3 23:38:57 2015 UTC,"People always talk about how Josi/Ekholm are the most underated players on this team. In my opinion, Jones is the most underated by far. The way he moves/carries the puck into the offensive zone is awesome. He's one of the best players on the team right now, although he doesn't get credit for it. Don't touch him :("
Predators,34rmwn,hic2482w1,2,Mon May 4 00:55:24 2015 UTC,"the only reason why I choose him is that he might not reach his highest potential when he will be playing behind Josi and Weber. believe me, I don't want to lose him either."
Predators,34rmwn,IamSasquatch,5,Mon May 4 00:59:45 2015 UTC,I think playing behind them actually helps him develop to full potential. Who better to learn from than two of the best D-men in the league. And it's not like he's playing third-pairing minutes going forward.

Predators,34rmwn,AmericanSatellite9,6,Mon May 4 17:11:21 2015 UTC,"Call me crazy, but I would almost rather trade Weber than Jones.  I'm a big believer in Jones. The kid can flat out skate, and that sets players apart. You can learn defending techniques and the mental stuff, but not many players have the raw skating ability that Jones has. Plus we've got him for super cheap right now, and playing 2nd/3rd pairing I don't think anyone else is going to give him a huge offer sheet that we won't want to match when he becomes an RFA.  Weber on the other hand would command a huge return if we traded him. We could bring back much more than Nuge, and in addition we would free up a ton of cap space to go after the UFAs we needed to fill our gaps.  I'm not necessarily saying that I want to trade Weber, but I am saying that I definitely don't want to trade Jones."

Weber's injury leaves a huge question mark on the D corps, Franson's gone, Volchenkov is a question mark.   Trading Jones leaves the cupboard rather empty, and Josi can't play 40+ every game."
Predators,34rmwn,BrianWilsonsBed,3,Mon May 4 00:26:15 2015 UTC,"Edmonton doesn't do it. Let me start by saying I would love to see Seth Jones in Edmonton but I think it would have to be more of a Draisaitl plus for Jones trade because the Oilers can't afford to move Nuge.  The Oilers centre depth chart is currently: Nugent-Hopkins, McDavid(presumed), Lander, Gordon with a possibility of Roy re-signing and battling for third line minutes.   Roy was a nice acquisition and played way better than I expected but his effect on Nail Yakupov has been greatly overstated. Nail had already been playing well but didn't have very good offensive line mates particularly a centremen and his offensive abilities weren't showing up on the score sheet. Nail's game is in no way dependent on Derek Roy as some people seem to believe and Roy doesn't make Nugent-Hopkins expendable in any way.   Nuge is basically the entire teams best 200 foot hockey player and it's going to be very important for him to be the first line centre in order to allow McDavid to play on the 2nd unit and establish himself in the NHL without having to be the guy.   TL:DR would absolutely love for Seth Jones to be an Oiler, Nuge isin't in any way expendable as fans from other teams seem to have started to believe."

Predators,34e7vi,flirt77,1 point,Thu Apr 30 12:50:31 2015 UTC,Stalberg's hits/TOI ratio was the most surprising stat for me. I mean he was clearly playing a physical game but I didn't realize how much he was throwing his body around.
Predators,34e7vi,oatmealfoot,2,Thu Apr 30 14:52:28 2015 UTC,"Was very surprised to see that Stalberg had so many hits. He was really giving it out there, more than I've ever seen from him."
Predators,34e7vi,BlueMonk0,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:12:43 2015 UTC,"Stalberg's a tough cookie -- and also tough to pin down  Dude is so damn fast, easily one of the quickest on our team -- and he puts in a hell of a lot of effort. The problem is always -- once he gets down the ice with the puck, he's got an open lane ... he always flubs!  If he can just tighten his puck handling and his focus, he will be one of our best resources on offense"
Predators,34e0rl,dougie1107,4,Thu Apr 30 11:37:29 2015 UTC,"I don't really know about this kid, why are they terminating his contract?"
Predators,34e0rl,jackattack615,3,Thu Apr 30 11:48:32 2015 UTC,He wants to come play in NA. He tried to last year but they wouldn't terminate his contract then (otherwise he would've played for the Remparts). It sounded like originally he was going to come over just for the camp this year and if he made the team they'd terminate his contract but now I guess they decided to terminate it anyways.
Predators,34e0rl,KakunaUsedHarden,4,Thu Apr 30 14:32:40 2015 UTC,I think you're right in saying he can't play in Milwaukee next year. He'll do a stint in the CHL ... it will be good for him.
Predators,34e0rl,tuxfile,5,Thu Apr 30 18:03:40 2015 UTC,I might actually suck it up and pay shipping for Remparts gear if he does.
Predators,34e0rl,KakunaUsedHarden,5,Thu Apr 30 18:12:25 2015 UTC,If you actually want something I could buy it for you and send it ... probably cheaper...I go to Quebec City twice a year in the winter.
Predators,34e0rl,tuxfile,2,Thu Apr 30 18:19:11 2015 UTC,I want a tshirt or a hoodie or something. I can't remember how much shipping is but it's absurd. I'll check it and see if it'd be any cheaper to get you to pick something up.

Also, This flurry of saves by Rinne vs Anaheim.

Predators,34anz7,DrWillyTrill,5,Wed Apr 29 18:40:07 2015 UTC,It still showed how terrible things were there
Predators,34anz7,Sniper_tf2,5,Wed Apr 29 18:45:35 2015 UTC,Absolutely it was a terrible situation just that run gave them 20 unwanted points for a higher lottery pick.  I love to listen to their Leafs Lunch radio show...they were laughing at the fact their defacto number 1 defenseman was getting scratched here because our defense was so deep.
Predators,34anz7,c3ndre,2,Wed Apr 29 18:53:37 2015 UTC,Were they actually giving us that credit or freaking out that their bb wasn't getting the minutes he deserved? Because I only saw the latter.
Predators,34anz7,c3ndre,2,Wed Apr 29 23:05:35 2015 UTC,"Credit, a lot of Canadian stuff I've listened to love Nashville.  The discussion on their part started out talking about off season signings they would make and if they could re-target Franson and Santorelli.  And they were making a reference that Franson might become cheaper after his performance here and the fact that he might not be as high on boards as people might think by the fact he was getting healthy scratched by our depth.  I don't necessarily agree his price will go down because its unfair to compare our depth with the desperateness that is caused by having a proven defenseman and peoples over willingness to pay for that."
Predators,34anz7,IamSasquatch,3,Thu Apr 30 00:04:18 2015 UTC,Game against Washington in January. Barry Trotz return night and a late winner by Neal. Awesome game.

Predators,346wc4,Oddsock1701,5,Tue Apr 28 20:40:40 2015 UTC,Hi! It's great to know that there are other UK fans of the Preds on here.  Yeah so many of my friends are like 'why are you watching that?'. But each to their own I suppose. I did manage to get my flatmate into Hockey though and he's now absolutely crazy about it! :)
Predators,346wc4,Oddsock1701,5,Tue Apr 28 20:44:31 2015 UTC,"It's got something unique about it, the atmosphere in The NHL a has something that we don't seem to get over here. I have a friend at University so he does like Hockey as well :) But I would like to see The NHL grow over here, it would be good to have more places to watch games etc.)"
Predators,346wc4,molby9,4,Tue Apr 28 20:47:00 2015 UTC,Yeah it's different to most sports which I think is why I enjoy it so much. I would love to see the NHL grow over here. Hopefully the Elite League will grow a bit too to increase the sport's popularity over here.

Predators,347vct,Gumpyyy,6,Wed Apr 29 00:21:15 2015 UTC,I think it makes more sense to say I'm only rooting for the Wild in their upcoming series against the Hawks.   Whoever faces them in the WC final can beat 7 shades of shit out of them for all I care.
Predators,347vct,Gumpyyy,15,Wed Apr 29 00:28:40 2015 UTC,The Hawks fanbase is already peaked in terms of size and level of pompous terribleness. Do we want the Wild to reach that level? No sir. I want them to die.

Predators,347vct,covinous,7,Wed Apr 29 01:46:48 2015 UTC,"Caps for Trotz and Ovi. Also, I won't be actively rooting for them, but I wouldn't mind if the Blackhawks win. What's it say for the Preds if the Hawks win? That they crushed the Stanley cup champs in two games and very nearly beat them in two more. Plus the Hawks have been doing some PR friendly off-ice stuff that I like with charities and kids."
Predators,347vct,emokiller24,3,Wed Apr 29 01:35:43 2015 UTC,I've got basically the same stance as you.

Predators,347vct,lithicstudio,5,Wed Apr 29 03:38:43 2015 UTC,"Grew up watching the Bolts so Tampa's my #2, but also rooting for the Caps for Trotz. I haven't figured out the lesser of any evils in the West so... screw them."
Predators,347vct,Merrai,3,Wed Apr 29 03:37:13 2015 UTC,"Same here. Born and raised in Tampa, so absolutely pulling for the Bolts. And you've gotta cheer on the Caps for Trotz!"
Predators,347vct,AllOfYourYes,14,Wed Apr 29 05:55:10 2015 UTC,I'm rooting for the Blackhawks being eliminated and the Caps for Trotz.
Predators,347vct,HeatherFeather11,5,Wed Apr 29 00:32:05 2015 UTC,Caps for sure.  They were my next pick

The bullshit ACL reports were because people on the internet were talking too. Your source may be legit, but we have no way to validate that so it amounts to rumor and speculation."
Predators,342nlz,Bout5beers,4,Mon Apr 27 22:12:19 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying, tough to say I told you so when you don't even mention that you had any source.

Predators,342nlz,ksturgis,-1,Mon Apr 27 22:12:12 2015 UTC,"Oh right, because no story has ever been run with ""Unnamed Source"" as the source.

Hes not a journalist risking his career on an unnamed source, hes the same as the rest of us. Some shlub on a website. Plenty of users said they had connections that said it was an Achilles injury. Which was false.  Even NBC incorrectly said it was an Achilles due to piss-pour sources. So lets wait for a real source instead of wildly speculating."
Predators,342nlz,Bout5beers,-2,Mon Apr 27 22:28:03 2015 UTC,"Fine. But I'll keep putting out what I hear from my source and saying I fuckin atoadaso every time until I get a little credit.

This would hurt if he weren't doing things like being invited to represent his (hockey-crazy, talent-filled) country in World Tournaments, being nominated for the Vezina, being named to play in the All-Star Game (not by a mob of bandwagon fans, either)..  Edit: of course I am worried he's not doing as well as he should be (my rose-colored/homer goggles aren't that thick), but I'm going to wait to see how he does next season before freaking out :D"

Predators,341b7f,IamSasquatch,12,Mon Apr 27 15:01:11 2015 UTC,"The Tennesseean is an absolute fucking joke.  Those dumbass flyers they handed out with the rules at game 1, the shockingly incompetent and unnecessary ""Eat Our Biscuits"" article, and now this piece of dogshit only mentioning in passing that game 1 was lost in double OT while completely skipping over that game 4 was lost in triple OT. Not to mention the idiocy of comparing a 7-game series in hockey to a single post-season loss by a football team 7 years ago.    Consider it an opportunity lost. Although Bridgestone Arena was filled to 98 percent capacity during the regular season and all three home playoff games were sold out, it is no secret that this franchise still has plenty of work to do to win over the casual fan in the community.   You know what else helps win  over casual fans? When the community supports the team instead of writing bullshit articles comparing a young, talented core in a growing franchise who actually gives a shit about its fans to the train-wreck money-grab that is the Titans.  Fuck you David Climer."

I also don't remember the Tennesseean talking very much about the Predators until recently. Only when this sub brings it up.  Edit: Grammar. And I don't read the Tennesseean unless it's brought up on Reddit. So I aplogize in advance in case I play captain obvious."

Predators,341b7f,white_hart_lane,8,Tue Apr 28 14:08:16 2015 UTC,"The column was pretty harsh and compared us to the Titans...   It's always dangerous to cross-reference sports, but this strikes me as the NHL equivalent to what happened to the Titans in 2008. Despite a rather pedestrian roster that included Kerry Collins at quarterback, the '08 Titans went 13-3 in the regular season and received a first-round bye in the playoffs.  Then they made an abrupt exit from the postseason with a 13-10 disappearing act against Baltimore.  For those keeping score, that was the Titans' last playoff appearance.   Sure, we could have had a better outcome in the first round, but we played our (injury-affected) asses off and have no reason to hang our heads going forward.  For comparison's sake, this is a much more reasonable analysis of why we are out of the playoffs right now."

Before Wilson could answer, Climer walks up, shoves me out of the way and starts asking his own questions. I walked out because honestly, I didn't know if that was just how it was. It wasn't. He never produced a story out of it and didn't show up at a game again until the playoffs."

To his credit, I usually enjoy his analysis of the Titans, because the criticism and degrading is deserved for that stagnant franchise. But a Game 6 Round 1 loss? A little soon Climer. Fuck off."
Predators,341tz2,the_penis_mightyer,7,Mon Apr 27 17:19:07 2015 UTC,"For starters, we traded our first round draft pick to Toronto for Franson and Santorelli, so we're not drafting very high this year. I know this draft is supposed to be deep, but I'm not sure how much. There are few in this sub that are much better at keeping up with draftees, etc, than I am.  Our system is full of players that are going to at least get looks for the team next year. Fiala isn't a year or so away. He's ready now. It's hard to say so after two games here, but he's ready. Other players that will get looks: Arvidsson, Kamanev, Sissons, Watson, Salomaki, and Moses.  Biggest holes? I'd say we need two things badly: a top line center and a 3rd line scorer. Santorelli was supposed to be the latter, but it didn't really pan out. The free agent window is still a little hazy as teams aren't doing many deals yet. For the Preds, you want to lock up Wilson, Smith, Fisher, and Ribeiro before really going out and picking up a lot of players.  There's going to be a lot of speculation about who the Preds need and are approaching over the next few months. Take it all with a grain of salt."
Predators,341tz2,motherfuckintrex,7,Mon Apr 27 17:29:06 2015 UTC,"You left out an NHL quality backup goalie.  While I LOVE Hutton with a huge man crush, reality is that we cannot rely on him for more than a handful of games.  He could not have done what Darling did.  Edit.  I am also concerned about our faceoff.  Only having Goose and Fish hurts us, we just done win enough faceoffs and it really cost us vs Chicago."

Predators,341tz2,Oddsock1701,6,Mon Apr 27 18:48:22 2015 UTC,"He's a really easy guy to like. I think if Hutton were given the time, he'd develop his skill a bit more and become pretty solid. He's had some incredible (and I mean absolutely amazing) highlight reel saves. But Pekka gets the majority of the workload so Hutton is pretty much ice cold when he is given the opportunity. Even with a better than average goaltender, I feel like they're not going to perform the way they should unless they've been given the opportunity to find their groove. It's not the best example but it sort of works: I've noticed that when starters miss a few weeks and return, their first game back is a complete bust.  My two cent opinion is Hutton is going to be let go this summer and Poile will look to Mazanec or Hellberg to take the #2 spot pending how they perform this preseason."
Predators,341tz2,omjf23,5,Mon Apr 27 19:28:11 2015 UTC,I will be sad if Hutton goes :(
Predators,341tz2,Oddsock1701,4,Mon Apr 27 19:31:11 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry :(.  Like I truly am. It never gets easier to watch your fav players leave. My wife was upset when we traded Hornqvist and I was sad to watch Legwand be traded (though I acknowledge that it was time).  There is a chance that he will return next season, but sooner or later Poile is going to want to bring in one of the Milwaukee goalies. I'm pretty sure having them both there is why we let Scott Darling walk last summer."
Predators,341tz2,omjf23,3,Mon Apr 27 19:35:39 2015 UTC,"This would be a sad thing to happen, but I can understand why they would trade him. He is a under rated player in my opinion.  Do you think the Milwaukee Goalies will be better long term prospects?  My favourite player is Shea Weber and I think we can all agree he will be with us his entire career (He would be worthy of retiring a number for when he does retire :D)  Either way, I would miss Hutton a lot, I absolutely love his interviews during the games as well :D"
Predators,341tz2,Oddsock1701,3,Mon Apr 27 19:57:15 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say really.   Mazanec has played in Nashville for stretches in the past so he's got more experience than Hellberg. I would really like to see Hellberg improve a bit. They both played almost equally well last season in Milwaukee with Maz having slightly better stats. Given their youth though, they could very well be better long-term prospects.  Right now Hutton is sort of a stop gap, a player to fill the backup role until someone else comes along. It may not even be Mazanec or Hellberg, but sometime down the road you'll want the backup to be someone who is perfectly capable of starting a few games and will one day take the reigns when Pekka isn't #1 anymore. Obviously we are a ways away from that point, but even Pekka was once Vokoun's backup."
Predators,341tz2,omjf23,2,Mon Apr 27 20:11:53 2015 UTC,"That makes sense! It's just a shame, I wish we used him more, then maybe he would be a lot better and would have been someone who we would have continued to use and improve :D !"

Predators,341tz2,OCCUPY_BallsDeep,7,Mon Apr 27 17:28:58 2015 UTC,The trade I'd like to make is Franson and Santorelli for a first.
Predators,341tz2,snipespb,3,Mon Apr 27 20:59:50 2015 UTC,"The team needs a 1c and/or a deep 3rd line which was exploited in the playoff series.    The two solutions to that are a trade or free agency.  The free agency is less likely IMO since it looks a bit weaker for what we need.  If you look at a trade you could target a player like Ryan Nugent-Hopkins.  You add an extremely talented center that could boost your first lines potency...he is going to cost a lot though.  They potentially are interested in this trade due to the McDavid draft pick and need defense...we have defense potentially going to cost Ellis and a pick or prospect...they might aim for a higher defensive player but I don't see us parting with Weber or Josi and I believe Jones potential peak is higher than Ellis.  That still leaves you Weber/Josi and Jones/Ekholm which i believe is still a potently stout 1-2 defensive corps.    If a trade like this doesn't happen you have to look within your organization. You have 3 expiring center contracts... Cullen, Fisher, and Ribero.  I'd argue the best scenario is to get a true 1c and keep Fisher and hope for another 1mil steal on Ribero but I don't see that happening again.  You have to remember all 3 are aging and I don't trust the ole ""lighting striking twice"" in Ribero.  If I don't get my 1c you have to keep Fisher and Ribero, if you get your 1c you have to let Ribero go. because you have Jarnkrok still on RFA and I feel like they like him.    If you get your way how great would something like this which gives you potentially powerful top 2 lines, assuming Moses isn't a bust and the KHL wasn't a fluke and leaves some depth with potential young talent on the third line and the very tough 4th line in place...my only concern is the third line still being a little too inexperienced but if we get it built from the beginning maybe they can learn and develop properly or if you get Ribero you have that leadership or you can move around the leadership to help that out.  Neal - Nugent-Hopkins - Forsberg  Wilson - Fisher - Moses  Fiala/Arvidsson - Jarnkrok (Ribero?) - Smith  Borque - Gaustad - Nystrom (Beck)  Josi - Weber  Ekholm - Jones  Bartley - Bitteto (Potential vet signing)"

Predators,341tz2,snipespb,2,Mon Apr 27 19:15:06 2015 UTC,"Could be right, part of my weakness in making a roster/line up like this is I partially guessed sides and used an article that said he was a right handed shot and assumed right wing...which by translation could leave the wings on the third line wrong too but I think it was more the idea than anything and with Lavi...he puts anyone anywhere at anytime anyway."
Predators,341tz2,dougie1107,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:42:43 2015 UTC,I would rather trade Jones and keep Ellis who's already a great option for a #3 defenseman. We'll get a higher return for Jones.

Predators,341tz2,snipespb,2,Mon Apr 27 20:33:24 2015 UTC,"Can certainly agree with that, who do you target though?  Need to combine what you get with what it costs...You looking at Richards?  I mean I just don't see any of that 1c level player available which is why I presented the idea of Nugent-Hopkins...I think the oil would be better served having him and McDavid as a 1-2 punch and figuring out defense from there but they are certainly ready to move pieces for a D or goalie."
Predators,341tz2,pwnicholson,0,Mon Apr 27 21:36:54 2015 UTC,"In a perfect world, you use this as your shopping list. Obviously you weigh the players all around contribution, age, and a lot of other factors, but there are worse places to start the hunt (like players draft ranking, hype, or regular season points per game)  Career playoff points Leaders among active centers - http://www.nhl.com/stats/career?gameType=3&team=&position=C&country=&active=true&viewName=careerLeadersAllSeasons  Names that seem like they could potentially be plausible to have a conversation about: Richards, Bolland, Krejci, Backstrom, Giroux, Filppula, Stepan, Brassard, Dubinsky, Toffoli, Jordan Staal, ...  I don't know. I'm just spit ballin'. Point is, performance when it matters needs to be prioritized over flash. That experience is what I loved about bringing in Neal, and back when he came on, Cullen.  Interestingly, Cullen and Fisher are both in the top 30 on that list (due mostly to age and one long playoff run for each of them during their primes)"

This attitude remains baffling to me. Yeah we have some great, tense rivalries with St Louis and Minnesota, and when they come to town the gameday environment reaches a fever pitch. But I like both of those rivalries. And neither of those matchups can hold a candle to how much I hate it when Blackhawks fans descend upon our arena. They're rude as hell (not in a fun way); the anthem tradition they cling to is idiotic and lame; and half of those fans couldn't tell you a single player on the team outside of Kane and Toews.  I've been a football and baseball fan for just as long as I've been a hockey fan (if not longer) but I've never hated any team (and moreso, their fanbase) more than I hate the Blackhawks.  I don't care if it ""makes us look better"" if they continue to win after beating us. The only scenario I could understand justifying rooting for them would be to see them fall extra hard by losing in the Stanley Cup Series.  But that would give their lousy fans just another point to blather about, that they were the ""runner-up"" in the league.

We just cant afford any more than that if we're going to try for a center. I would be ok with trading one of them (Wilson, I like him but I feel like Smith is the better player and we need the RW player more) and paying the other what it takes  Even if we cant get a C, Ribeiro isnt going to take another 1 mil to play."
Predators,33zcln,IamSasquatch,2,Mon Apr 27 03:18:15 2015 UTC,"I just don't understand that. Maybe you're right. But if he's so great, why was he hanging out at 25, unsigned and playing in Europe? I would think it's not a foregone conclusion for him to even make the roster."
Predators,33zcln,yupyupyuppp,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:11:59 2015 UTC,"Why was Ribeiro paid to leave Arizona? Those were different circumstances, but I'm not doubting Poile. At $1 million for one year, he is definitely worth the risk.   Obviously he will have to fight for a spot. But after setting the KHL scoring record, he will be full of confidence and I'm confident that he will make it.  Edit: I don't know what I was thinking this morning. I'm overly optimistic for Moses. Sorry guys. I stand by my statement about Poile though. He's the man."
Predators,33zcln,IamSasquatch,2,Mon Apr 27 14:55:29 2015 UTC,"a reclamation project on Ribeiro, a 34 year old proven pro and former NHL All-Star... compared to a guy that has never played pro in North America (he laced up as an amateur try-out for 8 games for an AHL team).   These two are as unrelated as they can be.  I get that Moses lead the KHL in goals and was 3rd in G per game this last year. But a dose of reality, he also finished with only 5 more points than Dustin Boyd. A few years ago he was 7th in G's in SM Liiga (in 12-13) behind a guy named Ramzi Abid at #6.  Again, he might make the roster, but the hype train just sounds WAY out of proportion for signing a guy that is ranking in lesser leagues along side former NHL has-beens and never-weres.  Nice to have him in the system and I'd love to be pleasantly surprised. But to me this is, at best, equivalent to signing a 2nd or 3rd round pick on the hope/hype scale."
Predators,33zcln,Gumpyyy,2,Mon Apr 27 16:57:03 2015 UTC,"You're right. I do get overly optimistic about prospects sometimes. In my mind I was only comparing him with Kovalchuk, who was 25-30-55 this season. It is apples and oranges at the end of the day, so we'll see."
Predators,33zcln,IamSasquatch,2,Mon Apr 27 18:52:49 2015 UTC,"You're ""confident""? Seriously? He's never played pro hockey in his life. Leading scoring with NHL rejects means practically nothing if you haven't played NA ice."
Predators,33zcln,Gumpyyy,2,Mon Apr 27 18:44:57 2015 UTC,I'm pumping the brakes on my hype train a bit. We shall see how he does.
Predators,33zcln,IamSasquatch,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:53:55 2015 UTC,Rumor is he turned down bigger contracts to be with us.
Predators,33zcln,AmericanSatellite9,1 point,Mon Apr 27 15:22:51 2015 UTC,That warms my soul. It seems that we've finally turned the corner and are a desirable FA destination. That will make a huge difference in the coming seasons.  I would also like to see us invest more in the salary. We may have to resume operating at a deficit to get to the cup finals. A long-term investment could pay off with bigger revenues down the road. Look at Chicago--they spent roughly 50% more on salary than we did this year.
Predators,33zcln,Gumpyyy,2,Mon Apr 27 15:29:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Chicago's salary cap situation is a disaster."
Predators,33zcln,AmericanSatellite9,1 point,Mon Apr 27 15:35:07 2015 UTC,"That's true. I guess I would like to see us spend some more money to upgrade this offseason. Only Arizona has more available cap space than we do right now, with Buffalo and Toronto right behind us."
Predators,33x5z4,Wardog1368,15,Sun Apr 26 14:17:06 2015 UTC,"It takes guts to go into the UC as a fan of the away team, especially with such a heated rivalry, and especially during the playoffs. Much respect to you for proudly representing Perds fans!"

Predators,33x5z4,SunAds5274,4,Mon Apr 27 12:14:26 2015 UTC,That's awesome guys! Let's go Preds!
Predators,33z3ix,TheNumber35,14,Mon Apr 27 00:11:23 2015 UTC,"Take that shit right away, no question."
Predators,33z3ix,hic2482w1,6,Mon Apr 27 00:26:46 2015 UTC,"I love Weber as much as the next guy but McJesus is a generational talent.   If this question was for the #2 pick, I would have to think about it. For the #1 pick? Yes, trade, next question please."
Predators,33z3ix,Deep__Thought,8,Mon Apr 27 01:38:34 2015 UTC,"Obviously McDavid is an amazing player and will make an immediate impact in the league, but he certainly won't replace how much Weber means to this team. We've got one of the best defenses in the league but you have to wonder how they'd do without Weber leading them..."
Predators,33z3ix,bicuspidpayload,0,Mon Apr 27 00:43:19 2015 UTC,"I think we just saw three games of it and the answer was ""not bad, but not great"". Josi would lead and Jones continue to mature.   Here's the dark truth: it will be amazingly hard to keep Weber, Josi, and Jones very long. Yes Josi and Weber are on long deals at a relative bargain and Jones is looking at many years as an RFA after his ELC, but I think the offers we'll get for them will be too good to pass up."
Predators,33z3ix,pwnicholson,6,Mon Apr 27 03:09:06 2015 UTC,"This is a tough question: One the on hand, we have a very good d-corps that is very young so it's not like we would lose all of our defensive prowess for an amazing talent in McDavid or Eichel  On the other hand: The D-corps is very young and losing the old man (hehe) in Weber would be huge because I'm sure he plays a big part in growing the younger crop. Also, not having Weber really hurt us in the end of the series. You can't replace a talent that is in the Norris conversation at the end of every season.  My conclusion: Don't trade. Even if it is for McEichel"
Predators,33z3ix,AmericanSatellite9,7,Mon Apr 27 00:50:03 2015 UTC,"Take that deal. Weber is the best d-man in the league, but this kid is a prodigy. Plus, he's also much more marketable than Shea Weber, and that is saying something. Edmonton wouldn't do this deal. McDavid is another Gretzky."
Predators,33z3ix,jdsummerlin12,3,Mon Apr 27 01:38:26 2015 UTC,"I'm 95% sure you're right that they wouldn't want to do it. The 5% reservation I have is because a. Edmonton NEEDS defense and b. Chiarelli had the stout D man when he won with Boston in Chara, so it's possible he wants to build around that."
Predators,33z3ix,jdsummerlin12,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:02:58 2015 UTC,"I'll buy that. I wasn't saying its a bad deal, because personally I think it's a brilliant trade for both sides. I'd like to know an Edmonton fan's view of it."
Predators,33z3ix,IamSasquatch,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:41:29 2015 UTC,"They should trade Hall, Eberle or RNH for D. While Edmonton did trade Gretzky, I don't think they would trade McDavid before he even plays for them."
Predators,33z3ix,auquf,3,Mon Apr 27 09:11:46 2015 UTC,"It will never happen, but for McDavid, do it and do it now.  My own personal opinion is that he's quite possibly the best prospect so far in the 21st Century."
Predators,33z3ix,codeyh,2,Mon Apr 27 03:19:25 2015 UTC,"I seriously doubt anyone wants Weber's contract right now. The offers will get ridiculous come July 1, 2018, assuming he's healthy and still playing at prime."
Predators,33z3ix,klopfuh,2,Mon Apr 27 14:13:23 2015 UTC,Nope.
Predators,33z3ix,somegaijin42,2,Mon Apr 27 03:35:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Everyone already in the thread seems all prepped to dump our captain and a potential franchise player for a (let's be serious here) unproven prospect who might wash up right out of the gate. It wouldn't be the first time in history a sports prospect didn't pan out. The converse is true too...look at Pekka...two-hundred-something'th draft pick...on his day and healthy, unbeatable."
Predators,33z3ix,taelor,1 point,Mon Apr 27 15:57:24 2015 UTC,"my friends and I talked about this the other day. we pretty much all decided that we would easily make that trade, but that it would absolutely never happen."
Predators,33yolo,Legion991,7,Sun Apr 26 22:03:58 2015 UTC,Let Franson walk.
Predators,33yolo,Gumpyyy,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:07:26 2015 UTC,And take Santo with him.

Predators,33x90e,Oddsock1701,11,Sun Apr 26 14:49:15 2015 UTC,Rinne. He's a beast. No question.
Predators,33x90e,ProfaneTank,5,Sun Apr 26 15:48:43 2015 UTC,I'm getting a Forsberg for my first jersey. Or maybe Rinne. Or Weber. Or all 3.
Predators,33x90e,CaptNemo131,1 point,Sun Apr 26 15:54:43 2015 UTC,"Im leaning towards Forsberg or Josi more, Hutton is one I would also like to get eventually :)"
Predators,33x90e,artifex85,2,Sun Apr 26 17:13:41 2015 UTC,"As a heads up, Hutton is only signed through the end of next season and will probably not be re signed as there are goalies chomping at the bit down in Milwaukee."
Predators,33x90e,zellthemedic,4,Sun Apr 26 22:22:12 2015 UTC,"Josi, Forsberg, Rinne. In that order."
Predators,33x90e,c3ndre,3,Sun Apr 26 16:05:59 2015 UTC,"My first choice would be Rinne, but since that's not in your list... probably Josi."
Predators,33x90e,TheKevinShow,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:17:22 2015 UTC,"My list was just possibilities, Rinne is also a good option, As I already Have Weber it would also make sense to have the best goalie after having got the Best Defence Man :D"
Predators,33x90e,AmericanSatellite9,3,Sun Apr 26 18:27:12 2015 UTC,"You have to get Rinne. He is, without question, the best player the Preds have got right now."
Predators,33x90e,tuxfile,2,Sun Apr 26 20:35:24 2015 UTC,"I think Rinne seems to be the best option (Although I Think Shea Weber Is Our best player at the moment, but that might just be my personal bias) But Rinne I think is extremely close"
Predators,33x90e,tuxfile,2,Sun Apr 26 20:55:49 2015 UTC,I still need to get a Predators flag.
Predators,33x90e,lithicstudio,2,Sun Apr 26 17:07:39 2015 UTC,"Not Hutton. I have a blank that I'm debating getting customized, but you can't go wrong with Josi or Forsberg."
Predators,33x90e,omjf23,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:08:12 2015 UTC,"Hutton I like a lot, but Im thinking maybe Josi or Forsberg, as they are excellent players in the team :)"
Predators,33x90e,oskie6,3,Sun Apr 26 17:12:12 2015 UTC,"There's just a huge probability he won't even be here next season, and definitely not after next season."
Predators,33x90e,DuxF,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:30:54 2015 UTC,Would you suggest I wait till next season starts to see who is on our roster?
Predators,33x90e,Legion991,2,Sun Apr 26 17:32:01 2015 UTC,"I love Hutton, but I get the feeling he's a bit more of a stop gap while Maz and Hellboy mature a little more in the AHL. I don't think he'll be here once one of them is ready to make the jump, unless he gets really hot.   That said, it's your jersey! Get Hutton if you want :)"
Predators,33x90e,mtndewhero,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:50:26 2015 UTC,"I just want one with a player that will be with us a long time (Such As My Shea Weber Jersey) :) I like Hutton a lot, but I just don't know how long he will be with us for :("
Predators,33x90e,FurtiveAgentX9,2,Sun Apr 26 19:25:59 2015 UTC,"I would, yes. Several players will be free agents this summer and I'm not sure who all will stay.   Several guys will be in Nashville for years though: Weber, Josi, Rinne, Ellis, Neal, and a few others. I don't see Forsberg going anywhere anytime soon."
Predators,33x90e,befree1231,2,Mon Apr 27 13:06:05 2015 UTC,"While on the topic, is there any type of hybrid jersey I could get to commemorate the Great Josi/Weber line? If only Josi had a 1 digit number this would be easier."
Predators,33vudu,Gumpyyy,38,Sun Apr 26 03:00:12 2015 UTC,I guess that's what happens when you sit on your asses in your own zone for two full periods.

At the beginning of this season I don't think very many of us thought we'd make it this far. We gave them hell and they had to fight to advance. We played damn well without one of our MVP's against a tough ass team. Lavi had an amazing first year with the Preds. We'll be back. And in greater numbers!"
Predators,33vudu,iblamethehiphop,9,Sun Apr 26 03:05:33 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I have no doubt we'll be witnessing some greatness here over the next few years."
Predators,33vudu,AllOfYourYes,9,Sun Apr 26 03:18:09 2015 UTC,"Yup! I'm incredibly proud of our boys not only for how well they did (most of) the season, but for how hard they fought the Hawks when most people thought it would be an easy win for Chicago."

Predators,33vudu,dougie1107,16,Sun Apr 26 03:05:22 2015 UTC,Toronto and Nashville fan here. This one hurts. I just want to know what it feels like to win.
Predators,33vudu,TheScruffington,9,Sun Apr 26 03:20:33 2015 UTC,i know that feel.
Predators,33vudu,lobsterwithcrabs,4,Sun Apr 26 03:33:16 2015 UTC,Right where it hurts...

Predators,33vudu,snophone,6,Sun Apr 26 04:09:57 2015 UTC,I'll be a Nashville fan visiting Toronto next week. So there will be two there for a day.  EDIT: And I will be visiting the HHOF proudly decked out in my Preds gear.
Predators,33vudu,predpilot85,4,Sun Apr 26 04:02:49 2015 UTC,HHOF is great. Remember to not touch the cup! theres lots of other great stuff around there too so have fun. Just make sure if you're around the Skydome (rogers centre) during or after a jays game you will be stuck in traffic for 30 min moving no where.
Predators,33vudu,snophone,5,Sun Apr 26 04:12:26 2015 UTC,I'll be walking from the hotel. The folks in the Toronto sub said it's a completely safe walk so I should be good. :)
Predators,33vudu,predpilot85,4,Sun Apr 26 04:13:29 2015 UTC,yea you'll be ok. Just use common sense and you're good.
Predators,33vudu,snophone,6,Sun Apr 26 04:32:35 2015 UTC,"Naw, there were several in the GDT. Affinity for us for picking up Santa and Franson."
Predators,33vudu,lithicstudio,4,Sun Apr 26 03:33:51 2015 UTC,I'm a fan of both teams :D I've always lived in Nashville and been a Preds fan and Toronto has been my secondary team. I only have it as my flair because it has the Preds colors :)
Predators,33vudu,aidenreed,22,Sun Apr 26 03:57:16 2015 UTC,"My response from the game thread. It hurts, but this team is more than just this series.   ""We have the coach, we have the net minder, we have the young talent, we have the vets to lead the way, we have the fans, and we have the drive. The last two months have been tough, but this team has too many positives to bitch and moan.   Injuries hurt us as did some inconstant play, but this was the most exciting season of Preds hockey in recent memory.   A win and a game seven would have been great. A ticket stamp to the second round even better. It wasn't our year. That year is coming and we are going to bring that goddamned cup to Tennessee.   I am proud of our Perds."""

Predators,33vudu,The_Great_Diddler,9,Sun Apr 26 03:05:18 2015 UTC,"Yep. One good bounce and we win one of those overtime games and come back here for game 7. Rinne was good but not great, and our d-core was mediocre. Let's build on this year and keep Ribs, Wilson and Smith and see what happens. Nobody even picked us for playoffs. I'd love to see a viable franchise goaltender emerge next year as a replacement for Rinne around 2017-2018, and someone who can step in and play 15-20 games a season if necessary. Also, maybe we can stop trading away first round picks."

Predators,33vudu,flirt77,12,Sun Apr 26 03:02:28 2015 UTC,I'm so fucking pissed. The preds have choked in the 2nd and 3rd the entire last quarter of the season and the entire post season.
Predators,33vudu,GoldenDomerAvatar,7,Sun Apr 26 03:03:23 2015 UTC,"Damn, hell of a fight put up in Game 5. Just didn't play well basically the entire 3rd period. Sad to see the season is over but happy with how the season went."

This isn't the last  time we'll see them and next time we'll be more experienced and beat the piss out of them. Pissed as hell, but still an unbelievable season."
Predators,33vudu,snipespb,9,Sun Apr 26 03:19:50 2015 UTC,"That was fun as fuck to watch. As much as I hate the hawks,they know how to win in the post season. Credit to them, but damn losing hurts. Typical tennessee team luck to lose the captain mid series. Silver lining is we have a very young team that should be good for a good long time.   Good luck to the squad that beat us, and I can't wait for next season already."
Predators,33vudu,AmericanSatellite9,23,Sun Apr 26 04:03:40 2015 UTC,"Why is everyone so salty? We played without Weber, Pekka is obviously still hurting from his previous injury, and our star players are young and learning. We have a lot to look forward to in the coming years."
Predators,33vudu,watchit_assblood,20,Sun Apr 26 03:05:01 2015 UTC,"The ""saltyness"" comes from seeing what this team was until the All-Star break and what it became post trade...it just wasn't a good product by comparison.  I think the salt comes from the fact we played for large portions of that series as the better team, without fisher for 2 games and without weber for nearly 4 games.  We were a clutch play on offensive or a solid defensive play away from changing that series.  If you look up and down the series statistic we win every category except the game total, and potentially the face off percentage.  That isn't to say the team didn't play extremely well given the cards that were dealt but there was so much more potential that fell unachieved.  We really struggled defensively without Weber to highly skilled puck handling Chicago's talent has, Rinne was very weak by his standards we have come to expect from him maybe injury related maybe defense related or both, we also had a horrible time of holding on to leads in which we got all series and throughout the last half of the season.  I don't think the salt is as much as it is depression by what we saw and what we go.  I'm upset that this team didn't beat Chicago, I'm upset that our talented forwards couldn't shoot the corners of the goal and could only hit the logo on the goalies jersey.  I'm upset we lost fisher for the last 2 weeks and Weber for the last 4 games, that is a LOT of leadership...I'm excited to see this team one more year developed but we need a 1c or a much stronger 3rd line and the defense needs to play at the level they are capable of."
Predators,33vudu,dotPHUNK,2,Sun Apr 26 03:59:53 2015 UTC,Well said
Predators,33vudu,HotChicken69,8,Sun Apr 26 12:47:33 2015 UTC,Agreed. This series could be in our hands if it wasn't for two OT goals. But we made it here with new faces and a new coach. We have most of them returning and can't wait to see what's in store.

Predators,33vudu,AmericanSatellite9,8,Sun Apr 26 03:02:36 2015 UTC,"I just want to say that it has been one hell of a season. We were expected to be shit, yet we nearly won the central. We lost our captain in game 2, and lost our second best player in game 1, yet played our hearts out all series long. Also 3/4 losses in the series were 1 goal games. I am nothing but proud of this team and am very excited about next year. All i have to say is: LET'S GO PREDATORS!"
Predators,33vudu,predpilot85,5,Sun Apr 26 03:10:02 2015 UTC,"I'm so sad, but I'm also so proud of what our team did this season, and the growth of this subreddit and the community we've managed to build. Stick taps to you all."

We didn't.We kept winning. Writers, bloggers, and analysts continued to overlook us more than half way through the season. We were a mostly new team playing in a new system with a new coach. We should be proud of this team. We fought hard. Next year is our year. Go Preds."
Predators,33vudu,frakking-anustart,12,Sun Apr 26 03:23:17 2015 UTC,"Despite what happened tonight, this is undeniably a good year. Nobody saw Nashville making the playoffs, and forget leading the league for a while. Forsberg broke every Nashville rookie record, and Josi may have been as good as Weber. Ribeiro got his life turned around (and i hope to god he resigns here). Rinne played on his head for most of the season. We have promising prospects, and if we can make it this year, I don't see why we can't next year. This season was a blast, and while it ended on a bad note, I don't think anyone could be disappointed with it. We broke every expectation, and are looking great for next season.  LETS GO PREDS"

Predators,33vudu,lithicstudio,13,Sun Apr 26 05:02:57 2015 UTC,"The future of this organization is looking bright. Sucks to be eliminated in the first round, but unfortunately it happens. We had a hell of a season, came in and surprised everyone. Hate how we ended the season but it's history now.  Our defensive core is incredible. Josi and Weber are here to stay and for a long time, without a doubt the best defensive pairing in the league. Seth Jones is still young, few mistakes here and there but he is 20 and has a bright future. With guys like Ellis, Ekholm, Bartley and Franson. Our team remains stonger on D.  We have one of the best goalies in the world and can't be prouder of him, had a great season and showed there is a reason to fear the Predators. Hutton had great commentary on the bench, loved our Hutton time. Shame there was so much hate on him during the season but he stepped up when Rinne went down.  The offensive prowess of this team is growing. Ribs came out and proved all the haters wrong (commend him for turning his life around). Forsberg had a hell of a first season and can't wait to see him next year, truly a force to be reckoned with. James Neal had a solid first season with this team. Fisher proved how important he was to this team when he came back from injury, especially on the PP. Smith and Wilson have proved just how important they are to this team, not just this season but throughout the playoffs (to the Preds front office, make sure to sign them both back up). The rest of the offense has been quite good too.  Obviously there is room for improvement, need to be better in the faceoffs (that killed us tonight). But we have the offseason to fix what is broken and better what isn't.  Most importantly, thanks to Coach Laviolette and the rest of the coaching staff. You really took this team forward, created a strong offensive team without sacrificing the strong defense and goaltending that this team is known for. Made us a force to be reckoned with and for that we thank you.  Great working Predators. Onwards and upwards in the 15/16 season."

Nashville professional sports teams suck and underperform every time. Between 2 franchises and +-15 years of play you've got nothing but one legitimate Super Bowl appearance and 15+- horrendous playoff appearances.
Predators,33vudu,PTPM_Leroy,6,Sun Apr 26 03:06:42 2015 UTC,I think that it is entirely reasonable for a two-sport city to go 15 years without a championship. We do not have only horrendous playoff appearances either.

Us Preds and Hawks fans have lost a lot of sleep through this series what with the ridiculous over times and tight scoring. It's been fun. Good luck to you guys. And beat whoever wins the Blues/Wild series because fuck those guys!
Predators,33vudu,tuxfile,7,Sun Apr 26 03:29:13 2015 UTC,"Damn good series. You've got a great young team, and I've never been so frustrated as I was watching your defense - without weber no less. Thanks for a mostly clean and fun series, see you next season in the Central meat grinder!"
Predators,33vudu,iPoop20,6,Sun Apr 26 03:34:50 2015 UTC,Intense series preds! You have a fantastic team and can't wait to see you guys next season!
Predators,33vudu,alexkendig,4,Sun Apr 26 03:11:30 2015 UTC,"The Hawks are built for now. The preds time will come. Tough first round draw, poor injury luck, and their top guys played lights out when it mattered. I wouldn't trade teams for anything. The preds are much better set up for success in the next decade. The right moves in the offseason can get them over the hump."
Predators,33vudu,docblue,6,Sun Apr 26 03:42:55 2015 UTC,I was rooting for you guys so hard.  Maybe next year :(
Predators,33vudu,Nickinator96,5,Sun Apr 26 04:37:18 2015 UTC,"Oh God @Drunk_Kane retweeted one of my tweets, now I have hundreds of Hawks fans replying to me..."
Predators,33vudu,fury26,5,Sun Apr 26 03:11:26 2015 UTC,*block* aaaaand repeat.
Predators,33vudu,KakunaUsedHarden,4,Sun Apr 26 03:24:46 2015 UTC,"Hey Predsbros, sorry about the loss. I was pulling for you guys. Chins up though, you had a great season, and I'm sure you guys will be even stronger next year."
Predators,33vudu,wrxie,5,Sun Apr 26 03:32:27 2015 UTC,MRW this game ended
Predators,33vudu,AmericanSatellite9,4,Sun Apr 26 03:03:40 2015 UTC,"Great series. You definitely gave us fits. Cheers to you, Preds fans!! We'll see you next year in the thunderdome!!"
Predators,33vudu,KakunaUsedHarden,5,Sun Apr 26 03:15:35 2015 UTC,One day Fiala and Forsberg will be our Toews and Kane :(
Predators,33vudu,AmericanSatellite9,13,Sun Apr 26 03:19:47 2015 UTC,hopefully the blues/wild shit on them in the second round
Predators,33vudu,GuardianOfFreyja,14,Sun Apr 26 03:53:23 2015 UTC,Man ... I strongly dislike all three of those teams. Go winner of CGY/VAN as long as it's not VAN IMO
Predators,33vudu,Cumdodger,6,Sun Apr 26 03:01:05 2015 UTC,I am now rooting for Calgary to kick the shit out of everyone in the West.
Predators,33vudu,iblamethehiphop,6,Sun Apr 26 03:03:53 2015 UTC,I can't bring myself to cheer for any Western team.
Predators,33vudu,Kinderraven,8,Sun Apr 26 04:14:44 2015 UTC,"Seriously if CGY loses than I strongly dislike the West and will focus my efforts on the east.   Jake Allen is from my home town so ... that makes STL an emotional paradox ...  East Is wide open in terms of fandom. I like MTL, OTT, NYR (to an extent), NYI, Trotz and TBL. So I'll need to pick one there I spose."
Predators,33vudu,rewind2482,5,Sun Apr 26 03:05:38 2015 UTC,"I can't support any STL teams. I guess I could cheer for the Wild so I don't get beat up in the cities.  East coast I'm pulling for WSH or TBL. I love Carey Price but hate Montreal, I guess I wouldn't be too upset to see Leggy do something with the Sens.  This would all be avoided had this series not ended tonight :("
Predators,33vudu,SpottyRasang,8,Sun Apr 26 03:08:53 2015 UTC,"I don't mind the Wild as much as the other two, so at this point I'm hoping the SCF is MIN or CAL vs TBL or WSH."
Predators,33vudu,lithicstudio,7,Sun Apr 26 03:11:52 2015 UTC,I sure hope so man
Predators,33vudu,ArchChisUm,12,Sun Apr 26 03:05:16 2015 UTC,I'm certain the Wild will advance. the Blues are a joke haha.
Predators,33vudu,lgplesgrey,2,Sun Apr 26 03:02:59 2015 UTC,"next day, still sad, oh well.  When do we find out what terrible misfortune befell Weber?"
Predators,33vudu,AllOfYourYes,5,Sun Apr 26 03:07:54 2015 UTC,"Reassuring platitudes aside... and probably drawing the worst possible team...  That's a choke, and you all know it."
Predators,33vudu,Cumdodger,5,Sun Apr 26 15:52:56 2015 UTC,"Great series, guys. You were all pretty cool and respectful here in this sub, and I had a fun time watching and commenting. Maybe we'll see you next year in the playoffs.  Also, Roman Josi sure is a fun person to watch play."
Predators,33vudu,DrWillyTrill,6,Sun Apr 26 03:08:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for joining the discussion and being cool. Appreciate a good outsider perspective as long as they're respectful and not being assholes. Not sure I can bring myself to wish you good luck, but I'm definitely looking forward to watching you guys play some more good hockey."
Predators,33vudu,Sephiroth007,7,Sun Apr 26 03:08:44 2015 UTC,"If it is any consolation whatsoever, I rooted hard for you - watched every second of your games that didn't overlap with the Wings. You should all be proud of your team - there's a very bright future ahead for you guys, and I'm glad we didn't have to play you.  I'll finish with these remarks - keeping in mind I'm a DRW fan living in Chicago: I feel the same as you guys do."
Predators,33vudu,zellthemedic,3,Sun Apr 26 03:41:05 2015 UTC,"We appreciate it. Congrats on tonight, by the way!"
Predators,33vudu,Loki364,6,Sun Apr 26 03:10:42 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm concerned, this was only a taste for next year. Yeah, it sucks we lost in the first round after that incredible first 2/3rds of a season and it sucks even more that we lost to Chicago of all teams. However, I can't be too pissed because the Preds made this series tough for the Hawks and it was an incredibly fun series to watch.  In all honesty, I'm really damn excited for next season :) (and hopefully the winner of the Blues/Wild series can make quick work of Chicago)."
Predators,33vudu,Wyntersun,7,Sun Apr 26 03:18:42 2015 UTC,Man fuck the fucking Hawks
Predators,33w8zn,Gumpyyy,10,Sun Apr 26 05:50:02 2015 UTC,"Fish and Ribs will stay. They both have too big a connection to Nashville to leave. Fish with Carrie and the new kid and Ribs got his life back together here. His wife won't let him go somewhere else. (come to think of it, neither wife will probably let them go somewhere else)"
Predators,33w8zn,befree1231,12,Sun Apr 26 15:21:05 2015 UTC,Girl Power~
Predators,33w8zn,Kinderraven,9,Sun Apr 26 15:55:14 2015 UTC,"And in a nifty little chart:    RFA  UFA    Smith, Wilson, Jarnkrok, Bourque, Beck  Fisher, Cullen, Ribeiro, Volchenkov, Franson, Santorelli    We already made a big free agent signing in Steve Moses, but I'm not sure what other non-Predators are on the market."
Predators,33w8zn,pwnicholson,10,Sun Apr 26 05:52:47 2015 UTC,"Smith and Wilson have played themselves in to big pay days. Arbitration would not be in our favor and we don't want to lose them or their best efforts to an ugly hearing process. Poile needs to get his wallet out, sign them, and move on.  The rest would be nice to keep but we shouldn't overpay them as middle of the road RFAs."
Predators,33w8zn,Deep__Thought,7,Sun Apr 26 06:31:34 2015 UTC,I would like to see matching deals for Smith and Wilson
Predators,33w8zn,lithicstudio,7,Sun Apr 26 14:20:39 2015 UTC,"I see your chart, and raise you the official contract tracker.  http://predators.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=88111    Some interesting notes from the Admirals too... Hellboy and Mazanek both up as RFAs as well as Bitteto and Watson."
Predators,33w8zn,tuxfile,3,Sun Apr 26 06:52:07 2015 UTC,That's handy. I wonder who they'll qualify in Milwaukee.
Predators,33w8zn,codeyh,4,Sun Apr 26 17:36:01 2015 UTC,Everyone.
Predators,33w8zn,Legion991,2,Sun Apr 26 18:09:54 2015 UTC,Hellberg and Maz are must resigns for the Ads.
Predators,33w8zn,pwnicholson,5,Mon Apr 27 00:14:53 2015 UTC,"Fisher and Ribs are our biggest/only ""Must sign"" in UFA, and I'm pretty confident they both want to stick around. RFAs pretty much work themselves out, but they are all big needs for us."
Predators,33w8zn,MunchieMunich,5,Sun Apr 26 06:10:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm expecting a decent hometown/old guy discount for Fish and a ""thank you"" discount on Ribs."
Predators,33w8zn,pwnicholson,7,Sun Apr 26 06:28:36 2015 UTC,"Fish needs no money haha the man is set for life thanks to Carrie. but in all seriousness at this point in his career he isn't looking for the big paycheck, Nashville is where is family is, it's his home, i don't think it'll take too much for him to stay."
Predators,33w8zn,MunchieMunich,8,Sun Apr 26 06:30:13 2015 UTC,Biggest risk for Fish is if he wants to retire and be a daddy full time.
Predators,33w8zn,alexkendig,6,Sun Apr 26 06:32:41 2015 UTC,true. i do think Fish would retire before he'd sign somewhere else. but hopefully he sees the potential not only for the team and himself (he had a very good year considering he came back from a bad injury).
Predators,33w8zn,alexkendig,3,Sun Apr 26 06:34:12 2015 UTC,not a chance.
Predators,33w8zn,golfmade,3,Sun Apr 26 16:36:07 2015 UTC,"Idk, I expect a 1 or 2 year contract. He may still have some fire, but I think he's looking forward to retirement. Just speculation."
Predators,33w8zn,AmericanSatellite9,2,Sun Apr 26 17:29:28 2015 UTC,well he certainly doesn't play like he's anywhere near retiring
Predators,33w8zn,Deep__Thought,8,Sun Apr 26 21:05:43 2015 UTC,It's way to early to think about this :`(  Sigh.
Predators,33w8zn,alexkendig,6,Sun Apr 26 07:22:26 2015 UTC,"I honestly think of Bourque and Beck, we're only going to re-sign one of them just because their play similar games, which is too bad because I really like both of them."
Predators,33w8zn,tuxfile,9,Sun Apr 26 12:41:07 2015 UTC,"Beck has been the better of the two this year I think, but Borque is hard working as well"
Predators,33w8zn,AmericanSatellite9,4,Sun Apr 26 14:25:41 2015 UTC,I was thinking the opposite. Plus Beck made that healthy scratch list a couple times.
Predators,33w8zn,weareallwired,4,Sun Apr 26 16:35:28 2015 UTC,"I really like Beck's game, and he'll be cheaper than Borque. Wonder what they'll do wrt Nystrom."
Predators,33w8zn,zellthemedic,2,Sun Apr 26 17:05:26 2015 UTC,When Beck is on the ice he plays like it's going to be his last shift. I love it.
Predators,33w8zn,befree1231,6,Sun Apr 26 23:48:23 2015 UTC,"I think Fish would want to stay, family, he's a cappy, everyone loves him here. I hope ribs wants to stay because we gave him a shot when most of the NHL wouldn't. We have to hold on to Smith and Wilson, and we need to keep cullen as well. I would be pleased to see minor adjustments, but we have a strong core I hope doesn't change too much."
Predators,33w8zn,the_penis_mightyer,4,Sun Apr 26 15:01:11 2015 UTC,"Smith, Wilson, Ribs, Fisher, possibly Cullen and Bourque.   I'm all too happy to say goodbye to Franson. Santo hasn't made any real impact here. Same with Volchenkov. Beck is good but Bourque is a speed demon."
Predators,33w8zn,jdsummerlin12,9,Sun Apr 26 16:09:34 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm concerned Franson's first name isn't Cody, it's Fuckin'. Because all I ever find myself saying about him is ""Fuckin' Franson!"""
Predators,33w8zn,jackattack615,2,Sun Apr 26 16:55:10 2015 UTC,"We absolutely have to bring back Fisher, Ribs, Wilson, Smith, Cullen, and Jarkrok. I'd like to see Borque, wouldn't mind seeing Beck. Bye bye Volchenkov, Santorelli, and Franson."
Predators,33w8zn,wrxie,2,Mon Apr 27 01:06:03 2015 UTC,"We'll keep the RFAs. (Thank you restricted contracts.) Ribs comes back on the cheap. Fisher comes back if he's healthy. I think the others go with the young talent coming up. If Cullen, Santa and Franson want to come back, they can't name their price. Because of that, I think they walk on their own."
Predators,33w8zn,codeyh,2,Mon Apr 27 01:50:54 2015 UTC,"Smith, Wilson, Jarnkrok, Beck, Fisher, Ribs. The rest can go IMO. Smith, Wilson, Fisher, Ribs, are no brainers. Beck we should be able to resign for cheap and Jarnkrok can take over for Bourque on PK and that defensive role, but with a little bigger offensive upside."
Predators,33w8zn,reversewolverine,2,Mon Apr 27 11:33:48 2015 UTC,"I really just want Smith, Wilson, Calle, Ribs and Fisher back. The rest can go elsewhere. Though  Beck might be nice too."
Predators,33vapr,Gumpyyy,13,Sat Apr 25 23:39:20 2015 UTC,Hope Lavy brought a big jar of jam for the intermission.
Predators,33vapr,matt5605,9,Sun Apr 26 01:14:18 2015 UTC,"LET ME KNOW IF MY LIVE DRINKING UPDATES ARE ANNOYING AND I'LL STOP  Hello,  /u/AmericanSatellite9 requested I post this here so that we could record our drinking activities. Let's party.   http://i.imgur.com/TdR7sLd.png  Also if anyone wants to go 'Hero Mode' there's also the Doc Emirick drinking game  Let's make this whole 7 games thing happen eh?   Beer 1 ... DROP THE FUCKING PUCK...cheers guys  9:21 - I hear there were some reasons to drink pre-game but I'm starting at puck drop ... although the Corey Crawford bench shot during the Anthem was questionable.   9:23 - Shot of Laviolette chewing his gum but he's calm ... still no drinks.   GOOOALLLLLL CELEBRATORY DRINKKK WHAT A BEAUTY  9:30 - boys seem to be actually aiming their shots today. Not a lot right at Darling, but it's early yet.    9:31 - Shot at Darling's chest by Forsberg, one drink  9:33 Coming back from TV Timeout and it's Crawford on the bench! That's a drink  9:36 GOAAALLLLL ... Shot of Crawford on the bench, tipped by Neal. That's 2 drinks though  9:37 - oh shit video review count the angles 1 ... 2. Forgiving. Only two angles. Oh another shot of Crawford on the bench. three drinks total folks.   9:39 - Feeling that last sequence ^  9:42 - booooo  9:44 - 3-1 Shot of Crawford on the bench. He's coming in apparently, which means we go to the competitions committee for the rule change and yes, we now drink whenever there's a shot of Darling on the bench.   9:50 - Beer two apparently starts with a Powerplay goal for Chicago, a video review (1 angle) and a shot of Darling on the bench. 3 drinks early in.  10:08 3-3 and a shot of Laviolette angrily chewing his gum. I'll take two because I can't believe they're back in this.  End of the second. First period winner was ""Shots of the Backup on the bench"" with 5 drinks. Runner up was Goal revew angles with a surprising 3.    10:38 - Drink every time youre wife thinks the middle of play in a Preds playoff game is the appropriate time to deal with your cats mats.  10:52 - man ... this broadcast is much less repetitive than game 5. Onto beer three but have drinking on my own will for much of the 2nd. Although this Pierre McGuire story giving a detail history on Rinne's draft deserves something on it's own. Actually Imma fire up the Doc drinking game.   10:57 WAIT I think that was a pad save by Rinne followed by a mention of how much he likes to use his glove. That's 3 folks.   11:05 Third Period Update YAWWWNNNNN wasn't that painfully boring. NHL15 time then let's finish er off.   11:25 Potato quality piture of my cat and I and the remaining half of beer 3 as we kick off the do or die 3rd   11:51 Hawks pull ahead. Chug that beer. Let's get a new one. This is going to be a tough finish."

Predators,33vapr,Wyntersun,6,Sun Apr 26 00:51:55 2015 UTC,Maybe try Roszi or Oduya...seems like their defense is also to blame for our goal flurries :D
Predators,33vapr,matt5605,10,Sun Apr 26 00:55:39 2015 UTC,Not a good way to end the first period
Predators,33vapr,alexkendig,3,Sun Apr 26 01:08:39 2015 UTC,this year we seem to always give up goals to the Hawks in the final seconds and its really getting old.
Predators,33vapr,unemotional_wreck,10,Sun Apr 26 01:20:08 2015 UTC,"Anyone else see the Blackhawks are just sitting and waiting on our Power Play? They know our defense will pass several times before a low percentage shot. With 4 of their guys just protecting any rebounds, our PP will never be effective with this strategy. All Chicago has to do is let us keep Passing and wait on a poor pass or low percentage shot to clear the puck. I can only hope Lavi already sees this and makes the change!"
Predators,33vapr,matt5605,7,Sun Apr 26 01:18:00 2015 UTC,Definitely don't need to waste a minute of PP opportunity passing.
Predators,33vapr,unemotional_wreck,5,Sun Apr 26 01:19:11 2015 UTC,Agreed! We need someone to step up and win some faceoffs for us as well. Ribeiro has many good qualities but winning faceoffs is one he needs to develop.
Predators,33vapr,matt5605,3,Sun Apr 26 01:22:43 2015 UTC,I'm really surprised how many faceoffs Goose has lost since he's the go to guy.

Predators,33vapr,AmericanSatellite9,4,Sun Apr 26 00:51:53 2015 UTC,He's bringing me flashbacks of my first relationship.  Initially fueled with love and passion.  Then he breaks my heart.  But I can't help but love him.  I want to believe that he will bring passion back to our lives.
Predators,33vapr,hic2482w1,8,Sun Apr 26 00:57:00 2015 UTC,Isn't holding an opponents stick a penalty?
Predators,33vapr,reckoner15,6,Sun Apr 26 00:58:05 2015 UTC,"Hawks did a LOT of that last game, never got called."
Predators,33vapr,Bocheetus,8,Sun Apr 26 01:01:57 2015 UTC,I've already seen it a few times this game from them.
Predators,33vapr,matt5605,6,Sun Apr 26 01:04:13 2015 UTC,Well...that period did not end the way I thought it would.
Predators,33vapr,zellthemedic,8,Sun Apr 26 01:09:35 2015 UTC,"We haven't really challenged Crawford since he's come in. For god sakes, Ribeiro had a chance by himself 2 feet away, but as we all know, he refuses to shoot. Hopefully we can get some better shots at him in the 2nd."
Predators,33vapr,Propeller3,9,Sun Apr 26 01:10:27 2015 UTC,"Three sips if Ribs shoots, if anyone is playing"
Predators,33vapr,LambHammer,7,Sun Apr 26 01:11:10 2015 UTC,All right all right.  Restart time.

Predators,33vapr,matt5605,5,Sun Apr 26 02:50:40 2015 UTC,MY HEART CAN'T TAKE IT BUT I'M WATCHING ANYWAY LET'S GO PREDS!
Predators,33vapr,lithicstudio,5,Sat Apr 25 23:49:09 2015 UTC,"I usually don't wear jerseys at home, but I wore my 2011 Weber jersey at both Playoff wins, so I'm not taking this thing off."

Predators,33vapr,matt5605,8,Sun Apr 26 00:24:44 2015 UTC,"Goal!!! (I probably woke up some neighbors, sorry ;P)"

Predators,33vapr,TheRadBomber,4,Sun Apr 26 00:39:55 2015 UTC,Franson proving the PPG was just a fluke. Back to normal.
Predators,33vapr,esNOW_Spectruuh,7,Sun Apr 26 00:43:10 2015 UTC,We will also get that one back.
Predators,33vapr,alexkendig,7,Sun Apr 26 00:48:21 2015 UTC,"Hawks PP goal. Neal, as punishment for that penalty you need to get more goals."
Predators,33vapr,esNOW_Spectruuh,7,Sun Apr 26 00:48:58 2015 UTC,Gotta stop icing it.
Predators,33vapr,Way_She_Goes,6,Sun Apr 26 01:01:43 2015 UTC,This is just the first period!!
Predators,33vapr,Bocheetus,7,Sun Apr 26 01:10:44 2015 UTC,I'm following this on the ESPN app with my Hawks Friend giving me the play by play over texts I wish I was watching this game so bad. Being employed sucks sometimes

Predators,33vapr,inviscidfluid,6,Sun Apr 26 01:34:24 2015 UTC,we just had a 4 on 2 and dumped it straight into their shin pads. Calm down and make the right plays with the puck boys.

Predators,33vapr,matt5605,4,Sun Apr 26 02:12:25 2015 UTC,Back to back hat tricks plz.
Predators,33vapr,bicuspidpayload,7,Sun Apr 26 02:14:40 2015 UTC,I am sorry. :(
Predators,33vapr,matt5605,5,Sun Apr 26 03:00:30 2015 UTC,thanks for pulling for us.
Predators,33vapr,golfmade,5,Sun Apr 26 03:02:01 2015 UTC,Well. It was a good year.
Predators,33vapr,bubbaganoush79,5,Sun Apr 26 03:00:40 2015 UTC,This pressure cooker is insane.
Predators,33vapr,matt5605,6,Sat Apr 25 23:51:06 2015 UTC,Here's to the Prince leading us to victory and bringing game 7 back home.
Predators,33vapr,LambHammer,4,Sat Apr 25 23:58:04 2015 UTC,"That punk? We need someone gritty  like clune to lead the team to victory in the playoffs, not some kid who's not even a Calder finalist."
Predators,33vapr,matt5605,3,Sun Apr 26 00:15:36 2015 UTC,Very true
Predators,33vapr,golfmade,5,Sun Apr 26 00:22:11 2015 UTC,"Play fast, hit hard, stay out of the box and LET'S GO PREDS!"
Predators,33vapr,LambHammer,4,Sun Apr 26 00:11:12 2015 UTC,"Preds,  Do not go gentle into that good night.  Rage, rage against the dying of the light."

Predators,33vapr,golfmade,4,Sun Apr 26 00:37:08 2015 UTC,Someone's looking for a hat trick ;)
Predators,33vapr,lithicstudio,5,Sun Apr 26 00:37:38 2015 UTC,Corey Crawford already looks like cupcake dog.
Predators,33vapr,golfmade,4,Sun Apr 26 00:38:45 2015 UTC,Looks a bit like Jon Snow to me.
Predators,33vapr,Xanken,5,Sun Apr 26 00:40:32 2015 UTC,I've been thinking this the whole time.
Predators,33vapr,esNOW_Spectruuh,6,Sun Apr 26 00:41:33 2015 UTC,damn it Franson
Predators,33vapr,matt5605,6,Sun Apr 26 00:42:30 2015 UTC,YOU MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL FRANSONS
Predators,33vapr,inviscidfluid,5,Sun Apr 26 00:43:12 2015 UTC,I was asleep and it was 2-0. As I'm waking up the Hawks cut the lead. :( I have to go out tonight.
Predators,33vapr,esNOW_Spectruuh,5,Sun Apr 26 00:44:31 2015 UTC,If Crawford is a sieve do the Blackhawks have a third goalie?
Predators,33vapr,c3ndre,8,Sun Apr 26 00:46:34 2015 UTC,Raanta destroyed us earlier this year... no idea if he's healthy or not though...    Edit: Nevermind - that was James Neal's hattrick night. Must have been Darling I was thinking of.
Predators,33vapr,matt5605,4,Sun Apr 26 00:46:58 2015 UTC,Hossa off to the box.
Predators,33vapr,matt5605,4,Sun Apr 26 00:57:33 2015 UTC,Premature whistle there buddy
Predators,33vapr,zellthemedic,5,Sun Apr 26 01:35:09 2015 UTC,FUCKING SHOOT
Predators,33vapr,inviscidfluid,5,Sun Apr 26 01:45:18 2015 UTC,FUCK!!!! How did we not bury that shit
Predators,33vapr,travisd05,3,Sun Apr 26 01:45:25 2015 UTC,because the second goalie in is invincible to us.
Predators,33vapr,zellthemedic,5,Sun Apr 26 01:47:24 2015 UTC,Can't get any meaningful people possession and keep turning it over. Just have to keep shooting at Craw and eventually it'll go in.
Predators,33vapr,LambHammer,5,Sun Apr 26 01:53:57 2015 UTC,Pekka doing a good job again.
Predators,33vapr,Bocheetus,5,Sun Apr 26 01:57:57 2015 UTC,Can we please win a face off
Predators,33vapr,zellthemedic,6,Sun Apr 26 01:58:29 2015 UTC,Ok we've started winning face offs.  Can we play with the intensity from the first 10 min of the 1st period and score some more goals?
Predators,33vapr,lithicstudio,5,Sun Apr 26 02:01:59 2015 UTC,Hey! Okay! I just got home! Someone give me the skinny low down on what's been going on!
Predators,33vapr,Borovy3488,6,Sun Apr 26 02:04:31 2015 UTC,"first 10 was great. then we let them get back in by not winning faceoffs. Then the second period looked like a 20 minute power play but somehow pekka stopped everything. I'm glad we survived that second period, but we have to do much better the third or we can start booking tee times."
Predators,33vapr,alexkendig,4,Sun Apr 26 02:07:49 2015 UTC,Preds dominated at the beginning of the 1st. Went up 3-1. Then lost momentum and kept losing faceoffs. The Hawks tied it up 3-3 by the end of the first. 2nd period just ended and it's still 3-3.
Predators,33vapr,Way_She_Goes,5,Sun Apr 26 02:06:20 2015 UTC,3rdators ftw?
Predators,33vapr,AmericanSatellite9,5,Sun Apr 26 02:06:57 2015 UTC,"Game started awesome.  Darling got butthurt 11 minutes in, and had to leave.   There's other stuff, but you'll find out.  The National anthem had a real Blackhawk in a wheelchair."
Predators,33vapr,Grozak,3,Sun Apr 26 02:08:45 2015 UTC,"Came out hot.  Neal got 2.  3-1, the 3-2, then 3-3 on a last second rocket by Kane.  Darling got pulled.  Second period was pretty weak.  Preds couldn't maintain posession.  Pekka is making quality saves.  Ribs wont shoot.  Solid hits.  The second period collapse is over.  Lets bring on the third period goalsplosion."
Predators,33vapr,CurseOfTheCLG,4,Sun Apr 26 02:07:18 2015 UTC,Ribs wont shoot.   Story of our lives post-January.
Predators,33vapr,c3ndre,5,Sun Apr 26 02:16:07 2015 UTC,Not Jarny! Pls be OK.
Predators,33vapr,G_Daddy2014,4,Sun Apr 26 02:30:54 2015 UTC,God fucking damnit.
Predators,33vapr,G_Daddy2014,10,Sun Apr 26 03:00:17 2015 UTC,I know I keep harping on Olczyk but Jesus. Everytime we score he's so bleh about it and surprised Nashville is scoring. Chicago scores and he's pumped. Come on...
Predators,33vapr,reckoner15,9,Sun Apr 26 00:50:37 2015 UTC,Remember that time we held onto the lead on the road? Yeah me neither.
Predators,33vapr,tuxfile,8,Sun Apr 26 01:14:15 2015 UTC,Still two periods hombré
Predators,33vapr,AmericanSatellite9,19,Sun Apr 26 01:15:29 2015 UTC,"Blues fan here.  Checking in to say the NBC dicksucking of the shithawks is out of hand, Pierre needs to lose his mic, and fuck the hawks!"
Predators,33vapr,AmericanSatellite9,10,Sun Apr 26 00:46:35 2015 UTC,"Blackhawks are really lucky that shea isn't playing, or maybe not I should say, because preds are gonna win. I don't appreciate the lack of faith from some of you. Believe!!"
Predators,33vapr,predsrule,8,Sun Apr 26 01:24:50 2015 UTC,They defeated Darling!
Predators,33vapr,Bocheetus,6,Sun Apr 26 00:44:24 2015 UTC,It's getting ROWDY at Bridgestone.

Predators,33vapr,matt5605,7,Sun Apr 26 01:16:34 2015 UTC,"Hawks coverage was very terrible. A lot of blame rests on the shoulders of the players in front of Darling. That said, your goaltender is supposed to make stops.   All of this equally applies to the Predators late play."

Predators,33uqj3,Gumpyyy,9,Sat Apr 25 20:34:15 2015 UTC,"Just to break it down: Other than the 1 win over us, we lead in every quoted statistic.  Its not like I put these two columns together either. It appears just like that on their website.  http://www.nhl.com/gamecenter/en/preview?id=2014030166&navid=sb:preview&intcmpid=sb-preview"

It's more than the team stats for the series. The way they have it presented in your link, though, doesn't make a lot of sense."
Predators,33uqj3,WrongWayKid,-1,Sat Apr 25 21:15:12 2015 UTC,Man that's pretty original.
Predators,33uqj3,WrongWayKid,4,Sat Apr 25 22:43:50 2015 UTC,"I'll put this here since either you/a mod deleted your comment.  Probably around 1998 was when I first started following the team, I moved to Chicago when I was about 8, and honestly coverage outside the Chicago Wolves was rare. That being said winning championships will always bring in new fans, but Dollar Bill Wirtz's handling of the team was a major contributor to the sharp decline in the Blackhawk following between 1995-2005ish it's no surprise the team saw increases in attendance once he passed away and his son took over and made right of his fathers wrong doings.  There are more factors to the following of the Blackhawks outside of ""LOL THEY GOT GOOD, FUCKING BANDWAGONERS""."
Predators,33uqj3,iamkanyesouth,0,Sat Apr 25 23:04:41 2015 UTC,Well does this take into account the original 6 team advantage awarded Chicago in each game.  You know where they can 6 on 5 skaters.

Predators,33tv7q,Jcart665,15,Sat Apr 25 16:08:27 2015 UTC,Oh and something else that I forgot to mention was that we sat next to Tyler Hubbard from Florida Georgia Line.  He was a really cool guy and yelled at Patrick Kane the entire game.
Predators,33tv7q,lgplesgrey,2,Sat Apr 25 17:58:25 2015 UTC,He's a preds fan? No way!
Predators,33tv7q,wrxie,3,Sat Apr 25 20:29:44 2015 UTC,Yeah he was at the game. They put him on the jumbotron a bunch of times.
Predators,33tv7q,Bocheetus,8,Sat Apr 25 22:01:23 2015 UTC,That's awesome!!!!
Predators,33tv7q,inviscidfluid,7,Sat Apr 25 16:20:29 2015 UTC,That's awesome! I went during one of the snow nights and sat in the lower bowl and I won tickets like 10 years ago from channel 4 for 2 lower bowl tickets. That is pretty much my only experience down there.
Predators,33tv7q,aidenreed,6,Sat Apr 25 16:20:28 2015 UTC,Similar experience for me. After the first I saw an empty seat in the second row and the people next to me were super nice and said that they have like 8 front row seats for season tickets and that they would get me into the lexus lounge. Turns out I got to go in and I was talking to the man and we exchanged numbers and he texted me later and told me he could hook me up with some cheap front row tickets next year for really cheap. He said I was a true predators fan and didn't hold me being a leafs fan against me!
Predators,33tv7q,DuxF,12,Sat Apr 25 17:20:52 2015 UTC,"I've heard from multiple people that their experiences with the team, reps, fan relations and whatnot have been nothing but fantastic and puts the team across the river's to absolute shame."
Predators,33tv7q,cottonmouthVII,4,Sat Apr 25 17:17:35 2015 UTC,That's awesome. Jeff is a great guy. Had nothing but great experiences with him.

Pekks had an amazing year, but Price had nowhere near as good of a defense in front of him and still put up absolutely mind-boggling numbers.   I'm so proud of Pekks and all the boys for this season but alas, we know how this one ends."

Predators,33rhve,KakunaUsedHarden,4,Fri Apr 24 23:13:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Dubnyk turned his season the hell around but Pekks is by far the better goalie both on the season and in their careers."
Predators,33rhve,madame-dupont,2,Sat Apr 25 00:16:29 2015 UTC,"For fucks sake, Dub didn't turn his season around, he went from one of the worst defensive teams to one of the best. He was amazing for us too, he just didn't have a world class defense in front of him"
Predators,33rhve,the_bert,9,Sat Apr 25 04:52:24 2015 UTC,Two Nashville legends getting nominated for Veznia. What a year it has been.

Predators,33rale,golfmade,3,Sat Apr 25 00:09:11 2015 UTC,I've got an update. Half the signs I posted are already torn down. I was driving past one and there was a Chicago sign in it's place. I would've taken a pic but I was driving. I'm about to go back home and print a Preds sign to post over it.
Predators,33rale,lgplesgrey,3,Sat Apr 25 13:20:51 2015 UTC,Battle of the posters. I like it.
Predators,33qk0k,asphinctersayswhat,21,Fri Apr 24 18:09:46 2015 UTC,"While Weber may be out for the rest of the games against Chicago, we can still win this series. Yesterday and Game Two showed that we are a very strong and powerful team and I think we all can agree we can take the next game.   We have Fisher back and already as soon as he was back on the ice, the team play was much better and confidence was even higher (we also showed that Darling isn't invincible once again)"
Predators,33qk0k,Oddsock1701,9,Fri Apr 24 18:12:06 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah, man. This team doesn't give up and barring any more classic Fruitcup moments I think we can really take it to Chicago at home."
Predators,33qk0k,madame-dupont,3,Fri Apr 24 18:13:15 2015 UTC,All we have right now is two must-win games in a row. The Preds have won twice in a row before and they can sure as fuck do it again
Predators,33qk0k,Tactial_snail,4,Fri Apr 24 21:34:12 2015 UTC,I hope we light Darling up in game 6 (I assume that he's starting) that way they might have a tough decision to make for game 7
Predators,33qk0k,matt5605,3,Fri Apr 24 19:14:11 2015 UTC,I have a feeling Forsberg is in his head afyer that first goal. If the team gets a couple quick ones like that and the team will plant a flag between his ears.
Predators,33qk0k,oatmealfoot,4,Sat Apr 25 01:22:16 2015 UTC,It's been confirmed that Darling is starting Game 6
Predators,33qk0k,G_Daddy2014,5,Fri Apr 24 19:23:01 2015 UTC,I was honestly thinking the same thing! Nothing brings a team's confidence down whenever they face elimination and goalie controversy.
Predators,33qk0k,wrxie,5,Fri Apr 24 20:07:29 2015 UTC,I think we have dominated most of the games. And 2 games with played with less people than them. I think it's completely doable.
Predators,33qk0k,AmericanSatellite9,5,Fri Apr 24 19:14:48 2015 UTC,This series could be over already in favor of the Preds if just a few bounces went our way.
Predators,33qk0k,wrxie,4,Fri Apr 24 20:03:51 2015 UTC,"Well we've dominated most of the games, except game 3."
Predators,33qk0k,AmericanSatellite9,5,Fri Apr 24 21:38:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed. We've dominated except for the 2nd period of Game 1 and Game 3 as a whole, does not change if we had had a few more bounces go our way in the OT of Game 1 and Game 4 we would be getting ready for a matchup with STL or MIN.  Edit: For clarity"
Predators,33qk0k,reversewolverine,3,Fri Apr 24 21:42:42 2015 UTC,We've outhit the blackhawks 213 to 156 this series so far.
Predators,33qk0k,woodfinx,7,Fri Apr 24 19:36:23 2015 UTC,I heard broken foot. Apparently from someone that lives near him. Obviously not a valid source.
Predators,33qk0k,jdsummerlin12,2,Fri Apr 24 21:11:47 2015 UTC,I don't think that's what it is. It didn't look like that on the hit and I heard he was walking after Game 2. Friend of mine believes he got his leg cut by a skate
Predators,33qk0k,inviscidfluid,3,Fri Apr 24 23:40:01 2015 UTC,"They have been very good about keeping this one a secret if our guesses are acl tear, broken foot, and cut leg."

Predators,33ra39,pwnicholson,3,Sat Apr 25 02:34:32 2015 UTC,I seriously doubt Poile would sign a rookie with no North American hockey experience to a 1 way contract.
Predators,33ra39,LaserLynx,1 point,Sat Apr 25 13:04:19 2015 UTC,I was looking at the age. Seems weird to sign a 24 year old prospect.

Predators,33ra39,white_hart_lane,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:30:29 2015 UTC,"I would be shocked if Poile resigns Franson considering we still need to lock up Jones and Ekholm in the back-end AND almost every one of our forwards. We need a good lefty to pair with Jones, and between Bartley, Bittetto, free agents, Volchenkov again, or now Nakyva, we have a lot of options. Nakyva led the SHL in goals and is decent size, if he can adjust to the smaller ice this will be an awesome signing."

If we wanted to force a game 7, the crowd had to show up and holy crap we did. Now let's take a deep breath and find the way to actually channel this win and not let it blow our heads up.

I didn't swap it back on at the start of the third 'cause we've got the Flames game going also. Then BOOM! 3 Goals. I will keep the sound off for the rest of the season.

Predators,33odrk,Merrai,6,Fri Apr 24 06:16:12 2015 UTC,"After the last game, I am not gonna lie, I was very skeptical like most. But I feel like last nights game could be the spark this team needs to win the series. Fisher really provided a spark this team hasn't had the past two games. Feel much more optimistic about the Preds chances. Let's do it boys!!"
Predators,33odrk,El_Deartay,6,Fri Apr 24 07:45:08 2015 UTC,I really think having Fish back is huge for us mentally
Predators,33odrk,MunchieMunich,3,Fri Apr 24 13:29:21 2015 UTC,And physically. I think Fisher's been the missing x-factor for the team.

Predators,33ql30,Oddsock1701,5,Fri Apr 24 18:17:57 2015 UTC,"He is a very talented goalie but is by far outshined by Pekka Rinne. Playing him in times as crucial as this would be a very risky move.   But I foresee him getting a bit more playtime next season. Ive always lived in Nashville and been a Preds fan but I'm also a big Leafs fan. I jumped on the opportunity to see them play back in February and I was impressed by that amazing save he did. Unfortunately (and fortunately for a Leafs fan) the Leafs scored a lot more than I initially expected.  He had great potential to get better, but playing him right now would be a bad decision."
Predators,33ql30,aidenreed,4,Fri Apr 24 18:28:57 2015 UTC,"Difficult to say. They could've used him more during the regular season, but I'm not sure if it'd be a good idea at the moment."

Definitely a slight, that guy was one of the reasons for your teams offensive resurgence.   I love Ekblad but the Panthers failed to get into the playoffs, which should be considered.

Predators,33newl,Vorrigan,4,Fri Apr 24 01:01:18 2015 UTC,"As much as I love Filip I don't know if I can blame Ekblad, who I personally hope wins. The Calder is for best rookie, not necessarily needing to push them into the playoffs."

I know Filip got cold at the end of the season (in all fairness, the whole team did). He still ended the season with the most points on the team. He was a huge part of the team through the whole season.   As others have said, I'm not entirely surprised but damn."
Predators,33newl,tuxfile,9,Thu Apr 23 23:21:37 2015 UTC,Fun fact - Forsberg is just 1 point shy of the other two forwards. That's one denied goal from earlier in the season difference to tie.  I hope Ekblad gets it now.

Predators,33newl,reversewolverine,5,Thu Apr 23 23:18:09 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but that is a pretty fucking atrocious snub."
Predators,33newl,AmericanSatellite9,3,Thu Apr 23 23:20:05 2015 UTC,This is stupid. Can't say I'm surprised though. We were once favored to win almost all the awards. Carey took the Vezina and the Hart. Josi and Weber nixed each other. Forsberg is getting snubbed. and I wouldn't be surprised if Lavi and Poile get passed up too (though I think at least one of them will get their respective award.
Predators,33newl,alexkendig,2,Fri Apr 24 04:34:36 2015 UTC,That is absolute bull shit.
Predators,33newl,GuardianOfFreyja,2,Thu Apr 23 23:11:51 2015 UTC,how in the hell does that even happen? all season they've been predicting he would win it and he doesn't even get nominated? Even if you consider the 5 week slump this still doesn't make sense.   Is Lavy gonna get snubbed from the Jack Adams list next?
Predators,33newl,frakking-anustart,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:44:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think he gets snubbed from the list, but it wouldn't surprise me if Yeo/Trotz, Vigneault and Hartley were the finalists either"

We belly flopped into the playoffs as 8th seed. People didn't know why an AHL team was playing.   We were up against the pre-cap era Detroit Red Wings who had Steve Yzerman, Brendan Shannahan, Lidstrom, Chelios, Whitney, a toddler Zetterberg, god damn Brett fucking Hull.   Everyone was counting us out in an unprecedented 3 games. Three drubbings and then a forfeit.   It started according to plan, dropped both games in Detroit before coming back to Nashville, the former Gaylord Entertainment center, and STUNNED Them. Our first ever home ice playoff game.   We gritted the shit out of them. We won the next two before dropping game 6 at home. But you want to see a series. That was a fucking series. That's who we were and part of who we always will be. We don't quit. Especially not down 3-1 coming into our barn.   Here you go. The first ever playoff game in Nashville Tennessee.. We could do it then, we sure as hell can do it now."

My first game was actually game 2 of this series and I've gotta say, that is by far the best decision I've ever made! Seeing the preds kill the hawks like that was something of my dreams for real! The atmosphere in that arena was so amazing and it was just an overall great experience. I'm so excited to see all that comes out of this team and I know we've got more fight in us!  And I will actually be heading out to Nashville here in a few minutes to cheer on the preds in the game tonight!"
Predators,33lqts,iamkanyesouth,3,Thu Apr 23 16:03:05 2015 UTC,I was at that game!  My first post season game for any sport ever and it was incredible.  I was sitting in front of an entire row of Blackhawks fans and I gotta say those last two goals felt soooo good.  God the noise in the arena was overpowering.  Fantastic.
Predators,33lqts,laniastarpower,3,Thu Apr 23 16:12:09 2015 UTC,I was there too.  It was insane.  Goal 5 broke Crawfords heart/soul.
Predators,33lqts,matt5605,5,Thu Apr 23 16:26:32 2015 UTC,"I grew up with the Preds, my first game was in ~1999 (I was five) and I've gone to games every year after that. I brought my backpack during middle school and high school and did homework during the game so I would never have to miss. Games have always just been fun for me and something I bonded with my dad and brothers over; I still don't know all the rules and stats but I'm trying to learn it all now. The Predators feel like family to me.   This has been an exciting season, it'll be a hit if we lose tonight. However, this team can be really surprising-- I'll be cheering loud at tonight's game.   The team will be even better next season."
Predators,33lqts,iamkanyesouth,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:20:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with you there.  For a team so under estimated at the beginning of the season to go on an run train for the majority of the season, I can't not be happy.  No matter what, the team is way better than the end of last season and with our young talent I only see us getting better (excerpt loserberg...he is the worst)."

Predators,33lqts,iamkanyesouth,12,Thu Apr 23 17:43:04 2015 UTC,"Ok this is a long one.  I grew up playing football.  Was fortunate enough that it payed for a college degree.  I never thought about hockey because East Tennessee didn't have anythung to do with hockey.  My first game was Preds vs. Stars 7 years ago.  What happened that night kicked off a developing love for the sport.  Seats were 2nd from the glass in section 116.  It was a preseason game.  I am not a rich fan just lucked into some tickets.  The people in front of me were extremely rich.  So I'm watching the game for the first time ever, and I'm blown away at the speed and skill of the puck handlers.  Not only that but the way a game can turn on a dime wins and losses determined in literal seconds.  It made me very anxious and nervous.  This is not football.  We take a knee with 45 seconds left to go and call it a game.  In hockey you can't.  So I'm drinking behind this couple in really nice clothes standing over them and hitting the glass, basically being an ass hole.  The woman is ice fucking cold.  Legs crossed and her purse(probably worth more than my car) planted on her lap.  Not saying a damn thing or moving for that matter.  Game goes on like this till the third period.  When one our guys pens a Stars player to the glass right in front of us.  His face is pressed to the glass the way you would want tits pressed to your windshield at a topless car wash.  So ice queen uncrossed her legs and with her stiletto and BOOM kicked the glass right where his face was.  IT WAS THE COLDEST THING IVE SEEN IN MY LIFE.  Then she pops right back into place.  Legs crossed purse in lap.  Didn't say a word or in any other way react.  I lost my shit.  Even the player looked at her with such disgust.  His head popped off the glass.  Dude felt it any you could see it.  I've been going to a few games a year and watching on tv ever since.  I made the decision after last season to become a hardcore fan this year.  I read up on trades read the rumor websites.  I plugged in and we have only missed watching non-televised games this year.  We've been to about 20 this year.  My 5 year old has started playing hockey at Ford Ice.  My favorite player.  James Neal.  Because with him coming it was the biggest signal to our fans that the front office was serious about putting pucks to the net. TL;DR:  first time watching a game was amazed by unexpected fan violence on top of fast paced game play, hooked for life now.  GO PREDS!!! EDIT:  Might have been section 115/116"
Predators,33lqts,HotChicken69,2,Thu Apr 23 16:24:46 2015 UTC,I was really hoping there'd be a yard sale in front of Ice Queen's seat at another point during the game wherein a flying skate or glove catches her right in the face. Can't stand people who don't care about a game/concert/show taking up the best seats just because they can afford to.
Predators,33lqts,predfan664,2,Thu Apr 23 22:21:17 2015 UTC,"I was amazed the entire night.  However after that happened I just imagined that she was actually seething with rage at the Dallas Stars.  Then given the tiniest window, struck against the team she hated so much in the only way she could.  In all probability she was just a rich ice queen.  I just love inventing backstories for people I don't know."

Predators,33lqts,iamkanyesouth,5,Thu Apr 23 16:51:25 2015 UTC,"I have been a die hard Predators fan for the longest time. I can not remember my first game but I do remember the first ever playoff series in the GEC (Gaylord Entertainment Center) and I remember going to the NHL draft in 2003. Favorite non-game experience was the rally to save the Preds. Favorite regular season game was the 8-0 shutout of the Wings, and favorite playoff moment was 4/20/2012 when we beat the Wings in the playoffs. I have a gold Rinne jersey that I wear to all home games. Record when i wear it is like 11-2-1. The superstitions that I have is when I am at the Bridgestone I have to walk around the bottom concourse at least 3 times during the intermissions and I only change up what I wear to the games when they lose a game. Favorite non popular player is Bartley and favorite popular player is Weber. I tell people where can you go to a hockey game and get a chance to see people like Charlie Daniels, Alice Cooper and Vince Gill play."

I love the team and feel like while I may be in the UK but I'm just as much as a fan as other people!"
Predators,33lqts,Deep__Thought,3,Thu Apr 23 20:01:37 2015 UTC,Condolences for your aunt.  Seems kind of a badass to move from the UK to Nashville.  Hope you get to watch the game tonight we'll scream for you from section 328!!!

Predators,33lqts,Wyntersun,3,Fri Apr 24 02:13:22 2015 UTC,"Getting into hockey:   I got into hockey when I found out that I had landed a job out of college in the Nashville area. One of the guys interviewing me mentioned that Nashville had a good hockey team and that I should try and catch a few games. I decided to watch the Stanley Cup final that night to familiarize myself with the sport and to celebrate getting a job.   It was at game two and I finished out the series. I moved up to Tennessee, stopped by Bridgestone and got a home jersey and waited out the lockout. Took advantage of the two-for-one deal when the lockout was over.   I watched the Preds lose in a shootout to the Blues and the Blue Jackets, but I was hooked.   Favorite moment:   Mike Fisher's game winner in the dying seconds against the Kings in 2013.  Not only was it an exciting finish, but it was a game I had taken my dad to. Now I'm back at home with my family getting a second degree at UAH (going to attend hockey games there this fall) and have got him watching the playoffs with me.   So go Preds, keep this series up because I want to see you a few more times before I have a summer of hitting the F5 key keeping up on trade news."
Predators,33lqts,Wyntersun,2,Thu Apr 23 17:41:45 2015 UTC,"What's your favorite Predators memory?    From this season, its gotta be this   First game experience?    For Thrashers: Inaugural season, I dont remember if it was the Pens or the Rags I saw first. I dont remember the score either. I have seen so many Thrashers games and its been so long that they all just run together.  For Preds: 2012 playoff series against Detroit, first home game of the series, Preds win 3-2. I had followed the team throughout the regular season, but hadn't had time to go see a game. Made the drive up from Atlanta with my dad and we saw game 1. Saw game 5 later when we won the series. After that we saw game 3 against the Yotes a 2-0 shutout.    Why are you a fan?    Started playing hockey the same year we got the Thrashers here in GA. Loved the sport, so when the Thrashers moved I wanted to support a ""local"" team. Was a choice between the Canes, Preds and the Bolts. in the 2012 season the Preds organization was very welcoming to us. They had ticket promotions and jersey trade-ins for us former Thrashers fans. Pair that with the structure of the organization (do more with less, focus on D more) and it was a no-brainer.    Whose jersey do you wear and why?    Josi. He's a franchise player (crosses fingers), who is very effective on both sides of the blue line. Got great smoothness to his style and we share a birthday.   What are your superstitions and why is everyone else crazy for not following them   None really crazy, I had a good run with drinking scotch during games, but then we hit the slump. So far though if I get Chinese takeout we win the next game. Its only got a sample size of 2 though."
Predators,33lqts,Wyntersun,2,Thu Apr 23 19:37:58 2015 UTC,"Was at that Caps game you linked to.  It wasn't reported on the national news but the Bridgestone arena actually exploded that night with 17K people inside.  No injuries amazingly, everyone just came out covered in yellow."

Predators,33lqts,Vaft,4,Thu Apr 23 22:06:42 2015 UTC,"My first game at Bridgestone came shortly after I got some bad news from my doctor (""precancerous"" tumor found, more tests needed, etc)...I booked a flight to Nashville for the last home game of the season because I wasn't sure if I'd ever be able to make it if I kept waiting.   This was two years ago, so we were doing pretty horrible. Coming off an eight-game losing streak and facing Calgary with a very experience Kiprusoff in net, I wasn't too optimistic about winning, but I wanted to be there to support anyway...and so did thousands of other Preds fans. Smashville cheered loud and proud for our boys, and just seeing and hearing it in person gave me the most wonderful chills. We got the W (Halischuk got the Frosty goal) and I was so floored I just started crying.   Unfortunately, I ended up getting more bad news from my doctor (cancer spread everywhere, six months to live, etc), so I quit my job and focused on my bucket list goal (HA, get it? Goal) of seeing a game in every NHL arena. This season, I've visited ten arenas as a Preds fan (and two when the Preds weren't playing there, because I'm too scared to go to St Louis and Chicago as an away team fan), met lots of really awesome people--including all you Predditors (I finally joined after lurking quietly for a while), and outlived my oncologist's initial prognosis.   I'm hoping to move to Nashville before the start of next season so I can be a season ticket holder. It's crazy, yeah, but...why not?? Win or lose, I stand with our Preds because of what they do on and off the ice.  Also: thank you for starting this thread; it was really nice reliving some of my favorite memories and reading about everyone else's incredible experiences."
Predators,33muvc,conceptjames,3,Thu Apr 23 20:25:08 2015 UTC,"Try Bar None, since it's on cable and all that they should be able to get it and they have some big-ass TVs. They're pretty good about putting on hockey over there."

Blackhawks fans, remember to avoid Tequila Cowboy, who are openly and blatantly trying to bilk you out of your money. If you want to support Chicagoans, go to 312 Pizza and take a cheap uber. Or go get cheaper drinks at almost every other bar on Broadway."
Predators,33lf8o,auquf,13,Thu Apr 23 14:32:13 2015 UTC,"Whiskey Bent Saloon on lower Broadway has been playing a similar angle to make a quick buck when Chicago fans come to town -- flying Blackhawks flags in front of the bar on game nights. In fact they have a big post about it on the front of their facebook page right now.  Somebody ripped the flag down, and they made a big fuss complaining about it, saying ""they were just trying to promote the matchup and show that Chicago fans would be welcome too..."" Sorry but that's a load of baloney. In fact it's been a pattern of behavior -- as far back as a couple of seasons ago they had events catered sepcifically to Blackhawks fans, do you see a mention of Predators fans for this ""Blackhawks Pregame Party""? I don't condone tearing the flag down or taking someone else's property, but I sure as hell am gonna tell everyone who will listen not to patronize their bar, from now till kingdom come."

Predators,33lf8o,G_Daddy2014,7,Thu Apr 23 15:05:06 2015 UTC,It's the playoffs. Attendance won't be an issue.
Predators,33lf8o,iamkanyesouth,8,Thu Apr 23 15:18:08 2015 UTC,Well I have been seeing a whole bunch of people saying how the season's over and stuff. Which it's not. This team is very resilient.
Predators,33lf8o,Havoc1887,6,Thu Apr 23 15:26:41 2015 UTC,"I'm also a Sharks fan.  Does someone need to point out to the defeatists what happened last year in the playoffs? :'(  Yes the odds say coming back from down 3-1 are poor.  But it will happen almost every playoff year.  LA came back from the even worse 3-0 hole last year, and I believe the Rangers came back from being down 3-1 last year.  I can understand fans being realistic, but there's no need for the downers to be so fatalistic.  It's not over yet!"
Predators,33lf8o,G_Daddy2014,4,Thu Apr 23 17:23:35 2015 UTC,I completely forgot about LA!   But overall a very good point. I love hearing this stuff. It really isn't over. These two teams are clearly evenly matched as is. Possibly being back Fish and Weber? Do we lose in 3OT?
Predators,33lf8o,Havoc1887,3,Thu Apr 23 17:57:05 2015 UTC,"Injuries are a part of the playoffs.  The Preds are deep enough to survive it, though I like the odds better if Fisher and Weber were back and in good health.  The 2 multi-OT games show nicely why giving up is stupid.  With a little different luck, it would be the Preds up 3-1.  There is certainly an element of luck in coming back and winning the series, but the Preds have shown they have the talent if they can get the lucky bounces.  It'll be some more amazing hockey to watch either way."
Predators,33lf8o,tuxfile,3,Thu Apr 23 18:51:10 2015 UTC,I'm really excited for the game tonight. Its gonna be a blood bath.
Predators,33lf8o,Havoc1887,4,Thu Apr 23 18:55:49 2015 UTC,"Then they are not true fans in my opinion. Doesn't matter if the game is over you stay until the end and support your team. Same thing goes for the season....fight, yell, scream, drink, etc until the end."
Predators,33lf8o,tuxfile,4,Thu Apr 23 15:40:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly! This is my first year ever going to the playoffs (because I can finally afford it).  Now I have season tix to the next 2 years, regardless of how this year ends, it will be a great few years."
Predators,33lf8o,G_Daddy2014,5,Thu Apr 23 15:44:22 2015 UTC,I'll be screaming my lungs out and waving my game 2 towel until my arm hurts tonight from 328!

Predators,33ixyq,Propeller3,3,Wed Apr 22 22:49:31 2015 UTC,That makes sense. It's unfortunate we couldn't keep that up. I do have hopes for the next game in the playoffs. We gotta score on the backup eventually.

I'd say even without Weber and Fisher the odds of that aren't too bad.   Then maybe they both return and we take the game in Chicago.   Then it's tied up and we're coming home with momentum. Are the odds against us? Sure. Has history suggested that won't happen? Absolutely. But it has happened and it's totally doable.   All the stats suggest were the better team. We can and have played with these guys. They just know how to put the puck in the net and Darling is feeling confident. But if we can break him on home ice then I think we've got a horse, neigh, a gallant steed in this race."
Predators,33ht4m,KakunaUsedHarden,2,Wed Apr 22 18:16:06 2015 UTC,Has their been any word on Fisher or Weber?  Weren't we supposed to find out about Weber today?

Predators,33ht4m,beegeepee,9,Wed Apr 22 18:52:29 2015 UTC,"As per @EricEngels This series: Goals 13-13, Nash has more shots, better pp%, better PK% and less PIMs"
Predators,33ht4m,KakunaUsedHarden,-4,Wed Apr 22 18:57:06 2015 UTC,"What about puck control and scoring opportunities?    The games have been very close.  Definitely could have gone either way.  I think the difference has been primarily due to experience and luck.  The Blackhawks have had so many playoff OT games in the last 5 years that it doesn't really affect them.  They have so many players that have been there done that.  You can't teach experience.  The Predators remind of the Hawks about 3 or 4 years ago.  Ton of  great young talent, but haven't gained enough playoff experience to get over the hump.  The series certainly isn't over.  However, given the Hawks experience and how evenly matched the teams are it seems unlikely either team could win 3 straight.  I would expect the Hawks to win in 6.  If it goes to game 7 I would give the Preds a TINY edge due to momentum and home ice.    Edit:  I just found this:  http://www.nhl.com/ice/series.htm?season=20142015&series=f"
Predators,33ht4m,beegeepee,8,Wed Apr 22 19:22:37 2015 UTC,"Are you even serious right now? Do you think the OT in game one affected the predators? they had 17 shots on net, and would have won if it wasn't for the SPHL's darling of hockey.  Same could be said for last night's game, I don't think it really ""affected"" them any.  Basically, it comes down to two screen goals that Rinne didn't even see."
Predators,33ht4m,taelor,-10,Wed Apr 22 19:28:34 2015 UTC,"""Do you think the OT in game one affected the predators?""   Yes, it put them down 0-1 in the series.  They rebounded nicely in game 2, but instead of going into Chicago up 2-0 putting a ton of pressure on the Hawks to win the next 2, they went in tied 1-1 giving the Hawks home ice advantage.  I am not saying the Pred's can't handle OT, I am saying the Hawks have more experience winning high pressure games and thus it is less likely they will panic or get away from their game.  While the sample size is only 2 games, the Hawks are 2-0 in OT this post-season.   Number of Post-Season OT Games for the Blackhawks:  2013-2014: 7  2012-2013: 7  2011-2012: 5  2010-2011: 2  2009-2010: 4"

Predators,33ht4m,taelor,5,Wed Apr 22 20:56:16 2015 UTC,"lol, they also tout crawford as being good."
Predators,33ht4m,taelor,9,Wed Apr 22 19:26:19 2015 UTC,Predators fan here.  Crawford isn't bad.  He is a good goalie.  His name is on the Stanley Cup.  He played 4 bad periods.  That doesn't make him a bad goalie.  I was amazed when Quinville pulled him.
Predators,33ht4m,iamkanyesouth,5,Wed Apr 22 19:33:14 2015 UTC,Crawford is average. The defense shat the bed in front of him and he has no confidence right now. They tightened up when Darling went in and he's stupid hot right now.
Predators,33ht4m,tuxfile,-8,Wed Apr 22 19:44:29 2015 UTC,"Right, even with Crawford playing like crap, the Hawks are up 3-1.    Darling has been lights out.  If he comes back to earth, it isn't unreasonable to expect Crawford to step up his game.  I don't consider Crawford elite, but he definitely is a top 10 goaltender when he is playing his normal game.  The Predators have shook his confidence that is for sure.  Yet, they still haven't been able to break the Hawks."

Preds win at home 5-3. Game 6 is another overtime with the Preds finally putting it all together and win it in regulation 3-2.

Predators,33g4bx,mmartinutk,6,Wed Apr 22 06:24:21 2015 UTC,"Yep. This team has no edge on Chicago. First two wins were largely thanks to Crawford. We can slow them down but we absolutely cannot get it to the front of the net.  What sucks is that one or two lucky bounces, and this series is easily 3-1 in our favor. Preds have played their damndest, save for a few too many breathers, but I just don't think it's enough to best Chicago."

I want to be happy that we have the opportunity to turn it around at home on Thursday night. I also want to be happy that we've made it this far.   However, this is not the case.   When is it time, as Preds fans, to say ""maybe a first round thumping ISN'T okay, even though we played them close""?   Happiness was 2 months ago, when we knew what we were doing.

Predators,33g4bx,zellthemedic,7,Wed Apr 22 19:54:49 2015 UTC,"Fucking disappointed we lost, but that was a hell of a game, especially considering Nashville's recent track record of shitting the bed in the 2nd. It's a very long shot that they could pull off 3 wins to advance, but really if they brought the game they did tonight each time, with just a little more, they could honestly have a shot at winning."
Predators,33g4bx,covinous,8,Wed Apr 22 06:23:55 2015 UTC,"They didn't shit the bed in the 2nd, because they were holding the shitting part until the 3rd period. Preds haven't played a straight full 60 minutes of hockey since the all-star break.  Except game 2 I guess."
Predators,33g4bx,zellthemedic,2,Wed Apr 22 06:24:53 2015 UTC,"How do you figure they shit the bed in the 3rd? They had two great penalty kills and Chicago only scored once instead of dumping it on like the other day. At any point in the last 45 minutes either team could have won. It just happened to not be Nashville. You have the right to be salty, because we lost, but I think you're being unfair to the team."
Predators,33g4bx,yupyupyuppp,3,Wed Apr 22 06:28:12 2015 UTC,"Did you watch the last 10 minutes of the 3rd? They were doing nothing. They took a knee. That goal Chicago scored would've been completely preventable. He had OPEN ICE and a damn near wide open net. You can't have that against a team like Chicago. Either one of those alone is bad enough, but both is a 100% guaranteed goal."
Predators,33g4bx,webersbeard,6,Wed Apr 22 06:31:07 2015 UTC,"agreed. Bitch about the result, but I can't bitch about the performance."
Predators,33g4bx,alexkendig,2,Wed Apr 22 06:29:44 2015 UTC,"You honestly think they played a full 20 in the 3rd? Those last 10 minutes were painfully bad. Even the 102.5 postgame, who are generally very generous to this team, had to mention that we let off the gas too much in the 3rd.  Chicago has outplayed us at some point in every game, except Game 2 when they had no chance with Crawford Sucks in net. It's very disappointing to watch Chicago go full throttle when it matters most."
Predators,33g4bx,Way_She_Goes,7,Wed Apr 22 06:57:53 2015 UTC,The passing in this game was atrocious.  Fucking a.
Predators,33g4bx,Bout5beers,7,Wed Apr 22 06:31:12 2015 UTC,Well the good news is we get an update on whats wrong with Weber later today. So we have the possibility of two heart breaking losses and hearing terrible news about our captain all within a span of less than 24 hours. Preds know tons about perseverance eh?  Scratch that: Games not Wednesday its Thursday. NyQuil. Not even once.

Predators,33g4bx,WHBK,9,Wed Apr 22 06:25:05 2015 UTC,"3 in a row sounds tough, I know. But you guys realize (IIRC) that Chicago has only had a lead in regulation in Game 3? I know they won 1, 3, and 4, but we have led or been tied in regulation the whole serious. This is not even close to being over.   The last thing this team needs is Smashville to not be Smashville.  Can't win 3 in a row without winning a game, can't win a game without winning a period. WE GOT THIS.  Edit: words"
Predators,33g4bx,alexkendig,12,Wed Apr 22 07:07:21 2015 UTC,Both sides played their lungs out. No cheap play either side. GG preds.  Rinne and Darling were amazing.

Predators,33g4bx,WHBK,10,Wed Apr 22 15:38:06 2015 UTC,Pekka needs a goaltending coach for that blocker side.
Predators,33g4bx,zellthemedic,9,Wed Apr 22 06:19:46 2015 UTC,"I fucking love Pekka Rinne. We couldn't get it done tonight, but he reminded us why he is the best goalie in the league."
Predators,33g4bx,_Guinness,1 point,Wed Apr 22 06:29:22 2015 UTC,Best goalie in the league doesn't get beat top right over and over and over and over and over and over again. That is the only place the Blackhawks are aiming now.
Predators,33g4bx,Wyntersun,12,Wed Apr 22 15:37:26 2015 UTC,"Well, way to continue the trend of disappointing us since the all-star break guys. I'm salty as ever-living fuck right now. Fuck Chicago, fuck Chelsea Dagger, fuck their stupid little horn, fuck these refs, fuck everything. This was the 'turning point' game in the series and they lost. No way we're winning this now."
Predators,33g4bx,righteousloaf,4,Wed Apr 22 06:23:21 2015 UTC,"Fuck Chicago,   :( well even if you hate our city we'd still love to have you. Its an awesomely beautiful place in the summer"

Predators,33g4bx,ShamefulMaple,3,Wed Apr 22 06:39:28 2015 UTC,"Anyone have possession stats for the OT periods? Because my gut feels like it was around 60-40 Chicago. We looked tired, and it felt like we were playing for the intermission breaks.   It's hard to believe that we can win 3 straight against this team. Yet there's always hope. Go Preds"
Predators,33g4bx,molby9,3,Wed Apr 22 06:59:20 2015 UTC,I seriously feel depressive. Either of those OT games could have gone either way and the hockey gods just didn't favor us.

Predators,33g4bx,BlueLineMenace,2,Wed Apr 22 06:34:51 2015 UTC,"Soo, we didn't we play Fiala more last night? He didn't seem to play that bad in regulation. Is he just too inexperienced? Why scratch Beck only to use Fiala for 11 mins? Isn't that kinda a live by the sword, die by the sword situation?"
Predators,33g4bx,WHBK,2,Wed Apr 22 13:03:48 2015 UTC,"We definitely should have. He was well rested when everyone else was gassed. It would have been risky, but I think it would have been worth it."

Predators,33g4bx,Harbinger147,4,Wed Apr 22 16:47:49 2015 UTC,What we can't have a calm discussion about the game with the fans of our opponents?

Predators,33g4bx,TRone33,2,Wed Apr 22 17:32:35 2015 UTC,"I think the feeling of some fans is that a teams sub is their quiet place to discuss, celebrate, and bitch amongst themselves. This is a Preds page for Preds fans. It's not against the rules for visitors, but it's easy to think that you have /r/Hawks and /r/Hockey to discuss stuff, why do you need /r/Predators too?  Not saying that opinion is wrong or right, just playing devils advocate."
Predators,33g4bx,c3ndre,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:38:42 2015 UTC,"i like to have a contrast of opinion on the game, I enjoy discussing the game with my teams fans, but also enjoy see how the other team viewed the game from there perspective"

Predators,33g4bx,4th_Line_Duster,0,Wed Apr 22 16:49:33 2015 UTC,Sorry if I offend. I actually like the Preds and the only time I ever root against them is if they play Chicago.  Plus I'll be moving to Nashville in less than 2 weeks.  It's a great city despite what some assholes from our fanbase like to say. There's plenty of hockey left and we're in your barn next. Good luck tomorrow

Predators,33ct2c,wrxie,7,Tue Apr 21 14:57:08 2015 UTC,"It would be rude if you didn't, /u/wrxie"
Predators,33ct2c,wrxie,8,Tue Apr 21 15:03:47 2015 UTC,I'll let him know this when I hang out with him. Any hat trick by Wilson requires my presence.
Predators,33ct2c,pardy,8,Tue Apr 21 15:21:08 2015 UTC,"Tell him we all say, ""Hey"" and make sure you print a picture of your flair. He'll love it."
Predators,33ct2c,iamkanyesouth,7,Tue Apr 21 15:22:58 2015 UTC,"God, I should print that and just take it to the game next time."
Predators,33ct2c,notheebie,7,Tue Apr 21 15:25:27 2015 UTC,"I'm actually surprised no one here has put it on the glass. That would definitely make a broadcast, too.f  Get on it /r/predators people that actually live in Nashville metro!"
Predators,33ct2c,greatbawlsofire,3,Tue Apr 21 15:30:01 2015 UTC,I wonder if he knows it exists. I'm sure he does.
Predators,33ct2c,righteousloaf,5,Tue Apr 21 15:31:34 2015 UTC,He's probably a lurker. Fuckin' Wilson...
Predators,33ct2c,j-awesome,17,Tue Apr 21 15:33:16 2015 UTC,"This game. Let us win this one game in Chicago, hockey gods. It will right so many wrongs. Please let Patrick Kane imbibe in one too many Goose Islands from last night. We can win this series and probably a Western Conference final appearance...but this is the game."
Predators,33ct2c,jackattack615,8,Tue Apr 21 14:27:12 2015 UTC,Was he out drinking?  Mmm reminds me of this time when a playoff team was in Phoenix and too many drinks were had.
Predators,33ct2c,HotChicken69,8,Tue Apr 21 15:45:38 2015 UTC,Just thinking about that makes me get grumpy.
Predators,33ct2c,iamkanyesouth,3,Tue Apr 21 15:53:29 2015 UTC,It doesn't make you /u/Grumpyyy ?  I'm sorry. It was there...
Predators,33ct2c,iamkanyesouth,13,Tue Apr 21 22:27:48 2015 UTC,Right back to October-December
Predators,33ct2c,iamkanyesouth,6,Tue Apr 21 14:38:28 2015 UTC,Someone had to bring it back
Predators,33ct2c,iamkanyesouth,4,Tue Apr 21 16:35:36 2015 UTC,/u/j-awesome and /u/KakunaUsedHarden have been pretty good at posting it too. I can't take credit for bringing it back.
Predators,33ct2c,notheebie,5,Tue Apr 21 17:00:28 2015 UTC,Love you....
Predators,33ct2c,HotChicken69,3,Tue Apr 21 17:09:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks, bae"
Predators,33ct2c,notheebie,3,Tue Apr 21 17:50:21 2015 UTC,upvotes all around for this.
Predators,33ct2c,befree1231,4,Tue Apr 21 17:14:42 2015 UTC,That song puts me in such a good mood.
Predators,33ct2c,KakunaUsedHarden,13,Tue Apr 21 16:47:28 2015 UTC,I have a feeling we're going to see one of the most physical and intense games of hockey this round tonight.  Both teams know that this game in particular has huge ramifications.  It isn't a must win.  We are in this series until the final second of a game four loss.  However winning this game will definitely make the remaining games easier to watch.
Predators,33ct2c,befree1231,12,Tue Apr 21 15:17:10 2015 UTC,This is definitely a must-win game.
Predators,33ct2c,woodfinx,7,Tue Apr 21 15:20:05 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong.  I want to win this game.  I want to see a stunned United Center.  I want to win in front of their crowd.  What I intended was that even if we do lose we are not out.  More difficult to come back?  Yes.  But this thing isn't over until it's over.  If I had my way we would win tonight in Chicago, then again in Nashville.  I want them to end the Blackhawks season in the united center.  I want to kill the king in his court.  Their fans act like they're hockey royalty.  I want them to know they're not invincible."
Predators,33ct2c,molby9,6,Tue Apr 21 15:30:54 2015 UTC,"Obviously everyone that bleeds gold wants to win this game because it means the series is 2-2 going back to a rabid Bridgestone crowd.  Sure the series isn't over until someone has four wins, but even going into Bridgestone 3-1, to win 3 in a row is a tall task. However, going in 2-2 with a raucous crowd could easily give us a 3-2 advantage going back to the UC."
Predators,33ct2c,predpilot85,3,Tue Apr 21 15:32:51 2015 UTC,Agree on all accounts.  Now thoughts on burning effigies of Blackhawk players at the plaza party?  A football tradition in some places to make a hockey crossover?  Hahaha.
Predators,33ct2c,woodfinx,8,Tue Apr 21 15:42:40 2015 UTC,"Haha we already have the homecoming car, but I feel like burning a player in effigy might come across as condoning violence, which I cannot do."
Predators,33ct2c,predpilot85,5,Tue Apr 21 15:47:31 2015 UTC,When our college did it for homecoming game it felt a little like that so I can totally see that.  However I still attended and drank beer and laughed.  So my convictions are not that strong.  Ugh I want to see our guys get under Hossa's skin again.  He got so angry about Stalberg last game!
Predators,33ct2c,woodfinx,10,Tue Apr 21 15:50:27 2015 UTC,Just sent a request to show up 2 hours late to work tomorrow. Late game and beer coming my way :D
Predators,33ct2c,dimwell,3,Tue Apr 21 14:15:15 2015 UTC,"Did you tell them it was because of the Preds? If so, mad props...and cool bosses."

Predators,33ct2c,Vataro,1 point,Tue Apr 21 14:51:19 2015 UTC,Nashville to VA. Made it with an hour and a half to spare.
Predators,33ct2c,thehollowhands,12,Wed Apr 22 01:47:55 2015 UTC,Memphians...heading to Brookhaven to watch the game. Be there or don't be there.
Predators,33ct2c,Vataro,9,Tue Apr 21 15:59:38 2015 UTC,Seems like a reasonable request.
Predators,33ct2c,thehollowhands,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:40:44 2015 UTC,"I have a migraine so I'll be trying to watch at home. I told the husband to head to Brookhaven after work because there will be others there, but not sure if he will."

Predators,33ct2c,mcnewcp,12,Wed Apr 22 05:23:34 2015 UTC,Get traffic in front of the crease. Elevate every shot. Stay out of the box.
Predators,33ct2c,yupyupyuppp,7,Tue Apr 21 18:08:44 2015 UTC,Add: Put more pucks in our goal than the Blackhawks
Predators,33ct2c,calebisstupid,3,Tue Apr 21 18:14:55 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean, but I read this as us putting pucks past Peks. I don't want that... and I don't think you want that either."
Predators,33ct2c,HotChicken69,3,Tue Apr 21 21:28:29 2015 UTC,Own goals. Own goals everywhere.
Predators,33ct2c,calebisstupid,10,Tue Apr 21 21:29:57 2015 UTC,C'mon boys. Let's. Do. This.
Predators,33ct2c,auquf,10,Tue Apr 21 14:43:08 2015 UTC,"Does anyone know if there are any official viewing parties for this?  Brewhouse South used to do the 303 menu, and it was always fun, but I have not found anything online about viewing parties recently.  (I did go to the bww one Sunday because they advertised it at the game Friday)  EDIT: So I noticed cellblock 303 posted a watch list for the Sunday game on their twitter. I'll keep an eye out on that."

Predators,33ct2c,Borovy3488,3,Tue Apr 21 15:21:20 2015 UTC,Cheap draft beer. Average food. Lots of tvs.
Predators,33ct2c,notheebie,3,Tue Apr 21 21:15:30 2015 UTC,That's what I'm expecting! Hopefully they have a good selection of local beers.
Predators,33ct2c,Bocheetus,3,Tue Apr 21 21:17:53 2015 UTC,"From what I recall they did. Parking is in the back in a garage. Just FYI. If you don't like it there, just head to SAMs. Cajun pizza! Cheers"
Predators,33ct2c,tcorts,3,Tue Apr 21 21:23:31 2015 UTC,"I live like 2 blocks away, so will just be walking. Expecting Sams to be even more packed, but I agree 100% on the cajun pepperoni pizza. SO GOOOOD, especially with tabasco."

Predators,33ct2c,woodfinx,5,Tue Apr 21 15:44:23 2015 UTC,BWW was good. It was packed Sunday and every Budlight that was purchased came with a raffle ticket for a Weber signed jersey or preds tickets to game 5.  The only big issue is that Budlights are $5 or something because BWW is extremely pricey :-(
Predators,33ct2c,matt5605,3,Tue Apr 21 16:10:58 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty awesome promo, but yea, BWW is ridiculous. I don't remember that last time I went to one."
Predators,33ct2c,woodfinx,3,Tue Apr 21 16:45:33 2015 UTC,"A quick follow-up, the BWW in Cool Springs is not doing an official party tonight, but they ""think"" that the Smyrna location is.  I'm still looking for a Cool Springs place. Brewhouse will be my choice if I do not find an official place."
Predators,33ct2c,SantiagoRamon,3,Tue Apr 21 21:25:53 2015 UTC,The deal with Brewhouse expired at the end of last season when Gover went pro. I haven't seen anything about an official team watch party yet.

Predators,33ct2c,burgerboy5753,9,Tue Apr 21 23:40:02 2015 UTC,"When Nashville has hustled and been very physical they seem to dominate Chicago. They let up on both of those half way through game 3. If they can keep it physical and clog up the neutral zone, I think they have a good shot. Peks needs to be on his A game too."
Predators,33ct2c,G_Daddy2014,7,Tue Apr 21 17:18:25 2015 UTC,"I am beginning to think that Jones will be the most pivotal player in this game. When he controls the puck, he is dangerous."
Predators,33ct2c,Wyntersun,4,Tue Apr 21 17:33:16 2015 UTC,"True but when he leaves drop passes or soft passes in front of our net he is dangerous to us.  I can't wait for him to turn into Josi.  I think he will, but I can't wait to see it.  Like literally can't wait, as in I want him to be as good as Josi right fucking now.  Not at game time tonight I mean at this exact moment."
Predators,33ct2c,Oddsock1701,3,Tue Apr 21 18:33:28 2015 UTC,"Like fucking game 3.  But that's exactly what I mean about puck control...those neutral zone turnovers suck, like bad."
Predators,33ct2c,e39,10,Tue Apr 21 18:46:24 2015 UTC,Ive been real proud of the way Franson has stepped it up. Sure he's had a few hiccups but since being scratched he seems to not look as lost. (I never imagined me saying this...)
Predators,33ct2c,Wyntersun,8,Tue Apr 21 18:01:54 2015 UTC,He hasn't looked lost unless he thinks the Blackhawks were offsides haha
Predators,33ct2c,e39,8,Tue Apr 21 18:27:40 2015 UTC,"Okay Preds, tonight is your night. Tie this up and show you're better than the Hawks. THIS IS YOUR TIME.  I'd love to see you all in the second round!"
Predators,33ct2c,Wyntersun,5,Tue Apr 21 20:55:22 2015 UTC,Hitting the gym after work to relieve some stress before coming home to dinner and the game. It's going to be one hell of a game that's for sure and the boys need to come out firing and play a full 60+ minutes.
Predators,33ct2c,WeirdLastName,9,Tue Apr 21 15:42:04 2015 UTC,This is going to be one physical game.  I can't wait to see Hossa get all pissy again after Stalberg hits him again.
Predators,33ct2c,Clainhart3,3,Tue Apr 21 15:47:30 2015 UTC,That was freaking great haha. I saw him making the run at Willy after that exchange and was kind of worried.
Predators,33ct2c,TweetsInCommentsBot,7,Tue Apr 21 15:57:34 2015 UTC,We will come out with a fire we have yet to see from this team.  We will be heavy on the forecheck and we will win.

Predators,339gju,alexkendig,11,Mon Apr 20 18:37:44 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's just Rinne, the team itself hasn't been working well in the past few games (aside game two)  I think Rinne is good, but the losses have been increased by the ineffectiveness of the team in general. Last game against Chicago was an example. Without Weber it is showing but regardless they need to all step up.  Overall I don't think its Mitch Korn being absent, but a team wide issue that's causing the problem"
Predators,339gju,Oddsock1701,8,Mon Apr 20 18:45:58 2015 UTC,I think we may have burned up Pekka by not giving him games off
Predators,339gju,j-awesome,4,Mon Apr 20 19:05:48 2015 UTC,Was thinking this too. But compared to other playoff team's Rinne isn't the highest.  Bishop - 62 GPs   Fleury - 64 GPs   Rinne - 64 GPs   Price - 66 GPs   Holtby 7fucking3 GPs  Lundqvist would have been on the list if not for his injury. Dubnyk was a barnfire for the first four month but if you look at his post February work load it's impressive.   Now if he was rocking an injury than that's a different story. But looking purely at wear and tear - yes he's in the higher end - but no it's not a surreal amount.
Predators,339gju,KakunaUsedHarden,2,Mon Apr 20 19:41:04 2015 UTC,Well he was leasing the league in starts before his injury. The injury may have been a side effect of over work. By then it may have been too late.
Predators,339gju,j-awesome,3,Mon Apr 20 20:01:08 2015 UTC,I still say Hutton should have played some more.
Predators,339gju,wrxie,6,Mon Apr 20 19:29:10 2015 UTC,"Yup, or if they didnt trust him they should have found a backup they did."
Predators,339gju,j-awesome,4,Mon Apr 20 19:30:23 2015 UTC,Exactly. You can't be good if you never play ... He should have been used.

Predators,339gju,wrxie,1 point,Tue Apr 21 03:21:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Hutton needs games to be good, which we've seen each time he's been forced to take over for Rinne during injury. Shaky to start but really comes into a groove later on.   Sadly....a backup, especially one behind someone like Rinne who plays nonstop, needs to be the type to come in a situation cold and play well. I think Hutton would shine in a system like the Blue's right now, where there's no set starter."
Predators,339gju,mrbelsoon,6,Tue Apr 21 11:34:00 2015 UTC,"I've said this before on a few other commenters. I think he rushed back from the knee injury. I think his competitive drive led him to come back sooner than needed. I would almost guarantee that at the end of the year we are going to hear about an injury that he played through similar to the hip injury at the end of the lockout season.  He is still playing decently, he just hasn't looked as sharp since that Canucks game."
Predators,339gju,AmericanSatellite9,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:38:03 2015 UTC,that's exactly what I'm thinking. I would not be surprised at all if I hear about him getting surgery post playoffs
Predators,339gju,burgerboy5753,5,Tue Apr 21 01:43:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but Pekka has been flat out awful overall for a couple months now. Go to waronice.com and look at the goalie save-%'s broken down by shot difficulty. On ""medium-danger"" and ""high-danger"" shots, Pekka has been the worst/2nd worst starter in the entire league from the time he came back from injury. He has single-handedly cost us several games down the stretch. If he's been playing hurt, shame on the staff for rushing him back. If he's not, we might be in big trouble for the future. The only reason I'm not screaming for Pekka to be benched is because Carter is somehow worse in these same categories. Who would've ever thought goaltending would be our biggest problem? Sighhhhh"
Predators,339gju,bmiller1187,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:07:04 2015 UTC,"I kinda did.. Not because I knew Rinne would regress like this, but because if he got injured in the playoffs that's an immediate death sentence. So I was like halfway there"
Predators,339gju,LiterallyNotChicago,5,Tue Apr 21 01:42:00 2015 UTC,I still don't think he is 100% healthy.
Predators,339gju,Jonesey07,4,Mon Apr 20 19:11:01 2015 UTC,"I still see Pekka making those ""impekkable"" saves, but yeah, this year he seems to be letting in a few gimme goals.  He's still performing at a level above most of the others. I think we all might be a little spoiled at just how good he can really be, watching him 80 games a year. You get used to him making some ridiculous saves and they start to look like par for the course. Great goaltending is difficult to notice night after night if you're not used to a subpar performance.  I have no idea how position coaches influence their players. It seems to be like being just one year removed from Korn would have a minimal effect on Peks and Huts?"
Predators,339gju,yupyupyuppp,6,Mon Apr 20 19:03:04 2015 UTC,I'm more upset that our younger crop won't get a chance to learn under the yoda of goalie coaches.
Predators,339gju,AmericanSatellite9,2,Mon Apr 20 19:39:31 2015 UTC,"The short answer is, none of us fans know and the only way to find our for sure is to ask Rinne yourself. Speculation is fun and all but don't take anything of what people are saying as fact here. Anecdotal opinions and observations don't mean much.  That said, long answer is I think when Rinne came back from his knee injury he had fallen out of whatever groove he was in. Sometimes that shit just happens. When you're on a roll you gotta keep going as long as you can, and his knee injury gave him a hard reset. Now, if the problem is psychological or injury related, I don't know, but he definitely has not been the jedi in gold he was earlier this season. I'm under the impression it's all in his head, personally, but he seems to be slowly finding himself again. Problem is you're playing the Blackhawks in the playoffs. Not many goalies are going to ""play well"" against them, so it's not a fair assessment to go judge his playoff performance (unless there are goals which are just overwhelmingly soft). Arguments saying the team hasn't played well the last 3 games don't hold any value to me. They've played great, maybe not 100% 100% of the time, but the guys in front of him look like their old selves again."
Predators,339gju,LiterallyNotChicago,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:39:07 2015 UTC,"He's been average, and I think Chicago scouted him well, trying to go 5 hole, where he gets beat in shootouts, and staying away from his golden glove. The defense in front is still trying to adjust to Laviolette's fast break system, and it's obvious that we are struggling with getting the puck out of our zone. Cycling is killing us, and I think more hitting and less watching the puck/more head on a swivel from the defensemen would help a lot."
Predators,339gju,OCCUPY_BallsDeep,0,Tue Apr 21 14:17:45 2015 UTC,"Mitch wasn't a full time coach and at Pekka's stage, there's not much more ""coaching"" to be done. I think it's just a goalie with a lingering injury. Scott Darling doesn't have Mitch Korn anymore either and he's doing okay.."
Predators,339gju,auquf,3,Mon Apr 20 20:58:14 2015 UTC,So you're saying once you're good at something you don't need coaching anymore?  And Scott Darling never had Mitch Korn.
Predators,339gju,auquf,0,Mon Apr 20 21:07:14 2015 UTC,"No. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying once you're good at something you don't get bad at it because your coach leaves.  As for Scott Darling, he played 26 games in Milwaukee last season, so yes, he worked with Mitch Korn. In fact, Mitch Korn is the one that offered him the contract with Milwaukee."
Predators,339gju,justinbbradford,1 point,Mon Apr 20 21:43:57 2015 UTC,"Korn is the Predators goaltending coach so he doesn't spend much time in Milwaukee because he's in Nashville working with his goaltenders there. He works with his NHL guys daily. Doing drills, going over videos, and he's the first guy at their stall after a game. Plus there's not much benefit to working with a coach in a short period of time compared to working with him for years.  Also, I think we're going to agree to disagree about the about abilities changing after personal coach change. It happens a lot in tennis, golf, baseball etc.. If coaches didn't make a difference with players at that level, they wouldn't be needed. They wouldn't fire some and look for new ones."
Predators,339gju,tuxfile,3,Mon Apr 20 21:56:33 2015 UTC,"Goaltending coaches work with the goaltenders in the entire organization, not just on the NHL level."
Predators,339gju,TTUGoldFOX,0,Mon Apr 20 22:02:09 2015 UTC,Right but they spend most of their time with the NHL guys.
