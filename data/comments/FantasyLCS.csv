I don't know if WT will be playing this week for TSM though, after that atrocious Corki performance last week, so if he's out for 1 or 2 of the games you could definitely have an advantage there."

FantasyLCS,3e31za,Yordleboi,4,Tue Jul 21 16:04:09 2015 UTC,What are your thoughts on Giants? Should i start Pepii/Adryh?
FantasyLCS,3e31za,statiky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:12:25 2015 UTC,I see giants performing about average this week. You can see on the chart how I predict them to score. There are better picks.
FantasyLCS,3e31za,sidneycapri,3,Tue Jul 21 16:18:59 2015 UTC,Is it worth putting nukeduck in as s flex? My other options are vardags forgiven and fox
FantasyLCS,3e31za,sidneycapri,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:10:06 2015 UTC,"I think Nukeduck is your best option out of who you have listed. However, you can see from the chart I don't expect him to score very well."
FantasyLCS,3e31za,FreestyleKneepad,2,Tue Jul 21 16:17:09 2015 UTC,"Personally, would you play Huni or Hauntzer?"
FantasyLCS,3e31za,FreestyleKneepad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:25:44 2015 UTC,"Why not both? Who have you got in Flex?  I would say Huni is the safer pick but Hauntzer as the opportunity for higher points. If you need to win this week with lots of points, go with Hauntzer."
FantasyLCS,3e31za,FreestyleKneepad,2,Tue Jul 21 16:33:30 2015 UTC,As flex I was either going to play Altec or Doublelift. Do you think it would be worth subbing one out for Huni or Hauntzer?
FantasyLCS,3e31za,Case104,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:42:07 2015 UTC,"Hauntzer has actually been scoring better than or equal to Altec the past three weeks. I'd personally go Huni, Doublelift, and Hauntzer."
FantasyLCS,3e31za,SuperSexyDragon,2,Tue Jul 21 19:09:02 2015 UTC,"So I've got Soaz, Peke, and Mithy on Origen and Hauntzer, Keane, Bunny, and Team Gravity, and right now I'm starting Soaz, Peke, Bunny, and flexing Keane. I'm edgy about both OG v ROC (they lost last time around) and GV v TiP so I'm kinda hedging my bets with this. What're your thoughts there?"
FantasyLCS,3e31za,SuperSexyDragon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:28:41 2015 UTC,"I think you are going into a super risky roster that could backfire on you or pay off big. Unfortunately, there is no way to be sure.  Without knowing who else you have available I can't give you a full answer."
FantasyLCS,3e31za,FX_Wafflefoot,2,Tue Jul 21 16:36:54 2015 UTC,"Full roster is Soaz, Santorin, Xpeke, Rekkles, Bunny, Keane, Gravity  Bench is Adryh (figured he was a huuuuuuuge risk), Hauntzer, Mithy  Opponent has Huni, Amazing, PoE, Apollo, Adrian (assuming that'll change), Altec, H2K  Free agents worth mentioning are Werlyb, Cabochard, Xmithie, Nukeduck, Pepii, Fox, Betsy, MrRallez, Tabzz, Vardags, Aphromoo, Team Liquid  Appreciate the advice!"
FantasyLCS,3e31za,FX_Wafflefoot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:51:22 2015 UTC,The only change I would consider is Soaz > Hauntzer and Bunny > Aphromoo.  The reason I suggest this that Soaz has consistently been an average scoring top laner never playing the super carry top. Hauntzer meanwhile has been scoring above average. The change from Bunny to Aphro is to keep you from being too invested in Gravity.

FantasyLCS,3e31za,JasonBlows,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:36:33 2015 UTC,"I would go with CLG, Aphro, and Santorin."
FantasyLCS,3e31za,Ulsfart,2,Tue Jul 21 16:37:31 2015 UTC,"What would you suggest I do with my roster? http://gyazo.com/d6a792ddffedf0be9199a8ec8922a9a8  I really want to run peke, fenix, and turtle but I can only run 2 of them. I can also pick up the team CLG. Was thinking of running CLG instead of Liquid.   My opponent: http://gyazo.com/e56c5a2aab1a52b261683f8fd15bf753"
FantasyLCS,3e31za,baconnnnns,3,Tue Jul 21 16:44:11 2015 UTC,I would agree with running CLG over TL. Especially since your opponent has 2 CLG members.  I think keeping xPeke on the bench this week is the right call for you. OG has a rough matchup and I think the others you have will score better.  I want to talk about RO vs Rush in case anyone else reads this. RO's average week is about 39 points. Rush's average in a 1-1 week is about 42 points. So if TIP has a 1-1 week then /u/SuperSexyDragon will likely get more points with Rush.

FantasyLCS,3e31za,aXieEEE,2,Tue Jul 21 18:36:07 2015 UTC,Quas or Dyrus? XiaoWeiXiao or Adryh(GIA)?
FantasyLCS,3e31za,aXieEEE,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:37:17 2015 UTC,I would recommend Quas and XWX.
FantasyLCS,3e31za,FoozleBamboozle,2,Tue Jul 21 19:01:15 2015 UTC,"Hi Yordle, thanks in advance for your help.   In your chart, you have Keane getting more points than Pobelter, but I also got the sense that you're picking CLG players over Gravity players this week. Who would you advise picking between the two of them?   I also have the same issue with the following: Hauntzer vs Quas, Move vs Xmithie, Altec vs Wildturtle or Neils, Bunny vs Lustboy or Xpecial, GV vs. CLG"
FantasyLCS,3e31za,minida,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:39:07 2015 UTC,"In leagues where I have CLG players available, I'm still picking GV players other than Aphromoo and Doublelift. The other CLG members have not been scoring great lately.  I would personally go with Hauntzer, Xmithie, Altec, Bunny and CLG. If you need a flex I would pick WT over Niels.  This does put the team 3 members deep into GV. If you feel that's too much swap in Xpecial over Bunny.  I do think GV will go 2-0 but there is a chance of them losing a game to TIP."
FantasyLCS,3e31za,johntindlemen,2,Tue Jul 21 19:06:27 2015 UTC,Do you think all members from elements will score decently this week?
FantasyLCS,3e31za,mariosancez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:39:41 2015 UTC,The only member of EL I would pick is Froggen. I don't expect anything above average from them other than Froggen.
FantasyLCS,3e31za,mariosancez,2,Tue Jul 21 19:07:31 2015 UTC,I could use some help deciding who to use as my flex.  Right now I'm debating between Hjarnan and Quas.  I'm leaning towards Quas simply because I'm afraid of H2K tilting even further.  Any thoughts on who is the better flex this week?
FantasyLCS,3e31za,Eycd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:16 2015 UTC,If both go 1-1 Hjarnan will score about 42 and Quas will score about 37.  On a 2-0 week Hjarnan will score about 58 while Quas will score about 50.  So while Quas normally scores worse than Hjarnan if you think Quas will go 2-0 and Hjarnan 1-1 then go with Quas.
FantasyLCS,3e31za,TheADTRAffliction,2,Tue Jul 21 19:16:11 2015 UTC,Here is my Roster for the week. This game is for Frist pretty much.Anything i might need to change?   Match up: http://i.imgur.com/v6BVOT2.png?1                             Roster http://i.imgur.com/1Vs8GYJ.png
FantasyLCS,3e31za,TheADTRAffliction,2,Tue Jul 21 18:50:13 2015 UTC,I would switch to H2k over GIA for your team slot. H2k generally scores better.  Other than that I would not change a thing.
FantasyLCS,3e31za,Se7enthetics,2,Tue Jul 21 19:18:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for the help. Was very unsure of what to do with Top, dont much like Werlyb he has failed me twice now. And was unsure of Shipthur over Ninja"
FantasyLCS,3e31za,BarraCuda93,2,Tue Jul 21 19:20:26 2015 UTC,DIG vs NME should be good points for Shiphtur. The only reason I say to stick with him over Ninja was his great performance last week. If you don't think Shiphtur will do as well as he did last week then go with Ninja.  You could do with a better top laner but the fact that you have Werlyb probably means that there is no one in the free agent pool better.
FantasyLCS,3e31za,BarraCuda93,2,Tue Jul 21 19:32:16 2015 UTC,Yea free agent top is Gabochard steve jwawo and gamsu
FantasyLCS,3e31za,_S0MEDAY_,2,Tue Jul 21 19:39:06 2015 UTC,Gamsu might score better as he is against NME but it's a tossup between him and Werlyb who will do better.
FantasyLCS,3e31za,BigHero6Baymax,2,Tue Jul 21 19:46:41 2015 UTC,thought soo too. Will think on it maybe just roll the dice and pray ha. Thank you again
FantasyLCS,3e31za,MaestroCondatis,2,Wed Jul 22 00:23:20 2015 UTC,You're welcome and good luck!  I was thinking some more and looking at numbers. Ninja is looking better and better to me over Shiphtur. I'd personally make the switch if you need safe points as he scores better in a loss. Meanwhile Shiphtur has the higher potential so if you need lots of points to win he's probably a better bet.
FantasyLCS,3e31za,TheBoppy,2,Wed Jul 22 00:34:04 2015 UTC,quick question. Hope i can still get an answer if possible. What are your thoughts on Incarnation? Since Hai has came back he point avg actually has been going up. If this just cuz of the teams they have been playing or the result of Hai?
FantasyLCS,3e31za,FIR3_5TICK,2,Wed Jul 22 13:37:44 2015 UTC,C9 has been playing better with Hai on the team and everyone's average has gone up. I expect the team to get good points against TDK. About 20+ each. But I don't expect them to do well against TSM.
FantasyLCS,3e31za,ongolroosor,2,Wed Jul 22 14:33:54 2015 UTC,What are your thoughts on CW after beating H2K? Should I start Freeze over Adryh for flex?
FantasyLCS,3e31za,Mosesmania,2,Tue Jul 21 18:52:44 2015 UTC,I'd personally go with Adryh as he's a safer pick. However Freeze has the capacity for higher points so if you need to be risky to win this week Freeze might be the better pick.
FantasyLCS,3e31za,CaptainComebacks,2,Tue Jul 21 19:20:27 2015 UTC,"Any ideas?  http://i.imgur.com/gcfABQy.png  Lost last week by 0.5 points, worst feeling haha.  Everyone on my bench scored more than their counterparts!  Was an awkward week though."

FantasyLCS,3e31za,BTrill92,2,Tue Jul 21 19:38:04 2015 UTC,Do you do a recap for your season fantasy predictions at the end of the year?  What has been your surprise for the year if you have to think to all the way back to pre-season/week 1? (Guessing Hauntzer but there might be something else)  Otherwise good luck on getting the prediction contest will pm you again soon!
FantasyLCS,3e31za,Kazugaya69,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:03:58 2015 UTC,I tried to do a recap once but it was heavily downvoted. It might go better now since I have more people in my posts.  Hauntzer did better than expected but was not a surprise. I had him as the fifth best TOP on my draft list.   My biggest surprises would have to be SK and GMB. I expected both to do great this split.
FantasyLCS,3e31za,cobblerino,2,Tue Jul 21 19:27:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah the downfalls for teams this year were very hard, especially the Gambit with one of the top point getters from last split.

FantasyLCS,3e31za,Tryft,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:26:46 2015 UTC,I don't know. I think a big draw is people need confirmation on decisions or needing some help. I'll think about it. Maybe a post about my drafting strategy would go better. I'm sure everyone will forget by spring split!

FantasyLCS,3e42cm,h2hhombre,2,Tue Jul 21 20:11:41 2015 UTC,Nice artlice liked it. Question tho if you mind answering. What do you think of Gamsu and Cabo this week?
FantasyLCS,3e42cm,Xosanj,2,Wed Jul 22 13:25:37 2015 UTC,"Hmmm if I have to pick one over the other. I always like Cabo, but Gamsu has been more consistent from a week to week basis. I don't think Dig will beat CLG so Gamsu might not get points in that matchup but will probably perform well against NME. And Cabo plays elements and H2K. So both guys have one tougher matchup and one easier one. I think I would give Gamsu the slight edge this week, but Gambit has more upside in my opinion!"

FantasyLCS,3e3l14,Kammikaze18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:42:28 2015 UTC,1) Pick one: Gamsu/Rush/Ryu/CoreJJ (Ninja and Emporer are free agents)  2) Pick two: xPeke/Pepiinero/Hjarnan (Incarnation is a free agent)
FantasyLCS,3e3l14,Hawkingbird,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:15:13 2015 UTC,"xPeke and Incarnati0n.   OG should be able to exploit H2K's weakness as they've been exposed in their slump.  Incarnati0n because this week is all or nothing for C9.  In the standings, they can best be 7th place, and they're fighting T8 for that. C9 is 5-11 while T8 is 6-10. If C9 wins both, and T8 loses both, they are going to have a chance for worlds. BUT if they go 1-1 and T8 goes 2-0. Good bye worlds. This means the veteran C9 members will give it their all as they have the experience.   Also, in their game vs CLG they had shown REALLY good team fighting, something TSM lacks. With Hai's shotcalling, C9 can out rotate and win teamfights vs TSM. TDK is just a free win by now."

FantasyLCS,3e3l14,SmoresChaos,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:16:55 2015 UTC,"Niels. H2K is in a slump, meaning that OG will easily be able to exploit their weakness. This means Ryu is out of the equation.  Apollo second simply because they have a superior team fighting to pretty much all the NA teams. TL depends on team fighting, so TIP likely to win. GV depends on cheese picks, and I'm certain TIP has their own. (i.e. yasuo)  Last is Pepii, cus Nien is trash. Look to trade away Ryu+Pepii for someone better."

FantasyLCS,3e3l14,TheUgliestWeenie,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:35:12 2015 UTC,If I were in your position I would go Xmithie and Fenix.

FantasyLCS,3e3l14,Delta_357,2,Wed Jul 22 16:28:46 2015 UTC,Tough choice. A lot of people are predicting C9 to have a good showing against TSM on their last match of the season. I am not one of these people so I believe Froggen will outscore Sneaky
FantasyLCS,3e3l14,hoangbody,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:22:13 2015 UTC,"I'll go with that, esp considering gamibt have just lost their adc, although i'm in the C9 camp rn"

FantasyLCS,3e3l14,XDragon5lay3rX,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:38:53 2015 UTC,"Sneaky is probably the safer of the C9 players. Points between him and Incarnation are very close, but he will have an easier time. If you think H2k will take the game against OG then go with Ryu, but he's certainly risky this week."
FantasyLCS,3e3l14,Kammikaze18,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:08:11 2015 UTC,Incarnati0n or Apollo? Thanks!
FantasyLCS,3e3l14,climber_g33k,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:19:37 2015 UTC,"Apollo. TIP players tend to scored pretty well even in losses and they even have a chance to win one or both games this week. Incarnation has a decent week, but he's up against 2 other solid mid laners. It's very possible that C9 2-0s this week, but I'm expecting them to go 1-1."
FantasyLCS,3e3l14,Kammikaze18,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:35:14 2015 UTC,"I think we are going to see C9 go 1-1, as well. Apollo has done me well all season, so I think I'll keep him on."

Apollo is probably the most risky pick, but TIP players tend to score decently well even in losses and there's still a chance they could take one or both games this week. Also, Fenix and Altec don't play each other this week so you wouldn't have that problem if you started them."
FantasyLCS,3e3l14,Kammikaze18,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:00:36 2015 UTC,"I need to pick two (one mid, one flex) between Xpeke, Fenix, and Apollo. I've pretty much decided I'm likely starting Niels over Apollo.  I'm also entertaining the idea of offering Apollo for Altec for this last week. Thoughts?"
FantasyLCS,3e3l14,Hafniso,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:07:12 2015 UTC,"Fenix for mid. Xpeke for flex if you think OG will beat H2k, otherwise Apollo. If you can get Altec (I would be surprised if you did) then flex him instead."

FantasyLCS,3e3l0s,NesuDesu,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:15:10 2015 UTC,"Looking CLG last week and their ability to actually come back plus their easier last two games (Should be) I'd go with Aphro, but not 100% sure on that"
FantasyLCS,3e3l0s,SAFFATLOL,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:00:02 2015 UTC,"Mithy is last of those three.  Aphro is the safer (and probably better) choice, but if it were my team I'd probably start bunny. I think Gravity will go 2-0 and score big points, but I seem to be in the minority in that one. If the Tip vs Gravity matchup scares you, definitely go with aphro."
FantasyLCS,3e3l0s,Hafniso,1 point,Wed Jul 22 16:47:56 2015 UTC,"Should I drop Mithy for Vander, Kiwi, Gate or even Lemon? I can drop Aphro for the same people in my other league."
FantasyLCS,3e3l0s,SAFFATLOL,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:58:33 2015 UTC,Mithy has a hard schedule this week but I like his and OG's chances at a strong finish to the split so if I were you I would keep Mithy in that league. I would definitely keep Aphro in your other league.
FantasyLCS,3e3l0s,hoangbody,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:39:36 2015 UTC,Lustboy or Mithy?

FantasyLCS,3e3l0s,FantaLCS,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:15:01 2015 UTC,Aphro. CLG has an easy week. Second choice would be Nyph because of their matchups. Mithy and Lemon are risky and nRated is just a no-no.
FantasyLCS,3e3l0s,Kammikaze18,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:08:34 2015 UTC,"Since Adrian is gone, should I drop him for Vander or put my faith in nRated? Gate would be available when added but he played poor against TDK."
FantasyLCS,3e3l0s,nihontiger,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:49:58 2015 UTC,"Gate, for sure. SK and Roccat are way too inconsistent. If they don't add Gate, go with Vander."

FantasyLCS,3e3l0s,Hafniso,1 point,Wed Jul 22 16:39:21 2015 UTC,Lemonnation is a decent bet. If you think you can predict the winner of H2k v OG you could go with one of those.
FantasyLCS,3e3kzs,LoLFantasyBot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:13:58 2015 UTC,"Rush or Reignover? Fnatic will probably win this week, however, they haven't been putting up a lot of points even in their wins the past couple weeks. But TIP does have a harder week."
FantasyLCS,3e3kzs,ZarythZ,2,Tue Jul 21 18:22:03 2015 UTC,"If you believe Rush and Team Impulse won't miss a step with Adrian gone and a new support, Rush will score more points than Reignover. I would go Reignover though as he is the safer pick imo and I really enjoy watching him and Fnatic play"
FantasyLCS,3e3kzs,hoangbody,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:15:24 2015 UTC,"Tip's schedule scares me away, especially with a new support. I would go the safer route on Reignover for this one."

FantasyLCS,3e3kzs,mattyice24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:42 2015 UTC,I would go amazing. I know Amazing has had a tough couple of weeks after going off at the start but I don't feel like H2k is quite as strong as before and I am hoping that OG beats them in their head to head on day one.
FantasyLCS,3e3kzs,hoangbody,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:16:39 2015 UTC,"Santorin, Xmithie, Porpoise8 or Meteos?"

FantasyLCS,3e3kzs,zevairia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:06:59 2015 UTC,You really have your pick of the litter here huh. Xmithie and CLG have great matchups this week. Move has a slightly harder schedule and Amazing definitely has the hardest out of the three. I would go Xmithie>Amazing>Move but I'm also a CLG fan.
FantasyLCS,3e3kzs,hoangbody,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:11:50 2015 UTC,Amazing or Santorin and Amazing vs Move

FantasyLCS,3e3kzs,Kammikaze18,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:48:16 2015 UTC,"I think I'd go with Hai, but it's definitely hard. I'm pretty 50-50 on who's going to win between the TSM vs C9 game. The thing that makes me like Hai better this week is the fact they play tdk. I think there's a good chance tdk plays in high point games this week since they have nothing to play for due to being auto-relegated. They already showed a peek last week they're picking comfort champs and playing a bit loose. That's just my two cents though."
FantasyLCS,3e3kzs,Hafniso,1 point,Wed Jul 22 16:59:56 2015 UTC,"I have Santorin and Amazing and I have a hard time deciding on which one to go with, I can trade either for Xmithie."
FantasyLCS,3e3kzs,BTrill92,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:48:05 2015 UTC,I would go with Xmithie. CLG has a pretty easy week and NME loves to give everybody points. Keep Santorin so someone else can't take him though.
FantasyLCS,3e3kzs,Kammikaze18,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:46:05 2015 UTC,"Reignover, Move, Dexter or Jankos and why?"
FantasyLCS,3e3kzs,FantaLCS,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:12:01 2015 UTC,"Move with RO as runner-up. Mostly because I believe in Gravity and I'm worried FNC will repeat week 8 with low points. Dexter would be third because Gambit should be weaker and SK loves to give up points, but EL could easily 2-0 or 0-2. Roccat is just too inconsistent for me."

FantasyLCS,3e3kzd,ZarythZ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:23:38 2015 UTC,"I'd go with Impact. TIP has been putting up decent numbers in losses and they certainly have a chance to take 1 or even both games this week. And like you said, Soaz hasn't been producing particularly well lately."

FantasyLCS,3e3kzd,t3h_Sober1,2,Tue Jul 21 18:54:52 2015 UTC,I would prefer Impact over dyrus. I know Dyrus has an easier matchups but Impact has been a consistent scorer with TiP looking to end the split strong
FantasyLCS,3e3kzd,hoangbody,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:09:29 2015 UTC,Odo or Visicsacsi?
FantasyLCS,3e3kzd,WillsGotDeals,3,Tue Jul 21 20:19:06 2015 UTC,I would go odo. UoL's unraveling the SK game really concerns me and they play against Fnatic on the second day.

FantasyLCS,3e3kzd,Kammikaze18,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:42:34 2015 UTC,Impact or Dyrus? Seems silly but TiP has a tougher week and I question if they'll be as strong without Adrian in their fights.
FantasyLCS,3e3kzd,nihontiger,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:55:30 2015 UTC,I question the same thing too on TiP not being the same without Adrian but I would prefer Impact over Dyrus. I know Dyrus has an easier matchups but Impact has been a consistent scorer with TiP looking to end the split strong
FantasyLCS,3e3kzd,hoangbody,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:40:03 2015 UTC,Impact. TIP players score well even in losses. TSM is too much of a wildcard at this point. They could 2-0 or 0-2 just as easily.

FantasyLCS,3e3kzd,thoainreborn14,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:02:01 2015 UTC,"If no one else is available, then go with whoever you think will take the win in their game. I personally would go with Odo because Soaz hasn't been getting that many points, but it's a very close call."
FantasyLCS,3e3kzd,Kammikaze18,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:06:26 2015 UTC,Huni or Hauntzers?
FantasyLCS,3e3kzd,MylesvS,1 point,Wed Jul 22 16:25:24 2015 UTC,"Both should get a good amount of points. Gravity's wins are less certain, but Hauntzer likely has a higher point ceiling. I'd go with Huni."

FantasyLCS,3e23pv,TheManDudeGuy,3,Tue Jul 21 10:52:12 2015 UTC,"TIP has the toughest week possible, but they are a solid team and both Rush and XWX are good enough even in losses and I don't see any obvious better options. I think Ninja and Emperor could have a good points week despite probably going 0-2 (See their game against TIP last week [except for Smoothie]), but that's certainly a risky play. If you're worried about TIP's matchups, start Keane and flex Adryh. Giants is up against CW and UoL this week and have a >0% of going 2-0.  Wildturtle is just fine. Either TSM does well, your opponent gets a bunch of points and you share in those points, or they do poorly you're affected a little bit and your opponent is affected a lot. It's always a good idea to try and match your opponent's team whenever possible. That way if one lcs team goes really big it's not an auto-win for either player.  CLG could pretty easily 2-0 this week. I'm starting them wherever possible.  I really don't like Dig this week. They are just too inconsistent.  If TSM doesn't do well this week or Fnatic does a repeat of last week (I really hope they don't), you pretty much just win."
FantasyLCS,3e23pv,Kammikaze18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:13:50 2015 UTC,"I think I'm going to stick with TiP for now, but I'm a little worried about Adryh. I don't want to put two GIA players in if they end up going 1-1 and get mediocre points. Would Nukeduck be a better pickup for that? Or maybe I should just stick with Keane to match my opponent's Altec?"
FantasyLCS,3e23pv,Kammikaze18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:53:34 2015 UTC,"I would trust both Keane and Adryh more than Nukeduck at this point. Roccat is just too inconsistent imo. Or maybe I'm just bitter about week 4. If I were to bet on any of the available players I would pick either Ninja or Corejj, but I'm not sure if I like either of them more than Adryh.  I've changed my mind about Dig, partially. If you're worried about swapping out XWX for Adryh and having 2 Giants players, consider also swapping Werlyb and Gamsu. Dig's  first game is against CLG which could be 1 sided in CLG's favor, but might not, but their second game is against NME who just love to give up points. Werlyb is one of the most inconsistent players I've seen (ranging from 11 to 63 ppw this split."
FantasyLCS,3e23pv,Kammikaze18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:04:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah thats another thing that frightens me about Werlyb. I dont exactly have enough faith in dig to do well though, as it seems as if the old dig is back in their slump"
FantasyLCS,3e23pv,Xosanj,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:01:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, beating Gravity and then getting crushed by TSM made for a very interesting week. Still, I would bet more on Gamsu than Werlyb."
FantasyLCS,3e23pv,WooshJ,2,Wed Jul 22 02:57:14 2015 UTC,Need to put that Adryh in. Tho not sure how UOL and GG will go but any team that plays the Wolves is gonna get free points. Im not sure about werlyb myself. Got him in my team too but looking up hes score line he does terrible even in wins most he has ever scored in a win is like 15 or 16 points on week.
FantasyLCS,3e23pv,WooshJ,0,Tue Jul 21 12:11:16 2015 UTC,"Should I put him in instead of Keane? And if so, should I put keane in for xwx? TiP has a tough schedule this week, but they have a good potential to go 2-0 and score a lot of points, so I'm afraid to not put xwx in."
FantasyLCS,3e23pv,Kammikaze18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:17:46 2015 UTC,"i dont think TSM is a good pick right now so having turtle might not be the best option..

FantasyLCS,3dw589,FirstOne617,2,Mon Jul 20 01:34:12 2015 UTC,"Don't be so spoiled because Fnatic didn't hard carry you this week. Huni, Febiven, Yellowstar, and Fnatic Team are all still #1 in their roles. Reignover is 4th and Rekkles is 3rd.   Winning games consistently is the best quality a fantasy player can have. Play any Fnatic members you have"
FantasyLCS,3dw589,Anders157,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:37:00 2015 UTC,"Definitely an outlier. Are they scoring less points than last year because they are finishing games quicker? Yes, but their more tame point output is still pretty high considering they just keep wining. You won't get 4 points from a Fnatic player because their team got handled. Week 8 was screwed up even harder by Huni's Riven, that got so strong it basically made their opponent concede everything until it would have lost them the game.  Huni is still #1ppg for Top.  Reignover is #4ppg for Jungle.  Febiven is #1ppg for Mid.  Rekkles is #4ppg for ADC.  Yellowstar is #1ppg for Support.  Fnatic is #1ppg for Team.  You are better served by taking the solid, consistent points than taking a gamble on a big splash."

FantasyLCS,3dw589,FDSariku,0,Mon Jul 20 06:01:05 2015 UTC,"Sure !  To begin with every points earned is divided by the lenght of the game, we only use pts/min.  As far as player goes :  Kill +200, death -200, assists +100,creeps +1, triple +200, quadra +500, penta +1000. You add all this together and divide it by the lenght of the game.  For teams : Victory +300, defeat -300, nashor +150, dragon +75, turret +75, first blood +150. And same thing here you divide by the lenght of the game.  This system rewards good teams and good players instead of bad teams who are unable to close a game and fight for 50 minutes."

Another guy in my league got so screwed with the Wildturtle thing and also meteos leaving (he doesnt check the league as much as the rest of us).   I picked up Keith in case he ended up getting switched in to replace turtle for a full weekend. Was definitely a mistake because I ended up without any very strong ADCs on my team.

FantasyLCS,3dny3x,doneitnow,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:20:03 2015 UTC,Are you being serious right now?   Huni is #1 top laner in points per game  Reignover is #5 jungler in ppg  Febiven is #2 mid laner in ppg (basically tied with Bjerg for 1st)  Rekkles is #4 adc in ppg (and he is in a tier above the other adcs ppg wise)  Yellowstar is #1 support in ppg  Fnatic as a team is #1 in ppg by a pretty good margin (about 3 points a game more than any other team)
FantasyLCS,3dny3x,winSight,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:14:22 2015 UTC,But that's because they win every game. Show me points per win.
FantasyLCS,3dny3x,BlizWizz,2,Sat Jul 18 18:30:29 2015 UTC,"Points per win is only worth something under 3 conditions: 1. You can actually predict with good certainty if they will win 2. They actually win often enough to be worthwhile (winrate >= ~50%) 3. You have the free roster space to swap out if you don't think they'll win  Take ROC this season, great points per win. They lost games vs really good teams early in the season, and coming off of the win vs OG they looked rock solid? Wrong, you lose both games next week. Most EU teams aside from H2K, OG and FNC were pretty damn finicky this season.  But let's pretend I can tell when ROC wins, and when they lose, with 100% accuracy. ROC is currently 7-9 and has only 2-0'ed 1 week out of the past 8. So if I am counting on points per win, guess what? I can play my ROC player 1 week. Great!  Which goes to the last point. What the hell is the point of keeping a player who is good for 1 week on my roster? Riot limits to 10 players in a roster and 2 of each position. That gives me 3 bench spots to hold backups and potential sleepers, and now I got to make room for a guy who I KNOW will only be good for a week? No thanks.  Anyhow,  I'm not saying points per win is useless, but you certainly cannot argue against FNC this year just bc they had a low week off of a 2-0 just off of points per win."
FantasyLCS,3dny3x,doneitnow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:27:04 2015 UTC,Fine look at last splits data where they still topped the position charts in points. Whatever man don't draft Fnatic I'm sure people in your league like that.
FantasyLCS,3dny3x,BlizWizz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:39:43 2015 UTC,"But that was last split, I'm talking about this split.   Last split they weren't nearly as good and therefore their games were much bloodier.   And yeah, I'm getting rekt by all the people with Fnatic, those sub-15 points per game for this week, the pain is real."
FantasyLCS,3dny3x,BlizWizz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:47:17 2015 UTC,"I can see your logic because they play ""cleaner"" games, but all you have to do is compare them to spring split cloud 9 from this year. Cloud 9 was dominant too and still didn't score a ton of points in wins. This Fnatic is dominant and they are still putting up high numbers in their wins (which are all decently clean for the most part)."
FantasyLCS,3dny3x,doneitnow,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:09:10 2015 UTC,And their stats right now are all points per win because they are better at the game how can you fault them for that

FantasyLCS,3dmpap,dms51585,2,Fri Jul 17 15:14:17 2015 UTC,"I know that most gambling sites pick it up, and my group of friends to a personal pool (our own rules), but I am not aware of a website that handles World's for fantasy.  I'm sure that some might (Alphadraft; Vulcan; etc...), but the entire format of it would have to change, likely. So it goes a bit against how their websites function.  Make a list of the sites you would use, and keep track of them 1-2 weeks leading into worlds.  I'm really hoping that Riot picks up the concept for world's, but it won't be for this year. They need to open up the general fantasy pool to the other regions before they can really implement that. The truth is, the average viewer has no idea who foreign players are outside of Faker. It makes me question why they would watch MSI due to that, but in any case, until the general public is given access to the 'ability' to choose the regions for their fantasy, or it's simply automatically included in the entire pool, I don't see Riot implementing any form of world's fantasy pooling."
FantasyLCS,3dmpap,Republic_of_D,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:16:02 2015 UTC,that's too bad. After they included all regions on lolesports.com there is hope that there will be fantasyLCS for all regions and worlds later maybe.   Thx for you answer!
FantasyLCS,3dmpap,Republic_of_D,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:20:54 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm with you. I hope they include all regions.

FantasyLCS,3djs4k,Shozo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:03:06 2015 UTC,"I'm on the fence for this one.   On one hand, I understand the frustration of playing very well, scoring the most in the league, but being placed at the bottom instead of the top. You've played well, but you aren't rewarded. This happened to me on the very first split of FLCS where I was in a 4-man league and finished with only 2 victories (both wins when I was 1st on the week, 1 loss when I was 3rd that week, and the rest of the losses were when I was 2nd) and placed last despite outscoring everyone else by rather significant amount of points.  But on the other hand, I also understand that what matters is simply whether you score more than your current opponent, and not whether you accumulate more points in total. So the concept of victory and defeat is not based on your performance. But it's more to do with your opponent's performance because it's somewhat irrelevant whether you score 200 points or 400 points, you don't win or lose because of that."

FantasyLCS,3dhzfs,HeisenbergisWW,3,Thu Jul 16 12:46:57 2015 UTC,"I think you will be just fine, though I would consider swapping Hjarnan for Fenix. Liquid has looked quite good lately while H2k has been slumping. Though having 297 estimated points is fun. :P  What junglers are available? Nvm, just learned how to read. I would go with Rush or Amazing if either of them are still available."
FantasyLCS,3dhzfs,Kammikaze18,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:27:55 2015 UTC,This is a good week for h2k but in the last few weeks Fenix has been scoring 55+ points so I really don't know what to do. I want to read others' opinions before making a clear choice but thanks ;)
FantasyLCS,3dhzfs,Kammikaze18,3,Thu Jul 16 13:36:49 2015 UTC,"Sure thing. I also want to point out that Loulex has only scored 46+ points once this split in week 3 which was, interestingly, against SK and Gambit. His average for the split is 15.87ppg putting him in 11th overall. Meanwhile, Rush is the top jungler at 22.64 and Amazing is 5th at 20.23.  I don't think the decision between Fenix and Hjarnan is terribly important as I expect them both to produce good points, but Fenix seems like the safer option. I'm expecting Giants to put up a really good fight and possibly even take the game. They were the closest of any team to beating Fnatic after all."
FantasyLCS,3dhzfs,HomicidalHeffalump,2,Thu Jul 16 13:43:27 2015 UTC,The Odo vs Hauntzer call is tough. I'd stick with Hauntzer though.

I would personally play Keane as they have a much easier matchup this week (Dig and T8) than CLG (TL and C9, and I predict both TL and C9 to pull it together this week).  FNC and OG are likely to go huge this week so luckily you have an even share of players from these teams.  Ultimately it's going to come down to TIP - if they go big this week you will probably lose, but if you play Keane and GV go big, you will easily win."
FantasyLCS,3dgmdv,Pwn5t4r13,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:42:22 2015 UTC,Xmithie and Zion are my other two.  No free agents I'd play over DL or Keane.

I feel it's akin to Link's tell-all letter. Xpecial and Richard Lewis touched on this type of behavior when they responded to the Link issue. It's professional suicide. If a member of a team, in dispute, chooses to refuse to play (in collusion with other players on the team), they're essentially bowing out of professional LoL.  This split has been a roller-coaster ride, but if SK did forfeit their games, I would be very surprised. I wouldn't start altering my roster of FNC or OG just for that possibility, though people should keep their ear to the ground on LoL news for any advantages it provides.  But a forfeit... that I would like to see."

FantasyLCS,3ddse8,hoochmen,6,Wed Jul 15 17:17:12 2015 UTC,Dam i heard n Rated was having issues with the team but I didnt realize it was at THIS point. Looks like sk is gonna have ANOTHER revamp roster. Time for Fox to make his best Yellowstar impression and rebuild
FantasyLCS,3ddse8,plafiff,2,Wed Jul 15 14:32:38 2015 UTC,Seems like it's the players having problems with the organization. Not 100% sure as there hasn't really been an official statement
FantasyLCS,3ddse8,chase2020,4,Wed Jul 15 17:45:14 2015 UTC,Don't play any of their players.
FantasyLCS,3ddse8,chase2020,8,Wed Jul 15 14:29:19 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's pretty obvious not to play any SK players, but what about the teams they're supposed to play against? Origen plays them on friday this week and Fnatic next thursday. If SK forfeits their games then Origen and Fnatic only have 1 game in the respective week from which they will get points."
FantasyLCS,3ddse8,coldhandz,2,Wed Jul 15 14:44:17 2015 UTC,Forfits would surprise me. I expect games against them will be low point games. Usually when a team goes through something like this they start to play reactivity rather than making plays themselves. I expect them to just kind of slowly let the game slip away from them because they are afraid to fight.  Or we get a sub squad and they go yoloqueue
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,Yordleboi,4,Tue Jul 14 16:05:10 2015 UTC,Thanks for your post! This week seemed extra doubtful for me because of TSM's recent slump but this gives me some good info for how to proceed.

FantasyLCS,3d9miu,plafiff,3,Tue Jul 14 16:26:40 2015 UTC,I saw a post stating that Gilius would be playing in Kikis' spot.
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,plafiff,3,Tue Jul 14 17:19:20 2015 UTC,"Did some research. It looks like UOL tweeted that it would be Gilius then deleted the tweet.   Since he played with the team before I expect the team dynamic to be good. I don't think he will be as good as Kikis was, but I don't think he will hold back the team.   I'd bet on UOL still going 2-0."
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,Xionix34,2,Tue Jul 14 17:34:17 2015 UTC,Yah I was trying to find the source but saw it deleted. So guess we are still unsure lol.   EDIT: new UoL Facebook post confirming Gilius as jungle for week 7 with Airwaks and Hor0 as substitutes
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,HomicidalHeffalump,3,Tue Jul 14 17:58:37 2015 UTC,Who should I put up for this week?  I'm iffy on putting in TIP members since they're against TSM.  But Rush when he wins does get more points thant Loulex.  My Roster: http://imgur.com/1nuHmmJ Match up: http://imgur.com/KJkY362
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,Xionix34,2,Wed Jul 15 14:55:05 2015 UTC,"Playing TSM as your team would be what has me most worried. They should go at least 1-1, but TIP could easily take their game. If you're not in an 8 man league (judging by your star studded roster, I'd guess not) there should be another team available that would be more reliable this week. Similarly you should also be able to find someone next week the same way(GIA?), since we are coming down the home stretch of the season."
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,HomicidalHeffalump,2,Wed Jul 15 15:45:53 2015 UTC,"in a 6 man league, and the only team worth picking up is TIP."
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,yeshtables,2,Wed Jul 15 16:39:31 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. Rush performs well even in losses most of the time, plus something crazy could always happen with H2K this week. If it was me, I'd diversify to Rush over Loulex and leave TSM on the team slot if there really are no other teams you think will go 2-0 this week available."
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,yeshtables,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:40:33 2015 UTC,I believe TIP will beat TSM and think you should play Rush over Loulex and Apollo over Keane.  If you disagree or are still unsure then I think you should keep your roster as is.
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,yeshtables,2,Wed Jul 15 15:43:02 2015 UTC,"Hmm, should I put Pepiinero, Goldenglue or Ninja mid this week?"
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,yeshtables,3,Tue Jul 14 16:31:37 2015 UTC,I had to make this same decision in one of my leagues. I went with Goldenglue. Going against TDK is the best way to get points right now.
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,FoozleBamboozle,2,Tue Jul 14 16:33:46 2015 UTC,"Awesome thanks! One more question for you: for flex I have the option of putting in Vardags, Vizi, Adrian or Dyrus. In order to get Vizi though, I'd have to drop Dyrus, because I currently have both him and Quas. Do you think it's would be worth it to risk Dyrus getting picked up by someone else?"
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,Crashflyaway,2,Tue Jul 14 16:37:13 2015 UTC,"I think you should play Vardags. I expect him to perform similarly to Vizi and it lets you keep Dyrus.  Plus, on the off chance UOL do lose a game, the ADC tends to score the best."
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,goldenpinapple,2,Tue Jul 14 16:44:00 2015 UTC,"Good logic haha, thanks :D"
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,goldenpinapple,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:46:14 2015 UTC,Glad to help!
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,AssSandwich,2,Tue Jul 14 16:49:15 2015 UTC,Do you think Adrian would be a better pickup than Vardags for flex? He's going up against TDK and might go 2-0 this week.
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,Smurffffsssss,2,Thu Jul 16 13:28:24 2015 UTC,"If you believe that TIP will beat TSM, then I do think this would be worth more points."
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,Smurffffsssss,2,Thu Jul 16 14:41:17 2015 UTC,"Hey man, should I start Bjergsen or Fenix in MID? Also, I have access to 3 good ADC's in Doublelift, Apollo, and Altec, but only the 2 slots to put them in, ADC and Flex. Which 2 should I choose?"
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,Smurffffsssss,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:49:52 2015 UTC,"I definitely think Fenix will do better this week. Out of the three, I would choose Apollo and Altec.   However, Doublelift should have a great week 9. If you are afraid of someone else picking up Doublelift, then he should score similarly to Altec."
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,Smurffffsssss,2,Tue Jul 14 17:02:21 2015 UTC,"Would you play kasing or adrian this week?  I feel like putting kasing in because they're playing CW, but TIP games are usually more bloody, and with TSM in a slump, I'm not sure who to run."
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,BTrill92,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:01:44 2015 UTC,It depends on your match up.   Do you need safe points? Go with Kasing.   Do you need to go all out in order to win? Go with Adrian.
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,Wazousky,2,Tue Jul 14 17:06:54 2015 UTC,"adrian vs niels on flex? silly question, but adrian has been consistently outscoring neils   adrian vs xepcial"
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,Wazousky,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:54:13 2015 UTC,"That first call is super rough. Adrian has outscored Niels the last few weeks. But Niels has only had one 2-0 week recently. If you go back to weeks 1&2 Niels scored amazing.    I'm going to assume that both the decisions are for the same roster, if not please correct me. Why not go with both? Niels flex, Adrian support?"
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,Wazousky,2,Tue Jul 14 18:54:52 2015 UTC,Hmm I already have Apollo as adc which is why either niels or adrian  also what you think between adrian/xpecial? thankss
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,kwevli,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:00:34 2015 UTC,"I would definitely pick Adrian over Xpecial, but that's because I predict TIP to go 2-0. If you're not sure then Xpecial will score very well too."
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,kwevli,2,Tue Jul 14 19:18:08 2015 UTC,"You also predict TL to go 2-0, though. And isn't TL more likely to beat CLG than TiP is to beat TSM?"
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,kwevli,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:30:01 2015 UTC,It's Risk vs Reward. Adrian is Riskier but should Reward more points. If you don't trust TIP then Xpecial is a great safe choice.
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,kwevli,2,Tue Jul 14 19:32:43 2015 UTC,"How is my roster looking this week? Any suggestions?  Move,XWX, Zion, Quas, IWD are also open"

I was 4th/5th pick so i managed to get febiven and rekkles and somehow yellowstar and reignover were still up when it was my turn to pick again. Couldn't get huni though :(

FantasyLCS,3d9miu,captainbiggles,2,Wed Jul 15 10:41:47 2015 UTC,I would recommend that you do not make the trade. Going from Move to Helios you will lose about 40 points over this week and next. Going from Sneaky to Altec you will gain about 25 points.  With a 15 point net loss I don't think this trade is worth it.

FantasyLCS,3d9miu,LeglessStallion,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:05:30 2015 UTC,"For the first roster, I'd switch in Rush for Jungle if you agree that TIP will beat TSM. This will get you some of the great points your opponent will be getting. I'd also consider either Fenix or Piglet in over Hjarnan as NA has been outscoring EU lately.  For the second roster, I'd consider Vizi over Odoamne. Vizi has outscored Odo every week for the past three weeks."

My opponent doesn't have any of either team, so playing for that doesn't bug me as much.  The other question is in regards to junglers. I'm starting Santorin, and my opponent has 2 TSM members (Lust/Team), and the only junglers left are Xmithie, Trashy, Porpoise, Frederic, and the bottom-tier team junglers that are all gonna get trashed. Not sure if I should keep Santorin or try something else (I'd go Xmithie but my opponent has Doublelift).  Thanks for all your help man!"
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,CaptainComebacks,3,Tue Jul 14 19:19:26 2015 UTC,"I'd go with Hauntzer, xPeke, and Bunny.  I think you are okay sticking with Santorin since your opponent has 2 TSM. TSM wins, you get good points. TSM loses and your opponent loses more than you do."

FantasyLCS,3d9miu,Mosesmania,2,Tue Jul 14 19:31:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks again for doing these, they are fantastic.  I don't think I have a tough week this week, my team is pretty good. There is 1 judgement call though I'm unsure of.  Most of his point getters are on the same team as players I have, though I'd like to think I mostly come out ahead should their teams do well. I don't have faith in TSM to do well so I think Rush will do fine pointswise although Amazing certainly should impress.  TLDR: Amazing or Rush? Is it worth hedging against XWX or Mithy/OG?

FantasyLCS,3d9miu,Mosesmania,2,Tue Jul 14 19:51:11 2015 UTC,"That's a super tough call. I expect Rush to do better than Amazing but your matchup in this case might override that as you have mentioned.   I've honestly spent about 10 minutes looking over data just for this decision now. I think you should trust Rush to get more points.   However, if your gut tells you to go with Amazing over Rush, going with Amazing is also a strong viable choice."

Luckily i am playing against someone who has quas in top lane and Pobelter as flex. Should i leave it how it is or replace fenix with ryu? last question: Move or Amazing? got Altec as my flex already.  thanks!

FantasyLCS,3d9miu,disturbedman,2,Tue Jul 14 20:49:25 2015 UTC,My only weak spot is the support. Aphromo or Hylissang?
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,HomicidalHeffalump,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:52:59 2015 UTC,I suggest Hylissang. He has the better chance of scoring more points.
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,BreakingLimit1,2,Tue Jul 14 20:58:45 2015 UTC,How about Hylissang vs Mithy? Flip flop schedule :)
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,goldenpinapple,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:45:30 2015 UTC,I'd stick with Hylissang. Mithy hasn't been scoring the best lately.  However Mithy is much safer points if you think UOL might throw a game.
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,HomicidalHeffalump,2,Thu Jul 16 14:47:19 2015 UTC,"My gut says UOL won't throw, and Mithy has been hit or miss.     BTW - I have Hauntzer and Vizi, Move and Keane. I'm starting Hauntzer, Amazing, xPeke, Hylissang. Deciding Flex is a nightmare. Thoughts?"
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,HomicidalHeffalump,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:17:51 2015 UTC,"So choose a flex between Vizi and Keane?  Tough call as I expect them to score similarly.

FantasyLCS,3d9miu,dbaldwin1993,2,Thu Jul 16 15:40:00 2015 UTC,"Hi Yordle, thanks for helping me with last week! I had a pretty convincing win http://i.imgur.com/moExcG8.png.   Now here is my matchup for this week http://i.imgur.com/psARHej.png and my roster http://i.imgur.com/nJ5VLjK.png. I am playing against the first place guy for second place.   For top lane, I have between Viscisaci or I can pick up Soaz from one of my friends.  For jungle, I can start amazing or reignover (my friend is holding him for me).   For mid and ad, I have to pick 3 out of the 4: xPeke, Febiven, Hjarnan, or Piglet and bench 1 of them and I don't know which one.  My opponent has 2 tip members so I don't know if I should start Adrian in case TiP goes big (although personally I think tsm will beat tip).  Also, I'm stacking OG pretty heavily and I know they got good points in the early weeks but I've heard that recently they've been really volatile and especially Soaz and Mithy are toxic so I don't know if it's worth the investment.  Sorry for the long post, thanks so much!"
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,IHeardTheredBeCake,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:12:48 2015 UTC,"Grats on your win last week! Also, a long post is fine, I love helping everyone out.  Top: Stick with Vizi. Soaz has too many ups and downs to be trusted. Question: If you think TSM is going 2-0, why not Dyrus?  Jungler: Time to get Reignover back. I think he's a much safer play than Amazing.  Mid/ADC/Flex: Leaving xPeke on the bench is the correct call.  Adrian: If you feel TIP loses that's a fine call. Kasing is a great support and should score well. I'd personally run Adrian because he has a higher point ceiling. Also, if you have one TIP and he as two. if TIP wins, they score big and you get a part of those points. If TIP loses, he loses twice and you lose once (although supports tend to get the short draw on a loss.)"
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,IHeardTheredBeCake,2,Tue Jul 14 21:25:27 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling TSM will prep extra hard for TiP after their 0-2 week because they usually work really hard after they lose and show up.  And I know Fnatic > H2K/OG but I feel like the games this week will just be short games with absolute stomps and since Fnatic plays objectives so well, the laners will get kills and snowball and end before reignover can get big points. Unless they make a mistake early like last week or draw out the game, I don't think Febiven or Reignover will get 10+ kills/assists.   And UoL has new jungler so Vizi might be more risky? At the same time, Dyrus usually gets big points off his wins from getting 10+ assists."
FantasyLCS,3d9miu,TheMagykal,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:42:47 2015 UTC,"You make some very good points. All we can do is speculate and hope everyone shows up and plays well.   I agree with your reasoning on FNC/OG. Going with Amazing vs RO is tough and either could do well. Amazing hasn't scored lower than a 42 on a 2-0 week while RO's lowest is a 34. I think the main problem with OG's week is going against SK. With nRated likely being replaced and the team in shambles, I expect everyone to just roll over them and not score very well.  As for Vizi vs Dyrus. Vizi is a risk due to the new jungler. If you feel Dyrus or Soaz will do better, then go for it!"

FantasyLCS,3d9miu,Voltex49,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:11:34 2015 UTC,"Rekkles and Fenix for sure. The hard call is Altec vs xPeke. You can see on my ranking chart I have them both at 49 and some change. It's going to be close.  The average week for xPeke with two wins is about 44.66. The average week for Altec with two wins is about 43.  Last time Altec went against these two teams he scored a total of 50. Last time xPeke went against these two teams he got a total of 67. However, SK is going to be a lot weaker this week and I expect that too be lower.  Out of the last 7 weeks, Altec has outscored xPeke 5 of the 7.  I honestly expect both Altec and xPeke to do worse than I have predicted. The teams they are going against are weaker now than when they first played them.  It's a tough call and I can't make this one for you. You've got a bunch of information right there now and I hope you can make a decision from that. If not, go with your gut."

FantasyLCS,3dcdqm,Talressen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:15:18 2015 UTC,POE or Keane?Fufu or Kasing?
FantasyLCS,3dcdqm,jian1312,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:30:49 2015 UTC,"Keane is a much safer pick, likely to go 40-50; PoE is risker, but can reach 60+.  Same with Kasing/Fufu. Fufu is guaranteed 40+, but Kasing could go 50+. There's less to gain by playing a non-safe support as they tend to do a standard 40-50 on 2-0's. So I feel that I can safely recommend Fufu there."
FantasyLCS,3dato1,Psyballa,2,Tue Jul 14 20:59:10 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's good as is. If you have an easy week ahead of you, I'd say start Odoamne. Impact is medium risk, high reward, whereas Odo is low risk, medium reward."

FantasyLCS,3d8ah0,FUZZB0X,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:41:36 2015 UTC,"My exact thoughts - I actually just dropped the risky Wildturtle in favor of Emperor today - if he can pull in 19+ points a game when they're losing, I'd imagine he'll manage something solid once the team gels with their new lineup. Seems like a safer bet than Turtle anyway, and in our 8-man league the available ADCs are super gutted."

If Piglet or Hjarnan are available, pick them up as quickly as possible.  If you're willing to take a risk, Apollo might be a good pickup if you're willing to take a risk.

I was a bit worried about hypetraining on Gravity from the get-go, and then Candypanda went and shat the bed. Fortunately, my opponent's team played itself, so I skated by on a few trades that didn't go his way. I got lucky, though- if he'd had Rekkles and I'd had Reignover, I would have lost.  That puts me at 6-1, leading the league. Of course, my opponent literally has not changed his roster since the draft, and wins because he faces... the guy who hypetrained so hard on Dignitas that he benched Team Fnatic. http://i.imgur.com/bZKxoaf.jpg  I'm playing him next week, hopefully Doublelift doesn't get another goddamn 70 point week to carry this guy who probably hasn't even looked at this website since the draft."

FantasyLCS,3d2w8o,flydigh,5,Mon Jul 13 02:23:27 2015 UTC,"Get Huni. It worked. Alternatively, get Yellowstar. That also worked. Secondary was H2k which worked out pretty well. I drafted C9 and Gambit too high. I have 0 TSM members in any of my 8 leagues and no regrets. Picking up Origen after week 1 was big too."
FantasyLCS,3d2w8o,Kammikaze18,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:37:33 2015 UTC,"Going in I knew everyone else in my league would prioritize ADCs and mids, but I knew both of those roles are pretty stacked right now. So I valued Huni and Yellowstar as #1 and #2 just like you did since they're in a tier of their own for their respective roles. Then I knew I could still probably get a tier 2 mid and maybe a tier 2-3 ADC.   Got Huni first round, yellowstar second, xpeke 3rd, niels 4th, fenix 5th. So yeah I ended up pretty stacked :D. 2nd in my league right now but I have highest points scored, I think I have a good shot at taking first by the end."
FantasyLCS,3d2w8o,iambatmon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:53:38 2015 UTC,both [ADC and mid] are pretty stacked right now.   This is the most important thing to consider in the early rounds when drafting LCS. Huni and Yellowstar are just so far above the rest of the players in their respective positions with a significant drop off to 2nd best and another significant drop off after the top 3 or 4 while ADC and Mid have a much smaller drop off between the top 6 or so. #1 top + #5 mid >>>> #1 mid + #5 top.
FantasyLCS,3d2w8o,Kammikaze18,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:07:06 2015 UTC,"I had the same exact idea and first 3 picks as you, but then had WT and jumped on the EL train with Tabzz, and got screwed on my jg. I'm 4-2 now because I quit trying to pick up players who had easy weeks for cheap points (cough Roccat cough)"
FantasyLCS,3d2w8o,FlyPengwin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:36:58 2015 UTC,"Same with me. The differential between Huni and the next 4 best Top laners was huge, and same for Yellowstar. I couldn't believe I got Huni as a 3rd pick - he would have been my first pick regardless, and getting the still-open Yellowstar in our 8-man league on the way back around was also astonishing to me!  Granted I did suffer a bit in my ADC and Mid slots, but I've been able to sub in/out those slots week to week based on matchups and the mid-tier team hits and misses throughout the season. 1st place by a win going into last 2 weeks!"
FantasyLCS,3d2w8o,CanORage,2,Tue Jul 14 22:49:13 2015 UTC,"My strategy is to always start with those who have already proven themselves as good scorers in their current roster (current roster is key, compare Forg1ven last split to Forg1ven this split).  However, always leave room for the up-and-comers.  This strategy worked out pretty well for me, I ended up getting Huni, Hjarnan and Quas, but left room for those who I thought could be big.  After Origen went huge in week one, I picked up Amazing.  Once Gravity began to rise, I picked up Altec."
FantasyLCS,3d2w8o,johntindlemen,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:43:57 2015 UTC,"Ignoring mid really worked out. Could get some fantastic picks like Pobelter, xPeke, Keane, and Fenix really late for varying reasons. Always picked 2 solid mids, and haven't had any reason to not use as flex.  Obviously pinching Yellowstar or Huni supplements this strategy and wasn't a hard decision if they were open."
FantasyLCS,3d2w8o,pwndnoob,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:35:53 2015 UTC,"Incarnati0n hype failed me. Nothing was the same after. I tried saving my draft by picking up any remaining players in the following weeks for the important mid lane role, but only very high-risk high-reward players remained, like Nukeduck, Shiphtur, and Froggen, but they always fall in points to the opponent's strong mid laner regardless."
FantasyLCS,3d2w8o,Toriyosh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:12:28 2015 UTC,"Value in the biggest position that you can get. Got first pick for the 2 drafts I did, Febiven/Huni were my aims, Had a weak Jungler/ADC or Flex coming out the draft process (Having a weak jungler/adc is always bad less bad places better you should be in the long run). Had some trades help me possibly win one in one league (Apollo for sneaky) and will aim for 2nd in another.  Also my team name is called Bird's 2nd Place team cause a team will probably get 2nd if not both of them. (My teams last split got all 2nd.)"
FantasyLCS,3d2w8o,l3ird,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:55:23 2015 UTC,"So I joined three different leagues this split. In my first one, the BDC brotherhood I actually have a shot at getting 1st in one (I think I'm currently tied for second, but I also gave 1st place, which was 6-0, their first defeat, so that makes me feel rather good). All I can say about this group is that I drafted Fnatic and Febiven, knowing that the best team in EU, with a worldclass mid laner, was probably going to score me points. I remember the last time I played Fantasy LCS I was annoyed how teams with 3 or 4 players from the #1 or #2 team in the league would often just outscore everyone because teams that win more tend to get more points. So Yeah, I did that. I also got Doublelift and Aphromoo and apparently they're like super good at getting LCS points, but during the CLG dive I swapped Aphro for Bunny Fufu. My only weakness here is jungle, because I have xsmithie. But I mean, he's the best available right now.   In my second Fantasy league, Super Group, I'm tied for 6th/7th, but at least last place hasn't won yet, which makes me feel rather good about not being last. (Actually it looks like last place isn't even playing; they not only drafted youngbuck, but started him this week, along with soren, and that's pretty much the ONLY reason they lost). In super group, I got Power of Evil, hoping that UOL would succeed and post some nice results. Sadly, he also hasn't done that good. Of course, this week, he gets 71 points sitting on my bench because, for some stupid reason, I decided to pick up Betsy (I think I'm far too much of a Gambit fan for my own good). I think other than that, I've had a lot of bad luck. I have Move, Quas, and Altec, who all post good to average stats, but that just hasn't converted to wins.   In my other, GGWP, I am again in 2nd last place, however, its not nearly as clear cut, and I could actually end up in last place. Funnily enough, that's the only group I have an IRL friend, and that friend is the one who's currently in last place. In GGWP I gambled pretty heavily on Gambit getting their shit together, and that kinda fucked me. I drafted Forgiven and Betsy when I probably should have gotten cabo instead, especially since I currently am struggling along with Steve and Oddamne (who I picked up far too late). I also took a big gamble with Incarnation, who had shockingly average to horrible scores. Ryu, Loulex, and Oddamne were my saving graces, but that also can backfire if H2K is facing Fnatic or something."
FantasyLCS,3d2w8o,toastymow,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:26:03 2015 UTC,"I just picked players who are solid performers on their team but not super stars for the most part. Xpeke > ReignOver > Apollo > Altec > Aphromoo > Odoamne > CLG. I'm 3-3 due to some unfortunate weeks with CLG, H2K, and Origen. Overall it's going to pay off as I'm looking to finish 5-3 as I picked up team GV for CLG mid split.   [edit] my league is also highly competitive with 4 people tied for third at 3-3, one person 5-1 and one person 4-2."
FantasyLCS,3d2w8o,r3cluse,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:39:53 2015 UTC,"My team changes alot every week.  I tried a new strat this year:  0) This may not be possible but grab the unusual point scorers for Top/Support:  kaSing/YellowStar or Huni/Impact.  Wasn't able to get any of these they were picked up really fast and I wast last in the 8-team snake pick.  1) Get a strong jungler or top who isn't afraid to engage (Amazing, IWDominate, Reignover, Rush /  Huni, Quas, Hauntzer, Impact) I got Quas and Amazing.  2) Look at the individual lane matchups and judge which ones will win majority of match-ups versus the top 4 teams from last split.  I grabbed Febiven for my first pick.  3)  Mid and AD get traded the most during weeks 1-4 then they pretty much stop being traded after that so make sure you get the stronger starting ADs and MIDS you want as soon as possible as most points come from Mid/AD.    See above, I actually did something risky and went with Forgiven and Freeze first then swapped them both out after week 2.  4) Pick your Team or Support last.  (unless you got KaSing or Yellowstar.. Adrian is actually doing well fantasy points wise but Team Impact has considered dropping him already)  After I got my first 5 picks, I grabbed TSM.  I actually dropped TSM for Gravity in week 6 because both TSM and Dignitas already played all of the 'easy' teams this half of the split.  General rule goes if you don't think a player can score more than 30 points in the week after assessing the lane match up, and previous week's Team performance, then don't play it."
FantasyLCS,3d2w8o,alclarity,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:23:08 2015 UTC,"Look, the only one player that I have kept every single week is febiven. I picked him 1st when I got my turn in the draft (rekkles and huni were already picked). My team for the first week was: cabochard, santorin, febiven, altec, kasing, incarnation and Team liquid. It was not a particularly good draft but I managed to get Niels (I thought he was really good) and he helped me a lot.My team for this week is soaz, santorin, febiven, hjarnan, adrian, fenix and h2k (and my subs are all new comparing to the first week). So as you can see, it is almost completely different.  I am currently in first position with most points and 5 wins (second guy has 3 wins) so I just need one more win or to make good points overall, so my strategy is, keep changing your team in accordance to what the matchups are. Also, try to play safe rather than picking players like freeze(my second week :/) or candypanda (still won although he scored really bad) when you think that if they win they will score very high points."
FantasyLCS,3d2w8o,skapuntz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:31:32 2015 UTC,"Context: I drafted in twenty leagues. With week 7 in the books, my results are as followed:    League Type # of Leagues Top 1/2 3/4/5 6/7/8    4 Man 1 1 (2nd) N/A N/A   6 Man 4 3 (1st, 1st, 2nd) NA 1 (5th)   8 Man 15 7 (1st, 1st,  1st, 2nd, 2nd, 2nd, 2nd) 3 (3rd, 4th, 4th) 5 (6th, 6th, 6th, 7th, 7th)    So I shat the bed in 6 of my leagues, stabilized in 3 of them, and are near or at the top of the table in 11. I'm sure there are bigger fish in the ocean, come to obliterate my numbers, but I like the way my approach turned out. There were disadvantages, as I'll highlight, but it gave me teams a chance to compete every week.   Top Lane: I actually did not prioritize Huni. Hindsight is 50/50, but his fantasy points have plummeted a full 2 points per game, and the competition is a lot fiercer, as Impact, Quas, and Hauntzer are all within ~2 points of him. I believed that if I could get Impact, Quas, or Hauntzer, they would be worth the risk I would pay in other areas of the draft, and having secured one of them in 14 of my leagues, I can say avoiding Huni was worth it. I did pick up Gamsu, just as Dig hit their stride mid-split, and kept him to see if he would maintain that hot streak. Needless to say, he hasn't, but he's still a carry top, capable of dropping points when Dig can actually win games.  Jungler: I despise Santorin as a jungler. Won't even give him the day of light as a jungler, despite the fact he's fantasy gold. So I took the next best thing in Rush. In most of my drafts, Reignover was still open when Rush was, and I might have had a safer jungler, but as the stats indicate, Rush is 1st in kills and 3rd in Assists and the only with a quadra to his name. I was only able to get him in 7 of my 20 drafts, and when I was drafting in the later rounds, I really, really needed a jungler. So I took a chance, betting that no one else would have the balls to select Move, and I was able to get him in 13 of my leagues (If Move was dropped, I immediately took him, even if I had Rush or Reignover, for the sake of denial. He hasn't produced like a top 5 jungler, but because he's on one of the hottest teams, he's likely to do well regardless, hence my strategy) I stayed away from Svenskeren for the longest time, and then when I decided to start him this week, SK... well, you know what happened. Also, Diamond. Poor, poor diamond. -10 PPG from last split to this split.  Mid: Febiven or bust. He was my number 1 pick going into every single draft when I didn't have outright 1st pick, and the stats don't lie, 1st in deaths, 2nd in kills, 3rd in assists, 1st by PPG. I did screw up by drafting Incarnation more often than I should have, but I think no one could have predicted the way C9 would implode this split. Outside of Febi, I mostly drafted a mix of Keane, Fenix, XWX, and Ninja (?!) before I knew about TDK's visa snafu. Needless to say, I've started picking him up in my leagues, because if he can produce 40 PPW in an 0-2 week, I'd like to see what he might do in an 2-0 week. And there was this person called Soren...  ADC: This is where I can unequivocally say I screwed up a lot of my drafts. While Febiven was my #1 priority, I did not prioritize ADC as much as I should have. I wanted to believe in the hope that was Freeze. Week one he proved me right, then all the other weeks went to hell as I had to dive for other ADCs. What I've ended up with is mostly mostly Altec, followed by WT, Piglet, and Hjarnan, and then spatterings of Rekkles and Apollo. Not bad, but the gamble paid off in some leagues and didn't in others.   Support: Support was my #2 priority, surprisingly, because I noticed the PPGs for support drop off sharply after a certain point during Spring Split, and while that hasn't turned out to be the case, Yellowstar (6/20) is still producing like a god. I overprioritized Lustboy (7/20), looking back on it now in light of his recent performance, though I can't really damn him for TSM failing to learn to play the game. Support is so tied to team success, so shrug. The rest of the slots were filled by Kasing, BunnyFuFuu, or Adrian over time.  Team: H2K/TSM/OG/TL  In a nutshell, my strategy was this:  Febiven > Rekkles/Yellowstar/Lustboy > Reignover/Quas/Impact/Rush/ADC > Hauntzer/Incarnation/Freeze/Forgiven > Jungle/Support/Top/Team > Move/Ninja > Fills."

I think Emperor would be better, because the T8 game should be a bloodbath for both teams. Sure, they'll get bodied by TIP, but he'll at least get one good game's worth of points."

FantasyLCS,3d2reh,scumbagJudas,2,Mon Jul 13 09:56:09 2015 UTC,Wow that's just wow lol ummmm personally I would go with Adryh due to Giants having a bigger chance of pulling off an upset. I'm sorry this is the pool to choose from my friend.
FantasyLCS,3d2reh,Teeroy20,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:00:34 2015 UTC,"I have Hjärnan and Turtle, but I can also pick Adryh and Emperor. What would you do?"
FantasyLCS,3d2reh,disturbedman,2,Mon Jul 13 14:14:28 2015 UTC,Just start Hjarnan man. It's not hard hell give you the most points easy!
FantasyLCS,3d2reh,Teeroy20,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:14:46 2015 UTC,"I have Rallez as my starter and Adryh and Emperor as options. Not the best pool to pick from but I'm not sure who to go with since it's one tough match-up for each, regardless."
FantasyLCS,3d2reh,nihontiger,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:58:50 2015 UTC,Take Adryh since giants have a better chance of upsetting a team more than the others.
FantasyLCS,3d2reh,Teeroy20,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:14:17 2015 UTC,Altec or WildTurtle?
FantasyLCS,3d2reh,DirtyMcClane,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:12:10 2015 UTC,Take altec due to you don't even know if turtle will start both games or if he'll even do good either. Take the consistent man here over the slumping one
FantasyLCS,3d2reh,Teeroy20,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:13:32 2015 UTC,Wildturtle or vardags
FantasyLCS,3d2reh,LinKCTG,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:52:57 2015 UTC,Take vardags here since there has been no news of who will be starting for tsm. Until then keep him starting in place.
FantasyLCS,3d2reh,Teeroy20,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:11:44 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that Kikis stepped down from UoL jg.  Gilius will be starting in their JG position. Not sure how UoL would perform this week either.

FantasyLCS,3d2reh,Koholintian,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:05:20 2015 UTC,Altec or Apollo?
FantasyLCS,3d2reh,Teeroy20,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:58:22 2015 UTC,Altec is way hot with gravity so he has a better chance of carrying for you
FantasyLCS,3d2reh,FIR3_5TICK,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:12:52 2015 UTC,"Start'em both. They're set up to have a great week this week, with TIP vs TSM being the only match you'll need to worry about"

FantasyLCS,3d2rf8,firesnap6789,2,Mon Jul 13 04:05:24 2015 UTC,"CLG has a very iffy week: they have a very long standing losing record against TL and no one knows which C9 will show up next week: the one that's been here all split or the one that showed up in the Dig game.  TL has a slightly less risky week: they are against CLG (who, as mentioned before they have a winning record against) and NME who's very much looking like (sadly) at most a 7th place team and just suffered a demoralizing 0-2 week.  However, I think H2K has an incredibly easy week. H2K is almost definitely going to beat CW and I give them a large, large chance of beating GIA this week.\  Go Ryu."

FantasyLCS,3d2rf8,b0nb0mb,2,Mon Jul 13 06:31:37 2015 UTC,1st Keane due to the overall focus that Gravity brings to mid and the playmaking he provides can give you major points with him.  2nd Alec due to bunny he has turned into a top flight adc and gets great team fight kills so he can certainly cash in for you in fantasy. 3rd Hjarnan due to H2K being up and down these past weeks it causes him to slide down due to gravity being on a hot streak. He has the potential to carry and have big points but only if the team doesn't throw early.  4th Xpeke due to the lack of kill participation and overall origen don't center the mid lane as priority it causes him to be the worst in this bunch.
FantasyLCS,3d2rf8,Teeroy20,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:08:47 2015 UTC,"Bjerg, Keane or Doublelift?"
FantasyLCS,3d2rf8,niv77,2,Mon Jul 13 10:09:25 2015 UTC,Ewww doubielift! Lol honstly take Keane here due to gravity on a serge and showing up these past couple of weeks. Compare to clg and tsm both slumping.

FantasyLCS,3d2rf8,niv77,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:38:39 2015 UTC,Bench doublelift for berj! He won't carry hard this week and clg had been down recently. So put him on the bench

TiP if they play well wil for sure get more points and honestly i'd go with them seeing as they're on an upswing vs a struggling TSM and a last place TDK"

FantasyLCS,3d2rf8,lustylust,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:40:26 2015 UTC,I'd go with Mithy if you want to be safe. The others all have harder matchups on paper. Dig have been on a decline and there's rumors that the SK team isn't happy with nRated apparently already having left. Roccat play Fnatic which although have looked weak early recently are still more than likely to take a win off Roccat and Giants are more than capable of beating them as well. OG by comparison have the easiest schedule.

FantasyLCS,3d2rf8,Tobydog3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:50:18 2015 UTC,Amazing. CLG play TL who they have like a 12 losing streak against or something of that nature and a surprisingly re-surging C9 now that Hai is back. His shotcalling if on point could lose CLG the game alone.

FantasyLCS,3d2rf8,Muggog_Skumgut,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:51:48 2015 UTC,"Hauntzer or Amazing. Both ave easy schedules on paper. GV might win their game too clean though so it might affect Hauntzer, but their average game length is like 40 minutes so I expect a decent number of points from them."
FantasyLCS,3d2rf8,SAFFATLOL,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:11:43 2015 UTC,"So I have Nukeduck and Adryh as my spar adc/mid, but I was thinking I could mabye go double top because I have both Hauntzer and Impact who normally score in the 40s. Thoughts?"
FantasyLCS,3d2rf8,hoochmen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:50:44 2015 UTC,I'd go with the double top as Hauntzer is likely to get good points and Impulse have an easy game and a very winnable game vs TSM. Meanwhile roccat play Fnatic this weeks and Giants play H2K and Roccat which could go either way.

FantasyLCS,3d2rf8,laboonspride,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:55:12 2015 UTC,"I would say bjerg. Clg has a rough week especially with c9 showing a few signs of life. I know tsm is in a shakey spot right now, but bjerg is still bjerg."
FantasyLCS,3d2rf8,mariosancez,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:56:40 2015 UTC,Thanks! Since both CLG and TSM have been a bit iffy I put in Ryu and Hjarnan and mid and ADC respectively (God bless Ryu)
FantasyLCS,3d2rf8,laboonspride,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:44:59 2015 UTC,Fenix or Altec???
FantasyLCS,3d2rf8,Dareios-,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:46:38 2015 UTC,"I would go with both of you can, altec  is probably safer though Fenix is pretty strong right now and can get  a lot of points. I would play altec if you are confident in your week and Fenix if you need a bit of a gamble."
FantasyLCS,3d2rf8,mariosancez,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:56:19 2015 UTC,"Febiven, PoE, Altec, or Hjar?  Pick 3"

FantasyLCS,3d2rf8,BarraCuda93,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:25:12 2015 UTC,Apollo or fenix? Leaning towards fenix since they have an easier week
