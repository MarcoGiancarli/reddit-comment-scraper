fireemblemcasual,3e56u5,Gimli_the_Nig,3,Wed Jul 22 01:19:10 2015 UTC,"I'm extremely socially anxious. I know I look good, I know that when I do talk it can be interesting, but I can't bring myself to talk to people.  It might be fear of being judged by others. I was quite social as a child, but I was also very inappropriate. So somewhere down the line I just stopped talking."
fireemblemcasual,3e56u5,punk_emblem,2,Wed Jul 22 01:26:47 2015 UTC,"This is definitely a big part of social anxiety. We don't become fearful of interaction because we just are scared of it, it's because we learned we were fucking it up the whole time and now we're scared we're going to keep fucking it up. Now that I'm painfully aware of every embarrasing thing I did when I was younger, I'm paranoid I'm doing the same sort of stuff now. Among close friends I still have moments when I'm not sure if what I'm saying is the right thing, and when trying to talk to people I don't know well, I spend time afterward dreading how much they hated every little movement I made, when they probably didn't even take notice of it."

fireemblemcasual,3e56u5,paper_roses,3,Wed Jul 22 01:26:48 2015 UTC,"I really feel like there are very few people who actually don't give a shit about anyone else's opinions.  I was extremely shy and had no self esteem for most of my life, but eventually I found a group of people who were really accepting of who I was and it made me feel more comfortable to be myself around other people.  Once I saw that that was working too, the self esteem skyrocketed.  I still have my moments of being shy and awkward, and I'm pretty sure I always will, but getting involved with the right people definitely helped me get rid of a lot of that."

You can be 100% sure that you won't do anything wrong, that you aren't offending someone, or that whatever is going on is all in good grace, but it doesn't matter, it's always going to be there, at the back of your mind. It's why getting help and taking advice is so hard, there's no easy answer or solution, it's just something you have to live with."
fireemblemcasual,3e56u5,Eastern-Eagle,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:42:23 2015 UTC,"Well there's actual social anxiety which is closer to a phobia, but I don't think that what you're talking about.  I dunno I guess eventually you get to realize that, no matter how much you worry about it, or how much time you spend on it, in the end the people who have the time/energy/motivation to actually think nasty things about you aren't the type of people you want around you anyways.   Most people aren't going to care if you're wearign red to day or if your shoes are mismatched or if you have a pimple on your forehead, because they have them too."

Personally I wouldn't say that I have the most serious case of social anxiety, but I believe the way I deal with it has made it just as severe. Don't try this, but the way I've dealt with it is by running away from it. Actively avoiding situations where anxiety would creep up on me. This has as a result made me miss out on tons of opportunities in my life, and as a result stunted my growth as an individual. There's more to this, but I feel like it would begin to stray away from the given topic. But in any case, I still have the desire to overcome it, so that's a plus.  I understand you when you say that what people tell you aren't useful. I however have never really beaten myself up over it. I realized at some point that things like this don't have an affect on me. So I can't really look at these things and feel the need to change."
fireemblemcasual,3e56u5,pik3rob,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:33:38 2015 UTC,"We here want to help each other, so I believe this is a perfectly fine post.  I'm a very shy person myself, so I know what that's like. However, sometimes I feel the need to talk to someone that I have never seen in my life. I always need a reason to do so. I usually do that sort of stuff when I see someone wearing a shirt of a band I either like or know of. I never had a time where I've done such a thing and the person judged me for that. Strangers don't know anything about you, so if you introduce yourself with only positives to them, they'll only think about you positively. So what if you don't look the best or aren't the most interesting person, as long as you try to make a good impression, people will generally think of you in a nice way. If they do judge you on your looks, then that's not the kind of people you'd want to be with anyway."

I've had everything from a bit of a stutter to just being too ""smart"" for people to talk to. I don't think there's really any quick tips that I know of, but whenever I talk to someone or am just walking around, I've found it easier to just focus on myself. My posture, maintaining eye contact, and making sure I'm paying attention to everything around me help me a lot with keeping the nerves down. My stutter only ever appears when I don't know what to say or are unsure of what to say, so keeping my mind only on little things like that help me out."

Like talking to a store employee about something, get comfortable with that, then move on to something a bit bigger, then on and on until you can talk to strangers with little problem, if any at all. This is how I'm trying to cope with it, and I've been told volunteering at places and HAVING to talk to people helps a lot. Sometimes. Just don't over exert yourself and just get like ""Screw humans I'm done"" and lock yourself off from the world. Slow and steady."
fireemblemcasual,3e56u5,UltimateGir,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:48:49 2015 UTC,"Uh, I'm sure I'm in no way properly qualified to help with this sort of stuff (how much schooling do you have to go through to be a psychologist/psychiatrist, again?), but if anyone will care for it, I can try to help a bit. I do apologize if I manage to botch this, as I do manage to phrase things poorly on occasion.  I'd say it's fine to be worried about society; after all, the world is a tremendously complex place, and things can go badly from just one little cause. But do note that: A, most situations are on a scale that doesn't warrant such concern (you're not trying to win a multi-gazillion dollar bid, fight in a war, or do something like that, right?), and then that B, even if there is some sort of mistake or concern, much more often than not you'll be able to rectify it (if you're in good company, and if you're not, then that's an unfortunate problem).  After all, everyone else around you is quite concerned as well-they just try to mask it. We're all a heck of a lot more like each other than anyone thinks (which is decidedly unfortunate in a few ways), so your concerns are held by quite a few other people, particularly people who you think wouldn't normally be so. I'm sure there are some people who you (or anyone) think are quite carefree, but in reality they have their worries too. Of course, there are some people who are just completely devil-may-care (I'll probably never quite understand them), but there are always ends to every, and any, spectrum.  So really, I guess I'm trying to say that you're not alone, and that there are quite a lot of people who are just as worried and concerned as you are, even if they don't show it."

For me going to anime club in college club helped because I was with other nerdy people. Outside of college you could use Meetup.com, I used it before and you could use it to find anime fans, video game fans, etc. Conventions are fun too, but I understand that the things I talked about may not be around you, so you may have to try something new like bowling or something to meet people. Going out and trying sometime new is hard, but it might work. It's still really hard for me to make friends I only have one or two real good friends in real life, but it was fun hanging out with people."

fireemblemcasual,3e4l17,Ark_Inek,2,Wed Jul 22 01:15:34 2015 UTC,"You're right and you're not right.  In general, the opinion of Chrono Cross is that it is a very good game, but a poor sequel to Chrono Trigger because the story is very complicated and doesn't incorporate the events of Trigger the way many people expected it to.  Admittedly, that was my opinion of it too when I first completed the game (as a game in and of itself, I really had very few problems with it).  The story drops a lot of important information very late in the game, which makes it very difficult to keep up with, and on top of that, it's got a lot of complicated subject material (alternate timelines and whatnot).  Once you do understand the story though, it does add up, but there are still some stones left unturned, so that's why I want a prequel to it to explain how the events of Trigger transitioned into the events of Cross."

fireemblemcasual,3e4hnc,Chastlily,11,Tue Jul 21 22:00:15 2015 UTC,"I suppose I should explain.   Some backstory: back in December/January I came back to Hawaii for winter break expecting to go back to east coast to continue my college career (was 2nd year at this point). However I found out I wasn't able to go back because of $$$ issues so I had to ""drop out"" and be stuck in Hawaii (was around this time I first started to post here). At that point it was too late to apply to the local college so I spent the past spring semester doing part time work, being bummed, and applied for next semester at the local college.   Fast forward to like a week and a half ago, I got the letter that declined me for the incoming fall semester at the local college. Once again I was feeling pretty bummed out and shit. Didn't help that I grew distanced from my east coast friends cause of the time zones, also Hawaii acquaintances kept making plans without telling me. The Skype shit was just the Straw that broke the camel's back. So I took a break from posting on Reddit and chat groups for the past week.  So yea I'm still waiting to hear back from the community college to see if I'll at least get into that, if not I'm have to continue working at part times jobs and shit.  So yea hi, I'm kind of back (much to the chagrin of some of you people I'm sure).  Tl:dr IRL stuff making me bummed out, didn't want to deal with FEC's shit so I took a break til I felt better.  Today I'm taking my car in for scheduled maintenance."

fireemblemcasual,3e4hnc,KeksKrebs,2,Tue Jul 21 22:13:53 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between putting yourself above others, and holding yourself to a higher standard - may I ask for clarification on which one you meant?"
fireemblemcasual,3e4hnc,ByakurenX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:31:24 2015 UTC,"You may ask for a clarification as I can see where you are coming from.  However, I kind of view them as being incredibly similar, as putting yourself up to a higher standard then someone else is also in part saying that you're better than them or you can't expect them to reach the same standards that you set for yourself.  I do see the viewpoint you are coming from though so I will clarify as this, does it appear as if I hold myself to a higher standard than other people?"
fireemblemcasual,3e4hnc,overallprettyaverage,2,Tue Jul 21 22:38:18 2015 UTC,"From my point of view they're quite different - the former is assuming that you're superior, whereas the latter is being hard on yourself: less forgiving of mistakes, forcing yourself to try and do more, etc.  I suppose it's possible that such an attitude could be rooted in a sense that you can do better than everyone else, but I've seen more examples of it being founded on fears of not being good enough, and trying to avoid slipping up, while at the same time being forgiving.  I think that you'll have a better idea of how well that latter description fits you than I do, but I would think that it wouldn't be less accurate than the alternatives that have been presented."

Did nothing and hoped someone would come over, to no avail. Ugh. And if you are wondering why don't I just ask people to come over, I can only contact one of my close friends through Steam and he hasn't really been online that much. The other two just come over when they feel like it. I have more friends, but I don't like bothering them, which is why I usually hang out with the same three people."

fireemblemcasual,3e4hnc,RedWolke,2,Tue Jul 21 22:19:36 2015 UTC,"It was his choice, since I was just hoping he even wanted to do anything, but it is definitely a fantastic game. I still never beat it, even I played it so many times. I actually only ever beat one Zelda game and that's OoT 3D. So, this is going to be like playthrough #5 for me."
fireemblemcasual,3e4hnc,Waele,2,Tue Jul 21 22:22:10 2015 UTC,"Well then your friend has made an excellent choice.  Twilight Princess is my second favorite Zelda, behind only OoT.  You should definitely finish it, as it has probably my favorite final boss fight ever."
fireemblemcasual,3e4hnc,RedWolke,2,Tue Jul 21 22:24:40 2015 UTC,"It's gonna take a bit of time. The reason we never finish games we play is because we play during the summer, then school starts, making us less available to do stuff."

But... still, it sucks. I won't be able to even make an appointment for two more weeks, and even if I could get hearing aids before the summer's end, nobody will be hiring. New plan: working desk staff at uni. They do a hire in January and I'll know if my (finally not insane) program will work with me having a job on campus like that.

Nice visuals, although the animators aren't too good at character side profiles.  I have a huge crush on Worick, and his profession makes so much sense, that it's hilarious.  I keep meaning to read more of Diamond Is Unbreakable, but I haven't... yet.  Durara X2 Ten is on it's third episode and I wish it was already complete, so I could watch all of it at once."

fireemblemcasual,3e455c,Blaze64,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:00:15 2015 UTC,"Castle Town Dandelion is still anime of the season. Episode 3 while not as good as Episode 2, was still great. Especially because we get more of Teru, and Teru is the best. He's like a chuunibyou, whose entire real life situation actually justifies his behavior. He's also not over the top, so that's a plus as well.  Gate Episode 3 was great. Best girl arrived, so I see things only going up from here.  Watched Monster Musume Episode 3. The show is beginning to get repetitive, but I've been assured that it will get better. Also, I've finally decided that Centorea is best girl.  Started watching Gakkou Gurashi. I actually really like this show. It's giving me lots of Yuuki Yuuna vibes, and that's a good thing, since Yuuki Yuuna is among my top 10 favorite anime. I also didn't know anything going in, so the twist was really surprising. Especially considering how generic it seemed beforehand.  Chaos Dragon Episode 3 was a bit disappointing. Nobody died.  Finally, I've finally continued Majikoi, since the S translation just finished. I'm in the middle of Miyako's route, and I really like it so far. I actually didn't expect to shed a tear, but I did. It also helped me like Chris' character a lot more. I actually didn't like her at one point, but I'm starting to warm up to her. This is probably due to my recent liking of characters with an obsession with justice. Also, Moro continues to be the best character. Just putting that out there."

One thing I want to point out is the change of atmosphere in the opening. The other openings were more upbeat, and showed Mikado early on, at the beginning of them (except in the first one, and even then, it was pretty upbeat). On this one he is shown as the beginning and the ending of it all, and seeing him being gloomy until the last scene is really different from everything else we had so far.  I am really waiting great things from this season."

fireemblemcasual,3e292a,Sabertwooth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:00:24 2015 UTC,"Heyo! I am currently playing through Dai Gyakuten Saiban. I have basic knowledge of hiragana and katakana, learning some kanji. Despite the crippling language barrier, I have managed to make it to case 4 with not too many trials and errors.  Gotta say, this is so far one of my top 3 PW games. The soundtrack is awesome, really goes well with the feel and the time of the game. The questioning allegro and Sherlock Holmes' theme are some of my favorites. The characters are pretty cool too. A lot of different personalities, but a little more tame when it compares to other games. I find this okay, because they all fit well with the era.  From what I have gathered, the cases are pretty good. The third one is my favorite so far. Surprisingly, the first 3 felt a lot... less chunky. What I mean, is that the 1st case is a trial segment, the 2nd is investigating and questioning with no trial and the 3rd was also just a trial. Usually, the 3rd would have atleast an investigation and trial segment, but given the context of the case, an investigation would be pretty useless, so I see why Capcom did that.  The new WARNING! MAJOR SPOILERS IN VIDEO! joint reasoning mechanic is cool. Basically, Sherlock gives his deductions about a person, then arrives at a conclusion, usually accusing said person of something. It's then up to us to analyze the person themselves and find things that Sherlock missed to ultimately arrive at a completely different conclusion. It's a great change of pace from ye olde questioning and objectioning. The dynamic camera makes it look so actionyNotAWord and exciting.  The WARNING! MILD SPOILERS IN VIDEO! multiple witnesses and jury battles are also a great addition to the game. It never feels like i'm doing the same thing. There is always something different that comes up to WOW me. The different personalities on the stand testifying in their own ways, some will react to what others say, which could lead to more testimony. With that music in the background while your doing it, It really gets you into involved and all like "" Alright, let's do this"" type of mood.  Overall so far, fantastic game and I can't wait to finish the last 2 cases!"

fireemblemcasual,3e1z3x,Chastlily,3,Tue Jul 21 10:28:35 2015 UTC,cmon chast this is a tradition now you have to post a selfie
fireemblemcasual,3e1z3x,ChaosDevilDragon,2,Tue Jul 21 09:57:50 2015 UTC,Are you feeling that 40 degree Celsius heat too  cause I'm feeling it and I actually look like I'm drowning in my own sweat*
fireemblemcasual,3e1z3x,Chastlily,2,Tue Jul 21 10:31:07 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't have AC but I still manage! It only gets bad when I need to get running/carry stuff.  How dying are you?"
fireemblemcasual,3e1z3x,ChaosDevilDragon,2,Tue Jul 21 10:32:19 2015 UTC,I don't have an AC either and I'm currently lying down on the ceramic tile floor for some relief
fireemblemcasual,3e1z3x,punk_emblem,2,Tue Jul 21 10:41:31 2015 UTC,In Italy or France? I don't remember o:  What did you do of your day?
fireemblemcasual,3e1z3x,punk_emblem,2,Tue Jul 21 10:46:57 2015 UTC,In Albania  Was in Rome over the weekend (heat rash incident a few days ago)  Yesterday I just fell asleep before the HWYD thread because I hadn't slept at all and I spent all day visiting people
fireemblemcasual,3e1z3x,punk_emblem,2,Tue Jul 21 10:54:41 2015 UTC,I see o:  Enjoying it all?

fireemblemcasual,3e1z3x,Bullwine85,3,Tue Jul 21 11:49:07 2015 UTC,i'm actually just incredibly bored and it's 8 am so no one's awake and netflix has nothing good so this happened. also did you miss my pic my dog is cute as fuck  edit: you look great as always punk
fireemblemcasual,3e1z3x,Sabertwooth,2,Tue Jul 21 12:01:47 2015 UTC,Well certainly there are better ideas than selfie thread. And yes you and your dog look gorg.
fireemblemcasual,3e1z3x,MageToLight,2,Tue Jul 21 12:09:29 2015 UTC,"I mean, yes, there are better things to do but nothing that particularly interests me. So poorly timed selfie thread it is.  also thx punk"
fireemblemcasual,3e1z3x,InvdrZim13,3,Tue Jul 21 12:14:36 2015 UTC,Well the problem here is that you did too early and on a day that no one would really have time. It's fine if you feel like shitpisting but this kind of messes with the schedule.
fireemblemcasual,3e1z3x,Gimli_the_Nig,2,Tue Jul 21 12:46:16 2015 UTC,"I feel like this thread/the other one I posted should pretty much be ignored in terms of the schedule. It's a pretty good time for the europeans but still. These threads (at least when I post them) are not gonna be a thing that happens regularly, and since you and Hawaiian have said it's a bad time and not on schedule I'll probably not post another one."

fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Ark_Inek,2,Tue Jul 21 03:28:17 2015 UTC,lol nice alternating on that last sentence there =p
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Littlethieflord,2,Tue Jul 21 03:03:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks, you can tell that my cursive is really sloppy in that sentence especially because it just looks so much worse than the other ones.  And yes, I did write that all in one smooth motion. I'm already used to switching between the print styles because I have a tablet pc and I use the handwriting recognition because it can be faster but it doesn't work with my ""all capitals"" style. But I only really use cursive for lab reports since it's a bit easier to distinguish between chemical formulas and explanations that way."
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Ark_Inek,2,Tue Jul 21 03:06:09 2015 UTC,"=P my philosophy has always been, if it can be read, it's good.  And nice, I'd have to practice to do that w/o thinking about it.   blegh! lab reports"
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Littlethieflord,2,Tue Jul 21 03:12:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess you do have a point with that.  Surprisingly it didn't take all that much thought, I had already decided on a pattern to write it in and knew exactly what I wanted to say so it was easier than I thought it would be.  And I'm a Chemical Engineering major, I write lab reports fairly frequently."
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Ark_Inek,2,Tue Jul 21 03:18:19 2015 UTC,I can already tell you'd be good at rhythm games =P.  But the labs themselves are always so much more fun! says the person whose science grades were saved only thanks to labs
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Littlethieflord,2,Tue Jul 21 03:25:56 2015 UTC,"I am pretty good at rhythm games, but I always assumed that was because I played two instruments already.  And yeah, labs are a great grade boost since for the most part you don't have to know anything for them. That is, until you get to the labs where you have to write and figure out everything on your own."
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Ark_Inek,2,Tue Jul 21 03:31:09 2015 UTC,XD why not both?  lol and thus I thanked the stars that my lab finals were open-note =P.
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Littlethieflord,2,Tue Jul 21 03:33:53 2015 UTC,"That is true, it is probably a combination of both.  And you're very lucky in that aspect, all of my lab tests weren't open note."
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Ark_Inek,2,Tue Jul 21 03:34:45 2015 UTC,"Indeed, although it was just for GE credit (intro to Phys) so likely the prof was just hoping not to see us again LOL."
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Littlethieflord,4,Tue Jul 21 03:55:03 2015 UTC,Print because cursive is the devil that I must know because the person who hands out work order only works in it.  Me and my co-workers swear she writes it in some sort of code...
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,EclipsedLunus,3,Tue Jul 21 02:48:31 2015 UTC,"I used to cursive everything in middle school, but nobody else did it. I thought that cursive wasn't cool anymore, so I trained myself to write in print. Now, I don't even remember how to write or read cursive. It didn't make me cool either :( Moral of the story: Fuck peer pressure. People don't judge you by your writing."
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Sabertwooth,3,Tue Jul 21 01:47:01 2015 UTC,"Well since my handwriting looks like the scribbles of a madman no matter what I'll say print for speed, cursive so I look like a classy madman."
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,SkyLadyAnnemarie,2,Tue Jul 21 01:53:03 2015 UTC,Classy madmen tend to be even more mad.
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,RedWolke,3,Tue Jul 21 02:11:53 2015 UTC,"I used to cursive, but that made it almost illegible. When I entered high school I was like ""You know what, fuck that shit"" and started to use print. I must say that it looks a lot better."
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Littlethieflord,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:57:19 2015 UTC,"lol it does but eh, slow lol"
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,RedWolke,2,Tue Jul 21 02:29:40 2015 UTC,"Well, I am actually just as fast with print as I am with cursive, so for me is not a problem."
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Littlethieflord,2,Tue Jul 21 02:31:19 2015 UTC,"Really? Nice =).  I find cursive much faster mostly because I don't have to lift my pencil off paper although, might also be because I've been writing cursive all my life lol  but lol yeah it's pretty hard to read."
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Ark_Inek,2,Tue Jul 21 02:34:48 2015 UTC,"If you're left handed, there is almost no way that cursive could be faster. Instead of dragging the pen across the paper like you normally would, I have to drag it and it requires both more force and ends up smearing more often than if I print. If you look at my comment I can use both, but print will always be faster for me as a lefty."
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Littlethieflord,2,Tue Jul 21 02:59:47 2015 UTC,Ah I see. I didn't think about that.
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Ark_Inek,2,Tue Jul 21 03:01:00 2015 UTC,"Nobody does, it's one of those things that not a lot of people even realize is a thing but it can be a real problem. You can buy a really nice pen (which I do have) that you can't write with very well at all because it wasn't designed to be pushed across the paper."
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Littlethieflord,2,Tue Jul 21 03:03:47 2015 UTC,"hm yeah, and now that I think about it, a lot of drawing tools would be a problem if you're trying to push it into the paper.  It's too bad you can't just write whichever way way based on your dominant hand reading would be hard"
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Ark_Inek,2,Tue Jul 21 03:09:09 2015 UTC,"I actually have heard of people writing in reverse to make it easier and fix the problems that I've had, but that requires way too much planning and forward thinking for me, and typing would become much more of a chore since I'd be used to writing my sentences from the end. It would be a pretty cool thing to show off though."
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Littlethieflord,2,Tue Jul 21 03:10:33 2015 UTC,.lol fun be would it though  You're right that took far longer than it should thinking backwards I mean  haha. Nice party trick for all the ladies?
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Zangam,2,Tue Jul 21 03:16:21 2015 UTC,"This whole time I thought cursive was the weird thing to use.  Then I come here and everyone is like ""I've been using cursive since I could hold a pencil""  Me? I learned it in third grade, did my classwork that required it, and then went right back to using letters I could actually read.  (My teachers being able to read it is a completely different story.)  Now I only remember how to write my name in cursive."
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Littlethieflord,2,Tue Jul 21 03:36:15 2015 UTC,"Hahaha XD and most of us still prefer print.  I use cursive mostly because that's what my mom taught me first (well kind of cursive, peculiarly enough she used print capitals) so that's all I was writing using pretty much until I came into first grade and the teacher was like WTF is wrong with this kid.  I learned how to print then =P."
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,kofca,3,Tue Jul 21 03:43:30 2015 UTC,"Who writes things anymore?  Actually I probably use cursive more now, only because most of time when I am writing, I am just signing something.  Though I still prefer to write in print."
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,vanime,3,Tue Jul 21 02:34:47 2015 UTC,I use both but prefer cursive cause it's faster. If I need it to be legible I use print though.
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,GPuzzle1,3,Tue Jul 21 02:48:14 2015 UTC,Print. My cursive looks like me trying to write the Necronomicon.

fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,paper_roses,3,Tue Jul 21 03:06:05 2015 UTC,"Fuck cursive. People always said it was faster than print, but it always took me 5 times longer to look worse, so eventually stopped trying. I print everything now, signatures included. Still looks awful, but at least it's fast."
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,MartyStu,2,Tue Jul 21 09:54:33 2015 UTC,"My writing is a weird amalgamation of print and cursive, but I'll say cursive since it's faster to write."

fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Toadinator2000,2,Tue Jul 21 02:08:28 2015 UTC,I like cursive better because it means I'm signing things which makes me feel important
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,pik3rob,2,Tue Jul 21 02:10:16 2015 UTC,Cursive is pretty pointless IMO.  Except for signing your name of course.
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Toadinator2000,2,Tue Jul 21 02:14:42 2015 UTC,"People actually use cursive for signing their name? I though you just write the first letter of your name, followed by squiggles."

fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Toadinator2000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:23:08 2015 UTC,"No. Cursive letters usually actually have some resemblance to their print version. But in signatures, people stop caring and put squiggles. Nobody cares, so I don't blame them."

fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,pik3rob,2,Tue Jul 21 02:24:18 2015 UTC,Cursive....so much faster I can't take notes in print a all.
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,Blinkingsky,2,Tue Jul 21 02:28:46 2015 UTC,Print. Only like 8 people actually use cursive nowadays.
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,UnknownSpartan,2,Tue Jul 21 02:29:01 2015 UTC,"Outside of my signature, just print."
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,MEMgrizzlies7,2,Tue Jul 21 02:56:42 2015 UTC,Cursive is slower for me. All it did was make my handwriting illegible for many of my teachers. I'm better served with print.

fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,OtakuReborn,2,Tue Jul 21 04:06:22 2015 UTC,"Cursive? What's that?  In all seriousness, I remember the shit I had to go through in elementary school with all those cursive lessons in the 2nd grade. They thought it was really cute to divide the lessons into all of the letters of the alphabet. 26 lessons of cursive in total. Not. fun.  And for what? I don't use it unless I'm signing my name. Heck, I'm surprised I still remember how to sign my name in cursive. Most kids I know forgot long ago and only use squiggles."
fireemblemcasual,3e0pnc,TwentyfootAngels,2,Tue Jul 21 04:58:06 2015 UTC,"I use Cursive for writing a letter/note/card for someone, but I use Print for note taking and other general uses."

Personally I think that getting a parent's opinion on someone you ""love"" is a great idea, provided the parents actually care about you.  My mother married a guy that everyone told her was no good, eight years and two kids later, I'm basically raising my siblings because he left without a word."
fireemblemcasual,3dzxpg,WhatZitTooyah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:02:47 2015 UTC,"But ultimately if someone is a young adult it's their choice, I understand if you're like 16-18 but everyone makes mistakes. The parents in this came across very rudely to me to the man who was asking for their daughter's hand in marriage. Getting an opinion is a good thing, I agree, but permission seems so outdated and simply rather sexist in how it's done as well.  It's sad that such a bad thing happened to your mother, though."
fireemblemcasual,3dzxpg,WhatZitTooyah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:06:09 2015 UTC,"I agree, like I said, it's a dumb practice. As I said, didn't actually watch it. Probably won't now, but if they're being so harsh to a guy that supposedly loves their daughter, they probably aren't doing it solely because they care.  Sorry, not fishing for pity, it was just a bit of a personal story about how disregarding their opinion (if they care about you) can backfire hard."

fireemblemcasual,3dzxpg,FaZe_BoOtY,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:20:16 2015 UTC,"I know you haven't beaten Nohr yet, but which route are you enjoying the most so far? Are there huge differences besides the obvious ones like world map and difficulty?"
fireemblemcasual,3dzxpg,ApatheticRadiance,3,Mon Jul 20 22:21:15 2015 UTC,"I enjoy Hoshido more so far mostly because of the atmosphere it had. Nohr seems to have something going on with each of its maps which keeps it pretty fresh at times.   The difficulty I would say is actually pretty similar. Nohr enemies have more skills, but your units are higher quality. In Hoshido the enemy isn't actually to amazing, just that most of your units are of lower quality, until Ryoma joins then breaks the difficulty into tiny pieces."
fireemblemcasual,3dzxpg,WhatZitTooyah,2,Mon Jul 20 22:30:26 2015 UTC,"Huh, this is the first time I have heard anyone say that the difficulties are almost the same. How much did you have to rely on the controversial stuff like the face rubbing and hot springs stuff in My Castle to keep your units ahead in Hoshido btw?"
fireemblemcasual,3dzxpg,kofca,2,Mon Jul 20 22:33:57 2015 UTC,"Hot Springs doesn't really do much for you stat wise. Forging is a pain. Face rubbing I only did for the novelty and Spoilers The weapons/Staves shops are really cool and have a good variety(Would be better if I could actually read the text). The quality of the items improve each time you level up the shops. There is an arena, but it doesn't give money/exp instead you bet resources. So if you don't care much for the My Castle stuff you don't even need to bother.   Only really kinda game changing controversial thing is the cooking which gives stat boosts to your army depending on the resources you give and who is cooking(that is random btw).  So I didn't really do any of the my castle stuff very much and turned out fine. I did end up behind though, but that is because of my own stupidity in spreading exp to thin and using to many units. I finished the game with like 12 units 20/3-6. Corrin, Nishiki and Asyura were 20/14&17&18 respectively probably. and Ryoma was 20/20. It was all fine since Ryoma is OP."
fireemblemcasual,3dzxpg,kofca,2,Mon Jul 20 22:48:03 2015 UTC,Glad to hear that all the stuff people were up in arms about at least seems like you don't have to care about all that much to at least get through the game. Great to hear!
fireemblemcasual,3dzxpg,kofca,3,Mon Jul 20 23:03:17 2015 UTC,"In the end it really was optional to me.  But I forgot the accessory shop. Most of the accessories are lame.

In my opinion, she doesn't fully count under the ""weeb"" category but she's pretty bad about her obsession with, well, it's in her name. She likes dating sims. She likes things that are like dating sims.   I met her one afternoon - I was in the library, perusing. She was at a table, playing some 3DS game.   I ask, hey, have you ever heard of Fire Emblem?  She says, ""Hey, that's a great game, I love Fire Emblem Awakening, it's one of my favorite 3DS games.""  We talk a bit.   So there are two stories I like to tell people concerning her. I will give you the first and maybe the second if I feel like it. The first happened directly, day after if I remember correctly, after the announcement that there would be a new Fire Emblem game.   Now, I know she played Awakening and liked it.   I just never asked why.  So the day after FE14 is announced and I am very unexcited, and would remain that way for a while. We hang out at lunch in the library.  She says, ""Hey, did you hear? There's going to be a new Fire Emblem game.""  ""I'm not that excited,"" I say.   She smiles and looks into the distance. ""I hope this one has more dating sim elements.""  I give her a very specific look. It's the borderline between ""my god what the fuck"" and ""are you serious right now"".   We're still friends, by the way.  Oh, and also, I'll tell you about Japanese Club in a bit. I'm a bit busy right now."
fireemblemcasual,3dwq1k,ZeroKarasu,8,Mon Jul 20 04:43:49 2015 UTC,Wow. I used that kind of stuff as a joke.
fireemblemcasual,3dwq1k,punk_emblem,6,Mon Jul 20 04:52:35 2015 UTC,"So the big story in Japanese Club is the very first meeting.   I walk in. You see the usual crowd - there's the girl who would totally wear cat ears if she could get away with it, the acne ridden guy clad in garb from his favorite anime - midway into the year he'd begin wearing an Attack On Titan jacket and a trilby - and some others.   Me (and I suspect some others) were there mainly to say that they'd been in a club during high school - apparently that looks good for colleges. At least that's what I heard.   So the first meeting, they make a couple things very clear.   - This is not ""anime club"", this is Japanese Club. (Despite the fact that they'd advertised at the club fair with anime posters and the like.)  - You should all want to live in Japan, or, at the very least, visit it!  This, well, it trips the weeb alarms.   I attended club most of the year but to be frank I wish I hadn't."
fireemblemcasual,3dwq1k,ZeroKarasu,2,Mon Jul 20 05:05:01 2015 UTC,"well I mean, the visit in Japan would at least be very interesting/informative. knowing the culture behind a language explains a lot about the language itself.  But lol yeah I get what you mean."

Since I never interacted with any of them, I can't quite say I knew what extent their fascination with anime was. However, we did get kids who wore shirts and had cat ears and tails. I thought that was really weird, but they were harmless. Most of the time, they wouldn't talk about it unless they were specifically asked.  One particular occasion comes to mind for me: In my junior year, around Halloween, a girl a year ahead of me dressed up as Naruto. I mean, FULL-ON cosplay. Intricately detailed orange suit, yellow spikey hair (it was a wig since she didn't have the hair to pull it off), headband, sandals, etc. She REALLY got into it. Good for her for not giving a shit about people's opinions, but still, a little bit excessive for school don't you think?"
fireemblemcasual,3dwq1k,korean_salamander,6,Mon Jul 20 05:38:49 2015 UTC,Rather have a nice cosplay than overly revealing costumes being worn in school in Halloween.

He did the Naruto/Sonic run all the time in gym class and stuff. That was about it, I don't think he was a weeaboo, that was me. I taught myself kana in highschool for no reason other than because it was Japanese and it was cool. I wrote random stuff in kana in my notebooks and I felt awesome about it.

Like all of my self esteem has just left and is only now slowly coming back. My little cousins came over which is usually annoying since most of the time they beg to play Nintendo and leave their mlp stuff.

Gonna have to start OV with F. Spit again soon though, which is something I am not at all hyped for.    If incessant DFO isn't counted, then it was a pretty unproductive Sunday. That's okay though."

It wasn't even noon. I miss Elder Scrolls ability to rest and wait anywhere. I spent maybe half an hour staring at my screen. Couldn't even alt-tab because that broke my computer.  Which is why I started replaying Tales of Phantasia, hoping to beat it. Until husband bugged me to play Witcher again."

So I'll provide a list of a few things I thought of, and why.   Iron man suit: the more selfish answer, it would be amazing.   College tuition: essentially, make it so no one would have to pay to go to school. One of many ""if I have all the money I could ever need, I may as well do some good with it"" thoughts. Others include renewable energy, and developing the third world.  NASA. I'm studying to be an aerospace engineer, so this is half-altruistic, half-selfish.   Development of AI.

fireemblemcasual,3du75r,garrulousAuthority,2,Sun Jul 19 15:45:23 2015 UTC,"With metal, mainly progressive metal and thrash metal. With all music, progressive rock in general. When I found out that someone combined my two favorite bands from my childhood, Metallica and Pink Floyd, into one thing, I grew ecstatic.  Also, don't get me wrong, I do like power metal, but I only know few bands that really stand out to me. The only reason why those two I mentioned stand out is because they fuse their music with other genres. Symphony X is progressive metal and Children of Bodom is melodic death metal.  I pretty much love all genres of metal, with the exceptions of brutal death metal, nu-metal, and grindcore related material. I still need to get used to growling before venturing further into death metal."

They're both just racist and rude, and I think my mom is bipolar. Also, so much sibling favoritism. I swear to god. My brother put his foot on the gas pedal while my mom was still getting in the car, she slammed her head into the seat, and started yelling at me and saying it was my fault for getting into the car too slowly. Meanwhile, I had entered from the other side and had no idea what she was talking about. Evidently I'm also not allowed to criticize anything in this trip. I said the Duomo in Florence ""was gorgeous, but a bit excessive"" and they both started yelling at me for being an unappreciative little shit. Don't even get me started on my dad's racism. Every single time he saw an Asian person he said something akin to ""why don't these fuckers just stay in their own country where they belong, or visit Vietnam or something, don't come to fucking Florence"" and I'm just sitting there thinking either ""Dad shut the fuck up"" or ""wait till you find out that A. I'm dating that guy you hate B. Guess what, he doesn't just look Asian, he IS partially Asian!"" Then he tried to lecture me about religion. Every single moment he gets, ever since I told him I'm atheist, he goes into a monologue and tells me I'm going to hell every chance he gets. I make a joke about bacon? STRAIGHT TO HELL. I'm for gay marriage? Fuck you and STRAIGHT TO HELL. The only enjoyment I've had on this trip has been with my brother and my grandparents/aunt/uncle.

fireemblemcasual,3drzee,hunterboyz24,2,Sat Jul 18 22:23:18 2015 UTC,"Skyrim. The main reason I don't like it is how disappointed I was with it when it came out. I was hoping for an improved Oblivion with more snow, but got a very shallow game, in my opinion.  I'm only playing it because I want to play Fallout 3, but my game crashes every time I try to save. I would play Fallout: New Vegas, but I've kinda drained the game of things to do. Oblivion would've been my next choice, but I already had a roleplay character in Skyrim that keeps me wanting to play more. Besides, I would probably abandon said character if I went back to Oblivion, so I want to complete all I want to do in that game. Hell, I haven't even met the first dragon boss in the game and I'm level 52, so I have a lot to do."
fireemblemcasual,3drzee,RedWolke,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:28:44 2015 UTC,Oh! I've always wanted to play Skyrim just for some of the mods they have
fireemblemcasual,3drzee,Ark_Inek,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:34:29 2015 UTC,"Mods are fucking fantastic in Bethesda games. I'm lucky to have a friend who mods as a hobby, since he made a Fallout 3 mod for me. Skyrim's mods are a strange area of mods. The popular mods in Skyrim aren't the serious mods that add a lot of depth to the game. They are usually the Saint's Row style of humor kind of mods. However, the mods that are serious are seriously good. I have a weapon and armor mod just to add diversity to the equipment selection that the base game was lacking. These actually look like they belong in-game, sometimes more than actually in-game items. Mods also helped me make my character look like the actual character he was based on. They allowed me to give him a creepy smile and have hair not found in the base game. I'm just lucky that the mod I got had the exact kind of hair I needed. To show you what I'm talking about, here's my Gangrel character. Not his actual armor, that shit covered his face and all, so I wanted to take it off and have something that looked remotely similar to what he wears in FE:A."
fireemblemcasual,3drzee,OpIvyFanatic,2,Sat Jul 18 22:59:52 2015 UTC,"Ayy that Gangrel looks legit  When it comes to mods, the tone depends on my mood. Added depth and weapons is awesome, but at the same time, Tommy Wisseau dragon, you know?"
fireemblemcasual,3drzee,OpIvyFanatic,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:09:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks friend.  Then Bethesda games are still perfect for that. In fact, that mod my friend made for me is an example of the weird side of things. I saw the Abe Lincoln figure in Fallout 3 and asked my friend to make it into a somewhat balanced weapon, with some strong pajama armor. This is it right here. That reminds me, never use the Steam Workshop, use the Nexus. That's where the high quality stuff is found. I would only use the Workshop if the Nexus is lacking in the weird department. The Workshop has way too low of a size cap, so the Nexus has all the big mods."

fireemblemcasual,3drzee,ApatheticRadiance,2,Sun Jul 19 01:11:31 2015 UTC,"Alright, everybody. This is gonna get a bit personal. Basically, I've been dealing with some issues for the past...few years, honestly. Basically procrastination and internet addiction, and it all finally hit me for real a few months ago taking my exams for the spring semester (my grades were pretty terrible, by the way. All C's and D's, and I'm certainly not graduating in four years, I can tell you that). My grades were terrible, I was spending too much time on the internet, and Reddit is a major, major part of that. I'm seeing a psychologist and my parents are very supportive of me, so things are looking much better than they were a few months ago. However, we've decided for the time being that it's best to limit my internet/device time severely so I can focus on building strong habits and being less addicted, so basically I'm gonna get an hour of time each day for device usage. Yes, like all of it, so this means I can spend an hour on Reddit or 30 minutes playing Melee and 30 minutes on my phone or whatever, so I'm really not going to be around for the foreseeable future, apart from a comment here and there. I'm officially dropping out of the tag team I'm doing (paging /u/Tazerz1995, sorry buddy but it's for the best. This way you guys don't have to wait on me anymore, plus the BBD debate gets interesting again!) and I won't be posting anything in EPFE on the main sub for a while, although I may play a bit and build up a backlog for an eventual big update, who knows. Until then, farewell for now! (Sort of, I'll still be here, just very rarely!)"
fireemblemcasual,3drzee,Tazerz1995,2,Sun Jul 19 01:31:52 2015 UTC,"Damn man, that really sucks to hear, don't worry at all about the tag team stuff though. You got a lot of other things to worry about than something like that, I'm sure everyone understands.  I had no idea you were going through stuff like that, hopefully it gets better soon! Don't worry about having to do anything around here that would impede more important things like school and family, make sure you got all your important things sorted out should be the #1 priority, best of luck! Hopefully I still will be able to joke around with you here and on the main sub from time to time!"

These measures are kinda drastic but necessary, pretty much. Good luck with the tag-team and I'll try to pop in and remind everyone how Rangers such every once in a while!

Attack Stance and Guard stance are really balanced with different situations needing you either to go all out with Attack Stance or bulk up in Guard stance so you don't get bodied by the enemies. Character wise everyone is pretty well balanced with only a few standing out as really bad(Rinka, Ricken 2.0, Mozeme) and only Ryomu standing out as OP.

Windows 10 launches on the 29th. :P But I've got the insider preview thingy. Latest build is supposedly what will launch on the 29th. Mostly no problems. The previous build changed it so you can't differentiate between windows display language and default keyboard. So I couldn't have windows in English, but my keyboard be Korean so I could type in hangeul in games. That's my only disappointment. I should see if that was fixed. Othwerise, 10 is nice and fast. Finding things is easy, though I did have some experience with 8.1 beforehand. I'm probably in the minority, but I disliked 7's start menu. Couldn't find applications because they kept changing spots on me. So I like the metro extended thingy so I can put big icons to start applications. Microsoft Edge is... it needs more stuff. I dunno. It's fast, but default starting to Bing? At least now I can change that, but I already installed Firefox because I don't like ads."

And thanks for the description of 10, I hope that they fix that little issue for you soon but it sounds like I'll be good in using it when it releases which is what I was worried about. I thought that it released more towards the end of the month but I've seen a lot of people getting into the early release thing so I thought they might be releasing early to keep the download website from going down or being too slow."
fireemblemcasual,3drzee,ScionofMaxwell,2,Sun Jul 19 04:13:24 2015 UTC,"What we did was sorta sign up for Beta testing of Windows 10. Other users could upgrade to test/design their own software to make sure it would be compatible at launch. Microsoft is actually doing the opposite: they announced somewhere that the option to upgrade to 10 will be given to certain groups later than others. So Insider Preview people and those that purchase it will likely get first full Windows 10. Then the people who have 7 or 8, and I can't find where they said which group will get priority for when the update goes live."

fireemblemcasual,3drsst,hunterboyz24,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:02:10 2015 UTC,Exactly -__-
fireemblemcasual,3drsst,Bullwine85,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:04:11 2015 UTC,If it's any consolation the Bears are the NFC North rival I hate the least. That says more about the Vikings and Lions than it does the Bears lol
fireemblemcasual,3drsst,PyroCannon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:07:14 2015 UTC,"the Bears are the NFC North rival I hate the least   Wait a minute - you are a PACKERS fan, and yet this is the case? That right there tells me you aren't that familiar with the history between our teams. I mean, I hate the Vikings and Lions, too, but still... I despise the Packers FAR more than both those clowns put together. FTP all day, every day!"
fireemblemcasual,3drsst,Bullwine85,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:53:55 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know the history. That's why I have a grudging respect for the Bears even if I don't always like to admit it.  The Vikings are like an ex who is obsessed with you and stalks you endlessly.  And the Lions are like that kid down the street we always invite grudgingly, then he plays dirty and thinks they're the greatest thing all of a sudden and wonders why no one likes him."
fireemblemcasual,3drsst,PyroCannon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:58:42 2015 UTC,"OK, so I was wrong. And, similar to how you feel about the Bears, I can reluctantly respect the Packers. Fuck everything about my team being their whipping boys for almost every year between '92 and today (and regrettably there's more to come), but there are good things about the Packers. Ours is the prime rivalry of the NFL in my mind, and the two teams respect each other.  I share your sentiments toward the Vikings and Lions, though my hatred of the Vikings is probably not as potent as yours."
fireemblemcasual,3drsst,PyroCannon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:10:36 2015 UTC,"For all his faults (and there are many), Cutler is still better than every QB the Bears have ever had except for Sid Luckman and Jim McMahon. I'm not crazy about him, but I can appreciate the talent he does have - it's far better than the 20 years of god-awful quarterback carousels from the late 80s until 2009. He's still the best option the Bears have unless they draft a QB in the next few years, whether he sucks or not."
fireemblemcasual,3drsst,hunterboyz24,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:51:14 2015 UTC,Talent and brains are two very different things.
fireemblemcasual,3drsst,PyroCannon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:53:19 2015 UTC,"Of course they are. Cutler has plenty of talent, enough to be one of the NFL's best QBs. And while he is by no means stupid - you have to have some smarts to attend Vanderbilt and/or be a competent QB - his decision-making is mediocre at best, and sometimes just plain dreadful. Can the Bears do better than Jay Cutler? Absolutely. But unless guys like Andrew Luck start growing on trees, finding a better one is a bit of a crapshoot. Unless you have some damn good scouts who see things no one else does, as was the case when Green Bay picked up Favre and Rodgers.  So, if you no longer root for the Bears, who is your team of choice?"
fireemblemcasual,3drsst,Bullwine85,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:02:56 2015 UTC,The Wild aren't the same now that Cal Clutterbuck's with the Islanders.
fireemblemcasual,3drsst,Bullwine85,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:25:41 2015 UTC,"Still, they're a Minnesota hockey team. Screw 'em."
fireemblemcasual,3drsst,Bullwine85,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:36:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't care about them anymore now that they no longer have my favorite grinder."

I'm writing this through my phone's crappy 3G b/c I got a new wifi provider, which was nice until I found out that the wifi is 10x as worse as the old connection. I can't even connect for more than 5 minutes at the most before it cuts out, so now I have to temporarily drop out of the Pathfinder game I was in until I can fix the problem, which could go on for a long, long time. What's worse is that I can't even play music, use my mic (which is also having problems) and talk on Skype with my friends, or even talk above a loud whisper due to my annoying neighbors complaining after I let out a long, loud string of yells and curse words trying to get my wifi connection back. So then I got yelled at for a while and found out that I'll be in serious trouble if I make any ""loud"" noises and my neighbors (who I'm pretty sure absolutely hate me) complain again. To add insult to injury, I was so pissed off at the day that I got careless while cooking and burned myself while making ramen noodles. RAMEN NOODLES!  Hopefully tomorrow will be better..."

I noticed that USF4 was free to play this weekend so I'm gonna give it a shot despite not playing any traditional fighting games and I also poked my head into the USF4 stream at EVO and it looks so boring. Even Smash 4 at APEX looked more exciting than USF4 did. They just wiggled around and poked eachother 3-4 times and maybe got a cool grab. Compare that to Smash where everyone is always moving around and pressing buttons and hitting, shielding, grabbing all the time. I dunno, I'm still gonna try it out though.  EDIT: I popped back in after Melee was finished and some of the matches were pretty hype. Daigo vs....dammit I already forgot his name was pretty hype. Came down to last stock, last match, both super low and the other guy clutched it out right at the end. I guess Zangief v Vega is just a really boring matchup? I dunno."

fireemblemcasual,3dlhco,BloodyBottom,2,Fri Jul 17 06:23:29 2015 UTC,"I can't tell if this is a Megaman ripoff, a Pokemon ripoff, or a precursor to Custom Robo.  EDIT: Just looked it up, it's literally a reskin of Pokemon. Wow."
fireemblemcasual,3dlhco,BloodyBottom,2,Fri Jul 17 06:27:44 2015 UTC,"I saw an ad for it in Nintendo Power and I was like ""Pokemon and robots, sign me up!"" and what the fuck.

The only other things I remember is that magnets replaced Pokeballs but there were like 50 different kinds and I couldn't tell which did what and that everybody kept telling me that the championship battle that happened a while back was really suspicious. I didn't spend much time with it, which is part of my guilt."

Weird looking Niche Audience JRPG? basically has Atlas Published written all over it.  And yet, Atlus still published many great things for the states. Like Guilty Gear, Disgaea, and Demon's Souls."
fireemblemcasual,3dlhco,MindwormIsleLocust,2,Fri Jul 17 07:15:26 2015 UTC,"True. Though they were responsible for Virtual Hydlide coming to the west, so I'm not gonna say they've got 100% great ideas on what to publish."
fireemblemcasual,3dlhco,Blaze64,2,Fri Jul 17 07:24:45 2015 UTC,That's what makes them great though IMO. They'll take a chance with all sorts of strange games that might never see NA's shores otherwise.  Like Intelligent System's Magnum Opus: Cubivore

fireemblemcasual,3dlhco,ZeroKarasu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:31:57 2015 UTC,"It really was. That game was intense. I think it involved throwing stuff at each other?  Punky Skunk was actually pretty awesome. It was sorta like Mario, but with a skunk as the main character."

I've also been slowly chipping away at Sword Art Online over the last couple of weeks. It's okay. Unless it goes majorly downhill in the last five episodes I think I like the second arc more than the first. I hear this is quite the unpopular opinion.
fireemblemcasual,3dkrvf,pik3rob,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:54:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it is an unpopular opinion.

I also was sick one of the days. I also hit my eye really badly on the corner of the dresser in my room halfway through the trip, its k now though. Besides those things, would still rate the trip a solid 9.5/10.  Now I just can’t wait TO BE KIIIIINNNNGGGG (sorry, there was a Lion King show in the main live action theatre the last night, still have all the nostalgic songs of my childhood in my head to be able to sleep in my own bed now and I’m so glad I have access to my wifi, God, having only like 1 hour a day of internet down there was a struggle at times lol."

I am still incredibly mad"
fireemblemcasual,3dk02i,reignleire,2,Thu Jul 16 22:14:17 2015 UTC,What did they say?
fireemblemcasual,3dk02i,Chastlily,2,Thu Jul 16 22:17:53 2015 UTC,They apologized. I mean they knew what they did was wrong. They said they would just check it only every once in a while to see if I was doing okay.  But it still is messed up for them to do it

I was feeling really lonely but I didn't want to talk to anybody because I didn't want to be a bother. As soon as I came home I tried to sleep again, but that didn't help because I had another bad dream (of an entirely different nature) that made me wake up shaking with my heart racing.
