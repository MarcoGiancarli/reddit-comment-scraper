RelayForReddit,3dyoxv,thajunk,19,Mon Jul 20 18:20:21 2015 UTC,I agree. Submitting a post is harder than it needs to be.
RelayForReddit,3dyoxv,pogo_is_god,6,Mon Jul 20 17:15:03 2015 UTC,"I think it's because most users are much more consumer-y than producer-y. Keeping the action hidden from consumers makes sense, but it's hard to cater to producers at the same time, and perhaps this isn't the right place to hide the action? Dunno."
RelayForReddit,3dyoxv,matchu,3,Mon Jul 20 21:44:43 2015 UTC,They shouldn't have to hide it thought just make it intuitive to use.  Ignoring it is easy.
RelayForReddit,3dyoxv,veyronboss,5,Tue Jul 21 05:24:35 2015 UTC,"Kinda? If we give better real estate to this control, then something else has to lose that real estate.  Like, Chrome could put the Print button up by Back/Forward/Refresh, but then we lose space for the location bar and the other controls, and folks would misclick it. Some people print very often, but most people almost never print, so Chrome hides the control and requires an extra click to get to it. That's good design: users could ignore the print button they never use, but, this way, they don't have to.  It definitely makes sense to deprioritize submission relative to the controls that consumers use, though I bet there's a more intuitive place for it…"
RelayForReddit,3dyoxv,matchu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:30:32 2015 UTC,That's true.  If it were in the upper right corner of the menu you get when swiping from the left of your screen to the right that would probably do all of that.

It believe it happens sometimes with the proper dropdown but I haven't been able to reproduce for some miraculous reason.
RelayForReddit,3dyny4,humblargh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:47:19 2015 UTC,"The textbox appears in 3 circumstances: 1) when entering a sub from the menu in the left; 2) when manually typing in a sub; 3) when clicking on a reddit post which is itself a reddit post.  Doing this creates another ""layer"". The one with the drop down menu is the main window. This is ALWAYS open until you close relay. If you see a text box, that means you're on another layer. To get rid of it, simply keep pressing back until you get to the main layer (with the drop down menu).  The ""proper"" way to enter subreddits is to select one from the drop down menu. This allows you to stay on the main window."

RelayForReddit,3drwj9,connormxy,2,Sun Jul 19 12:59:55 2015 UTC,Short comments wouldn't need to change at all. The icons take up the entire height of the comment box anyway for single line comments. It really only would need to change for longer comments. It's a little frustrating to scroll back up through a long ass post trying to find the icons.
RelayForReddit,3drwj9,kushxmaster,11,Sun Jul 19 14:48:44 2015 UTC,Or double tap
RelayForReddit,3drwj9,Call_erv_duty,16,Sun Jul 19 00:27:45 2015 UTC,That's a good idea too but if you make it a double tap then that means the system has to wait after a single tap to see if there is going to be a second tap or not making the app a bit slower
RelayForReddit,3drwj9,Call_erv_duty,-1,Sun Jul 19 00:44:23 2015 UTC,True. Maybe two fingers at once for upvote three for down?

RelayForReddit,3drwj9,PERCEPT1v3,13,Sun Jul 19 03:59:43 2015 UTC,A much more logical fix to that would be to make the widgets that appear by swiping the cards always appear in view.
RelayForReddit,3drwj9,29083011397778,6,Sun Jul 19 04:21:53 2015 UTC,Agreed. This makes much more sense.

RelayForReddit,3drar1,MrSomalianCinema,22,Sat Jul 18 18:23:57 2015 UTC,I believe so. It's still worth buying the full version though. It doesn't cost all that much and helps support the developers of such a great app.
RelayForReddit,3drar1,StepW,4,Sat Jul 18 20:24:51 2015 UTC,I asked because I wasn't sure if I should buy pro version or just pay for the 'remove ads.'
RelayForReddit,3drar1,SGTxARTEAGA,13,Sat Jul 18 20:35:36 2015 UTC,I bought mine 3 years ago and haven't regretted it since and I never buy apps
RelayForReddit,3drar1,StepW,2,Sat Jul 18 20:48:23 2015 UTC,"Oh, I wasn't bashing you for not supporting the devs haha. Sorry if I came off like that.  The ads were kinda annoying for me anyway. I'm glad they're gone; it was very much worth the purchase."
RelayForReddit,3drar1,nrfx,5,Sat Jul 18 21:04:57 2015 UTC,I'd prefer to buy the pro version because thats what you'll automatically download if/when you sign into a new device.  If you do in the in app purchase you can't always transfer it to a new device.
RelayForReddit,3drar1,jaycent,3,Sat Jul 18 21:26:18 2015 UTC,I paid through the app and it appears to carried over to my new Android devices.
RelayForReddit,3drar1,piemur24,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:38:08 2015 UTC,"I need to recheck, but I was under the impression that not buying the ad free version was more profitable for devs. The ad revenue over the span of 2+ years per user would be more than $1.99.  I may be wrong, misread/misremembered the article, or things have changed, so don't take my word for it."
RelayForReddit,3drar1,StepW,2,Sat Jul 18 20:50:12 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the ads in this app only amount to any sort of profit if you click on them.

RelayForReddit,3drarw,Anonymoose9311,15,Sat Jul 18 18:24:13 2015 UTC,"That's just to signify a controversial comment; one that's been equally upvoted and downvoted.  Edit: That last bit's wrong and has been answered by more knowledgeable, less half asleep people."
RelayForReddit,3drarw,acciolube,7,Sat Jul 18 18:27:42 2015 UTC,"Like the other comment said, it's to show that a comment is ""controversial.""  But since I see this question asked frequently, I thought I'd give some background...  It used to be that you could see the number of upvotes and downvotes on a post. Reddit changed that a while back, and now you can only see the total.  They did this for... uh... ""reasons."" I think it mostly had to do with some system they put into place to keep new posts from being hidden too quickly with downvotes, but I don't really know.  However, the problem with this system is that a post with 3 upvotes and 0 downvotes (total = 3) looks exactly the same as a post with 2347 upvotes and 2344 downvotes (total = 3).  Those two posts are obviously not the same though. The first one is a relatively uninteresting comment. Whereas the second one is a very interesting, but controversial comment.  So that's why we have the little red cross. To denote those type of posts.  Honestly I think the whole thing is kinda dumb. They should just show the upvotes and downvotes if you ask me. If they have a problem with downvote brigading on new comments, they should just use that system where the votes are hidden for the first hour.  I've also seen some subreddits which don't have downvotes at all. Just upvotes. I think that would work pretty well too.  Either way, this ""controversial post"" thing doesn't work because half the people don't even know what it means."
RelayForReddit,3drarw,redditor1983,3,Sat Jul 18 19:59:38 2015 UTC,The thing to remember is the vote totals that res displayed were almost never correct. Like basically never right.
RelayForReddit,3drarw,kushxmaster,2,Sat Jul 18 21:30:03 2015 UTC,"When they showed numbers the numbers were almost never right. They are still not right, they are scaled I think.  Subreddits hide the downvote feature but it's still there if you disable subreddit style / use mobile clients."

RelayForReddit,3deenb,MTastatnhgew,21,Wed Jul 15 16:56:19 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell, this is a benign glitch so there's probably no need to fix it, but I find it interesting none the less. It only happens only on Relay, which is why I'm posting it here.  I've found a bunch of ghost subreddits where there are a bunch of posts, but every single one of the posts have 0 karma and 0 comments. The OP's username and subreddit doesn't appear next to the titles, and every post is said to have been edited 45 years ago (that would be 1970). For every post, there is neither body text nor a link, and the ""x percent like it"" field is blank.  Most commonly, I've found that the subreddits' names often come in the form of at least two words, each separated by either an underscore or a hyphen. Here's a list of the ones I've found:  /r/woah_dude /r/no_jerk /r/a_b /r/you_car (I tried using nonsensical words for this one) /r/too_soon /r/soon_too /r/too_soon_man /r/too_soon-man /r/45_years /r/instant-regret (/r/instant_regret already exists) /r/brandon_lee /r/the_beatles /r/james_bond /r/broken_arms /r/bad_animation /r/what_the_fuck_did_you /r/what_the-fuck_did-you /r/a_big_guy_for_you /r/a_big-guy_for-you    As you can see, most of these are made up of words commonly found together. For most of these, the underscores can be replaced with hyphens, and vice versa, and doing so won't change the content of the subreddit. Underscores and hyphens can even be mixed, as demonstrated by the last four.  Interestingly, all the post titles are titles of posts from other subs. I thought that maybe the posts are taken from entering the words into reddit's search engine, but the results from searching don't really match the posts on the ghost sub, no matter what search settings I use.  I've tried doing this on various other reddit apps, including Reddit is Fun, Baconreader, Flow for Reddit, and Sync for Reddit. I've even tried doing it on the reddit desktop site. None of them yielded similar results, so this is a bug exclusive to Relay.  Again, this glitch seems to be harmless, but I find it quite interesting, so I thought I'd share this here.  Edit: formatting"
RelayForReddit,3deenb,nudemanonbike,33,Wed Jul 15 16:57:53 2015 UTC,"I can explain the 45 years part. 1970, as you said, is when Unix time starts, so, if for whatever reason, the last edited field is empty on a post, reddit says the date was 0, or January 1st, 1970.  Normal reddit wouldn't bother listing this, but relay does."
RelayForReddit,3deenb,jk3us,10,Wed Jul 15 18:00:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured it was something like this. The variable for edited time was probably initialized and by default given a value of 0, and when it would have been changed to a different number, it retrieved no data for the edited date. By some bulletproofing to prevent Relay from crashing, it would have then kept the value from initialization, making it return the edited date as the epoch."
RelayForReddit,3deenb,raugturi,5,Wed Jul 15 18:13:20 2015 UTC,"It looks like any non-existent subreddit will return a list of subreddits as if you searched.  Relay is expecting a list of posts, so when it looks for certain fields it doesn't find them but tries to display it anyway.  See the return of https://www.reddit.com/r/woah_dude.json (it redirects to a subreddit search url)  I think the best solution would be to not have the redirect if using the json API, but that's a reddit change.  Alternatively, Relay might be able to detect the redirect (status 302) and show an error message instead."
RelayForReddit,3deenb,PointyOintment,3,Wed Jul 15 20:38:28 2015 UTC,"Also it looks like each item in the ""children"" array has a ""kind"" which is ""t5"" for subreddits apparently and ""t3"" for posts. So any t5s could be ignored. You wouldn't have any indication that it wasn't a real subreddit, but the list of posts would be empty at least.  But I think detecting the 302 status is still the best idea."

RelayForReddit,3cxbhd,ArttuH5N1,8,Sat Jul 11 20:49:02 2015 UTC,"From the top comment:  "" Copied from an earlier question: source /u/danby   For peppers, The air in the void mostly has the same composition as the atmosphere and the air got there largely by diffusion through the fruit's tissues as the fruit (and the space) grew bigger. With regards peppers; wild peppers are small and fairly packed with seeds, so there isn't a lot of space inside them at all. What space there is is present because, unlike their close relatives the potato and tomato they don't fill the cavity of their fruits with a liquid or gel. I'm not sure it is understood why chilli fruits don't also have a gel filling the fruit's interior but I would hazard a guess that it is likely to do with the fact that capsaicin (the spicy chemical) is not (very) water soluble. Coming back to the larger sweet or bell peppers, these have large interior spaces because humans bred these peppers to have large fruits with lots of flesh and clearly the mutations which were cultivated for these traits did not also increase the size of the seeds by the same proportion.  https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1ue4i9/the_air_inside_some_fruits_for_example_peppers  So I'm being original, here's what I get from it. The air inside a pepper is the same as the air outside the pepper. Kinda how water from the ground becomes the water in the fruit, the air around the plant diffuses into the air inside the gaps. """

The replacement of & with &amp; and back again is supposed to happen automatically. The fact that you are seeing it means there's a bug somewhere.  EDIT: I tested and verified the problem. When you first put the & into the post, it works fine. It's probably actually storing &amp; in the post, but you never see it, you just see &.  When you edit the post, that &amp; does not get converted back to just &. Now you actually see &amp; in the post.

RelayForReddit,3ckt01,Saellyn,36,Wed Jul 8 18:08:49 2015 UTC,A solution I thought of would be to add a color wheel instead of specific colored themes.
RelayForReddit,3ckt01,GldRush98,5,Wed Jul 8 19:37:27 2015 UTC,It has been suggested many many times before. I'm guessing there is some reason why this isn't a simple implementation. It would be nice for dbrady to respond to the inquiry though
RelayForReddit,3ckt01,De4dSpace,12,Thu Jul 9 04:09:15 2015 UTC,/u/DBrady what is you stance on this subject?  I've asked about a color picker / hex editor before.  Defining different account colors would be useful too.

RelayForReddit,3clo6s,SirPribsy,-4,Thu Jul 9 13:17:55 2015 UTC,To show my disapproval of how things are being done here and granted I myself haven't been here long but even to me the content seems a bit watered down of late and Voat seems to be more content driven like a younger reddit. I'll still be here probably because of habit and how it will be difficult to get everything I like about reddit somewhere else.
RelayForReddit,3clo6s,casuallylatedan,9,Thu Jul 9 13:27:48 2015 UTC,"interesting... I've been around for awhile, and I feel like all of this fiasco is a flash in the pan. Heck, I'm almost completely insulated from it as I only have a few default subs and I don't ever visit /r/all... I think there are still a ton of well moderated and valuable subs. But maybe that's why I don't get the desire to leave... I'm just not part of those communities that are feeling affected.  Not to mention, some of the recent celebrity/political AMAs that Victoria helped with have seemed very watered down with big questions being avoided. Not sure who's to blame there and clearly the way it was handled was extreme and public for something that could've been handled internally."

Or maybe mods have the ability to change the default sorting method of comments?  EDIT: For instance when I go here (https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/3cizr4/servers_are_up_kinda_rocket_league_server_status/), the comments are sorted by new.

RelayForReddit,3cexq9,SquareWheel,14,Tue Jul 7 11:28:25 2015 UTC,It would be really useful. Sometimes I'm annoyed by the hidden scores thing because I usually just mindlessly browse reddit and with hidden scores I actually have to think and form an opinion of my own. It's weird that in a way I feel I've been indoctrinated by the hive mind. I wish it wasn't but as soon as I see a negative score the comment more likely to be seen in a negative light than me. And comments with a quite a few down votes I outright ignore them.
RelayForReddit,3cexq9,EFlagS,5,Tue Jul 7 13:28:16 2015 UTC,"This is one of the things that's really wrong with reddit.  Many times, a highly upvoted comment seems like the ""correct"" opinion/response."

Scores are hidden, order of comments is randomized, no mimimum karma threshold for display."
RelayForReddit,3cexq9,Se7enLC,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:22:27 2015 UTC,"Do you still want it to be sorted by ""Top""?   I use Best, which is a much more intelligent sorting algorithm.  It's still biased of course, though Top is much too favorable to older comments.   And the lowest rated will still be hidden by default.   You can actually disable vote thresholds in your user preferences.  I know there's still bias by sorting by anything other than random (via contest mode) or chronologically, but I'm willing to take the tradeoff of a bit of bias for generally better quality comments.  It still blinds me for comments replies, and anything that's not a ""top comment"" really."

It has also gotten to the point all the main subs seem to be in somebody's pocket and deleting posts that have over a thousand upvotes. r/news keeps deleting any news about the tpp because it is political despite 99% of news being political. Reddit Inc also fired everyone that didn't move to California which also seems dumb.

RelayForReddit,3bzwfp,greengrasser11,7,Fri Jul 3 16:03:58 2015 UTC,Please explain. You can already collapse all the parent comments on a thread. What do you mean?
RelayForReddit,3bzwfp,Limp0r,14,Fri Jul 3 17:14:56 2015 UTC,For the best example I'll refer to the reddit desktop site. You can click the little minus sign to minimize a whole comment chain including the parent comment of that chain.  On Relay you can tap a parent comment but it will only collapse the child comments underneath it.   This is particularly problematic when navigating through topics that have very lengthy parent comments.
RelayForReddit,3bzwfp,cheami,8,Fri Jul 3 17:19:50 2015 UTC,Doesn't really solve your problem but makes navigating easier. In the options you can turn on navigating with volume buttons. Pushing volume down will jump to the next comment
RelayForReddit,3bzwfp,Limp0r,-8,Fri Jul 3 17:39:03 2015 UTC,"What lol? You can't honestly think pressing a physical button on the side of the phone is anything remotely close to collapsing the parent comment through normal touching.  One is actually collapses, so that rules your idea out 100%, as opposed to just navigating. And two, it is a physical button on the side as opposed to the already position of your finger on the screen....  I don't understand how this is even considered an alternative."
RelayForReddit,3bzwfp,JonnyBhoy,7,Sat Jul 4 08:03:28 2015 UTC,Wow calm down! The butthurt is real. I just gave a tip but if it's too hard too move your finger to the side of your phone and pressing a button instead of scrolling down a long ass comment do yourself a favor and use the desktop site.
RelayForReddit,3bzwfp,TheCreat,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:21:09 2015 UTC,You can also simply press the red compass icon and use those arrow buttons to skip to the next parent comment.
RelayForReddit,3bzwfp,mickymicky1,3,Sat Jul 4 10:26:07 2015 UTC,"I really hate that on the desktop site. I habitually collapse comments after reading them, but I still want to see that level. So if anything it should only be an option..."
RelayForReddit,3bzwfp,JulienIsDaMan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:16:45 2015 UTC,Download RES and just click on hide child comments
RelayForReddit,3bzwfp,rikardo_92,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:05:17 2015 UTC,"Ooo, how do you do that?"
RelayForReddit,3bzwfp,JulienIsDaMan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:13:27 2015 UTC,Press the blue circle when you open a thread (the one that shows the number of comments and says collapse beneath it).
RelayForReddit,3bzwfp,mtmv2,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:54:13 2015 UTC,Thanks!
RelayForReddit,3bzwfp,nosut,6,Fri Jul 3 21:24:13 2015 UTC,For what it's worth the fact that collapsing works differently on Relay is one of the primary reasons I like it over Sync and the other clients. It makes it easier to tell comment threads apart and decide if you actually want to expand them and read them.  Your issue is why the comment navigation arrow buttons are there. You can use them to jump to the next parent comment.
RelayForReddit,3bzwfp,mtmv2,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:49:19 2015 UTC,"That does not help when you want to collapse maybe the top second level comment without the rest of the second level comments collapsing.   If there is a second level comment that is a giant wall of text I would like to be able to not see it.   Thats how reddit actually works so the app should at least be able to do that as well.  The arrows would bring you to the next top level comment.  Collapsing the ""parent"" comment does not mean a top level comment. It just means the comment that you are on that may have nested comments below it."
RelayForReddit,3bzwfp,nosut,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:17:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I see what you mean. I suppose maybe like a tap and hold to ""minimize""/completely collapse a comment into just a small card with the user/points/time, while retaining the current tap to collapse functionality, would be best. And maybe a setting to flip the two if you'd rather one be your primary or quicker action.   I really love the comments section of Relay and I think it's what puts it head and shoulders above other clients, but adding the functionality you're suggesting wouldn't hurt. Plus the tap and hold action does absolutely nothing in comments right now anyway."
RelayForReddit,3bzwfp,nosut,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:22:10 2015 UTC,I could get behind that. Honestly I wouldn't even mind having it be the long action just as long as it was allowed.
RelayForReddit,3bzwfp,SliderUp,2,Fri Jul 3 21:29:38 2015 UTC,I have to agree. When I am looking at comments and suddenly there is a wall of text I would like to be able to just not have to see it at all. I dont want to collapse everything under it.   Parent collapsing should be the way to go.   Thats how reddit actually works.
RelayForReddit,3bzwfp,kiwihead,2,Fri Jul 3 21:14:15 2015 UTC,"No! Never! I hate the apps that collapse the top comment as well. You lose your position, especially when you collapse in the middle of a long comment. Hate."

RelayForReddit,3byj65,abqnm666,-14,Fri Jul 3 07:03:25 2015 UTC,So childish.
RelayForReddit,3byj65,excaliburxvii,11,Fri Jul 3 10:28:18 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. Things have been near the boiling point between the people who are in charge, admins, and mods for quite some time. But out of nowhere, an admin is suddenly fired, with no communication or plan in place to take over an important function of the community, it caused things to boil over.   Let's relate it to app development. You work for a company as a programmer, under the direction of a lead developer and project manager. This person is the only one who knows how to and has access to do a number of essential functions. And one day, you come into work and your lead developer wasn't there. And when you asked management about your lead's absence, the boss just shrugs her shoulders and doesn't say a word. And without your lead developer, you can't publish your critical app update because the lead has the password and there is no recovery process. And again you go to the boss and again she just shrugs her shoulders and doesn't say a word. And on top of that, your boss had the IT department remove the period and semicolon keys from your keyboard, but then decides to fire you because you didn't use any periods in your emails.   How do you fix this? How do you get your boss to communicate with you? What is the contingency plan? Who is going to do the job of your lead developer? How do you overcome management that's seemingly crippling your work intentionally even to the point where your job is at risk?   The point is that communication was coming in two forms. The unanswered communications to management, and then the seemingly arbitrary and random directives communicated by management. But those directives still never answered the questions sent to management. And there was no way to clarify anything, rules were being changed without notice, mods were being banned and subs closed for violating rules, even though the mods don't have sufficient guidance in how to enforce the ever changing interpretation of the rules. Nor do they have the proper tools to be able to moderate in accordance with the rules.   It's just a big shit show. Nobody up top was listening, so to get their attention, you make it hurt. Making some of the most popular subs private and taking away traffic, ad revenue, and probably sending many users off to never return seems to be the only way to effect change within the organization.   Yes, as users it sucks. But hopefully it leads to a stronger community that has management that works together with admins and mods to improve the site, not try to destroy it and drive it into the ground."

It's a hobby for those people at most, not a job, so they've got nothing to bargain for except access to the site, and they've taken that from themselves (At least the subreddits they mod.) When you're an adult and something is some bullshit (And let's be real here, won't be fixed. Those mods are 1000000% replaceable.), you quit and move on. The end. But when you're 14 and/or autistic, everybody has to bend to your will. But hey, good luck with your guys' white knighting. And I'm sorry to have hurt your feelings enough for you to try insulting me - I never said anyone would care if I left, but if I'm about to leave, I'm probably not the only one.

RelayForReddit,3bum8v,brian047,15,Thu Jul 2 07:44:34 2015 UTC,I had to turn inbox notifications off for this issue. I'll be on reddit on my desktop and be actively talking in threads and 15 minutes later my phone starts buzzing like crazy.
RelayForReddit,3bum8v,realmenlovecats01,12,Thu Jul 2 09:25:28 2015 UTC,"This is my #1 complaint for Relay. I have to force quit the app or silence my phone every night before I sleep, otherwise it will wake me up with constant notifications. Sync does not do this, so I hope it will be fixed."

RelayForReddit,3bum8v,PerfectLogic,6,Thu Jul 2 13:11:18 2015 UTC,Yes because its good? It's an alarm. Not exactly a complicated app.
RelayForReddit,3bum8v,PARTY-PETE,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:09:29 2015 UTC,"I haven't had an actual alarm clock in years now.  Always use the stock alarm app on all the Android phones I've had.  It works great, I don't know why you'd need any other one"
RelayForReddit,3bum8v,BackToTheFuturama,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:19:40 2015 UTC,Because I sleep very hard and have a tendency to turn off alarms in my half-woken state and then I'm screwed for waking up on time. I started using an app called I Can't Wake Up Alarm Clock and it has so many features to customize and ways to make it hard to snooze or turn off the phone that I've not had a problem since.
RelayForReddit,3bum8v,PerfectLogic,2,Thu Jul 2 17:01:38 2015 UTC,That one is fantastic.
RelayForReddit,3bum8v,ZapTap,2,Fri Jul 3 17:23:37 2015 UTC,"The only thing I don't like about the stock alarm is that it starts ringing at full volume from the start, while in sleep as Android it goes gradually from low volume to high volume, much more subtle and enjoyable.  Other than that, they are the same, it's an alarm as any other..."
RelayForReddit,3bum8v,-Rivox-,2,Thu Jul 2 16:09:21 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. I've been using an app called I Can't Wake Up Alarm Clock that is extremely customizable. I wake up to the sound or song of my choosing (I sleep like a coma victim, so I've found loud metal works the best to wake me) and it let's me have the option to gradually raise the volume also. Best of all, it includes the option of setting tasks to turn the alarm off or snooze it. Things such as having to do math problems, match a pattern set or even scan a chosen barcode to turn it off. Nothing gets you out of bed and in the shower quicker than having to scan the UPC on the shampoo bottle to shut up the alarm. Lol."
RelayForReddit,3bum8v,PerfectLogic,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:40:07 2015 UTC,"Priority mode works with many, but not all, alarm apps. And you can always set a manual exception for an alarm app that doesn't use the stock API.   I use Timely and it works just fine without any need to change anything. And it even triggers the alarm icon in the status bar like the stock alarm does."
RelayForReddit,3bum8v,abqnm666,8,Fri Jul 3 02:43:35 2015 UTC,"Add me to this. Has been happening for ages, just never said anything because I figured I set something up wonky. Knowing it's an app issue has me now seriously considering uninstalling.   (edit) I'm now thinking it must notify on every mail check if there's unread mail,whether there's new messages since last check or not. How about an option to notify on new messages since last check, is that possible?"
RelayForReddit,3bum8v,BakedWatchingToons,3,Thu Jul 2 12:49:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what it should be doing. Currently I think it makes a new notification every time it checks mail, regardless of whether or not it's notified for that message already.  This also means that it gives you a notification again after you've dismissed it without reading it."
RelayForReddit,3bum8v,SheeEttin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:08:34 2015 UTC,Same experience here too. I have now turned off notifications altogether.   RedReader is providing backup notifications and then I open Relay.
RelayForReddit,3bum8v,AnanthaShayana,3,Thu Jul 2 19:38:48 2015 UTC,It's even more annoying when you have a smart watch.
RelayForReddit,3bum8v,eegras,2,Thu Jul 2 13:47:23 2015 UTC,Yeah its always been like that for me... mildly annoying.
RelayForReddit,3bum8v,lodc,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:36:34 2015 UTC,Yup. Annoying.   Now I have to slide the notification away mark it as read to stop the ringing and then later hopefully remember that I had a notification and check my messages myself.
RelayForReddit,3bum8v,AmorousEyes,2,Thu Jul 2 15:48:59 2015 UTC,"Sliding it away does nothing,  it's just goes off again in 10 minutes for me.  I have to open the app so It sees it as read."
RelayForReddit,3bum8v,KingPhoenix,2,Thu Jul 2 16:10:34 2015 UTC,"It's even worse for mods.  I can't even use it to monitor the modqueue, because it keeps nagging me until I take action on everything in the box.  I'd really love to see /u/DBrady give some sort of response on this thread.

RelayForReddit,3bum8v,saltyteabag,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:19:38 2015 UTC,"Me too. Very annoying. I was at a work lunch and my phone kept buzzing in my pocket but I didn't want to take it out and check in the middle of conversation and and seem rude. Finally it had gone off so many times I thought surely there was an emergency or something that I needed to check on. So finally I took my phone out and nope, one message in my reddit inbox."
RelayForReddit,3bum8v,if_ewe_only_gnu,0,Thu Jul 2 18:27:40 2015 UTC,"Relay checks mail every x minutes as defined in your settings. To stop it from checking when relay is not open, go into Settings > Mail, and uncheck the box ""Check outside app."""
RelayForReddit,3bum8v,reichbc,3,Thu Jul 2 17:48:35 2015 UTC,I am aware of that setting. I want Relay to check for mail all time even when I am not using it. I don't want it to re-notify me about notifications already in the status bar.
RelayForReddit,3bzbnj,KneeGrowBlack,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:56:16 2015 UTC,I think that has to do with your sort by preferences on reddit itself. Try changing it in preferences -  comment options and see if it has any effect in the app
RelayForReddit,3bzbnj,BakedWatchingToons,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:04:30 2015 UTC,it don't think it has anything to with that. I have used other apps that have this option (readit for windows phone). I also looked for that option on the reddit site and couldn't find it. Thanks for the quick reply!

It happens about 1/3 of the time I edit a post. As soon as I tap save, my keyboard closes, but there is just white space where the keyboard was and the app is completely frozen. Only since the latest release (7.77) have I noticed this. The edit usually does actually save, however.   What's annoying is that for some reason, even if I let it sit for ten minutes, I don't get the ANR box, so I don't have a way to submit the crash log. And then I have to go force close it manually."

It notifies you more than once if you don't check it or get to it initially, over and over.

RelayForReddit,3b291r,gollyzila,12,Thu Jun 25 20:23:47 2015 UTC,Doesn't android just do that implicitly? I don't know if this is still the case but it used to be that when you rotate an app it's reloaded in its new form. (I was told this by an app developer I know who may not have been the brightest)
RelayForReddit,3b291r,doomsday1216,18,Thu Jun 25 12:11:45 2015 UTC,"I believe so. AFAIK android devices don't really rotate, but regenerate the view when you tilt the phone."
RelayForReddit,3b291r,pipechang,26,Thu Jun 25 12:19:42 2015 UTC,"This is correct, but the developer has ways to prevent the reloading of webview containers. No doubt you've seen this done elegantly before in other android apps. Relay has received this feedback numerous times..."
RelayForReddit,3b291r,omrigold,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:40:14 2015 UTC,Sync had it set up not to reload the page. That's one of the only things I like about sync.

RelayForReddit,3b291r,w00z,6,Thu Jun 25 18:03:30 2015 UTC,Nope. Sync For Reddit is a different app.

RelayForReddit,3b291r,w00z,8,Thu Jun 25 18:23:26 2015 UTC,Relay for Reddit used to be called Reddit News.
RelayForReddit,3b291r,meatee,2,Thu Jun 25 18:42:25 2015 UTC,Reddit Sync became Sync for Reddit. Relay for Reddit uses to be called Reddit News. Then Reddit or Google said something along the lines of apps can't use the name of a website or whatever as their first word in their name unless they are the actual website owners making the app. Sorry if that's confusing lol.
RelayForReddit,3b291r,kilo_x88,3,Thu Jun 25 18:45:08 2015 UTC,"Reddit decided that third party devs can't call their app ""reddit something"".

RelayForReddit,3b291r,11235813_,7,Thu Jun 25 18:08:18 2015 UTC,There are ways to solve this...
RelayForReddit,3b291r,Gnascher,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:32:13 2015 UTC,It's not that simple because of how Relay works.
RelayForReddit,3b291r,GldRush98,-3,Thu Jun 25 20:51:23 2015 UTC,One reason could be many mobile websites have a different layout for landscape vs portrait.
RelayForReddit,3b291r,BaconIsntThatGood,6,Thu Jun 25 13:00:52 2015 UTC,Possibly but I can't imagine any website that would take such a small difference in width into account.   If it DID take it into account then it would update anyway because that's just how media queries work.
RelayForReddit,3b291r,Tech_Romancer,6,Thu Jun 25 13:56:10 2015 UTC,"It's called Responsive Web Design and that's exactly what it does. Scales with every pixel of width and height (easily tested by resizing your brower on desktop) and usually they have specific design changes for Desktop, Tablet landscape, Tablet portrait, Smartphone landscape and Smartphone portrait sizes."
RelayForReddit,3b291r,AetherMcLoud,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:08:10 2015 UTC,"Yes but I can't imagine very many devs writing media queries for the difference between a landscape and a portrait mobile. And any other difference for a responsive site is going to be minimal at best, just scaled to the wider screen.   Maybe for tablets I see the use case of making the landscape layout drastically different.   In any case even if they had a hundred media queries the browser itself would resize the page elements automatically when the change in width is detected. It wouldn't require page reload.  Edit: for tablets there is definitely a use case, I'm still not entirely sold on a landscape mobile specific design."
RelayForReddit,3b291r,Tech_Romancer,2,Thu Jun 25 16:27:12 2015 UTC,The design changes are mostly for menus and text/image adjustment anyway. For example you might have a normal menu on smartphones' landscape mode on top of the page but in portrait mode it changes to a single dropdown menu for size reasons.  It's mostly built in into wordpress and other CMS systems' templates these days anyway and you simply need to make the graphics and layout for it. And AFAIK it's mostly a javascript library so there shouldn't be any new queries just by resizing - so this shouldn't be why Android reloads the whole page upon switching orientation.  I just wanted to call out that it's almost a standard nowadays with wordpress or Typo3 everywhere and lots and lots of templates.
RelayForReddit,3b291r,AetherMcLoud,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:06:36 2015 UTC,"It's not a small difference on most devices. On my Nexus 6 it is 1440 vs 2560. The Nexus 5 is 1080 vs 1920. The Nexus 4 is 720 vs 1280.  Depending on how sites are set up, going below certain widths can trigger mobile views. I've seen a few set at 1100 pixels, which means both the Nexus 4 and 5 would trigger the regular view instead of the mobile view when rotated to landscape (assuming they aren't already forced to mobile due to the user agent)."
RelayForReddit,3b291r,bassmadrigal,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:35:37 2015 UTC,A CSS pixel is not the same as a screen pixel.   Otherwise you'd be viewing desktop sites on a nexus 5 landscape.
RelayForReddit,3b291r,Tech_Romancer,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:44:11 2015 UTC,"You can use JavaScript to determine the window resolution to decide what layout to provide to the browser. On sites that don't use the user agent to force mobile, I've had sites switch from mobile to regular when I've rotated my phone."
RelayForReddit,3b291r,bassmadrigal,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:49:22 2015 UTC,Good point. It just re-renders though didn't it? It doesn't request the data again.
RelayForReddit,3b291r,FlappySocks,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:44:00 2015 UTC,That isn't the problem. Most mobile websites have stylesheets which automatically adjust to changing viewports. And the others will still look the same if the viewport changes without being refreshed.  The 'problem' is in the system architecture of android: the browser and comments are so-called interface 'fragments' inside an activity. Whenever the phone is rotated the viewport changes and android dumps the current layout of an activity and recreates it for the new viewport. If the activity just contains a browser (or 'webview') you can just retain the current instance and repaint with a little jump. But to get the comments and browser into a single activity they are stuffed into fragments (which have their own lifecycle). So when the screen rotates it seems to be a problem retaining the webview instance (or loaded page') because the layout containing the webview isn't just repainted with new dimensions (as would be the regular use case) but replaced completely. (As evidenced by the new location of the comments/browser divide).

My first purchase was Power Manager Full (lol) and I bought Relay/Reddit News on 12/29/11.  Neat!  Edit: Relay is by far the purchase I've used most on all my phones combined! I'm sure it works out to fractions of a cent spent per hour used at this point.

RelayForReddit,3ay1d5,Bigdaddy_J,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:04:02 2015 UTC,You do know there is more than just Android and Apple?  My question was posed because the vast majority of the time carriers have mms size limits. So pictures normally get compressed to potato quality when coming out the other end.  Hence sending a link that allows the other person to see the picture/gif/video in the same quality is much more useful to the majority of people.  Not to mention depending on where the picture/gif/video are coming from might have problems with you downloading their content and sharing so they do not get the page views. If Relay for Reddit started doing that I am sure they would hear about it fast.

Personally, I think it's fine as is. It doesn't immediately look wrong to me (from the screenshot alone I had no clue what was wrong), and scrolling the entire sidebar seems like it would be unintuitive, especially since we're moving the button you just pressed :/"

RelayForReddit,3anawe,AlecRobertson,6,Sun Jun 21 22:15:03 2015 UTC,The only way I know is to mark it as read in your notification drop-down. But yeah it's pretty annoying.

RelayForReddit,3ame7y,Eggplantsauce,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:18:58 2015 UTC,If you have reddit gold you can add a note to each friend and Relay will display it in app. You have to add the note on the website for now though:  https://www.reddit.com/prefs/friends/  That's the closest to what you're looking for for now.
RelayForReddit,3ame7y,DBrady,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:18:08 2015 UTC,Thanks for the workaround. Do you plan on adding a tagging feature in the future?
RelayForReddit,3alnb9,rauldzmartin,3,Sun Jun 21 12:44:37 2015 UTC,Can you check your settings-> accessibility in your phone settings and tell me what services are active? Some of them can interfere with Relays animations.
RelayForReddit,3alnb9,DBrady,2,Sun Jun 21 15:50:01 2015 UTC,Same problem here.   Moto X 2014 and have Moto Voice and Tasker services enabled. Turning them off doesn't seem to change anything though.

RelayForReddit,3ajw0o,PERCEPT1v3,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:19:29 2015 UTC,There's still problems with this method. You can't copy anything from the comment and you need to reopen it any time you want to compare something.  It would be nice if it worked like a messaging app where the comment is above the reply box.
RelayForReddit,3ajw0o,RichardGG,2,Sun Jun 21 01:06:46 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's really easy. Click the quote button or just highlight it and copy to clipboard."
RelayForReddit,3ajw0o,PERCEPT1v3,3,Sun Jun 21 01:08:33 2015 UTC,"Can't highlight and copy, at least on my phone. The copy controls are behind the dialog box.  Quote feature works, but is not ideal for large comments."
RelayForReddit,3ajw0o,RichardGG,2,Sun Jun 21 01:21:11 2015 UTC,"No, when you click Reply on someone's message and then Advanced, you can click the little comment box icon (it's to the right of the Format drop down menu) and it shows the comment you are replying to. Just hold on that, pull the little arrows around to copy the whole text and paste it into your comment you are typing."
RelayForReddit,3ajw0o,CarbonCamaroZL1,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:25:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's what I'm referring to. http://i.imgur.com/p9ck7G4.png  On stock Android, the copy button is on the action bar, which in this case is behind the dialog box.  (Google is changing to a floating copy button on Android M though)"
RelayForReddit,3ajw0o,RichardGG,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:39:57 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I see what you mean.  Okay, well before you hit reply, you can always slide right on the comment, click the triple button icon and click Copy Text. Then go into Advanced and paste it there. It should pop up a PASTE option above the comment reply if you hold down on empty text space for a second or 2."
RelayForReddit,3ajw0o,CarbonCamaroZL1,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:59:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's similar to just pressing quote, but that's quite annoying if you're replying to a long comment, so much more text to delete.  IMO the current reply system could really use an overhaul, having the comment directly above and maybe a proper rich text editor would make it far more usable."
RelayForReddit,3ajw0o,RichardGG,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:10:21 2015 UTC,If you highlight some text in the comment and then press quote it will only quote the highlighted text.
RelayForReddit,3ajw0o,DBrady,3,Sun Jun 21 06:11:57 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately it brings up the keyboard, which hides the button. If I dismiss the keyboard it removes my selection.  Is the keyboard meant to pop up?"

RelayForReddit,3ajahd,th3fallenon3,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:47:18 2015 UTC,Couple solutions:   Swipe the post to from right to left and tap the view comments button.   Or you can set it to only ever open in the internal player instead of the YouTube app.
RelayForReddit,3aj0ro,Nidorosity,3,Sat Jun 20 17:44:01 2015 UTC,Video player would  be so much better if we could minimize it like in youtube app

RelayForReddit,3ai17x,philloran,3,Sat Jun 20 11:04:13 2015 UTC,I saw this posted a day or two ago with regard to ampersands. Probably would be a good idea to compile all symbols affected in one place.
RelayForReddit,3ai17x,ZapTap,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:04:31 2015 UTC,Or just fix the one bug that causes all of the symbols to do that.

RelayForReddit,3aflgw,dhamon,41,Fri Jun 19 19:01:53 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree with this. It doesn't happen all the time but occasionally I find myself trying to scroll through a website and it brings me back to the subreddit page.

RelayForReddit,3aflgw,michaellicious,27,Sat Jun 20 17:54:28 2015 UTC,This is the only thing I find truly aggravating about the app. It gets me a lot when I'm scrolling a subreddit one handed and it brings up the navigation side bar.
RelayForReddit,3aflgw,piggahbear,5,Fri Jun 19 19:49:52 2015 UTC,Oh my God I thought I was crazy. Glad to know other people are experiencing this issue.
RelayForReddit,3aflgw,Goofy117,24,Sat Jun 20 01:26:30 2015 UTC,"What. The browser and comment section acts as if the two pages lie side by side with the main view, when you accidentally swipe back those two pages are still there completely unchanged, just click the link again and they come back as if they literally were a piece of paper that's just been put aside.  I love the sensitivity, because there's no downside to sweeping back except having to click to reenter. Make it less sensitive and you'll strain my thumb, please no."
RelayForReddit,3aflgw,hrkristian,31,Fri Jun 19 20:18:49 2015 UTC,"It is mainly a problem if you follow a link from outside Relay, from the browser or twitter, into a comment page. One little sideway movement when scrolling and you are back in the browser. Clicking the link again, most often after getting rid of the empty tab the browser has opened, will take you to the top of the comment page again."
RelayForReddit,3aflgw,sugarshark,6,Fri Jun 19 20:30:03 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, that one I definitely agree with, but that shouldn't affect the main Relay app. Instead dbrady should just remove the swipe function from the Link and Comments overlay specifically.   With Links and Comments it's a bit out of place to have swipe-closing on Android as closing an overlay like that is usually reserved for the back button, and even then being able to purge with the back button is also bad design without a confirmation dialogue."
RelayForReddit,3aflgw,hrkristian,6,Fri Jun 19 20:52:13 2015 UTC,"It doesn't always save your spot if you're reading the comments section, though. I'd call my personal success rate about 70%"
RelayForReddit,3aflgw,ZapTap,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:00:27 2015 UTC,I agree with you. It's perfect in m  eyes. Maybe a slider so we can keep our glorious sensitivity and the casuals can have a lower one?
RelayForReddit,3aflgw,doomsday1216,6,Sat Jun 20 00:49:50 2015 UTC,"You can disable it in the settings. Settings>Behaviour>Swipe back from comments.  Then Swipe back from website is right under it.   I disabled it because I agree, it's way too easy to swipe back and lose your place."
RelayForReddit,3aflgw,memaw_mumaw,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:50:21 2015 UTC,I think this is the best solution. Personally I don't feel like anything of value is lost with the missing swipe back
RelayForReddit,3aflgw,LonelyNixon,2,Sat Jun 20 07:12:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. That being said for stuff like slideshows or pages where you need to scroll that require a right swipe, just move your finger slightly up or down and then right. If you move in any other direction first, it disables the ""swipe right to go back"" gesture."
RelayForReddit,3aflgw,ghpowers,2,Sat Jun 20 01:49:03 2015 UTC,"Many users complain about this (and I agree). Unfortunately to date, nothing has changed about it."

Using it the freezes are much less frequent for me.  I also run a Nexus 5 with 5.1 Lollipop and don't see the corruption issue. Are you running a custom rom?

For the first time, I am experiencing issues with the gallery viewer crashing. I just submitted a crash report. I will continue to submit reports if I encounter additional issues.  To be clear, I was not experiencing any issues until I joined the WebView beta and upgraded. If there's any additional information I can provide to help you identify the source(s) of the issue, please let me know.  Quick edit: I was browsing the gallery at http://imgur.com/a/p0qH4 (the link was posted in /r/woodworking today). The application hesitated as I swiped from image 3 toward image 4. Image 4 was not visible during the crash, maybe just a sliver of it had appeared (the swiping animation was still happening). For what it's worth, I viewed the post earlier today without issue. I may be misremembering, but I didn't think the post linked to an album this morning (I only looked at 1 picture). That is what caught my attention and the reason I bothered looking at the link again. After recovering from the crash, I was able to view the full album without issue. I hope this extra information helps in some way!"

I also get two kind of crashes now, the first where it informs me it crashed and then immediately owns the app back to where I was, which up until a month ago exclusively happened.

RelayForReddit,39ujtk,eoinster,9,Sun Jun 14 22:16:56 2015 UTC,"The problem is currently the app doesn't separate what you've been alerted on from what you've read. So when it checks in with Reddit, if you have unread messages, it treats them as new messages and thus notifies you again.

RelayForReddit,39fszj,erhbg16,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:33:42 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. I was wondering if it's possible to create a post and upload a picture while doing so. For example, I have an android issue and want to show Reddit what I'm talking about so took a screenshot.   I think you answered it though. So there 's no way to do it in-app? I have to upload to Imgur and then copy the link and go back to Relay and then post the link?"
RelayForReddit,39fszj,frankxanders,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:05:16 2015 UTC,"Well, you have to host images elsewhere to post on reddit at all.  You could use the imgur app to upload the image, then share it, and choose Relay with the share intent.   I don't use the imgur app, but if its a ""just once"" or ""always"" sharing mechanism, I think it could be set up to work pretty quick."
RelayForReddit,39fszj,erhbg16,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:15:15 2015 UTC,Cool. I'll try that so. Thanks!  It'd be a nice feature to implement in a future version if possible.

Edit:    sync for reddit: same as relay  reddit is fun: uses tabs.   baconreader: individual dropdowns side by side (both subreddit and sorted-by label get cut off with longer text)  Now for reddit: just a button (text is hidden)  IMO, design choice both in Relay and Sync look best."

RelayForReddit,39d1oi,AZBeer90,2,Wed Jun 10 23:10:15 2015 UTC,"Posts are not actually hidden until you hit the big red button. The button moves all of the currently displayed read items to your hidden items list, and hence they don't come back.   I personally don't think this is the best way to implement this feature, but it's what we've been given.   The problem is that you first read the posts, and continue scrolling. Then later you've refreshed and all these read posts are still there (although they're a different colour, so you know they're read) so you click the big red button and they all disappear (and are moved to your hidden items list). As you continue to scroll more read items continue to appear, so you keep clicking the big red button.   Then, the NEXT time you refresh, you don't see them, except of course you still see the items you read on the previous pass through the list, you know, the ones you read AFTER clicking the big red button.   Of course, if you then think you'd like to see one of those posts you saw earlier you can refresh the list and you'll see the ones that you read on your previous pass through the list, but not the ones from the pass before that (because you'd click the big red button and they're now in your hidden items list).   BTW, does anyone know if the Search function will return items in your hidden list? (I haven't checked).   I'd prefer to have an on-screen toggle that hides read posts before I see them (ala gReader) , and if I toggle it off they reappear when the screen is refreshed. This should work like the old function of the big red button, just without having to click the big read button."
RelayForReddit,39d1oi,SeaChangr,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:44:25 2015 UTC,"I imagined that was the case, but if so it's terribly backwards. I mean, shouldn't the button already do that?"
RelayForReddit,39d1oi,eydryan,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:21:13 2015 UTC,I finally figured it out like you did. I also don't care for this implementation. I want ALL the read threads to be hidden every time I refresh so I DON'T have to hit that red clear button. I was hoping this new setting was going to be saving me some steps.

I'd need to see a mockup to be sure, though.  Really, though, the subreddit entries look fine to me. I think what's bothering us is that the non-subreddit entries are styled identically. I'd want a divider if it weren't for the fact that they can be sorted elsewhere in the list… maybe bold?"

RelayForReddit,394tjr,thouliha,37,Tue Jun 9 11:58:04 2015 UTC,"That's a terrible idea.

RelayForReddit,394tjr,GeorgePantsMcG,9,Tue Jun 9 14:05:27 2015 UTC,That's how Sync for Reddit use to manage it but it made it awkward for some users who have smaller hands to reach it. I really like how it works in Sync now where you just tap on the comment and a little bar pops open at the bottom of the post and you vote. It makes voting on longer posts easy. You get to the bottom after reading and then just tap it to vote.  It's the only feature from Sync that I miss.

RelayForReddit,390k0p,wholypantalones,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:56:36 2015 UTC,"I posted this comment to another post, but thought it might be more useful here.....   The option to permanently hide read posts is great, I've been wanting this for months, buuuutttt...... This implementation is not great.   Posts are not actually hidden until you hit the big red button. The button moves all of the currently displayed read items to your hidden items list, and hence they don't come back.   The problem is that you first read the posts, and continue scrolling. Then later you've refreshed and all these read posts are still there (although they're a different colour, so you know they're read) so you click the big red button and they all disappear (and are moved to your hidden items list). As you continue to scroll more read items continue to appear, so you keep clicking the big red button.   Then, the NEXT time you refresh, you don't see them, except of course you still see the items you read on the previous pass through the list, you know, the ones you read AFTER clicking the big red button.   Of course, if you then think you'd like to see one of those posts you saw earlier you can refresh the list and you'll see the ones that you read on your previous pass through the list, but not the ones from the pass before that (because you'd click the big red button and they're now in your hidden items list).   BTW, does anyone know if the Search function will return items in your hidden list? (I haven't checked).   I'd prefer to have an on-screen toggle that hides read posts before I see them (ala gReader) , and if I toggle it off they reappear when the screen is refreshed. This should work like the old function of the big red button, just without having to click the big read button."
RelayForReddit,390k0p,exitflow,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:23:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think what you're asking is feasible with the current Reddit API. What if, for example, you had read ten pages and you refreshed. I'd need to download the first ten pages again before i found some that were not read. That would be 10 requests at between 1-5 seconds each depending on network conditions and a lot of wasted data. Unless reddit implemented something on their end where you could request unread posts i don't think it would work well."
RelayForReddit,390k0p,indy_14,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:55:20 2015 UTC,"I hadn't considered the timing issue, but unless reddit itself imposes some sort of limit on page downloads, I'm not sure it's really an issue.   Firstly, it wouldn't be a problem on highly active subreddits, or on a user's frontpage (unless they've only subscribed to very slow subreddits).   With the current behaviour (without enabling the option to permanently hide the posts) the work flow would be something like this: Refresh, click Big Red Button  repeatedly 10 times until something unread stays on the screen, Or for users who don't use the Big Red Button: Refresh, Scroll, Scroll, Scroll, (wait for more posts), Scroll, Scroll, Scroll, etc for 10 pages.   I expect the ONLY time the suggested implementation would be a problem is when ALL of the posts on a new page have been read. In this instance the user would see a delay, but maybe a simple onscreen message would solve the problem:  Looking for unread posts... Page 1  Looking for unread posts... Page 2  Etc"

Both have this issue, but at least with relay the last viewed post stays highlighted and doesn't have to reload when you click it. As for the browser, I simply turned off the swipe to close feature for it, so I just swipe up to get to the comments and then swipe right to exit the post.  The swipe only working from the edge would help, but I would settle for a swipe on only the action bar taking me back, and not on the comments section or browser at all."

Though if you load the comments page from a link (ie from a Google search) when you ""exit"" via swipe you leave the app entirely and there's no going back, it has to reload..

That area is generally used for settings and more next level stuff in most android apps.

RelayForReddit,38rmhg,x3knet,3,Sat Jun 6 05:34:04 2015 UTC,Only reason I like relay better is because you can use gestures to switch back to the front page and to switch between the link and comments. I would say just try the free versions of both apps for awhile and pick which one you prefer.

RelayForReddit,3803qr,whizkid72,3,Mon Jun 1 03:37:52 2015 UTC,I'm starting to think this through some and I think there are some design considerations to discuss.  If the content is a video this makes a ton of sense. A picture also makes sense. If it's an image gallery then we need a good way to control scrolling through the images. Maybe leave a small portion of the device screen as a track pad for scrolling?  Would users want to read a text article on the TV screen? I think my personal preference would be to have that sort of content still be on the hand held device.  Does this inspire more thoughts and considerations? Could be a cool feature if the developer can get it just right!
RelayForReddit,3803qr,locohygynx,3,Mon Jun 1 22:44:01 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this too. Maybe there could be an optional comment browsing mode which uses your phone as a controller. Or it could just mirror everything. Not really sure, a lot to consider."

RelayForReddit,37tmf9,Awake00,7,Sat May 30 09:28:49 2015 UTC,"Yes please, this needs to be changed.  Why is the default view not full view? If I click to see an image, I want to see that image!  I bet most people don't even use any of those buttons."
RelayForReddit,37tmf9,kataskopo,4,Sat May 30 14:25:23 2015 UTC,"I for one do use the share button to text things to friends ever so often and the comments button to head straight there with a simple click...but like I said those are secondary options and not the most important things upfront. The most important thing that you need working is seeing the full picture on click. These secondary options should pop up only with a double tap, swipe in a direction, long tap, etc.  So I'd still like these options since I use them, but they need to be hidden until you prompt them up, because the quick view mode is simply for that: quick viewing without any obstructions or things blocking the view. Having these buttons and bars in the way and overlapping pictures from the get-go defeats that purpose."
RelayForReddit,37tmf9,Severian427,13,Sat May 30 13:47:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is highly annoying.  IMO the Fenix twitter client has found the best way to implement this. Here's how it works:   simple tap on thumbnail: open full-screen image (obviously) when full-screen: simple tap on image: show/hide legend and buttons double-tap on image: zoom in/out (actually it cycles between 3 levels of zoom: fit to screen -> zoom 1 -> zoom 2 -> back to ""fit to screen"") (you can also zoom via the usual two fingers gesture, of course) long press on image: exit full-screen swipe image up or down when the image is not zoomed in: exit full-screen   It may sound a bit complex when explained like this, but it's really well thought IMO. I particularly love the ""swipe image up or down"" to close it, which feels really intuitive. (So much that I often find myself trying to use it in other apps. :) )  (edit: formatting)"
RelayForReddit,37tmf9,Severian427,9,Sat May 30 17:03:35 2015 UTC,I'd rather switch the long press to be the one that shows/hides the legend and keep the simple tap on exiting the image like it is now. The one click tap is too convenient to exit out of what you're looking at and I wouldn't have that changed.  Give the long key press function to the legend popping up.
RelayForReddit,37tmf9,Ximitar,2,Sat May 30 16:33:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know, my fear would be that will all those gestures, an accidental simple tap would happen too easily, which might be frustrating.  Like I said, I think this system works really well in Fenix. And as an alternative for the long press, you also have the slide up or down gesture (when the image is zoomed out), which I now use constantly, so it's really not a problem IMO."

RelayForReddit,37tmf9,pitchbend,3,Sat May 30 14:05:57 2015 UTC,The most jarring thing about this was seeing the screenshot with the bars and then my bars on top of those bars...I almost had convulsions...  Agree that this should not be visible by default. Its especially annoying when looking at screenshots of people's phones because they often are the same exact resolution.

RelayForReddit,37tmf9,SyanticRaven,4,Sat May 30 12:53:16 2015 UTC,"That is a ""fix"" that isn't really a fix but more of a misdirection to the real problem.  And there are some images, like this one that I took, that aren't scrollable and full size already with the phone screen with these bars in the way. So then the only ""fix"" for it once again would be to zoom into the whole picture and navigate through the enlarged version to read text and view the picture or reopen it in full view/browser mode. That's not a fix, that's settling for the only thing possible."
RelayForReddit,37tmf9,brajpop,1 point,Sat May 30 13:43:07 2015 UTC,"Also when you scroll down and it goes away, it doesn't come back when you swipe to the next picture in the album.

RelayForReddit,37q5y3,DBrady,6,Sat May 30 06:45:42 2015 UTC,"I like them, however there are a few constraints when creating the splash screen to make it work on all screen sizes.  It needs to be a 9patch so it can stretch to fill all the available space. This means you need a vertical strip with stretchable content on either side of the logo so it can stretch to the screen width. You also need a horizontal strip above and below so it can stretch to the height.  As they currently stand the circles would end up being elongated."

At the end of the day, it is my largest contributor to battery drain. This is fairly recent for me too, as ive had the app for a while now. Yesterday Relay Pro contributed to about 25% of my drain, and had the Mobile Radio active for over 5 or 6 hours. My Screen On Time was close to 3, and was about 11% of my drain.   Right now ive had 2% drained from my 58 minutes of Screen on time, and 11% from 12 minutes of CPU total but 3 hours of Mobile Radio Active from Relay. I unplugged my phone from the charger about 5 hours ago."

RelayForReddit,37kgqq,redalastor,1 point,Thu May 28 15:27:54 2015 UTC,"It's an Android bug which Google has yet to fix.  In a nutshell, when Relay for Reddit stops using your mobile connection, the antenna stays active and drains your battery and stays that way even in the background until you force kill the app."
RelayForReddit,37kgqq,redalastor,1 point,Thu May 28 19:25:06 2015 UTC,"I use Greenify to kill the App, it's while I'm using it that I see the battery drain. It just drops like 2 percent in 10-20 minutes which I think is a little crazy"
RelayForReddit,37kgqq,redalastor,1 point,Thu May 28 19:41:00 2015 UTC,It also drains while the app runs. If you download content for a total of 30 seconds while using the app for 10 minutes it's 10 minutes of drain while it should be 30 seconds.

RelayForReddit,37k0hn,DBrady,2,Thu May 28 12:05:00 2015 UTC,Well for instance if you were just collapsing the comment to get to the next thread then maybe clicking the down navigation arrow might be an equal/better alternative?

RelayForReddit,37jaj7,DBrady,1 point,Thu May 28 01:35:05 2015 UTC,The button doesn't hide things permanently. It only hides read links on the currently loaded batch. If you don't want to see links again you need to swipe it to the left and press the hide(x) button. There was a request in /r/redditdev recently about adding a batch hide function which would allow me to give the option to permanently hide all read articles. As it is now i'd need to make an api request for each individual link and at a rate limit of 1 request every 2 secs this could take 40s if there were 20 articles. Unfortunately there was no reply to the batch request.

RelayForReddit,37clvb,redalastor,1 point,Wed May 27 22:55:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the problem with that is those game threads usually have a very bulky main comment, so you have to go up and back down through that every time."

RelayForReddit,3741kc,Silent3sniper,9,Sun May 24 18:00:28 2015 UTC,"I really can't see how the app could block them without possibly possibly breaking legitimate sites. It's functioning just how opening the link up in the browser would. Blame the link, not the app."
RelayForReddit,3741kc,casuallylatedan,0,Sun May 24 22:47:16 2015 UTC,"I agree, but that wouldn't be a big problem as long as the setting is opt in. For example allow the browser only to display the content of the initial link or disable scripting like noscript for Firefox (PC)."
RelayForReddit,3741kc,TomEnom,8,Sun May 24 23:17:04 2015 UTC,"At some point, I think relay will need to switch to bundling the browser component for pre-lollipop devices since their's doesn't get updated and so is becoming progressively more insecure."

RelayForReddit,372u4j,Gsfgedgfdgh,3,Sun May 24 09:58:22 2015 UTC,Yes it does.

RelayForReddit,372u4j,fordred,1 point,Sun May 24 14:49:50 2015 UTC,I think they do because there are blocked porn subreddits  in Saudi Arabia but I can view then in relay
RelayForReddit,372u4j,momoa1239,1 point,Sun May 24 15:24:28 2015 UTC,Yes there is an option at preference area to enable SSL security for your account. I think every users should enable that button to have excessive security. Even every website owner who has SSL should make SSL enable on every page of the website. I have recently shared an article on Always-on SSL which gives securer experience to the users.
RelayForReddit,372op9,doge-chaser,1 point,Sun May 24 08:20:05 2015 UTC,"Well, I had suspected that.   Thanks for solving the question. I had just created a new thread asking about it."
RelayForReddit,371ctg,rdyoung,2,Sat May 23 23:14:44 2015 UTC,"Maybe you added an unnecessary space at the end when you typed it, many android keyboards do that and the app won't filter it properly."
RelayForReddit,371ctg,ParaspriteHugger,3,Sat May 23 23:33:06 2015 UTC,Nope. I use the filter option from the little menu.
RelayForReddit,371ctg,ParaspriteHugger,2,Sat May 23 23:46:06 2015 UTC,Then I'm clueless.
RelayForReddit,371ctg,ParaspriteHugger,2,Sat May 23 23:59:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its beginning to get a bit annoying. There are a few sub's that refuse to die, this being the biggest annoyance. I have a filter list a mile long and most stay gone, its odd, like a prank pulled by the Dev on purpose."

RelayForReddit,36z1b3,Sol_Invictus481,1 point,Sun May 24 01:00:30 2015 UTC,Can confirm. This happens to me too. Another Solution is to just hit back and come to the thread again.

RelayForReddit,36zs5o,amorpheus,4,Sat May 23 21:52:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you need 3 steps to get to it. It's quicker to just click on the post and come back. A one step gesture would be perfect."
RelayForReddit,36zs5o,Margravos,2,Sat May 23 21:57:56 2015 UTC,1- swipe to left  2- press the dots  3- click mark as read   More steps than just clicking on the post and press back. That's my point.   A long press and multi select could also be great to mark multiple post at once.

RelayForReddit,36ypco,aerobroken,1 point,Sat May 23 15:44:56 2015 UTC,"Oh I guess it is an antiquated scenario huh? :)   It was more of just an as-is choice, and everything from a regular phone perspective has been working fine to current date... I did look at a lot of the custom roms on XDA to update the device for at least ICS but there were some features that were never resolved and so I took my losses and accepted the phone's final OS fate.  I've had my mobile device for almost 5 years now (Sprint - US Network, Motorola Photon 4g) and haven't had any major concerns since I generally use the phone for voice + sms. General web browsing with firefox beta/inbrowser/PDF-kindle reading works fine/Home LAN-media-video streaming, Wi-Fi tethering with VPN are all good... even Bitcoin too! I can still edit documents and take use of a BT keyboard/mouse if needed to do more in-depth work on the fly. It's fairly powerful enough for me and often replaces my regular PC/laptop on many things...   I still enjoy reading android news and try to stay up to date on things I am looking for or just to be aware... For some sanity however, I do have a nexus 7 2012 tablet with root + lollipop 5.1.1 and do enjoy the more formal and respectfully updated/developed-app counterparts... I will be updating to a new phone this year (still debating on some specs and conveniences for what will be on Sprint in mid-late 2015).  Ultimately, it was my mistake for not backing up the relay for reddit/reddit news apk... At the time of this thread post, I just made sure to double check and back up all the apks to my cloud and other storage areas from my device to avoid a repeat situation.   I suppose it's a good example reminder to anyone else ever finding themselves in a situation like this to back up your most used and favorite apps!"
RelayForReddit,36ypco,frankxanders,2,Sat May 23 19:04:13 2015 UTC,I see. Well I was gonna offer to send you a phone but I don't have anything for Sprint unfortunately.   I just hate to see someone stuck on a 5 year old version of Android.

Great thing from a software perspective with our OS is how we can still hang onto things if really needed!"

RelayForReddit,36rt39,kataskopo,4,Thu May 21 18:10:34 2015 UTC,"There's already an app for that, at least on Android! It's called Offline Reddit or something like that, very customizable, although you can't interact in any way with the on line post, you can't upvote or save or anything, but it caches posts and images."
RelayForReddit,36rt39,Linux_Man85,2,Fri May 22 06:16:54 2015 UTC,Oh that would be awesome! Be able to browse cached reddit comments during boring classes!
RelayForReddit,36rt39,moronmonday526,2,Fri May 22 05:32:03 2015 UTC,Yup. I recently tried to cut a PDF of a great post with every comment expanded. The PDF came out to be 188MB. There has to be a better way.

I was trying to put it up on Google Play Books first so I could download it to and delete it from my tablet as much as I want. I have the HTML/full version. I also tried to convert it to an ePub using Calibre but my laptop rebooted to apply an update in the middle of the conversion and I have yet to restart it.   Would still like to have RES offer to export a post and all comments to multiple formats the way Wikipedia does. I know Reddit wants to keep some of the high comment count features to themselves, but still. I can want :)"
RelayForReddit,36q9pz,gravitysabitch,6,Thu May 21 07:10:15 2015 UTC,"Reply to the comment or post, go to advanced and there press on the reply button at the top and there you can select or also edit the text. It's intended for quoting but of course it can be used for copying the text and so.  It's not as quick or simple as long pressing on a comment and selecting the text but it's a good workaround"
RelayForReddit,36q9pz,Schnabeltierchen,7,Thu May 21 09:35:20 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately the quoting thing doesn't work at all for comments longer than a few lines.

RelayForReddit,36igcm,TheCheesebal,13,Tue May 19 17:22:44 2015 UTC,You can. This is how I change subreddits on lollipop
RelayForReddit,36igcm,ds8k,11,Tue May 19 19:24:07 2015 UTC,On lollipop you can also hold down the subreddit at the top of the page to do this.    Edit: I am on 5.1 Nexus 5.
RelayForReddit,36igcm,k_uger,16,Tue May 19 19:33:56 2015 UTC,Not on 5.0

RelayForReddit,36igcm,JustAwYiss,1 point,Wed May 20 11:43:16 2015 UTC,Believe it's because lollipop changed something that they then fixed in 5.1

RelayForReddit,36igcm,mtmv2,28,Wed May 20 00:12:30 2015 UTC,"If you have pre-5.1 lollipop, you can do this by holding the refresh button.   If you have 5.1, you can once again do it by holding the sub list.  If you can't do either of those, it's a bug."

RelayForReddit,368qp3,ThePa1eBlueDot,2,Sun May 17 11:37:47 2015 UTC,When I subscribe from my pc I still get the feed from the subs but they don't show up in my list. So kind of the opposite problem for me haha.
RelayForReddit,368qp3,AngryItalian,3,Sun May 17 16:14:08 2015 UTC,I think it's because the app makes a distinction between being subscribed to a sub and having it appear in your drop down list of subs.

RelayForReddit,369siq,thouliha,3,Sun May 17 16:02:36 2015 UTC,"I really like this idea, but personally, I'd rather it was based on left/right rather than top/bottom"
RelayForReddit,369siq,PatPatTheMarauder,1 point,Sun May 17 16:52:51 2015 UTC,I like the idea but then again it breaks the dynamic of the whole app (always swiping left to get into details) and as far as I remember the long press as such is not recommended anymore in the material design guidelines. And how will this work on long comments?
RelayForReddit,369siq,mvbeust,3,Sun May 17 20:39:09 2015 UTC,"Its much easier to vote on long comments, because the top 50% is an upvote, and the bottom 50% is a downvote.   Its actually harder currently to up/downvote on long comments, because you have to scroll to see the controls."
RelayForReddit,369siq,mvbeust,4,Sun May 17 20:49:03 2015 UTC,I agree that the current implementation is not optimal. That's why some people recommended showing the tools at the position of the swipe. This would the solve the scrolling problem.
RelayForReddit,369siq,PatPatTheMarauder,4,Sun May 17 21:08:14 2015 UTC,"I recommend downloading flow for reddit just to see how amazing the voting works. Its unmaintained, but the voting works at least twice as fast as on relay. No swiping then pressing, just a simple press and hold."
RelayForReddit,369siq,PatPatTheMarauder,3,Sun May 17 21:12:13 2015 UTC,How is this better? If I wanted to upvote something I'd have to scroll to the middle regardless.

RelayForReddit,368pri,rydgeback,1 point,Sun May 17 15:34:32 2015 UTC,I have this problem with responsive sites that have code snippets - the text boxes are almost always scrollable.
RelayForReddit,368pri,racei,1 point,Sun May 17 18:32:20 2015 UTC,"It's just not possible with some content. I often read programming related articles. They are mobile friendly, but actual pieces of code can't be wrapped or you can't read them anymore. So you have to scroll those parts (usually inside a ""code"" box for every snippet). There is no perfect solution to this, I'd say scrolling is necessary here."
RelayForReddit,368pri,TheCreat,3,Sun May 17 22:12:51 2015 UTC,Often if you scroll right slightly before scrolling left it will scroll in the browser window without swiping back to the post list.

RelayForReddit,364bdw,itsmeaku,3,Sat May 16 00:30:24 2015 UTC,This started a few days ago for me. Have a couple more people in a thread on r/galaxys6 that are seeing it too. I notice it most when using the volume keys to navigate through comments. Scrolling normally is silky smooth but it goes choppy when using the volume keys. Maybe it was an update that caused it because it was fine on my s6 up until recently.  Tried clearing the app cache and data. Still happens.
RelayForReddit,364bdw,Thrussst,2,Sat May 16 01:04:15 2015 UTC,"I've had this from day one as well. The animation is very smooth up until the last few frames before the comment disappears.

Move the rest of the options that are currently there with the swipe reveal to a long-press menu. It'd also interfere with swiping back to the post list but you could have that be swiping from the edge, and voting be swiping from the center of the comment.   This maximizes the interaction types with a comment (currently long-press does nothing). It also makes it so that you can vote and access comment options from anywhere on a comment even if its a longer one."

RelayForReddit,35tyj5,HGMIV926,2,Wed May 13 15:10:10 2015 UTC,"This is an issue with the way android handles text rendering.   For performance reasons android creates a texture atlas (a combination of most/all static images) when any app is first started and uploads it to the GPU memory. Any places these images are displayed can then be handled without much overhead by rendering a rectangle with the corresponding part of the texture atlas as it's texture. This is very fast and way more efficient than rendering images on the CPU. As rasterizing text is relatively expensive android will often create a texture atlas containing single letters and then render text on the GPU the same way it would static images - by drawing textured rectangles.  The problem you have in your screenshot is then caused by some sort of corruption in this texture atlas, which in turn causes the renderer to simply draw opaque rectangles instead of textures (in this case letters).  I have personally only ever seen this happen in relay, but I have no idea what causes it as I have a completely stock ROM and normal app code should not do anything to these data structures.  The easiest fix for users is to simply force android to recreate the necessary texture atlas by completely closing the app (force close/clear from recents) and reopening it ;)"
RelayForReddit,35tyj5,Hofferic,2,Wed May 13 23:50:47 2015 UTC,Are you using custom fonts or a custom rom? I had the same problem ages ago... Like 2 years or so. I had custom fonts and cyanogenmod. Don't know how or why but it went away. Rebooting usually solved it temporarily.

RelayForReddit,35mvh9,ProfessorPurple,1 point,Tue May 12 02:38:24 2015 UTC,But why? I haven't updated Android since last March. Why would it all of a sudden start happening now?
RelayForReddit,35mvh9,ProfessorPurple,1 point,Wed May 13 20:55:33 2015 UTC,Are you on 5.0+? Google is updating webview via the play store on all devices running 5.0 or later. So it is possible that you have received an update through the play store. According to the article I linked Google has found the problem and is rolling out a fix.
RelayForReddit,35l4vf,DBrady,19,Mon May 11 11:49:01 2015 UTC,"They're the same. Relay was released before in-app purchases were available, that's why there's two. It was the only way to do it. They have the same features and always will. I might try and come up with a better qualifier than 'pro' as it does kind of imply it has more features."
RelayForReddit,35l4vf,Ursenaem,7,Mon May 11 17:23:10 2015 UTC,"I believe there is a way to use an app as an 'unlock key' for a premium version of the standard app. Sleep as Android, and JuiceDefender do this."
RelayForReddit,35l4vf,TheCreat,3,Mon May 11 17:33:05 2015 UTC,"Lots of apps do this, including nova launcher, titanium backup and many more. The problem is that you can't easily migrate from the current model to the key model: current 'pro' users would have to install the free version when that is converted to a key, but wouldn't have any way of accessing their data/settings. Apps can't access data from other apps, even when they're from the same developer. In addition, KitKat/Lollipop introduced further restrictions on accessing the sd card (or general storage) making other conversion schemes problematic as well."
RelayForReddit,35l4vf,Ursenaem,1 point,Mon May 11 18:58:44 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer, I'm not a developer but I'll give it my best shot at giving my ideas.   In a new Relay Pro update, make a link to install the normal app from GP.  In the same way that those apps check for the 'unlock app', can they not pull data from other apps? So you can keep the data from the pro app to use with the normal app.  If not, can you sync your app data with your Google account to be later synced with the normal app?"
RelayForReddit,35l4vf,kabili207,1 point,Mon May 11 19:11:50 2015 UTC,"Apps can actually share data if the sharedUserId attribute in the manifest of both apps are the same (and signed using the same key). The problem is that once the new ID is set, the apps no longer have access to the data that was stored in the old IDs.  So not only would pro users lose their data, free users would lose their data too."
RelayForReddit,35l4vf,LurkerPower,15,Mon May 11 21:46:43 2015 UTC,"According to DBrady, they are two routes to the same end.  No difference."

RelayForReddit,35ih4o,tamrinkhan,0,Sun May 10 18:29:11 2015 UTC,I'm not the Dev... but you are clicking the 'link' from your profile. You aren't specifically targeting the comments. It makes perfect sense that it opens the YouTube app and I doubt he will change it. This is like clicking a reddit link in your browser and expecting it to take you to the comments instead of what is linked. Perhaps it could be made as a setting... but then it would likely happen for all links coming from your profile  (YouTube or not).
RelayForReddit,35ih4o,tamrinkhan,4,Mon May 11 13:39:24 2015 UTC,But when I press on a comment on my profile I'm pressing specifically to see that comment and the context of it - not to see the video. I can just open that when I'm in the comment section.   It would just be nice with a setting that stopped YT links from opening automatically.

RelayForReddit,35k5hk,87linux,1 point,Mon May 11 03:34:18 2015 UTC,You can set this in your reddit account preferences on the website. The API should respect this setting so it should work on Relay too after you change it.
RelayForReddit,35i8su,mrord1,1 point,Sun May 10 17:10:40 2015 UTC,I actually came to this sub to see if this was possible. I used to use Alien Blue when I had an iphone and I got so used to groups and multireddits that now I'm feeling lost without them.

RelayForReddit,35i8su,mvbeust,1 point,Tue May 12 01:03:35 2015 UTC,The only reason why I didn't find them was that I forgot to sync. Not used to something not syncing automatically anymore.
RelayForReddit,35ibwg,PutThatCatDown,3,Sun May 10 17:37:24 2015 UTC,You can't edit then but they're there. When you look at the subreddit dropdown your multireddits will be there with a tiny m indicating then.

RelayForReddit,35g01t,G-lain,2,Mon May 11 02:30:21 2015 UTC,I'm using version 7.65. I believe that it's the latest.   I just tested it with this post. It doesn't let you discard what's written using the back button. That's pretty much what I asked for. It doesn't ask any questions but that really doesn't matter. As long as it saves me from retyping the text that's what matters.   I could have sworn that I'd lost one very recently. Maybe the feature came with the most recent update?   Now if I can get the other app I use frequently to do the same....

RelayForReddit,35f3sl,MasterCommando,2,Sun May 10 01:04:39 2015 UTC,"Same problem here, I have the Pro version as well, and I'm also not logged into an account.  I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and that fixed the problem temporarily, but it never refreshed/updated after the reinstall.  It's not the best solution anyways as I had to go through the hassle of setting up all my subreddits and settings.  EDIT:   T-Mobile Sony Z3   Android 4.4.4   App Version 7.65"
RelayForReddit,35f3sl,Rick_250,2,Sun May 10 01:09:50 2015 UTC,Just go to the app page on your phone settings and clear the cache. Annoying as hell but better than reinstalling.

RelayForReddit,35f3sl,Rick_250,1 point,Mon May 11 00:33:34 2015 UTC,Yeah Relay is great. This bug is very new.   Too bad this app doesn't have a proper place to report and monitor bugs and their status.  /u/DBrady seems to ignore many of the posts here which is a shame because they are about bugs that make this app unusable even for people who paid money for this app.

RelayForReddit,35dufm,specialmove,4,Sat May 9 10:52:50 2015 UTC,"I have this issue all the time and it persisted after switching phones. My theory is that this doesn't affect everyone because people tend to use Reddit differently. I do browse the subreddits I subscribe to but most often I browse /r/all which is only bearable with a very robust list of filters. Subsequently I have a lot of subreddit filters. When first firing up R4R everything works fine for a while but after a bit of scrolling the filters are no longer applied. AdviceAnimals starts leaking and it's all downhill from there.  I also make liberal use of the button to hide read links. I don't know if that is contributing to the problem or not. I do really wish there was a way to mark a link as read in fewer steps, even if it were optional in the settings. Or maybe I need to browse Reddit differently and am the only one not getting with the program."
RelayForReddit,35dufm,FuzzyLogic01,3,Sat May 9 14:22:46 2015 UTC,"I had this happen the other day, but it hasn't been a recurring issue on my G3 and Nexus 7. All I did to fix it was log out and back in."

RelayForReddit,35a692,Flelk,4,Fri May 8 12:04:10 2015 UTC,It uses a coarse location for more targeted ads for your local area. Device ID use to be used to get a unique ID to track ad clicks. Google have recently introduced a specific Advertising ID so i'll check with the various ad networks on whether i still need this permission. I have a feeling it may still be needed as the app is also on the Amazon app store which doesn't have access to Google play services and hence the new Advertising ID. Since these are related to ads the permissions are not in the Pro version on the store but if you remove ads in the free version they won't be used either.

I launched it, I saw the icon, we have a splash screen confirming that yes we launched Relay. All is good. Anyway, the icon is very often the primary source of identification for apps.   We got ""Relay"" because reddit's client licencing asks that 3rd party apps to ditch ""reddit"" as their primary name (Reddit News, Reddit Sync, etc) to better help users in differentiating official from unofficial. They suggest ""for reddit"" or ""a client for reddit"".   This naming scheme and all things related to the alien logo are covered under the reddit licensing wiki page.

I once read that many app makers with a free and a pro version don't put ads in the free primarily to make money, but to 'annoy' users enough that they buy the pro version. Ads really only work to make enough money if a) your userbase is truly massive (Relay has ~100.000 downloads, I'm talking millions here) and b) the ads are obtrusive, so it's harder for people to ignore them. Relay has neither, so the developer is probably not getting rich of ads."

RelayForReddit,314hed,applesjgtl,21,Wed Apr 1 22:58:43 2015 UTC,"The dev has clarified on this.    The splash screen isn't a splash screen in a traditional sense. It's a loading screen that is always there when you open an app, any app, that  doesn't already have a instance running.Try G+ or Gmail for example. Swipe it away from recents so it's fully closed. When you open it again you'll briefly get a white screen which is the equivalent of the 'splash' screen I have. I just decided to put an image in it for something to look at rather than looking at a blank screen. You won't see it when resuming the app either. Only from a cold start. Just wanted to clear that up.In saying that if enough people hate it I'll remove it but it doesn't add any extra loading time.   Personally I think it looks cool and hope it stays.

UI elements that might change. If you include elements that might look different when the app finishes launching, users can experience an unpleasant flash between the launch image and the first app screen.  If you think that following these guidelines will result in a plain, boring launch image, you’re right. Remember, the launch image doesn’t provide you with an opportunity for artistic expression. It’s solely intended to enhance the user’s perception of your app as quick to launch and immediately ready for use.
