MHOC,3e754i,SeyStone,5,Wed Jul 22 14:40:15 2015 UTC,"Once a superior official opposition coalition emerges, we'll consider giving way. For the foreseeable future, this government will continue."
MHOC,3e754i,can_triforce,3,Wed Jul 22 14:50:13 2015 UTC,"Question Number One, Mr Speaker."
MHOC,3e754i,HaveADream,5,Wed Jul 22 13:56:16 2015 UTC,"As you rightly point out, Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister is away today and so I've been asked to reply. This morning I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others. In addition to my duties in the House, I shall have further such meetings later today."
MHOC,3e754i,can_triforce,3,Wed Jul 22 14:09:58 2015 UTC,"Mr Speaker,   How does the Prime Minister think he and his coalition has any legitimacy as the Government, when they are conceding on Opposition Policy of 2% of GDP, despite his continued insistence that it is a pointless target, and when his government is giving up, and just agreeing with Opposition Education Policy.   Added to the fact that very soon the Opposition will outnumber the Government, how does he think he has any legitimacy or mandate?"
MHOC,3e754i,demon4372,4,Wed Jul 22 14:07:54 2015 UTC,"I'm proud of our decision to increase defence spending to 2% of GDP. The fact that this government has been willing to compromise with the opposition, and has responded to calls from its own members,  just goes to show that this government is a responsive government, a government more than willing to negotiate and compromise to deliver a budget that is fair to all parts of the country. This progressive stance to policy-making is further exemplified by the Education Secretary's views on the Education Reformation Motion., and I hope the rt. honourable member will join me in welcoming this new era of consensus based politics.  It would be unfortunate for the government to find itself outnumbered by the opposition. Were that the case, the government would no doubt draw legitimacy, and a democratic mandate, from the fact that its coalition agreement - the guiding light of the government - would still be supported by a majority of members."

MHOC,3e754i,HaveADream,5,Wed Jul 22 13:56:41 2015 UTC,"We will be releasing a statement later today which should clear up this rather unfortunate mess of rumours and hearsay which has been building over the past week.   However, I would remind the honourable member that the coalition agreement will always be the guiding document of the coalition and this present government."

As a member of Labour during the Progressive Labour days, and indeed the start of the party, I know what it's like to be in a party suffering from low levels of activity. In that sense, I can sympathise with the Communists.  However, I must express my continued disappointment that the Communists have not participated in many debates this term. It's not uncommon to see more members of the Vanguard, a party with just over half the seats of the Communists, engaging in debates more than the Communists. Why that is, I can't say."

MHOC,3e754i,purpleslug,3,Wed Jul 22 14:57:34 2015 UTC,"I believe they specifically requested that the vote in question last 48 hours; supposedly they've taken to streamlining their bureaucracy in response to their smaller membership.   My personal view is that there's a balance to be struck between simplicity and bureaucracy. In my time as Labour leader, I've always valued giving members a chance to take on a role within the party administration.

MHOC,3e3zk3,banter_lad_m8,5,Tue Jul 21 19:52:54 2015 UTC,"Opening Speech    Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.   What I am proposing in this motion is that we take a second look at the examination reforms put in place by The Rt Hon Michael Gove, all that time ago, and we take a big look at it and think, is this really what we want?  School has one primary purpose, and no, that's not to teach how to calculate momentum, or what Pythagoras' Theorem is, but it is to teach students how to learn, and teach students how to think, and when exams become focused on retaining information and simply writing it down, how is that helping anyone? Wouldn't it be better if we gave students questions that they could logically look at, and try to find solutions using their minds, not what they read in their science book the night before.  Reforming examinations will be a huge step in ensuring that the future generations have the mindset they need to think for themselves and to teach them how to be productive when learning how to work, or during their degrees.  I invite both the Education Secretary and the Shadow Secretary to share their thoughts on the motion.  Thank you."
MHOC,3e3zk3,HaveADream,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:00:12 2015 UTC,"I think this motion is well-intentioned but effectively pointless,  What we really need is to legislate on a subject by subject basis. For example I wrote the Foreign Language Education Reform Bill and I'd hope that the House will agree that that vastly improved the subject and solved many issues motions like this try to solve.  As well as this I think this motion is trying to go to the opposite extreme of how exams should work. The amount of knowledge someone is expected to know for GCSE is not substantial, and I wouldn't support reducing this amount.   This motion also presents many issues, but doesn't suggest as to how we could solve them. As I mentioned in this comment, any reform would mean we would have to invest much larger amounts of money to the exam boards themselves.    that's not to teach how to calculate momentum   This is a very important part of Physics, and at a GCSE level you get given the formula for it - all you have to do is rearrange it and use it. Does this not count as 'trying to find solutions using their minds' or....?   or what Pythagoras' Theorem is   A large part of Maths at GCSE level is being able to know some formula's and applying them. Problem solving is a subset or Critical thinking, so of course you will need some knowledge to be able to have this ever work in practice."
MHOC,3e3zk3,tyroncs,2,Tue Jul 21 23:19:06 2015 UTC,"I find myself in agreement with the Right Honourable Member. Legislating on a subject by subject basis would be an excellent way to specialise subjects and bring out the best in our young people. This motion could surely lead the way in bringing about such legislation, such as the recent Computer Science Education Bill."
MHOC,3e3zk3,MorganC1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:22:51 2015 UTC,"On a more meta point too, when we write a bill saying 'all subjects should do x and y' etc we are legally binding ourselves to write the reforms ourselves, as it is the Department of Education who has control over the National Curriculum.   Trying to leapfrog this process by pretending it is something simulated just means we would be missing out on lots of constructive debates on how to actually improve the whole Education System, and it'd be a shame if that happened"
MHOC,3e3zk3,tyroncs,4,Tue Jul 21 23:28:05 2015 UTC,"I like the idea; but while it calls for educational reform, we need detail on what that reform will be.   We may get exam boards to go for more applying of knowledge, but eventually the students learn exactly how to apply for each question. We need detailed proposals on the actual reforms, not just asking for them."
MHOC,3e3zk3,adam0317,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:01:17 2015 UTC,"I'll expand on that later in the bill, this motion is to gather debate and ideas of reform for said bill."
MHOC,3e3zk3,HaveADream,3,Tue Jul 21 20:03:13 2015 UTC,"But how do you apply the knowledge; eventually the students revise how to apply, and again its just their memory of how to apply- if you get what I am saying"
MHOC,3e3zk3,adam0317,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:03:58 2015 UTC,"The honourable gentlemen raises a good point, my initial thoughts on his concern that we don't just make examinations about information application, but expand on what we could do with exams, I mean, my hope is that we get to a point where they revise relevant information, without tearing themselves apart with stress, and then use that information they have revised to apply it on problem-solving questions, although he is right in that we need to make sure said students don't just revise application."
MHOC,3e3zk3,HaveADream,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:07:34 2015 UTC,"I'd also mention that from a practical standpoint it is very hard to try and make exams more open ended. Exam boards already find it incredibly difficult to mark everything before the deadline they are given, and that is with the questions all having set answers etc.  If you wanted to significantly reform them, you'd need to give a longer time period to exam boards and much more funding to them. For example they get any random people to mark science exams as you need no specialist knowledge of science to be able to as the questions are so simple, make them open ended and you'll actually need qualified people to mark it"
MHOC,3e3zk3,tyroncs,2,Tue Jul 21 22:57:32 2015 UTC,"The Exam Reform bill proposed by the government is far from what is needed to reform exams. To me, this motion makes far more sense."

MHOC,3e3zk3,InfernoPlato,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:12:41 2015 UTC,"The exam reform bill is just the start, it allows pupils to be under less pressure and prevents waking up on the wrong side of the bed ruining your life. Also if coursework can be moderated successfully it is the best way to show understanding, with extra timing and effort being can be applied, and is a lot easier to apply to real life situations than an exam limited to X marks per question."
MHOC,3e3zk3,akc8,3,Tue Jul 21 20:21:17 2015 UTC,"Coursework is an awful measure of intelligence. In Exams you need to be great at remembering information but for coursework you don't even need to do that because you're at home. It is in an uncontrolled environment which means students can get parents to help do their work or they can just copy and paste information at their will! Exams currently are not perfect but they are far better than coursework which in NO WAY helps anyone learn. Also can you use the excuse ""waking up on the wrong side of the bed"" when you are at work? Coursework is not a lot easier to apply to real life situations because coursework involves no learning! Students will just do exactly what they do in exams but they won't even have to remember information so I don't buy that argument either. If the Exam Reform Bill gets passed by the house I seriously worry for the future of our country."
MHOC,3e3zk3,cptp28,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:28:17 2015 UTC,"I have to fully disagree with you here! Firstly, coursework is a great way of measuring a range of things instead of just focussing on how much one student can cram into their head. That is not a proper measure of intelligence. Also, as I am still in education I can assure you that there really is a high level of control in controlled assessments and I would invite you to sit a controlled assessment and try and cheat as you describe it. Then you will find out how tough it actually is. Also, I don't believe that exams help children to remember the information either but at least coursework gets people to learn vital skills of how to structure and responses and other literary skills Therefore I fully support the bill and I greatly hope it does get past so you can be able to see why coursework really is the better option."
MHOC,3e3zk3,Politics42,2,Tue Jul 21 20:35:35 2015 UTC,"Firstly, coursework and controlled assessments are different things, coursework is in an uncontrolled environment and controlled assessments are not. I too am still in education. Whilst controlled assessments are OK you get so much time to prepare for them that there is no real skill  so involved because you get told what you are doing before you start. This means no application is involved at all and in some exams, particularly at A level, you do have to apply your knowledge. Coursework is a terrible measure of intelligence, controlled assessments are slightly better and exams are again slightly better but could be improved. Controlled assessments don't measure intelligence at all but exams have that potential if a successful exam reform is passed."
MHOC,3e3zk3,cptp28,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:42:52 2015 UTC,I understand what you are saying but I believe that coursework has already been scrapped.

To me, increasing coursework involved in GCSE's and A level's is not going to improve education. Controlled assessments are essentially exams but you are told specifically what is in it. So I struggle to see how that benefits a student more than exams do, even if exams could be improved."
MHOC,3e3zk3,cptp28,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:47:46 2015 UTC,"Nope, I did it in English, Geography, History and French (I finished my GCSE's a month or so ago.) I know others had to do it to in Spanish, Electronics, D.T, Drama, Music etc but I didn't take those subjects.  And I understand your point about coursework, but /u/theyeatthepoo's whole bill is looking at it from the wrong perspective. We should be legislating subject by subject to ensure we get the best for each subject (like with my Foreign Language Education Reform Bill. Saying 'every subject needs coursework' doesn't help anyone"
MHOC,3e3zk3,tyroncs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:04:43 2015 UTC,"I can assure you that there really is a high level of control in controlled assessments and I would invite you to sit a controlled assessment and try and cheat as you describe it.   It is incredibly easy,  Maybe your school was much nicer and 'cleaner' then mine but for my French controlled writing for example, a good third or so of the class wrote out their essays on tiny pieces of paper and copied them word for word.  In our Science ISA's we were basically told exactly how to do them down to each question. We had to do 'research' but were given a link with practically all the 'research' we needed on it. If you got odd results you could just fabricate them and all would be fine. If I am honest my teacher 'hinted' that we should when everyone was getting odd results which we knew we would lose marks for. Like how can it legitimate when almost my entire class got A*'s and full UMS for the final mark?"
MHOC,3e3zk3,tyroncs,2,Tue Jul 21 23:00:58 2015 UTC,"Coursework is useful, and important. It is a measure of independent learning and thinking, which is much more applicable in the real world.  I'm going to use a lot of what I said in the last reading now.     Coursework enables assessment based on work outside of simple knowledge retention that exams promote. Exams alone are a narrow method of assessment for both educators and employers, they do not provide a wide assessment of intelligence, and the skills themselves are narrow, dominantly being focused on knowledge retention, which isn't as useful in the modern world.  Coursework on the other hand is a different style of learning that allows a student to independently study and analyse work critically, a skill that is important for those seeking later employment and/or a University education. Analysis and judgement beyond retention of facts is an important skill, valued by employers.  Coursework on the other hand is a different style of learning that allows a student to independently study and analyse work critically, a skill that is important for those seeking later employment and/or a University education. Analysis and judgement beyond retention of facts is an important skill, valued by employers.  In addition the idea that coursework is open to abuse has merit on paper, until you take into account that exam boards check for plagiarism and that coursework is again, not evaluated by the content of basic information.   Whereas coursework could be a student compiling a list of information he/she only found several minutes ago. There is no learning there. It is testing nothing.   This is fundamentally incorrect. Coursework in many subjects (I'll use English for example) are marked using several guiding points. These include structure, form, content, analysis and more. These are outlined in my example through Assessment objectives 1 to 4, in my specific example here, of AQA English Lit B.. Coursework tests many things and learning most certainly happens. To dismiss the notion of it having any complexity or intricacy is insulting to those who do it.    So, to reiterate, the idea that coursework involves 'no learning' is false. As I can see in a comment further down, you mention English and that you remember nothing from it. First of all, that personal subjective experience doesn't necessarily apply to everyone, secondly the same accusation could be made against exams, which require the learning of information for a single use.  Referring back to English as well, the subject vitally needs Coursework. It is a skills based learning really, and it is useful for those who seek to do English later, and for the real world in general. Without it, English as a subject is diminished."
MHOC,3e3zk3,RadioNone,2,Tue Jul 21 21:54:07 2015 UTC,"OK so how do exam boards check that the student hasn't been helped by their parents? It does not in any way allow a student to work critically at all because all the student is doing is following a brief. There  is no critical thinking involved whatsoever. I struggle to see how being able to do the coursework at home where there are an infinite amount of sources available for a student to copy (not word for work, students are capable of rewording what they see and putting it down so it won't get flagged for plagiarism) means a student would learn better as they are not learning! Coursework is essentially like an exam except you have all the information in front of you! Where is the skill in that. Anyone can research the internet, find information and put it into an essay. It is an easy option and it won't improve our students' education."
MHOC,3e3zk3,cptp28,2,Tue Jul 21 22:08:06 2015 UTC,"That is a gross misrepresentation of what coursework is.  Exam boards don't just check for plagiarism as being word for word copying. It is obvious when a piece has been lifted.   Coursework is not just a list of sources chucked together. Students are marked on a range of qualifiers, part of which is essay writing and analysis, which happens after the information is handled and organised from the source. They are learning, skills useful for real life and further education.   Anyone can research the internet, find information and put it into an essay.    What? That's what essay writing is at its simple core. Research and analysis. The critical thinking comes from the organisation, application, use, analysis and etc of information. Again, skills based. Exam-only education is heavily focused on knowledge retention alone."
MHOC,3e3zk3,RadioNone,2,Tue Jul 21 22:15:38 2015 UTC,"In exams students are marked on their ability to analyse and to evaluate, it's just they also have to recall information from their head rather than having it right next to them. If you have all the information right in front of you, you are going to remember than information because you have no need to remember it! Some exams not only test your ability to remember things but also to analyse and evaluate. If this could be extended to make students think more critically then exams would be even better. However coursework is by far the worst of all the options to examine pupils. Also this puts kids with parents that aren't so bright at a disadvantage because parents are obviously going to help their kids with coursework. If parents are able to help their kids directly in their exams that should be a CLEAR sign that it is not a good idea!"
MHOC,3e3zk3,cptp28,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:23:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that exams are knowledge-retention alone. But it is obvious that they are not fully representative of real-life scenario. In real life the information isn't withheld from you. And its easy enough to forget information learnt for an exam once it's done.    However coursework is by far the worst of all the options to examine pupils.   I'm not going to repeat myself about why this is false, I have outlined the methodology and skill-based importance of coursework.  Furthermore a large portion of your argument is based on the assumption that Parents will simply help their kids through it. I'm yet to see any evidence of this, and even if they were, its likely that the teacher in class would pick this up. Its obvious to a teacher if a coursework is not student-written, as they know their style and having taught them, can pick up on such discrepancies. In addition the parent help may actually hinder, not help. so the student would be hurting them chances in several ways."
MHOC,3e3zk3,RadioNone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:33:55 2015 UTC,"Are you seriously suggesting you learn information better by not having to learn it at all? That's what coursework is, you don't have to learn any of the information and hence it isn't very challenging at all. I know that in real life the information isn't withheld from you but you learn better if it is withheld from you because then you have to learn it rather than just read it and put it into an essay. In accountancy, there is a reason they make you do an exam and not coursework, because you learn better from exams. Teachers are not likely to pick up on any help the student has received from their parents because how could they prove it? Also how would you implement coursework into the Maths course as well? You are yet to tell me what skills coursework can provide you with that exams can't."
MHOC,3e3zk3,cptp28,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:04:34 2015 UTC,Maybe we could reserve coursework to higher education e.g. A-Levels which unless your parents are specialised in the subject makes it harder to help. Plagiarism checks also make it difficult for students to purely copy and paste. Coursework is more applicable to most work as work is normally a continuous process of critical thinking up until a deadline. Exams are mostly about condensing as much information into your head for 1 time. In the day and age of the internet this is no longer such an important skill.
MHOC,3e3zk3,Arrikas01,2,Tue Jul 21 22:43:36 2015 UTC,But then you are just dumbing down higher level qualifications.
MHOC,3e3zk3,cptp28,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:05:44 2015 UTC,"How is it ""dumbing down"" if parents can't help properly and plagiarism is near impossible. Most people find retaining information in their head for a limited time easier than being able to fluently express their conclusions from their research in a logical manner. Exam questions aren't enough to fully explore an argument in sufficient depth. Many of my last exams were about putting together an argument backed up with a few facts and figures, countering it and then drawing a conclusion, all in 25 mins. Whilst Exams can address a broad range of topics and are unparalleled in their ability to assess memory and knowledge retention. I feel adding coursework to qualifications would help test other important skills especially as knowledge retention becomes less and less important for the majority of jobs."
MHOC,3e3zk3,Arrikas01,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:45:32 2015 UTC,But in exams there is NO way of getting parents to help or to commit plagiarism. Why take the risk if it's possible in coursework? No-one has yet told me what skills coursework can give a child that reformed exams cannot.
MHOC,3e3zk3,cptp28,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:04:38 2015 UTC,Of course you can commit plagiarism in exams. Exams use similar questions each year and you can learn past answers by rote and if they come up simply copy them down. How is that any different from copy and pasting from a webpage in a coursework. It may be easier to plagiarise coursework but plagiarism checkers are  normally accurate.
MHOC,3e3zk3,Arrikas01,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:14:04 2015 UTC,Similar but not the same so you can't copy old answers and even if you could you would still have to remember them. You can't commit plagiarism in exams but whilst doing coursework you can.
MHOC,3e3zk3,cptp28,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:51:36 2015 UTC,"In my last history paper, I had just done a past exam paper that had the same question merely reworded. So I was able to remember the marking criteria for the last paper and essentially copy down an answer. That requires a little more effort but does not in anyway test intelligence, which is all an exam is meant to do."

I would, however, like to ask how this motion would affect STEM subjects? As these subjects are solely based on fact and not interpretation, and so a more subjective mark scheme (As this motion seems to be demanding) would be inappropriate for such an exam."
MHOC,3e3zk3,Figgor,2,Tue Jul 21 20:00:03 2015 UTC,"You are right with these, for STEM subjects, I propose that we have a mix of both of these, for example, we give the student a problem, and they have to work out a solution to it using both tactics.

MHOC,3e3zk3,HaveADream,2,Tue Jul 21 20:02:38 2015 UTC,I'm in complete agreement with this motion. I will investigate and see if it is possible to include reform of this kind in the third reading of my Exam Reform Bill.

Recalling knowledge has its place, and information that will be needed in an individual's work is vital, however, logical and creative thinking are both vital in ensuring that students are qualified.  Might I suggest to the members submitting the eventual bill that is submitted that 2 types of exam be used - one recalling knowledge, and another with access to books ect. which focuses on actually thinking. What with the rise of the internet, individuals will often just be able to google anything they don't know, and while access to the unrestricted internet may not be appropriate, the relevant knowledge being on hand could stimulate such an environment. I urge the national member to take these ideas on board."

Secondly, I would like to point out Mr Deputy Speaker that Pythagoras' Therom is a technique for solving problems, not a fact to memorize like which year the Battle of Hastings took place in. Further calculating momentum is a fundamental building block of physics that is absolutely essential for student to learn and practice  in order for them to develop into the engineers and physicists of our future. It's Mass x Velocity, by the way.   This is, ultimately, not about exam reform Mr Deputy Speaker but instead about politics.

Further calculating momentum is a fundamental building block of physics that is absolutely essential for student to learn and practice in order for them to develop into the engineers and physicists of our future   In GCSE at least we get told all the formulas beforehand and only need to memorise what unit they use.

Which I view as a vital skill to enable higher learning but also is am exercise in problem solving because the student must apply his or her knowledge to solve the question in an exam.

We need a way that hard work and understanding can be rewarded. Instead of rewarding marks for remembering pointless facts , but instead for complete and total understanding of the subject. I think A Levels do this a lot better than GCSEs. The fact that 24% can be a pass however in GCSE Maths worries me that if we increase difficulty, fewer and fewer students will find in capable and the pass mark may fall further. In my opinion we need to change the content to what is relevant to modern life, addition of computer science and financial understanding, such as pensions and taxes. We need to grow citizens that understand life not just the textbooks even if they are not retaining knowledge but actually understand."

MHOC,3e4f9v,JamMan35,5,Wed Jul 22 07:20:25 2015 UTC,"I've already put my concerns about health allocations to the Honourable Minister for Health. They are political policies that don't address what the NHS asked for, and don't deal with core funding issues at the heart of the NHS.   Corporate Tax  The figures put out by the government on corporate tax revenues are wrong, and economically inaccurate. If reinvestment is taken out of tax altogether, the incentive to reinvest will be higher. This means firms will reinvest more, meaning the rate will no longer stand at 50%. This means lower overall rates and therefore less revenue.   If the large companies reinvested just 5% more into their operations, that would mean an overall 20.25% tax rate, resulting in a probable fall in revenue. In addition, these changes would mean fewer returns for investors, and therefore less capital for firms to work with down the road. And if the £115bn figure is accurate, it would strangle business in the UK, and result in a massive loss of investment.   Budget Deficit  I am pleased the government has come around on this issue, but the fact is the deficit is still too small. A 4.8% adjustment as a percentage of GDP has become a 3.0% adjustment. This relatively minor moderation is welcome, but still dwarfs the largest made by Osbourne, which was 1.7% of GDP and arguably had a negative effect on growth. As I've pointed out, the economic benefits of redistribution are limited and largely marginal, to the extent that they exist at all.   I can't support a budget that has a fiscal adjustment of more than 2.0% of GDP. Just because this government wants to outflank the opposition on this issue, doesn't mean I'll let them strangle our economy and destroy British business along with countless individual livelihoods. We need growth and a true recovery, and that means a balanced approach.   Rebalancing the Economy  With the large expansion of the state, the government has failed to participate in the structural rebalancing of the economy which is necessary. The government has taken massive amounts of money out of the private sector and put it in the public sector, and has spent it almost entirely on services. This means that we will be taking large amounts of money from extraction and manufacturing which are typically private sector, and investing it in services.   This has two negative effects. Firstly, it will increase our trade deficit by reducing our exports that come from manufacturing and extraction, by giving money to services that don't increase exports. Secondly, it will benefit certain regions of the country over others. Services are highly concentrated in urban areas and the south, while northern rural areas rely on manufacturing and extraction. Providing more services and taking from private companies through corporation tax and VAT will sabotage the process of creating a truly national economy by benefiting the south and urban areas disproportionately."
MHOC,3e4f9v,Zoto888,3,Tue Jul 21 22:43:11 2015 UTC,"This means lower overall rates and therefore less revenue   Correct, but there is substantial breathing room for more than a doubling of the deficit - it would also mean greater long-term tax receipts.   In addition, these changes would mean fewer returns for investors, and therefore less capital for firms to work with down the road   75% of businesses in the UK have only one shareholder and employee.  99% have fewer than 50 employees, and are less likely to have outside investment"".  In the long run, the change will increase our resistance to harsh global economic conditions and increase growth sustainability.   . A 4.8% adjustment as a percentage of GDP has become a 3.0% adjustment   The deficit in MHoC was previously £22 billion before this budget, so the decrease is hardly that sizeable.   This means that we will be taking large amounts of money from extraction    This reminds me of something that I need to add to the next budget.  At any rate, manufacturing, extraction, and similar industries have higher capital investment costs, and so will be strongly benefited by our changes to corporation tax - more so than the service sector, certainly.  Furthermore, I foresee the agricultural and tourist economies (both prime strengths of the rural economy) strengthening due to the increased purchasing power of the vast majority of the population, in particular those who have, until this point, not been able to afford luxuries such as a weekend break in Cornwall and Devon.  To compound on this, over half of the regional growth fund is dedicated specifically to industry and renewable energy, which, again, are primarily located outside of London and the South East.  On top of this, there is substantial regional infrastructure investment, particularly in the Midlands and Wales.  Finally, investment of over £1200 million in the UKSA shall benefit the engineering and manufacturing sector with compounding investment."

MHOC,3e4f9v,irule04,6,Tue Jul 21 22:51:55 2015 UTC,"Since when is it the duty of the government to promote marriage and family?

Indeed, one should not get married for those reasons, but the state should make it clear its views on marriage. I don't doubt that this budget does that. Our Government has no concern or regard for the traditional basis of our society."
MHOC,3e4f9v,irule04,6,Tue Jul 21 23:31:30 2015 UTC,"I think the government is quite clear on the fact that it supports marriage and shouldn't need to spend a billion pounds to make such a statement. If you want to assist families in becoming more stable, the money is better invested in things like education or even tax credits focused instead on families with children, seeing as how they're the financial burden. Married couples already more often share a residence and can share costs that make life more stable married, and as such, it has an already built in benefit that doesn't need to be provided by the government.  I think this budget is quite clear on its view of marriage, and that is that it's a personal decision and as a government we'd rather focus on improving other items with the money."
MHOC,3e4f9v,AlbrechtVonRoon,4,Tue Jul 21 23:39:35 2015 UTC,"It is indeed quite clear, and it is not in favour of marriage, but general cohabitation. You may not care, but I am concerned for the stability of society when its old forms are placed on the rubbish heap. It is pure liberal nonsense."

MHOC,3e4f9v,irule04,6,Tue Jul 21 23:51:44 2015 UTC,"I think the purpose of marriage is simply to express that you love someone, not that you need or want children automatically. The money could fund additional education programs instead of child tax credits then if you're seriously worried about that (though I'm not particularly, as having children for a tax credit certainly doesn't pay enough for it to be at all worth it) then the money could fund additional education or other things that help families, or even a tax credit to married families specifically with children, again eliminating the need to give a tax credit to every couple who's decided to get married."

The aid to them serves a multitude of purposes. First it aids these countries economies and dealing with the immense poverty found in Eastern Europe. In Macedonia for example 30.4% of the population lives below the poverty line, which is on par with many parts of the developing world. Second it serves a diplomatic and strategic role. Nations which we aid will be more friendly with us and as they grow their economies we will have a stronger ally.

The health policy outlined in this document is frankly abhorrent, proposing that we privatise the NHS in its entirety to be replaced by an insurance based system, a system which at best would only allow low income households to access a limited quality of care and at worst little to no care at all.   I'll concede that without the list of signatories the author claims to have, the legitimacy of this document is certainly questionable, however, if this is a reflection of how even a small proportion of the Opposition think about healthcare, then I still find the Opposition to be more of a concern right now than the Libertarian Party."

No, we don't. You shouldn't either, it exposes petty party politics and reflects badly. Health policy comes from /u/olmyster911.

MHOC,3dyd6n,DrNyan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:28:43 2015 UTC,"No, of course not. What I'm arguing is that the Libertarian Party have no legislative power whereas those Opposition members who were involved with this document, however few of them there might be, do, so relatively they are a larger threat.

MHOC,3dyd6n,DrNyan,5,Mon Jul 20 15:22:41 2015 UTC,"This is of course a huge issue, and one that I certainly do not take lightly.   The first problem to tackle is treatment. I hope that if we see the passing of the Mental Health Bill and the Psychotherapy Bill we will be able to take great strides in the quality of care we can give to young people suffering from mental health issues for these bills would oversee  the construction of new CAMHS units as well as providing a base level of psychotherapeutic care respectively. Beyond this, I detailed in the budget a significant capital investment, most of which I intend to be spent on improving mental health services.  Secondly, we have to address the stigma young people with mental health issues can potentially face among their peers. I see the key to addressing this lying in PSHCE education, which is again detailed in the Mental Health Bill. However, if this were not to pass, I would personally work with my colleague the education secretary to see mental health issues addressed in PSHCE education."

MHOC,3dyd6n,DrNyan,3,Mon Jul 20 16:39:18 2015 UTC,"I would tend to agree with that statement, as the only other logical conclusion really is that it's environmental factors while in the womb that are causing a rise in mental health issues among children, and with the majority mothers taking a great amount of care in pregnancy, I doubt this is the case.  However, I'd say that although our culture is becoming more accepting of mental health issues, I still believe that it is vital that we continue to tackle existing stigma through education, especially when referring to school children."

However, ever since the passing of the Drugs Reform Act earlier this year, the strain recreational drugs have on the taxpayer have been minimised, with the taxation of recreational drugs and the relief legalisation has had on police expenditure saving the taxpayer approximately £966 million every year. It's also important to note that a considerable portion of these savings are re-invested into NHS services such as drug rehabilitation centres, so we are also limiting the strain drugs have on NHS services too."
MHOC,3dyd6n,TheInfernalRain,5,Tue Jul 21 22:45:47 2015 UTC,"Whatever your stance is on recreational drug legalization, can we please stop looking at this from a financial perspective, and instead look at the ethics of the situation?"

MHOC,3dyd6n,mcr3527,3,Mon Jul 20 16:47:05 2015 UTC,"Mr Deputy Speaker, taking /u/InfernalRain's point into consideration, does the Health Secretary feel it is ethical for the government to, directly or indirectly, cause a rise in deaths and injuries related to drug use?  There have been many tragic incidents noted to be directly related to the Drugs Reform Act.  Will the Health Secretary commit a percentage of NHS spending to helping reduce the abuse of recreational drugs, therefore relieving the NHS of this easily avoidable expenditure, as well as reducing deaths and injuries which can be related, directly or indirectly, to drug use?"
MHOC,3dyd6n,DrNyan,3,Mon Jul 20 17:00:30 2015 UTC,"The fact of the matter is that those who wish to buy and use recreational substances will do so regardless of it is legal or not, thus I believe the most ethical thing the government can do is legalise recreational drug use, for the following reasons.  First of all, we're eliminating an incredibly dangerous criminal market, removing a large proportion of drug related injuries and death caused by an ineffective war on this criminal market.  Secondly, removing the legal taboo surrounding recreational drugs opens up a real conversation about the issues surrounding these drugs, allowing for preventative measures before any damage is done.  Thirdly, I have to go back to the financials, for they allow us to fund real rehabilitation and education measures, again reducing the amount of damage drugs cause to our society.  No matter what, recreational drugs will cause injuries and death, however, legalisation gives us the tools we need to effectively reduce the amount of these injuries and deaths.  As for spending to reduce the use of recreational drugs, this was something that was addressed in the Drugs Reform Act, which pledged NHS spending to the production of informative materials as well as recurring national campaigns aimed at reducing recreational drug usage."

However, beyond this we need to invest in further CAMHS and mental health clinics, for these are really the key to combating the negative effects mental health issues have, and I hope that the substantial capital investment I detailed in the budget will achieve this.

Although high amounts of sugar in foods is certainly a big issue, and one that undoubtedly lead to a rise in childhood obesity, I would personally be uncomfortable with a tax as it would add to the financial hardship faced by Britain's poorer households.  However, the issue still obviously needs to be addressed. Two ways of going about this could be to legislate for lower added sugars in foods as well as promoting healthier foods and providing financial incentive to manufacturers who produce said foods.   I also stated in an earlier question about tackling childhood obesity that I would like to see education for parents and children on how to cook simple healthy dishes, and I think that advice also rings true here for reducing the amount of sugars in our diets."

MHOC,3dyd6n,GhoulishBulld0g,2,Mon Jul 20 18:23:11 2015 UTC,"Mr Deputy Speaker,  What is the Secretary of State for Health plans to make consultants and specialists work during the weekend?"
MHOC,3dyd6n,DrNyan,2,Mon Jul 20 18:20:47 2015 UTC,"It is of course vital that we are able to provide a high quality of specialist care throughout the week for patients in the NHS.  However, we must consider that these consultants and specialists aren't machines, so we must take great care in any contract negotiation that they are properly rewarded for any new hours as well as ensuring that existing services aren't jeopardised by a lack of resources caused by over-stretching current staff to fit in new hours."
MHOC,3dyd6n,GhoulishBulld0g,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:21:48 2015 UTC,"Also Mr Deputy Speaker,  Is the Secretary of State going to cut Consultants and Doctors wages to raise the wages of Nurses?"
MHOC,3dyd6n,DrNyan,2,Mon Jul 20 15:24:02 2015 UTC,"No, with the current health budget we can afford this pay raise without cutting the wages of any other members of NHS staff."
MHOC,3dyd6n,mcr3527,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:43:30 2015 UTC,Bureaucrats with clipboards or doctors with stethoscopes?
MHOC,3dyd6n,DrNyan,2,Mon Jul 20 22:55:37 2015 UTC,"Both!  The NHS is a huge organisation, so we need bureaucrats for planning and administration as much as we need doctors and nurses to deliver NHS services.  The crucial thing is that we achieve whatever balance is necessary between these two sides of the NHS to ensure we can provide the best quality of care possible to patients."
MHOC,3dyd6n,mcr3527,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:02:37 2015 UTC,I assume you are not a supporter of patient centred health care then?
MHOC,3dyd6n,DrNyan,2,Mon Jul 20 17:51:44 2015 UTC,"I would say that you have assumed wrongly. Listening to the views of patients is key to creating an NHS that is responsive to their needs, however, I would not expect patients to plan and execute policy changes themselves. It's the job of the bureaucrats to take on board the views of patients while they conduct the planning and administration of the NHS as an organisation."
MHOC,3dyd6n,Mepzie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:04:17 2015 UTC,"With more and more strain on A&E in the UK, how will the SoS for Health get more people going to their GP's for minor problems rather than them clogging up A&E?"
MHOC,3dyd6n,DrNyan,3,Mon Jul 20 20:32:09 2015 UTC,"Firstly, and quite obviously, we need to ensure that the GPs are available in the first place, and I believe my recent pledge in the budget to hire 550 new GPs will help ensure that this is the case.  Secondly, we need to raise awareness that this is a major issue, and I believe that posters such as this are quite effective at achieving this. As such, while considering what will be done with the surplus left over for future projects in the budget, funding these campaigns will certainly be on the list."
MHOC,3dyd6n,Mepzie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:39:17 2015 UTC,"Hear, hear. I did think that was one of the highlights of the budget in my opinion.  And yes I agree. I would certainly like to see more funds allocated towards these campaigns as the overcrowding of A&E's is a huge problem."

MHOC,3dyd6n,DrNyan,2,Mon Jul 20 20:21:12 2015 UTC,"I quite like the system adopted by a considerable amount of European countries of having no minimum consumption age, but maintaining a minimum age of 18 to buy alcohol.  This is because it removes the legal taboo surrounding young people drinking, allowing for a real discussion of the responsibilities of the individual both to look after themselves and their peers while drinking, but it still means that only an adult could legally obtain alcohol for their child, meaning parents still have a considerable say in whether their children drink or not."

MHOC,3dyd6n,JamMan35,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:13:56 2015 UTC,"In the budget, the Honourable Minister has been allocated an extra £10bn. He chose to spend this on a pay increase for nurses, social care, and investment in mental health. While these are undoubtedly important issues, they aren't integral to the key funding that the NHS needs at the core. Why didn't the health secretary take suggestions from the NHS itself, like stabilising core funding for general practice, providing new funding to the Challenger Fund, or fully interoperable electronic health records so that patients’ records are largely paperless?"
MHOC,3dyd6n,DrNyan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:27:47 2015 UTC,"In terms of stabilising funding for general practices, I believe that the complete settlement of the NHS internal deficit laid out in the budget paves the road towards stable funding for all sections of the NHS. It's also worth noting that the hiring of 550 new GPs which was also laid out in the budget will do a great deal in ensuring that all general practices in the UK can provide consistent high quality care.  As for further investment in the Challenge Fund and improvements in patient record digitisation, these are both projects that I'll certainly look into when allocating the remaining surplus left over from the original budget, especially the digitisation of records for it is crucial that we keep these systems up to date with modern advancements in technology."
MHOC,3dv94o,NoPyroNoParty,24,Sun Jul 19 20:23:40 2015 UTC,"As per usual, the ideologically obsessed Transport Secretary, who has a fetish about trains, only cares about Trains. I suggest that the government just gets on with it, and rename it the Department of Trains. Because this government fundamentally fails when it comes to other forms of transport.   Of course Mr Speaker, we must ensure that we work to improve the environment, but intentionally damaging our economy and position within the world, for ideological reasons is utterly disgusting. This incompetent and ideologically driven Trains Secretary is a disgrace to this house, especially when he so claims to care about the countries transport.   Let us make no delusions, this decision will cost jobs, growth and will put our position in the world as a leader in air travel at risk. Is is a dreadful decision that the government, and the Minister, should be ashamed of."
MHOC,3dv94o,demon4372,16,Sun Jul 19 20:31:15 2015 UTC,"Wow I ask myself, where to begin? Let's start with some myth busting I think it's important for the house to communicate truths and not hyperbolic myths. Yes, I am interested in trains and seek to further improve the rail network however I wouldn't call this fetishisation, if you want to say I fetishise something surely the environment would be something? However you claim that I only care about trains which would imply that in my duty as Transport Secretary I have only, cared about trains. It is what your statement implies. So surely it must strike you as odd to have passed through this house the Local Transport Act 2014 which regulated the bus network and local authority transport? If I am only interested in trains would you expect me to have invested in a green bus fund? To have invested in the study of hydrogen buses? Surely as a man who fetishises trains I would have divested the money I allocated for this and sent it off to the railways instead?   Anyway onto the matter of subject, the airport expansion and the view that this government has taken. Or more what your posting goes onto. It seems somewhat hypocritical to say that we must 'work to improve our environment' and yet you support the expansion of our South Eastern airport capacity. We can take this opportunity now to attract investment into sectors of the economy which won't wreck our environment and will provide actual long term jobs which don't rely upon us increasing the rate at which we damage the environment.   You call me incompetent and yet you cite no real reason other than the fact the government has made the decision not to go ahead with airport expansion. Now you say this will cost jobs and I have cited reasons why this really won't so let's storm on. Ah you say I am a 'disgrace to this house' because I want to protect the environment? I would reserve the grand title as 'disgrace to this house' as someone who does something which will cause suffering to people and the planet, not someone who has taken a decision to try and curb the increasing attack on the planet that the air industry has done as well as ensure that the local residents don't have to face the misery of either losing their house to the new runway or deal with an even worse quality of air. This may not sound like much after all what harm can it do. Well the right honourable member / earl may find it easier to comprehend the damage this will do in terms of humans, and with the recent reports that 9400 people die because of London's air pollution why should the government give the go ahead to something that will increase air pollution and therefore increase the number of lives we lose to the air. I thought Pasteur but to bed the idea that 'bad air' or miasma caused deaths however if we went ahead with this airport expansion we can be sure that prescribing miasma as a cause will not be so 1810s and more 2010s.   As I say in the statement, why should we want to be a world leader in something that is the one of the largest producers of carbon emissions in developed countries. Your argument is inherently flawed because you fail to look at the wider consequences. I take no shame in trying to stop the destruction of our environment, it's just a shame that you and many others don't.     To add I thought I would check out your manifesto that you were elected on (before you took up your peerage) and I did find that you state that you will 'continue to oppose the plans to expand Heathrow' (however I know you'll wriggle out of that). You also say that '[you] will expand and modernise the rail network, with particular attention given to high speed rail, to ensure that we have some of the best rail infrastructure in the world.' and 'will roll out the High Speed Rail 2 project, and look into any future projects to further expand our rail infrastructure' - does this mean you fetishise trains too?   And finally, to add to the hypocrisy, you say in your manifesto 'we must protect the environment and work to stop the affects of Climate Chance so to protect our society and planet in the long term, without a healthy environment society cannot function' which is surely totally at odds with the argument you put forward in relation to why we should build this runway."

MHOC,3dv94o,vogon101,2,Sun Jul 19 22:45:09 2015 UTC,"good for the environment, it is bad for Britain.   These two surely contradict each other, if it is good for the environment it is good for Britain's future."

MHOC,3dv94o,peter199,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:25:59 2015 UTC,"Right, so firstly, sorry for only just replying, i was busy with other things.   However you claim that I only care about trains which would imply that in my duty as Transport Secretary I have only, cared about trains. It is what your statement implies. So surely it must strike you as odd to have passed through this house the Local Transport Act 2014 which regulated the bus network and local authority transport?

Surely as a man who fetishises trains I would have divested the money I allocated for this and sent it off to the railways instead?   The fact you have also happened to invest in Bus' alongside Trains in one of your acts is entirely irreverent to the point at hand. My point was, you for national transport means, care only about Trains, while making comments dismissing any other form of transport such as cars and planes. Cars, which can be made environmentally friendly, and Planes which are essential to connect us to the rest of the world.    It seems somewhat hypocritical to say that we must 'work to improve our environment' and yet you support the expansion of our South Eastern airport capacity.   Because i believe that we cannot cripple ourselves, our standing in the world, and our ability to connect with the world, in order to make the job easier. Dealing with Climate Change isn't easy, but crippling ourselves, and only focusing on this, is completely ludicrous. We need a balance between dealing with climate change, and growing the economy.   We can take this opportunity now to attract investment into sectors of the economy which won't wreck our environment and will provide actual long term jobs which don't rely upon us increasing the rate at which we damage the environment.   This is a moot point, as we can invest of other sectors of the economy, while undergo this essential airport expansion.   You call me incompetent and yet you cite no real reason other than the fact the government has made the decision not to go ahead with airport expansion. Now you say this will cost jobs and I have cited reasons why this really won't so let's storm on.   Ah you say I am a 'disgrace to this house' because I want to protect the environment?    This is a fantastical twisting of my words, and a view entirely detached from reality. I said that is was a disgrace that you are crippling this country for your own ideological fervour, and lazyness, since you want to take the easy and damaging rout to dealing with climate change, rather than the harder, but more beneficial way.   I would reserve the grand title as 'disgrace to this house' as someone who does something which will cause suffering to people and the planet, not someone who has taken a decision to try and curb the increasing attack on the planet that the air industry has done as well as ensure that the local residents don't have to face the misery of either losing their house to the new runway or deal with an even worse quality of air.    There are many ways to combat this, while not crippling ourselves. As far as i am aware, we will still meet the EU air pollution targets even with this airport. And we cannot have a NIMBY view, and hold back economic progress because of a handful of disgruntled residents.    This may not sound like much after all what harm can it do. Well the right honourable member / earl may find it easier to comprehend the damage this will do in terms of humans, and with the recent reports that 9400 people die because of London's air pollution[1] why should the government give the go ahead to something that will increase air pollution and therefore increase the number of lives we lose to the air. I thought Pasteur but to bed the idea that 'bad air' or miasma caused deaths however if we went ahead with this airport expansion we can be sure that prescribing miasma as a cause will not be so 1810s and more 2010s.   As i already said, as far as i am aware, we will still meet our EU targets despite the new runway. And there are other things we can do, such as moving onto electric/hydrogen cars and bus' within cities, to combat air pollution. It is not that i do not want to combat this, its that i think it is foolish to try and cripple our air transport to meet some targets, when there are better ways to meet the same objective.    As I say in the statement, why should we want to be a world leader in something that is the one of the largest producers of carbon emissions in developed countries. Your argument is inherently flawed because you fail to look at the wider consequences. I take no shame in trying to stop the destruction of our environment, it's just a shame that you and many others don't.   I look at the winder consequences, absolutely. And being a world leader in air travel is essential to our economy, for trade and travel. And crippling ourselves, which is what you are doing, is absolutely disgraceful. Especially when there are, abet harder, altervatives to deal with the issues you have highlighted.    To add I thought I would check out your manifesto that you were elected on (before you took up your peerage) and I did find that you state that you will 'continue to oppose the plans to expand Heathrow' (however I know you'll wriggle out of that).   With the greatest respects to Remiel, he has a personal interest in Heathrow, and is the person who pushed for that in the manifesto, since none of us really had a opinion at the time. However, with this report i have personally formed by opinion that the benefits of heathrow  far outweigh the costs, as long as we do other things to tackle climate change.   You also say that '[you] will expand and modernise the rail network, with particular attention given to high speed rail, to ensure that we have some of the best rail infrastructure in the world.' and 'will roll out the High Speed Rail 2 project, and look into any future projects to further expand our rail infrastructure'    Things that i am glad you have done, and i commend you for doing for the most part.

Absolutely not, as i have highlighted. We can deal with climate change, while still ensuring that we can stay a world leader in air travel, and keep ourselves connected to the world. We cannot cower in the dark, we need to deal with climate change head on, while growing and expanding our economy and place on the world stage."

Building another runway isn't going to be adding a great deal to carbon emissions, becoming a hub airport just means we want flights to go via the UK to bring us money, rather than letting other countries in our vicinity to take that opportunity.

The government is taking an important stance on this contencious matter however, it is also significant that we are putting the environment first sending out a clear message to the international community that we must not allow our environment be damaged by things rammed forwards on economic arguments only.   I understand that it will allow us to strengthen our hub airport however it is recognised that if this goes ahead Heathrow will become the biggest emitter of CO2 in the country, I don't think this is something we can just brush over. This isn't something which can be out-argued by claims of enhanced economic growth. If we continue to go ahead with this we will end up seeing major changes to the planets environment, we will see more flooding in Southern England, more changes in eco-systems (for example we have seen species of butterfly usually only seen in the south of England in Edinburgh as the planet warms) and more of the poorest places in the world suffer from the effects of climate change. It would be purely hypocritical for anyone to claim to care about climate change and the environment and also support the expansion of our airports, it would be skin deep environmentalism something which unfortunately plagues this house, particularly in the parties opposite."
MHOC,3dv94o,DrNyan,2,Mon Jul 20 18:25:42 2015 UTC,"But you are not being coherent on this issue. On a worldwide scale this will just mean the CO2 will be emitted in the Netherlands or France rather than the UK - with the money that would've been earned from it staying in those countries. If you were told 'this CO2 is going to be emitted anyway, but if you do it we will give you lots of money' would you outright say No?  China and America have made an agreement stating that they are only going to bother to start trying to reduce their CO2 emissions in 2030. Anything we do in comparison is meaningless compared to them.   And you mention flooding in Southern England, on a worldwide scale our emissions are statistically insignificant, and most of that is the fault of the Environment Agency being incompetent.    It's a shame that the Shadow Secretary of State for Education doesn't share the view of my right honourable colleague the Secretary of State for Education on this matter!    Oddly us in UKIP and the Socialists don't have much common ground, like we don't even have a chat with them like we do with you guys ;)"
MHOC,3dv94o,peter199,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:47:42 2015 UTC,"I differ from the opinion of the right honourable gentleman that I feel the mentality of 'oh well China / America will only do stuff later' is detrimental to the war on climate change that we must engage in. You say it's meaningless and yet it will make a difference. If we are able to develop green technology ourselves and adapt our lifestyles we can act as a symbol to the world about how they can be. I do indeed and it's widely recognised that this flooding was caused by the changing in our climates to hotter summers and wetter winters as a result of global warming. Yes the EA did not respond appropriately to the floods due to budgetary cuts, however they wouldn't have had anything to respond to if the climate hadn't changed!  Shh don't let out the real special relationship <3"

MHOC,3dv94o,Figgor,5,Sun Jul 19 22:08:46 2015 UTC,"Whilst I appreciate the sentiment of this statement, I can't help but feel that airport expansion is essential. The fact of the matter is that if the population increases, as it is doing, then carbon emissions will inevitably go up, and simply ignoring the needs of a growing population will not solve the problem.  I also can't fathom how expanding railways will address the problems that are caused by airports being over capacity. One of the main problems with airports such as Heathrow being over capacity is that it can no longer compete with international connections, and improving our domestic railways does nothing to combat this."
MHOC,3dv94o,peter199,4,Sun Jul 19 21:48:24 2015 UTC,"The needs of a growing population are surely in the provision and delivery of public services and national infrastructure, not in the expansion of something that will increase our carbon in emissions and air pollution. I have cited a number of times tonight that almost 9500 Londoners die each year because of air pollution, I don't think this is something which we can afford to increase. And in relation to our domestic rail network, if we can increase the share of the market that rail has on all routes then domestic flights will reduce and some capacity will be freed however it is still important that we just don't go ahead and expand airports."
MHOC,3dv94o,Figgor,3,Sun Jul 19 22:03:44 2015 UTC,"I accept that maybe Heathrow may not be the best candidate for airport expansion due to certain implications, but what about airports in the North? Airports in the North are among the fastest growing in the country, the simple fact is that these airports need to be expanded. And also, simply put, Heathrow is the airport that garners most international interest, and it is in our business interest to expand it and access more international connections.  And addressing your point about domestic air travel being reduced, thus freeing up space for international travel. Domestic air-travel made up 7% of the passengers going through Heathrow in 2014. Let's say rail-travel removed 50% of this number going through Heathrow (a very optimistic number I might add) then that is still only an additional 3.5% capacity freed up for international air travel. How can you say that an additional 3.5% is enough to deal with Heathrow losing international business due to over capacity?"
MHOC,3dv94o,jazdisney,3,Sun Jul 19 22:20:20 2015 UTC,"Then you are merely shifting the environmental implications from one area to another. You're merely moving the problems up the country, I understand that the economic arguments in favour for this are tantalising and I can assure the member that speak of the economic benefits I recognise airport expansion does being made this decision hard however we must break the trend of doing everything in the interests of the market and not the environment."
MHOC,3dv94o,peter199,2,Sun Jul 19 23:32:00 2015 UTC,"The fact is that we cannot financially support more environmental policy without expanding the economy. And if you ignore the interests of the international market, then you cannot support environmental policy sustainably.  I understand that a trend needs to be broken, but don't do so without thinking of all the implications."
MHOC,3dv94o,jazdisney,2,Sun Jul 19 23:54:14 2015 UTC,"I have thought of the implications, we could have more revenue however you would also have the increase in air pollution, the effects this has on the 725,000 people already living under the flight path and also the fact that just 12% of heathrows traffic is business related however due to the overstatement of the business traffic it is always perceived to be higher.   Yes we needed the finance to tackle climate change, but we have that as shown in our budget. We are investing in fighting climate change and making the right decisions in order to ensure we don't authorise the largest emitter of CO2 in the country to be built. It would, in my opinion, be an unforgivable thing to authorise an expansion of our runways and it would not be us who feel the costs of this, it would be our children and the people in the poorest countries in the world who are effected."
MHOC,3dv94o,Crazyoc,2,Mon Jul 20 17:14:53 2015 UTC,"So are you saying that there is not a need for Heathrow expansion? The airport already runs at 98% capacity, and the flow of passengers is only growing. Simply ignoring the problem doesn't make it go away, that would be like saying that we won't build any more houses because houses cause an increase in CO2 emissions.  If you are concerned that building an extra airport would have environmental implications that would affect our children, you have already said that your government is planning to reduce carbon emissions significantly by investing in tackling climate change. And so, the net level of CO2 produced by Britain will be reduced according to the governments plans. This means that the increase in carbon emissions a third runway would cause are negligible in the broader scheme of things.  In addition to this, you mention the 725,000 people effected by air pollution, are you saying that the needs of 725,000 people trump the needs of the entire country in terms of an extra £30bn added to the economy?"
MHOC,3dv94o,remiel,4,Mon Jul 20 17:33:00 2015 UTC,"This is quite frankly outrageous, a commission set up in order to find the best available choice to create further capacity in the south east is now being told that not only is its recommendation not going to be chosen, but in fact the whole commission was pointless, the SoS was never in fact going to even think about further runways in the south east or maybe even anywhere in the UK. What a complete waste of the taxpayer’s money.  I also (unsurprisingly) see that the SoS fails to see into the long term economic benefits, which are absolutely vast, the money generated from such an expansion could be pumped into hugely beneficial programs in order to fuel research and development into more fuel efficient and greener technology for the future; instead he has chosen to take us back into the past and regress to an age where innovation suffocates. Not to mention the boost in tax revenues that the government will receive due to massively increased growth of the economy; it can all be used to counteract a short term issue in the form of the emissions. I understand the problem that the SoS is trying to combat and I too feel strongly about our environment, but I do seriously think his cost/benefit analysis has gone terribly wrong and needs rectifying.   I now turn to the rather strange idea of distorting the market. The clear reason that we need more runways in the south east is due to demand, and that’s not predicted demand in 20 years’ time, it’s demand right now. If we were to open another runway at Heathrow as suggested it would almost be at full capacity again seeing as how long the project is planned to take. The UK is in a prime location for transatlantic stopovers and connections, and London is one of the biggest hub airports in the world. The demand generated is increasing and by meeting that demand, huge benefit will be delivered as I have described above. I agree with the SoS that investment into our rail network is important but this must be done alongside airport expansion. There is far more demand in airport expansion than there is in rail expansion. I am actually a frequent user of the London to Edinburgh domestic flight route and an occasional user of the rail journey. I prefer to fly, as does the market, and so I believe that that is where we should be opening up, rather than pretending that we can force people to take the train when it could be far more expensive, take longer to upgrade to be more worthwhile and competitive with air travel, and above all not cost effective for the traveller or the government.  Investment is a hugely important part of what the government does and it is vital to maintaining a strong and prosperous economy. The south east needs more capacity and it needs it now, I do hope the SoS sees the error of his ways and gives the people of the UK and the world what they so desperately need."
MHOC,3dv94o,peter199,3,Mon Jul 20 10:01:58 2015 UTC,"Right where to begin, okay well I never set up the commission it was actually set up IRL by your party in 2012. I personally wouldn!'t have set up a commission since I am opposed to airport expansion but I'm not a Tory transport secretary so hey ho. Now, crucially you state the economic benefits as being somewhat more important. Now I believe I have said previously that this debate comes down to the perspective you choose to take on matters like this, do you steam roller it through on the back of a hyped up economic argument (it is often stated that Heathrow needs to expand for business flights and business travellers however they account for only 12% of Heathrows traffic which somewhat distorts the argument), or do you recognise that we have a chance here? Recognise that we can make a statement that this government, this country, believes that we can't go on in the cycle of broken promises on the environment. We can recognise that yes we are presented with a tantelising economic opportunity, but we are also presented with an even better opportunity. I think of it as if we are presented with an value range chocolate cake (the expansion of the airport) and the option to make our own cake, it might take time but we come out with a better product. This is what we have! We have the chance to go for the less sexy, less immediate option; creating a sustainable future.   We can look at this as an opportunity, one I wish to work with my right honourable friend the Earl of Essex, /u/nopyronoparty, and create a future of sustainable jobs not based on the use of fossil fuels and environment damage. I see that the honourable member makes a rather convincing argument for this based on investment in cleaner fuels and technology all paid for by growth and whatnot, which I will give to the honourable member is very convincing. However, if we are to ensure we don't see the destructive 2°C of warming, it's agreed we need to be zero-carbon. Now even if we invest in new technology and use bio-fuels we could probably only sustain around one third of current air traffic. The commission itself found that with a new runway at Heathrow will lead to massive increases in CO2 levels with an even bigger yellow blob hanging over west London shown on air quality maps. By the airports own standards Heathrow is already an environmental issue; Heathrow is quite simply one of the UK’s pollution hotspots. In 2012, it breached safety thresholds for nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter air content at several different locations - and times – according to the airport’s own measurements. The aviation industry is responsible for around five percent of annual global warming and this is predicted to grow, in fact by 2030 it's predicted that it will be double what it was in 2005. This is unacceptable.   The honourable gentleman seems not to have grasped what I am talking about. You talk about forcing as if we are going to pluck planes out of the sky and shove a locomotive and DVT round them and ram it down the East Coast - this is far from the truth of our plan. Why does the honourable gentleman fly? Is it because the rail market is expensive as his grace the Duke of Cumbria, /u/duncs11, illustrated (I shall come to answering his grace shortly!)? Or is it because the times aren't convenient? Regardless of this we need to make the rail service more attractive and East Coast actually proved that it can be done. Furthermore, you act as if the market isn't interested in rail on the East Coast, when the figures themselves show this isn't true and really highlight this as an area for growth on the rails. For example, rail holds an 88% share of the London to Newcastle east coast market and 41.6% of the London to Edinburgh market. This demonstrates to us that if we make services attractive and frequent we can increase the modal share that rail has through better timetabling and better fares, fare cuts and more trains per hour will encourage further modal shift. You seem to recognise that markets are dynamic and yet don't want rail to compete with its competitors!  You say the people of the world need this new runway, however I and many others would disagree. The people of the world need a sustainable and safe future. Not one plagued by flooding, tropical diseases, ecological changes and the total loss of people's homes due to rising sea levels. This year the world comes together to discuss climate change, we should be having a national conversation about how to reduce energy demand and tackle climate change collectively, we shouldn't be storing up our own carbon bomb."
MHOC,3dv94o,ZanderyS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:21:11 2015 UTC,"I thank the Secretary of State of the response. I do believe there are two major points that we will however not be able to agree on.   I appreciate the metaphor of the cake but don't feel it accurately represents the situation, you do go on further to recognise the full argument of short term loss for future gain in terms of the benefits of economic growth provided. I think we just come to slightly different conclusions, I believe we can drive forwards and with innovation and leaps in technology there will be a sustainable future in flying, there is no way we can achieve this without letting the market invest in the aviation industry and I really do think that stopping this investment is a mistake.  I have many reasons to fly the London/Edinburgh route, it is almost always cheaper and faster. It is a more pleasant journey without having to sit on one train for at least 5 hours, it is more varied and interesting; also I really like planes, having flown a few myself and just having always enjoyed them.   My point about the market was not about restricting train competition, I'm all for as much competition as possible, I would be happy to provide upgraded rail links as well as airport expansion. The point was that there is far more in terms of spare capacity in demand for airports, especially in the south east; that it's portion of the market is being restricted much further than the railways portion due to failure to invest.   I appreciate that at least the SoS does intend to invest in the future even if it's not quite as far as I would like to see and I hope he maintains his forward thinking attitude in the future."

MHOC,3dv94o,ZanderyS,2,Mon Jul 20 10:05:29 2015 UTC,"I find myself agreeing with Secretary of State. There is too much reliance on internal flights within in UK and expanding our rail network, preferably with high speed rail, is a better solution to our transport needs.  Linking the London airports and Birmingham with high speed rail, will allow the airports to act as a hub, to take advantage of the additional capacity, so that they may service the additional destinations needed to grow our economy.  As someone who has been campaigning against Heathrow expansion for several years, and understands the arguments around this area, this announcement is welcome."
MHOC,3dv94o,peter199,2,Mon Jul 20 06:05:08 2015 UTC,"I am very thankful of the support which the right honourable gentleman provides. The linkage you detail in relation to HSR and airports around London is true, hence why we are not going to stall progress on HS2."
MHOC,3dv94o,ZanderyS,2,Mon Jul 20 17:16:22 2015 UTC,So you want to stop quick flights and replace with slow train journeys? I personally feel that both planes and trains complement each other and that another runway should be built at Heathrow.  You guys are crazy.
MHOC,3dv94o,peter199,2,Mon Jul 20 07:29:30 2015 UTC,I am so glad the honourable member was able to set out such a detailed argument. You seem to totally ignore the environment in your arguments failing to recognise that this as a factor.

You're far too happy to go ahead with something which will become the largest emitter of CO2 in the country and increase air pollution in London to even more dangerous levels (despite the fact 9500 people die in London each year due to air pollution) to seem like you actually care about the environment. A shameful position to take.
MHOC,3dv94o,Duncs11,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:34:47 2015 UTC,"The environment around Heathrow is ruined anyway, what's the harm in adding one more runway to a ruined ecosystem?

MHOC,3dv94o,Crazyoc,2,Mon Jul 20 19:49:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about the environment around Heathrow you don't seem to understand the wider impact this will have on the environment through increased air pollution and carbon emissions. Your statement is so uninformed the honourable gentleman really ought to be more informed; it is suggested here and here that, even with biofuels, it will not be possible to acheive 'zero carbon' status if levels of air traffic remain static. Unfortunately the honourable member and his friends opposite do not seem to understand this."
MHOC,3dv94o,I_miss_Chris_Hughton,2,Tue Jul 21 00:30:29 2015 UTC,"This issue is one that has both merits and downfalls, and I can fully appreciate the opposition to it. Of course, part of the reason that Britain is on top relates to our exceptional air capacity.  However, what is also true is that there currently exists a serious north-south divide in this country. Being on top means nothing if the only beneficiaries are a small bourgeois bohemians in London. As a nationalist, I would like to see the nation brought closer together, and I believe that this reappropriation of resources from international travel to domestic travel is a step in the right direction.  Our Empire was built upon a great manufacturing hub in the UK. While we had a vast expanse of land across the world which was vital, we as British stood at the heart of it, and did not hold aloof as we do so now. And, that manufacturing heartland would be nothing without an expansive system of railways and canals. The latter is quite obviously of less importance. But, our railways continue to be vital for the expansion of both old and new trades, which of course includes commuting. I would ask then, that does the Minister agree with me that alongside this revival in rail transport, we ought to look into reviving our manufacturing heartlands? I know this may be out of the Ministers remit, but I think the issues go hand in hand."
MHOC,3dv94o,peter199,3,Mon Jul 20 15:11:28 2015 UTC,"I most certainly agree with the honourable gentleman, we have seen over the past thirty odd years a heartbreaking fall from grace of many of our industrial heartlands. The lob sided nature of the UK is hideously unfair and is why I agree with the honourable member that we need to look at further revival of our industrial heartlands while recognising we must not damage our environment. This means more than the gentrification of the old mills, which maybe pretty and good to see the protection and repurposing of the fabric of the roots modern Britain, it means wide scale revival of employment oppotunities. High tech investment is attracted to the Great Western corridor due to a complex past revolving around Mr Hitler's decision to bomb London and the governmeng choosing to relocate is research and development to the Thames Valley; however, this doesn't mean we can't revive the industrial heartlands. We have the chance to turn the north into a hub of technological excellence when it comes to green technology which is something that I want to work tooth and nail to see happen in this grand region of the UK. It maybe a far cry from the smog filled scenes of the industrial revolution, however I believe we can turn the prospects of the region around in a renaissance based around modern technologies, especially with some of the greatest universities in the country in the region! And while it may not all fall within my remit, I intend to do what I can to support this. Modernising the norths Victorian trunk rail routes, ensuring that the new prosperity can be accessed by all and the distributed around the country. I shall certainly be discussing this with the chancellor and the Secretary of State for Business and Industry."
MHOC,3dv94o,I_miss_Chris_Hughton,2,Tue Jul 21 01:34:12 2015 UTC,"reducing domestic air travel and increasing rail travel. It is for this reason that this government sees a far more exciting opportunity and while it may not be as sexy as a new runway, it will be far more beneficial.   This might be your perfect dream, but in the real world air travel will always beat rail travel for the average person looking to go from Edinburgh to London.  Now, I have went and looked at ScotRail and EasyJet to see which would be better for somebody who wishes to travel down to London.  ScotRail  http://gyazo.com/151c2f8ba6b881eeca5bcaf74150f7dc  EasyJet http://gyazo.com/0fbc6cc7563fb8eb58d372317992e467  So on every measure that matters to a normal bloke EasyJet outperforms ScotRail. They can either spend 4 hours of their day and £66 if they go by rail, or spend about an hour and half of their day and £41 of their money. The choice is clear.  So, to fix this ""problem"" you either need to make domestic flights vastly more rare, using interference by the state or some how get faster trains or artificially inflate the prices on the airlines.  That doesn't even take into account how much more people would be willing to spend to save 3 hours of their life, I know I would be willing to spend more than the cost of a train to fly if I was doing it."

However I do think we should look to reduce the number of vehicles which operate in London.

How is a new runway going to mitigate the effects of climate change? You are long term in the sense you look at one transect and try to apply your ideology in the long term there.

Most good carbon forecasts in relation to airports factor in lower polluting aircraft and yet the commission itself said that if we went ahead with Heathrow for example it would cause targets in relation to pollution to be missed.

This bill aims to get to the root of the problem by removing the useless subject ICT from the curriculum and replacing it with the academic study of computer science. With the world economy becoming more and more focused on technological industries we need to ensure the next generation can succeed by giving them the opportunity to learn about how the systems that run the world really work instead of just how to use them. The only way to build a bright future for our country is to invest, long-term in skills, a key conservative ideal and one i hope no one would disagree with.

I can't help but feel that you're rushing it a bit to have year 7 and 8 pupils studying Java, C# etc at all, let alone from next year.   F. If a child continues with Computer Science to GCSE they must be able to demonstrate a working knowledge of the following aspects:  Two Level 2 Languages  Relational Databases With SQL  Object Orientated Programming   So you're putting a requirement on what pupils must have to be able to take a subject?

MHOC,3dvac5,DrNyan,3,Sun Jul 19 22:19:41 2015 UTC,"The principal of this bill is incredibly important, many of the skills taught in ICT are incredibly basic and/or outdated and often times are skills that most children have a solid grasp on already.  However, ignoring the fact that this piece of legislation is littered with informal language, I think it is a bit far to have all KS3 students learn a level 2 language in a school year.

Children will also be taught to touch type on a “QWERTY” keyboard by the age of 11   Trying to ""teach"" typing is by no means the best way of going about this. Simply using a computer and keyboard often will eventually get a child familiarised with where the keys are and typing speed will increase. This is a far more natural way of doing it as opposed to a forced ""teaching"" method. I would propose a rewording to ""C. Children should be proficient in using a ""QWERTY"" keyboard by the age of 11.""  My second concern is with the focus on learning languages.    If a child continues with Computer Science to GCSE they must be able to demonstrate a working knowledge of the following aspects:  Two Level 2 Languages   In programming the primary importance is not in remembering syntax. Once you understand one language its not that hard to learn another, you just need to memorise all the syntax. Instead the most important part is the logical reasoning and problem solving to be able to write a program. You can know a language, but that's not going to be very helpful if you don't have the logic to be able to turn that syntax into a program. I don't think that learning 2 level two languages is necessary. Reducing it to 1 will allow far less time to be spent on learning syntax and more time on becoming more proficient in the skills needed to actually code."

I get that ICT may be in need of an overhaul, but insisting that programming be taught to that level is overkill.   I'd support teaching basic programming then letting them decide how much further they want to go.  Also, section 1 subsection e has to be a joke.  There's no way it's actually serious.   I learned to use Word 20 - 25 years ago.  Beyond the changes to the GUI, its not actually changed, so instead of   these skills will be obsolete by the time they enter the workplace   Being true, we'll be sending kids out into the workplace knowing how to programme stuff, if they need to know that or not, but without a decent working knowledge of the software they will actually be using the majority of the time.  Things that help teach programming is good.   Things that mandate programing are absolutely not.  Things that mandate replacing a working knowledge of products that are widely used and replacing that with programming are extremely narrow minded.

You can attempt to teach up to a level of competence, expecting not everyone is going to be able to do it.  In the US, CPR is becoming mandatory, to be taught and students to be certified by the certifying authority.

But the fact is that most, for example, word processing software is the same (I have two such programs on my computer) so why say nonsense like what is taught now will be obsolete when kids leave school when that clearly isn't true?  That section is clearly and blatantly not needed.  (Not for nothing, the only mention of any skills not programming is well down the bill.)  I think I quite clearly stated that I thought that programming should be taught to a basic level then let the individual child decide.

Once you get the child to a passion level, there should be more and more that should be taught and it really shouldn't end.  that education should be transferable and translatable to the college of their choice."

A significant number of office based jobs will rely on Microsoft Office, particularly Microsoft Excel, to the extent that familiarity is a necessity. While teaching the latest bells and whistles of each new version is unnecessary a strong working knowledge of the main three Office programmes (Excel, PowerPoint, Word) is very important both in boosting pupils opportunity to enter the workplace and enhancing their ability to apply those programmes to their academic work at school and beyond."

As I have stated in my own criticism of the bill, the logical reasoning and problem solving is the far more important part of programming, syntax is of lesser importance.

All officially recognised Teacher Unions must be offered at least 1 seat on the council.   Absolutely, categorically, no. We should not politicize exams like this. Adding Teachers unions, some of which are highly ideological and it is absurd to include the unions in the process. Have teachers involved by all means, but not the unions themselves, they are far too political to be involved in this.    3.5 Pupils will have the option to retake any A2 Level exam between 1 and 3 times.

All Coursework is to be independently marked   Do we defiantly have the resources to have them marked like this? We can barely cope with marking exams. Also, coursework needs to be marked by a teacher in the subject, to ensure that they get the intricacies and nuances in the subject and the coursework. I would also argue, having a student's teacher marking is better because they will better understand the students work structures and way of writing. I know as someone who has had issue with essays questions in exam in the past, with examiners not understanding what im saying (in part because of my awful structure due to being dyslexic), while my teacher reds it when we get it back, and she understand perfectly. Within a exam this is acceptable, but coursework is not supposed to be like this.

Coursework will be marked independently by the NEBE and it will be funded accordingly.   I don't agree with your thoughts on marking. I think we need to apply the same level of rigor to Coursework as we do Exams and we also need to take pressure of Teachers to give them more time to teach. As with exams, the markers will of course specialize in the subject they are marking.  Pupils with learning difficulties are able to get their exams and coursework marked to take into consideration the difficulties they have if they apply for learning support. This will of course continue to be the case for coursework.

Individual teachers getting involved hear and their is one thing, but an organised voice is something we really cannot ignore."
MHOC,3dqeq3,theyeatthepoo,2,Sat Jul 18 16:37:07 2015 UTC,I don't see the need. Teachers aren't complaining that exam boards are ignoring them and the Unions bring disadvantages while not addressing any particular problem. The single largest Union would hold all the power at the expense of the other Unions who may be national Unions. Should English only Unions have any say on courses such as Welsh or Scottish. Really this is only complicating the already complex process of forming exam papers.

Including teachers does not mean including unions. The two, oddly enough, are mutually exclusive.    Schools have the resources for this.   Where?"
MHOC,3dqeq3,thewriter1,2,Sat Jul 18 18:22:22 2015 UTC,I must concur with the Honourable Members concerns over the inclusion of Union representatives.

The Unions that exist for teachers are not the same as teachers themselves, and have a clearly polticised role in society.

MHOC,3dqeq3,AlbrechtVonRoon,9,Mon Jul 20 15:15:24 2015 UTC,5.9. NEBE is to be the Examination board responsible for setting and awarding all Secondary level qualifications for LEA and Non-LEA controlled schools in England including but not exclusively;   National 5s Highers Advanced Highers    Why is the National Exam Broad of England setting the level and awarding Scottish Educational Qualifications? I am pretty sure that the Scottish Qualifications Authority still exists.
MHOC,3dqeq3,Duncs11,2,Sat Jul 18 13:13:52 2015 UTC,There are some circumstances in which those qualifications could be taken within England. But as it clearly states NEBE will only be responsible for Exams in England.
MHOC,3dqeq3,theyeatthepoo,4,Sat Jul 18 13:26:19 2015 UTC,"So we could end up with the situation you are trying to get rid of, in which we could essentially have qualifications in which, the standard and work varies depending on what side of a sign you are on.  I'd assume that the amount of Scottish Qualifications being taken in England would be reasonably small, so why not just give the SQA the responsibility for them, therefore the qualification standard is the same."
MHOC,3dqeq3,Duncs11,2,Sat Jul 18 13:36:22 2015 UTC,"OK, that seems like a sensible idea. I will change that in the third reading."

There's nothing wrong with strengthening unions, but at least give them something somewhat related to their purpose."
MHOC,3dqeq3,N1dh0gg_,3,Sat Jul 18 22:50:59 2015 UTC,Teachers unions are a collaborate of the teaching profession and its collective knowledge and power. They are the very people we should wish to be helping to decide exam content.
MHOC,3dqeq3,MorganC1,2,Sat Jul 18 23:16:31 2015 UTC,"As someone who's family was in education, i can say that the Teachers' Union was primarily a political institution built for lobbying than the ""meeting of the minds"" you assume it to be.  If you want to put teachers on the boards, put teachers on the boards directly, perhaps those who are recognised as acceptional by their colleagues."
MHOC,3dqeq3,N1dh0gg_,3,Sat Jul 18 23:34:22 2015 UTC,"And how would we recognise these teachers in such a way? Maybe a grouping of all those in the profession, able to democratically carry out decisions and push the agenda they believe to be appropriate.  A union, if you would."
MHOC,3dqeq3,MorganC1,2,Sat Jul 18 23:52:30 2015 UTC,There's a difference between a union recognising members and sending them to the board  to be considered and unions getting mandatory spots on testing boards just because they happen to exist.
MHOC,3dqeq3,N1dh0gg_,2,Sat Jul 18 23:57:34 2015 UTC,"I would argue that these boards would be reluctant to accept union members otherwise. We see it commonly in our society today. By ensuring union participation, we ensure teachers are involved."

MHOC,3dqeq3,thewriter1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:47:47 2015 UTC,No I do not. Teachers being placed in these roles through their respective unions is a fair and more democratic method then the one you propose.

MHOC,3dqeq3,GhoulishBulld0g,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:19:47 2015 UTC,The Act comes into force in 2016 with the aim of establishing NEBE by the summer of 2017. I think that's a fair time line.
MHOC,3dqeq3,theyeatthepoo,4,Sun Jul 19 12:09:01 2015 UTC,"Section 4.2 would seem in many cases to severely degrade the actual value of coursework beyond simply being a sop to those who don't like exams. A key example of this is in subjects like science and geography where for coursework to cover elements of the discipline which exams cannot, namely investigation and experimentation, activity outside school conducting surveys and data collection are vital. From my own experience even in History GCSE, coursework included field trips to historic sites. Does this Bill intend simply to reduce coursework to only extended abstract essays?  Similarly this provision seems to exclude work outside school on any coursework. This presents the obvious problem of taxing both school resources, such as libraries and IT, which during  presumably limited assigned coursework time will need to serve entire classes of pupils, but also teaching time itself. If pupils must only complete coursework while in school it will require major chunks of time that could otherwise be used for teaching to be set aside. Similarly precluding students from undertaking independent study on coursework would seem to inhibit those willing to make more effort in pursuit of higher quality work and a better grade.  Both of these concerns only highlight the immense impracticality, let alone cost, of the following Section 4.3. The need to provide invigilators for every moment in which coursework is undertaken would require a significant amount of manpower for extended periods throughout the school year. Supplying invigilators in such numbers and so often would need either a massive reliance on volunteers or a dedicated paid body of staff. A volunteer force would raise major issues of labour supply and training, while a paid one would obviously have high personnel and training costs.  Considering the stated aim of this Bill is to extend the opportunity of coursework to all pupils these limits seem bizarre and almost calculated to make coursework impossible in most instances."
MHOC,3dqeq3,tjm91,3,Tue Jul 21 06:38:44 2015 UTC,"In my view, making the coursework optional is not an improvement at all. We should be assessing our young on a set of criteria and keep that criteria the same for everybody, not making qualifications easier to get. If we are going to have coursework, then everyone should do coursework.  Also, I like SATS."
MHOC,3dqeq3,Jas1066,2,Sat Jul 18 13:34:27 2015 UTC,"Not every pupil is exactly the same, so it makes no sense to assess every single pupil in exactly the same way. Pupils express their intelligence, or lack of, in different ways and its important that we should give every pupil an equal chance to show examiners what they have learnt, instead of just rewarding those who are good at taking exams.   This is about creating a modern flexible exam system that has the aim of getting the best out of all pupils."
MHOC,3dqeq3,theyeatthepoo,3,Sat Jul 18 13:37:40 2015 UTC,"As you say, not every child is the same. My own brother is dyslexic and hates the very thought of exams. I on the other hand love them. However, It does make sense to assess every pupil in exactly the same way - personally I think that in many instances it is best that we have a mix of both Exams, Coursework and Continuous assessment - and therefore know how every student compares to a set of criteria. If I have one student who does coursework and another who does exams, they are essentially doing separate courses, which is logistically impossible for less popular subject, particularly in smaller schools."
MHOC,3dqeq3,Jas1066,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:21:31 2015 UTC,"With the creation of the NEBE along with the proper investment to go alongside it, it will not be logistically impossible for students to be given these choices. Remember, the only decision the student makes is if they want to include the coursework option or not. So each subject will just have to have to paths available. This is very achievable and not particularly ambitious."
MHOC,3dqeq3,theyeatthepoo,2,Sat Jul 18 16:17:42 2015 UTC,"And where would this investment come from?  And yes it would be logistically impossible. You simply can not have the same course with different amounts of Coursework, so you would have to have separate courses; this would mean teachers having to be trained in the separate courses and we would have to have classes divided."
MHOC,3dqeq3,Jas1066,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:24:39 2015 UTC,Each student would be presented with two options. The coursework option and the non-coursework option. It's not logistically difficult.
MHOC,3dqeq3,theyeatthepoo,2,Sat Jul 18 16:34:55 2015 UTC,Its not that simple. How would you teach the effectively different courses in the same lesson?

MHOC,3dqeq3,tyroncs,2,Sat Jul 18 21:31:06 2015 UTC,"Opening Speech  Mr Deputy Speaker,  I have listened to the kind advice offered by members from all sides of the house and have made several important changes to the bill. Below, I will outline the important points to understand about this bill.   Coursework is an option for all students, it is not compulsory.  Requirements regarding coursework relate to the two years of GCSE study and the two years of A-Level study, students do not have to produce pieces of coursework for all their subjects in their last year and no student should be put in this position.  SATS have been abolished and consequently so have school league tables.  New regulations have been brought in to regulate coursework and make sure that it provides students with the same level of rigor as normal exams. A new nationalised examination board is to be created and will eventually be responsible for all secondary level (Secondary School & Sixth Form) examinations in England.    I would also like to remind all members that when writing legislation we are not required to legislate for every possible eventuality as what areas we do not legislate on continue to be subject to the same rules and regulations that existed before new legislation is presented.    /u/theyeatthepoo"

MHOC,3dqeq3,wwesmudge,4,Sat Jul 18 16:18:11 2015 UTC,"not at all, having a school league system encourages competitiveness and a strive to improve. OFSTED also helps deliver that, but I don't really like the way OFSTED operates."
MHOC,3dqeq3,Tim-Sanchez,2,Sat Jul 18 16:31:36 2015 UTC,"Firstly may I commend /u/theyeatthepoo on actually taking on board the advice given in the first reading and building upon it. I feel this has been somewhat brushed over as my colleagues raise (valid) concerns, but this bill clearly shows it has adapted to reflect the criticisms of the first reading. In particular I believe 4.3 is an excellent change.  That said, I do share the concerns that some schools might struggle to offer the variety of coursework at GCSE-level when teachers are already stretched. I'm sure this is a concern that could be addressed as time goes on though, it's not a dealbreaker for me by any means.  I must share the concerns of /u/demon4372 though, whilst I believe a unified exam board is a solid idea, unions on the council do make me uncomfortable."

MHOC,3dqeq3,Tomtom_988,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:20:12 2015 UTC,"May I raise the point that allowing students to take coursework ""at any time over the period in which students study for their GCSE’s in year 10 & year 11"" may be an issue with schools and logistics, especially as a coursework invigilator must be there when they are completing it. What I mean is that it may be difficult to organize with students all completing their coursework at different times.  Aside from that I like the idea of not forcing students to do coursework, I myself detested coursework. However how will subjects such as Modern Foreign Languages fare without coursework in speaking for instance? Will it just be replaced with a single speaking exam? Would students be forced to take coursework for languages?   Could you also forecast costs for the NEBE? It seems like a large and expensive project to me."
MHOC,3dqeq3,theyeatthepoo,2,Sat Jul 18 15:28:24 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I think you've misunderstood some of the bill. Students will be presented with two options for each subject. The coursework option and the non-coursework option. Schools will then have the option to set the coursework to take place at any time over the two GCSE's years. This is to avoid clashes or a build up deadlines.   No students will be forced to take coursework for any subject.  I will cost the bill in the third reading. It will be an expensive project, but one that the country can afford."

MHOC,3dq3ic,Tomtom_988,4,Sat Jul 18 15:35:46 2015 UTC,Are there any costings for this bill?
MHOC,3dq3ic,AlbertDock,2,Sat Jul 18 10:35:05 2015 UTC,"Overall revenue from court sources is less than £50 million, so any extra costs are likely to be minimal."
MHOC,3dq3ic,Zoto888,2,Sat Jul 18 12:43:08 2015 UTC,"It seems that   (2) Reiterating; Court fines in the context of late fine-repayments will be abolished.  (3) New methods shall be either; Legal Aid, or self-representation at the discretion of the defendant.   means the same thing as   (1) This House decides that it is hereby no longer moral to; and therefore make court fees on top of fines abolished - this shall therefore be covered by either legal aid, or allowing the individual to represent themselves free of charge."
MHOC,3dq3ic,mcr3527,2,Sat Jul 18 10:23:55 2015 UTC,It's unclear if this applies to all courts or just in criminal cases. Could you clarify?
MHOC,3dq3ic,AlbertDock,2,Sat Jul 18 13:35:26 2015 UTC,The principle upon which this Bill has been written in unquestionably honourable and with a few adjustments to its execution il be voting Aye.
MHOC,3dq3ic,theyeatthepoo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:31:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with the sentiment of the bill, as a court fee on top of a fine is essentially a second punishment for a single crime. However, all of the information in Section 2 is given in a), and simply reworded in b) and c) - this is unnecessary."
MHOC,3dpx9c,NoPyroNoParty,19,Sat Jul 18 08:21:24 2015 UTC,May I ask the Speaker if he has any plans for the 4th of October?
MHOC,3dpx9c,RoryTime,10,Sat Jul 18 09:04:18 2015 UTC,"I don't believe I do, can I ask why the 4th?"

MHOC,3do7wo,NoPyroNoParty,4,Fri Jul 17 21:50:02 2015 UTC,Wonderful bill with a wonderful reason. No one can object now surely.
MHOC,3do7wo,akc8,2,Sat Jul 18 00:01:18 2015 UTC,Thank you also for your support!
MHOC,3do7wo,Djenial,4,Sat Jul 18 00:16:43 2015 UTC,This bill seems to do what is necessary to protect our helium.
MHOC,3do7wo,Omnysia,3,Sat Jul 18 14:31:31 2015 UTC,"Changelog from 1st to 2nd reading:   Tightened up the definition of leisure activities, to encompass the use of helium in advertising, party balloons, high altitude filmography and meteorological studies, as hydrogen can be used as a much better replacement. Defined normal temperature and pressure for helium gas has been defined as a pressure of 1 atmosphere and a temperature of 273ºK, or -.015ºC. Defined normal temperature and pressure for liquid helium has been defined as a pressure of 1 atmosphere and a temperature of 4ºK, or -269.15ºC. Defined a leisure canister of helium as any canister that has less than 65% helium. Added a clause which guarantees hospitals, universities, schools and companies a price at 20% below the current minimum. It has been made clear that the minimum price for the helium canister only applies to the 65% or less quantity of helium, not the entire canister. The minimum price for both liquid and gas helium has been raised by around 15%. A surcharge of £75 per percentage point of helium for leisure purposes sold by retailers has been added.   /u/Djenial"
MHOC,3do7wo,purpleslug,3,Fri Jul 17 21:50:58 2015 UTC,We must conserve helium. I agree with the sentiment of this bill

MHOC,3do7wo,purpleslug,2,Fri Jul 17 22:01:14 2015 UTC,"It's entirely logical from what I see, so I'm happy to endorse it"

Helium though formed by fusion in stars constitutes a tiny percentage of our atmosphere; with helium extraction becoming harder and our reserves running out, this bill will take the unfortunate but necessary steps to ensure that the precious supply of this element isn't squandered too frivolously."
MHOC,3do7wo,thedexer102,3,Sat Jul 18 06:59:48 2015 UTC,The conservation of Helium is vital and I'm glad to see provisions are made for academic institutions performing research are given concessions by this bill. Truly laudable.

This is already the law.  Such positions are advertised as self employment opportunities. Thus those in these positions are not employed by the company they work for. As such they fall outside the scope of the  minimum wage regulations. While I would agree that such practises are immoral and should be stopped this bill will not stop them."

I believe there was 1 opposing MP in the discussions on the Opposition Subreddit (as well as another OO MP in this thread now), so the author of the bill felt it was better suited as a UKIP bill due to there being more support for it in the party. With bills that are likely going to be passed regardless ensuring that it is submitted as an 'Official Opposition' bill isn't that important."

MHOC,3dnigl,wwesmudge,3,Sat Jul 18 02:01:16 2015 UTC,"Opening Speech  My intention with this bill is to fight the exploitation of young workers in this country. In this current job economy, young people are finding it hard enough to get good work and start earning. What makes the situation more difficult is companies and employers misleading or enticing young people looking for work, in positions where they are exploited for their time and labour.  Jobs with no base wage or ""commission only"" jobs leave young people with very little money in their pocket, way below the minimum wage. Unpaid internships are also exploited as young people are in positions for sometimes up to a year, without receiving any form of income. It's the modern day slave trade which companies think they can get away with because young people are willing and desperate to find any form of work they can in this job economy, but it has to stop.  I'm proud to introduce this bill, with my party's support, that will make a strong positive impact to the lives and earnings to many young people. I hope that this effective action will be supported by all of those in this house who want to improve the working environment in this country.   Thank You.  /u/wwesmudge"

MHOC,3dnigl,Totallynotapanda,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:44:54 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this bill.  I believe that if we stopped businesses from hiring unpaid interns, they wouldn't decide to pay their interns. Instead, in a move to save money, they would likely just stop their internship schemes. This would be terrible as many need these internships to gain valuable experience in their particular field.  Furthermore, if someone wants to be an unpaid intern, they should have the freedom to do so. They may simply need the experience in order to progress in their career or they may not be able to get a paying job. However I feel that it is better for people to be unpaid on an internship, getting the experience they need, rather than them sitting at home unable to get a job.  I will be voting Nay to this bill."
MHOC,3dnigl,GhoulishBulld0g,2,Fri Jul 17 20:36:04 2015 UTC,"I don't know about you, but I can't name a single person that 'wants' to be an unpaid intern. They want to be an intern, but they accept the fact that they will have to go unpaid. They don't want this to be the case. This legislation will change that."
MHOC,3dnigl,wwesmudge,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:26:25 2015 UTC,"Oh, of course everyone would rather be paid. However, I feel that people will not have that option. I believe that companies will not want to pay interns and will get rid of the system altogether, and after all, it is better that people can get unpaid internships than none at all."
MHOC,3dnigl,Mepzie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:29:12 2015 UTC,I would say it is better they get paid or that the internships are at least government regulated. In Ireland they have a program called Jobsbridge. It is a scheme whereby people on the Dole can intern for 8 months (I believe) and will receive €50 on top of their dole payment per week. It has been having some teething problems but the underlying principle behind it is solid.  Any old company being allowed to have unpaid internships is simply wrong. It should be government regulated in so that every internship is a genuine opportunity for those that wish to learn to do so. Basically that you won't be doing a minimum wage job for nothing.   I am of the opinion that we either abolish unpaid internships altogether or regulate them.

However, it does help the unions to stop any unfair exploitation of workers before the situation worsens and within seven days the workers will be entitled to vote so they can decide then.  Though this effective in cases where there is the support from workers and in exceptional circumstances where it isn't, workers from the union will have the ultimate say."
MHOC,3djiit,Politics42,2,Thu Jul 16 20:17:52 2015 UTC,An emergency action is very different to a normal strike.  Emergency actions need to be taken quickly and the fact postal ballots are required makes it far too slow and cumbersome.

MHOC,3djiit,thewriter1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:06:02 2015 UTC,Strikes happen when workers don't feel they are getting a fair deal.  In recent years the workers in local and notional government have been badly treated. In RL we see workers limited to one percent for the next four years while MPs have received a ten percent rise.  The recent tube strike happened because after months of trying to get TFL to the table to discus the changes needed for a 24hr tube. Management put their proposals on the table and gave the unions two hours to accept the offer. I believe strike was deliberately induced for political reasons. As a government we have a responsibility to treat our workers with respect. I'm sure all ministers will do what they can to ensure this happens in the future.
MHOC,3djiit,AlbertDock,2,Fri Jul 17 11:25:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, we should treat workers fairly, but they should act accordingly. When the tubes go on strike what happens? No can get to work and get angry. Great say the leftists, people will rally to our cause. No, says everyone else, stop being irresponsible.   Strikes have lost the capacity to work effectively, and have done since the end of the 1980's. The Unions must get it through their heads that they have to change with the times - they cannot bully everyone into submission anymore.   How does this play into the bill? Again, the question of militants. What this Bill allows for is for them to hold a lot more power than they ought to - all that has to happen is them being there in greater numbers than everyone else. That's not right."

Full strikes shall require balloting in line with non-emergency industrial actions in other trades.   I'm grateful that this has been changed from what it was, but I feel that you have modified begrudgingly and not really thought of how to word it well. It would be useful if you defined what you meant by emergency workers and I don't understand why you've used 'national workers'? Does this mean that if there is a spare surgeon in Wakefield they can go on strike in the emergency department in Swansea? It makes sense for non-emergency work to an extent, but not emergency services. They should be broken into individual clauses. Emergency medical care is on a very limited time frame as you well know, it would be well if emergency strikes, by emergency workers, were partial and did not threaten the lives of innocent and ill people (who I think should be a consideration), for example if there were people qualified and able to maintain care of patients at short notice.

On the rest, it appears this bill would give carte blanche to the leadership of any union to call a week long for any reason at any time. This is madness.  Furthermore I suspect this bill won't have the effect the government thinks it will. After months or years of wildcat strikes - sorry, emergency industrial action - I suspect most of the public will once again lose faith in our unions' place in the economy and invite Thatcher 2.0 back into Downing Street.

This is not a two week strike without members approval. For members a strike costs them money, if a steward were to call them out at the drop of a hat the steward would soon be replaced. Whether  or not a Thatcher 2.0 emerges is down to how well the union can present it's case to the public. Much of that is down to the press, which the unions can do little about. The recent tube strike is a good example. The strike was over the way to move to a 24hr underground service. After months of trying to get TFL to the table the unions were give two hours to either reject or accept an offer.  The strike was not about money, but about shift rotas and notice of change of shift. so whether or not we get a Thatcher MKII is more a case of the unions getting the truth out, rather than a reason not to proceed with legislation which is needed. If the press have to be forced to tell the truth we will have to consider legislation to make them."
MHOC,3djiit,AlbertDock,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:46:31 2015 UTC,"Admittedly I did copy my response from what I gather was the first reading 5 months ago.   The emergency strike section has been somewhat rejigged but it is still not ideal. We don't live in an era with no employee rights anymore and I can't foresee a circumstance where an emergency strike will be necessary over a simple ballot or regular strike.   The fact is that unions - and this applies more to the larger unions - are political entities, and will act thusly, and giving then carte blanche to call 24hr strikes (at least) without a ballot is unnecessary and dangerous. There really is a threat that this will lose the public's confidence in unions and bite the government on its backside.   And what if secondary action?"
MHOC,3djiit,bnzss,2,Fri Jul 17 06:47:55 2015 UTC,"Any action enacted under the emergency strike rules could be challenged by a company in the courts, and they could seek damages if the court deemed it was not an emergency. So I would not envisage unions using it without good cause."

MHOC,3djiit,InfernoPlato,6,Thu Jul 16 21:32:19 2015 UTC,Emergency industrial action is by it's very name an emergency.  A postal ballot takes time. Shop stewards cannot use this option unless they can show that the delay of a postal vote jeopardises their members interests.
MHOC,3djiit,AlbertDock,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:57:22 2015 UTC,Yes and this is literally initiated by those in the workplace.

Secondary Action should not be allowed to happen, even if you believe in the unions. It serves no purpose other than to disrupt and harm the businesses that have done nothing wrong, only to show some vague statement of support to other people. It should be completely and utterly clear why it was banned, we cannot have the country held to a standstill by Secondary Action.  This bill only allows the Country and normal hard working people to be bullied about by idiotic union bosses, and I urge all members of this house to vote against it, and all of my fellow peers in the lords to defeat it as well."

This is not due to a bias, but simply the fact that in most situations, people don't really take much of an issue. In this sense you are right, as action seems to be taken only when someone takes offence, rather than when an actual personal attack takes place.  If we are to have good debate, then we need to ensure that the issue at hand is well addressed. Personal attacks consist of defaming a persons character rather than addressing the content of the debate. It has nothing to do with personal offence taken. For example, misgendering is not a personal attack, regardless of if personal offence is taken."

We do not have a blacklist of words or phrases, and instead work on a basis of common sense and common courtesy, which I feel is absolutely necessary given the medium of our engagement.    While I agree that in every sense working on a basis of common sense and courtesy is the correct way to manage communication rather than blacklisting words, I feel the rather peculiar list of banned words in the real House of Commons one of those archaic parts of Parliament's centuries of thick tradition that make it what it is.

Defence spending is now 1.7% GDP  This is now well below the 2% GDP standard that NATO sets for us.   Why have you allowed this to happen? How can you justify this?"
MHOC,3de50i,willo77,6,Wed Jul 15 16:37:23 2015 UTC,"That was not a cut: military spending, even excluding space and foreign aid spending, was increased by £1.1 billion.

At any rate, I believe that the 2% recommendation is far in excess of what is needed in the modern, globalised, and high-GDP world.

MHOC,3de50i,Mepzie,6,Wed Jul 15 16:10:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not particularly sure why the arbitrary figure of 50% is chosen, as opposed to 40% or 60%, but my answer shall be the same regardless.  To be begin with, as I pointed out when I released my statement, due to the nature of progressive taxation, only those earning over £210,000 pay more than 50% of their salary in tax.  Additionally, for lower incomes (anything beneath £150,000), the tax payed is still lower than before the passing of B008, due to the lack of payroll tax.  To illustrate this, consider the following:  A person earns £150,000 in salary, placing themselves firmly within the top 2% of earners.  Before B008, there was a national insurance rate of 12% on all income up to £150,000, a 20% bottom rate of tax, and a 40% higher rate of tax.  Overall, this individual would have paid £18,000 in national insurance, £36,800 in the higher rate of tax, and £8000 in the base rate of tax, for an overall tax burden of £62,800.  Under my new tax plans, only £47,000 shall be paid: £12,000 in the base rate, and £35,000 in the upper rate.    Furthermore, this tax burden represents just 31.3% of the individual's income, as opposed to 41.9% in the pre-B008 state."
MHOC,3de50i,Zoto888,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:45:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not particularly sure why the arbitrary figure of 50% is chosen, as opposed to 40% or 60%, but my answer shall be the same regardless.   I said 'over half' not half.   And your budget says this;   The higher rate of income tax shall be set to 50% (up from 45%), and the additional rate shall be set to 55% (up from 50%).  When combined with the changes to the personal allowance, one is still better off under the new tax regime up to the point of earning £140,000 per annum.   Therefore many people will be paying half of their wage to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. And I fundamentally disagree with this."
MHOC,3de50i,Mepzie,2,Wed Jul 15 20:17:29 2015 UTC,"I said 'over half' not half.    My point was that I'm not sure why it's ""over 50%"", and not ""over 40%"" or ""over 60%.   Therefore many people will be paying half of their wage    No, very few people will be.  That is the marginal rate of tax, the tax paid on each additional pound earned), not the overall rate of tax.  So for all income earned below £40,000, a 30% rate of tax would be paid, above £40,000, a 50% rate of tax, and that's before considering the Personal Allowance.  Therefore, someone earning, say, £50,000, would pay £13,400, which is not more than 50% of their wage under any stretch of the imagination.  I have no idea why this is so difficult to understand."

The claim is false, disingenuous, and disappointing to see from a Chancellor who I quite admire (despite his political leanings.)  As the Right Honourable Lord of Norton-sub-Hamdon /u/Willo77 has pointed out, the Defence budget is now actually a 1.7%.  The UK Space Agency (UKSA), in your Chancellors statement, was included in the defence budget despite not being defensibly oriented. Unless the Chancellor intends on breaking international treaties, I am sure we can agree it doesn't belong there.

MHOC,3de50i,Mepzie,6,Wed Jul 15 15:56:27 2015 UTC,"To start with, I'd be interested in seeing where the rise to 13.2% came from, as opposed to 25% from 20%, unless you're adjusting for some deductions? At any rate, as everyone in this Chamber is well aware, the value added tax is an indirect tax, and as such, the burden falls on the consumer, and not on the business.  However, as this VAT rise has funded our Citizen's Dividend programme, over 95% of people are better off even after the VAT changes, leading to increased spending in these small businesses by consumers."
MHOC,3de50i,Zoto888,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:35:57 2015 UTC,"Sorry that was a typo. It was meant to be 25% of course. And yes, of course VAT is an indirect tax, however this does not combat the immense struggle that small businesses will have with cashflow. Many small businesses may not be able to take out loans in order to cover this VAT increase and therefore will go into their overdrafts. I believe, therefore, that increasing VAT by 5% will be extremely negative for small businesses in this country."
MHOC,3de50i,Mepzie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:30:37 2015 UTC,What are you thoughts on the expertly written Welsh budget?

MHOC,3de50i,Politics42,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:27:16 2015 UTC,"Now that the Chancellor recognises the criticisms of the fiscal adjustments made in the budget, what does he believe is a reasonable reduction in the deficit as a percentage of GDP for this year?  What spending increases or revenue cuts would the chancellor propose to reduce the level of fiscal adjustment?"
MHOC,3de50i,JamMan35,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:49:48 2015 UTC,"I would propose removing the 3% ""Pension Tax"" in order to increase the after-tax disposable income of workers in society, and hence overall consumption and growth.  Alternatively, an increase in Citizen's Dividend value could accomplish the same goal, while also improving the efficiency of the job market by giving more breathing room to those looking for work."

MHOC,3dez00,Timanfya,6,Wed Jul 15 19:17:32 2015 UTC,"In his opening speech, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions gives his reason (singular) for this bill as ending the 'unfair bedroom tax'. However, the bill would repeal the entirety of the Welfare Reform Act 2007. Can he give reasoning for this and tell the house why he thinks the whole Act is bad?"
MHOC,3dez00,bigpaddycool,4,Wed Jul 15 19:35:03 2015 UTC,"Hear hear! To me, it stinks of him attempting to repeal a load of things under the veil of 'ending the bedroom tax', something he knows that will get some cross party support. Will the Rt Hon /u/AlbertDock confirm this isn't the case?"
MHOC,3dez00,TheQuipton,3,Wed Jul 15 19:37:39 2015 UTC,"Mr Speaker I can, and am delighted to, give such an assurance to the honourable member."
MHOC,3dez00,AlbertDock,3,Wed Jul 15 21:06:10 2015 UTC,"Following the Welfare reform act 2014 which this house approved, there is very little left of the 2007 act. Most of it's effects were rendered obsolete following the Welfare reform act. The party felt at the time that to include the bedroom tax would have been too much for one bill."
MHOC,3dez00,AlbertDock,2,Wed Jul 15 21:04:51 2015 UTC,Hear hear!
MHOC,3dez00,banter_lad_m8,9,Wed Jul 15 19:40:55 2015 UTC,"I think you'll find the 'Bedroom tax' was introduced in the Welfare Reform Act 2012, not the Welfare Reform Act 2007."
MHOC,3dez00,George_VI,7,Wed Jul 15 19:36:05 2015 UTC,The 2007 act introduced the AMHB (Appropriate maximum housing benefit) which is the basis for the bedroom tax. The 2012act was more concerned with the introduction of universal credit.
MHOC,3dez00,AlbertDock,8,Wed Jul 15 21:00:49 2015 UTC,"Well the formation of the welfare state was also the basis for the 'bedroom tax', you could follow a never ending line of legislation if you wanted.  The 2007 act introduced the mechanism by which the government could introduce the Under-occupancy penalty (as well as vastly improving housing benefit).  The 2012 act introduced the 'bedroom tax' that you dislike so much.  If you want to repeal the 2007 act then you'll have to repeal the 2012 act, not that there would be any reason to repeal either when the same thing you want to achieve could be done by introducing an amendment to the 2012 act."
MHOC,3dez00,George_VI,7,Wed Jul 15 21:18:22 2015 UTC,Following my Welfare Reform act 2015 there's very little left of the 2007 act apart from the bedroom tax. It makes sense to scrap the act and simplify the legislation.
MHOC,3dez00,AlbertDock,5,Wed Jul 15 21:22:47 2015 UTC,"Following my Welfare Reform act 2015   What is this?  I can find no evidence of it?  Unless you mean B111 which doesn't mention housing benefit.   there's very little left of the 2007 act apart from the bedroom tax Once again, the 'Bedroom Tax' is not in the Welfare Reform Act 2007.     Seeing as the Welfare reform act 2007 conflicts with B111, I have no idea how the Welfare Reform Act 2007 wasn't already repealed.   Still, if the 2007 act is being repealed then the 2012 act must be repealed as well which should suit you as that's the act that actually includes the Bedroom Tax.  Introduced a bill repealing both acts to cover this gaping legislative hole and remove the 'Bedroom Tax' as well as amending the parts of the 2012 act not covered in the amelioration bill.   Just repealing the 2007 act won't effectively remove the 'bedroom tax' and will make no legal sense as we still have the 2012 act."
MHOC,3dez00,George_VI,2,Wed Jul 15 21:36:18 2015 UTC,This is also what I am finding. I think this bill is looking to repeal the wrong law.
MHOC,3dez00,MoralLesson,4,Thu Jul 16 04:40:37 2015 UTC,"I am not a fan of the bedroom tax whatsoever and would wholeheartedly support scrapping it however I am rather displeased with how the Government have mislead people into believing that all repealing the Welfare Reform Act 2007 would do is scrap the bedroom tax. As can be seen by following the link to it the Welfare Reform Act 2007 goes beyond simply introducing the bedroom tax. For example it also introduced Employment and Support Allowance and outlined the requirements a claimant would have to meet in order to be given this allowance. Since this Bill would repeal the entire Act and not just the bedroom tax parts I am suspicious that there is an ulterior motive at play here, possibly making it easier for people to claim benefits."
MHOC,3dez00,banter_lad_m8,2,Wed Jul 15 19:39:29 2015 UTC,I can assure the honourable member I have no hidden agenda. In the Welfare Amelioration Act 2014 I dealt with the requirements for receiving benefit for those unfit to work. In this act I also deal with the recovery of over payments which was another part of the 2007 act.
MHOC,3dez00,AlbertDock,2,Wed Jul 15 20:59:20 2015 UTC,"There's much more than just that, do not forget that the 2012 Act also dealt with the Bedroom tax so that would need repealing too"
MHOC,3dez00,MrEugeneKrabs,4,Wed Jul 15 23:53:58 2015 UTC,I'd support this; the bedroom tax is abhorrent.
MHOC,3dez00,BrootishBeggar,7,Wed Jul 15 21:06:39 2015 UTC,"No. While the Bedroom tax is...flawed, shall we say? We should be pushing for reform, not repealing the whole thing."
MHOC,3dez00,Jas1066,2,Wed Jul 15 19:26:31 2015 UTC,"To say the bedroom tax is flawed is a huge understatement. It is a system which often ends up costing more money than it saves.  The cost though is not just in cash, but in young lives ruined."
MHOC,3dez00,AlbertDock,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:08:45 2015 UTC,"The point remains; in theory, and with reform, the bedroom tax will work."
MHOC,3dez00,Jas1066,9,Wed Jul 15 21:49:07 2015 UTC,"There are several problems with the bedroom tax. Firstly often there is no smaller accommodation available for people to move into. Without a massive social housing program this will remain. Secondly it removes people from the support network of friends and neighbours they have had for many years.  Without a huge increase in spending on social projects this will remain. Thirdly it produces ghettos, only areas with very low rents are available to tenants.  This results in poor achievement for the children which is a cost to us all. Finally if tenants know that they will be forced to leave a home once their child leaves home it gives them no incentive to look after or spend money on their home. While most these problems are solvable they need very large amounts of money over many years to fix."
MHOC,3dez00,AlbertDock,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:03:39 2015 UTC,"So amend it.  Apply it only if the local council offers a more appropriately sized property and it is refused, and exclude instances where someone is on disability benefit and has modifications to the property / equipment stored / etc.  In circumstances where alternate housing is available, it's a nonsense for the state to be paying to house people in properties far larger than they need."
MHOC,3dez00,ieya404,3,Wed Jul 15 22:03:12 2015 UTC,"If anyone can come up with a system for reallocation of housing I will look at it. So far I have seen none. Housing is a complex area, a growing problem is two families becoming one.  Take a situation where a couple get together and both have two children from a previous marriage. So we end up with two adults, and girl of ten and boys of sixteen, seventeen and eighteen. Five years later the two eldest boys each go their separate ways. They then have a spare bedroom and must move. A year later the remaining boy moves out and they have to move again. This can result in two moves in two years, just at a time when the youngest is taking exams which will determine her future."
MHOC,3dez00,AlbertDock,2,Wed Jul 15 22:20:02 2015 UTC,"Hear, Hear!"
MHOC,3dez00,GhoulishBulld0g,3,Wed Jul 15 19:31:41 2015 UTC,"Mr Speaker,   If my research is correct, this also will effectively repeal the Employment and Support Allowance, among other things.   Also I am unclear as to how exactly repealing this act returns the spare room subsidy. Can the Secretary of State quote the relevant section of the act, and also explain how its other provisions' repeal will impact welfare in the UK?"
MHOC,3dez00,bnzss,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:03:23 2015 UTC,Section 30 sets out the AMHB (appropriate maximum housing benefit) this is the basis on which the bedroom tax is based. Remove that and the bedroom tax goes.
MHOC,3dez00,AlbertDock,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:48:18 2015 UTC,"Okay, and what about the rest?"
MHOC,3dez00,bnzss,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:49:41 2015 UTC,The act also sets out conditions for the assessment for work which have been superseded by my own Welfare Amelioration Act. Repeal of the act will also go some way towards data protection because the act gives the secretary of state the power to deem anything as an investigation of fraud and so give them access to records. This I believe should be for the courts.
MHOC,3dez00,AlbertDock,3,Fri Jul 17 11:04:26 2015 UTC,"/u/AlbertDock   What the Welfare Reform Act 2007 did:   Housing Benefit paid to tenant instead of landlord Introduced a Housing Benefit sanction for those who are found guilty of anti-social behaviour  Replaced Incapacity Benefit with ESA, which among other things:   Attempted to force the ill and disabled into work Created work-capability assessments designed to humiliate and intimidate claimants out of claiming"
MHOC,3dez00,theyeatthepoo,3,Fri Jul 17 15:52:08 2015 UTC,"Opening Speech      The repeal of the Welfare Reform Act 2007 will end the unfair bedroom tax at a stroke. This tax has failed in it's intentions and has not saved any money.  It has resulted in thousands being thrown out of their homes and then put in emergency accommodation, which is more expensive than the homes they were in in the first place. It causes disruption to the children's education. For some children it means changing schools shortly before taking exams. These children will be paying the price for the rest of their lives.  Families are often being punished for not moving into housing which doesn't exist.   I ask every MP with a modicum of decency to support this bill.  /u/AlbertDock"

The argument ""just bring in meat if you're so desperate"" could just as easily be applied to ""just bring your own vegetarian meal"".  However, the difference is, A LOT more of the population are meat-eaters, and I believe that they should have the freedom to buy what food they want, and have it provided for them without intervention from the government.  Also, this will cost the restaurants not serving meat quite a considerable amount of money, as well as the campaign being paid for by taxes.  I don't think it is fair to put taxpayer's money towards something that prevents them from having a choice, or at least making it more difficult.  Awful motion."
MHOC,3daa0o,mcr3527,6,Tue Jul 14 19:05:32 2015 UTC,"the difference is, A LOT more of the population are meat-eaters    The difference is in fact that overconsumption of meat is bad for the environment and overeating beetroot is not.    I believe that they should have the freedom to buy what food they want,   They do, well more or less, there are lot's of foods you can't legally buy, but the Government canteens do not have to sell it to them. Does the canteen have an obligation to sell curry on a Friday because some customers want it, No. So why is it different with meat.   and have it provided for them without intervention from the government.   We are talking about Government canteens, it is all provided with state intervention.   put taxpayer's money towards something that prevents them from having a choice   It puts a very small amount of taxpayers money into protecting the environment, improving public health and combating global famine.

The idea of being an 'omnivore' is that you can also eat vegetarian food. Vegetarians cannot (I know they physically can, you know what I mean) eat meat, therefore this argument is completely invalid.   A LOT more of the population are meat-eaters   ...So?

Vegetarians cannot (I know they physically can, you know what I mean) eat meat, therefore this argument is completely invalid.   Being vegetarian is as much of a choice as choosing to eat meat, and those who want to eat meat for lunch should be able to, likewise somebody who doesn't want to eat meat is able to. This argument is completely invalid. I can't believe that you are denying that being vegetarian is a choice, like choosing to eat meat. This argument is far from invalid.   ...So?   This Green member has a good point that we need to cater for people's choices, especially if there are many of them   They simply have to pay for different food, they do not have to pay any more money.   Many people will NOT buy from somewhere not offering a meat option, more-so than from a place not offering a vegetarian option. It WILL lose money."
MHOC,3daa0o,TheInfernalRain,2,Tue Jul 14 19:17:27 2015 UTC,"Being vegetarian is as much of a choice as choosing to eat meat   Yes, it is. However, vegetarians are morally opposed to eating meat, whereas meat-eaters have no problem eating food that isn't meat.   This Green member has a good point that we need to cater for people's choices, especially if there are many of them   Again, I have to repeat my earlier point. Meat-eaters do not restrict themselves to solely meat, and can also eat other food, so what is the problem? Besides, meat-eaters are perfectly entitled to bring meat from home, or in fact, be served meat on any other day of the week.   Many people will NOT buy from somewhere not offering a meat option, more-so than from a place not offering a vegetarian option.    Is this out of spite, or out of an addiction to meat? If it is the first, then these people are ridiculous, and if it is the latter, then they need psychological treatment."

The vast majority of vocal critics to this motion need to seriously grow up. I myself must admit to eating meat with basically every meal. If I was encouraged to eat more vegetarian food, especially if there were lots of options available to me (options which will flourish to accommodate the increased demand!), the world would be just that little bit better - I would be healthier, there would be less reliance on a massive CO2 producing industry, and vegetarian options in restaurants would expand and flourish (hence encouraging further vegetarianism). And if this were extended throughout the public sector, these benefits would multiply relatively. We might even see some education happening to the ignorant about vegetarian matters, or possibly even increased awareness of animal rights etc etc. And on top of all that, there are plenty of vegetarian dishes which are tasty and nutritious.   I'm honestly not sure what I even expected, but I think I had higher hopes than 'MEAT IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR IS A PERSONAL FREEDOM' and 'I WILL GO CHIP SHOP MONDAY LOL' repeated ad nauseum."

So this will not be the last time I have to take a stand for people's personal freedom when it comes to dietary choices. I will, however, say this:  I support the right of any group of people to have their dietary needs or choices recognised by caterers, within reason. I support the right of vegetarians to be able to eat even though I would rather eat another member of this House than be a vegetarian myself. I would, therefore, expect other members of this House and society to respect my own choice, however misinformed, where I wish to be able to eat meat as part of a balanced diet, at every meal, and to have that recognised by caterers. I don't think that is unreasonable.  I will therefore be voting against this motion, and advise other members of the House to do the same."

We're respecting your choice by not stopping you from going almost anywhere else to eat. Contrary to what you might think, you do not have a right to eat meat. If I said 'I have a right to eat caviar and foie gras for 5 days of the week, why is the government oppressing me like this???', I'm sure you can see how it's a bit ridiculous. And let's face it, the only difference between 'meat' and 'cavier and foie gras' in this example is 'more people eat meat'."
MHOC,3daa0o,nonprehension,6,Tue Jul 14 21:31:43 2015 UTC,"Far too often I see people and their parties claim, from all corners of the house, to be passionate about fighting climate change and protecting the environment. Many of them recognise too that in order to make us sustainable as a society and leave a better future for our children we must all make small lifestyle changes where we can to tackle some of the biggest problems. Yet when it comes to putting their talk into action, they themselves haven't a care in the world. It's no wonder that political apathy and distrust of politicians is at an all-time high when they urge their people to make an effort for the good of all of us yet aren't prepared to change a ridiculously small amount of their pampered lifestyles to do the same.   If we are going to launch a campaign to reduce meat consumption and thus improve animal welfare standards and fight global warming, and we need to do so with urgency, it is only right and proper that we as politicians for once in our careers actually practice a bit of moral leadership and start by using it in our public buildings.  We are not banning all meat, we're not force feeding you quorn, we are literally changing what our canteen serves on one day a week. Bring in your own food if the idea of not fulfilling your lustful craving for meat is so abhorrent. If honourable and right honourable members can't even handle that then I fear for our future."

MHOC,3daa0o,AlmightyWibble,4,Tue Jul 14 20:51:46 2015 UTC,"I believe the right honourable member is incorrect.  I'd suggest that the number of animals slaughtered by the meat industry is in the order of 90,000,000,000 annually. One Blue whale eats about 40,000,000 krill each day. Estimates vary on the number of blue whales left, but 5,000 is probably an average figure. This means that blue whales alone kill and eat 73,000,000,000,000 animals every year. A figure which far exceeds the number killed by the meat industry."

There's a Subway, a McDonalds, and quite a few small businesses in close proximity to the Palace of Westminster if any of the staff or politicians are that desperate for meat.    morally reprehensible move which will make things much harder for the food industry    I fail to see what is morally reprehensible about standing up for animal welfare. I also fail to see how Parliament not serving meat on one day of the week will harm the food industry in such a way. In fact, this could provide a small boost to companies which manufacture vegetarian products.     giving consumers less choice on Mondays    This is not being extended to private companies and shops. This only applies to public buildings.   I won't even go into my feelings towards vegetarianism     While I don't wish to make assumptions it appears you are implying that you don't like vegetarians. Care to explain?    big government to tell food outlets which days they can or can't serve meat    We are not dictating to food outlets when they can and can't serve meat. We are telling public institutions when they can and can't serve meat. All in all I think that the honourable member has fundamentally misunderstood the motion and needs to read it again."
MHOC,3daa0o,Jas1066,8,Tue Jul 14 20:10:24 2015 UTC,"I am no friend to the meat industry, but the government's job is not to tell people what ideological tenants they should hold. If we as a government attempt to raise public awareness about the deeds of large corporations, we cannot do so in a way that singles out individual industries, i.e. the meat industry in this example.  This is not a bad initiative, but this CANNOT be an official programme of the Government."
MHOC,3daa0o,alexwagbo,3,Tue Jul 14 20:13:02 2015 UTC,"Opening speech  Meat consumption in this country is at the highest level it has ever been. The idea that we eat meat everyday, often several times a day if not at every meal, is not traditional to our way of life it is brand new, and its bad for us and worse for our planet.  In 1956 the average weekly intake of meat in Britain was 150g by 1976 it had risen slightly and gradually to 164g, now its 490g and in the US its a staggering 868g and the amount is increasing annually in both countries. (1,2, 3, 4)  On health grounds alone we should oppose this trend. Increased dietary intake of meat is linked to colon cancer (5), breast and prostate cancer (6), cardiovascular disease and an increased all cause morbidity and mortality. (7)  But it is the environmental effects of this overconsumption that  truly demand we take action now. The livestock industry is the third biggest contributor to green house gas emission and so a response to livestock framing is essential to combating climate change. We must get the our emissions of green house gases down, if we don't then in 40 years positive feedback kicks in and climate change will be an irreversible and unstoppable phenomenon. Basically, we have 40 years to cut back on meat, a lot, or the earth we cut back on it for us - it will submerge a lot of pasture land in polar melt water and turn more into desert forcing us to focus on crops as the most efficient way of making food. A shift away from livestock farming and meat heavy diets is supported by agricultural and environmental science (8) and by the UN agency for Food and Agriculture (9, we cannot afford to ignore these calls for action.  In addition to the overwhelming case for action to prevent climate change, overconsumption of meat has been shown to go hand in hand with deforestation (10), global famine and drought (11) and animal cruelty (12). These effects are largely caused by the gross land inefficiency of meat production for providing human calories, we cannot continue to eat fillet steak while the developing world starve as a consequence. We must use the land better so that everyone can eat and that spare land can be used to preserve natural wonders like the rainforests and other essential ecosystems.  The insatiable appetite for meat in our society has become deeply ingrained, it is not uncommon to hear people saying that a plate of food is not a meal without meat. We must challenge this cultural idea if we are to tackle meat production at all. That is why we propose a solution used by the Norwegian Army (12) to gently challenge the idea that meat is essential in every meal. This is not attack on liberty - nobody will be made to abstain from meat, they may bring meat with them to work or they may leave to buy it, it is merely a scheme to encourage a different way of thinking. We must question our love of meat and we must do it now before it is simply too late for our planet.  /u/whigwham"

MHOC,3daa0o,peter199,8,Tue Jul 14 19:23:27 2015 UTC,"I fully, 100% support with this bill. I think that it is an incredible step in improving the animal welfare, most certainly beneficial to the environment and a truly marvellous thing for the country. I cannot stress enough how much I want this motion to pass, and how much good it will do. I commend /u/whigwham for writing it, and hope other brilliant motions like this can also see the light of day."
MHOC,3daa0o,alexwagbo,5,Tue Jul 14 18:50:59 2015 UTC,"improving the animal welfare,   How on earth did you even get that? Just because there is an ever so slight dip in the demand of meat, it doesn't mean we are going to see sheep sheep and dog laying down together. If anything, this will simply lower prices, and encourage more cost cutting in the agriculture industry."

MHOC,3daa0o,nonprehension,3,Tue Jul 14 20:15:37 2015 UTC,Where is your reasoning for this outlandish claim?
MHOC,3daa0o,BrootishBeggar,2,Tue Jul 14 20:16:44 2015 UTC,"One is that it will help promote vegetarianism, and further normalise it and popularise it. Two is that it will most certainly lower the demand for meat. Now, whilst I respect the fact that you are Jas, I doubt that you can deny the fact that a lower demand for meat and more vegetarians can hurt animal welfare."
MHOC,3daa0o,m1cha3lm,4,Tue Jul 14 20:20:20 2015 UTC,"Just because there are less deaths, doesn't mean the animals welfare is any better. In Fact, as I said, if trade dries up, I can only see the pain suffered by animals while they are alive increase."
MHOC,3daa0o,TheSentientIguana,2,Tue Jul 14 20:23:54 2015 UTC,"You are failing to see the cultural significance of a high vegetarian population. If we have more vegetarians, animal welfare will be a far more prevalent issue, and it will be more accounted for from all parties."
MHOC,3daa0o,Rlack,3,Tue Jul 14 20:32:33 2015 UTC,I wouldn't quite agree with you there. There is already a lot of money to be made from making your business seem ethical. [1] [2]

Firstly, there is no way you would be able to implement this and that it would be accepted by the general public. Secondly, I doubt that this would do anything to reduce the consumption of meat and the number of animals that are butchered. Thirdly, there have been studies done that prove eating vegetarian is not better for the environment as water and other resources are still used to make the food."

MHOC,3daa0o,InfernoPlato,3,Tue Jul 14 21:29:11 2015 UTC,"On this bill, I would speak on my own accord and say despite our cooperation with our Green comrades, I would say that this is a bad idea for this country.  Instead of just instituting that meat shall be banned on mondays, shouldn't we be putting in place more useful bills that improve the conditions of animals, or protecting the environment they live in?  While what I suggested may not be the best course of action, there are many better ways to advance the condition of the United Kingdom instead of banning meat."
MHOC,3daa0o,TheInfernalRain,4,Tue Jul 14 21:33:05 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid I don't support this at all - if the further expansion of this motion comes into action, then you shall seriously impact the dietary liberty of students & anyone else who happens to be unfortunate enough to work in the public sector. This would just be overbearing control over the diet of millions of people in the UK, and is totally objectable on those grounds.  Although this is simply playing devils advocate, why not impose this upon private corporations? This motion would actually enshrine into law the superiority of private business over public business, and as a socialist I fundamentally disagree with that. By all means support vegetarianism and downplay the role of the meat market in society, but don't impose it upon people in law - that's just insensitive, overbearing and frankly, wrong.  Furthermore, I absolutely love ham & mustard sandwiches, and as a model parliamentarian this will greatly upset me."

This house believes that Parliament should take a stand on the contribution to climate change and other environmental concerns that comes for overconsumption of meat   I find it rather pathetic how you are trying to spin this into an environmental motion. As we can see here, agriculture is indeed a significan't contributor to the UK's greenhouse gas production. However, the Energy, Transport, Business and Residential sectors contribute more than the Agriculture Sector. Why has the government not yet submitted a single bill that aims to combat the production of gasses in any of those sectors so far this term? It is blatantly an attempt to cut down on the number of deaths of ""poor innocent cows"" and giving an alternative motive is just pandering to the more moderate parties.   by instigating a policy of not serving meat on one day of the working week - Monday   As was discussed briefly in DEFRA MQs (which was clearly read by the right honrabable member submitting this motion), there are significant reasoning behind a meat free day being on a friday, rather than a Monday when Sunday's Roast's Leftovers are often being made in to curries and pies. I urge the Prime Minister to take this in to consideration, if we are to proceed with this dreadful bill.   believes this policy should first apply to the restaurants, cafeteria and other food outlets of the Palace of Westminster and Whitehall departments   Oh, method in the madness! Hear hear, we should be encouraging ethical behaviour in the public sector, not forcing our moral codes on private individuals!   believes that this policy although not a large attack on climate change   You got that right.   will help to promote the broader cultural shift that will be a necessary part of an attempt to address the problem definitively   And you got that wrong. How many times do I have to say? Educate, don't legislate. We should be sending in a crackpot team of eco-fundamentalists to brainwash our kids into believing that somehow depriving themselves of bacon is good for the environment. If somebody wants to be a vegetarian, vegan or pesicatarian for ethical reasons I will not stop them; good on them for not going with the flow. However, forcing children and workers of the state to eat according to your ethical code is just preposterous. What if you were forced into eating halal meat? Different people have different sets of ethics, and as I said, this motion is blatantly not just for the environmental benefits."

What if you were forced into eating halal meat?   I wouldn't care one jot since there is no qualitative difference between halal and 'normal' meat, which you would know if you'd ever actually experienced it. Perhaps someone should force you to eat halal meat so you'd find this out sooner.   this motion is blatantly not just for the environmental benefits.   i literally don't understand how you can genuinely think this is a valid line of reasoning and not be baiting hard. in what sense is this not an environment based motion? are we just trying to force you to not eat meat once a week 'because'?

MHOC,3daa0o,demon4372,3,Tue Jul 14 20:36:06 2015 UTC,The restaurants around the Palace of Westminster serve claret everyday of the week (other wines are available). Of course you don't have sturgeon all the time because it's not always in season.
MHOC,3daa0o,TheInfernalRain,2,Tue Jul 14 22:38:31 2015 UTC,"Mr Speaker.  If the right honourable member wishes to set an example he is welcome to. However it cannot be right that he forces his ideas on others. Nor is this a good bill to promote the reduction in the consumption of meat, this bill may well have the opposite effect.  People often rebel when things are forced upon them, and this could mean people buy more meat overall. There are no costing for this bill, but there will be a cost. A large one. I would encourage members of UNISON and the NUT to negotiate for a ""No meat allowance"". Meat in the canteen or restaurant has been available for many years. I would therefore contend that it is covered under ""Custom and Practice"" and the withdrawal would be a change of contract. As such I believe members have a strong case in law."
MHOC,3daa0o,RandomPhotographer,2,Tue Jul 14 20:44:59 2015 UTC,"I think there are much better ways of dealing with damage to the environment than the government encouraging people to become vegetarians one day out of every seven.

MHOC,3daa0o,ieya404,2,Wed Jul 15 12:58:49 2015 UTC,Why Mondays and not the more traditional Fridays followed by some Christians? Some communities already serve fish or vegetarian dishes in accordance with this tradition so a push to give up meat on Fridays would likely have a better response.  I do not agree with this motion and would encourage all MPs to vote against it; this may make a good initiative but it is absolutely not the role of the government to attempt to enforce in its buildings and promote. However I cannot help but think that the Green Party has missed a trick here with proposed date.
MHOC,3daa0o,whigwham,2,Wed Jul 15 13:25:48 2015 UTC,"I think this legislation is great as it promotes Vegetarianism which will also help the environment, boost cultural awareness of vegetarianism and animal welfare. I could also go on about the health benefits of non-meat consumption however many people have probably heard this before. Sure this won't solve the problem but it's a step in the right direction. I think a better way to help the environment would be further regulation however just because this will make a small difference doesn't mean it should be dismissed."

Quite simply we cannot live without the natural world and so must protect it from the damage we would do to it.   Current law protects the environment by fining individuals and companies who damage the environment but all to often this is taken as the cost of doing business. A company can destroy an ecosystem safe in the knowledge that the profits gained from doing so will be higher than the Government's fine.  This bill stops that it makes individuals criminally responsible for the damage they or their company does to the environment, ensures that the full cost of restoring the environment after damage is recovered  and stops companies profiting as a result of doing damage.  The point of this bill is not to fill prisons with people who damage the environment it is to make people think about the natural world and not do the damage in the first place. It makes people think heavily about the cost and consequences of their actions. And it stops environmental damage being just the cost of doing business.  For the good of all of us and for nature itself we must do more to protect our environment before its just too late!"

They can weigh up the cost and the potential profits and make a decision safe in the knowledge that they personal take no risk, this is unacceptable.   How does one account for the sum total of any and all future sums levied against the offending party?   There is a legal principal that parties are protected from future changes in the law. It is rightly considered unfair to apply new law retroactively and so they are safe from this.   this surely wouldn't be true of a Green Government, would it?   We rule by law. I cannot, even as Green Prime Minister, decide that I will fine companies a big amount for harming the environment. The decision is taken by the courts based on statute and case law and this fact allows the companies legal team to advice the executive on potential liability.    how does one measure the ""full cost"" of ecosystem restoration?   This decision will be taken by the courts based either on precedent or independent valuation of the damages as is currently the case with criminal damages.   individuals ""criminally responsible,"" but the ""point is not to fill prisons with people who damage the environment."" Which is it, Prime Minister?   The intention of the bill is to make companies, Government departments and individuals think more carefully about the potential environmental consequences of their actions, use ecological surveys, deployed environmental safe guards and work with and around the natural world for fear of criminal charges.  It is not our intention to punish people, it is our intention to stop environmental damage.  It is worth noting that the bill allows the courts to decide to charge for restoration or use other restorative justice measures instead of prison time.

This is not a novel concept, road traffic offences, existing pollution offences and offences related to sale of dangerous food stuffs have strict liability. The reason for using strict liability in offences like pollution and ecocide is that doing away with the requirement of mens rea encourages increased vigilance in an area of public safety and combats the low level of prosecution of corporate crime (see Gammon (Hong Kong) Ltd. v Attorney General (1984)).   In both of the examples you gave (Chernobyl and BP oil spill) there was a very clear element of systematic negligence, a strict liability criminal law would certainly have made the executive take extra steps to ensure the disasters did not happen - that is the point of the bill.   who is to be tried?

Mass murder is a crime, but it is a crime against humans not humanity. Crimes against humanity must be so repulsive that they usurp what it means to be human.   If you believe that ecocide is a crime against humanity, you have to make the case that it is so horrible that it degrades the rest of the human race. My personal view is that this is unjustifiable on two points. One, crimes against humanity are too serious and too important to be left to domestic courts. If one is to declare something a crime against humanity, one can only do it with the support of a large portion of humanity itself. Two, it is my view that some of the extreme examples of ecocide are crimes against humanity, but those cases can be covered by existing provisions in international law.

Cutting down those hundred trees would have to lead to the loss or risk of loss of multiple human lives to be a crime against humanity.   This isn't true. Cutting down 100 trees would be classed as Ecocide if it decimated an entire ecosystem, as I said earlier on, as per this definition;   Ecocide is massive damage to, or destruction of, the entire ecosystem of a given territory by human(s) that causes, or risks, massive loss of life in and /or beyond that ecosystem.   Also, as per Section 2, Subsetion 2;   (2) Ecocide and humanity. A person, company, organisation, partnership, or any other legal entity who causes ecocide under section 1 of this Act and has breached a collective human right to life is also guilty of a crime against humanity.

Ecocide is an awful and almost always completely avoidable thing, and I am convinced that existing provisions do not protect the environment enough from such acts.   I do, however, have some queries.   Firstly, I am not sure strict liability is a good thing. I'm not a fan of strict liability at any time, and in a bill whose provisions necessarily require so much interpretation (e.g. In defining ""massive"") I do not think it wise not to allow the possibility of accidental or unknowing ecocide, however unlikely the government think it is.   Secondly, because this bill requires so much interpretation, I have to ask just how wide ranging the government expects this bill to be. For instance, in the past many parts of the UK had marshes drained to allow for human habitation or other development. Would this qualify as ecocide? What I'm getting at is the idea that there may be occasions where ecocide is accepted as part of some kind of risk assessment, perhaps where the developer agrees to relocate species or provide some other oasis."
MHOC,3d562k,NoPyroNoParty,3,Tue Jul 14 07:28:43 2015 UTC,"I commend the author for making a stand against ecocide, but this bill is not something I can support. Some of it is quite vague and can easily be taken out of context by keen lawyers.   Ecocide is massive damage to, or destruction of, the entire ecosystem of a given territory by human(s) that causes, or risks, massive loss of life in and /or beyond that ecosystem.   You use the word 'entire.' That means absolutely everything. Could you not then theoretically say if someone caused a forest fire, killed huge swathes of animals, insects and flora, yet left one single species of ant alive, would that not mean that the ecosystem hasn't been 'entirely' destroyed?   indigenous communities   Could the Honourable member inform me of the indigenous communities in Britain?    Any director, partner, leader and or any other person in a position of superior responsibility is responsible for offences committed by members of staff under his authority, and is responsible as a result of his authority over such staff, where he fails to take all necessary measures within his power to prevent or to stop all steps that lead to the commission of the crime of ecocide.   So let me give you an example. A logging company is cutting down trees in the Amazon. One logger lights a cigarette and throws it into a pile of leaves. The leaves catch fire and a forest fire is started. Why should the company be liable for the actions of this individual logger? If I murder someone at work, I am charged for the crime. Not my boss.   (2) Any member of government, prime minister or minister in a position of superior responsibility is responsible for offences committed by members of staff under his authority, and is responsible as a result of his authority over such staff, where he fails to take all necessary measures within his power to prevent or to stop all steps that lead to the commission of the crime of ecocide.   What? No. Bombing could easily result in ecocide. That would mean that the Prime Minister could be charged with ecocide should they ever bomb a forested area in a war. This part should be removed in its entirety. Keep the charge to the individuals unless it has been found that the company/organisation as a whole has been aiding those in committing ecocide."

Ugh, Rights. But on a more reasonable note, perhaps, if one person dies because things got a bit polluted is that then a crime against humanity? I certainly wouldn't say so.

Where the right to cultural life by indigenous communities has been severely diminished by the acts of a person, company, organisation, partnership, or any other legal entity that causes or fails to prevent extensive damage to, destruction of or loss of cultural life of the inhabitants of a territory under sections 1 – 4 of this Act is guilty of the crime of cultural ecocide.

If you can think of another term I would be greatful. Also, what about non-indigenous communities? If, for example, the british pumped a load of sewage into south africa, would it only be the black populace that are the victims of ""Cultural Ecocide"".

MHOC,3d20ej,GhoulishBulld0g,2,Sun Jul 12 23:56:08 2015 UTC,"This generally looks good :) However,  Regarding the UEFA Europa League, it would be preferable if it was stated that matches involving Home Nations teams only would be televised, given that with the current wording broadcasters are required to provide highlights of such footballing delights as Seinäjoen Jalkapallokerho vs Fimleikafélag Hafnarfjarðar from the first qualifying round on the previous two Thursdays so long as British sides remained in the tournament. On a similar note, the UEFA Champions League highlights should be clarified to include all matches with the possible exclusion of the live final but also the earliest qualifying rounds which are likely to attract only a niche audience at best. The Third Qualifying Round onwards would in my view be reasonable, but the Second Qualifying Round, Playoff Round or Group Stage would also prove appropriate. This should however be counterbalanced with a requirement to broadcast highlights from matches involving home nations sides even if they enter at an earlier round if at all possible (an exception would be needed due to the lack of appropriate broadcasting facilities at some of the earlier away ties). In addition, the Bill should define ""Home Nation"" - I take it this is a reference to England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland?  It may also be worthwhile to definite ""highlights"", simply to avoid a situation where only extremely limited coverage is made available with more extensive highlights requiring a subscription service.  Furtheremore, I would question regarding the cricket whether it is necessary for Scotland and Norther Ireland to be subjected to highlights from England's cricket tests.  Finally, I do believe there is currently somewhat of a loophole that renders this bill almost entirely meaningless at current. A station which operates on the Freeview network could at present simply encrypt the coverage and offer it on Freeview only to those who pay whilst also providing coverage on their premium, subscription-based channels. I believe a new clause is needed that would ban the implementation of these kinds of paywalls."

Frankly, I have serious doubts about anyone calling themselves a fan of football if they're not going to watch that match!  That said, when the qualifying criterion is:   UEFA Europa League (if home nations teams are participating)   It's hard to see how you could claim a home nation team to be participating in that match, given that both teams are foreign.   the Bill should define ""Home Nation"" - I take it this is a reference to England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland   I don't think there can be any confusion there; the term is commonly used to refer to the UK's constituent nations, and does not appear to be used to refer to anywhere else that I can see either (it is of course a fairly rare, though not unique, setup to have a country composed of other countries)."
MHOC,3d20ej,ieya404,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:16:29 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't claim that. However, since under Schedule B the UEFA Champions League is referred to and it is assumed this means all matches, it could reasonably be inferred that this phrasing therefore means ALL UEFA Europa League matches for so long as a home nations side is participating in the tournament, rather than in the match in question.  I was thinking that it could possibly be argued that it may include the Republic of Ireland, given in particular that for a number of the sports covered they compete in a shared team with Northern Ireland."

Firstly due to popular parliamentary opinion the Paralympic and Invictus games have been upgraded from a category B event to an category A event, enhancing this new list message of inclusiveness and equality.  Secondly, MotoGP has been given the same status as Formula One, due to requests from MPs. This means that the MotoGP British Grand Prix is now a category A event and that all other MotoGP races are a category B event.  Thirdly, after Welsh MPs explained that Wales does not have its own Cricket team, the same category A cricket matches on England's list have also been made available in Wales, however I strongly believe that Wales should have its own cricket team and that Glamorgan should not be playing in the county championship.  Finally, pro12 final matches have been removed from Northern Ireland', Wales's and Scotland's category A list, as the English premiership final was not included on England's list.  /u/mg9500"

I should think that is a matter for the ECB, Glamorgan and Wales in general.  Wales has been a key part of the England cricket team, but I suspect that on its own Wales would not be particularly competitive  (less so than Scotland and certainly less so than Ireland).   Plus there is the historical link between Glamorgan and the county championship... Glamorgan CCC has existed since 1888 and has always played with the English counties.

This isn't beef with the bill itself, I just take issue with the ideas stated here on Welsh cricket and Glamorgan CCC."

MHOC,3d20ej,InspGold,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:31:20 2015 UTC,"Mr Speaker, I raise concerns with the fact that all Category A events must be shown in full on television. Such a demand is practical for things such as the World Cup final where there is only one event however for events such as the Wimbledon Championships this just is not feasible with so many games being played at the one time especially at the beginning. I propose that it is allowed for coverage for such events be allowed to be split between television and internet coverage such is already seen by the BBC coverage."

MHOC,3d174a,Timanfya,5,Sun Jul 12 17:52:23 2015 UTC,I'm glad to see a 2nd reading that makes successful changes based on the debate from the first reading.

This should be ""that does not conform to the definitions of Part I, Section 1 or Section 2. "" This is a small change, if there are no other objections it should be changed prior to going to vote.

MHOC,3d174a,MrEugeneKrabs,3,Tue Jul 14 01:12:11 2015 UTC,An excellent bill that brings choice and information to the consumer
MHOC,3d174a,sZjLsFtA,5,Sun Jul 12 20:32:54 2015 UTC,"I am disheartened, as I was told you would explicate the implications of this in regards to imported produce. Since your party introduced a bill to, and the house voted to, ban all production of Kosher meat in our country I would have hoped we would have had more clarity into how this would be dealt with. Will the producer in x country have to also be verified by our country as well? If there is a dispute, how will those responsible be able to verify it's legitimacy? It seems like a very bureaucratically complex process. Rabbi's from London Beth Din for example would have to fly over. In the meanwhile, the continued attack on Kosher only drives prices up further. The extra bureaucratic hoops that organisations may have to jump through will ultimately hit the consumer, it's already impossible for those who keep Kosher to buy local produce, this will make it imported and more expensive.   This brings me to a wider point that has bothered me in regards to our houses attitude to animal welfare. When the bill was passed to outlaw the preparation of food in accordance with Jewish law I was told that this was a step towards a more ethical approach to animals. And that secular slaughterhouses - of whose practice I believe to be more barbaric and cruel (though bare in mind what I view as Kosher in terms of meat is more strict than most) - would be also more strictly regulated. I have yet to see a parity. We however continue to strangle the wallets of people of faith, driving the poorest into either conflict with their religion or to radically alter their diet. Ultimately it would seem I am asking for everyone to feel the same blow. To feel the same anxiety as their food bills eat more and more into their money. It's a worldly and personal benefit to eat less meat of course, but our house has succeeded in forcing Jewish and to a lesser extent Muslim people to a financial strain in the name of animal rights and compassion, whilst continuing to safeguard the wallets of other faiths and of secular people. Is the keeping of animals in tiny cages, malforming their bodies and feeding them unnatural food more ethical? Is the fact that they are 'kindly' stunned after months of vile conditions somehow so much better that it is exempt from our ridicule?   I will be voting nay on this bill. It will pass, and perhaps it should. People deserve to make a choice in what they eat. Perhaps we should acknowledge that boosting prices on certain foods damages that freedom of choice too."
MHOC,3d174a,AlbertDock,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:54:08 2015 UTC,We already have international agreements for certifying food. I see no reason why similar systems could not be used. There is no need for rabbis to be flying back and forth.  They could have appointed agents who could perform checks in other countries on their behalf.

I have added the ability for certifiers to apply to the Secretary of State for official status on the symbol, in line with the suggestions due to the multiple different interpretations, I have also changed the fine, so it now applies to the retailer instead of the producer.   /u/Duncs11"

Consumers have a right to know how their meat has been slaughtered and if it has been done in a religious context. Other than the small change that /u/AlbertDock mentioned I feel that this bill is perfect.  I will be voting Aye to this bill.

This is usually done by first asking for a reconsideration, then asking the ombudsman to look at the case and where appropriate asking for a judicial review. I am sure /u/Duncs11 will tell me if he has any different thoughts on the subject."

A vote for you to become speaker is a vote to abolish the idea of a speaker.  Even before you outlined your ridiculous plan I hated the idea of you becoming a speaker.

Great minds and all that.  It was a concern, for a while, that we would struggle to find a competent candidate speaker (we do now have a few of course) and my only thought was why do we even need a speaker? The idea that have a member at the very top that makes the final call on decisions and oversees everything is redundant now that those powers have been moved to the Head Moderator. This just means that the new speaker will just be a deputy speaker that has to give up their party affiliation (and probably any enjoyment they get out of mhoc) in exchange for a fancy title.  This isn't some anarchist plot to overthrow the speakership, it's a legitimate concern shared by a number of people that have experienced the situation. All speakership entails now is organising day-to-day meta stuff like posting bills and so on, and it has clearly been proven that trusted members are capable of doing that fairly while retaining their party affiliation.  I know you'll think any society can't possibly live without an all-powerful leader but you have that - they are the Head Mod, and if there is anything that can't be decided otherwise - I can't even see that happening - they make any important decisions. I mean there have been a number of times in the past where Ben has gone on holiday and left one of us as Acting Speaker and it's always quickly realised that we can work fine without a Speaker (we love you really Ben). Call it a committee or whatever you like, but this place being overseen by a Head Mod and a group of we see of now as Deputy Speakers could be run just as well, if not better."

To be blunt, and not to put down the stellar job which Ben has already done, we have already seen this - the CWL and the permanent seat deficit (but completely illogical refusal to do anything about it), a complete lack of transparency in the constitutional committee, and the frankly baffling attempt to introduce FPTP for important and necessary adminship positions, coupled with shut ears to the vast majority of the community who rallied against it. There are also massive discrepancies based on personal opinion, rather than what the community actually wants: for example, while Ben wants a limit on the number of parties allowed to form, Rory does not. I personally think it far more important that the community be allowed to decide for themselves, considering that we're all in this to have fun.  And nevermind all the problems associated with the person holding the position i've already outlined, there are massive problems with the position itself. Ben could very well have just gone 'fuck it' and left MHOC, leaving us holding the bag. You know as well as I do that the deputy speakers currently have little authority beyond putting up bills and dealing with trivial matters, and that if we didn't have leading direction, the entire thing would fall apart as soon as something we're unsure of how to deal with appeared (as it did with the Geo vote changing in the trident motion, since he was on holiday!). Replacing it with committees, or multiple senior admins, or pretty much anything more democratic than the current system, would massively increase stability, and massively decrease the chance of the community falling apart. The exact system we would use would depend on which proposals the community agrees with the most."
MHOC,3d0m2w,RoryTime,4,Sun Jul 12 17:21:57 2015 UTC,"The entire simulation currently revolves around the whims and beliefs of whoever is holding the administration position, rather than what the actual best approach is.   Do the existence of Deputy Speakers as well as a Constitution and a VONC mechanism not already ensure that the Speaker does what's best for the community?   CWL   S A L T. In all seriousness though Ben's justification for why the decision he made regarding them was fair enough in my opinion.   the frankly baffling attempt to introduce FPTP for important and necessary adminship positions, coupled with shut ears to the vast majority of the community who rallied against it.   Yeah this wasn't a great idea tbf but do you think something like that would happen again now that we've seen what happened then?   I personally think it far more important that the community be allowed to decide for themselves, considering that we're all in this to have fun.   Yeah I agree with this but would it not be better for people to put their views to the Speaker than if we did something like voting on every single little thing?   You know as well as I do that the deputy speakers currently have little authority beyond putting up bills and dealing with trivial matters, and that if we didn't have leading direction, the entire thing would fall apart as soon as something we're unsure of how to deal with appeared (as it did with the Geo vote changing in the trident motion, since he was on holiday!).   How is this not an argument in favour of keeping the Speakership role?    Replacing it with committees, or multiple senior admins, or pretty much anything more democratic than the current system, would massively increase stability, and massively decrease the chance of the community falling apart.   How would you ensure that this doesn't make decision making slower and more partisan?"
MHOC,3d0m2w,Sephronar,3,Sun Jul 12 17:45:01 2015 UTC,Hear hear.
MHOC,3d0m2w,Spudgunn,2,Sun Jul 12 17:22:09 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I understand your phrasing - though if you're talking about cross-party support; I believe my legislative record shows how I can have support from all corners of the house.
MHOC,3d0m2w,Sephronar,7,Sun Jul 12 15:01:41 2015 UTC,Your legislative record shows you come up with an array of completely stupid joke legislation.
MHOC,3d0m2w,ThatThingInTheCorner,3,Sun Jul 12 15:28:41 2015 UTC,well that's not a very nice thing to say :( I'm just trying to make this country a better place ok
MHOC,3d0m2w,RoryTime,6,Sun Jul 12 15:44:23 2015 UTC,What will you do to ensure that MHOC continues to grow?
MHOC,3d0m2w,Djenial,4,Sun Jul 12 15:11:08 2015 UTC,I'll continue with what I've done with Ben for the past 10 months as Deputy Speaker. However to be more specific I'll try to ensure that we can extend the sidebar ad as well as trying to advertise on larger subs (with permission) and trying to raise some media/politico interest so that we reach more people.
MHOC,3d0m2w,RoryTime,3,Sun Jul 12 15:28:38 2015 UTC,"I'll continue with what I've done with Ben for the past 10 months as Deputy Speaker.   What is it that you have been doing, separate to including adverts on other subs and so on?  EDIT: Missing word"
MHOC,3d0m2w,Djenial,3,Sun Jul 12 15:32:08 2015 UTC,"Well, I accidentally left some MHoC stuff in Central Lobby of Westminster :p  Seriously though, I have helped out by ensuring that the MHoC is a welcoming place as well as a steady, functioning and most importantly of all, an interesting one. I have also been trying (with some success) to convert MHoCers from the other place."
MHOC,3d0m2w,RoryTime,3,Sun Jul 12 15:37:50 2015 UTC,"Well, I accidentally left some MHoC stuff in Central Lobby of Westminster   How did you manage that? :P"
MHOC,3d0m2w,Djenial,3,Sun Jul 12 15:42:14 2015 UTC,"Work experience, I went up to see PMQs but left some of my sheets by Lloyd George, and then since the disability protestors tried to barge into it, the Lobby was shut off for a bit and I didn't have time to get them before my next engagement."
MHOC,3d0m2w,RoryTime,2,Sun Jul 12 15:47:44 2015 UTC,"Haha, you were there when the disability protesters were there? I tried to get work experience during our week but wasn't accepted -.-"
MHOC,3d0m2w,Djenial,3,Sun Jul 12 15:51:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was, it was pretty hectic! How did you apply, if you don't mind me asking?"
MHOC,3d0m2w,RoryTime,2,Sun Jul 12 15:56:02 2015 UTC,"Through the House of Commons applications process, they treat like an actual job, and the application was reasonably lengthy."
MHOC,3d0m2w,Djenial,3,Sun Jul 12 17:13:18 2015 UTC,"Ahh, try contacting local MPs, they're usually fairly nice and will take people."
MHOC,3d0m2w,Jas1066,3,Sun Jul 12 17:21:10 2015 UTC,"Reach out further to other subs, make neutral adverts on large subs with their permission. With some research, we could maybe branch out further than reddit although I'm not entirely sure whether that would be a good thing yet."
MHOC,3d0m2w,wwesmudge,3,Sun Jul 12 15:15:27 2015 UTC,"As I have said previously, I think that we need more interaction with other model communities, which I hope will allow them to expand."
MHOC,3d0m2w,Cocktorpedo,3,Sun Jul 12 15:17:44 2015 UTC,Keep showcasing this fantastic sub to communities of passionate political men and women both on Reddit and beyond.
MHOC,3d0m2w,Sephronar,3,Sun Jul 12 16:16:36 2015 UTC,I would continue the actions of my predecessor.
MHOC,3d0m2w,NoPyroNoParty,2,Sun Jul 12 17:04:21 2015 UTC,"As I said below, my hopes are to branch out across the internet - making sure we're not just seen by a few redditors who stumble across us; we need our own independent way of making sure we continue growth of MHoC."
MHOC,3d0m2w,RoryTime,4,Sun Jul 12 15:19:59 2015 UTC,"Rory, you've reeled off a whole list of ideas you have (most of which I don't agree with but we'll let that slide for now) but one thing always bugs me with these elections - you've been a deputy speaker for an awful long time now, why haven't you done any of this already? It's all great standing around now and saying all this great stuff you'd like to do but you've been here for many months and you could have done a lot of this long ago. What was holding you back?"
MHOC,3d0m2w,Spudgunn,3,Sun Jul 12 16:47:42 2015 UTC,"you've been a deputy speaker for an awful long time now, why haven't you done any of this already?   Because I'm not going to list things that I've already done in an election about the future of the MHoC. Furthermore lots of the ideas above have only developed because of earlier ideas being put into practice. For example the Electoral Roll wouldn't have been needed without the MW, there would be no point aiming for realism by introducing committees with the much more glaring commission of the HoL etc. Most of the ideas above are ones that have been developed relatively recently.  There's also the fact that I do not have unlimited time, so I have not been able to implement everything the same day as conception."
MHOC,3d0m2w,Djenial,2,Sun Jul 12 16:59:11 2015 UTC,"If I said in a debate that transgender people are just insane and shouldn't exist, what would happen to me under your speakership?"
MHOC,3d0m2w,Sephronar,3,Sun Jul 12 17:09:39 2015 UTC,"Although I think the rest of the house would rip you to shreds, you are entitled to say that. Unparliamentary language does not mean outlandish opinions."
MHOC,3d0m2w,Spudgunn,2,Sun Jul 12 17:36:26 2015 UTC,"You're allowed your free speech, but that must concur with parliamentary language."
MHOC,3d0m2w,Sephronar,2,Sun Jul 12 17:11:39 2015 UTC,"but that must concur with parliamentary language.   What does this mean within the context of my question? Is expressing the controversial opinion unparliamentary, or are you referring to, for example, putting swear words in the expression of that opinion (which would be unparliamentary in any context.)"
MHOC,3d0m2w,Spudgunn,3,Sun Jul 12 17:15:22 2015 UTC,"So long as, you don't break the list of parliamentary words, then you should be allowed to say what you like."
MHOC,3d0m2w,Sephronar,5,Sun Jul 12 17:29:20 2015 UTC,"Where's the list of unparliamentary words, and how is it decided what it consists of?"
MHOC,3d0m2w,Spudgunn,4,Sun Jul 12 17:30:56 2015 UTC,"United Kingdom  In House of Commons of the United Kingdom, the following words have been deemed unparliamentary over time:   blackguard coward git guttersnipe hooligan hypocrite idiot ignoramus liar pipsqueak rat swine stoolpigeon tart traitor sod slimy wart As well as accusations of 'crooked deals' or insinuation of the use of banned substances by a member are also considered unparliamentary language (all attributable to Dennis Skinner)."
MHOC,3d0m2w,Zephyroo,3,Sun Jul 12 17:38:32 2015 UTC,So you want to use the real one... I see.
MHOC,3d0m2w,Spudgunn,2,Sun Jul 12 18:54:08 2015 UTC,The First Amendment <3
MHOC,3d0m2w,wwesmudge,3,Sun Jul 12 17:14:54 2015 UTC,"To all candidates - in terms of the electoral system used in /r/MHOC, do you favour proportionality or something resembling the real life system?  I'll get you to answer this on a scale of 1-10, actually. 1 being a fully proportional system, and 10 being full first past the post as in real life."
MHOC,3d0m2w,RoryTime,3,Sun Jul 12 17:19:36 2015 UTC,5
MHOC,3d0m2w,Spudgunn,3,Sun Jul 12 17:25:50 2015 UTC,"4 - I like constituencies, and I also like the wide variety of debate. I favour the status quo at the moment, which has both constituencies and and full proportionality, so it's the best of both worlds."
MHOC,3d0m2w,Cocktorpedo,4,Sun Jul 12 17:31:33 2015 UTC,How can you possibly have the idea of constituencies at all in an internet simulation of democracy?
MHOC,3d0m2w,Rlack,2,Sun Jul 12 17:32:48 2015 UTC,"Probably 2ish. The smaller parties (such as your own) benefit more from a more proportional system, and I feel a variety of views makes the debate and vote more interesting - I certainly don't want a carbon copy of real life, with the same big parties repeating each other ad nauseum. However, there is something to say for the constituency system, which I feel adds a certain something to the 'realism' - voting for a national constituency isn't really the same."
MHOC,3d0m2w,HaveADream,4,Sun Jul 12 17:27:18 2015 UTC,"In /u/Timanfya's resignation, he mentioned the sheer time and devotion that being the Speaker requires, absorbing almost all of his free time and sometimes even making him regret creating /r/MHoC.  Do you believe that you have that devotion & attention to detail that /r/MHoC has enjoyed under /u/Timanfya?"
MHOC,3d0m2w,RoryTime,3,Sun Jul 12 19:09:54 2015 UTC,"What will you do to combat electoral fraud, without severely limiting the amount of people that vote during the General Election?"
MHOC,3d0m2w,Djenial,3,Sun Jul 12 14:42:59 2015 UTC,"Firstly an electoral roll that not only works internationally but one that goes down to a constituency level would prevent parties consolidating their voters into just a few constituencies. Secondly preventing parties from advertising where they run - and enforcing that rule should be done (however an electoral roll will also reduce the effect of people breaking the rule). Moreover if the Speaker does more neutral advertising then only running in a few constituencies may start to be worse than running in all (therefore getting more potential voters).  However both of these are trying to address the symptoms, not the root cause of the problem - parties not having enough candidates to run everywhere and a lack of confidence in our current proportional system. Now the first cause (not having enough candidates) will be partially negated by creating the Lords instead of expanding the House - this means that there will be a higher candidate:seat ratio, enabling more parties to run nationwide. With the second, perhaps a few more national seats may be in order after the next expansion, bringing it closer to one in four than one in five.  With regards to advertising on external sites without permission, people have generally been respectful and not done that - however if elected I will continue to run regular checks across websites/google in the GE to prevent that happening."
MHOC,3d0m2w,tyroncs,3,Sun Jul 12 14:55:51 2015 UTC,"I really don't like the electoral role system, it discourages people from getting involved in the model world and will impact the most on the smallest model parliaments. Zoning down as far as constituencies is going to make zones full of a certain party, as parties will choose to make areas with heavy support."
MHOC,3d0m2w,HaveADream,3,Sun Jul 12 15:04:02 2015 UTC,"Hear, Hear"
MHOC,3d0m2w,RoryTime,3,Sun Jul 12 17:26:34 2015 UTC,So how will non-regular MHOC members vote if they're not on the electoral roll?
MHOC,3d0m2w,HaveADream,7,Sun Jul 12 14:57:07 2015 UTC,First time voters are auto-enrolled wherever they vote.
MHOC,3d0m2w,RoryTime,2,Sun Jul 12 15:09:19 2015 UTC,Thanks for your answers.
MHOC,3d0m2w,tyroncs,4,Sun Jul 12 15:19:13 2015 UTC,No problem.
MHOC,3d0m2w,RoryTime,3,Sun Jul 12 15:39:39 2015 UTC,"Going on a tangent here I guess, but lots of the smaller Model Houses are near dead. Whilst it is annoying, allowing people from the /r/MHOC to participate there and vice versa allows extra activity on both subreddits. For example is someone was told to either commit to the large very active subreddit that it isn't their native Parliament, or a stagnant smaller one - that is a hard choice to make.  The real issue is uninformed voters not native to the country, and the simple solution to that is to enforce the not telling people where to vote plan, whilst also clearly having an 'international region' for people not native to the country, which is capped at a certain % of the overall MP count"

For example is someone was told to either commit to the large very active subreddit that it isn't their native Parliament, or a stagnant smaller one - that is a hard choice to make.   I agree, which is why the MW team have transferred to a policy of only inviting/accepting large, mature model countries with little crossover. In addition we're working more with countries outside the official MW.   The real issue is uninformed voters not native to the country, and the simple solution to that is to enforce the not telling people where to vote plan, whilst also clearly having an 'international region' for people not native to the country, which is capped at a certain % of the overall MP count   But the problem here is groups telling groups from other places how to vote, they'd just specify not to vote in the international region."
MHOC,3d0m2w,Jas1066,5,Sun Jul 12 17:40:02 2015 UTC,"I think firstly we need to look at exactly who gets the right to vote and how that differs for each election we hold (general, by-election, amendments etc.) and also how we can verify those votes. A simple system of having each vote verified by a comment on a thread may seem tedious, but it's a good safeguard."
MHOC,3d0m2w,Sephronar,3,Sun Jul 12 16:13:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think anything else needs doing. As far as I am aware, we don't have a significant problem in this aspect of the simulation, so all I can say if that I will listen to what I am told, especially from the Head Moderator."
MHOC,3d0m2w,RoryTime,2,Sun Jul 12 15:04:30 2015 UTC,Improved validation systems - checking all IPs through the ballot - making sure everyone only votes once; and making sure those votes are through means that are purely fair for all parties involved.
MHOC,3d0m2w,Sephronar,5,Sun Jul 12 14:45:17 2015 UTC,How would you check everyone's IP? Google forms doesn't allow it and survey monkey would cost upwards of £300 per year.
MHOC,3d0m2w,RoryTime,2,Sun Jul 12 14:58:40 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain Survey Monkey has a built in IP-check feature, as I'm sure I saw when I used it before."
MHOC,3d0m2w,Sephronar,3,Sun Jul 12 15:06:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, however that only works up to 100 responses (per month) and after that you can't see any responses."
MHOC,3d0m2w,GhoulishBulld0g,2,Sun Jul 12 15:09:09 2015 UTC,Well in that case I think the cost of 300 pounds is a good investment - and something I as speaker would pay for to ensure security in GEs.

MHOC,3d0m2w,Djenial,3,Sun Jul 12 17:58:27 2015 UTC,"It does, but only for the first 100 people to answer the form, unless you pay for more."
MHOC,3d0m2w,HaveADream,2,Sun Jul 12 15:10:12 2015 UTC,"There's no absolute way to ensure people don't try to defraud the system, but running elections where IPs can be checked and locking at unknown accounts for regular activity are good things we can do."
MHOC,3d0m2w,Djenial,3,Sun Jul 12 14:49:50 2015 UTC,"I meant more with advertising on certain sites, like 4chan or Facebook groups with more than 10k followers, or telling people to vote in one area."
MHOC,3d0m2w,Jas1066,2,Sun Jul 12 14:56:15 2015 UTC,"Well there's no real solution to that I'm afraid, it's a shame people can't just respect the rules and enjoy the game, for that's what this is. For some sites, it may work if we talk to the moderators of these places that are commonly used to make them aware of the problem."

MHOC,3d0m2w,Djenial,3,Sun Jul 12 17:43:10 2015 UTC,"Well I don't personally want to make much change as MHoC is very stable and fun to play - however if I had to choose anything; I would improve the experience for members who arent on Skype, having more events such as reddit live. And I would also like to de-centralise things off of Reddit - branching out across the internet."
MHOC,3d0m2w,JackWilfred,3,Sun Jul 12 17:51:46 2015 UTC,"My questions are to /u/Cocktorpedo specifically.  Why is more democracy better?  You've been talking about making MHoC sustainable, most of this stems from the idea that if the speaker were to vanish, there's no clear delegation of powers so the deputies have no real power. Surely the solution is simply to further empower the deputies rather than a complete overhall of the system. Why is this radical overhaul neccessary?"
MHOC,3d0m2w,Totallynotapanda,3,Sun Jul 12 18:44:59 2015 UTC,"How do you plan on increasing the retention rate of new members? It seems to me that although we have had large influxes of new members, the leadership and most active members of most parties have been here since the beginning"
MHOC,3d0m2w,HaveADream,5,Sun Jul 12 19:28:28 2015 UTC,"I shall be officially endorsing /u/RoryTime to become the next Speaker.  I've worked with him extensively over the past 10 months and when I reached out to him on TSR I did so because I thought that one day he could take over from me. I trust him completely and his attitude and devotion towards the MHoC is the best.  I will work with him closely, should he be elected, so you can sure of stability and neutrality.  I would also like to suggest that some of the candidates who haven't had deputy speakership experience contact the next Speaker (if they themselves do not win) and ask about becoming one.   So in short: Rory for Speaker!"
MHOC,3d0m2w,NoPyroNoParty,5,Sun Jul 12 18:21:16 2015 UTC,"Surprise = No  The electoral role I feel would also be detrimental, and removing the 10 member limit for members to form a party would be madness. Also, I do believe we were supposed to be banned from endorsing people after the green leadership elections, but for Speaker it's fine?"
MHOC,3d0m2w,Duncs11,4,Sun Jul 12 18:24:36 2015 UTC,"Head Moderator, I must protest.  Although I recognise that you have a right in ways to express an opinion on this election, you must realise that your view holds a lot of weight in the MHoC community, and you are tallying and counting the votes in this election.  Therefore I, and other members of this House, expected you to remain neutral and professional during the Speakership campaign. And to top it off, you have also baselessly attacked another candidate's platform on top of that."
MHOC,3d0m2w,banter_lad_m8,3,Sun Jul 12 18:41:20 2015 UTC,"Hear, hear!  Secondly, I believe it is entirely adequate that /u/Timanfya gave his opinion on who should take his place. He is the one with the most knowledge of how /r/MHOC works and his opinion is highly valued.   Neutrality is all well and good, but when the future of the sub is in the balance I believe it is an unnecessary formality.   /u/Timanfya knows each of the candidates and has come to the conclusion that /u/RoryTime is the best suited. His opinion deserves to be shared. He has spent a year of his life on this project and his opinion doesn't deserve to be cast aside because it isn't 'impartial.'"

MHOC,3d0m2w,AlbertDock,3,Sun Jul 12 18:30:25 2015 UTC,"Are we doing this then? I think /u/cocktorpedo's changes are the only thing that can take MHoC forward and I've actually given reasons for it rather than instinctively resisting change. He's said it all very well in reply to your good self already but after all it will hardly be any different to how it is now - you will have most of the same powers as head mod now and the speaker just gets left with all the worst bits of what is already a horrible job, when it can be run collectively (as 99% of it already is) with the head mod still at the top overseeing things in case people are really not able to cope with the idea of not having omnipotent leader.  Endorsement time now though: if we're actually going to have a speaker then my full backing is behind /u/Djenial. A nice, level-headed and unpartisan guy that has the right ideas to maintain an enjoyable experience for all."

MHOC,3d0m2w,RoryTime,3,Sun Jul 12 15:17:13 2015 UTC,"In theory just a parliament with 15 seats (most of which always vote). However we've made the policy change of only inviting/accepting bigger ones and also doing more things with non-MW Govs.  The /r/ModelUSGov is a current member of the MW and by far the larger of the two, it would take a substantial change in circumstances for /r/MUSGov to be recognised as a MW sub (although I am happy to work with them unofficially)."
MHOC,3d0m2w,Jas1066,2,Sun Jul 12 15:23:01 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen a model parliament start with any less seats than 15, so does that include all of them (if they are active)?"

MHOC,3czzr2,NoPyroNoParty,5,Sun Jul 12 09:12:31 2015 UTC,"The rate of Value Added Tax on all helium leisure related products is to be increased to 50%, this includes but is not limited to leisure/party balloons and canisters of helium designed for leisure use.   Well, I suppose that's certainly one way of ensuring that all helium canisters lose any form of fancy branding and are simply labelled ""Helium"".   The minimum price for the sale of helium gas is £60 per cubic metre at normal temperature and pressure,  The minimum price for the sale liquid helium is £7 per litre at normal temperature and pressure,   Firstly, it might be simpler to use the same measure of volume for consistency - helium gas is 6p per litre using the above.  More interestingly, could the Government perhaps share the secrets of how helium can be present as a liquid at normal temperature and pressures, since traditionally it's not been possible to liquefy it above -267.7°C.  This is a scientific breakthrough quite possibly worthy of a Nobel prize.  May I also ask, what incentive helium companies will have to sell 100% Helium to schools, hospitals, and universities, when they can charge considerably more (the minimum price) for 65% Helium for leisure purposes, which will be far more profitable?  This does not feel as though it's been thought through properly..."
MHOC,3czzr2,ieya404,2,Sun Jul 12 10:52:39 2015 UTC,"The normal temperature and pressure is meant for liquid helium, which is 1 atmosphere of pressure at -269°C. That is not made clear, and shall be if there is another reading.   which will be far more profitable?   How exactly will it be more profitable, at 65% helium they will be paying for less helium than at 100%, so the price will go up because there is more helium in 100% than 65%."
MHOC,3czzr2,Djenial,2,Sun Jul 12 11:06:53 2015 UTC,"Right, let's assume that I have 1m3 of pure helium to sell.  I can sell that to a school, university, or hospital, for ""under the minimum price"" - for the sake of argument, let's say £59.95 (very, very barely under the minimum price of £60, though I assume the intent of the bill is to allow those establishments to buy significantly more cheaply).  Or, I could add 0.54m3 of air (can we agree that's basically free of charge?) to my helium, so I now have 1.54m3 of 64.9% Helium mix (close enough to the maximum 65% permitted).  I can now sell 1.54m3 of helium to a leisure provider for £92.40 (at minimum price).  By padding out my helium with some free air, I've just made an extra £32.45 of pure profit.  Why would I ever want to sell the pure product?"
MHOC,3czzr2,ieya404,2,Sun Jul 12 11:30:20 2015 UTC,"The minimum price only takes into account the amount of helium in the container, not the entire product. I understand this also isn't clear, you've been very useful :)"
MHOC,3czzr2,Djenial,2,Sun Jul 12 11:45:17 2015 UTC,"Okay, so if you're selling 1m3 of 65%He, the minimum price for that is actually £39 (65% of £60) - I agree that this first draft is a little misleading in places!  Still, though - if I can sell 1m3 of He to a leisure provider for £60, or 1m3 of He to an educational/medical provider for less-than-£60 plus it needs to be purified to a higher standard so will cost me more to produce... what's the incentive?  If, as I suspect, the intent is to discourage leisure use of helium, then it might be more useful to look at some sort of mechanism where it actively costs a seller more to sell to a leisure provider (VAT isn't the answer, as that's paid by the buyer)?  Perhaps a surcharge which is linked to the percentage of sales that seller makes to leisure providers, to be levied on leisure sales only - which would both incentivise selling to educational/medical providers (as it gets your leisure sales percentage down), and also start ramping up the cost of leisure helium (given that non-leisure usage will likely have a natural limit, and so if leisure usage scaled up then the price to leisure users will scale up too)?"

MHOC,3czzr2,Djenial,5,Sun Jul 12 12:31:34 2015 UTC,"Opening Speech:  Mr Speaker, Honourable and Right Honourable Members of this House,  I bring forward a bill to help save a vital element, that is often overlooked by the populace and environmentalists alike. It is a common misconception that helium is the one of the most commonplace elements on Earth, it is not. Helium is one of the most common element in the universe, where we cannot get it. On Earth, helium is growing continually rarer, as its use in important industries grows and our appetite for helium balloons inflates to an unworkable level. That is the reason for this bill. With a reduction in the amount of helium being used unnecessarily and higher prices and taxes for helium products, it is hoped this bill will streamline the purchasing of helium so that it is used by the industries that are dependent on it, rather than making our voices squeaky. The medical, welding and magnet production, electronics, nuclear, and aerospace industry rely on helium, we frankly can’t do without it. This bill also introduces a scheme to help businesses and scientific organisations recycle their helium, so that we prolong the remains of this vital resource. This is not an issue we can leave much longer, and I hope you agree that actions needs to be taken now."
MHOC,3czzr2,Djenial,3,Sun Jul 12 10:56:39 2015 UTC,"Here is the bill in Google Format, for anyone who wants it. This bill is sponsored by: /u/AlbertDock, /u/regioisomer, /u/Zoto888, /u/Cocktorpedo"
MHOC,3czzr2,Djenial,3,Sun Jul 12 10:49:04 2015 UTC,"I fully support this bill - we are fast running out of helium (a vital and irreplaceable element used in research and medical imaging), and every measure should be undertaken to stop it being wasted - such as in balloons."

We live in a globalised world with constantly changing commodity markets, we can't even attempt to set a fixed minimum price.   The minimum price, plus VAT increase, will ultimately hurt those in lower incomes, who will be priced out of the markets where helium is required. Expect to see helium balloons become a luxury good only those on higher incomes can afford."
MHOC,3czzr2,demon4372,4,Sun Jul 12 10:26:18 2015 UTC,"This entire comment is ridiculous.   I am uncomfortable with the idea of setting minimum prices for things, governments will never be able to respond to global and domestic markets in a efficient enough fashion to change it.   Just like with climate change, we are shortly going to have a massive helium shortage. Frankly, I don't care about global and domestic markets of helium - if I were supreme dictator, I would personally ban all use of it except for in medical and research roles. THAT is how bad this problem is.    The minimum price, plus VAT increase, will ultimately hurt those in lower incomes, who will be priced out of the markets where helium is required   There are no markets where 'lower incomes' participate in helium, other than the helium balloon market, which is frivolous and wasteful.   Expect to see helium balloons become a luxury good only those on higher incomes can afford.   I don't care. In fact, this is a positive: fewer people wasting helium is much better for our cause."
MHOC,3czzr2,Cocktorpedo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:16:51 2015 UTC,"The minimum price is currently very close to what the current price of helium in the UK is, it serves to prevent people bulk buying huge amounts and getting discounts and from buying it from companies abroad very cheaply.  Could you tell me what the markets are where helium is required? I find it irritating that every tax rise is seen as something that will lock out every person on a lower income, when in reality it really won't."
MHOC,3czzr2,Djenial,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:43:00 2015 UTC,"The minimum price is currently very close to what the current price of helium in the UK is   Key word here being ""currently"". Currently sure. But world commodity markets are unpredictable, and there will inevitably be a point at which to international price will be considerably different to the UK min price.    I find it irritating that every tax rise is seen as something that will lock out every person on a lower income, when in reality it really won't.    When you raise sales taxes, and specifically  a sales tax on one particular item, and by so much. It will of course price Lower incomes out the market. So you think that with a sales tax double the standard rate, that people on lower incomes will be willing to spend even more ok helium reliant goods. It will make all sorts of items, including balloons, expensive to the point they become luxury items, so only higher incomes buy them. You are excluding lower incomes from, granted a pretty minor and non-essential thing, but you, the ""left wing"" government of all people shouldn't be the ones pricing lower incomes out."

Lots of businesses use helium products as advertising or similar, would this sort of thing be subject to the higher rate or not? One could then argue lots of ways that other balloons have a ""meaningful purpose"" or don't.  Also, companies that sell pre-inflated helium balloons will be paying double the high rate of tax, paying it on canisters and on the balloons themselves. What even is a ""canister designed for leisure use""? Could I not buy a canister, inflate one random thing with it and then use the rest to just inflate fun balloons?

The volume of helium produced will not match global demand by any means at all.   an unlimited source of energy.   It's not unlimited by any means, and it's still likely to be massively expensive and not commercially viable even after the test reactors have demonstrated efficacy."

Would the government also consider going to /r/RMUN to hammer out a wider-ranging deal on the production and use of helium? Its rarity does not affect only the UK, and indeed helium production occurs mostly in the US."
MHOC,3czzr2,bnzss,2,Mon Jul 13 09:16:53 2015 UTC,"Of course, I'd be delighted to, there is a reason the bill also requests the US cease their rapid sell off of reserves."
MHOC,3cx7rk,banter_lad_m8,9,Sat Jul 11 16:03:39 2015 UTC,"The Educational Secretary is aware I detest every single one of his policies and have never hid that, but I would like to ask him how on earth he combines his smaller class sizes idea with his crazy and appalling idea to shut down Private Schools, adding yet more strain to the State System, and yet more pupils to classes?"
MHOC,3cx7rk,Duncs11,3,Sat Jul 11 16:19:43 2015 UTC,"The Private School population makes up around 7% of the total school population and so added to the extra investment in Education that /u/zoto888 announced in the budget there would be no problem dealing with an increase in pupils, especially given that we have just passed legislation to give LEA's greater ability to build state schools when they need them."
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,11,Sat Jul 11 18:12:39 2015 UTC,"AS levels being scrapped for people starting them next year has widely been criticised, but you have done nothing to reverse the changes. Will you?"
MHOC,3cx7rk,tyroncs,7,Sat Jul 11 16:19:59 2015 UTC,"Hear, hear!"
MHOC,3cx7rk,RachelChamberlain,5,Sat Jul 11 16:20:36 2015 UTC,This has been dealt with in the Exam Reform bill.
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,6,Sat Jul 11 18:13:38 2015 UTC,"Not really,  You made it so they were at best 30% of the 2 year course. Considering they used to be 50%, that is barely an improvement at all.   Logically it doesn't work either, unless you only plan on teaching 70% of the course in the second year - which is plain evil"
MHOC,3cx7rk,tyroncs,2,Sat Jul 11 20:11:24 2015 UTC,"It's an appropriate compromise between the two situations. AS levels will count towards the final A level but the second year exam, that takes place after two years of learning, will be weighted more heavily."
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,5,Sat Jul 11 20:30:59 2015 UTC,"That is ridiculous though. Essentially you are saying that people can piss about in the first year and not try too hard, as ultimately that year means less then half than the following one. It also means that you are going to have to cram almost double the content in less time in Year 13, which is unfair to not only the students but the teachers as well"
MHOC,3cx7rk,tyroncs,2,Sat Jul 11 20:42:47 2015 UTC,"Hear, hear!"
MHOC,3cx7rk,RachelChamberlain,2,Sat Jul 11 20:51:23 2015 UTC,"We are not talking about students doing 70% of the course in the second year and 30% in  the first, we are proposing that the years be weighted in that way. That does not effect how much a student learns in each year or how many exams, or how long exams are in each year.   Put simply, the way in which marks are weighted has no effect on how much you actually learn in each year.  Take university for example. Typically 1st year counts for nothing, 2nd year counts for about 30% and the last year counts for the rest. But you normally do about the same amount of work in each year.   This is no different and if students decide to do no work in the first year then they will be at a disadvantage in the second it will show in the marks they get."
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,3,Sat Jul 11 21:06:20 2015 UTC,"That does not effect how much a student learns in each year or how many exams, or how long exams are in each year.   Oh come on yes it does. In universities like you mention the first year means nothing, but are you seriously suggesting that they learn 'just as much' in that year?  What you are telling students is 'the stuff in this year means next to nothing, so don't bother trying too much.' What reason do you have for not putting it back to 50%/50%, like it used to be?"
MHOC,3cx7rk,tyroncs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:35:09 2015 UTC,"The content of the first, second and third years are the same or near enough the same in terms of quantity. That is what I'm saying. How students respond to that is up to them, but those students who put in the most effort over all the years of there education will get the most out of it and that is how it should be."
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:12:03 2015 UTC,"The content of the first, second and third years are the same or near enough the same in terms of quantity.   Perhaps my university was different to others but this was not the case at all. My first year had significantly less work (less than A levels even) and the quality of teaching was far worse than the other two years."
MHOC,3cx7rk,Tim-Sanchez,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:49:57 2015 UTC,That would be because PHD students tend to take first year seminars. This doesn't apply to A Levels.
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,2,Sun Jul 12 01:26:30 2015 UTC,I have still failed to ascertain from the minister whether the A levels will be weighted 70/30 by content as well as in exams
MHOC,3cx7rk,Ajubbajub,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:39:50 2015 UTC,"Not content, it's just the weight given to the respective years. It does not mean that students do 70% of the work in the second year."
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,2,Sat Jul 11 22:13:42 2015 UTC,The train wreck of a bill.
MHOC,3cx7rk,Ajubbajub,3,Sat Jul 11 21:38:54 2015 UTC,Hear hear!
MHOC,3cx7rk,MorganC1,14,Sat Jul 11 18:10:46 2015 UTC,Has the right honourable member ever had to submit 8 pieces of coursework all in the same week?
MHOC,3cx7rk,wwesmudge,3,Sat Jul 11 16:11:13 2015 UTC,I've never produced legislation that would make such an event take place so you've wasted the first of two possible sarcastic remarks you could make against me.
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,9,Sat Jul 11 18:05:41 2015 UTC,"If that was indeed a mistake by /u/wwesmudge, don't you think that the mistake could have been avoided if you'd actually responded to individuals within the first reading?"
MHOC,3cx7rk,TheQuipton,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:10:22 2015 UTC,The House will have plenty of time to debate the second reading of the bill.
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,6,Sat Jul 11 21:02:46 2015 UTC,How do we know you will actually respond to comments? The house has 4 days to debate the first reading yet you posted one main comment.
MHOC,3cx7rk,TheQuipton,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:22:39 2015 UTC,I've appropriately responded to the debate that occurred during the first reading and you have my word that during the second I will respond to each and every comment.
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:24:06 2015 UTC,"I would like to commend the honourable member for at least responding to most questions in this thread so far, I hope you do stick to your word and this leads to improved communication in future."
MHOC,3cx7rk,Tim-Sanchez,2,Sat Jul 11 23:57:28 2015 UTC,"In section 2.1 of your Exam Reform Bill, it states "" For their general certificate of Secondary Education every pupil must have the chance of having each subject be graded partially via the use of coursework."" You excluded Maths from this rule, but if a student wants to avoid examination as much as possible and chooses the other 8 of their GCSE's to be marked by coursework, due to the calendar and timeline in the schooling system, it would result in a student having to submit 8 pieces of coursework over a one week period. So I ask you Mr.Secretary, when you state ""I've never produced legislation that would make such an event take place"", I ask you to remain honest in our chamber."
MHOC,3cx7rk,wwesmudge,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:08:28 2015 UTC,There is absolutely no reason why the deadlines for all pieces of coursework would clash so badly and if that did occur it would be a failure of the school and not my bill.
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:41:12 2015 UTC,"seeing as that's how the general school calendar works, yes, yes it would. All exams are done over the course of 1-2 weeks."
MHOC,3cx7rk,wwesmudge,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:43:21 2015 UTC,Coursework can be done over the course of the whole school year.
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:51:15 2015 UTC,"yes, but submission/deadline is at the end of the school year."
MHOC,3cx7rk,wwesmudge,2,Sun Jul 12 11:54:17 2015 UTC,Well then lets hope students don't leave it until the last minute!
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,7,Sun Jul 12 12:00:05 2015 UTC,"Mister Speaker, I'm sure we were all surprised to see the Education Secretary pass a piece of his legislation. Does he expect it to take him so long to pass a second piece?"
MHOC,3cx7rk,Kreindeker,5,Sat Jul 11 16:15:18 2015 UTC,Hear hear!
MHOC,3cx7rk,HaveADream,2,Sat Jul 11 16:16:00 2015 UTC,No I do not.
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,6,Sat Jul 11 18:10:02 2015 UTC,How can you justify not answering or responding to pretty much every comment on your most recent bill put forward to the House? It is frankly disgraceful that you aren't willing to defend bills that you yourself submitted and wrote
MHOC,3cx7rk,tyroncs,2,Sat Jul 11 16:27:54 2015 UTC,"I responded to every single comment, I just did so in a more succinct way than we often see. I will be present the house with a second reading of the bill as soon as possible where a more thorough debate can take place."
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,2,Sat Jul 11 18:24:49 2015 UTC,Are you sure?
MHOC,3cx7rk,HaveADream,2,Sat Jul 11 19:07:43 2015 UTC,Yes I am.
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,2,Sat Jul 11 20:31:24 2015 UTC,Did you even click the link?
MHOC,3cx7rk,tyroncs,2,Sat Jul 11 21:46:31 2015 UTC,Yes I did.
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,2,Sat Jul 11 22:36:53 2015 UTC,"That link shows him having posted a comment on your bill, with no response from you. Did you miss the point of his comment?"
MHOC,3cx7rk,tyroncs,3,Sat Jul 11 23:22:16 2015 UTC,I responded to all the comments. I just did so in one comment rather than replying to all of them individually.
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:27:08 2015 UTC,"That doesn't count, unless you expect them to constantly monitor every thread they have ever commented in how are they expected to know that you have given them a 'response'?"
MHOC,3cx7rk,tyroncs,7,Sun Jul 12 01:47:11 2015 UTC,"Mr Deputy Speaker,   How does the Secretary of State respond to the popular calls for him to resign?  Does the Secretary of State hear the frequent cries of ""Weak, Weak, Weak"" echoing through the house whenever a bill of his put forward, is so, how does he respond to such claims?"
MHOC,3cx7rk,Pallas_,2,Sat Jul 11 21:48:27 2015 UTC,I have no plans to resign.
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,7,Sat Jul 11 22:41:34 2015 UTC,"Why on the surface does it appear like the you, the education secretary is the only minister that actually does anything?"
MHOC,3cx7rk,lorindushar,2,Sat Jul 11 18:41:31 2015 UTC,A quick look at the glut of upcoming Government legislation will show that this isn't the case.
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,2,Sat Jul 11 20:40:18 2015 UTC,How on earth does it appear like that? Is the member losing his vision?
MHOC,3cx7rk,NoPyroNoParty,2,Sun Jul 12 09:13:32 2015 UTC,I believe the opposition have become so focused on trying to hound me out of office that they have lost all sense of perspective.
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,16,Sun Jul 12 11:42:58 2015 UTC,What stage of Education are you currently in?
MHOC,3cx7rk,tyroncs,10,Sat Jul 11 16:09:05 2015 UTC,"When questioned about 19.1% of Year 6 students being obese, you said it would be addressed with planed reforms to the curriculum. It has been almost 3 months since then, what have you done about it?"
MHOC,3cx7rk,tyroncs,3,Sat Jul 11 16:10:12 2015 UTC,Hear Hear!
MHOC,3cx7rk,HaveADream,2,Sat Jul 11 16:07:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this question. I began to produce legislation to change the curriculum, which went through several different incarnations. But after researching into how the national curriculum is normally altered and finding out it was done via a panel of experts I decided that this would be a more appropriate route to take. This is what has delayed the process.   I'm currently in the process of ironing out the details of how this panel will be created and how it will produce its proposals."
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,3,Sat Jul 11 16:08:03 2015 UTC,"But after researching into how the national curriculum is normally altered and finding out it was done via a panel of experts I decided that this would be a more appropriate route to take.   Then why did you suddenly decide to make every subject 30% coursework without consulting with 'a panel of experts?'  And considering that in the /r/MHOC we have no such thing, that is just a cop-out for not wanting to write anything"
MHOC,3cx7rk,tyroncs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:08:33 2015 UTC,"The panel of experts, which in our case would be a panel of MHOC members would specifically deal with the national curriculum."
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,3,Sat Jul 11 21:42:53 2015 UTC,"Unless you intend on making one, they do not currently exist. And even if they did, I doubt that a group of MHOC members from different parties would allow you to take credit for bills that essentially they wrote.  The best thing to do would be to write something on it, and then let the collective /r/MHOC critique it and suggest improvements. The issue there is, that would require you to actually write a half decent bill"
MHOC,3cx7rk,tyroncs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:53:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, something that has not yet been made doesn't currently exist. Thank you for pointing that out. I don't intend to take credit for anything I haven't wrote."
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,3,Sat Jul 11 21:55:25 2015 UTC,So are you going to try and create one?
MHOC,3cx7rk,tyroncs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:33:47 2015 UTC,I've already answered questions regarding my plans for National Curriculum reform.
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,2,Sat Jul 11 23:22:29 2015 UTC,"Link it to me, I am unable to find it"
MHOC,3cx7rk,tyroncs,4,Sun Jul 12 00:33:56 2015 UTC,"Mr Speaker, can the Secretary inform us of more 'reforms' that he wishes to make to  our Education system."
MHOC,3cx7rk,Totallynotapanda,2,Sun Jul 12 01:47:21 2015 UTC,I'm currently focusing on the measures laid out in the coalition manifesto.
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,4,Sat Jul 11 16:11:15 2015 UTC,"Mr Deputy Speaker,   Would the minister not agree that it is favourable to have as varied an education system as possible, and that having coursework for all subjects bar mathematics, is likely to be unfeasible at best, and damaging at worst?"
MHOC,3cx7rk,RachelChamberlain,2,Sat Jul 11 18:29:51 2015 UTC,The Exam Reform bill gives all students the option to take coursework as part of their overall grade. This gives students more options not less.
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,2,Sat Jul 11 16:17:11 2015 UTC,"So in a school, if there was 30 students taking English and 1 wanted to do coursework as well, would the school then have to then accommodate for that one student?  Also that would lead to each exam board having to provide another set of tests for those who choose to do coursework as well, which is a logistical nightmare"
MHOC,3cx7rk,tyroncs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:20:14 2015 UTC,Flexible learning is what 21st Century education looks like and the logistics of it our well within our grasp.
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,2,Sat Jul 11 21:46:09 2015 UTC,"We are not in the age where we are taught by a robots or where students don't require contact with a real teacher. If only a tiny minority of students 'choose' to do coursework, that causes major hassle to the teacher's and exam boards involved"
MHOC,3cx7rk,tyroncs,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:28:26 2015 UTC,Assessment will be prepared before students make any choice so the choice's they do make have no affect on the effort that teachers and exam boards have to go to.
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:46:34 2015 UTC,"Option!? I generally believe that the exam board decides what percentage of the course is CW/CA and not the student. I'm not sure that it is feasible to have each student choosing what portion of their course is CW/CA. I might want 20% CW but my mate Dave might prefer to have 60% CW. Also, It kinda wasn't specified anywhere in the bill this thing about flexiassesment."
MHOC,3cx7rk,Ajubbajub,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:44:00 2015 UTC,The second reading of the bill will make clearer what isn't explicit in the first.

MHOC,3cx7rk,TheInfernalRain,3,Sat Jul 11 22:36:29 2015 UTC,These principles are at the core of everything I try to do as Education Secretary and I hope to do more to move our Education system in this direction in the coming months.

MHOC,3cx7rk,alexwagbo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:57:35 2015 UTC,I thank the Right Honourable National MP. I honestly quite forgot that members could reply to the first question after the SoS. It hardly ever happens.

MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,10,Sun Jul 12 11:03:35 2015 UTC,How do you plan to promote British values in school?
MHOC,3cx7rk,MrEugeneKrabs,4,Sat Jul 11 18:06:22 2015 UTC,"Schools should be a place where students can be given the ability to think for themselves and make their own mind up about what values they hold dear and what values they spurn.  From a practical point of view, even I wanted to, it would be impossible to promote 'British values' in schools because nobody knows what they are.   Capitalism? Individualism? Empire building? Inequality? Racism?  Perhaps the honourable gentleman could be more explicit about what values are British and why these are not shared by other nations and what Britain has done to demonstrate that these values our British?"
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,7,Sat Jul 11 16:38:03 2015 UTC,"This is the  (irl) government guide to the teaching of British Values in schools.  I'm not sure how you can honestly disagree with most of these values.  This is, unless you agree with /u/Jas1066's beliefs on education where schools should not instill values at all (admittedly he goes further).  So do you believe schools have a role in instilling morality into students, and if so which morals? Do you disagree with promoting any on the link I provided?"
MHOC,3cx7rk,treeman1221,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:17:41 2015 UTC,"These are not 'fundamental British Values' they are just widely held values. There is nothing necessarily British about them. In fact, we have a history of not being democratic, not respecting different faiths, individual liberty or the rule of law.  What we should be doing is teaching children about differing values and giving them the tools to critically analyse them.  I don't want to instil any set of beliefs as 'inherently British' when no such thing exists. That's not what schools are for."
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,3,Sat Jul 11 21:33:53 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from, but the questions remain:   So do you believe schools have a role in instilling morality into students, and if so which morals? Do you disagree with promoting any on the link I provided?"
MHOC,3cx7rk,treeman1221,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:04:37 2015 UTC,I've answered this question.
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,8,Sat Jul 11 22:06:55 2015 UTC,How about putting an end to the left constantly turning a blind-eye to Islamic sexual grooming in British schools? I'm sure we can all agree that isn't a British value
MHOC,3cx7rk,calgievlogz,2,Sat Jul 11 22:34:14 2015 UTC,Any form of sexual abuse in schools is unacceptable and the risk to children is hightened when we relax regulations and fail to properly keep schools to account. I will shortly be giving Ofsted the power it needs to route out the issues we keep seeing in free-schools and take appropriate measures where it finds problems.
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,6,Sat Jul 11 20:20:57 2015 UTC,Resign!

MHOC,3cx7rk,Djenial,3,Sat Jul 11 18:31:13 2015 UTC,Why do you wish to abolish School League Tables? Should parents not be able to see how good a school is before sending their child too it?
MHOC,3cx7rk,tyroncs,2,Sun Jul 12 00:43:55 2015 UTC,"We can't run our education system on the basis that we need to give individuals as much ability as possible to get ahead of each other in the rat race. The end result of that is that the same people still lose out and the same people still win. The point of school league tables was to attempt to introduce the free market into the classroom. Not only is that impossible given that the consumers in this case have a very limited choice in where they go , but it also does nothing to improve the education system and instead makes it harder for schools to improve there performance."
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,2,Sat Jul 11 16:29:49 2015 UTC,"The thing is, if exams worked as they were designed, then your success at an exam would directly equal your attainment in that subject.  So measuring schools by how well they teach people is something I don't see an issue with. It encourages schools to not be lax with their teaching, and if done properly increases standards"
MHOC,3cx7rk,tyroncs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:34:13 2015 UTC,The trouble is that what we end up doing is measuring schools based on how well they teach students to take exams.

People want to give their Children the best in life, those who can afford it, send them to a Private School. As a five-year old I was given the choice to go to Private School or not and I said yes, believing I would be better off there.   Whether Private Schools are better or not, simply assaulting the population who choose to send their kids there for believing in Private Schools is abhorrent, I'm sure you would not want to be  assaulted verbally and called Immoral for believing that state schools are better."

But the route issue is still the same. Economic inequality and stratification.   If we become a more equal society with equality of opportunity then this problem will lesson at a quicker rate than it currently does as individuals will be able to move through economic class's more quickly and our lifestyle will be less determined by our economic situation.

MHOC,3cx7rk,tyroncs,3,Sun Jul 12 01:30:11 2015 UTC,I've already answered this question. Because of this Government more money is now being invested in the schools system and LEA's now have more power to build schools when they need them. In addition a wage rise for most teachers will soon be announced. Overall these actions should help to reduce class size.
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,2,Sat Jul 11 16:18:30 2015 UTC,"No, it doesn't solve it :/  The point is, we are not recruiting enough teacher's. Building more schools doesn't help, and the wage rise for teacher's got rejected by the House, what makes you think they will accept it this time?"
MHOC,3cx7rk,tyroncs,2,Sat Jul 11 18:21:54 2015 UTC,If the budget is passed then I will use the money allocated to give teachers a wage rise and will not need any legislation to do so. This will attract more teachers into our newly built schools.
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,2,Sat Jul 11 20:12:54 2015 UTC,"Not really, paying more money to existing teacher's does little to help ones who are only just starting on the career ladder.

MHOC,3cx7rk,tyroncs,2,Sat Jul 11 20:37:33 2015 UTC,Raising the starting salary for teachers joining the profession attracts more teachers and so reduces class size. Try to keep up.
MHOC,3cx7rk,theyeatthepoo,2,Sat Jul 11 20:45:14 2015 UTC,The fact is trying to keep on paying teacher's more and more without fixing any issues there is in the teaching profession is a short term solution at best.

Just to start with, government statistics have the average cost of a domestic energy bill at £802a month, which already increases the costs to £2,847,902,000.  This is the cost per month.  Given that it covers 6 months, in reality, in a given financial year, this will cost £17,087,412,000.  Not exactly an insignificant sum!  I'd also be interested to know where the ""50%"" figure comes from, because I think the Honourable Members would be surprised to learn it may be somewhat higher than that.  Using this information, and given that, in the realm of government welfare spending we do not consider other sources of welfare to be ""income"", it would not be unreasonable to expect the true proportion to be 60%, 70%, or even higher!"

I will admit that I am slightly mistaken on the figures and will amend this officially in the next reading.   I have redone the figures here  This bill states that the Pension is considered income, hence only 51% will be applicable, going by the link you have provided.

MHOC,3cxeuy,Totallynotapanda,2,Sat Jul 11 19:52:32 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, you're correct in that it's the cost per year.  However, you missed my point with the pension and income.  While the pension is considered income, a large proportion of the income to many pensioners is based around the rest of the welfare system, such as Housing Benefit.  In many cases, this alone takes up more than 50% of their income, so either you're saying that you didn't take this into account (meaning that you're ""50%"" figure is incorrect, and should be higher) or you did, meaning that people who receive more than about £7400 a year in combined benefits excluding state pension will not receive this subsidy.

Since there is no way to know how much these people are paying doing the figures doesn't seem possible. However, assuming that only half of the pensioners eligible for this scheme receive the Winter Fuel Payment at £200 (Some could get as much as £300), we could say that £600 million pounds will be saved, making the cost potentially £1.884 billion."

This bill will make it so that people whose primary income is the State Pension shall have their electricity and gass bills paid for 6 months of the year.

MHOC,3cxeuy,Totallynotapanda,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:07:49 2015 UTC,The State Pension is capped at £115.96. Someone's weekly income could only be below £231.90 for them to be eligible for this scheme. No one earning £600 p/w is eligible.
MHOC,3cxeuy,AlbertDock,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:15:28 2015 UTC,"Under the new rules both partners in a couple could get £151, giving them an income of £302.  If a private pension increased their income to £600 p/w they would still have over half their income as State Pension. Hence they would qualify."
MHOC,3cxeuy,Totallynotapanda,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:21:17 2015 UTC,I wrote the bill in regards to the individual and not household. I will amend this in the second reading.

One of my favourite quotes is ""We measure our success not just in how we show our strength abroad, but in how we care for the weakest and most vulnerable at home."" - Real Life Conservative Party Manifesto 2015.  The purpose and intentions of this bill are simply to care for the weakest, and most vulnerable in society.  I encourage MPs to support this Bill, especially within the Conservative Party and the Official Opposition."
MHOC,3cxeuy,ThatThingInTheCorner,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:29:55 2015 UTC,"I think we should try to lower the costs by only providing the subsidies between the winter months of December to February. It is unfair that young people will be working to pay the bills of the elderly, whom are often rich, even if they are only receiving the state pension as their primary income."
MHOC,3cxeuy,Totallynotapanda,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:09:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know about you but I find it pretty cold in October. Wikipedia has the average temperature at 8.5°. Should the House find the cost too extensive I will consider this, but the elderly should not be subject to temperatures such as this."
MHOC,3cxeuy,joethepro36,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:06:44 2015 UTC,"Given the current disparity between the young and pensioners, I do not support this bill.  As a fellow member of the house and a socialist at that has pointed out, the costs of this bill will be prohibitive. With such pressure on the young in this day and age I do not wish for this country to spend more time and energy extracting ever more tax from the younger generations to pay for a generation that is surprisingly well off.  I realise that not supporting every single benefit for the elderly is an unpopular position but £17bn a year is quite a bloody lot! Just imagine if the same value was invested into our educational system. Certainly no threats of tuition fees or student debt then.  I urge my fellow members to reject such a bill that places a greater tax burden on the young."
MHOC,3cxeuy,Totallynotapanda,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:53:06 2015 UTC,I don't think the Honourable Member read my comment. The Secretary miscalculated. The costs are only around £2.5 billion (And that is without removing the cost of the current Winter Fuel Subsidy). Nowhere near the 17 billion the secretary stated.
MHOC,3cxeuy,joethepro36,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:02:08 2015 UTC,"Well then it is not so bad as I feared then.  Even so I oppose the bill on the same grounds as I stated. The elderly have enough help as is in this members opinion, the young are the ones who need help these days."
MHOC,3cxeuy,bgpk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:21:52 2015 UTC,"Sorry, i've been away for a few days. I really don't see this as a viable bill. Although it's a good idea morally, economically it's frankly horrendous. The £2,244,232,000 estimate is quite a large way off the reality of the cost.  There may be room for the fuel allowance to change, but for an entire new bill to subsidise electricity also is too much in my honest opinion."
MHOC,3cxeuy,Totallynotapanda,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:34:12 2015 UTC,It is way off indeed! It should only be about £1.8 billion pounds. I redid the figures below. I suggest you look at my exchanges with the Chancellor.

MHOC,3cwho0,WineRedPsy,7,Sat Jul 11 17:42:14 2015 UTC,"Interesting article about the Cavaliers, although I still cannot fathom what actually separates them from the Vanguard. This is especially the case if they intend to stand in the commons as the article implies, as this would reject them being a true party of the aristocracy, a principle on which they were founded.  Ultimately, the Vanguard is a loose union of traditionalist and monarchists (amongst other things). We defend the power of the monarch. The Vanguard are arguably more in favour of a new aristocracy, since the old aristocracy is either gone, unable, or sometimes unwilling to defend our national identity, customs, and traditions. We put forth British culture before all else, and we stand as a Third Positionist party, transcending the left and right wing divides.  I have found the Cavaliers to be true and loyal men, and to find good allies is always welcome. But, one still wonders, what is the actual difference in ideology and policy between the Vanguard and the Cavaliers? From what I have read about them, I really cannot tell, and can only assume that the issue is aesthetic: The Vanguard seem like a scary fascist party, the Cavaliers a friendly and innocuous monarchist party. Let us hope that the existence of two such similar parties does not make our true conservative position weaker. The Vanguard are already small, and there are few votes to be split."
MHOC,3cwho0,AlbrechtVonRoon,7,Sat Jul 11 13:22:34 2015 UTC,"The article in the paper was written about three weeks ago if I remember correctly so it is obviously lacking in the detail we have since established.  Firstly the Vanguard are an explicitly Fascist party. Rather than being conservatives they are revolutionaries who wish to fundamentally change the way Britain is governed. As a Fascist party they do not believe in the three fundamental values this country was built on. Life, Liberty, and Property. These are the stark truths of any Fascist party. Despite being socially right-wing they cannot truly be called Conservatives for they desire a fundamental and radical shift in our way of governance.  The Cavaliers are a Christian and a Conservative party, we don't want any revolutionary changes in society and will always defend the three promises Britain gives to all of its children. We also reject the enlightenment's legacy of building from first principles. We believe a nation should be built and evolve in an organic and fluid way with a constitution that facilitates this and also evolves in the same way.  Our economic position can perhaps be described as Distributism with a family based slant, a Capitalist system which wishes to see the means of production and distribution placed primarily in the hands of families in the form of small family run business, is intended to slow and perhaps reverse the decline of the role of the family in society. It will also take the mass of economic and political power out of the hands of the big metropolitan businessmen who own so much of this country and disperse it in a wider way. This also clearly means we favour Agrarianism over the bourgeois metropolitan way of life. We would want to achieve this using small changes over many many years in an orderly and gradual fashion.  We believe every Briton should have the opportunity to give back to their nation and their people to their fullest extent, for this reason we continue to support an effective state education system but also support our historic and expansive Independent schools. We also believe for the same reasons that every Briton should have free healthcare via the NHS as we do today and would fight to preserve the NHS.  We are also a party which takes environmentalism very seriously and wish to do all we can in aiding the preservation of England's green and pleaseant lands, whether that means stopping rampant urban development, or encouraging micro-generation(in line with an Agrarian way of life), or even encouraging larger scale environmentally friendly methods of electricity production. Anything that preserves our beautiful land is something we wish to pursue.  There is obviously more to the Cavaliers, but perhaps this helps build upon why we exist as a distinct entity from the Vanguard.  I will also explain why it is conceivable that we may have to run in the House of Commons. Firstly we never wanted to run in the Commons but due to the way that Lords appointment works it is going to be extremely difficult for someone who is not or has not been an MP to be appointed an Achievement Lord and also a very large number of Lords will come from Party Lords based on Commons performance anyway. Simply, to increase our number of Lords we sadly have to run in the Commons."
MHOC,3cwho0,DevonianAD,7,Sat Jul 11 15:25:21 2015 UTC,"Firstly the Vanguard are an explicitly Fascist party.   Simply not true, the manifesto proclaimed us explicitly as a royalist and nationalist party.   we don't want any revolutionary changes in society   Right, so how on earth will you bring about distributism, a completely foreign ideology that has never existed in these lands. Like us, you rightly oppose the cosmopolitan bohemian ways of the cities, but in attacking those ways you are being a revolutionary of sorts, in so far as this is a very serious reaction against the current manner of things. I do not oppose this view, but I think it misleading to argue that this is simple reformism, when it is not.   Life, Liberty, and Property.   These are enlightenment principles. They are in the God damn Declaration of Independence you traitor.  If there is a distinct identity, the Cavaliers are not a conservative party. The Vanguard actually reject enlightenment principles. We are a party of instinct and emotion. We believe that man is instinctively a religious animal, and this is why we put forward the preservation and expansion of the role that the Anglican Church (that is, the Church of our monarch) plays in society. We argue that current developments in history have not been the result of organic and historic processes that emphasise the corporated and hiearchical nature of society, but rather that society has been changed artificially by abstracted ideas and principles, and in this sense we are revolutionary, but remain conservative. Bismarck was both a revolutionary and a conservative, the two are not incompatible when we view conservatism as an ideology, not just a passive mindset.  Honestly, the only thing that makes you 'distinctive' is the liberal nonsense at the beginning about 'Life, Liberty, and Property', rather than say, 'Faith, Flag, and Family', which we promise, followed by an odd revolutionary platform of land redistribution.  And now you are standing in Parliament? The Cavaliers have become the Roundheads!"
MHOC,3cwho0,AlbrechtVonRoon,5,Sat Jul 11 15:38:55 2015 UTC,At what point can we stop using the 'Vanguard is a fascist party' card. I've read this about fifteen times in the past few months and every time it has been refuted.
MHOC,3cwho0,sZjLsFtA,8,Sat Jul 11 18:34:14 2015 UTC,"The Vanguard was created by a Fascist, is led by a Fascist, attempted to name itself the BUF but was refused. It adopts a Corporatist policy and a Nationalist policy, two core tenets of Fascism.  The party is clearly Fascist."

MHOC,3cwho0,Spudgunn,3,Sun Jul 12 11:44:25 2015 UTC,"If the Vanguard was a fascist party I wouldn't have been allowed to be in it. I'd probably be a disgruntled member of the so-called Conservative Party after leaving the Vanguard on mutual disagreement. If Albrecht, who has full power over the party, wanted to make it explicitly fascist he could have, I would respect his authority to do so, and would most likely not be in the party.  But that's not what happened, Albrecht in his wisdom opted to broaden things out. This is clear from our manifestos, the debates we have within the party and so on. There's plenty clear evidence that you're wrong on this, but Albrecht's word alone should be enough if you are a gentleman. Are you a gentleman?"

MHOC,3cs11h,Jamie54,2,Fri Jul 10 08:36:52 2015 UTC,if i had a mental illness i think the last thing i would want to do is go and talk to a student about it. I'm sure going to see a psychologist who doesn't do a good job would be very bad for someone with a mental illness.   The main complaint i hear is that mental illness isn't taken as serious as someone with a physical illness. You wouldn't send a sick person to see a lone student.
MHOC,3cs11h,sZjLsFtA,4,Fri Jul 10 08:46:08 2015 UTC,"Why not? It's a frustrating misconception that 'student' doctors, registrars, nurses etc. are somehow inadequate. We need to move away from the idea that unless 'Dr' is someone's title they are insufficient.   I see you edited your comment. Registrars frequently see patients alone without supervision.  edit: Upon clarification of what these terms mean, I do in fact agree with you. University students cannot practice on people. It's unethical."
MHOC,3cs11h,Jamie54,2,Fri Jul 10 09:04:46 2015 UTC,Every student would gossip about their patients problems with their friends. Everyone knows that.

MHOC,3cs11h,sZjLsFtA,3,Sat Jul 11 00:17:56 2015 UTC,"Opening Speech  Mr Speaker,  One in four people in this country experience a mental health disorder at any given time, yet mental health only accounted for 13% of NHS spending in 2012. Suicide is currently the biggest killer of male adults, yet you could be waiting on a list for over a year to get treatment, despite the existence of cost-effective treatments. Self Harm in the UK is higher than anywhere else in Europe, yet local NHS planners aren't obligated to spend the mental health budget for their intended purpose.  Mr Speaker, I plan to change all of this. I lost someone to suicide and it was one of the most painful experiences of my life, and this happens everyday in the United Kingdom. I know that I can't stop it but I hope that this bill can make a progress towards reducing the list of names that lose their lives due to something that we, as a society, have attached a stigma on.  Mr Speaker, this bill will ensure those budgets are used for their correct purpose, this bill will ensure that people who need the help can get it, this bill will ensure that attitudes towards mental health will change, this will ensure that children can tell their parents if something is wrong, just as if they would if they had broken a finger. This bill will ensure that mental health is given the attention it deserves.  Today I call on the house to support this bill, it's time to make long-needed progress. It's time for people to get the help they need within a reasonable timeframe and it's time that young people aren't forced to travel out of their city to find a mental health support centre.   It's time for this to change.  Thank you."

MHOC,3cs11h,ThatThingInTheCorner,2,Sat Jul 11 10:37:40 2015 UTC,I fully support this bill. Mental health should be fully recognised as as important as physical health
MHOC,3cs11h,sZjLsFtA,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:41:04 2015 UTC,I agree that it is absolutely vital that students in schools need to be taught about mental health as part of the compulsory curriculum.
MHOC,3cs11h,HaveADream,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:42:36 2015 UTC,"Section B - Why only psychologists? There are mental health issues which are better treated by other forms of therapy. If it's some sort of first port of call, then it would be a huge waste of money in a lot of instanes. There is a reason beyond cost why low intensity therapists are used as a first referral, they are usually what is required. Psychologists aren't needed for the majority of mental illness. It would also be better if you specified what kind of psychologists, because it is a little vague. Layman definition usually is much broader than what it actually is. Furthermore this massively clashes with IAPT and it isn't clear how these two would function side by side.    Divert funding previously used for homoeopathy treatments to paying the staff mentioned in Section B    That nowhere near covers section B. Additionally, homeopathy saves the NHS money by diverting patients to these forms of treatment. So it's not a suddenly freed up money pot. Allergy, mental health etc referrals who initially would have been referred for homeopathy will now be referred to largely more expensive treatments. That's not a bad thing, it's just short sighted to think that money isn't already needed elsewhere. Homeopathy is cheap, increasing our staffing of psychologists by many times over would cost millions more than homeopathy.   I'm also not sure d.17 is enough money, is this figure reinforced by evidence?"

Correct, that's why that figure was used - to cover it all (an annual cost, I think? Which I'll amend in the second reading.)

MHOC,3cs11h,AlbertDock,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:32:05 2015 UTC,"Would you suggest all therapists?   No not really, my view of it was when I introduced the IAPT renewal a while back, was that low intensity therapists are generally well suited to dealing with anxiety and depression, but that high intensity therapists and psychologists should be more readily available. Improving access is 100% needed, but it is far more effective to provide IAPT services as first point of access (barring an immediate referral to psychotherapy/psychologists/psychopharm etc.) and then the LIT referring onto other mental health practitioners as deemed appropriate. That would involve reopening and strengthening mental health centres as you want to do, but I would think it better to ensure that they have increased funding so they can have larger intake and quicker triage which again is something you want implemented. All in all I think access to psychologists at the GP office is unnecessary.   I would think you need to increase the funding a lot yes, but it's worth it I think. Mental health is due a bigger emphasis."
MHOC,3cs11h,Tim-Sanchez,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:58:16 2015 UTC,The idea of having peoples condition assessed by part qualified students is appalling.  How is this system better than having a GP refer a patient who he thinks will benefit from seeing a psychologist? I fail to see why secondary schools could not deliver mental health education themselves.
MHOC,3cs11h,That_One_Directioner,2,Fri Jul 10 12:42:28 2015 UTC,The idea of having peoples condition assessed by part qualified students is appalling.   This already happens for non-mental illnesses.

I'd won't comment on the ""you are not funny or cool..."" part but those aren't your words. You were just, in that post, deploying the childish response of copying someone's exact words and throwing them right back at them with a little alteration. This is frankly a terrible way to argue anything, it's juvenile, and I've noticed it's mostly the American communists who do it.  So then you (again by copying what he previously said to you and twisting it) implied he was a fascist. By saying someone should go back to /r/fascism, you imply that that is a place where they frequent. So you implied he was a fascist.  After implying he was a fascist, essentially calling him one, you admitted to me:   I know he's not a fascist   So you called him a fascist while it was clear in your mind he wasn't one.  What?  What can actually make a human being call someone something they know, clearly, that they are not? What could drive a thinking, intelligent being to actually do that? Well, I don't know.

MHOC,3cpset,bobbybarf,3,Thu Jul 9 21:03:42 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, my beliefs in Conservatism spring from the idea that we have a good country overall, and therefore radical change is not required; in fact, there are many areas where change would be a great danger to the country as we have it today. It's not the rejection of progress, but the rejection of progress for progress' sake. Therefore retaining our institutions and values is core to this. These values especially include community spirit and working for the country + society.  There are also key economic principles which are important - the idea that it's an individuals work and innovation that gives them the life they want, not the state; encouraging business and innovation; making work pay; and not intervening in a market that largely functions best on its own. This isn't just ideological, because a strong economy means a closer society and a stronger country."

MHOC,3cpset,InfernoPlato,3,Fri Jul 10 07:55:09 2015 UTC,How can the Westminster parties better focus their policy to include the whole of the country?  Specifically economically.

MHOC,3cpset,MorganC1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:58:23 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, 100%. I am hoping to be able to write some legislation before the end of the parliament on this issue."
MHOC,3cpset,treeman1221,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:55:41 2015 UTC,Thank you for your response!
MHOC,3cpset,Cocktorpedo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:12:42 2015 UTC,"It depends really, there are certainly types of loans which are immoral, like using loan sharks. I also think some of the costs of payday loans have gone too far, and there needs to be a proper education campaign and strict advertising rules to stop them taking too much of an advantage of people - but they do offer a service, so I wouldn't ban them entirely."
MHOC,3cpset,willo77,2,Fri Jul 10 07:47:55 2015 UTC,"Following more disruptive tube strikes, is it time to start investing in an automated replacement?"
MHOC,3cpset,Duncs11,2,Thu Jul 9 21:01:43 2015 UTC,That wouldn't stop strikes. All it would do is change the people who could shut the tube down. An automated system still needs controllers.
MHOC,3cpset,Cocktorpedo,2,Thu Jul 9 21:39:21 2015 UTC,"No it doesn't, do you not know what automated means boy?"
MHOC,3cpset,willo77,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:08:22 2015 UTC,I also understand the difference between automated and autonomous.
MHOC,3cpset,TheQuipton,2,Thu Jul 9 22:12:26 2015 UTC,Exactly you get something autonomous to run something automated.
MHOC,3cpset,Cocktorpedo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:13:12 2015 UTC,"No. Automated means done by machine. Autonomous means working entirely on it's own without interference from outside. Even the most sophisticated mechanisms we have, have people overseeing them if they are critical."
MHOC,3cpset,AlbertDock,2,Thu Jul 9 22:17:37 2015 UTC,"But it is not necessary, google cars are coming, we already have drones that fly themselves, if they can do it with cars and planes then doing it with trains is laughably simple."
MHOC,3cpset,Cocktorpedo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:07:39 2015 UTC,"Drones and driverless cars still rely on a human to tell them where and when to go. Driverless cars are still in their infancy and have a long way to go.  At present if they detect a fault in their systems, they stop. This may be fine for an experimental car, but what happens when people are stuck in a tunnel?"
MHOC,3cpset,AlbertDock,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:01:23 2015 UTC,"Yes and we can tell trains where and when to go lol, years in advance."
MHOC,3cpset,Cocktorpedo,2,Fri Jul 10 19:33:25 2015 UTC,"Should the UK attempt to limit tax avoidance even if it isn't done unilaterally (as in, by other countries)?"
MHOC,3cpset,AlbertDock,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:06:05 2015 UTC,"Of course it should. We charge a tax, it should be paid."
MHOC,3cpset,Djenial,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:56:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, though we should focus on a multilateral approach so that it does not harm Britain."

MHOC,3cptna,mg9500,2,Thu Jul 9 20:31:20 2015 UTC,I will be standing for chairman.
MHOC,3cptna,mg9500,2,Thu Jul 9 20:53:05 2015 UTC,I am an MP
MHOC,3cptna,demon4372,2,Mon Jul 13 16:44:47 2015 UTC,Never mind. Sorry. I'm on mobile and since I saw your other comment I skim read and got you confused with a pirate
MHOC,3cptna,SPQR1776,2,Mon Jul 13 16:47:38 2015 UTC,"I'd like to stand for chairman.  Manifesto:  I think I might make a good chairman for the Constitutional Committee. I am no stranger to the legislative process, having been an MP since the second general election, and having authored six bills. As for the skills needed for the position: to be organised and administer the business of the committee, this is certainly something which I feel I can handle well. I am a very well organised person and I have experience managing groups. For a while I was the one who managed all the business of the Communist Party: posting polls, poking at people to vote, and sending out messages to any new members. In comparison to that, which was incredibly time consuming, managing a five person committee will not be difficult. I also believe myself to be both friendly, trustworthy, and unbiased, which will all be good qualities to have in this position."
MHOC,3cptna,TheQuipton,2,Mon Jul 13 16:52:23 2015 UTC,"Manifesto:  Hello, I’m /u/TheQuipton and I am running for the chairman of the amendment committee. I have written multiple bills and motions and know how integral efficiency is in getting legislation through the house and as amendment committee chairman I would endeavour to get committee business organised quickly and effectively. I am an excellent administrator, I have proved this within my party over many previous months, as Head of Internal Committees, managing new party members, and running the successful Conservative election campaign.  I am one of the most active members of this house and a very approachable one at that. Obviously the chairman will act as any member of the committee would in the case of voting rights but whilst carrying out the administrative side of the role I will be entirely non partisan and open to suggestions from all sides. I will judge bills based on their merits, not the parties they have come from. I believe I have the qualities to succeed in this role and I hope you agree with me that I should be your amendments committee chairman."
MHOC,3cptna,mg9500,4,Sun Jul 12 12:59:17 2015 UTC,"Amendment Committee Chairman Manifesto  Accountability and Impartiality that only a member of a small party can deliver means that the chairman of the amendments must be a member of s smaller party.   The Conservative Party have by far the most Lords and MP and are in large numbers on the opposition front bench, any more representation on this committee means that they will have undue and undemocratic influence over the laws and policies of this nation, this cannot be allowed to happen.  UKIP are in coalition with the Conservatives and this will allow the official opposition to vote as a block to pass through whatever they like if allowed to take a majority of seats in this committee. Remember however undemocratic that is, we are talking about the opposition here, not the government that these islands voted for.  The prime minister's Green Party are rightfully taking there place as the party of government and are now into the second half of their term in office. Despite having fewer Lords than the opposition, parliamentary superiority, enshrined in the Parliament acts of 1911 and 1949 means that the Broad Left coalition will be able to supersede what a Conservative House of Lords government does, they were only the third largest party at the general election, forming a government is one thing, taking a stranglehold over all of the checks and balances that are imbedded into our parliamentary system is unforgivable.  The Communist Party had an electoral pact with the Socialist Party   During the general election which resulted in a fall from joint largest to joint third party status in the house. However with the same number of seats as the Green Party and the Deputy Prime minister's post they have just the same influence over the government as the Green Party. All the reasons that the chairmen of this committee cannot be a Green Party member also apply to the Communists.  Other parties have close relationships with some of these parties, most notably the Socialist Party in the above mentioned electoral pact.  That is why it is I that must be chairmen of the committee, to break the deadlock between the coalitions and consider each amendment on its merits and policies, not party politics. After the predictable and inevitable 2 votes versus 2 votes stalemate occurs from both sides of this house it will be the chairmen of the amendment committee that breaks the deadlock.  I therefore put it that this vote could be considered a vote of confidence in the government or official opposition, especially with the seconds plurality in the Lords. I am today pleading to this house and it's member don't let that happen, don't put party politics first. Go for a candidate who is respectable, reliable and trustworthy to lead this house in the amendment committee."
MHOC,3cptna,Spudgunn,11,Mon Jul 13 20:56:56 2015 UTC,If only you put that much thought and time into your speeches and debates for the Scottish independence referendum bill.
MHOC,3comp7,Timanfya,6,Thu Jul 9 15:09:55 2015 UTC,What's the European Union going to do now?
MHOC,3comp7,Spudgunn,8,Thu Jul 9 15:20:34 2015 UTC,They will just do the classic 'keep on repeating the referendum until the desired result occurs'
MHOC,3comp7,tyroncs,6,Thu Jul 9 16:57:20 2015 UTC,"Aye, only requiring ratification by the Government isn't suitable in a non-majoritan system."
MHOC,3comp7,RoryTime,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:18:24 2015 UTC,We could fix the treaties thing or we could rig the system so that 36.9% of the vote is a majority.
MHOC,3comp7,whigwham,6,Fri Jul 10 01:38:10 2015 UTC,"I personally like the current system. It still gives parliament the chance to intervene, if they believe that the treaty is unrepresentative."
MHOC,3comp7,Jas1066,7,Thu Jul 9 15:21:56 2015 UTC,"Parliament can intervene by continually delaying, but parliament needs the power to stop what it doesn't like."
MHOC,3comp7,AlbertDock,3,Thu Jul 9 15:42:13 2015 UTC,If parliament has no issues with it then they'll just vote in favour of it.
MHOC,3comp7,SPQR1776,4,Thu Jul 9 15:32:00 2015 UTC,Or if parliament has no issues they can just do nothing.
MHOC,3comp7,Jas1066,3,Thu Jul 9 15:34:32 2015 UTC,"Parliament isn't a single entity though, its made up of MPs who all have different opinions. If one MP disagrees then a vote must be held, else its undemocratic."
MHOC,3comp7,SPQR1776,3,Thu Jul 9 15:36:45 2015 UTC,"If one MP disagrees then they can submit a Motion, and therefore enable a vote to be held."
MHOC,3comp7,Jas1066,4,Thu Jul 9 15:38:34 2015 UTC,"That is a huge waste of time. Then the motion would need to be proposed, the motion debated, then voted on, then we'd need to vote on the treaty itself. Its far faster just to vote on the treaty."
MHOC,3comp7,SPQR1776,3,Thu Jul 9 15:40:16 2015 UTC,"But it deserves to be debated in such a way, if somebody objects to it, else you risk being undemocratic."
MHOC,3comp7,Jas1066,2,Thu Jul 9 15:44:19 2015 UTC,Which is why instead you simply discuss the treaty and then vote on it.
MHOC,3comp7,SPQR1776,4,Thu Jul 9 15:46:09 2015 UTC,"Opening Speech    Mr Speaker,  It has come to my attention that any government can sign any treaty without the approval of this house. This is undemocratic and is open to abuse.  Therefore I submit this bill which will ensure the democracy of Parliament, a theme on which I believe we can all agree.  /u/AlbertDock"
MHOC,3comp7,AlbertDock,2,Thu Jul 9 15:10:21 2015 UTC,My thanks to the Speaker for bringing forward this bill.
MHOC,3comp7,SPQR1776,4,Thu Jul 9 16:04:25 2015 UTC,This is an important step forward to making our system more democratic.
MHOC,3comp7,AlmightyWibble,3,Thu Jul 9 15:20:27 2015 UTC,Are we going to be going through every treaty that's been ratified before then if this passes? 'Cause that sounds really tedious.
MHOC,3comp7,SPQR1776,4,Thu Jul 9 15:32:18 2015 UTC,"I doubt there will be very many treaties, we've only had one so far."
MHOC,3comp7,AlbertDock,4,Thu Jul 9 15:37:30 2015 UTC,There need only be one vote. The government will not be in a position to make amendments.  How hard is it to read through and vote?
MHOC,3comp7,HaveADream,4,Thu Jul 9 15:39:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with the Right Honourable Gentleman's bill, every law in this country goes through this house, it's time to make international treaties a part of that."
MHOC,3comp7,KingOSwing,2,Thu Jul 9 15:46:22 2015 UTC,"Hear, hear!"
MHOC,3comp7,whigwham,2,Thu Jul 9 17:00:25 2015 UTC,I believe the majority of law passed is actually secondary legislation where the Government is enabled to pass law without parliament.
MHOC,3comp7,TheQuipton,4,Thu Jul 9 17:41:29 2015 UTC,A great motion /u/AlbertDock and top work for the speakers for fast-tracking it through to keep it relevant (I think that happened anyway)
MHOC,3comp7,TheInfernalRain,3,Thu Jul 9 15:53:16 2015 UTC,"This is a very simple bill, yet a very important one. Democracy should always be used to decide big decisions, and as such, I am entirely in favour of the bill."
MHOC,3comp7,Mepzie,2,Thu Jul 9 15:54:15 2015 UTC,Great bill. The current system is simply undemocratic and needs to be changed.
MHOC,3comp7,Chasepter,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:46:42 2015 UTC,I'm actually not a fan of this idea.  The people elect a government to represent them and through this they have the legitimacy to sign treaties.  It seems likely this will seriously limit foreign diplomacy.  Often treaties take many hours of debate and compromise before something is agreed upon and the fact that our government would then have to return to the UK to get it voted on?  It seems like a good idea at first glance but would be terrible in practice.
MHOC,3comp7,AlbertDock,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:48:23 2015 UTC,"On the contrary, it strengthens our position. It means we can say to other countries our parliament would not accept your proposal, so you need to come up with one which is acceptable to them."
MHOC,3comp7,Delstein,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:16:18 2015 UTC,"While I agree with the bill, how is it going to be determined whether the treaty will be ratified by referendum or by Parliament?"
MHOC,3comp7,AlbertDock,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:27:32 2015 UTC,Either would be a mandate to sign the treaty.
MHOC,3comp7,tand324,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:28:49 2015 UTC,"I believe that a treaty should get both a majority in Parliament and of the people as by definition, a loss of sovereignty."
MHOC,3comp7,AlbertDock,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:19:00 2015 UTC,I believe either a majority in Parliament or a referendum would be enough. We can't have referendum too often.
MHOC,3comp7,tand324,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:32:29 2015 UTC,"Sure we can, Switzerland has them quite often, so does Ireland. Plus, treaties don't happen often as well. In addition, parliament is no always representative of the people. (I'm looking at you 2015 election)"
MHOC,3comp7,AlbertDock,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:55:43 2015 UTC,"At present the government can decide to sign a treaty, without consulting parliament. An internal government vote isn't necessary. So this bill is a great step towards democracy. While we may disagree on a referendum I hope you can support this bill."
MHOC,3comp7,tand324,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:16:18 2015 UTC,"100% agree on that point, moves towards greater democracy are good"
MHOC,3comp7,wwesmudge,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:17:46 2015 UTC,"I whole heartedly support this bill but from my understanding we would not be able to do it due to EU restrictions, would the right honourable gentleman please respond if he understands otherwise."
MHOC,3comp7,AlbertDock,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:03:07 2015 UTC,My understanding is this. We are able to reject treaties which are not part of our EU membership. We have signed up to the EU and this has been endorsed by two referenda. If however the EU wanted to extend it's mandate and required a new treaty the rules I propose would apply. I am unaware of any EU restrictions on requiring any process before ratifying a treaty. If the honourable member believes otherwise I would ask him to point to where he understands any restriction is implied.
MHOC,3comp7,da_drifter0912,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:34:00 2015 UTC,Can we make a provision that treaty ratifications are a matter of confidence for the government? This would keep the government to account with something as important as this. It would also give the Prime Minister a way to recourse via a general election should he wish to take the treaty case to the people.
MHOC,3comp7,AlbertDock,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:10:42 2015 UTC,I don't believe that's the right way. If there is a great enough lack of confidence in the government then there are ways and rules to call a VONC.
MHOC,3cop7s,Timanfya,11,Thu Jul 9 15:28:37 2015 UTC,"Mr Speaker,  I'm not sure I agree in making everything but Maths have coursework. What I was expecting from this bill is to change the system from how it currently is and instead of making children learn how to remember, they are taught how to think and how to learn. GCSE's in the past were about using your mind to explore concepts that you have learnt, and now they're fact-based knowledge tests.  Plus, Coursework in EVERY subject? That's not feasible.   I'm not sure I agree with this bill."
MHOC,3cop7s,HaveADream,4,Thu Jul 9 15:34:22 2015 UTC,"I agree, actually changing the way exams work might be a much better idea than this. As I said above, it changes from forcing students into exams to forcing students into coursework. One-size-fits-all shouldn't be the way education works for our students."

MHOC,3cop7s,Pallas_,7,Sat Jul 11 14:45:39 2015 UTC,"Ugh, no thanks. I struggled enough with doing 3 pieces of coursework in 2 years, let alone 9! Furthermore, these pieces of coursework will no doubt end up being set all around the same time, basically turning a month of each year into an A-Level student's personal hell."
MHOC,3cop7s,AlmightyWibble,3,Thu Jul 9 15:36:16 2015 UTC,"That's an excellent point actually. I only had to do 2 pieces of coursework, one in each year of my A level studies. To do 7 pieces, all coinciding, as well as doing homework for subjects would be an incredible burden for students."
MHOC,3cop7s,Tim-Sanchez,3,Thu Jul 9 15:40:29 2015 UTC,"Hear, hear!"
MHOC,3cop7s,RachelChamberlain,6,Thu Jul 9 15:46:52 2015 UTC,Coursework simply doesn't suit all subjects. I see what you're trying to get at Mr Poo but this goes way too far
MHOC,3cop7s,Jonster123,3,Thu Jul 9 15:49:25 2015 UTC,Hear hear!
MHOC,3cop7s,Tim-Sanchez,5,Thu Jul 9 16:04:54 2015 UTC,"I just get the sense that this bill has been written by someone who messed up their exams and their subsequent resits and so is angry at the exam system. This bill is written like an angsty teenage A level student is worried about what grades they're going to get.   Firstly the coursework stuff has been pointed out is utterly ridiculous - not just from the perspective that coursework takes a massive amount of time and is very easy to cheat on, and secondly it's both absurd to only exclude maths or exclude maths at all.  Secondly:   4.3 AS Level Assessment must be split into at least two separate exams per subject.   Great - that means that on top of half of my A2 year being spent doing coursework I also have to somehow be taught and revise a 3rd module - for example, in A2 history for AQA, one spends half the year learning an exam syllabus and half the year learning, researching and writing coursework - under these proposals, you would then also have to learn ANOTHER exam-worth of material  Thirdly:   4.4 Pupils will have the option to retake any A2 Level exam at least once.   When? When would someone have time to do this? during the couple of weeks-or-so between getting ones results and going to uni?   3.2 AS Levels will make up at least 30% of the total grade for the A-Level over two years.   I really can't tell if this bill is trying to increase or decrease pressure on young people in their education - if one's second A2 year accounted for 70% of an A level, I think the pressure would've driven me over the edge  Honestly, this government's attempts to legislate for education is appalling."

But as my honorable friends have pointed out, there are some flaws in his bill. Forcing every subject to have coursework is a little flawed, instead it should be up to the Exam Boards to choose the balance, and if coursework is the best thing for that subject, making blanket statements like that isn't helpful.   If the exam board thinks coursework is needed/a good thing, then they should have it. But legally requiring coursework in every subject is too black and white, the requirement for coursework on a subject by subject basis is far more nuanced than this bill suggests     2.3 For their general certificate of Secondary Education every pupil must have the chance of retaking any examination the take.

MHOC,3cop7s,ThatThingInTheCorner,3,Thu Jul 9 16:57:46 2015 UTC,"When I studied history at both AS and A2 level, the coursework took up 2 out of 3 terms of my A2 year. Having coursework compulsory at AS and A2 level would mean I would only spend 2 terms actually doing history work not related to a piece of coursework. I would find this way more stressful than exams+coursework, and in my opinion it is a waste of time.   For their general certificate of Secondary Education every pupil must have the chance of having each subject be graded partially via the use of coursework.   I don't really understand this wording, do you mean some students could choose to do coursework and others not? Or all do coursework but only some choose to be graded on it? If it's a choice this could be problematic in smaller schools.  Ultimately I feel the A level changes have gone too far from forcing students into exams to forcing students into coursework. Whilst not every student does well in exams, equally many students excel at exams and struggle with coursework. Why must these students now be forced to take two lots of extra coursework?  Also, what is coursework defined as? Would a comically small piece of coursework suffice?"

If we assume this bill passed, you have essentially bound yourself (and your Government) to make detailed changes to parts of the curriculum. Why not actually try and write some of these changes, and then showing it to us so we can debate their merits?  Take my bill on Foreign Language Education Reform. What you have done here is effectively like me writing for that 'The system has to change, and if this passed the Government has to change it.'   And you seemed to have missed and ignored the reasons why the RL Government is trying to move away from a coursework system. Cheating is rife, and in many cases it does little to actually help people learn.  Take for example in the Science GCSE's, you do what is called an 'ISA' which is supposedly where you design your own experiment and write the methodology of it, actually do it and then evaluate the results. But what it really comes down to is copying an experiment of the internet, making up the results so you have a nice graph and then writing down what you already know was supposed to happen.  Unless you can start making a effort to reform broken systems like this, having coursework for coursework's sake is pointless and will not solve any problems in the Education System. Furthermore if you did it subject by subject (like I did with my bill) it stimulates far more detailed and in-depth debate and actually leads to far more constructive changes.  And then if I actually start to critique the content of this bill itself -   2.1 For their general certificate of Secondary Education every pupil must have the chance of having each subject be graded partially via the use of coursework.   Ok, an examiner could make coursework count as 1% of the total grade of the course, and fulfill everything this bill obliges them to do. The whole point of legislation is that it is supposed to have no ambiguity to prevent loopholes like these.   2.3 For their general certificate of Secondary Education every pupil must have the chance of retaking any examination the take.   How many times?   1.1 From the 1st of August 2015 National Curriculum Assessments will cease to be taken for any pupils in schools controlled by their local education authority (LEA) or directly by the department of Education.   The teaching unions (who were the ones who spearheaded this campaign) wanted these tests to be replaced by Teacher Assessment which you have failed to introduce on this bill. Really it requires a whole bill on it's own.  By simply abolishing them without providing any replacement what you have done is made it so there is no way to monitor how students are doing throughout their school life. Whilst you may disagree about how it should be done, everyone agrees that we need to do it some way."

MHOC,3cop7s,treeman1221,6,Thu Jul 9 15:51:27 2015 UTC,"Mr Speaker,   Again TETP has swung his thundering fist in the direction of education with very little thought for what he is actually doing.  We saw from the doomed education provision bill that Mr Poo wants raise achievement and attainment of everybody. These reforms he has put to the house are too shallow and not broad enough.  \ 1. If we remove SATs completely, how is one able to measure attainment at the end of KS1&2? It is not just used to measure schools' performances but it is also used for setting target grades for GCSEs. This is incredibly useful for schools to know what their pupils should be getting. It is compounded with the fact that only LEA schools are exempt from these sadistic tests. I would like to see the minister move on to a system of continuous assessment throughout year  6 and maybe year 2 (you could probs scrap them for year 2s) so that the stress is not compounded into 1 week in May. I propose the idea that schools have to submit a handful of pieces of controlled writing as the literacy component of the SATs and then have something else for maths. I would also like to add a humanities/science part of the SATs to make the tests more comprehensive. Just scrapping SATs is not the answer, reforming them is.  2.1 I know other members have already said this but Mr Poo has failed to define what coursework is properly. Are we talking controlled assessment or coursework?  The minister has also failed to specify what percentage of the course must be 'coursework'.  2.2 I think there would be other subjects that should have no coursework for example further maths gcse.   2.3 Is there a limit on the number of retakes per module? I think it is wrong that you can keep redoing exams until you do good enough. What about terminal exams, i.e. the ones you do in June of y11? You can't get your results in August and say that these aren't my final grade, I'm going to do X, Y and Z modules again. If there is not terminus of the exams, no certificates can be issued. This certainly needs clearing up.  3.1 What is wrong with a 50/50 split. A lot of my friends were very stressed doing 50% of their course in year 13, it would be unwise to make to increase the workload by 40%. You would then also have an almost wasted year in the form of AS levels. I had just about enough to keep me happy in year 12 and I would have hated to have had 40% less work to do. One would also run into timing troubles unless the A2 course started after like christmas of y12, which given that your time doing a levels in actually 4 terms rather than 6 would make the split AS to A2 around 70/30.   3.3 Again coursework definition.   3.4 Again what about further maths?  3.5 At least once!? It is phrased so awkwardly. Also, there is a lack of clarity over whether it is your best score that counts from all your sittings or will we see a system where to resit, you have to forfeit your previous result?  The flaws of section 4 have already been addressed elsewhere apart from 4.3. What about more courcework based subjects like DT or English Lit? They only have one exam for a reason at the moment. The coursework element id so great that the exam only counts for about 40%. I must say that it would be unnessary to have 2 exams for that.  \ 5. The speed at which these reforms are coming in are so fast. 6 weeks!! I feel that new syllabuses would have to be written etc. and so that gives teacher, who are already under huge amounts of stress, no time to prepare their work for the year and schools no time to plan what their strategy is.  General things that are missing from this bill.   League tables. The stuff of nightmares to schools. There is so much you can do to change these evil things. The 5 A*-C measurement is incredibly flawed but yet the minster does nothing. What about other level 2 and level 3 qualifications that are not GCSEs and A levels? How are they affected? How are you going to reduce teacher and pupil stress? Mental heath calls to childline skyrocketed this year due to exams, yet the minister continues to put more pressure on kids and adults. Modular v Linear. Mr Poo has yet again failed to include an incredibly vital part of what should be hear. Can you take some modules during year 10 or are all exams taken in year 11?   My conclusion: The minister should withdraw this train wreck of a bill and hand the prime minister his resignation.  Mr Speaker, Would the minister also comment when the last time he took a public exam was.  Thank you."

MHOC,3cop7s,tyroncs,5,Thu Jul 9 17:02:26 2015 UTC,"I don't see why coursework is a positive thing. Exams test the ability of a student, and require the student to actually learn. Coursework is open to abuse, on behalf of teachers and students. Being able to learn something is a vital skill that employers will look for, exams test how well a student has learnt the subject. Whereas coursework could be a student compiling a list of information he/she only found several minutes ago. There is no learning there. It is testing nothing."
MHOC,3cop7s,mcr3527,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:55:44 2015 UTC,"Exams of course have some value and I don't favour their abolition. However to state that Coursework has no value is ludicrous. Coursework enables assessment based on work outside of simple knowledge retention that exams promote. Exams alone are a narrow method of assessment for both educators and employers, they do not provide a wide assessment of intelligence, and the skills themselves are narrow, dominantly being focused on knowledge retention, which isn't as useful in the modern world.   Coursework on the other hand is a different style of learning that allows a student to independently study and analyse work critically, a skill that is important for those seeking later employment and/or a University education. Analysis and judgement beyond retention of facts is an important skill, valued by employers.   In addition the idea that coursework is open to abuse has merit on paper, until you take into account that exam boards check for plagiarism and that coursework is again, not evaluated by the content of basic information.   Whereas coursework could be a student compiling a list of information he/she only found several minutes ago. There is no learning there. It is testing nothing.   This is fundamentally incorrect. Coursework in many subjects (I'll use English for example) are marked using several guiding points. These include structure, form, content, analysis and more. These are outlined in my example through Assessment objectives 1 to 4, in my specific example here, of AQA English Lit B.. Coursework tests many things and learning most certainly happens. To dismiss the notion of it having any complexity or intricacy is insulting to those who do it.   I'll also link /u/TheInfernalRain this comment, who made a similar comment below in this thread."

MHOC,3cop7s,mg9500,3,Thu Jul 9 18:31:13 2015 UTC,"OPENING SPEECH  Mr Speaker,  I wish for the house to ask itself a question today.  What do we wish education assessment to reflect?  My answer to this question is simple and lacks controversy. The assessment of students in education should measure the aptitude of a student in that subject on which they are being tested.   What I say to the house today is that as the situation currently stands, the grades that students achieve reflect less on their aptitude in a subject and more on there aptitude in taking the exam that is set. An over reliance on exams as a way to test our students is an attempt to push three dimensional complexity into two dimensional simplicity.   Examinations test certain abilities in students but do not reflect back at us a rounded and accurate understanding of the capabilities that different students possess.   That is why I am legislating to ensure that all students are given the opportunity to take coursework as well as exams.   By doing this the emphasis is put back on accurately assessing the knowledge of students rather than merely finding out what schools teach the test better and what students are more apt at taking exams.  This is of course just the start of ensuring that assessment in schools reflects more on the challenges students will face in adult life while also making sure that results more accurately reflect the abilities of students.  This bill also follows the path that Wales has already taken and abolishes SATs and thus school league tables, both of which have a detrimental effect on the quality of education students receive. Teachers will now have far more time to spend teaching students while students will be able to spend their education concentrating on learning rather than being taught to pass the test.  It is simply not a good use of a teachers time to be teaching a class how to do well in an exam. Teachers must be given the freedom to pass on their passion to students.   The principle reason for the existence of SATs was to create a national school league table and thus a sense of a free market of choice for parents when it came to picking schools for there children. The problem is that this 'free market' only ever existed for the middle class's and thus exacerbated inequality of opportunity.    We already know that by the time they are five a middle class child has an educational advantage over a working class child. Once this is the case the gap is rarely closed. School league tables have thus merely reflected back at us existing inequalities within out society. The budget just passed by this government does much to lessen these existing structural inequalities.   The ending of school league tables ends the idea that our education system is best managed by pitting each school against one another and reaffirms this governments view that to improve education in this country we must tackle the system as a whole.   Altogether then this Bill reaffirms that under this government and as long as I am Education Secretary no child will be left behind. No matter how poor or rich, no matter the colour of their skin or vocation of their parents. Every child will be given an equal opportunity to achieve extraordinary things.  I thus urge this house to pass this bill and continue the education revolution."
MHOC,3cop7s,theyeatthepoo,3,Thu Jul 9 17:05:20 2015 UTC,"This is an awful bill.   If a student performs better in exams, rather than in coursework, they should be able to take an A Level which has no coursework and vice versa with a BTEC.

Further Maths is self explanatory but science qualifications are supposed to give a the student enough laboratory experience to succeed at that subject at university. A research project would not help them with this and an assessed lab report style of coursework takes the emphasis away from the practical techniques and lab safety and onto dry academic rigor, which the student will be getting plenty of in the other facets of the course. A minimum percentage of the final assessed grade that the coursework/ practical assessment shall be would also neaten the bill up."
MHOC,3cop7s,thedexer102,2,Thu Jul 9 17:25:49 2015 UTC,"Mr Speaker,  I believe this is a bill with honourable intentions, but with many serious flaws. I too believe that exam-only testing of a students ability in a subject is inherently flawed, particularly if the student is geared away from exams, or in subjects with large practical aspects.  I think the biggest issue with forcing on coursework is that the system is so open to abuse. If you are talking of traditional, take-home coursework, this has to be out of the question; it's far too influenced by parents and even tutors if parents can afford them, surely a blight to the class-leveling education revolution.  Controlled  Assessments are no better, I've never had one where a teacher kept to the rules in terms of timing, help allowed, and marking. With both of these, there's also an issue that you're just ""jumping through hoops"", so in that sense people can be good at controlled assessments instead of the subject.  If you truly want to implement coursework as a significant factor of the course, you've got to thoroughly reform the system of doing coursework - ranging from far more (and more rigorous) non-staff invigilation to off-site work with little preparation. This will take away the more relaxed feel coursework normally has (which presumably benefits some students) but we simply can't bring back a system which is so blatantly abused. Obviously, these are major reforms which would be extremely challenging.   4.4 Pupils will have the option to retake any A2 Level exam at least once.   This is allowed, actually, however it remains up to universities whether to accept retaking students; I believe the UEA and Liverpool are the only (?) universities to accept re-takers. You are taking away a lot of freedom from universities in this regard, who are pretty knowledgeable in who they wish to accept."
MHOC,3cop7s,treeman1221,2,Thu Jul 9 20:09:12 2015 UTC,"It seems the Secretary's descent into madness has now entered into freefall mode. Rather than actually reform anything, the Secretary has decided that the best way for our students to learn is to pile on coursework which many will utterly struggle to complete.  The fact that people from the parties of the Government have come out opposing this speaks volumes.   As for retakes, no limit is set. Could a particularly ambitious but underperforming pupil constantly resit exams until they get the result they will never get? Could we find life exam-sitters? Would we find a new profession of people who coach 30 year olds out of the mindless process of examinations and into the real world. Unlimited or unspecified, this is a very weak part of some fundamentally flawed legislation.  I suggest that the Secretary withdraw this legislation and actually make some reforms that people do want. Not reforms that people on all sides are opposing."

MHOC,3clek5,NoPyroNoParty,7,Wed Jul 8 20:35:41 2015 UTC,"I'll start by saying that yes, many MHOC members were sparsely active, including myself. However, that was during exams, which made it difficult for a really effective discussion. I do acknowledge the great work many of the people working on the treaty did, but I still think a bad agreement should be rejected.     Firstly, as a treaty it is very much limited in scope. Some of the ideas brought up (climate change aid & refugees, shipping policies and practices, rights of the earth) were never followed up on. I think the conditions of the treaty played into this, which is why I think a second negotiation would improve it.   Second, the complications it creates are unnecessary. Carbon credit seems very cool, but on an international scale the advantage over targets aren't clear. Carbon trading has a big margin for error and rarely works outside of ideal and regional circumstances, like in the case of the EU ETS.   Thirdly, the categories that countries are put in doesn't make sense when just determined with GDP. The reason climate change agreements work and carbon trading works, is because it gives a competitive advantage to firms that reduce emissions. Due to competition between states and companies in a free market, a race to the bottom on environmental protection often occurs without these measures. However, this positive effect of carbon trading is diluted when two countries right beside each other aren't in direct market competition. Despite the modern globalised market, companies in the US compete more with Mexico than with Germany. So while US firms aren't looking for a competitive advantage over German ones in the same group in the treaty, they are looking for an advantage over Mexican firms. This competition is very much imperfect when they pay different prices for carbon. There is a reason the EU ETS was constructed in a regional free trading bloc, as opposed to a carbon trading program for the G7 for example."

Therefore, this house rejects the RMUN climate change treaty while urging the RMUN to organise a renegotiation of the treaty in the immediate future.

I really can't give an explanation as to why it happened beyond exam season, but that doesn't include everyone. I was certainly nagging people on skype to get involved but nothing was happening.

For example, I was in Hull last week and I saw that the toilet in the bus station required exact change only, 35p, now, I'm not sure about anyone else, but I don't carry 35p in exact change, and I imagine a lot of people don't.  This will stop such an inconvenience and allow people who need to go to the toilet, to go to the toilet. Even if homeless people do use the toilets, it's better they're sanitary and safe instead of excreting on the streets, which could be considered a health hazard and a thing I imagine not a lot of people want to see.  I am in complete support of this bill."

The fact is, pretty much everyone is able to fork up the 50p or whatever to use a public toilet. It really isn't a big thing to ask. Public councils aren't there to make a profit, if they aren't able to afford to provide toilets for free then there is a reason.  You say that they will be 'subsidies made available' but you don't say where this money is coming from. Is it from Central Government?   And even if they aren't really making any money from charging a small amount for the use of toilets, a price barrier acts against those who use them not for their intended purpose.

This bill seeks to eliminate this across the country, by making it illegal for local authorities and private establishments to charge people to use bathrooms - and if this means local authorities are unable to cover the full costs, then they will be allocated subsidies to cover the excess so they can be kept open.

MHOC,3cl9b0,TheBlueFederalist,3,Wed Jul 8 22:07:11 2015 UTC,Why? Why are we legislating on toilets?
MHOC,3cl9b0,Post-NapoleonicMan,2,Fri Jul 10 15:27:36 2015 UTC,"I think there's a law in Italy that you can use any establishments toilet without buying anything; so there's that.

MHOC,3cl9b0,Jas1066,2,Wed Jul 8 21:34:47 2015 UTC,"I am afraid that I must object to another one of my right honorable college's Bills. The wording in this bill is vague, and much more detail is needed, especially in the costing department, but that is beside the point. On the continent, as I'm sure many of you will be aware, it is perfectly normal for small charges to be in place for public toilets, and as a result, they are often much better looked after. Now, as a purely sanitary precaution, I support public toilets being free, however, forcing a business to do something isn't exactly my cup of tea, especially when it actually worsens society as a result."
MHOC,3cl9b0,Sephronar,2,Wed Jul 8 22:20:52 2015 UTC,Surprise Surprise
MHOC,3cl9b0,Jas1066,3,Wed Jul 8 22:37:34 2015 UTC,Maybe we'll agree on something one day...
MHOC,3cl9b0,AlbertDock,2,Wed Jul 8 22:42:19 2015 UTC,"1:a) I don't think there is a need to define what a toilet is.  It is common in law for definitions only to be given where there may be some disagreement over what an item is or what it may be. Public too is already defined in law as a place where the public may go whether charged or not. Furthermore I feel that some compensation should be given to businesses which provide public toilets, otherwise we may see them disappear.  Or we will see restaurants and similar establishments declaring the toilets private property and not for public use, and then individually granting permission to patrons. 2:a)  This only protects the public from charges for depositing waste. It does not protect them for charges for water, paper, soap and hand drying. This needs to be addressed. 2:b) I'd also predict that every local authority in the land will claim they cannot afford it and will claim the subsidy."
MHOC,3cl9b0,RomanCatholic,2,Thu Jul 9 11:59:19 2015 UTC,Paying a small toll to use the public toilet is not a bad thing as it can help to improve the standard of the toilets. Also I think if some businesses had to make them free then they wouldn't bother having toilets.
MHOC,3cl9b0,alexwagbo,2,Thu Jul 9 14:30:34 2015 UTC,"This is excellent. Having to go to the toilet in public should be easy, and the useless 30p charge they tend to have is unnecessary."
MHOC,3cl9b0,Panhead369,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:13:15 2015 UTC,"Mr. Speaker,  I do have the utmost respect and support for reforms that further communalize the provision of human needs. The spirit of this bill is good and its goal must be supported.  However, there are some gaps within the language of the bill and its execution that must be noted and reformed before this honorable institution can be expected to proceed.  Firstly, it is uncertain whether this bill would make only direct charges for usage of restrooms illegal, or if establishments may require other forms of payment before the restroom becomes available. For example, this bill may not necessarily ban establishments from requiring a purchase before they allow restrooms to become available. This may have fallen underneath the intent of the bill, but I would suggest that additional language be used to guard against this bill's possible neutering in future legal proceedings.  Secondly, the financing suggested in this bill has no funding and no formal organization. The language offers subsidies to struggling businesses, but it does not have a means of taxation or a source of funding. Without this, the government will entirely be borrowing to make this initiative a reality.  I am additionally concerned that there is no clarity regarding what this bill considers, ""only...that...which the local authorities cannot afford."" This implies a judgement on how much a local business or municipality can afford, but does not provide a source of that judgement. The possible addition of a small administration to make this judgement could help to resolve this issue. Regardless of the structure, I find it necessary to have a body determining the subsidization of businesses and municipalities as authorized by this bill.  In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my support for this initiative and would respectfully request that this constructive criticism be considered."

MHOC,3cl1lr,Mepzie,2,Wed Jul 8 21:46:50 2015 UTC,"2nd Reading Speech  Mr Speaker,  I submit the televised public events bill for its second reading in this house, proposing just a few minor amendments. Firstly the process of the expiration of current contracts is being dealt with for both categories of events and minor changes have also been made to Scotland's category A list.  I will deal first with the process I have put into place to deal with current contracts. It is of course illegal for a government to break a private contract between two companies and laws also cannot be applied retrospectively so the government has no power to ensure that the governing bodies of these events conform to this law during the period of the current contract. Instead each event will become a category a or b event on the expiration of its current contract, avoiding legal challenge from any parties involved. This will of course be different for every event and some events may not be protected until the next decade but legally this is the simplest and easiest option that will cause the least legal headache for the government and our lawyers.  Scotland's category a list has also been changed slightly. The initial proposal had old firm games included as football is the sole sport with any importance north of the border. However, as many honourable members and right honourable members of the house noted, this event has little to no importance outside of the former Strathclyde area and my proposal could have resulted in an increase in domestic violence. I have therefore replaced old firm matches with Scotland National rugby union matches and a pro12 final if Glasgow or Edinburgh are participating, creating ugly equality throughout  these islands.  /u/mg9500"
MHOC,3cl1lr,Tim-Sanchez,3,Wed Jul 8 19:07:23 2015 UTC,"I have therefore replaced old firm matches with Scotland National rugby union matches and a pro12 final if Glasgow or Edinburgh are participating   Why must they be replaced? I feel this bill already goes way too far in terms of forcing certain sports to be on freeview, I'm not sure why the removal of old firm matches warranted a replacement."

MHOC,3cl1lr,mg9500,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:26:53 2015 UTC,"Having just the minimum events is more unequal. No system is ideal, there is a reason for having more events in NI, as they all are important (GAA is primarily only played/watched by one community though)"
MHOC,3cl1lr,Tim-Sanchez,3,Wed Jul 8 19:45:05 2015 UTC,"What is the rabid obsession with equality anyway?   Having just the minimum events is more unequal.   This is how it should be. The events in Category A, events we are forcing to be on free-to-air television, should be reserved to the absolute minimum of most important sports. What you have done is compromise fairness in the name of equality. What would be fair would be having an equal and consistent method of selecting every sport (eg: based on importance), rather than changing the methods of selecting every sport (eg: inclusion of women's rugby, equal but not fair). I would prefer a fair and consistent method of selecting the sports used rather than methods used to try and preserve equality, which ultimately mean events are included that should not be."

I also think the bill gives the government far too much power, both in terms of deciding which sports are shown (which I believe should be done independently) and the power given to the Prime Minister over arbitrarily designating certain events as ""important"" enough to go on free-to-air channels.

While I accept that it is very difficult to get change at the ballot box I do believe that the democratic mechanisms of the state can gradually be used to advance humanity towards a better, freer future.  We can use the existing political process to provide the people with real and direct democracy by decentralising power and decreasing the size of that state. From Whitehall we can repeal laws that hold us trapped and create new local and free systems that work for the people.  I have a lot of respect for the high minded political activists who refuse to sully themselves with the corrupting influence of power and instead do vital work in communities and on the streets but I feel that by shunning power altogether the libertarians have lost many opportunities to make lasting change.  Let's use every means possible to improve the world and not abandon power to the right wingers and authoritarians. Let's work in the communities. Let's march on the streets.

Or is it more of a dilutional effect, we won't see the Nazi salute for the sheer number hands held up pledging allegiance to the flag?  I think rather than attempting to tackle fire with fire we should tackle extremist nationalism at the root, communities with little life prospects, desperately poor education and young masculine rage without a proper outlet.

We're not giving them 'special privilages' in the slightest, we're trying to give them just a little bit of justice for all the unfair carnage we caused to in years gone by - to not do so is to give ourselves a huge special privilage.  At any rate, the very idea of contraction and convergence is that all countries contract their emissions per capita either up (LEDCs below the average) or down (MEDCs above the average) to a certain universal point as shown on the graph I linked so that every human being on the planet effectively has the same right to emit the same quantity of carbon as the next and said quantity is reduced unilaterally - there is nothing that can be fairer than that."

They don't need to as fast because their emissions are just so much less than the developed world. They should be allowed to continue to use carbon based energy so as to develop their economy in the short term, so that in the future they can more easily switch over to more sustainable sources of energy.  India outputs 8.95% of the world's emissions, they should start reducing alongside the US, China and EU. However Pakistan is .48, Kenya, .04, Nigeria .23, 1.25, Indonesia 1.29. The US, EU and China account for 51% of all carbon emissions. If Kenya reduced its emissions to half, it wouldn't change anything. If we add India and Russia to that its 65%.

Where they've but used before, what happens is that countries like China and Russia purchase the carbon credits of poor countries such as Ethiopia. China and Russia therefore have no incentive to reduce their emissions and the less developed countries they've purchased the credits from are stuck being less developed as developing tends to be dirty.  If the groups are only allowed intra-group trading then this problem is mitigated substantially. I'm glad this treaty has taken that into account."
MHOC,3cewve,kevinWilson94,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:00:01 2015 UTC,"Finally, something that the RMUN can help ratify. This is a good day."
MHOC,3cewve,purpleslug,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:26:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you Prime Minister for presenting the treaty. As my colleague /u/Ajubbajub has said ""This treaty is a major step to achieve carbon decarbonisation."" I hope that this gets signed by as many nations as possible"
MHOC,3cewve,Jonster123,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:29:35 2015 UTC,"An excellent treaty. It's going to take time, but with international co-operation, we can reverse the damage that we have inflicted upon our planet. Remember: we are not just saving our planet - the way things are going, our planet isn't going to magically disintegrate. We're saving ourselves."
MHOC,3cewve,TheInfernalRain,2,Tue Jul 7 11:29:36 2015 UTC,"This is not international co-operation, this is completely unfair to developing nations."
MHOC,3cewve,SPQR1776,2,Tue Jul 7 20:06:53 2015 UTC,"It would appear that my initial positive reaction was not well thought out. You're right, the treaty is not an equal one by any means."
MHOC,3cewve,TheInfernalRain,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:07:59 2015 UTC,"Could it not be argued that, to reduce the effects of climate change, we must be unfair? the damage done already is irreperable. When the future of our survival is on the line, surely we must be slightly ruthless?"
MHOC,3cewve,I_miss_Chris_Hughton,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:34:41 2015 UTC,"This is certainly an issue of great importance, however we in the first world have resources to reduce our emissions with less effect upon our economies than a developing nation which is relying on carbon emissions to grow their economy. In addition we have more emissions than they do and so it is more important that we reduce ours. What should happen is that larger economies with higher carbon emissions should reduce their emissions first, which this treaty does not do."
MHOC,3cewve,SPQR1776,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:34:30 2015 UTC,Thank you Prime Minister for showing the House the treaty-finally the RMUN can do something
MHOC,3cb93o,Timanfya,8,Mon Jul 6 15:43:53 2015 UTC,Will this and all future bills be given assent by His Majesty King /u/Timanfya?
MHOC,3cb93o,UnderwoodF,9,Mon Jul 6 18:38:01 2015 UTC,*His Majesty Queen /u/Timanfya
MHOC,3cb93o,Jas1066,2,Mon Jul 6 18:44:16 2015 UTC,God save the Queen!
MHOC,3cb93o,da_drifter0912,5,Tue Jul 7 03:32:25 2015 UTC,Great bill that offers much needed protection to wealth creators.
MHOC,3cb93o,theyeatthepoo,3,Mon Jul 6 16:34:56 2015 UTC,Hear hear.
MHOC,3cb93o,MorganC1,5,Mon Jul 6 17:49:28 2015 UTC,This literally just changed my view of this bill from fairly positive to strongly negative.
MHOC,3cb93o,Jas1066,3,Mon Jul 6 16:45:51 2015 UTC,Why?
MHOC,3cb93o,theyeatthepoo,2,Mon Jul 6 16:46:26 2015 UTC,"Its not just those who are employed that generate wealth, and you saying so just implies that this bill has some kind of hidden meaning."
MHOC,3cb93o,Jas1066,9,Mon Jul 6 16:49:06 2015 UTC,I assure you there is no hidden agenda in this bill. For the vast majority of employers it will make little difference. For those employers involved in unethical practices it will bring them into line with the majority of employers.
MHOC,3cb93o,AlbertDock,2,Mon Jul 6 17:10:21 2015 UTC,"I thank you for your reassurance, but forgive me for not being completely onboard with you any more."
MHOC,3cb93o,Jas1066,5,Mon Jul 6 17:16:24 2015 UTC,Don't be so ridiculous. What's wrong with using the term 'wealth creators' ?   Your childish attempts to split the government are so see-through its embarrassing.
MHOC,3cb93o,theyeatthepoo,3,Mon Jul 6 17:39:33 2015 UTC,Hear hear.
MHOC,3cb93o,MorganC1,2,Mon Jul 6 17:49:54 2015 UTC,"Whut? Is the right honorable member high? Its not what you said, per say, its who said it."
MHOC,3cb93o,Jas1066,4,Mon Jul 6 18:04:41 2015 UTC,Well then you do yourself a disservice.
MHOC,3cb93o,theyeatthepoo,4,Mon Jul 6 18:21:23 2015 UTC,I'm sure how you got that from my comment.
MHOC,3cb93o,theyeatthepoo,2,Mon Jul 6 16:52:20 2015 UTC,And I'm not going to spend half an hour explaining to you.
MHOC,3cb93o,Jas1066,5,Mon Jul 6 16:53:06 2015 UTC,"onus is on you to explaing yourself if you want to be extremely petty, otherwise i guess we reserve the right to expand the jas stereotype"
MHOC,3cb93o,Cocktorpedo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:25:23 2015 UTC,Go ahead.
MHOC,3cb93o,Jas1066,5,Tue Jul 7 07:05:45 2015 UTC,I imagine it's perceived as an intentionally partisan word when there is no call for such language. I don't particularly care for the use either though not for the same reason as Jas.
MHOC,3cb93o,sZjLsFtA,3,Mon Jul 6 18:18:07 2015 UTC,There's no such thing as non-partisan language. What your really saying is that I shouldn't be challenging the right narrative because I might upset them.
MHOC,3cb93o,theyeatthepoo,5,Mon Jul 6 18:20:26 2015 UTC,"Some words and comments ring far more partisan than others it would appear. I don't think upsetting anyone for no reason other than 'agitating' (or rather I expect your own amusement) is helpful, useful or productive. Better to lead around the conflict than through and cause people to turn away. Conflict is necessary sometimes, not here."
MHOC,3cb93o,sZjLsFtA,3,Mon Jul 6 18:31:13 2015 UTC,Except that you've made a huge assumption about my intentions. This is a bill designed to protect workers and I see no reason why anybody could be offended by me calling workers 'wealth creators' and if they are offended why would we placate that?
MHOC,3cb93o,theyeatthepoo,4,Mon Jul 6 18:40:58 2015 UTC,"Its not a matter of offence, it's more like calling the terrorists in Olmyster's office freedom fighters."
MHOC,3cb93o,Jas1066,6,Mon Jul 6 18:48:49 2015 UTC,*3: Employment Tribunals. * a) There will be no fees for any employee submitting a claim to any employment tribunal.   Will this not just lead to a high amount of trivial claims?
MHOC,3cb93o,GeoSmith16,6,Mon Jul 6 17:07:44 2015 UTC,It takes a lot of time and effort and is emotionally distressing to make such claims. People won't do it just because they can.
MHOC,3cb93o,theyeatthepoo,7,Mon Jul 6 17:38:08 2015 UTC,I suspect some will if they stand to lose nothing.
MHOC,3cb93o,GeoSmith16,6,Mon Jul 6 17:44:04 2015 UTC,"And yet many will not submit claims if they stand to lose something, even if they are in the right. We must stand at the side of the worker to ensure they have ease-of-access so employment tribunals."
MHOC,3cb93o,MorganC1,3,Mon Jul 6 17:49:11 2015 UTC,"If they are in the right, how are they going to lose anything?"
MHOC,3cb93o,GeoSmith16,5,Mon Jul 6 17:53:00 2015 UTC,"It can cost £750 to put a case before a judge. This fee has to be paid up front. For many, particularly when they are claiming for money owed this is prohibitive.  While they are usually awarded costs they need the money to live on."
MHOC,3cb93o,AlbertDock,3,Mon Jul 6 18:02:36 2015 UTC,"These cases can be judged wrongly, you know."
MHOC,3cb93o,MorganC1,4,Mon Jul 6 19:03:59 2015 UTC,So then on a cost to benefit analysis is it better to have the trials free or be paid for?
MHOC,3cb93o,theyeatthepoo,4,Mon Jul 6 18:29:55 2015 UTC,"It's not free, it's payed by the government."
MHOC,3cb93o,GeoSmith16,3,Mon Jul 6 18:48:22 2015 UTC,For the individual I mean obviously. At the point of use.
MHOC,3cb93o,theyeatthepoo,7,Mon Jul 6 19:10:51 2015 UTC,Until a couple of years ago this was the case. It did not lead to masses of frivolous claims then and I see no reason why it should now.
MHOC,3cb93o,AlbertDock,3,Mon Jul 6 17:56:50 2015 UTC,I suspect there was still an increase however.
MHOC,3cb93o,GeoSmith16,6,Mon Jul 6 17:58:37 2015 UTC,Putting a case before a tribunal is quite complicated and few can do it without expert help. This has primarily come from unions and the Citizen's Advice Bureau. Neither of these have been willing to risk funds pursuing cases which they did not expect to win.
MHOC,3cb93o,AlbertDock,3,Mon Jul 6 18:08:38 2015 UTC,"With regard to section 1c, were there is no trade union representative is available could we offer the unions the opertunity to submit literature to be handed out to new employees when they start? Therefore ensuring they at least know of their options and what benefits there are to being a member of a trade union."
MHOC,3cb93o,Tsoski,2,Mon Jul 6 20:34:21 2015 UTC,Yes. That's a good idea.
MHOC,3cb93o,AlbertDock,2,Mon Jul 6 21:38:27 2015 UTC,"Opening Speech  I have extended to six months the qualifying period for unfair dismissal and have defined corporate clothing.  I have realised that under this law an employee could deliberately damage uniforms with impunity, this has been addressed.  /u/AlbertDock"
MHOC,3cb93o,highkingnm,2,Mon Jul 6 15:44:48 2015 UTC,"I have a qualm with S1:a. No worker should be able to go to their first day at work without prior knowledge of their employment details. By being in the workplace at the time of signing the contract, any vulnerable individuals may find themselves agreeing to conditions they otherwise might have refused given the time to consider it. The employee should be presented with the contract in advance. Whether the House should limit the final signing of the contract to be before or on the first day of work is up for debate, but the employee should be given details of their position in advance of entering the workplace in order to consider the contract in a neutral environment."
MHOC,3cb93o,AlbertDock,2,Mon Jul 6 19:35:35 2015 UTC,"At present some workers wait weeks before receiving their contract.  There are cases when work can be offered which starts immediately, or the following day. I do not want the contract to be an obstacle for anyone starting work."
MHOC,3cb93o,highkingnm,2,Mon Jul 6 20:26:29 2015 UTC,"I understand and see your point. My point is merely that the contract should be contemplated in a neutral environment. Even if only sent to the employee the day before, the employee should enter the workplace knowing what to expect. It is an improvement definitely, but there is no reason why the House should nto improve it further."
MHOC,3cb93o,AlbertDock,2,Mon Jul 6 21:23:20 2015 UTC,"What do you think to the idea of changing 1, a) to  "" All new workers will receive their contract of employment as soon as practicable, but in any case no later than the first day of working""."
MHOC,3cb93o,highkingnm,2,Mon Jul 6 21:35:53 2015 UTC,An agreeable change. That clears up my issue of companies withholding contracts such that employees are forced to consider in an non-neutral environment.
MHOC,3cb93o,thewriter1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:37:36 2015 UTC,"The Bill seems alright to me, only Section 1C worries me a little. Now, I am aware that unions are not supposed to do this, but it does seem that it would be a chance for them to strong-arm people into becoming members (mob mentality and all that). Why should a worker have to be introduced to the union rather than be given the opportunity to be introduced to the union?"
MHOC,3cb93o,AlbertDock,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:32:46 2015 UTC,"While it is possible that pressure could be put on an employee to join a union, giving someone ""the opportunity"" could be abused just the same. A manager could say ""I'm very busy right now, but if you really want to meet the union rep I could take you"". This would put pressure on the new employee not to bother.  I feel that a compulsory introduction is the better of the options."
MHOC,3cb93o,thewriter1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:25:17 2015 UTC,"But surely compulsory introduction would just lead said worker to 'Be Like Folk' (to use C.S. Lewis' turn of phrase) rather than doing it willingly. No one wants to be That Guy, especially on their first day."
MHOC,3cb93o,AlbertDock,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:17:27 2015 UTC,"As long as they understand their options, I see no problem. We are not dealing with children."

MHOC,3cbbt9,NoPyroNoParty,14,Mon Jul 6 16:05:13 2015 UTC,"Mr Speaker, can the deputy Prime Minister explain his parties poor voting record?"
MHOC,3cbbt9,HaveADream,2,Mon Jul 6 17:02:22 2015 UTC,"We have been getting quite sloppy with organizing the Block-voting of the party, however this is getting fixed."
MHOC,3cbbt9,OKELEUK,5,Mon Jul 6 18:38:11 2015 UTC,How?
MHOC,3cbbt9,HaveADream,2,Mon Jul 6 18:58:10 2015 UTC,Well we are going to put up strawpolls the moment first readings happen  this way MPs will have much more time voting
MHOC,3cbbt9,OKELEUK,2,Mon Jul 6 18:59:53 2015 UTC,Do you think that some of your MPs may intentionally not vote as a way of not voting against their beliefs without breaking the whip?
MHOC,3cbbt9,banter_lad_m8,9,Tue Jul 7 11:54:11 2015 UTC,At what point did you realise that creating irrelevant motions was not a good idea?

MHOC,3cbbt9,HaveADream,7,Mon Jul 6 21:03:35 2015 UTC,This is the third DPM's Questions session we've had this parliament and you're the third DPM that's been on. I understand completely that your predecessors may well have other commitments which meant they may not have been able to stay on but do you think you'll be here at the next DPMQs?
MHOC,3cbbt9,banter_lad_m8,4,Mon Jul 6 22:39:37 2015 UTC,Can the Deputy Prime Minister please name his predecessor's top 5 achievements as Communist leader?
MHOC,3cbbt9,Spudgunn,2,Mon Jul 6 18:04:14 2015 UTC,Listening to the wills of the party Being the most cooperative General Secretary Assuming the Secretaries of State of Defence and being the Deputy Prime minister up untill today Passing through much-needed reforms taking up the heavy role of being a General Secretary
MHOC,3cbbt9,OKELEUK,5,Mon Jul 6 18:35:37 2015 UTC,"I was looking for specific things, not vague things."
MHOC,3cbbt9,Spudgunn,2,Mon Jul 6 18:37:20 2015 UTC,....okay
MHOC,3cbbt9,OKELEUK,7,Mon Jul 6 18:53:13 2015 UTC,"This tells me he really didn't do anything, was barely active and you can't really put together any actual achievements of his."
MHOC,3cbbt9,Spudgunn,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:59:16 2015 UTC,"that's a lie, and you know it  He was extremely active, handled the party during the Public order motion crisis, was able to make sure the Communist Party retained its position, and more."
MHOC,3cbbt9,OKELEUK,6,Mon Jul 6 19:04:30 2015 UTC,"that's a lie, and you know it   Calm down there, if you said that in the real House of Commons you'd be asked to withdraw it.  There's a big difference between commenting on what my perception of something is than actually trying to willfully misrepresent and twist the facts. I'm doing the former not the latter.  If leading the party through the public order motion crisis was one of his finest moments, why didn't you include that in the list of achievements?"
MHOC,3cbbt9,Spudgunn,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:13:49 2015 UTC,"wait, so you willfully misrepresent and twist the facts? how nice, isen't that a sin in Parliament?"
MHOC,3cbbt9,OKELEUK,3,Mon Jul 6 19:17:52 2015 UTC,"Well, congratulations on messing with my mind there, I've swapped ""former"" and ""latter"" a few times now. Surely you know what I mean."

MHOC,3cbbt9,ThatThingInTheCorner,5,Tue Jul 7 18:37:44 2015 UTC,Congratulations on your new position. What will you do differently to /u/SolidBlues?
MHOC,3cbbt9,RomanCatholic,5,Mon Jul 6 17:36:48 2015 UTC,Can the Deputy Prime Minister confirm the rumours that the Communists are or will be holding and internal vote on their place in the coalition and whether they should pull out?
MHOC,3cbbt9,Padanub,6,Tue Jul 7 13:12:08 2015 UTC,"Congratulations to the fourth leader of the Communist party, this term, will he reveal what percentage of the party membership voted for him in the first round?"
MHOC,3cbbt9,RoryTime,2,Mon Jul 6 17:10:43 2015 UTC,"Well, i first would like to thank this rightfull and honourable member of the House, however, i couldn't possibly calculate the percentage of the membership. I will say that it was quite high though."
MHOC,3cbbt9,OKELEUK,9,Mon Jul 6 18:41:59 2015 UTC,"May I ask the right honourable member whether he got in excess of 100 first round votes? (Circa 33% of the membership) In addition may I ask him when the Communist Party will release full and comprehensive results  for their leadership election (incl. vote tallies), like most other parties do?"
MHOC,3cbbt9,RoryTime,6,Mon Jul 6 19:49:15 2015 UTC,"In their manifesto for the most recent election, the Deputy Prime Minister's party advocated for the abolition of the House of Lords and for the abolition of all noble privileges (one of which is sitting in the House of Lords). Can I ask why they (with their excessive and tiring talk of democracy) have now decided to accept seats in the second House, contrary to what they promised in their manifesto?"
MHOC,3cbbt9,bigpaddycool,2,Mon Jul 6 19:46:43 2015 UTC,"Because we are also in a Government in a House of Lords with a near Tory majority! Knowing this, it will be useless if the Lords are going to send every bill back to the House of Commons, because the Government has no majority in the House of Lords.  Besides, we can use the House of Lords, to disband the House of Lords."
MHOC,3cbbt9,OKELEUK,2,Tue Jul 7 05:27:25 2015 UTC,Do you not recognise the benefits of having an experienced upper house that isn't composed mainly of career politicians?
MHOC,3cbbt9,banter_lad_m8,2,Tue Jul 7 11:55:48 2015 UTC,Please wait for the Deputy PM to answer the question before responding!
MHOC,3cbbt9,banter_lad_m8,3,Mon Jul 6 22:52:46 2015 UTC,Does the Deputy Prime Minister see himself more as the continuation of SolidBlues' legacy or more like a different Communist leader with a fresh approach?
MHOC,3cbbt9,Jonster123,3,Mon Jul 6 23:00:48 2015 UTC,Today (Tuesday 7th) is the 10th anniversary of the 7/7 bombings. How do you intend to prevent such a thing not happening again Mr Deputy Prime Minister?
MHOC,3cbbt9,Djenial,2,Mon Jul 6 22:26:25 2015 UTC,"Mr Speaker,  Why am I talking to /u/OKELEUK and not /u/Solidblues? Please explain why another election was necessary?"
MHOC,3cbbt9,OKELEUK,2,Tue Jul 7 11:18:14 2015 UTC,"well to be honest, before the election we as a party agreed that the General Secretary out of the Election, in this case /u/Solidblues, would only be temporary allowing us to reform the Party.  /u/Solidblues opted a respectable decision not to stand, although he has been a great General Secretary."
MHOC,3cbbt9,AlbrechtVonRoon,4,Mon Jul 6 16:29:07 2015 UTC,"So, has there been an election for the Communist Party Leadership recently?"
MHOC,3cbbt9,OKELEUK,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:31:52 2015 UTC,"Well yes, i got elected as General Secretary"
MHOC,3cbbt9,AlbrechtVonRoon,5,Mon Jul 6 16:36:47 2015 UTC,"But were you elected directly as General Secretary, or indirectly? I don't recall there being a full election report."

MHOC,3cbbt9,OKELEUK,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:13:05 2015 UTC,"well we streamlined our party's ruling committee, our trade union, the OBU and Red Brigades, Recently voted for allowing lords, a better whipping system, and much more."

MHOC,3cb4qc,Zoto888,2,Mon Jul 6 15:09:27 2015 UTC,"Opening Speech  Mr Speaker,  This bill brings together reform in four areas of UK law to promote consistency and transparency in the broad areas of security and extradition.   To promote transparency in court proceedings, Section 1 of this bill disallows so-called ‘secret courts’, also known as Closed Material Procedures, in civil courts in the UK. Instead, all courts shall have to revert to the status quo ante (prior to 2013) of Public Interest Immunity (PII) applications, whereby the government may apply for evidence to be suppressed from the public if the court agrees this should occur. This, I feel, restores the balance between public oversight of decisions made by the judiciary, and the real need to ensure some evidence is not publicly available at that point in time. The current system results in the bizarre situation where a defendant can be accused of a crime without knowing themselves the exact nature of the accusations; this is instead kept behind closed doors and known only by the prosecution, the judge and the defendant’s special advocate. This is fundamentally inadequate – the defendant must know of what crime he is accused. Note, however, that this still allows for the use of CMDs in specific types of court, such as immigration tribunals.  For the benefit of the House, here is information on public interest immunity and ex parte wiley, which were the two conventions in use prior to the Justice and Security Act 2013.  Section 2 removes the ability of border patrol officers (whether constables or not) to confiscate travel documents without either making an arrest or being issued a warrant to effect the confiscation. Currently, ‘reasonable suspicion’ and the consent of a senior police officer only are required to confiscate travel documents. This is an absurd infringement on freedom of movement; if the state believes someone has committed or will commit a crime, then that person must be arrested and processed in the usual way. Confiscating travel documents unilaterally is totally inadequate and easily abused. The third section simply removes the Home Secretary’s ability to render an individual stateless. With the passage of this bill the Home Secretary cannot revoke UK citizenship unless that individual holds dual nationality. Again, this means that if somebody is suspected of criminal activity, they must be processed in the usual way instead of being subject to such an arbitrary measure.  The final section deals with extradition, and seeks to enact a single procedure by which UK citizens are extradited. The process described here is very similar to the one used for category 1 countries (in practice these are EU countries and those partaking in the EAW) and will also apply to category 2 countries (all others). In essence, this newer procedure removes the ability to ‘fast track’ extradition by allowing an automatic right of appeal, and ensures that the dual criminality test is applied to all extradition cases.  I thank you and look forward to the House’s debate of this bill."
MHOC,3cb4qc,Zoto888,3,Mon Jul 6 15:10:12 2015 UTC,"Mr. Speaker, unfortunately I simply cannot support this bill.  Quite frankly, in the interests of fairness, I believe that, if you visit another country, you should be fully aware of any legal differences, and the consequences.  While I would not support extradition to a country where an individual could face harm, as this would be at odds with decades upon decades of Conventions and Declarations on Human Rights, you simply cannot visit another country, break a law that we do not have here, and expect to get away with it.  Think about if the situation were reversed, somebody was to visit here and violate our laws on hate speech, or data protection law, or even our laws on marital rape or age of consent (after all, we have one of the highest age of consent in Europe), before returning to their home country.  Would we not ask for their extradition here?  It is for this reason that I believe that this bill supposes that the legal systems of the UK are in some way superior to those of any other country, and thus is ethnocentric in nature.  Hence, I urge a strong opposition to this bill."
MHOC,3cb4qc,HaveADream,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:29:00 2015 UTC,"I thank the Chancellor for his comments. His argument is as usual powerful.  To clarify, this:   (c) The dual criminality test must be applied for all charges and all requests.   Is applied by the court and is decided by the court. There need be no exact replica of the law; a similar law is adequate. For example, in countries where alcohol is illegal - but it is not in the UK - the charge would likely be equivalent to laws in this country prohibiting unlicensed sale of drugs, thus enabling the extradition to take place.  I do however take the point that this may encourage category 2 countries to change their stance toward extraditing individuals to the UK for crimes committed in the UK.   Perhaps it would be more sufficient to require that courts consider the charges outlined in the request with respect to the HRA (or wider ECHR, or even UNDHR) to ensure the most flagrantly absurd requests can be ignored.  For a second reading I have a compromise in mind."
MHOC,3cb4qc,thechattyshow,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:54:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, that performs the dual purpose of ensuring a protection of human rights, while also not providing a blanket legal immunity to many laws elsewhere that we do not have here."
MHOC,3cb4qc,AlmightyWibble,3,Mon Jul 6 16:00:46 2015 UTC,"Mr Speaker,  I, like so many in this House, support this bill. I feel as if this bill will support people from extreme laws of other countries, for example, breaking Sharia Law, perhaps accidently, in a middle Eastern country.  Look at it this way - you volenteer in a country to help the people, and the government doesn't like that and tries to extradict you from the UK, this bill will stop that from happening.  Of course, it'll have some downsides, breaking German law of Hate Speech or Nazism won't get you extradicted, despite the historical connitations, however, I doubt that this will damage foreign relations too much, and if I'm correct, this is already the case under EU law, so this law will only affect countries outside of the EU. Despite this, I believe that the benefits of this bill heavily outweigh the downsides.  This is a bill I support and I call on the house to support it, too."

You have made this subreddit that has given so much to so many and you've run it so successfully. You've been active and you've made decisions decisively, possibly the most important aspect of the role.   I think I've loved practically every minute of your reign, from the actual politics and debating, to just chats with you on Skype. I cannot imagine anyone doing a better job than what you have done, and you will be remembered in MHoC lore for many millenia to come.  As sad as I am to see you go, I do not blame you for wanting to leave for a second. I know you're busy and you have already given so much time (and money) to this simulation. Also, the fact that the speaker is blamed for everything makes the role seem extremely unattractive and we are so fortunate that you have stuck around this long.  Thank you /u/Timanfya for all that you've done, you've given me many hours of enjoyment, and, thanks to what you have put in place I (and many others) will continue to have many more hours of enjoyment."

It's just going to have to suffice to say that I could not be more grateful that you decided to set this up, this is, on the whole, a great, enjoyable, lovely community and it's thanks to you. It can't have been easy, I have only glimpsed the amount of time you've put into this and it's nonetheless immense. It's no surprise you need to stop. I'm sorry we didn't make this easier for you, though some of it is often entertaining, and it wouldn't be MHOC without any, there was a lot of unnecessary drama. And you better keep coming back (as I'm sure you will, given how much power you've been accruing for the Head Moderator :P), or you know one of the more interesting characters here will track you down :P.  I'll stop rambling now, and leave it at this. Thank you."

MHOC,3c7k73,Mepzie,5,Sun Jul 5 20:28:14 2015 UTC,"Ben,  When you snuck announcing the announcement into Tuesday's weekly update, I feared the worst and sadly the worst has come true. I have been here over nine months now and I think that proves the amount of enjoyment MHOC has brought me.   Obviously you have had lots of help over the past year or so, but without you, none of us would be here. I have met some good people through MHOC (and some not so good people). MHOC has helped with my debating skills, my workrate and most of all has gotten me seriously hooked on politics now.  I still don't know why I joined MHOC, the only thing I liked about politics was staying up late on election night to watch the results come in. You have changed that for me and I'll always be thankful.  There have been times where you have got things wrong, there have been times where you have annoyed me slightly but they are minuscule compared to the good things you have done for the community - I'm glad that you have been able to leave us when on your own terms and while we are in such a strong position right now.  So to sum up, thanks for everything! I look forward to the next speaker but I fear they will never be able to pull off your famous 'soon'.  Stick around and enjoy relaxing for a change,  Tyler"
MHOC,3c7k73,Crazyoc,10,Sun Jul 5 22:25:56 2015 UTC,"I've spent so long trying to convince you out of doing this I don't even know where to start.  Ben is nothing short of an wonderful person. It amazes me every time I see him that he's capable of putting so much undying effort into running this place despite having huge real life commitments, despite getting so little out of it, and despite all he has to put up with from nefarious members. It's a horrible job and it takes a special kind of person to do it all with a passion that never goes away and a smile that never fades.  Sure we've not always seen eye to eye, but I know that when you disagree with me you only do so because you want nothing other than the best for mhoc as in everything you do (or you're drunk...probably more likely :p). Over the last year you've stopped at nothing to ensure that we all have the best possible experience, even to the extent of giving up small fortunes of actual money and working late into the night with a level of benevolence that no other speaker could possibly ever come close to.  I'm not going to try and stop you going because I genuinely want you to - the very least you deserve is to get out of here while you still can - but it cannot be stated how much we'll miss having you as speaker. As someone to keep everything is order when it's all going against you, someone to turn to when we have a problem (anything from elections to maths homework), someone to trust and someone to laugh with. Without you and this wonderful place you've poured a year's worth of dedication into my life would not be the same, without a word of hyperbole.  I think everyone will join me in wishing you every bit of good in your future endeavours as you deserve and you stick around for a while yet.  As a speaker, as a colleague and as a friend, you've been the best anyone could wish for.  Thank you for everything.  God dammit now I'm crying"

MHOC,3c6zrr,UnderwoodF,4,Sun Jul 5 14:17:05 2015 UTC,"The taxation changes are a bit off on MHoC, and they were based on the old MHoC economy spreadsheet, but basically it relies around the fact that it taxes not-reinvested income at a rate far closer to income tax.  In MHoC, the revenue increase is only approximately £45 billion."
MHOC,3c6zrr,Baron_Benite,7,Sun Jul 5 14:19:36 2015 UTC,Rather nice budget if I do say so. Hope you all like loads of trains.
MHOC,3c6zrr,lorindushar,5,Sun Jul 5 15:34:51 2015 UTC,"I commend the chancellor on his extensive budget, and was particularly pleased with the environmental measures. I think the carbon tax is a good policy, as well as the new investment. I'd also like to see the carbon tax somehow extended to disincentivise methane, the second most abundant greenhouse gas.     Corporate Tax  I'm concerned that the steep changes of the corporate tax are overly radical. A 10% change could lead shareholders to not invest in companies to expand beyond the £40,000 level. I also think that this change will largely discourage investment. Although more profits might be reinvested, the transmission of initial capital towards firms will be very difficult. The first reason is that firms will offer less towards shareholders because the incentive for reinvestment is much higher. The second is that investors will lose even more money due to the tax being only on profits to shareholders/stakeholders. This means it will become more difficult to convince investors to invest in UK companies.   Sin Taxes  It is interesting that the government chooses to increase taxes on tobacco products. While I agree with the change, I would ask why they don't also choose to increase taxes on cannabis? Given that cannabis is a less addictive substance, higher taxes are more likely to decrease use. On the other hand, tobacco taxes are more likely to simply increase poverty and lead to individuals seeking their fix on the black market.   Child Benefit and Health Spending  A 20% increase in the child benefit seems to me irresponsible. We have a society that has an increasing population and still needs to bring in skilled workers while reducing our environmental impact and building the necessary housing. If the child benefit is increased, I suggest using some portion of the additional £600mn to increase the availability of contraceptives and education about the financial consequences of having children. Coming to health spending, I think that a 13% pay rise for nurses is absurd if it costs 43% of the health spending increase. That would put them ahead of the wage growth of pretty much every other public and private sector job. I'd suggest a more modest general staff increase, or the use of some of that money to invest in other parts of the NHS.   The Budget Surplus  I would remind the government that austerity is the same whether it comes from taxes or cuts. It feels strange to say, but the government budget surplus seems a little radical. When you consider interest payments as well as the £5.4bn increase in the foreign budget, this means a very large drag on the economy from the government, more than any of the previous ""austerity"" governments have proposed. This seems like a political move by the government to outflank the right, which isn't supported by sound policy.  When you're a Tory and the Socialist austerity program is too radical"
MHOC,3c6zrr,NoPyroNoParty,4,Sun Jul 5 15:37:50 2015 UTC,". A 10% change could lead shareholders to not invest in companies to expand beyond the £40,000 level   This is intentional, as part of the government's small business revolution.  We believe that it is best to reward small business, but not penalise larger businesses.  On a serious note, the overall taxation rate is likely to average somewhere around 22.5% on the largest of businesses, which make up a large minority.  If the investors are concerned about the 45% rate of tax, then they should be aware that this is lower than the income tax rate for the same income, which many countries tax investors at.   I would ask why they don't also choose to increase taxes on cannabis   The rates on the drug tax shall be announced shortly, but rest assured that cannabis has not escaped.   We have a society that has an increasing population    Yes, but we have a society that has the population of over 65s growing faster than the overall population, which will lead to a demographic crisis.  Beyond this, the increase in child benefit is intended to drag some of the several million children living in poverty in the UK out of poverty and into a more secure life.  The questions on health spending should be directed to /u/DrNyan/   austerity is the same whether it comes from taxes or cuts   Under this budget, we have increased spending also, however.  Austerity is merely a process of exclusive or excessive, cuts or tax increases without a corresponding rise in spending or tax cuts.  With this budget, we have increased spending to those with a higher marginal propensity to consume, as well as higher marginal utility of consumption.  There is a larger fiscal multiplier from our spending changes here than any tax cut on the top rate of income tax could have done."
MHOC,3c6zrr,lorindushar,2,Sun Jul 5 15:52:21 2015 UTC,"With this budget, we have increased spending to those with a higher marginal propensity to consume, as well as higher marginal utility of consumption. There is a larger fiscal multiplier from our spending changes here than any tax cut on the top rate of income tax could have done.   I think the theory of greater consumption at lower levels is sometimes overstated. IMF research suggests a very small correlation between inequality and wealth, and an insignificant correlation between inequality and redistribution.   While in the long term your policies might cause structural changes in the economy, you can't count on that for short-term growth - the budget balance is much more significant.   Secondly, you have to take into account the greater amount of offset consumption and decreased investment. Wealthy people still invest, which just has a lesser effect than consumption because it doesn't necessarily cause an increase in actual output, but has a role nonetheless.   I'd also argue the entire investment -> consumption change under this budget is offset by the pension tax. This takes more money from people initially and gives it back after investment long term. While that might be financially sound in the long term, we risk getting caught in a growth trap if it has a bad effect on growth initially and jeopardises the recovery."

MHOC,3c6zrr,theyeatthepoo,6,Sun Jul 5 23:51:42 2015 UTC,"Mr. Speaker, I commend the Right Honourable gentlemen for finally bringing forth the budget and for creating such a thorough document, though I echo the concerns of my Right Honourable friends /u/JamMan35 and /u/Jas1066.  My main concerns would be the increase in welfare spending, and the fact that the air passenger duty has been abolished. It would seem to me that this eliminates a source of revenue and I question the logic of losing 3.4 billion pounds in exchange for 0.45 percent growth."
MHOC,3c6zrr,IntellectualPolitics,5,Sun Jul 5 16:37:52 2015 UTC,Well done!
MHOC,3c6zrr,theyeatthepoo,3,Sun Jul 5 13:32:28 2015 UTC,So apparently removing air passenger duty will grow the economy.... which will be completely negated by the carbon tax.
MHOC,3c6zrr,TheQuipton,5,Sun Jul 5 14:13:18 2015 UTC,"Air passenger duty is a tax on passengers, not a tax on flights.  For any flight over 2000 miles in anything other than economy class, one can expect to pay £142 in tax alone on the ticket price.  This acts as a strong disincentive to fly.  Also the idea that a carbon tax would have a strong enough negative effect on growth to completely negate the growth is ludicrous.  British Columbia, for example, has continually outpaced the growth of the Canadian average, and suffered no loss in growth from the introduction of the carbon tax.  This is also true of Ireland, Finland, and Sweden, all of which have carbon taxes, and none of which have suffered direct economic consequences as a result."
MHOC,3c6zrr,lorindushar,5,Sun Jul 5 14:25:53 2015 UTC,"This acts as a strong disincentive to fly.   Ah darn it, we're disincentivising killing the planet. Nightmare.  (ok fine air passenger duty is ineffective and carbon taxes are great but the principle is important)"

MHOC,3c6zrr,Jonster123,10,Mon Jul 6 13:57:41 2015 UTC,"Mr Speaker, this is an occasion the significance of which cannot be underestimated. When the left swept into power some months ago we knew that one way or another the dark age of neo-liberalism was coming to an end. However it is this moment that marks the final nail in the coffin of a failed experiment that ruined so many lives and set us back decades.   The first waves of change came in the election of the Labour/Liberal coalition back in September, but that Government simply didn't have the ability to push through progressive change and fell apart. Then came a big set back. The formation of a Conservative led government that stopped progress in its tracks.   Now we have come to that precious point that so many have dreamt off since the destruction of social democracy from the late 1970's onwards.   This budget delivers social services, greater equality and economic prosperity for all. It shows that the state and its apparatus can be used to make the society we want to live in. It is a fantastic step forward and all credit goes to the chancellor /u/Zoto888 for making it happen.  Hopefully this reinvigorates the left in this house and before the next election we achieve those goals that we pledged we would achieve. Nationalisation, equality, common ownership, co-operatives and a government led by the needs of the people seeking to build a society that delivers what the people need."

I understand that, but millions of shoppers doing their weekly shop and then seeing their total at the till up by a large amount is not good at all, it's going to scare a lot of people, especially since many people won't see the positive effects of the budget for a while, some might not even feel any positive effect on their wallet, but they'll feel a negative effect everytime they go shopping.    here was no need to mention it in the budget.   but it's not in the pie chart correct?

MHOC,3c6zrr,wwesmudge,2,Sun Jul 5 15:56:54 2015 UTC,"but the VAT rise will equate to about £10 increase on a weekly grocery shop.

MHOC,3c6zrr,wwesmudge,2,Sun Jul 5 16:12:17 2015 UTC,so low income families are exempt from the VAT increase?
MHOC,3c6zrr,thedexer102,5,Sun Jul 5 16:18:36 2015 UTC,"No, but low-income families purchase fewer goods, which means they pay less VAT, although it's a larger proportion of their income.  Anyway, anyone earning less than £210,000 will get more from the Citizen's Dividend than they lose to VAT."
MHOC,3c6zrr,wwesmudge,2,Sun Jul 5 16:20:24 2015 UTC,"low income families still have to pay £150 a week on groceries, food is food and it's still an increase. I understand your point about the Citizen's Dividend."

MHOC,3c6zrr,WineRedPsy,2,Mon Jul 6 09:37:14 2015 UTC,"ohhh that's what you meant by element. Sorry no I meant as in carbon dioxide is a large component of air, which is one of the four natural elements (fire, water, earth and air). I apologise for the confusion that was my bad.   Hang on though, your government told me before that it wasn't a tax on carbon dioxide emissions, it was a tax on the carbon content of fuel. So which is it?"
MHOC,3c6zrr,NoPyroNoParty,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:25:06 2015 UTC,Yes. I understand what your getting at now. Hopefully the confusion can be avoided in the future.   I believe the rate is calculated using the CO2 emitted per litre of fuel. Each fuel has a different capacity and factors like Cat Converters also need to be taken into account. The calculation is based on carbon content but the effect is to tax emission's I believe. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
MHOC,3c6zrr,WineRedPsy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:49:57 2015 UTC,Sounds like the government is on the same page about the Carbon Tax then! /s
MHOC,3c6zrr,NoPyroNoParty,4,Mon Jul 6 11:10:34 2015 UTC,"OK, lets write an overly long, uniformed piece just to waste my own and the chancellor's time:    Income Tax:  A bit of a weird tax. On one side of the argument you could say that if tobacco tax stops people from smoking, income tax stops people from earning, but on the other, it is only fair that if it is the people who are going to reap the benefits of education and the NHS, they should be the ones paying for it.   But I'm sure we all know this already, so my thoughts on the changes made: Not too radical, but I do think it is fundamentally wrong for somebody who is obviously highly skilled to be giving over half of their income to the government. More over, a 10% tax rise does seem a bit excessive.  Corp. Tax  I must say, the overhaul of this is certainly interesting. I will express some concerns about foreign investment drying up with these changes, but I do confess, I am not completely in the know.  Other  I oppose the Air Passenger Duty abolition. Air travel is obviously bad for the environment, and I dare say that this money helped pay for any health implications of this in the NHS. Also, I would dispute the impartiality of easyjet...  Again, I find a 25% tax rise is a bit of a sharp change, for VAT, and would suggest it would cost the average person a fair bit more than £520 pounds per year, but I don't have anything to support these claims  The married couple's tax is sad but not the most important thing going on here.  Child Benefits  This country already has  people  living of child benefits. They do not need to be increased, without limiting the number of kids you can have and still qualify.   Unemployed Pay  I don't understand the rebranding of jobseeker's allowance. I mean, it sounds like you are trying to demonise those not in work, and while some may think that this is a good thing, personally I don't.  You also didn't specify which minimum wage you would be using as a reference. I also think that if you do up the minimum wage to something ridiculous like £10/hour, you would have an exceptionally high ""unemployed Pay"".    I shall return later and add the other sections."
MHOC,3c6zrr,WineRedPsy,9,Sun Jul 5 15:05:41 2015 UTC,"a 10% tax rise does seem a bit excessive   The largest rise in taxation was 8%.     I do think it is fundamentally wrong for somebody who is obviously highly skilled to be giving over half of their income to the government   Since we have no payroll tax in MHoC such as national insurance, it is best to consider the higher rate of income tax as approximately 43%, and the additional rate of tax at somewhere around 55%.  This means that these are fairly par for the course tax rates compared to other European nations, a bit lower, in fact.  Furthermore, one does not pay more than half of one's income until one is earning around £210,000, by the nature of income tax being progressive.  This is a very small proportion of the population, less than 0.65%.   Again, I find a 25% tax rise is a bit of a sharp change, for VAT, and would suggest it would cost the average person a fair bit more than £520 pounds per year, but I don't have anything to support these claims   The 2.5% rise cost £540 to a family, so I extrapolated from that.  Also, it funds the Citizen's Dividend, which means that it is highly progressive in nature, as you would notice in the Distributional Analysis."

Despite the act clearly setting out what can and cannot be released in response to a freedom of information request, section 53 allowed ministers to veto the release of documents on a whim, as long as they presented a certificate to the Commissioner, and the House. This bill repeals section 53, thus removing the rarely-used power of ministers to veto the release of information held by public authorities.

MHOC,3c4qic,Cocktorpedo,3,Sun Jul 5 01:58:59 2015 UTC,Potentially any. The whole point of a ministerial veto is to allow a judgement to be made as to whether the release of the information would be detrimental to the national security or public wellbeing. It's very strength is is that it does not need to be limited through codification.
MHOC,3c4qic,OctogenarianSandwich,3,Sun Jul 5 07:20:25 2015 UTC,"Part 2 of the Freedom of Information Act sets out a wide range of exempt information, and acts like the Official Secrets Act strengthen that."

Alternatively, you have have potential diplomatic incidents resulting from cock ups, such as serving the wrong thing to foreign ambassadors. Embarrassing? Most likely. Damaging for the country?

MHOC,3c3zdl,electric-blue,3,Sat Jul 4 19:33:24 2015 UTC,"At long, long last the Educational Secretary has finally passed education legislation. Congratulations on the passing of your first, and hopefully last education bill."
MHOC,3c3zdl,CosmicWes,3,Sun Jul 5 09:55:07 2015 UTC,"Mr Speaker, I believe the passing of this bill marks an important milestone for the rehabilitation of Education in this country. With this bill passed through the house the UK can start again to build state schools around the country when and where they are needed.   Today we take a step forward towards the full disestablishment of the academy system. We can be proud that we have significantly pulled apart a system that tried to introduce predatory market logic into the class room. A system that tried to take away regulatory protections from our children has been stopped in its tracks. State Education is being put back on its feet by a Government that is proud to support the ideals of Comprehensive Education; Equality, Fraternity & Laicite.   We can move forward now. A bill will be put before the house this Thursday to reform the exam system, an executive order will be made to protect children in schools across the country and a regulatory bill to ensure equal opportunity in non-LEA schools is nearing completion.  Further progress is being made, this is just the beginning."
MHOC,3c3zdl,theyeatthepoo,6,Sun Jul 5 12:46:48 2015 UTC,"an executive order will be made to protect children   Very vague, and given the history of the house rejecting your ideas, I demand that you put this before the house to be voted on."
MHOC,3c3zdl,Duncs11,8,Sat Jul 4 23:43:06 2015 UTC,"TheyEatThePoo, you are the heart beat of the house, you truly never give up. When everybody else in the house called you a failure and called on you to resign, you didn't crumble, you simply shook off all the criticism like it wasn't even there. You are a man without give, a man who would not compromise to save even his own mother.  Your response to constructive criticism is rock like in the way you act like its not even there, quite honestly you are my hero. Never give up TETP"
MHOC,3c3zdl,MrEugeneKrabs,3,Sun Jul 5 07:58:14 2015 UTC,"hats off to you SoS, you finally passed a bill. You've shown perseverance that can only be admired and congratulated."

Religion in schools is not the bible-banging creation-forcing terrorist-radicalising homophobe-creating paedophile-attracting hotspot it's believed to be. There's absolutely nothing wrong with a religious organisation helping to run a school; they're normally excellent, and the values they promote are decent."

MHOC,3c3zdl,InfernoPlato,5,Sun Jul 5 00:11:45 2015 UTC,"Of course pupils should study what different religions have to say on issues of morality. But schools and religion, just like the state and religion, must be separated."

MHOC,3c3zdl,sZjLsFtA,2,Sun Jul 5 00:19:13 2015 UTC,That's not an ideology and nor are those issues connected to secularism at all.
MHOC,3c3zdl,theyeatthepoo,3,Sun Jul 5 10:37:14 2015 UTC,"Perpetuates capitalist ideology etc. Not that religious schools don't have these, it's just a massive falsehood that just because God isn't mentioned, there are no ideological facets to the education system.  In fact education definitely should try to instill values, 'ideology' if you will. Socialisation should be one of the primary goals. All systems do it explicitly or implicitly."
MHOC,3c3zdl,sZjLsFtA,6,Sun Jul 5 11:21:25 2015 UTC,"I congratulate the Education Secretary on finally passing a piece of legslation finally. However, before he attemps to play this as a win for socialism or some load of rubbish.  It should be pointed out, this piece of legislation was actually very minor and very much a compromise, and giving LEAs more power to choose schools is actually something that both the LibDems and the Opposition want to do (but do in a different way, due to the way he is using this to get rid of academies).  So yes, this is a victory for the education secretary, but not a big one, and should not hid the fact his own genuine and controversial reforms have still failed."

MHOC,3c3zdl,demon4372,3,Sat Jul 4 18:05:09 2015 UTC,"No. Because of TETP's other actions, now only LEA schools can be opened. We support academy and free schools. The Opposition policy was to get rid of the legislation forcing schools to be academies enacted by the irl Tory-LD coalition (so either LEAs or Academies could be opened); however it's not opposition policy to force schools to be LEAs - we would have supported the legislation if he lifted his ban on academies and free schools."
MHOC,3c3zdl,treeman1221,2,Sat Jul 4 18:06:17 2015 UTC,"now only LEA schools can be opened   We've been through this, that's not an accurate term. The words the Rt Hon member is looking for are maintained schools.  More importantly, the point would also seem to be inaccurate. The Education Secretary's statement does not indicate that traditional academies can't still be set up, and obviously independent schools could still be established. And, an important point for the Opposition and their academy fetish, the statement also gave no indication that maintained schools could not still convert to academies."
MHOC,3c3zdl,athanaton,2,Sat Jul 4 18:32:01 2015 UTC,Au contraire. I objected to the education secretary's brazen railroading of an aye vote in this matter. He is playing politics for dubious ideological ends.
MHOC,3c3zdl,bnzss,4,Sun Jul 5 11:31:38 2015 UTC,"Why does that matter when deciding how to vote on an issue? Obviously it's an attitude to be expected from demon and other less mature LDs, but I'm shocked it's seized the entire Parliamentary Party (barring remiel)."
MHOC,3c3zdl,athanaton,4,Sat Jul 4 21:41:43 2015 UTC,"Of course it matters. That bill could not have been judged in isolation. The fact was that the education secretary has stopped the building of any new schools, and this bill was necessary to start it again. It is a matter of principle that I will not have the executive in this country hold the legislature to ransom in this way, therefore I voted against the bill."
MHOC,3c3zdl,bnzss,2,Sat Jul 4 23:28:47 2015 UTC,"any new schools   Any new 'free' schools. These are dangerous, reckless experiments on our children's education that even the centre left solidly oppose. It is no way surprising, drastic, radical or even especially controversial that this Government, or a far more moderate Government, would stop their expansion. Not close down existing ones, just stop new ones. And somehow the solution to all this is fight to keep a ludicrous ban on the construction of comprehensive schools?  This had nothing to do with opinion or principle for the Opposition, they simply decided that another defeat would force the Education Secretary to resign, and did their best to make it happen.   It is a matter of principle that I will not have the executive in this country hold the legislature to ransom in this way, therefore I voted against the bill.   Another exciting edition to the MHOC watchlist for hypocrisy. I look forward to how the Lib Dems will manage in any future Government with this kind of opinion about routine, standard use of power Ministers have been granted by Parliament."
MHOC,3c3zdl,athanaton,6,Sun Jul 5 10:14:49 2015 UTC,"I'm pleased the honourable member has developed the skill of mind reading. It fits well with his arrogance.   I've said before I do not care who the education secretary is. He's merely a mouthpiece for the government.   Your scaremongering over academies is unwarranted. The fact is that before this bill passed, no schools at all were being built, thanks only to the government's executive action. I do not enjoy being strongarmed into an aye vote."
MHOC,3c3zdl,bnzss,2,Sun Jul 5 10:37:19 2015 UTC,"I'm pleased the honourable member has developed the skill of mind reading. It fits well with his arrogance.   I regret to inform the Rt Honourable Member that the Opposition's machinations and manipulations are far from opaque to even those  paying little attention. And, indeed, are far from humble themselves.   Your scaremongering over academies is unwarranted.   I would ask the Rt Hon member to provide examples of me scaremongering. I believe I merely illustrated how absurdly over the top the Opposition's reaction to such a banal, though of course necessary, policy. Though I despise Academies as a whole, it is important to remember that the establishment of Traditional Academies and conversions to Academies have not at this time been changed by this Government. Only 'Free' Schools construction, the most recent and radical right wing experiment of the Academy family, are being halted. The claim 'no schools can be built' is an Opposition myth. And I still cannot fathom the logic behind the Opposition's position that perpetuating a surely indefensible ban on comprehensive school construction is a solution to this.   I do not enjoy being strongarmed into an aye vote.   If you would have voted Aye in absence of the supposed 'strongarming' anyway, surely you are not in fact being affected at all."
MHOC,3c3zdl,athanaton,2,Sun Jul 5 10:58:14 2015 UTC,"the establishment of Traditional Academies and conversions to Academies have not at this time been changed by this Government. Only 'Free' Schools construction, the most recent and radical right wing experiment of the Academy family, are being halted.   There is no legal difference between 'free schools' and 'academies.' New built academies are referred to as 'free schools' whilst converted schools are just called 'academies.'"
MHOC,3c3zdl,tyroncs,2,Sun Jul 5 11:14:35 2015 UTC,"There is no legal difference between 'free schools' and 'academies.'    Which is irrelevant because it was a statement from the Education Secretary, not legislation.   New built academies are referred to as 'free schools' whilst converted schools are just called 'academies.'   And as I said, the Education Secretary has given no indication that the Department will be blocking academy conversions. Hence, there can be new schools."

MHOC,3c3zdl,m1cha3lm,4,Sat Jul 4 22:17:39 2015 UTC,"With HS2, cities gaining more powers instead of regional assemblies, lower taxation encouraging local businesses in the North to develop... the Northern Powerhouse can become a reality under the Tories.  However, moving parliament to the North won't make it a powerhouse. It's inefficient, difficult to get to, and overall a waste of money better spent elsewhere."
MHOC,3c3zdl,InfernoPlato,3,Sat Jul 4 18:19:13 2015 UTC,"True, true. But can we move it somewhere that's not London? Would boost the economy due to a boost in jobs from parliament-related staff and stuff buying food... and stuff...  (Maybe. I'm clutching at straws. Birmingham's the next option... This is just to split up the amount of power London has (culture, economic, political) and spread the love!))"
MHOC,3c3zdl,m1cha3lm,3,Sat Jul 4 18:35:15 2015 UTC,"Would boost the economy due to a boost in jobs from parliament-related staff and stuff buying food... and stuff...   Ah, but that wouldn't be sustainable would it?  Think about it. We move parliament to the north. Yes it will probably boost the local economy (after the expenses of building it, moving all central government offices, ext). However, it will only be useful once all the expenses are accounted for. It will cost money to build a parliament and move things up north.  Now, how will the government get that money back...? It won't. The move north would not be profitable for the central government.  The local economy would get a boost. Unfortunately it wouldn't be a boost for the North, but a boost in a specific area. It also wouldn't last since parliament would soon move south again.  The move North would not be sustainable for the local economy. The money would leak out again.   True, true. But can we move it somewhere that's not London?   The argument made above is made for anywhere not London. If we move it to Cornwall, the cost of moving it would outweigh the benefits to the local economy since it wouldn't be sustainable as the jobs would move back to London once the move is over.   (Maybe. I'm clutching at straws. Birmingham's the next option... This is just to split up the amount of power London has (culture, economic, political) and spread the love!))   An option, I'll give. That's one of the reasons we want to give power to local governments instead of regional governments! Giving cities powers instead of regions ensures cities have freedom to grow economically. Giving cities city majors ensure that the cities grow politically. Giving cities funds to invest in cultural sites ensures it grows culturally!"
MHOC,3c3zdl,InfernoPlato,2,Sat Jul 4 18:43:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it doesn't make much sense to move it anywhere but somewhere else within London; all the machinery of government is in London, not to mention everyone else's embassies."

Now most if not all foreign owners are leaving their clubs in their droves and most international business interests are also pulling out due to tighter restrictions. Yes the Premier League was a money league governed by the rich and elite, yes it had corruption and fans didn't have much control, but it was also the greatest league in the world and now you have all money leaving the Premier League going elsewhere, and chaos awaits as many clubs across the country are plunged into administration overnight. Wages are not played so players leave, fans struggle to find solutions to buy or control the clubs and it is sheer chaos as the Premier League becomes about as successful as the Greek Premier. Congrats everybody!"
MHOC,3c3zdl,wwesmudge,4,Sun Jul 5 15:33:00 2015 UTC,Why so? The bill really doesn't have that much of an effect on foreign owners unless they're dodgy and deserve to be affected.  Darn democracy getting in the way of us ravaging the land for its every last neoliberal penny eh.
MHOC,3c3zdl,NoPyroNoParty,2,Sat Jul 4 16:00:28 2015 UTC,"Why so? Because that's what they would do. Owners and business use the Premier League because it has very little restriction that they can take advantage of. I know this isn't a good thing and the bill had good intentions, but the fact that most foreign owners and businesses have now left the Premier League has plunged the sport into a meltdown, like I said, the back pages this morning would've been about how many clubs are now in administration, kiss goodbye to the sport we all once loved."
MHOC,3c3zdl,wwesmudge,3,Sat Jul 4 21:42:26 2015 UTC,"But why? You've just repeated the same old rhetoric, you haven't given a single reason why they would do this. What part of the bill would make them leave? Why? I'm willing to accept any argument you have if you actually have any kind of reasoning to back it up, but you're just trotting out your own unjustified imagination.

MHOC,3c3zdl,wwesmudge,2,Sun Jul 5 09:02:38 2015 UTC,"no, but if you raise it by enough they will.   just as well this act isn't raising taxes to 75%. speaking of:   Also, you are aware that they did that in France and all the rich just emigrated right?   For one thing, the 75% supertax brought in pretty much dead on what it was predicted to bring in. For a second thing, the mass emigration didn't actually happen. Naturally the top rate was not very popular with the kind of people who would pay it, but then a) a left wing government is not going to be liked by those people anyway, b) we aren't supporting a 75% top rate at the moment (afaik), and c) the changes outlined in this bill are not drastic enough to be compared to a 75% rate of income tax. In fact it turns out that tax rate is not a very strong indicator of emigration."
MHOC,3c3zdl,Cocktorpedo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:29:39 2015 UTC,"Because they don't like restrictions, they like a free market to exploit. For the record, I don't support this, but it's the truth. Money leaves at the first sight of restriction. Look at the owner of Hull City who sold his club and all because he couldn't rename his club to ""Hull Tigers"". Now once again, I don't support that and the Bill had good intentions, but it's just the truth. Man.City's owners have left the club and are now in turmoil, Arsenal's consortium has left and the club is in turmoil, the Srivaddhanaprabha's have left Leicester and the club is now in turmoil, the Allam's have left Hull, the Yeungs have left Birmingham, Venky's have left Blackburn, Tan's left Cardiff, the Kuwaiti's have left Nottingham, Cellino's left Leeds. That's the reality of the situation, that is now happening because of this bill, did you not read the backpages of the paper today? The Premier League is about to collapse. That's the reality, welcome to the real world, now live it. Don't be so naive, you're infecting me with your ignorance."

If not believing huge assumptions with no evidence is ignorance then I don't know what to tell you.  Oh no they have to have the fans' permission to change a fundamental part of a club's heritage now, how can anyone possibly own a football club ever again!?  It's almost as if all the problems with football and the Premier League being 'about to collapse' is caused by the market being the freest, most exploitative and unsustainable of any market ever and this bill proposes a new model that has been proven to be fair and successful. Just maybe."
MHOC,3c3zdl,NoPyroNoParty,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:50:59 2015 UTC,"""Empty rhetoric"", mate you keep repeating yourself but you clearly don't understand what that actually means. I'm talking about how the real world works, and it's actually quite scary how out of touch with the real world you clearly are. I'm getting tired of repeating myself because it feels like I'm talking to a brick wall, but the amount of times foreigns owners have left their clubs or threatened to leave their clubs over tighter restrictions or FA/Football League involvement is very common. A huge bill like this, that wasn't even recognised by The FA, The Football League and UEFA, they are laughing their socks off and getting the hell out of there. I don't know if you're playing dumb or just not reading what I'm writing, but I supported the intentions of the bill (I swear I've had to saw this like 8 times, jeez). I've already admitted the Premier League is corrupt and exploited, are you seriously not reading my comments at all? I'm just giving you a reality check because you have no knowledge of the real world or the football economy whatsoever. This is a Model Subreddit I know but we need to have some touches of reality and it is now canon on this model that all the foreign owners I listed previously have now left their club under a quick sale. Because that's what's would happen. Ask Szymanski and Ross, Who? WHO? Szymanski and Ross, they're Sports Sociologists, just like me actually! They'd tell you everything you need to know, you should've been reading their work before making your bill. It's embarrassing how little you actually know about the football economy. So please, enjoy your bill passing, but let it be known, that it is now canon that the Premier League is about to come crashing down. I look forward to being part of the next Government that repeals this bill and breathes life back into the sport, it will be the first thing I do and it will be an absolute pleasure."

Now regardless of whether it's true or not because we could argue that until the cows come home, if your obsession with the free market makes you think that nefarious foreign owners are vital to the survival of the game of football, you sir do clearly not support the intentions of the bill.  Fortunately the rest of the house (including some from the opposition) have managed to see that a better alternative is possible and voted for progress over scaremongering."
MHOC,3c3zdl,NoPyroNoParty,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:18:24 2015 UTC,"I don't support dodgy owners. I hate guys like Oyston and Tan and the rest of them. I am actually part of the Supporters Trust that own the club I support, I spent £1000 on buying a share of the club and it was great. It's a fantastic idea and it's the way forward. What I'm saying is that by implementing a bill with all these new rules and restrictions, all these businessmen will want to leave, because they can't treat their clubs like a plaything. Now that of course is good, however the fallout of all these foreign owners and business investments leaving all at once puts clubs in scary positions where most will face administration. Fan ownership is a difficult, long process, I remember it took years for the fans to buy out the club I support, and we went into administration three times and were hours from liquidation in the process. Clubs don't just have years to find new owners, they run on debt and outside cash and without that, they're doomed. Do you understand what I'm saying?  I supported the intention of the bill, I support what you want to do, I support those changes, I just don't support the way to make those changes, because having all these foreign investors leave over night puts many many clubs in serious jeopardy. Go back and look what happens whenever a club owned by a foreign owner packs up and leaves without a new owner waiting in the wings."

As the budget will outline, an addition 31 trains will be provided to Wales as part of the Directly Operated Railways Rolling Stock Cascade and Investment Plan. Attached to this Wales will also see benefits from the electrification of the South Wales Main Line to Swansea via Cardiff (already committed and under-way) as well as the electrification of the valley lines (already committed and under-way). However by far the most exciting thing coming to Wales will be the reopening of the Traws Link Cymru as the project is called. This will provide a new line from Carmarthen to Aberystwyth  as well as then a link from there to Bangor on the North Wales Coast line allowing trains to run across Wales without heading into England. This will also link communities together which have been left without a rail link since the 60s and will no doubt be a treasure to the local and national economies of Wales."
MHOC,3c3y82,peter199,3,Sat Jul 4 17:01:07 2015 UTC,Infrastructure is without a doubt one of the biggest problems limiting rural business. What will the right honorable member do to minimise the effects of this in the future?
MHOC,3c3y82,Jas1066,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:33:02 2015 UTC,"Firstly I aim to deliver the modern rural rail services that many towns need to support their growth and local businesses. I also believe that while rail transport provision is important, we need rural communities to have good methods of interconnection in order for people to access more jobs and to open up new opportunities for consumers as well, that is why (with my Local Transport Act) I am happy to say that the provision of rural transport is improving and with the green bus fund this ensures that we can also improve the quality of these local links. However, infrastructure is a broad area as my honourable friend most likely knows which is why I suggest that he also asks the SoS for DEFRA and also most likely Business, Industry & Skills on how the roll out of rural broadband provision has gone as I believe this is an often overlooked part of rural infrastructure, and I hope my honourable friend would agree with me here."
MHOC,3c3y82,peter199,3,Sat Jul 4 16:50:42 2015 UTC,What is the SoS's opinion on the Airport Commissions report?
MHOC,3c3y82,GhoulishBulld0g,3,Sat Jul 4 16:10:32 2015 UTC,Obviously this will be a decision made not just by me however I am opposed to Heathrow as the site of an addition south eastern runway. I would rather we didn't build an additional runway in the south east and would rather opt for the more long term approach to eliminate domestic air travel and some short-haul European flights to replace them with High Speed Rail.
MHOC,3c3y82,peter199,3,Sat Jul 4 21:17:57 2015 UTC,The whole idea of the Airport Commissions report was to be a non-biased and non neutral way of deciding. Saying 'regardless I disagree' isn't a great attitude to have
MHOC,3c3y82,tyroncs,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:51:19 2015 UTC,I know and I have never doubted the merits of the Commission however I am personally opposed to any additional runways. It is of course not down to me and we shall have extensive discussions within the government on this subject. If I were to have to build a new south Eastern runway I would've though Gatwick is the better choice because it requires less capital to construct.
MHOC,3c3y82,peter199,2,Sun Jul 5 13:09:50 2015 UTC,"Ah ok I thought you meant you would block it regardless, sorry for the misunderstanding.  From what I can tell it may cost a lot more but it will enable Heathrow to become more of a hub airport, as we need an airport with 3 runways, not 2 airports with 2 runways each. I haven't read the report myself, but I am sure they took all things into account etc"
MHOC,3c3y82,tyroncs,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:32:44 2015 UTC,"I want to consult everyone I don't think it would be healthy for me to be the sole force against this. I would be happy to look at all options including a vote on the matter.   Yeah that was my understanding on the matter however while there are the obvious economic benefits of having a hub airport in the South east I hope the honourable member at least recognises my own concerns in regard to the environment if Heathrow is chosen, the report itself says that if Heathrow is chosen we won't meet the environmental targets set by Heathrow airport itself by 2025 which is of course of grave concern.   Looking at it from a land transport point of view I can see the merits of Heathrow especially if the western rail access is built however I feel that the potential Gatwick has being directly on Thameslink as well as having space to expand for better provision of GatEx services. Then again the underground link to Heathrow is quite valuable.  At the end of the day I imagine this is just the beginning of the long and complex debate I imagine we will have over this"
MHOC,3c3y82,peter199,2,Mon Jul 6 02:17:57 2015 UTC,But what about planes that are currently in development that use hydrogen (rocket fuel) instead of petroleum?
MHOC,3c3y82,Jonster123,3,Sun Jul 5 09:44:16 2015 UTC,Well of course they are in development and I would very much like to see that kind of technology rolled out across the industry however I still think that if domestic High Speed Rail is good enough we can free up significant capacity with the withdrawal of domestic flights which should really be unnecessary. As a trial on East Coast showed when they took over the franchise - if you incentivise people to take the train they will do so. If the incentives are a comfortable interior and a fast journey time I am confident that HSR will be a viable alternative to domestic air travel which will make it surplus to requirements.
MHOC,3c3y82,peter199,3,Sun Jul 5 12:04:54 2015 UTC,"Mr Speaker, will the Transport Secretary please inform the House whether he plans to construct a parallel line between Cornwall and Devon to prevent a repeat of events at Dawlish last year?"
MHOC,3c3y82,can_triforce,4,Sat Jul 4 17:30:31 2015 UTC,"I do have every intention to do so and as the house will be soon seeing considerable investments shall be being made into the region as a whole including in the construction of a new £400m 'Dawlish Avoiding Link' to provide security and peace of mind to residents who were cut off those months ago.  Overall the Great Western operational area will see a net increase of 40 trains including 15 brand new trains for the south west and 57 refurbished units (cascaded from the Thames Valley). This, when combined with the investment which will be announced into Cross Country as well as the existing investment into 83 new InterCity trains for the Great Western will create a stable rail link for the region which will be a catalyst for economic growth throughout the south west!"
MHOC,3c3y82,peter199,3,Sat Jul 4 21:13:07 2015 UTC,"Mr Speaker,   Does the right honourable gentleman, the secretary of state, have any plans to electrify the Great Western railway so that mine and many of my constituents' journeys in to London and other parts of the country along the route will hopefully be faster, more reliable and greener?"
MHOC,3c3y82,RachelChamberlain,7,Sat Jul 4 20:59:10 2015 UTC,I plan to continue to support the investment already being made into the Great Western Railway across the board supporting the total route modernisation which by 2019 will deliver 83 new InterCity trains across the Great Western Main Line. The new trains will electro-diesel allowing for the full extent of the electrification top be utilised reducing carbon emissions as well as allowing destinations off the wires to be served.
MHOC,3c3y82,peter199,3,Sat Jul 4 21:32:36 2015 UTC,Mr Speaker. Could the minister explain how he will improve public transport in rural areas which aren't served by railways? Could he also explain why rail fares are so complex?
MHOC,3c3y82,AlbertDock,2,Sat Jul 4 22:10:46 2015 UTC,"Firstly in my previous incarnations as SoS for Transport I took steps to re-regulate the bus industry with the Local Transport Act 2014 which did several key things but crucially it gave local people a say in the provision and planning of bus services and community transport and it also gave the Regional Transport Boards the powers to specify exactly where the bus operators must provide services. This means that local communities now have the chance to actually massively improve their services since the unregulated system didn't allow anywhere, outside London, to specify which services they want to run and at what frequency. Furthermore all transport boards will be eligible for funds from the green bus fund to purchase new vehicles to replace many of their older vehicles. I know that many rural bus operators get the aged cast offs from cities all too often, with this initiative I hope many more areas get access to modern, clean and comfortable buses soon!  Rail fares are rather complex however they are so because they have evolved over time to allow the passengers to get the best value for money. The advent of things like super advanced tickets, while further complicating the system, does actually provide significant value to the passenger. If we were to just go to a system where you just have single and return tickets it leaves many inequalities in the system - such as the peak and off peak issue as well and then the advanced discounted many people take advantage of. I accept this isn't really a perfect system however I would be weary about changing it and therefore taking away the many discounts people enjoy. I would however, be happy to accept people probably aren't very informed on the matter and I would like to see some kind of initiative taken my stations to display the range if different tickets available to everyone so both further people's understanding as well as increase the number of people who take advantage of the wide range of fares."
MHOC,3c3y82,peter199,2,Sun Jul 5 12:15:48 2015 UTC,What are the shortfalls in the plan to allow different companies to manage different carriages on a train?
MHOC,3c3y82,treeman1221,3,Sat Jul 4 16:17:45 2015 UTC,"Wow, I'm not really sure where exactly to start with this! Firstly you have the issue, who provides the staff for the train? On a traditional locomotive hauled rake of carriages this issue is less obvious because I assume you could treat it like the driver is a separate entity however that doesn't get you away from the guard - who will provide that?   Then you have the maintenance of trains, most trains aren't made up of separate carriages they're multiple units. And if you have one carriage of a unit operated by company X and the other carriage operated by company Y who will pay for the maintenance of the entire train? Will company Y only maintain their half or will they both? What if company X doesn't pay for their half and that half is the one with the traction motors? Will company Y have to fine them?   If there was one key thing about this though - no modern rail operator operates the practise you have described! So you have to ask, if its so good why don't others do it? And on that matter, that was asked - back in the 1990s when the Major government privatised the 'deeply inefficient British Rail' seemingly ignoring the fact that it was subsidised the least amount in all of western Europe but hey-ho! So anyway, this idea you describe was I believe floated by a civil servant who was then in effect laughed out of the room by officials within the DfT at the time!   If we're going to do what my honourable friend describes, I'll wait for some other countries like France, Germany, Ireland and Spain to do that first."
MHOC,3c3y82,peter199,2,Sat Jul 4 17:14:17 2015 UTC,"Mr. Speaker, what is the Right Honourable gentlemen's number one priority?"
MHOC,3c3y82,UnderwoodF,4,Sat Jul 4 16:18:29 2015 UTC,I would describe my number one priority as trying to deliver the most efficient and effective transport system for the people of the UK keeping it well invested in and maintained and yet at a good value to the taxpayer and fare payer.
MHOC,3c3y82,peter199,4,Sat Jul 4 17:02:18 2015 UTC,And a clean one too!
MHOC,3c3y82,NoPyroNoParty,3,Sun Jul 5 08:34:27 2015 UTC,"Indeed I would add that while initially more expensive, cleaner trains and buses are far cheaper to maintain and operate hence the move to electric traction on the railways."
MHOC,3c3y82,peter199,2,Sun Jul 5 13:07:31 2015 UTC,How would the SoS help to encourage the use of more efficient and environmentally friendly methods of transport?
MHOC,3c3y82,Delstein,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:51:16 2015 UTC,I think that a key way of encouraging the use of environmentally friends modes of transport is to improve the facilities available to passengers and then really sell them. In the 1970s and 1980s British Rail was very good at selling its new InterCity 125 to people as it offered things that cars did not and this worked as more people then went on to use the trains. So I think that better seating and saloons onboard trains and buses as well as free wifi is a key step towards this. Then making the transport more accessible in terms of both areas for wheelchair users as well as accessible in terms of the timings of buses and trains making sure they are at convenient times for people and times which are easy to remember (I think clock face timetabling is key in this respect).
MHOC,3c3y82,peter199,2,Sun Jul 5 13:17:21 2015 UTC,"Will the Transport Secretary start to revitalise the trains that run from Arriva?  I travel by train regularly and the trains are in a shoddy state; ripped chairs, paint scrapes, dirty floors...  something needs to be done about it."
MHOC,3c3y82,DELB_,2,Sun Jul 5 01:25:23 2015 UTC,Hear hear
MHOC,3c3y82,HaveADream,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:00:43 2015 UTC,A number of train services are currently run by Arriva however I assume you mean their Welsh operations which they actually apply their name to (unlike on Cross Country or Chiltern). In Wales all trains will be eligible to the £150m refurbishment fund which ignores the fact that Wales will receive 38 completely overhauled electric trains which will operate in the Valleys replacing the old rail buses and Class 150s which will be scrapped and refreshed respectively. I do have to say the more premium trains Arriva operates have been maintained to a high standard it is just a pity the do not apply this standard to their entire fleet. Hopefully through investment we are putting into the sector it will improve for you and the many other people who use Welsh Rail.
MHOC,3c3y82,peter199,2,Sun Jul 5 15:41:29 2015 UTC,Does the Minister have any plans to reduce the extremely long wait from the frequent train delays?
MHOC,3c3y82,IchLiebeLA,2,Sun Jul 5 09:08:19 2015 UTC,"Through our investment in infrastructure my good man! If we can modernise lines and stations there will be less of a chance that you are caught up in a delay however I would add that statistically speaking, most trains which are delayed are delayed by up to five minutes which while I understand could be bad for some is no where near as bad as it could be. With the better integration which comes from less fragmentation though it will actually operate a lot smoother."
MHOC,3c3y82,peter199,2,Mon Jul 6 02:04:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks, Mr Trains!"
MHOC,3c3y82,IchLiebeLA,2,Mon Jul 6 20:43:47 2015 UTC,How does the SoS intend to reform the Highways Agency? Currently the Agency is given a yearly budget that is taken away when the financial year ends (31st March) instead of encouraging the Agency to save for bigger projects.  So to repeat myself. How does the SoS intend to reform the Highways Agency?
MHOC,3c3y82,Jonster123,2,Sun Jul 5 09:51:16 2015 UTC,Significant powers in relation to the highways agency were outlined in the provisions of the Transport Funding and Departmental Restructuring Act 2015 with the Transport Boards taking more of a responsibility for road maintainence. I do support letting the HA keep any of its budget that is not used however I would prefer the investment capital be put into projects which do not keep a carbon heavy sector going we should be looking at a modal shift from road transport.
MHOC,3c3y82,peter199,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:29:07 2015 UTC,"What is the SoS opinion on the Bus Services. I understand that most Bus Companies are privately owned and don't particularly fall into your Remit (yet), but they make up a huge part of our road and transport infrastructure.  I've seen first-hand the complaints bus companies receive about their service, their cleanliness and their demeanor, surely something should be done before this vital piece of Infrastructure becomes an unhealthy shambles that starts damaging our Citizens."
MHOC,3c3y82,Padanub,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:32:02 2015 UTC,What is the minister's solution to the longer travel times due to traffic on motorways which has been caused by mass immigration?
MHOC,3c3y82,SeyStone,6,Sat Jul 4 17:37:54 2015 UTC,Your causation is wrong however I support a number of different methods in reducing traffic congestion mainly the improvement of the rail network making it even more attractive for people to let the train take the strain! Not only will that reduce journey times it will reduce carbon emissions!
MHOC,3c3y82,peter199,2,Sat Jul 4 21:34:18 2015 UTC,I thank the minister for his answer and let me say that I share his enthusiasm for the rail network.
MHOC,3c3y82,SeyStone,2,Sat Jul 4 23:02:08 2015 UTC,I'm very glad we have some common ground!
MHOC,3c3y82,peter199,2,Sun Jul 5 12:02:00 2015 UTC,"While I very much support the honourable member's rail initiatives, I also encourage the SoS to refrain from making uneducated assumptions.  http://www.rand.org/pubs/technical_reports/TR1187.html  This study shows that migrants do have a significant affect on public transportation. Regardless of whether this is good or bad (they provide extra revenue, for example) it is still a fact that must be taken into consideration."
MHOC,3c3y82,TheLegitimist,2,Sun Jul 5 00:43:17 2015 UTC,"Well yes of course when you're planning transport provision you take into account additional passengers who intend to use the services in the near future. However when planning an extra lane for a motorway or giving a rail line longer carriages you plan for all possible current and future passengers, it's not like migrants are specifically planned for. Furthermore I doubt that regular commuters will be particularly annoyed at the thought their line is getting longer trains or their local road is being given an extra lane. I've never seen in any plans to increase internal capacity on the class 319s for example or for the plans for the M8 motorway, have migrants explicitly been taken into account."
MHOC,3c3y82,peter199,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:01:14 2015 UTC,What do you intend to do to help make cycling cheaper and more accessible?
MHOC,3c3y82,bluebunglebee,3,Sat Jul 4 19:43:17 2015 UTC,"I intend to provide more funding to Transport Boards to allow them to use the money to improve local roads allowing more junctions to be made cycle friendly, more cycle routes through towns and cities as well as examine whether the London cycle hire scheme would be feasible in other cities."
MHOC,3c3stc,Timanfya,6,Sat Jul 4 14:25:30 2015 UTC,"A nice idea, but not really very practical. Maybe we should just set a tax on the ludicrous prices people pay to watch millionaires kick balls, and use this tax money to remove the need for food banks? I suppose that wouldn't be popular with the Conservatives though, letting charities help the poor and pushing along the rich is a Tory trademark."
MHOC,3c3stc,Djenial,4,Sat Jul 4 14:55:21 2015 UTC,"yes, lets raise football ticket prices, we already have the most expensive ticket prices in the world, but sure, let's raise them some more. Nothing like sticking to the rich millionaires by raising the prices of football games for the working classes."
MHOC,3c3stc,wwesmudge,4,Sat Jul 4 16:03:34 2015 UTC,"There's absolutely nothing wrong with charities and the government working in tandem. People can have involvement in helping others both through active choices and general taxation, neither is better or worse than the other in terms of helping people. This motion does nothing to stop the government giving out benefits or anything of the like."
MHOC,3c3stc,treeman1221,3,Sat Jul 4 16:21:08 2015 UTC,"You realize that taxing people watching football would be an incredibly unequal tax? Not all clubs are Chelsea or Arsenal, with large amounts of money both within the fan-base and on the pitch. Teams like my beloved Birmingham city, for example, have a dedicated working class fan-base who are, effectively, keeping the team alive. The team provides a crucial part of the cities cultural fabric, and the existence of the club keeps numerous small businesses in operation in a rather poor part of the city. And this is just one example out of dozens.   So, in conclusion, why would you want to take money from the hands of the working class and working class areas, I thought labour was the party of progressive taxation?"

What a horribly regressive tax that would be, and would hit some of the poorest aswell. Do you want to make football so no low income family can go? We should be working to lower football ticket prices, not raise them"
MHOC,3c3stc,demon4372,5,Sun Jul 5 13:08:19 2015 UTC,"Does anyone actually think this will work?  It is wasting £20,000 on trying to 'encourage a culture of giving in sport' but no Government mandated scheme will ever do that. The idea that people will bring cans of food to matches is nonsensical.   I must admit, I have never been to a football game   The author of this motion even admits that he has never went to a game himself, so it is impossible for him to realise how silly the whole idea is.  If people wanted to donate to food banks then they would. If they don't already then they won't just because there are some 'designated areas' around stadiums to do so."

The internet is a key part of the movement but it has a real role in society too. It attacks people based on race like saying all white people are privileged. It attacks people based on gender saying all men are rapists. It pushes for positive discrimination and special rights for those seen to be in a ""minority"". It's the sort of movement where false rape claims are celebrated and attacks on men or white people are normalised. They believe that by attacking people in the majority such as white men or christians, it somehow betters the cause for those in the minority. Put simply it's just a movement based on hate.

My concern however is that - as others have mentioned - I don't feel we should stipulate a single authorising body. Kosher is contested by the Rabbinical community with various groups within the wider big three groupings (Orthodox, Conservative, Reform) having differing views, I feel this is a religious matter that should be contested and decided by religious communities. Rather than have the single authorising body, I think it would be better to account for the multitude of opinions and bodies which deal with this and include a wider amount of information. K can still denote Kosher, but perhaps also include which body authorised it. It won't make any difference to those not of faith, but it will make a big difference for those who are allowing them to make an informed choice too.  Edit: As has been pointed out, B077 banned non-stun slaughter, this would effectively mean the entire market for UK produced Kosher meat would be gone. How does this bill apply to imported produce?

However, this stipulation for me is difficult. Firstly, while it is good that there are recognised bodies in this bill who define what is and is not kosher or halal, these are not the only bodies. Halal and kosher are not set in stone; there are interpretations of the religious texts which disallow, for instance, the methods approved by the Halal Food Authority as halal.  In the case of kosher foods, certifications are already available commercially, and in practice this means approved stockists can fill the niche of providing kosher food. The addition of the labelling provisions in this bill will not make this manner of certification any clearer, and in fact may muddy the waters and this bill clearly gives authority to a single monitoring organisation at the exclusion of others, which will result in the bizarre situation where approved kosher stockists are, according to this bill, not selling kosher food.  Perhaps the easiest way around this is simply to label all meat generally with the method of slaughter, from which religious organisations, licensing bodies, synagogues, mosques, imams, rabbis, etc, may advise muslims and jews the most appropriate methods of slaughter for their beliefs. This may also help to advise the non-jewish and non-muslim community about the manner of slaughter and therefore improve public awareness of some of the below-par conditions in which animals are kept and slaughtered.  For the House's benefit, these objections are some of the reasons for the lack of Lib Dem support for this bill."

Halal and kosher are not set in stone; there are interpretations of the religious texts which disallow, for instance, the methods approved by the Halal Food Authority as halal.   Yes, I am aware of that - but due to logistics we need to be able to select some way of labelling, and the organisations I have chosen to take the definitions from, are some of the largest current certifiers for halal and kosher meat.   In the case of kosher foods, certifications are already available[1] commercially, and in practice this means approved stockists can fill the niche of providing kosher food. The addition of the labelling provisions in this bill will not make this manner of certification any clearer, and in fact may muddy the waters and this bill clearly gives authority to a single monitoring organisation at the exclusion of others, which will result in the bizarre situation where approved kosher stockists are, according to this bill, not selling kosher food.   I am supportive of allowing other certifications, but it is worth noting that it is only those that wish to advertise how their meat was slaughtered, this bill will ensure that everybody knows what kind of meat they are eating. I believe that most of the current Kosher Stockists would also meet the standards this bill outlines.   Perhaps the easiest way around this is simply to label all meat generally with the method of slaughter, from which religious organisations, licensing bodies, synagogues, mosques, imams, rabbis, etc, may advise muslims and jews the most appropriate for their beliefs.

This bill simply mandates the inclusion of a symbol signifying that the meat is religiously slaughtered, and which type of religious slaughter was used.

It was designed to kill the animals as quickly as possible, and those who perform the killing do it with compassion in accordance with the word and law (If they don't, I don't see it as Kosher. And no one should.). It is also a falsehood that secular slaughter is painless. Obviously when done in ideal conditions its paonless, but I really don't think secular slaughterhouses are anything better. If the executioner does it without regard for the life they take, or with anger or enjoyment in their job it is worse than someone who takes a life with respect and compassion. Though, probably doesn't make much difference for the animal."

MHOC,3bz4gk,Cocktorpedo,2,Sat Jul 4 16:05:46 2015 UTC,I won't. I'm a hypocritical meat eater.

MHOC,3bz4gk,Cocktorpedo,2,Sat Jul 4 18:18:59 2015 UTC,I'm opposing your boring idea that halal (including pre-stun slaughter) is any more brutal or degrading than any other form of slaughter.
MHOC,3bz4gk,lorindushar,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:20:37 2015 UTC,The dailymail says otherwise.
MHOC,3bz4gk,Cocktorpedo,2,Sat Jul 4 18:28:45 2015 UTC,Such a reliable and unbiased source.
MHOC,3bz4gk,thewriter1,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:31:12 2015 UTC,"Actually, some places already label their meat as halal. It should not be too difficult to implement across the board. I see no problem here, really, as it benefits all groups. The jewish community (pardon any ignorance which may crop up. Tiny village living and all that) can easier discern what is kosher and the muslims what is halal."

MHOC,3bz4gk,TheInfernalRain,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:18:26 2015 UTC,"This bill is purely positive. It is important that customers know exactly what they are buying, especially so that those of religious minorities find it easier to find meat in accordance with their beliefs."
MHOC,3bz4gk,RomanCatholic,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:23:35 2015 UTC,I am all for this bill. It is unfair for ordinary British people to be eating Halaal meat when they have no idea it is halaal. It also helps for Moslems and people of other religions/personal beliefs so they can choose their meat and have all the necessary knowledge. A good bill which I support.
MHOC,3bz4gk,thewriter1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:03:11 2015 UTC,ordinary British people  ordinary   I think there is a little issue with phrasing.

MHOC,3bz4gk,Tim-Sanchez,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:28:48 2015 UTC,"Under ""ritually slaughtered meat"" you allow another language to be used as well as English, but surely in the original language the retailer would rather use something more descriptive than the term ""ritually slaughtered""? For example, if it was Kosher meat the term ""ritually slaughtered"" in Hebrew wouldn't make a lot of sense (I know Kosher has already been defined here, just an example).  Perhaps allow them to include another name in the text?"

MHOC,3bwwa2,InfernoPlato,2,Thu Jul 2 21:12:43 2015 UTC,I was forced to put Krabs on at the last minute. If three Opposition members had been planned in advance i would have had a tory.

MHOC,3bwwa2,InfernoPlato,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:23:26 2015 UTC,"Eh, you would have been better picking a Tory instead of Duncs if you weren't forced to pick him.   We're the largest party in Opposition and hold contrasting views on devolution and abortion. At the moment this QT seems to have only Krabs arguing a conservative position held by the Conservative Party in regards to abortion, and a nobody seems to hold a anti-devolution stance which could have been held by a tory member!  That would be fairer and more interesting. Keep that in mind before you overlook tory guests."

MHOC,3bx0xb,Timanfya,3,Thu Jul 2 21:15:02 2015 UTC,"Mr Speaker,   I am happy to present to the house the Second Reading of the Flexible Working Contracts Bill. I am also happy to be able to provide an opening speech with this reading, a poor use of timing by myself on the first reading.  This bill has two very clear purposes. Firstly, this bill seeks to outlaw Zero Hours Contracts, an employment practice that has plagued this country for far too long. This practice has taken away security and consistency from hundreds of thousands of workers in the United Kingdom who wish for it. Secondly, this bill seeks to recognise how Zero Hours Contracts did bring some clear advantages to many workers throughout the United Kingdom, and creates a new contract of employment in order to encompass these advantages. Flexible Working Contracts, a term ironically first used by a Conservative MP, seek to create a heavily regulated and secure form of flexible employment for workers who desire it. No longer will employees have to worry about exclusivity clauses or inconsistent hours from employers unless they wish to work under these conditions. Flexible Working Contracts, most importantly, aim to create a fair deal between employer and employee, allowing for more negotiation and space for movement on both the side of the employer and the employee.   Since the first reading of this bill, I have taken into account the advice of the house. One significant point mentioned was the reduction in workers rights which this bill would have inadvertently caused. I have included the rights which the previous bill neglected in this bill, ensuring that workers get a fair deal whatever contract they choose to work under. I have also added the ability to “mix and match” set hours with flexible hours, giving more negotiation room to both the employer and employee when working to create a fair solution for all parties. I would implore all members of the house to vote aye on this bill in order to give more security to this great nation's workforce and provide a better deal for those working on exploitative and unfair contracts.  /u/MorganC1, Secretary of State for Business, Industry and Skills."
MHOC,3bx0xb,MorganC1,2,Thu Jul 2 21:15:23 2015 UTC,"Mr Speaker, thank you for presenting this bill to the house in such hasty time. I will be happy to take this to the floor and discuss the merits of the bill."
MHOC,3bx0xb,AdamMc66,3,Thu Jul 2 22:45:01 2015 UTC,Could it at all be nice to just put it in Reddit Format?
MHOC,3bx0xb,highkingnm,3,Thu Jul 2 23:06:13 2015 UTC,My issue lies with A-III:S1. The practicality of the bill is compromised by the need to immediately move off of zero hour contracts. Despite my support for much of what is set forth in the main bill. There should be a short space of time prior to commencement employed to benefit both employer and employee in renegotiating a contract. Employees may wish to move to a Regular Working Contract instead of a Flexible Working Contract or negotiate pay under the new system. The time for these negotiations should be given accordingly.
MHOC,3bx0xb,MorganC1,3,Fri Jul 3 14:37:05 2015 UTC,"I have set the bill to come into commencement on the 1st September 2015, this time will hopefully allow for the points you have made to be addressed."
MHOC,3bx0xb,Ajubbajub,2,Fri Jul 3 17:34:25 2015 UTC,"I personally find this an odd bill. I would like to see a system where the employer can offer a flexicontract because the would give the employer breathing space where their demand is not consistent week to week. Obviously if the employer failed to give enough hours to the employee that week then they would have to still pay for the number of hours in the contract. Its a shame to see zero hours contracts be abolished. As a student I benefit from a zero hours contract because the I am able to take certain days off where I have better things to do and then not have to make the time up another day. I would like to see a clause where the employee can ask for a zero hours contract but the employer cannot offer one.  overall, I believe that employers should be able to offer flexicontacts, as they have the same rights as regular hours workers and employees should be able to ask for zero hours contracts."

MHOC,3br3oz,GhoulishBulld0g,13,Wed Jul 1 15:14:52 2015 UTC,"When your debt is nearly double your GDP. You need to cut back. Incompetent Government.   I think that this is a classic case of oversimplifying a complex problem to fit an ideological narrative. While I would agree with you that the Greek government has been massively irresponsible for a very long time I would have to disagree with you that slashing government ""down to size"" is the answer to all Greece's woes.   To give one example of a problem Greece has that wouldn't just be fixed by slashing is their problem with tax evasion. In recent years Greece has lost something like 86 billion dollars in tax revenue. If this problem was solved, then Greece would be able to collect much more money and may have been able to control their finances a little more in the first place.   It should also be noted that slashing government spending in the midst of economic recession is a very bad thing as it cuts investment even more in an economy that desperately needs it. This is part of the reason why we have seen such a dramatic drop in Greece's GDP over the past few years. The problem Greece has is that it has so much debt it's pretty much impossible to enact fiscal stimulus so it can't stimulate the economy that way, and it cannot enact monetary stimulus because it's part of the Eurozone which has only one central bank for every nation on the Euro.   So what should Greece do? Well it should probably leave the Euro and maybe just default on all it's debt. Otherwise it will just be stuck in an endless cycle of debt and economic depression that it will never be able to escape because of it's lack of fiscal or monetary tools."

No, it's true during all times. During recession, the supply of loanable funds falls and the crowding out effect still occurs. Furthermore, companies still need to replace their old capital during a recession and restricting that investment will damage their outputs even more. Besides which it is the post-recession period you need to worry. The private sector needs to start investing before the end of the recession on it will not start the accelerating period of growth. Relying purely on government spending is quick route to a stagnating economy.   I'm not sure how lowering government spending would lower prices unless it lowered inflation of some sort.   Lowering inflation would be the inverse of what happened. A lower inflation is still prices going up, just not as fast."
MHOC,3br3oz,OctogenarianSandwich,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:49:14 2015 UTC,"During recession, the supply of loanable funds falls and the crowding out effect still occurs   Loanable funds, meaning private sector investment? Why would the 'crowding out effect' (which doesn't exist) occur if the private sector wasn't investing less?   Companies don't just replace old capital during a recession if the demand isn't there. The demand isn't there if spending isn't there.   That's why it doesn't make any sense for the Government to dry up spending just as the rest of the economy is. Think about it.  A recession is occurring. People are spending less. So profits fall. So people get made unemployed. So people spend less. So profits fall. So people get made unemployed.   Your solution to that is for the Government to spend less as well? No. So the Government cuts. People get made unemployed or have less income. They spend less. Profits fall. People get made unemployed.  Or should the Government stop the cycle by putting money in peoples pockets and increasing demand?  It's not difficult."
MHOC,3br3oz,theyeatthepoo,4,Wed Jul 1 22:45:21 2015 UTC,"Clearly it is difficult because you're struggling to put together a remotely sensible argument. I don't expect you to have a PhD in economics, but maybe you should try to not be completely wrong.   Loanable funds, meaning private sector investment?    Not even slightly.    Companies don't just replace old capital during a recession if the demand isn't there.   Not even close. They may stop net investment, but gross investment to replace depreciating capital is a constant. If companies stop replacing capital you are beyond screwed.   That's why it doesn't make any sense for the Government to dry up spending just as the rest of the economy is. Think about it.   Oh wow, you are a true genius. If only someone had thought of this before. Fuck you Hayek, /u/theyeatthepoo has worked it all out.    A recession is occurring. People are spending less. So profits fall. So people get made unemployed. So people spend less. So profits fall. So people get made unemployed.   Or price levels fall, people begin to spend again, profits rise, being getting employed again. If you are responsible, government spending can be cut. Have you ever heard of balanced budget fiscal expansion? I doubt it from the rest of your posts, but that is what the IMF suggests the UK should aim for and that goes straight against excessive government spending.   Your solution to that is for the Government to spend less as well? No. So the Government cuts. People get made unemployed or have less income. They spend less. Profits fall. People get made unemployed.   No, the solution is to stop borrowing. Spend less than you tax and you'll be fine. Governments can't keep pulling money out of thin air and expect to get way with it and the best you can say about people who think that is they are naive."
MHOC,3br3oz,OctogenarianSandwich,9,Thu Jul 2 06:55:24 2015 UTC,Has Austerity worked in Greece?  Austerity in Greece has increased the debt to GDP ratio from 120% to 180%. It's wiped almost a quarter of the countries GDP and massively increased unemployment.  If that's austerity working you can stuff it.  The fact is that there are no examples of austerity ever working.  Look for example at America v UK post recession. America hardly cut and invested in its economy and we cut. 7 years on our deficit is 7% and there's is 3%.
MHOC,3br3oz,theyeatthepoo,4,Wed Jul 1 18:17:37 2015 UTC,Was the economy growing as well under Brown?
MHOC,3br3oz,GhoulishBulld0g,5,Wed Jul 1 19:01:22 2015 UTC,"During the global recession or before? How is that relevant? Why not compare rates of GDP growth to Blair instead?   If you look at developed economies post recession, the harsher the austerity the slower the recovery.   The best comparison to make is between the early coalition years in which austerity was imposed and the later years in which they headed the IMF warning and turned to investment. The difference is stark. When austerity was imposed the economy flat lined and failed to recover. When austerity was eased post 2012 and the government turned to investment the economy started to recover.   When has austerity ever worked? There are no examples."
MHOC,3br3oz,theyeatthepoo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:11:01 2015 UTC,"It was growing until the financial crisis happened.  Labour didn't cause it, Lehman Brothers and many other firms on Wall Street did by doing dodgy deals with house prices and lending out loans to people who couldn't pay the money back.    Might I also add that the Labour government under Brown saved people's savings by taking Northern Rock into nationalisation and is also why Labour had to increase the deficit to bail Northern Rock out.  Brown wasn't the best PM but I think he did well on that.  Before 2007 GDP was still stable but post-crash it was not.  Back onto the topic, austerity isn't working, I think the Greeks should vote no.  There isn't an easy way around this, there's two routes and they all lead to a bad path but I still think Greece should vote no because the IMF, EC and ECB are taking Greece for a ride -- it's got to stop."

MHOC,3br3oz,goodyguts,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:10:41 2015 UTC,There is no correlation between welfare and unemployment. Welfare doesn't have any impact on employment because people are motivated by more than just seeking out a basic form of subsistence. It's ridiculous to say so. We have almost full employment until the late 70's and when unemployment soared to 3 million after Thatcher came in that was not because she raised Welfare. The rise in unemployment in 2008 or 1929 was not because people suddenly got lazy. If you looks at rates of unemployment on a global scale after the recession the rate that unemployment went down had no correlation to rates of welfare.   What you need to do during a recession is put money in the pockets of people who will spend it and thus increase demand at a time when its sinking. The first thing that country's do during an economic down turn is to decrease interest rates. This is to encourage people to spend money. Increasing welfare does exactly the same thing whilst also helping people to get back into work.

MHOC,3br3oz,goodyguts,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:34:19 2015 UTC,Welfare actually has a positive effect on employment. Increasing welfare increases the ability of people to find full and proper employment and reduces underemployment and abuse of employment rights.

If I'm generous, I'd say perhaps you meant all the loans from European countries, which adds on another €141 billion. This leaves a total of €180 billion. To make a profit of more than €32 billion it would need to charge an interest rate of 5.6%. Unfortunately for your theory of predatory banks, the interest rate is less than half that. So let's move on to the next point.   What is more, the bailouts have come on the condition that the Greeks implement policies that have sunk their economy.   Rightly so. Why should other countries, who were also suffering the effects of the recession, give money to Greece to allow them to continue being wasteful? It would be madness to loan them the money and not ask for some actions on Greece's part to assure you they would be good for the repayments.   Another point is that the Greek economy got into trouble partly because they where unable to print heir own money as they where part of the Eurozone.   This demonstrates a complete lack of economic knowledge. Thank Christ you aren't the Chancellor. The reason they got into trouble was they had an imbalanced economy and were massively in debt, so when the recession hit, they were completely unable to respond adequately and were ruined by it. The Eurozone didn't force them to act irresponsibly, the Greek governments piggybacked on the stronger countries to get into so much debt in the first place. If anyone has a duty it's Greece. They need to pull their fingers out and stop damaging the rest of the Eurozone due to their incompetence.   The most important point however is that the Greek people didn't cause the Crisis, the financial sector did.    The Greek government caused the economy to be ruined the way it was. The Greek people voted for that, and they continue to vote for charlatan parties like Syriza. They made their bed and now they have to lie in it."
MHOC,3br3oz,OctogenarianSandwich,0,Wed Jul 1 19:16:06 2015 UTC,"The IMF has loaned Greece £32 billion and the rest of Greece's loans from Europe totals more than £320 billion. The interest on that is higher than the total of £32 billion loaned by the IMF.  In addition it is worth noting that the IMF has made £2.5 billion in profit from the Greek crises. So even with the default yesterday it has made a profit of £900 million on an effect interest rate of more than 3%.    Rightly so. Why should other countries, who were also suffering the effects of the recession, give money to Greece to allow them to continue being wasteful? It would be madness to loan them the money and not ask for some actions on Greece's part to assure you they would be good for the repayments.   Greece has been asked to go ahead with the action you talk about for more than 5 years. We can see the results now. The results are that we have to keep giving them money because there economy has not recovered due to austerity.   According to documents drawn up by the troika even if Greece signs up to the full package of tax and spending reforms demanded of it  'the country would face a level of debt that the IMF deems unsustainable' and that 'Greece needs substantial debt relief for a lasting economic recovery'.  That is the IMF saying that. Even the IMF disagrees with you.   We need to give Greece money to invest in its economy so that it's economy can recover. If we continue to ask Greece to cut and squeeze the poorest then its economy will not grow. That has already been shown by the last 5 years.    This demonstrates a complete lack of economic knowledge. Thank Christ you aren't the Chancellor. The reason they got into trouble was they had an imbalanced economy and were massively in debt, so when the recession hit, they were completely unable to respond adequately and were ruined by it. The Eurozone didn't force them to act irresponsibly, the Greek governments piggybacked on the stronger countries to get into so much debt in the first place. If anyone has a duty it's Greece. They need to pull their fingers out and stop damaging the rest of the Eurozone due to their incompetence.   Japan has a debt to GDP ratio of almost 200% and the cost of its debt has not grown. The reason it became a problem for Greece was because of its place in the EU.  At the time of the Crash Greece's debt to GDP ratio was around 90-100% (after 7 years of Austerity its not 160%). The reason that became a problem was because the economy crashed and even then they could have avoided disaster had they put money back into an economy in which private credit was drying up. Instead they where forced by the IMF et all to cut back spending further and now we see the result of that.  If Greece had been able to use quantitative easing to release credit into the economy then it would not have suffered but as it didn't have the normal monetary tools it its disposal the debt became a problem. This is why the ECB owes it to Greece to lend it at hand.  Also remember that Greece was one part of a wider European economy. It was a huge importer. That's what drove its economic growth before the economic crash. Who do you think was doing the exporting? Overwhelming its was Germany, and Germany's economy grew on the back of it.   Remember that. The Greek economy was part of a wider European and Global economy.    The Greek government caused the economy to be ruined the way it was. The Greek people voted for that, and they continue to vote for charlatan parties like Syriza. They made their bed and now they have to lie in it.   The Greek people didn't vote for Fraud, the didn't vote for what happened in their PRIVATE banking sectormand they didn't vote for the sub-prime mortgage crisis in Florida.

Even the IMF disagrees with you.   Oh yes, the IMF disagree with their own plan, how convenient. Let's ignore the fact that nobody believes you can fix an economy overnight and that a lot more work is still needed. ""The IMF don't think it will be an instant success"", clearly everyone should pack up and go home.   Japan has a debt to GDP ratio of almost 200%...Germany's economy grew on the back of it. Remember that. The Greek economy was part of a wider European and Global economy.   You have said nothing of value in that paragraph. You say a couple of facts and jump into your ideological conclusions without making any links. You aren't proving anything.   The Greek people didn't vote for Fraud, the didn't vote for what happened in their PRIVATE banking sectormand they didn't vote for the sub-prime mortgage crisis in Florida.    They voted for the government which was corrupt. They voted for the government which overspent, not the private banks, they aren't the problem, which you would know if your knowledge of economics wasn't limited to ""capitalism = bad"". They voted for the governments which were incapable of dealing with the crash. And most egregious of all, they voted for irresponsible financial polices when the going was still good. If they were less careless before 2008, they wouldn't be in this mess, but they are and now they have to suck it up.   Your economically, morally and politically illiterate.   That's a nice claim from someone who can't spell, doesn't understand even the most basic economic principles and gets upset when someone criticises their ideological rants. I guess the old saying is true. If you aren't a liberal at 25, you have no heart. If you aren't conservative at 35 you have no brain.

In the last quarter of 2005, participation in tax evasion reached an estimated 49% of the population , so as you can see the reality is the average Greek very much contributed to the financial situation, will you therefore retract your statement that claimed the financial sector caused it and also claimed the Greek people didn't?"

We've taken great steps to end the public subsidy of firearms licences; furthermore, we've submitted a bill to scrap police and crime commissioners, and strengthen the duty of the police to their local communities.  With regards to our pledge to reverse cuts, we've spoken to the Chancellor about reversing cuts to the police budget, and have plans to make great efficiency savings.

MHOC,3br4wk,AlbertDock,2,Wed Jul 1 16:18:34 2015 UTC,"Mr. Speaker, It is undoubtedly true that owls are a British symbol. They live in the one landscape we humans have not conquered yet: the night. Their nighttime shrieking is an omen of death to all those who hear it. With the Barn Owl's chalky white, ethereal face, it is no wonder these animals have captivated our imaginations for centuries. However this great raptor may soon be endangered. In 2013 across Britain, the number of Barn Owl nests had gone down between 24% and 100% of what they once were. Climate Change and the destruction of the Barn Owl's habitat is part of this, but there is another cause of the owl's decline that can be easily stopped with no ill effects: the overuse of Second Generation Anticoagulent Rodenticides. These very powerful rat killers are used on farms throughout the country, in situations where less toxic rodenticides are suitable. Indeed, these highly toxic poisons are used on 76% of farms and by 75% of gamekeepers. After the rodent has taken the poison it continues to live from anywhere between three days to two weeks, during which raptors and birds of prey may eat the rodents and become poisoned themselves. The number of Barn Owls poisoned by SGARs has gone up from 5% in 1984 to 91% in 2010, and the number of Kestrels that ingested this poison was 100% in 2010 and 2011. This bill aims to stop the immodest use of highly toxic poisons and the accidental killing of our nation's symbols by regulating the use of SGARs to only be used in cases after most other non-toxic and less toxic rodent control methods have been tried, and a rodent problem persists.

This goes well with UKIP's Direct Democracy Act (B005 for those of us who were around back then) by encouraging the electorate to be more critical of what the press are telling them, meaning they might be more informed on important decisions they are making. While I am sceptical that the majority of media consumers will actually check these references it is certainly a step in the right direction."

MHOC,3bmh6b,SeyStone,2,Tue Jun 30 12:33:01 2015 UTC,"I seriously don't understand your objection. It's an optional award scheme instead of a mandate for all newspapers so that there's no complaining about 'le freedom of the press'. The advertising campaign encourages people to fact check newspaper articles, and that the newspapers which sign up to the award can be taken at face value - more so than papers without the award, which people should be generally more skeptical of. Newspapers signed up to the scheme will cite all sources possible, hence making it easier for the public to see the first hand facts."

MHOC,3bmh6b,Kerbogha,4,Wed Jul 1 13:11:54 2015 UTC,"I will probably Abstain on this one, as whilst it may be a nice idea I doubt it would work in practice.  How many newspapers would you really expect to join this scheme? And even with the ones who do you can easily quote misleading sources and present incredibly one-sided and untruthful arguments whilst still providing citations for every claim you make.  This could make it seem like a Newspaper is trustowrhty and is telling the truth when they are not. For example the Guardian had an article recently about how after Thatcher productivity growth slowed, and used that to say that Thatcher was bad. Whilst every source was true, it missed out the fact that this has happened in every Western country, and that due to Thatcher our productivity growth slowed down less than the rest of Europe.  Or in the Telegraph a while back, they had a scare story about leaving the EU, using completely truthful sources. However they missed the fact that the report they used as a source discussed 4 potential outcomes of an EU exit, and they only discussed the worst one in the article.  I feel I am rambling a bit here, but what I am trying to say is that a newspaper can use citations and the RR award to seem credible and trustworthy, when they are far from it"
MHOC,3bmh6b,Kerbogha,3,Tue Jun 30 22:03:56 2015 UTC,"Opening Speech  This act essentially enacts a kitemark scheme for factual media, such as newspapers. The idea of a kitemark for newspapers has previously been brought up in the Leveson Inquiry. It is designed to encourage the citing of all factual claims, in order to increase public understanding of the issue at hand. I am hoping that through the advertising campaign outlined, it will be drilled home that only newspapers with one of these kitemarks should be considered reputable sources of factual information - I feel that this is a much needed reality check on modern mass media, considering its status as a figure of authority within the UK.  An example of how this might be useful is if a newspaper posts a story with the headline 'scientists find cure for cancer'. If they are signed up to this scheme, they will have cited the scientific article referenced in the text at the bottom. Interested readers can then use the internet to read the article, which might actually be 'scientists find chemical which, in vitro, stunts growth of specific type of cancer' - which is somewhat different from the original headline. Hence massive independent fact checking can be undertaken by the populace at no additional cost."

In the case of investigative journalism, a lot of sources will want to stay anonymous, especially for sensitive stuff.

MHOC,3bjo9e,Arrikas01,2,Tue Jun 30 12:33:37 2015 UTC,Absolutely not. The owners of the newspaper companies are the ones who have made them what they are and they are the ones who actually own it. The state don't own it and have had very little to do with it previously so have no right whatsoever to dictate how much they can sell it for.
MHOC,3bjo9e,banter_lad_m8,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:12:21 2015 UTC,The vast majority of the daily newspapers of Britain were not created by their present owners and so we cannot say that the owners made the papers what they are.  I agree that we should take the state out of the valuation but it is possible to come to a fair price for them independent of the owner. We cannot allow the owner to set the price themselves as they will inevitably ask for more than a fair price as they know the sale is compulsory.
MHOC,3bjo9e,whigwham,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:39:39 2015 UTC,It's should be theirs to sell and not the state's though. The fact that you are forcing them to sell it and telling them how much they are getting for it is not far from theft.

MHOC,3bjo9e,OKELEUK,5,Mon Jun 29 21:39:57 2015 UTC,I most certainly do not want the state to have control over the press as you should gather from the opening speech.

The first two, heavy Government regulation, which we all know the pitfalls of and the laissez-faire approach, which we have been taking so far, which allows the wealthy absolutely unprecedented power and control over our democracy. Liberal Democracy cannot, in any way, shape or form function healthily without a free, truthful and responsible media. We are slipping away from that in this country, and our democracy will suffer and slip into oligarchy as a result.  This is why this Government chooses a third option, trusting the people. A large group of people cannot be so easily enticed into extreme partisanism, and all the misleading, lying and deceit that goes with it, as a single proprietor. A large group of people stand a far better chance of ensuring that a media outlet is run fairly, with high ethical standards and in the interest of creating a well-informed populous. This Government trusts the people, and that is why we propose to finally let them control their own channels of information, which could hardly be more important in what is the Information Age."
MHOC,3bjo9e,athanaton,10,Mon Jun 29 21:51:10 2015 UTC,"This Government trusts the people   There is your first mistake. The people, for the most part, have no idea how to run a newspaper. I don't think they will create better papers, and I don't really see any reason why they would. They already buy the nonsense that is published, why would they stop publishing nonsense?"
MHOC,3bjo9e,AlbrechtVonRoon,4,Mon Jun 29 22:02:13 2015 UTC,"The bill makes it quite clear that the decisions will not be made solely by the readership, indeed, the staff are given vote of equal weight to the readers and the staff+editor can outvote the readership. Most people also know nothing about running a country, and dare I say, many politicians know precious little of it either. Nonetheless the people vote on who should do it, the politicians do do it, and both receive an array of expert advice on how to make these decisions. This would be no different.  The removal of profit motive is the key to the increase in quality. So long as a paper has a dedicated membership, it will survive, it need no longer endlessly chase the flighty interests of the moment or live from issue to issue."
MHOC,3bjo9e,athanaton,11,Mon Jun 29 22:36:33 2015 UTC,If the Government trusts the people so much why is it telling them how much they have to pay for the newspaper?

What it's worth even more to remember is that the decision is made on independent assessment.

The freedom to own newspapers, the freedom of expression and the freedom of the press are not the same things. A blogger freely typing anything they want online is freedom of expression, a journalist getting an article in a paper uncensored is freedom of the press, a millionaire buying his sixth newspaper is freedom to buy newspapers.

What stops someone with a lot of money using their donation funds to their advantage to effectively own the paper themselves, the exact outcome this bill aims to stop?   1) Any newspaper of general circulation will be available for sale to its readership group.   Standard socialist nonsense.    2) The sale price of the newspaper must be fair to the existing owner and shall be determined by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport on independent financial assessment.   Must feel good for the government to finally be seizing the means of production.   5) Once the the newspaper has been purchased in its entirety it shall cease to run for profit.   And the readership group don't decide this at all? I don't really see why people would want to buy a paper (even one they read) if they're not going to profit out of it, and just lose money to it.   1) The editor of any democratic newspaper shall be directly elected.   This whole idea just totally sucks.    1) the readership group bloc and newspaper group bloc shall have 49% of votes each, the editor shall have 2% of votes.  3) The readership group will elect one of the candidates from the list compiled by the newspaper group, each individual having one equal vote.   Isn't this open to abuse where the readership group only elects someone who will vote with them, giving them 51% of the vote, without any regards to journalistic quality?   4) The elected term of an editor shall be no longer than one year.  5) An individual may not be elected for more than five terms in total at the same newspaper.   Just totally needless, this will have a destructive impact on the quality of press in this country.

Probably only for the Guardian, so perhaps I should be happy for this bill to pass, to see the end of that rag."

What stops someone with a lot of money using their donation funds to their advantage to effectively own the paper themselves, the exact outcome this bill aims to protect?   The readership group operates on a one member one vote basis so wealthy individuals may choose to help the group to buy the paper but would not receive additional votes for doing so.   Must feel good for the government to finally be seizing the means of production.   The state will not own the papers in anyway indeed that would be something I was totally ideological opposed to. I have also stated that this clause will be changed to take government out of the pricing altogether.    And there readership group don't decide this at all? I don't really see why people would want to buy a paper (even one they read) if their not going to profit out of it, and just lose money to it.   The idea is that this is not a financial investment and the readers only profit by ensuring their paper is of high quality and good to read.   Isn't this open to abuse where the readership group only elects someone who will vote with them, giving them 51% of the vote, without any regards to journalistic quality?   The candidates are selected by the newspaper group (staff) before being elected by the readership. So the candidates will be satisfactory to both groups ensuring quality and a paper that works for its writers and readers.   Just totally needless, this will have a destructive impact on the quality of press in this country.   Editors may work at different newspapers across a career and can take non-editorial positions within a paper and continue to contribute usefully.

So the candidates will be satisfactory to both groups ensuring quality and a paper that works for its writers and readers.   I disagree with this bill entirely, but surely then this would just ensure the newspaper staff would have 51% control, thereby rendering the democracy aspect useless. Like in Hong Kong they fought off plans to make it so they could only vote for pre-selected candidates, as they recognised that isn't true democracy at all."
MHOC,3bjo9e,athanaton,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:41:03 2015 UTC,"To stop a scenario where your newspaper is 'hijacked' by people who wouldn't ordinarily read it   The idea of hijack is quite overblown, yes its possible but not very likely.   The idea of taking over the NRA in America has been around for a very long time but it has never happened and that only requires $25 a year each to try to do. To hijack the Daily Mail would require 18,000 lefties (assuming 1% of real subscribers join up) to first subscribe to the paper for £200 a year and then join the readership group for perhaps a further £100 a year. Now perhaps that is possible but it is just not very likely.  Even if they did do this they would only be able to elect the most left wing editorial candidate the staff of the paper put up for vote which almost certainly would not be very left wing, so it would have to be a long term campaign which may very well never succeed.  It would actually be 5 times cheaper to stage a left wing take over of UKIP than it would be to try to take the Mail for one year.   in Hong Kong they fought off plans to make it so they could only vote for pre-selected candidates, as they recognised that isn't true democracy at all.   It certainly ensures the editor is acceptable to the staff of the paper but this is a safeguard to ensure that the newspaper maintains its own editorial position and style.   The difference with Hong Kong is that the selected candidates are democratically elected by a group of stakeholders (the staff) rather than vetted by an undemocratic bureaucratic state.   Both the Labour and Conservative party work in just this fashion, the MPs select candidates for leader and the membership vote on them. Indeed the public's choice of PM is between just two candidates that they had no role whatever in picking and then they only choose indirectly."
MHOC,3bjo9e,Toby_Zeiger,9,Tue Jun 30 11:03:53 2015 UTC,"I am very sad to see this bill supported my party. Newspapers are not supposed to be censored by a diehard core of subscribers who want to control and delete what they please. As mentioned by many other members of the House, a free country does not come without a free press. Although many members of this House mistakenly believe that the newspapers will come under state control, this bill does allow another threat to the news; Censorship by the people. All it takes is an angry mob of diehard subscribers to either outright take the paper over, or can force the paper into any position it wants by threatening it with a buyout.  Then comes the price setting by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport. Why we supposed to believe that this Department is capable of setting prices in such a manner that the newspaper won't be forced into bankruptcy? They will have to multi manage dozens if not hundreds of papers, which makes it almost impossible for them to determine the proper prices of any one. Besides, all it takes is one corrupt manager of prices to rig the prices in such a manner that a monopoly is created.  I urge all members of the house to defeat this bill, and I hope that my friends in Labour come to their senses and vote Nay."

My first question is, how would this be worse than having the paper forced into any position its editor or owner wants? Is being censored by a larger, and therefore by definition, more diverse group, not better than to be by a single person?  Regardless, I disagree with that interpretation of the bill. The readership does not have supreme power, but 49% of the vote to the 51% of those who actually work at the newspaper. So instead of the status quo of supreme and total power of the owner, it is instead split between two groups, forcing compromise. That seems significantly more secure and likely to produce an un-censored product than one person calling all the shots to me."
MHOC,3bjo9e,thewriter1,3,Mon Jun 29 23:05:30 2015 UTC,"As I said to the honorable Minister of Justice, censorship by various groups should be dealt with by using a variation of the Fairness Doctrine. Newspapers should be required to show controversial issues and should be required to show various viewpoints.    The readership does not have supreme power, but 49% of the vote to the 51% of those who actually work at the newspaper.

Newspapers should be required to show controversial issues and should be required to show various viewpoints.   And I'm all for Government regulation, which when combined with this bill, would create a very satisfactory state of affairs. Essentially, why not both?   Has a minority coalition of left-wing parties forced compromise with Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition? Obviously not! Why would this be any different with newspapers? Besides, this readership is by no means the people, as it does not include all readers.   Aside from the fact that there is a left majority (of 1 seat), there has been compromise. It is not overt or grandiose, but if there was none then we would not have seen a single piece of Opposition legislation passed and far less from the Government. Regardless, there has certainly been more compromise than there would be if we turned all the power back to the Monarch, who in our little allegory is the newspaper owner."

As an example, some 99% of scientists believe that climate change is anthropogenic (man made/caused). Scientifically speaking, this is not up for debate. However, forcing opposing views to exist can cause the disingenuous position where it appears like both sides of the argument have equal merit, when in fact the truth is very far from it.

And why would the Government determine the value of the newspaper upon its sale to the readership group?   The language of the bill is also extremely vague, and it provides almost no exact instructions as to how the newspaper, once purchased by its readership group, should set the membership fee (and it is not specified whether this is upon entrance to the group, or periodically recurring), select candidates for the position of editor, decide on general policy for the administration of the paper, or indeed much else. It only says ""democratically"". I trust that the members of this House are in favour of the democratic system, but in this context this term is horribly ambiguous.   As for the election of an editor, who is to determine what counts as a journalist? What are the duties of the editor once elected?

Why would a sufficiently large group of readers have any interest in taking control of the newspaper to which they subscribe?   They may not, there is no requirement to do so but the bill provides the opportunity for those who can see the benefits of a cooperatively run newspaper.    who is to say that this group would be at all qualified to do so?    The subscribers have only a 49% control over the newspaper, another 49% being controlled by the journalistic staff who are perhaps more qualified to run the paper. The editor is to be chosen from amongst the profession too and so will have an understanding of how to run the newspaper.   It is worth noting that there are no required qualifications to become a shareholder of a public traded company and that those unqualified shareholders have votes in the running of most of our economy.   The readership group here are simply shareholders voting as shareholders would.   And why would the Government determine the value of the newspaper upon its sale to the readership group?   They are to base the assessment on independent valuations but I have already stated I am happy to amend the bill to make the process entirely independent of government.  As to any vagueness in the wording, I am most open to any amendments suggested.   should set the membership fee   It was intended that the fee be decided by the members of the readership group democratically. As to how that democratic decision be taken I though it could be left to the group to decide. I am willing to take ideas on tightening this up.   and it is not specified whether this is upon entrance to the group, or periodically recurring   The bill states the fee shall be annual.   select candidates for the position of editor   The bill states that the newspaper group (staff) shall pick a minimum of 3 journalists by popular vote inside the bloc.   decide on general policy for the administration of the paper   For sake of brevity I have not listed all the decisions they might take but perhaps could look at the legal governing of shareholders and adopt that framework.

A readership reads their particular newspaper because they believe them to be a reliable source which also align with their sensibilities. A paper does not serve all people, but its readership. If the readership deems that something is wrong with the paper they will say so, and the paper usually acts accordingly.   Also, the Prime Minister assumes that everyone who reads a paper is also a subscriber (as that would be the only way a 'Reader' Council could work in regards to membership) when they are not. Some simply pick up the paper as and when. What is the Prime Minister going to do? Force subscriptions? What if subscribers do not want to run it, but just read it? Reading papers is not nearly as tribalistic as the Prime Minister thinks - I myself read The Independent, Private Eye, and The Economist, along with individual articles from the BBC and occasional columns in The Spectator. Someone else might read The Telegraph and The Daily Mail, with glances at The Sun.   This does not democratise papers, it merely hands their running to the subscribers, which might actually be a minority.   EDIT: Furthermore - does the Prime Minister even know why the public pays for papers? To pay the journalists, columnists, researchers, cartoonists, pundits, admin and clerical staff, freelancers, photographers, and a whole host of others. It is bad enough that writers in this country, for the most part, have to do their work for free but now the Prime Minister expects them to do the rest of the work for free?

This should ensure that each paper retains its individual editorial position and that papers do not blend into one homogeneous journalistic edifice.   I had no idea that The Independent had the same views as The Daily Mail, or that The Telegraph held the same views as The Guardian. Who would have thought it?    There is pointedly no limit on the number of newspapers that an individual can join the readership group of, so long as they subscribe   Some democracy.    I think it is important to note that the creative staff of the papers gain a large amount of influence and control over the paper and so the subscribers power to effect change is limited.   Utter rubbish - it is largely down to the editors. Who are being replaced with this version of one of the Prime Minister's old colleagues 'worker councils'. Truly, well thought out."

Editors will not be able to bring in long-term plans for the future growth and success of their newspapers, as they will be replaced before it can even be shown to work. How then, with their job at such risk every year, will a newspaper editor be able to grow its circulation, or at least manage its decline? Surely they will be more focused on keeping the Readership Group happy in order to secure his job for another year than on important issues such as the paper's direction."

If you want to prevent certain groups from taking control of the media, then get the State to properly break it up.  I mean really, who the hell is going to be that interested in setting up a readership group to take control of a newspaper they already read and are quite clearly happy with? What utter nonsense is this! If you want a new press, then set up your own. Maybe a special fund could be set up to aid the formation of new newspapers, although we would naturally need to establish some restrictions.  Surely this prevents new papers being set up as well? Why would I ever set up a press organ to represent my views, if one day a bunch of left wingers could start paying for being in the readership circle, and then subvert all my efforts?   Once the the newspaper has been purchased in its entirety it shall cease to run for profit.   So how the hell will the paper be funded?  This really is the thin end of the wedge. It is the most childish and immature democracy for the sake of democracy. Without thought or reason, someone has noted that people could have a say in how a paper is run, and decided that that must be good.  And, here is my real fear: no one in the Government will actually think about this. They will just blindly vote for it. Well, if anyone is reading this from outside of the odd anarchist circles, think for a second about how ridiculous it is that members of a 'readership circle' (whose membership may be restricted due to membership fees, who knows how it will actually be formed) ma just suddenly subvert the efforts of a well oiled machine. A group of people have, over decades, built up a press office, a whole system, and suddenly these people with no idea how to run a business can suddenly buy it?  And of course, all of this will not improve the papers. Yes, they may be independent of oligarchs, but they won't be independent of the uninformed opinions of the public, nor will they aid them.

What is more, what this country is missing, what this entire generation is missing, more and more, is a pride in one's community and the drive to get up and make things better themselves. This will not be created through incessant and hypocritical moaning of 'kids these days' from crusty old politicians and talking heads. For people to have this, they must first have responsibility. People will be interested in helping their favorite newspaper when it is required of them for it to survive.   Surely this prevents new papers being set up as well?

MHOC,3bjo9e,tyroncs,3,Mon Jun 29 23:06:41 2015 UTC,"For one thing, not-for-profit doesn't mean non-profit - it means that the company reinvests its profits back into itself, instead of distributing it as dividends.

An excellent analogy here is UK political parties themselves, especially ones like the Greens, who have the membership base vote on potential policies. You have to pay a certain amount of money to join, and that gives you one vote. There is absolutely nothing stopping a 1,000,000+ strong organisation buying membership, buying tickets to the Green conference, and completely changing the course of the party. But is this really particularly likely?"

That makes it more of a rich person's venture.   Think about it - who would be most likely to by the Guardian? Students. What student has £1000 spending money? It is funny that the member chooses political parties as an example - Liberal Democrat membership starts at £1 with the Liberal Youth membership covering a full one until 25 years of age.   By the by - what happens to freelancers? They, due to the very nature of the job, cannot own any part of the papers. They certainly cannot afford to join a readers' council for that amount!"
MHOC,3bjo9e,JamMan35,3,Mon Jun 29 23:26:59 2015 UTC,"I said that it can cost up to £1000. As it says in the bill, the price is set by the readership group. There is no reason why it couldn't be £5, and there's no reason why it couldn't be £572 - the cost for a year's 7 day subscription to the Guardian (with digital download). In fact, there's nothing stopping the newspaper from selling membership like a subscription - buy membership, get the newspaper for free!   what happens to freelancers?   Since they don't work for the paper (in fact, some have worked for multiple papers), it would not make sense for them to be involved in the democratic ownership of it, from the newspaper bloc.

MHOC,3bjo9e,AlbrechtVonRoon,3,Tue Jun 30 12:23:33 2015 UTC,"There's a number of reasons why this bill is ultimately bad.  Firstly, its entire premise is paradoxical.  The rationale behind it is that newspapers affect the views or their readers.  This is true, but readers generally share views with their newspaper of choice.  Therefore by turning control over to readers, the newspaper would have the exact same biases as before in the best-case scenario, or, more likely, inflict new biases from the Readership Group.  Freedom of speech and press are buzzwords thrown around a lot, but this bill truly is an affront to those concepts.  Calling it ""Democratic Control"" doesn't change the fact that this is a government mandate forcing private press to yield to organizations dictating what they can say.  The most unforgivable part of this bill is its utter uselessness.  Everything this bill aims to do is done more efficiently and freely through capitalism.  Media already reflect the views of their readers because that's what sells papers.  Adding so much over-complication and government intervention only produces many more factors to go wrong."
MHOC,3bjo9e,The_Hamburger,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:44:57 2015 UTC,"The rationale behind it is that newspapers affect the views or their readers   They do. Newspapers speak from a position of authority. Why do you think so many people still believe that the MMR vaccine causes autism, despite nearly the entire scientific community, the NHS, and Tony Blair himself saying otherwise?   the newspaper would have the exact same biases as before in the best-case scenario, or, more likely, inflict new biases from the Readership Group.   Not really, and we're not trying to end biases anyway, since that's something of an uphill struggle - we're trying to stop individuals who have been born into power from using their influence over the media to their own benefit.   Freedom of speech and press are buzzwords thrown around a lot, but this bill truly is an affront to those concepts.    'Freedom of the press is just a buzzword, but what happened to freedom of the press?' is a bizarre statement to make   Calling it ""Democratic Control"" doesn't change the fact that this is a government mandate forcing private press to yield to organizations dictating what they can say.   It's so much better when owners of media groups dictate what they say and the newspapers yield, of course.   Everything this bill aims to do is done more efficiently and freely through capitalism.   Okay no. The newspaper media in its current form commits massive misinformation at best ('SCIENTISTS FIND CURE FOR CANCER'), or are completely unethical at worst (News of the World et al phone hacking affair) - and both of these happen on a regular basis. Beyond that, when something like the MMR vaccine 'controversy' pops up, the press spread what can really be considered nothing more than lies, causing suffering in families who don't get the vaccine nationwide. It doesn't matter what 'sells', because if what sells is someone saying 'bleach can be used as an excellent mouthwash', the newspapers (speaking from an unquestioned position of authority) would be directly responsible for however many deaths this would cause.  This could be averted under this bill, however, if the readership and journalists voted at the newspaper conference to accept a minimum level of evidence, or signed up to a scheme designed to minimise misinformation - such as the one proposed in b125, which you will see tonight or tomorrow."

MHOC,3bif04,athanaton,5,Mon Jun 29 19:32:05 2015 UTC,Can the right honourable gentleman please confirm that he supports the Official Opposition's Local Government (England) Bill?
MHOC,3bif04,RoryTime,3,Mon Jun 29 19:00:30 2015 UTC,"I do not support it in it's current form, however the next reading of the bill should be more promising."
MHOC,3bif04,Djenial,5,Tue Jun 30 14:56:48 2015 UTC,"Does the Rt. Hon. Secretary of State for Communities, &c. have any large-scale reforms planned for local government?"
MHOC,3bif04,GunmetalSigma,3,Mon Jun 29 15:06:48 2015 UTC,"Not personally, although there are lots of bills written by others that will have a large scale impact within my department."
MHOC,3bif04,Djenial,4,Tue Jun 30 14:57:28 2015 UTC,What has the SoS achieved whilst in office?
MHOC,3bif04,GhoulishBulld0g,2,Mon Jun 29 15:16:04 2015 UTC,"Not much yet, I have had a variety of things happening in real life such as mocks and expeditions which have hampered my process slightly, but rest assured there are things in the works."
MHOC,3bif04,Djenial,2,Tue Jun 30 14:24:38 2015 UTC,Good to hear. I am glad this department is handled by Labour. At least some logic would be used.
MHOC,3bif04,GhoulishBulld0g,2,Tue Jun 30 14:53:34 2015 UTC,"I am glad you have confidence in my party, this department is often managed by Labour and I am pleased to be continuing the tradition."
MHOC,3bif04,Djenial,3,Tue Jun 30 15:07:46 2015 UTC,Could the right honorable gentleman highlight just how different rural communities are to urban ones.
MHOC,3bif04,Jas1066,2,Mon Jun 29 17:12:32 2015 UTC,"I would think this question rather simple for someone to answer in their own head, but if you look at an urban area you will see lots of buildings and roads, whereas in rural areas you will see lots of trees and green.   There are also differing jobs in these two areas, inner city jobs are generally higher paid (with a higher cost of living) and rural jobs tend to be more agricultural or manual labour."
MHOC,3bif04,Djenial,4,Tue Jun 30 14:23:32 2015 UTC,"Although I can see great potential for the SoS and I to work together, such potential for co-operation has been in short supply in-between the two wider coalitions. Does he attribute his Government's two previous defeats on Education to an uncompromising Education Secretary (although his most recent bill seems more moderate) or to the Communists' horrendous voting record?"
MHOC,3bif04,RoryTime,2,Mon Jun 29 19:05:58 2015 UTC,"The Education Secretary is deeply committed to his cause, I am not accountable for his 'uncompromising' nature, if you wish to call it that. The Communist voting record has been bad (and as Chief Whip, it is concerning that my efforts are not getting through), but I would like to refer you to the UKIP voting record, which is hardly unblemished."
MHOC,3bif04,Djenial,2,Tue Jun 30 14:20:16 2015 UTC,"May I thank the SoS for his responses and clarify that I apportion absolutely no blame to my right honourable friend for the Communist voting (or lack thereof) record, indeed I sort of admire him, Mr Speaker because as a prominent, English, Welsh Greens member said very recently, 'the communists are just awful', which must make it a very frustrating job indeed."
MHOC,3bif04,RoryTime,2,Tue Jun 30 14:39:51 2015 UTC,"No one in government is in my opinion is awful, but there are certainly some characters. I thank the right honourable member for his compliment, I too admire him for his work in the model world and the running of this great house."
MHOC,3bif04,Djenial,4,Tue Jun 30 15:06:19 2015 UTC,"Please may the SoS inform the House on the implications of B124 for local newspapers, and give us his opinion of his Government's bill?"
MHOC,3bif04,RoryTime,3,Mon Jun 29 20:12:34 2015 UTC,"Whilst I think that newspapers are badly run and are in need of change, I think that the state having the power to set the price of the free press is unnecessary and over controlling. I do however think that the premise of the bill is a good idea."
MHOC,3bif04,Djenial,2,Tue Jun 30 14:17:48 2015 UTC,So if an independent entity set the price (and not independent in the TETP sense) you'd be fully behind the bill and would back it completely?
MHOC,3bif04,RoryTime,3,Tue Jun 30 14:21:02 2015 UTC,"I would still rather the state didn't interfere with the price of the free press. I am also not overly confident that the readership will want to partake in the running of the newspaper, I know the people I deliver to in the morning would not."
MHOC,3bif04,Djenial,5,Tue Jun 30 15:03:34 2015 UTC,Do you believe giving power to some form of regional governments/assemblies is inevitable?
MHOC,3bif04,Gartles-eth,2,Mon Jun 29 22:14:41 2015 UTC,"I will partly refer you to the answer I gave to /u/Elcuchinibre, whilst I'm opposed to handing over too much control I think it is inevitable that their will be more powers devolved in the future. I don't think it is necessary for extra governments and assemblies to be formed, for then we are approaching Communist level bureaucracy!"
MHOC,3bif04,Djenial,2,Tue Jun 30 14:16:27 2015 UTC,Thank you very much for your answer.
MHOC,3bif04,Gartles-eth,3,Tue Jun 30 14:32:25 2015 UTC,How does the Secretary of State feel about devolution to local councils?
MHOC,3bif04,Elcuchinibre,2,Mon Jun 29 14:33:04 2015 UTC,"I think that most councils are more acutely aware of the issues their local area face, although I'm of the position that too much devolution  is damaging to our United Kingdom. I think that councils currently have a good amount of powers devolved to them, and only on a case by case basis would I consider anything extra. Congratulations on the formation of your party, I hope we can work together in the near future."

MHOC,3bif04,HaveADream,2,Mon Jun 29 15:24:53 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call the rest of the term short, with the government now stronger than ever I can see us going forward for many further months.   In the rest of this session, I plan on bringing in a bill to build more homes, especially on brownfield sites. I am also in talks with some other Labour colleagues about further devolution to Cornwall, although that is up in the air at the moment. Unrelated to my position as Secretary of State, I also have a government bill coming forward next month, the 'Sale of Helium Act'. Thank you for your interest."
MHOC,3bif04,Djenial,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:11:05 2015 UTC,I thank the right honourable member for his answer.
MHOC,3bif04,HaveADream,3,Tue Jun 30 15:19:22 2015 UTC,"Mr. Speaker, could the Right Honourable gentlemen and his shadow tell the house what they believe is the biggest issue they face?"
MHOC,3bif04,UnderwoodF,2,Mon Jun 29 15:50:28 2015 UTC,"Could you define your question, the biggest question I face in terms of my position, or just in general?"
MHOC,3bif04,Djenial,3,Tue Jun 30 14:08:08 2015 UTC,What is the SoS' opinion on the recent ruling coming from Preston which didn't allow fracking to occur in the area?
MHOC,3bif04,Jonster123,3,Mon Jun 29 23:53:40 2015 UTC,"I am mostly opposed to the idea of fracking, if there are areas which are open to it then they have the power to accept it, however there is  lots of opposition. I support their decision."
MHOC,3bif04,Djenial,2,Tue Jun 30 14:36:27 2015 UTC,Will the SoS (/u/Djenial) be answering questions today?
MHOC,3bif04,RoryTime,2,Tue Jun 30 14:00:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, as you know this session is open for 3 days."
MHOC,3bif04,Djenial,2,Tue Jun 30 14:06:45 2015 UTC,"Ok, I was just wondering whether you hadn't seen it :p (hence why I quoted your /u/)."
MHOC,3bif04,RoryTime,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:15:11 2015 UTC,"I had, but thanks anyway :P I was waiting for any other questions and for everyone to upvote, so that I could prioritise my longest and most in depth answers."

MHOC,3bfr5q,Kreindeker,16,Sun Jun 28 21:10:15 2015 UTC,There was a really good Tory in-joke before the election but eventually they had to actually publish their manifesto.
MHOC,3bfr5q,MorganC1,4,Sun Jun 28 21:28:22 2015 UTC,Like the socialist in-joke that is the Educational Secretary.
MHOC,3bfr5q,HaveADream,3,Mon Jun 29 15:22:44 2015 UTC,"I'll have you know, the Socialist Party have the good sense and morals to avoid in-jokes."
MHOC,3bfr5q,MorganC1,2,Mon Jun 29 17:02:44 2015 UTC,"Yep, unfortunately you shared your in-joke with the rest of the House."

MHOC,3bfr5q,treeman1221,5,Mon Jun 29 06:52:37 2015 UTC,"Don't the Communists refuse to accept Peerages, or is that not the case?"
MHOC,3bfr5q,Kerbogha,3,Mon Jun 29 06:52:41 2015 UTC,I think they are accepting them; but if they don't then the seats will remain empty.
MHOC,3bfr5q,WineRedPsy,3,Mon Jun 29 06:52:46 2015 UTC,It's complicated
MHOC,3bfr5q,Duncs11,3,Mon Jun 29 01:03:07 2015 UTC,Could you provide a simplified explanation?
MHOC,3bfr5q,WineRedPsy,3,Sun Jun 28 23:08:54 2015 UTC,No. Mostly because I'm not really sure.  I think that we'll take our positions but abstain on things that aren't HoL reform?
MHOC,3bfr5q,thewriter1,2,Sun Jun 28 21:16:48 2015 UTC,"Ah, the Sinn Fein approach then?"
MHOC,3bfr5q,WineRedPsy,2,Sun Jun 28 21:17:47 2015 UTC,I thought they just didn't take their seats?
MHOC,3bfr5q,thewriter1,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:19:53 2015 UTC,"They do not take their seats and seem to abstain on everything as a result, I believe."
MHOC,3bfr5q,WineRedPsy,2,Sun Jun 28 21:22:57 2015 UTC,Does the RL HOC not distinguish between abstains and DNVs?
MHOC,3bfr5q,thewriter1,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:30:37 2015 UTC,I'm not sure.
MHOC,3bfr5q,ieya404,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:01:52 2015 UTC,"It's certainly possible to ""positively abstain"" by going through both lobbies, which is obviously different to not voting at all.  (And, indeed, taking your seat and not voting is different to not taking the seat at all)."
MHOC,3bfr5q,Duncs11,2,Sun Jun 28 23:12:15 2015 UTC,"This also raises the issue of the Scottish National Party, who in RL don't take up any seats in the House of Lords, I would be interested to see if the MHOC Party are taking the same stance."
MHOC,3bfr5q,mg9500,4,Sun Jun 28 23:13:11 2015 UTC,"We will be taking up our party seats, as they are elected but will be refusing to accept achievement seats."

MHOC,3bfr5q,trident46,4,Sun Jun 28 23:17:35 2015 UTC,I think I can speak for everyone when I say that this is a huge step and this will be a huge evolution for our community. I am excited and hopeful for what the House of Lords may yield.

MHOC,3bfr5q,RoryTime,2,Sun Jun 28 22:02:44 2015 UTC,"Salisbury Convention   There will be no line from the mods on it as it is something for the parties and Lords to decide. Personally I will respect it insofar as I won't try to block anything in the manifesto of the largest party.    Amendments in the commons   This is a seperate thing ATM, however I'm personally in favour of implementing an amendment system, and will talk to Athanaton about how it may work."
MHOC,3bfr5q,athanaton,0,Sun Jun 28 23:00:55 2015 UTC,the manifesto of the largest party   Well that's already an interesting interpretation ;)
MHOC,3bfr5q,RoryTime,2,Mon Jun 29 01:07:28 2015 UTC,For some reason I rather like that interpretation ;).

MHOC,3bfr5q,athanaton,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:27:55 2015 UTC,"will there be a system where amendments can be tabled in the commons?   The Speaker is, shall we say, reticent, to implement this now. What we will have is a Commons committee of 5 MPs who will;   Review amendments to bills originating in the Commons by the Lords. Amend bills originating in the Lords.   However, bills originating in the Commons will still not be able to be amended by the Commons. It is my hope that when we move on to implementing Select Committees in both chambers, that the Commons Amendment Committee has its remit expanded to include amending Commons bills."
MHOC,3bfr5q,Ajubbajub,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:40:08 2015 UTC,I quite like the system that they use in MUSG where by any rep can propose an amendment but then it needs to be seconded by I think half of the other reps to be added. I think that system would need some tweaking to work here. I know its not true the real thing but in order to make the game more fun then i would certainly endorse this system.
MHOC,3bfr5q,athanaton,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:13:05 2015 UTC,"Well that's not how the RL HoC does it and would probably never be allowed by the Speaker because it's too hectic, disordered and with extreme administrative overhead. The RL Public Bill Committee system I think also would not work here for a variety of reasons, so we compromise with a Select Committee. That too has nice gameplay elements, such as the Chairman being elected by the House, but keeps the process ordered and efficient."
MHOC,3bfr5q,Ajubbajub,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:42:25 2015 UTC,"Also five members is way too few as there will be half the parties with no representation on the committee a sensible and fair way would be have a new select committee for each bill or a committee for each type of bill e.g. Money, home affairs etc."
MHOC,3bfr5q,athanaton,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:47:24 2015 UTC,"The reason it's so small is it's straight from my Select Committee proposal which contained 8 Commons Select Committees and 2 Joint Committees. There simply aren't enough MPs to have them bigger. I hope, given that they are relatively minor disruptions, the Select Committees will not be too far behind the HoL."
MHOC,3bfr5q,Ajubbajub,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:45:36 2015 UTC,Im not sure im quite getting it atm. Is the proposal to have 1 commons select ctte with 5 members or multiple committees?
MHOC,3bfr5q,athanaton,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:16:28 2015 UTC,"The only committee in this proposal is 1 committee with 5 members, because the HoL can't be implemented without some mechanism for reviewing and tabling of amendments.  My proposal for fuller implementation of Select Committees, which has not yet been fully discussed and is not being put to the House at this time, proposes 15 committees across both Houses."
MHOC,3bfr5q,Ajubbajub,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:25:16 2015 UTC,I am now clear. That is a lot of committees
MHOC,3bfr5q,RoryTime,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:31:12 2015 UTC,I do think that in the future it could be quite good to have a load of select committees.

MHOC,3bfr5q,athanaton,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:44:54 2015 UTC,"Noone can't comment in /r/mhoc, and that will of course include Lords too.

Are you going to apologise for this (dumb) misunderstanding? I'm sure you weren't deliberately trying to misrepresent my words. The reason I think you must be dumb to make this mistake is because the probable way in which it happened was because you just skimmed over my post, saw the words ""transgender"" and ""idiot"" said in the same sentence by a right-wing person, and decided to create a phony outrage, shrieking: ""My God!

This programme would give people this sense of security and validation that their life mattered.   I will hope that the members of this house will join me in supporting people that can no longer support themselves. There is more to healthcare than just medicine and surgery.

We are talking about giving a little extra care and attention to those most vulnerable in our society which should always be one of the governments highest priority's.  Perhaps these scheme might be able to give scope to helping another vulnerable group of society at the same time.  Non violent criminals who are ordered to repay their debt with community service could be offered some minor counselling training and then sent to spend time with those who need someone to talk to at the end of there lives.  I think these two groups of people are at a stage in there lives when all they needs is someone to talk and this could offer a mutually beneficial arrangement.

MHOC,3belle,Timanfya,3,Sun Jun 28 14:41:43 2015 UTC,Changes since last reading:   Introduces a state funded scheme to make sure that every house has a small fire extinguisher available - courtesy to /u/CockTorpedo for the idea. Fire suppression systems only required in hotspots that are located in the planning stage. Minor grammatical changes.
MHOC,3belle,TheQuipton,3,Sun Jun 28 14:51:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry to be a pain, but i'm not sure mandating a specific type of fire extinguisher is necessary - foam extinguishers are considered 'impractical for home use' since they need to be in large cannisters. Power extinguishers can be available in smaller cannisters too, but they both have advantages and disadvantages. Specifying a non-water extinguisher would be good - since this is a minor change it can be changed before the vote without another reading"
MHOC,3belle,Cocktorpedo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:21:32 2015 UTC,I will do just that :)
MHOC,3belle,TheQuipton,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:56:22 2015 UTC,"There are 5 different types of Fire Extinguishers, each with their own specialties.  So unless you plan on making everyone have 5 different types in their home, this bill is hopelessly unrealistic."
MHOC,3belle,AdamMc66,3,Sun Jun 28 21:41:23 2015 UTC,"I am searching for negative aspects of this bill, and failing miserably. I do however have a question - surely, some households already have small foam fire extinguishers? This hasn't been taken into account in the approximate total cost, which leads me to wonder whether or not these households will receive a new extinguisher anyway."
MHOC,3belle,TheInfernalRain,2,Sun Jun 28 16:40:33 2015 UTC,I think that's more down to the lack of a statistic for who already has fire extinguishers. The way I'm hoping it will work is everyone is entitled to one fire extinguisher every five years but for example if they have a fire and use there's they can get another free of charge (providing it wasn't like totally misused). This section will probably be slightly tightened before it goes to vote.
MHOC,3belle,TheQuipton,3,Mon Jun 29 11:58:31 2015 UTC,How will you implement this across all households effectively i.e not wasting taxpayer money?
MHOC,3belle,819gaming,6,Sun Jun 28 20:09:40 2015 UTC,I don't think any taxpaper money is being wasted when it is being used to stop fire burning said taxpayers to death.
MHOC,3belle,MorganC1,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:26:13 2015 UTC,"Apologies, I wasn't clear enough.  As a scenario say they buy 100 Fire Extinguishers what if all fire extinguishers aren't put in all 100 households then what happens to the money the taxpayer paid to have these."
MHOC,3belle,819gaming,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:11:51 2015 UTC,"Ah that is a far better question, one I am sure will be answered. Thank you for the clarification."
MHOC,3belle,MorganC1,2,Mon Jun 29 17:03:24 2015 UTC,"Well, the provision is:   One small foam fire extinguisher will be made available to each household from the local fire authority.   This could be done by a fairly simple opt-in (or opt-out?) checkbox with the annual council tax demand, for 'Please supply my complimentary household fire extinguisher' - which would give  you a good idea of the number of extinguishers to be supplied, so there shouldn't be horrendous over-ordering."
MHOC,3belle,ieya404,2,Mon Jun 29 23:42:40 2015 UTC,"It's all well and good working out the cost of everything, but where is the money coming from and are we making it back?"
MHOC,3belle,HaveADream,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:56:40 2015 UTC,The money will be coming from the government's pocket and with regards to making it back - there are probably some equations out there as to what a human life is worth but in my opinion the cost of this is practically nominal and it will save lives. Even if it just saves one life then this bill has succeeded in my book.
MHOC,3belle,TheQuipton,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:00:14 2015 UTC,I will support this bill. We could probably get cheaper extinguishers as well. Will people be trained how to use them?
MHOC,3belle,HaveADream,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:34:15 2015 UTC,"Foam extinguishers can't be used on electrical fires. Many of the fires in the home are electrical. A dry powder extinguisher would be safer. While co2 ones can also be used on electrical fires, operation by untrained personnel can be dangerous. For this reason I believe dry powder is the best option."

While India for example has a space program and nuclear weapons, 21.9% of its people live below the poverty line.

MHOC,3baqdl,AlbertDock,7,Sat Jun 27 14:24:59 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, but not always. I think we should use this smartly and not be absolute about it. For example Sierra Leone has had some serious issues with human rights, but I believe that due to the recent epidemic of Ebola that Sierra Leone is in no place to receive cuts, but instead should have its aid increased. In cases when it is beneficial for the people of the country in question for us to cut aid, so that the human rights given to them increase, while also not threatening them economically and health-wise to harshly, we should."

MHOC,3baqdl,SPQR1776,2,Sat Jun 27 20:31:25 2015 UTC,Can you justify the money taken out of hard working families' pockets and given to a wealthy India?

MHOC,3b2fm0,Tim-Sanchez,11,Thu Jun 25 12:44:09 2015 UTC,"In my opinion this bill is seriously flawed in many ways, and I urge all members to at least read my comment before deciding which way to vote.  Firstly, I shall list the issues I have with the selected sports that have been put into Category A. I currently believe way too many have been included, or at least certain sports of equal importance have been snubbed:   Great North Run - Why? Does this seriously need to be aired in its entirety? I can appreciate showing it online, but how has this been deemed of national importance? I doubt many people want to watch the entire Great North Run. Rugby World Cup (All Matches) - I'm not sure games like Samoa vs Tonga have ""national importance"" in the UK, so I don't see why every match needs to be included here. I could accept the home nations being included. Great Britain Davis Cup Matches - I'm not sure this is quite on par with the other events in terms of importance, but I'll concede I'm no tennis expert. Personally I don't think the early rounds of the Davis Cup whip the nation into a frenzy the way Wimbledon or even other Grand Slam tournaments do. Women's Rugby (Union) World Cup Final - I'm really at a loss as to why this has been included. It really isn't on a par with anything else in that list, and it's way less popular than the Women's football World Cup or FA Cup final. The only reason I can think it is included is due to equality, because it certainly isn't due to national importance. It's also less important than other events further below. If this is included, then why not the Women's Ashes? Or England Test matches? Surely England Tests are way more important than this? Rugby in home nations - why is there no inclusion of Scottish rugby matches in their national section?   Secondly, I find it very problematic that Ofcom now lose control over this. I believe it needs to be decided by an independent body and not by politicians. Whilst my motion pressured Ofcom, it ultimately retained their independence and allowed them to look into the situation. I feel like only allowing politicians to change what is shown on national TV is a real step too far. Especially allowing the Prime Minister to randomly designate events important. This should absolutely be the role of somebody far more independent than him, or at least a committee. It's an utterly ridiculous power to give the Prime Minister. Ultimately though, I just question why the Ofcom Code needed to be repealed altogether?   Finally, this act comes into force way too early. Sky Sports have a deal to show all England cricket matches and the World Cup until at least 2019, and the bill includes no provision as to what happens to this contract. Other sports may well be under a contract that causes problems for this bill, cricket was just the obvious one that leapt up at me.   Overall, I am not entirely against reorganising the system again as I know my motion wasn't perfect. Certain things could have been added or changed, but this particularly bill is very problematic to me.  TL;DR: Inconsistent choices of sports and too many inclusions. Gives politicians too much power when it should be an independent body. Doesn't make provisions for the breaking of contracts that will occur."
MHOC,3b2fm0,mg9500,2,Thu Jun 25 17:29:55 2015 UTC,The sports were agreed upon by the whole Broad Left Coalition and the power for the prime minister to designate events important was also conceived there. As in the opening speech this will probably be used for royal or state occasions that happen once every 20 years.  The independent body was proved ineffective when it 'negotiated' to let the ECB remove England Cricket from Category A without having proved to gain anything from the negotiations.  Contracts wouldn't have to be broken. This act does not prohibit the events also being shown on pay-TV so new contracts for Scottish Football matches (example) would be drafted by UEFA but the exsisting contract with Sky could continue as well.
MHOC,3b2fm0,Tim-Sanchez,5,Thu Jun 25 18:52:04 2015 UTC,"As in the opening speech this will probably be used for royal or state occasions that happen once every 20 years.   ""Probably""? According to who? If I was Prime Minister I could just do whatever I like with this bill, there are no guidelines as to what is a state or historical occasion.    The independent body was proved ineffective when it 'negotiated' to let the ECB remove England Cricket from Category A without having proved to gain anything from the negotiations.   What evidence is there that politicians will do a better job? If anything this will cause massively increased lobbying from media groups such as BSkyB who have a vested interest in this.   Contracts wouldn't have to be broken. This act does not prohibit the events also being shown on pay-TV   Perhaps you didn't click the link I provided? Sky have the contract as an exclusive provider of England cricket, so the contract would be broken if another channel showed them live."
MHOC,3b2fm0,mg9500,2,Thu Jun 25 18:57:59 2015 UTC,The contract issue will have to be looked at.  EDIT: A clause could be included saying '...which may be sold separately). Each event becomes a category [A/B] event after the expiration of the current contract.'

If you asked the people of Northern Ireland who followed football to choose between an FA Cup final between Arsenal and Chelsea or an IFA Cup final between Portadown and Crusaders, I can assure you that the majority would pick the FA Cup final."

I have lived in Belfast all my life and I can tell you that football is on the same level if not bigger than GAA and rugby in many areas.

In regards to the bill at hand, it seems a wide plethora of nice international events and regional club team finals, and then you go and include Old Firm matches which are of no significance to most outside of Glasgow."
MHOC,3b2fm0,ieya404,2,Thu Jun 25 14:43:50 2015 UTC,"Old firm games were included for a number of reasons:   Scotland only has one dominant sport; Wales has rugby, England Cricket and NI has GAA so I felt I had to include something extra. Violence is a large problem at old firm games; this may help. People will be discouraged from going into the city centre to watch this in pubs and get drunk as they can watch at home. Even if they get drunk, less damage will get done."
MHOC,3b2fm0,Tim-Sanchez,3,Thu Jun 25 16:27:10 2015 UTC,"I've said this before and I'll say it again:   If you want to include something else for Scots, it should be the Scottish Open or the Scottish Grand National. Even if your idea that people won't go down the pub works, domestic violence already increases dramatically after Old Firm games and this'll make things worse   I don't understand why there's not more Scottish rugby instead of this game.  Although I personally don't care for it, rugby has a huge following.  Or, if it is just more football for the sake of having something else for Scotland, why not mandate 20-25 SPFL games throughout the four leagues?  Rather than just four games (unless you're including SC/SLC games between the two as well) that most in the country don't actually care about"
MHOC,3b2fm0,TheQuipton,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:29:52 2015 UTC,"I agree that trying to enshrine two particular teams in legislation seems like the wrong approach (not to mention the potential arguments when one of those teams goes into liquidation and has its assets bought by a new limited company).  I can understand separating out truly national (or international) events.  But to single out two specific domestic teams is quite wrong.  Rangers and Celtic certainly have a strong following, but that doesn't mean they're automatically more deserving of a place on television than Hearts, or Aberdeen, or indeed Inverness Caley Thistle.  While I am overall not sure that we should - as politicians - really be laying down a set list of events, rather than allowing an independent body to make judgement calls (and with the ability to change those events from year to year if needed without needing primary legislation), I find myself in agreement with the Secretary of State that if you do need to single out something extra for Scotland, then the Scottish Open (Scotland, after all, being the home of golf) would be more appropriate."

MHOC,3b2fm0,Tim-Sanchez,3,Fri Jun 26 08:01:24 2015 UTC,A smaller list exsits in real life and the BBC seems to get by.
MHOC,3b2fm0,MorganC1,2,Fri Jun 26 12:34:22 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I don't think this is a very valid argument. Any company could buy the broadcasting rights, even Sky Sports, and then just put it on a freeview channel for the day."
MHOC,3b2fm0,mg9500,2,Fri Jun 26 14:29:48 2015 UTC,"Opening Speech:  Mr Deputy Speaker,   Many events are of the importance that the public have a right to see them; from the royal wedding to England's run at Italia 90 to London 2012, this bill protects them for the public viewing both on TV and online. This bill is primarily written in response to the motion passed by the house to redefine the Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events but this goes further. That list protected sports that are only of importance on a national level and excluded many events important to the nation's of the UK. This list ensures that all matches of the home nations football teams are on free to air TV as well as online. These are important events on the national scale as many of these qualifiers are of huge significance, Scotland v Italy in 2007 and Ireland v Scotland 2015 for example.   Other events of regional importance are included on the list; such as the GAA in Northern Ireland, the Pro12 both in Northern Ireland and Wales and the Welsh national rugby team. In these sports the situation in Northern Ireland and Wales is completely different from Scotland and England. GAA in Northern Ireland and rugby in Wales are the most popular sports by participation, yet most people in the rest of the UK will never have watched hurling. England's regional sport, if you use that terminology is cricket which is also recognised in this bill. The Cricket World Cup final, is for the first time, a protected event in England. More importantly, home Ashes series are also protected, which will no doubt rekindle memories of 2005 for many members of the house. We view this as a compromise with the ECB from the previous position of all home tests, which lead to the removal of the tests in 2006.   Finding a regional sport for Scotland is substantially more difficult. The SPFL, per head of population, is the best supported league on the planet and the only two professional outfits that are not football clubs are Edinburgh and Glasgow rugby. Therefore, due to footballs overwhelming popularity among the Scottish population we have took the decision to include all old firm, that's Celtic v Rangers, matches as protected events but this also has a practical benefit. Crime, violence and disturbances increase dramatically during old firm games across Glasgow and to a lesser extent the rest of Scotland. If people can access these games on their home tv's then they will be discouraged from going to the pub to drink with friends and will instead watch at home were less damage can be done.   Finally, this bill also allows the Prime Minister to designate any other event of their choosing as protected at any point. We expect this to be used for major one-off non-sporting events; such as the future coronation of King Charles III. However, this could also be used if two British teams were playing the the Champions League semi finals for example."
MHOC,3b2fm0,Tim-Sanchez,3,Thu Jun 25 12:45:31 2015 UTC,"If people can access these games on their home tv's then they will be discouraged from going to the pub to drink with friends and will instead watch at home were less damage can be done.    This is a really laughable comment. Events like the FA Cup final or World Cup are aired on freeview and pubs are still absolutely full of people. Most people go to the pub with friends because they enjoy that atmosphere, not because they can't access the game they want at home."
MHOC,3b2fm0,MorganC1,2,Thu Jun 25 17:26:42 2015 UTC,"I still stand by my call to bring the British Grand Prix into the A category for MotoGP alongside the British Grand Prix for Formula 1. The GP is historically one of the most important rounds in the championship and the series itself has very credible international and national support. As well as this, other rounds of the MotoGP series should be categorised as B alongside Formula 1.  Other then this, I have no problems with an otherwise fantastic bill."
MHOC,3b2fm0,Tim-Sanchez,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:15:55 2015 UTC,I don't think the public see MotoGP on the same level as F1. It simply doesn't have the prestige.
MHOC,3b2fm0,mg9500,6,Thu Jun 25 16:24:46 2015 UTC,"But the rugby women's world cup final and great north run is? But the fa cup final doesn't have this prestige in other countries? I must ask why ""prestige"" is used to decide whether the motoGP is included, but vague terms like ""importance"" are used to describe the inclusion of other events. To me, I think there's a lot of inconsistency."
MHOC,3b2fm0,Tim-Sanchez,2,Thu Jun 25 16:55:48 2015 UTC,"Hear hear.  MotoGP is a hugely popular sport, attracting the sponsorship of brands such as Red Bull, Monster, Rockstar, Repsol, Fiat, Phillip Morris and others. The riders are amongst some of the highest paid in the world of sport. Arguing they are not prestigious enough is very much a discredit to their ability."
MHOC,3b2fm0,AlbertDock,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:36:57 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. If he consistently used ""importance"", I could at least understand that these events don't carry the same importance as things like football/rugby/cricket matches. Now he's using ""prestige"" though he's going to have to defend that viewpoint, MotoGP might not be as nationally important as some others on the list but it certainly is a prestigious event."
MHOC,3b2fm0,Tim-Sanchez,2,Thu Jun 25 18:39:45 2015 UTC,MotoGP is neither prestigious or important nationally or regionally.  Women's sport needs some sort of equality in order to grow and the great north run is the biggest mass run in the UK outside of London and is important regionally on Tyneside.
MHOC,3b2fm0,AlbertDock,3,Thu Jun 25 18:39:19 2015 UTC,"MotoGP is neither prestigious   On what basis? It's clearly a prestigious event, though I would agree it is not important. You clearly stated prestige though.   Women's sport needs some sort of equality in order to grow    I agree, though I don't agree with your methods. I think it should be from the grassroots up, encourage participation and attendance at matches. Forcing it to be on national television when it isn't important is far too much far too soon. Let it grow a little first.   he great north run is the biggest mass run in the UK outside of London and is important regionally on Tyneside.   Would you say it is important in Northern Ireland? Since you've put it in the UK-wide list and not the regional list. The Manchester Derby is very important regionally, and the Tyne-Wear derby is important on Tyneside, I don't see them included anywhere on the list.  Your reasoning is heavily inconsistent from one sport to another, which I disagree with. For one sport it's about prestige, for another it's about national importance, for another it's about regional importance, for another it's about equality. In your opening speech you only reference importance, I believe you're changing your argument whenever it suits you rather than having a consistent basis for deciding which sports to include."
MHOC,3b2fm0,Tim-Sanchez,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:53:32 2015 UTC,"I would agree with you that MotoGP should be included, but I would argue that the Great North Run is also important.  There are many who can't afford the trip to London and this gives an alternative for those in northern England and southern Scotland."
MHOC,3b2fm0,AlbertDock,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:02:25 2015 UTC,"Is it so important it should be nationally televised in full? Do people really enjoy sitting through hours of watching people run? I think simply showing crucial parts, such as the start and finish, and dropping in to view it in between are sufficient for national TV. It's the sort of thing that is perfect for online streaming in my opinion, something that piques certain people's interest, allows people to see mum/dad/brother/sister running, but doesn't force a TV channel to show an event that won't garner huge views."
MHOC,3b2fm0,mg9500,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:04:57 2015 UTC,"You must remember that many, particularly elderly people have no idea how to use the internet. So streaming is not an option for them.  The Great North run takes place on a Sunday, and I would argue is not displacing any important programs.  If you look at the program list for any Sunday daytime there's little that could be called quality programming."
MHOC,3b2fm0,GeoSmith16,2,Thu Jun 25 20:39:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's a very strong argument to be honest, internet proficiency is rapidly growing. Neither is the argument it's displacing nothing of value, if that's the case let's force everything into tv on days you deem bad."
MHOC,3b2fm0,Tim-Sanchez,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:47:57 2015 UTC,"While it's true that an ever growing percentage of people can use the internet. But it's worth noting the internet didn't really get going until the mid 1990's, so many over fifty have never used it. This is clear if you look at the number of over fifties who when they have come to claim JSA have been sent on courses to learn to use it. For many pensioners it is something they have done without all their life and will probably never learn to use. If you consider the number of Freeview TV channels, it's hard to believe that room cannot be made for the Great North Run."
MHOC,3b2fm0,Spudgunn,2,Thu Jun 25 21:02:41 2015 UTC,"Another point of note is that cricket has two world cups, one for ODIs and one for Twenty20s.  I'd also argue that all England test matches ought to be in category A (with the Ashes series) on the basis that there is a significant Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi diaspora in the UK, not to mention the fact that these series and series against the likes of New Zealand and South Africa are very popular in themselves."
MHOC,3b2fm0,mg9500,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:19:15 2015 UTC,"The way i treated cricket was with regards to the ECB's 2005 request to remove test matches from list A. I therefore didn't add all of them back, in hope to find a compromise all are happy with.  This is the ODI World Cup. The T20 one is the World T20."

MHOC,3aythp,whigwham,12,Wed Jun 24 16:27:07 2015 UTC,Becoming chair of an independent government commission does not award you your own fiefdom in perpetuity.  /u/Jas1066 did not agree with the brief of the commission and therefore accepted the chair in bad faith. They cannot continue in a role in which they do not believe in in good faith and so ought to have themselves resigned from the post. It is a shame that they lacked the moral rectitude or courage of their convictions to do so and so had to dismissed but unfortunately that was the case. We will not allow avaricious and unprincipled people to cling to power because it looks good to do so.  I continue to have full confidence in the Minster for Education and believe he will bring a better schools system to this country.
MHOC,3aythp,TheQuipton,15,Wed Jun 24 18:29:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, I have bad sense and morals now do I?  Are you really going to try and paint it so that I am in the wrong here? Simply, sir, that is pathetic. As I have said many a time, I see nothing wrong in proposing a slight alteration to the aim of an independent commision, and then once it has been defeated democratically, moving on. Furthermore, and this is something, I realise, that is rare, many members of this house agree with me!  I accepted the chair of the education commision because I thought I could make the children of this country's future better. Even in this episode, I find myself achieving this goal, if only by discrediting you and your corrupted government!"

It's blatantly obvious that his intent was to turn it into a battering ram against the Government. I don't doubt his commitment or his work ethic, which are admirable- but they're better suited to a position within the Opposition than on an independent commission which is supposed to be neutrally advising a department led by someone that Jas has openly declared as one of his enemies.

Also, why on earth does a head of commision require a back bone?   it is something that totally prevents you from discharging your duty.   No it doesn't. Where did you even get that?   It is akin to an army general proposing that instead of defending the country they go into business selling falafel, getting defeated and asking to carry on as general.   No, its much more like an army general suggesting we move a garrison to another location, because he thinks the effectiveness of the forces would be improved, and then when his suggestion is declined, he is willing to go back and work at the original garrison. I see no problem at all with this.   simply stating outright that they were clearly not appropriate as chair of this commission and should have had the decency to resign from the post.   I'm sorry, but if the education commision is supposed to be supported from all political views, you can't just exclude a political view.  Also, I offered to resign.

Poems  against Scotland are good,  and poems that defeat  the French with crossbows.  I don't like poems that  aren't about anything.   Sonnets are wet and   a waste of time.  Also poems that don't  know how to rhyme.  If I was a poem  I'd play football and  get picked for England.  A Good Poem, Roger McGough   But in fact my real favourite is probably Goblin Market by Christina Rossetti, I love her poetry generally and I am particularly fond of narrative poetry."

Although I don't necessarily think that it is a good financial decision (ruling something out entirely is rarely a sound financial decision) it is an imperative moral one.   I'd also point out that the market is what investors make of it, and divestment reduces the value of fossil fuel investment, encouraging other funds to divest in turn. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy that I hope continues to keep the ball rolling on divestment."

MHOC,3aythh,TheQuipton,5,Wed Jun 24 16:57:02 2015 UTC,"Many institutions across the world have investments in companies that exploit fossil fuels, as they are seen as a fairly safe bet for reliable profits (we'll always need energy, right?), including the pension fund that we, parliament, contribute to. Now, with climate change looming over us and the evidence that a significant amount of fossil fuels must stay in the ground to tackle it, it is not morally nor economically justifiable to continue that investment.  There has been a big movement to divest - the opposite of invest - money from fossil fuels, and I think it is vitally important that for once we as politicians lead by example so we are urging parliament to take its money out of the fossil fuel industry just as Norway has done recently and we have been warned to do and put it in sustainable causes."
MHOC,3aythh,ZanderyS,2,Wed Jun 24 18:16:56 2015 UTC,Divesting for climate change? More to do with fossil fuel being no longer profitable with the low cost per barrel and high extraction costs.

MHOC,3aythh,thewriter1,2,Wed Jun 24 19:57:45 2015 UTC,"Mr Deputy Speaker,   While it is not necessarily true that there exists an energy bubble at this time - indeed, increased demand and diminishing supply at a reasonable rate makes carbon based energy a sound investment on the whole - it seems to me there is merit in asking Parliament to consider its pension fund for less destructive investments. This motion has my full support."
MHOC,3aythh,AlbrechtVonRoon,2,Thu Jun 25 07:12:35 2015 UTC,People can invest in what they want. I do agree that there are better investments than fossil fuels (and so do many people) but we cannot make people not invest in them.

MHOC,3at5jx,da_drifter0912,3,Tue Jun 23 16:48:58 2015 UTC,"Some observations, as many parts of this bill seem to me unspecific.   c) New workers will be introduced to their trade union or workers representative on their first day, or the first day they are both present.   Presumably this only applies where there is trade union presence in the workplace?   ii. Where the employee previously worked for an agency and now works directly for an employer, or for another agency the total time working on the same or a broadly similar job will be counted as continuous employment.   I think the definition of a 'broadly similar job' needs tightening. Does that mean the job as in the type of work undertaken, or does the job also have to be at the same employer? I'm not 100% sure what is trying to be said here.   b) Holiday pay shall be calculated on the higher of either the contracted hours, or the actual hours worked.   Surely this would usually be pro rata?   c) No charge will be made for any uniform or corporate clothing.   This obliges therefore businesses to supply uniforms free of charge. There are also taxation implications for this, in that employers will be able to claim back VAT on purchasing these uniforms, which I hope the Secretary of State has accounted for. Furthermore, this definition contains the addition of 'corporate clothing' - does this mean that when I work in the London office and wear a suit that my employer is obliged to pay for it?   a) There will be no fees for any employee submitting a claim to any employment tribunal.   How does the secretary of state plan to deal with spurious claims arising from this?"

MHOC,3at5jx,HaveADream,3,Tue Jun 23 08:37:25 2015 UTC,"Until a few tears ago this position existed. The employer would pay if they were found at fault, otherwise the state would pick up the bill."
MHOC,3at5jx,Duncs11,2,Tue Jun 23 10:32:18 2015 UTC,I apologise on behalf of my honourable friend. The bill states that the employee doesn't pay. By implication the employer has to stump up the money.

The flaw with this is that they could switch agencies if they are doing a poor job and then be difficult to remove even after a couple of days with a new agency  2c) Clarity over this would be good  3) This would lead to an increased number of cases, the fees probably need to be reduced in some respects, but there still needs to be some limit to stop cases that are never going to win."

In essence we have the worst of both worlds, where a school may even be privately funded and the curriculum changed to actively damage the education of children, as we have seen previously with (at the time) almost half of all academies being sponsored by religious organisations pushing a creationist agenda. Academies are also generally widely hated by teachers unions, and have even been slighted by the government itself, which produced a report detailing how 'There is at present no convincing evidence of the impact of academy status on attainment in primary schools.', and that the successes of academies are 'exaggerated'. And on top of all of that, the academy programme is completely riddled with a lack of transparency.  Essentially (if we couple this with the move to stop academy application approval) this bill brings secondary schooling back under governmental control in the long term - this means all teachers will have qualified teacher status, teachers will have better workers rights, local schools will be accountable to the educational authority, and schools will be more fairly funded."

It seems to me that community involvement in and perhaps control of schools is a good idea; so why not simply reform academies instead of being so conservative?   Indeed, using the paper you cited, we can see:   One of the benefits of the expansion of academies has been the opportunity to develop competition between the providers of oversight, support and intervention systems for schools, whether they are academy chains or local authorities. Academy trusts have no legitimacy other than that earned through effective performance in their schools and can be “paused” from expansion or lose schools if they underperform. Whereas there were few if any alternatives to local authority oversight in the past, now a weak education authority knows that it must improve or lose schools from the maintained sector forever. For children, parents and the community it is the quality of education, not the status of the provider which is the measure of success. Too often in the past the democratic mandate of local authorities acted as a protective cloak for failings and excused slow or inadequate intervention. The tension which now exists between the maintained and academy sectors is a healthy one.   As you and your government knows, my primary concern in education is that competition of methods is allowed and even encouraged, particularly and essentially where those methods are state funded. This bill would completely eradicate the very idea of competition, which I do not find to be desirable."

Due to the Revolution that this Government is bringing about in our education system it was necessary when I was made Secretary of State for Education to suspend the application process for new Academies and/or 'free schools'.

Academies have, in some circumstances, proven to fulfil the goals behind them, improving outcomes of all sorts - results, discipline, school safety, schools' role in their community and further life opportunities for pupils. While not suited in all situations, they seem to have a clear role to play in areas with particularly troubled schools - usually those relied on by our least advantaged citizens, mostly with few other options.  As such, it seems foolish to place major obstacles in the way of creating new academies where needed. I would urge the Secretary of State to amend this bill to permit local authorities to open new academies if they see fit, along side new LEA schools."
MHOC,3auaa0,m1cha3lm,2,Thu Jun 25 22:45:26 2015 UTC,"This bill is kinda-sorta redundant, as YOU CAN BUILD SCHOOLS.  Schedule 11 stops state schools from being built if there is no option for an academy. Now, as there is a memorandum from the Secretary of State for Education to stop academies from being built, the only schools that are being built are state schools.  However, doing this to free up potential for academies once again, along side state schools, would be worth the time."
MHOC,3auaa0,theyeatthepoo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:46:27 2015 UTC,There is no memorandum from myself to stop academies being built. I merely paused the application process for new academies.
MHOC,3auaa0,m1cha3lm,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:01:27 2015 UTC,"Fair do's. Thought it was a memorandum, obviously mistaken.  But still, schools can still be built."
MHOC,3auaa0,theyeatthepoo,2,Wed Jun 24 01:52:47 2015 UTC,Yes indeed. But that fact doesn't negate the importance of repealing this section of the Education Act.
MHOC,3auaa0,thedexer102,5,Wed Jun 24 09:05:10 2015 UTC,A new school shouldn't be mandated to be an Academy by law if the Authority does not wish it to be so. This does not prevent the foundation of academies and therefore is only giving more freedom to local authorities to allow them to educate their citizens in the way which is best for them. For this reason I fully support the Bill.

Granted, it's still not super quick, unfortunately it really is the Highland bit that chews up your time - and I can't see it ever making economic sense to run new high speed train lines up to Inverness, given how few people could use it.

There are many who believe the government is too London centric. A new building could ensure every MP gets a seat and an office.  The building could be built with security in mind giving a much more secure place for government to function. The most central place in the country is Dunsop Bridge.

A purpose designed complex could provide much greater security than we have at present. It would give MPs a less London centric view of the country. It would give jobs to a much deprived area. People would be living in an area much less prone to drought. It is one thing to preserve history, it is another to be a Luddite. As times and technology change, the need to keep the Parliament in London decreases. If your really keen on history then Lancaster offers that. Like London it can trace it's history back to Roman times."
MHOC,3ar9b7,RachelChamberlain,3,Tue Jun 23 11:08:57 2015 UTC,"What you argue here is essentially efficiency, or at the very least simple cold hard facts that pay no attention to the hearts of the British people. You cannot just manufacture community and pride, two ideas central to a healthy and cooperative society. If I might quote Robert Louis Stevenson:   It is not so much for its beauty that the forest makes a claim upon men's hearts, as for that subtle something, that quality of the air, that emanation from the old trees, that so wonderfully changes and renews a weary spirit.   This is exactly how great historical landmarks work. I don't know if you have ever visited Parliament, but it is well worth the visit. It is that certain something in the air, emanating from the old wooden panels and the historic benches. The majesty and the glory of the building that renews the weary spirits faith in our system. And it isn't simply the building, as it is not simply the beauty of it. It is the fact that it is living. That these generations today in that Parliament are one of many that have served the country as they see best. We belong to that ancient tradition, a tradition that should only change when great events force it do so (such as devastation from war), not when someone gets a little tired of travel arrangements.  I might add that by moving Parliament, some people would lose their jobs. We would also have to move the entirity of Whitehall. I mean think about it for one second, if we must argue on the issues of cold hard materialism, where the power of money and of money alone dominates. The executive must converse with itself and with the legislature. As such, unless we were to move it to a city very close to London (which would be pointless considering your argument), all the machinery of state would have to be dropped on some poor unsuspecting city.  One option that has been bandied around if York, my beloved city, centre of God's own county, and notably greater than that awful Lancaster (which may have roots in Roman times, but Parliament wasn't built there, nor were the Romans British or English). I would likely fall into the greatest despair if suddenly new buildings began to dominate the medieval skyline of York. These buildings would likely not be built to match that skyline (a skyline that has been heavily protected, thank God), but rather would be ripped apart by buildings designed for simple and efficient purposes, purposes such as security, without any heart or sole. A further degredation of our shared pride and memory.  It is one thing to want to improve our affairs, it is another to be an uncaring fool.  Parliament represents so many things. It is not just aesthetic, or tradition, but that certain something in the air. It is the melding of many different factors that make it our Parliament, and give us a groundedness that prevent us from losing sight of our humaness. We are not machines, and we should not build our cities or our governance on that basis. Truly AlbertDock, you are a disgrace to this nation if you honestly think that we should promote a machine like brain over a human heart (and a British heart at that)."

MHOC,3ar9b7,AlbertDock,2,Tue Jun 23 12:00:01 2015 UTC,"I am not suggesting that the Palace of Westminster be demolished, more that it's use has changed. It could become a tourist attraction and museum, much the same way as the Tower of London has.  No one in their right mind would suggest that that is not a suitable use for the Tower.  It is a case of moving with the times. All new things need time to become part of the scenery, I have little doubt that when the Tower of London was built by William the locals did not like it. Now though demolishing the Tower would be unthinkable.  We don't expect anyone to live in a slum, because their is a history of people in slums. We don't send children down the mines, because it was tradition. Traddition is good in many ways, but it cannot be used as an excuse to hold back progress."
MHOC,3ar9b7,SPQR1776,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:11:56 2015 UTC,"I fear that you have completely failed to read my post. I did not suggest that you wanted to demolish Parliament. The fact is, Parliament works. It needs some renovation, but this is hardly comparable to slums.   My position isn't simply about tradition, it is about a real romantic attachment, and trying to build society on that basis. A cruel mechanical system that you ask for is terrible. Society has not developed in such a manner that it now demands new residence for our Parliament.   The Tower was built at a time when the feudal system dominated, a system designed for warlike purposes. But, civil pursuits soon took dominance, and warfare changed to make castles less necessary. Therefore, our monarch needed new residence.   No such major development has taken place that gives rise to moving Parliament out of London or out of Westminster. On a temporary basis it is fine, considering the renovation work that needs doing. But any permanent move is sheer stupidity and heartlessness. I have addressed the latter, but actually think for one second about the former. London isn't geographically central, but it may come as a surprise that transport doesn't always take that into consideration. London is the central hub of the UK and to an extent of the world, containing as it does the busiest airport in the world. This is not to mention its exceptional underground system and train system.  We would not just be moving Parliament, we would also be moving the Government.

MHOC,3aqa8u,HaveADream,5,Mon Jun 22 17:27:53 2015 UTC,"I believe the Prime Minister answered a question similar to this a few days ago. A fair amount of legislation will be put to the house soon, in many cases joint projects between my department and DEFRA, that is either on the spreadsheet now or will be shortly - I advise the honourable member to keep an eye on that for details. You will see a motion of my own regarding the very important matter of divestment very soon. The matters dealt with by DECC rarely suit themselves to bills mind you, we will make our most significant progress with the budget.  I must say though that it is the duty of the entire house to write legislation, not just us! I don't want people to sit back and wait for that Green lot to do all the environmental stuff, I recognise the key attention other parties give to preserving our planet and I'd love to see that talk backed up by bills too!"

MHOC,3aqa8u,InfernoPlato,4,Mon Jun 22 17:39:21 2015 UTC,Absolutely!

The orginial discussions were somewhat hampered by them coming at a very bad time with myself and a couple of other members of our delegation and others away with exams which, coupled with a few no-shows from the UK delegation, slowed progress down considerably.  I am pleased to say that for the past few days we have been trying very hard to rectify this and are spending a lot of time discussing how we can go forward with amendments to the treaty to make sure it is perfect before bringing it back to this house. Nothing short of perfect is acceptable in matters of these importance."

Why should the PM refuse to take the actual relevant ministers that will be enacting the changes talked about and replace them with token members of other parties?   I would have suggested PM, 2 Govt, 2 Opp, 1 UnOpp in order to ensure that the delegation is more representative. Is there something wrong with that?  A more representative delegation would mean that a treaty has more chance of representing the population - I hardly see that as something being bad.   It's a shame party politics is being put ahead of doing the right thing   Eh, it's not party politics. Is more like ensuring that our views are heard and that we represent the population which voted for us. The Opposition gained over 40 seats yet those who voted for us have their views in the talks count for less. I consider that unfair.   if you ask me the best people for the job were taken and a diverse range of views were given.   I would argue differently if I could but I can't since I wasn't there.

MHOC,3aqa8u,UnderwoodF,3,Mon Jun 22 18:52:44 2015 UTC,"The Prime Minister picked the best people for the job such that the delegation included people from a variety of government departments (economic minded and environmentalists) and with a variety of talents, whilst ensuring that he had representatives of members from across the house and with different ideologies to ensure more variety in our message and prevented an echo chamber (with which your faith in Jamman is well placed). The exact parties they came from was a secondary priority and I think /u/whigwham had every right to make that decision, but you're welcome to take that up with him if you really care about it that much."

MHOC,3aqa8u,GhoulishBulld0g,3,Mon Jun 22 20:05:18 2015 UTC,"I won't rule out anything as we'll have to take a closer look at the reserves we have, the relative economic benefits and costs of extracting them and whether we can cope with the environmental damage they will cause, but of course in an ideal world diddly squat. Fracking is quite rightly illegal so that certainly won't be an option under this government and I certainly don't believe fixing us into more extraction of fossil fuels in the medium term is at all sensible when we have such a great capacity for renewables. I hope the answer is a resounding no, but I'll leave you in hope that your thirst for sucking the last juice out of the crying Earth won't be denied just yet."
MHOC,3aqa8u,GhoulishBulld0g,2,Mon Jun 22 20:25:02 2015 UTC,"What will you be doing to help the Scottish Oil & Gas sector recover, yet, attempting to make the UK closer to carbon neutral?"

MHOC,3aqa8u,SeyStone,5,Mon Jun 22 18:58:40 2015 UTC,"Any government has many priorities of course and it's not fair to say that fixing scathing inequality or getting people out of poverty or providing the highest quality healthcare or giving workers and all citizens back their rights or empowering our citizens or anything else is any less important than the next item of the government's agenda but in my opinion yes, it is absolutely the top of my priorities and any government that doesn't place it at the top of its priority list is failing its people."

MHOC,3aqa8u,peter199,2,Mon Jun 22 20:14:18 2015 UTC,Will the Secretary accept that the public do not want onshore wind turbines on greenbelt land?
MHOC,3aqa8u,bgpk,6,Mon Jun 22 17:35:51 2015 UTC,"No, I will not accept ideological opposition to something that is well supported, cheap and will prevent devastation of our planet.  DECC in real life did a public attitude survey regarding onshore wind just a few months ago finding that support for onshore wind has risen to 68% with total opposition falling to a record low of just 10%. Why on earth would I think the public don't want it?  A lot of our wind power in the future will be centred on Scotland where the potential is huge, and support there is even higher at around 78%.  Will UKIP accept that the public do want a cleaner, more secure future?"
MHOC,3aqa8u,GeoSmith16,3,Mon Jun 22 18:04:15 2015 UTC,"I will not accept ideological opposition   Not quite ideological opposition really, since those who oppose them tend to oppose them on the basis of their aesthetics.    Will UKIP accept that the public do want a cleaner, more secure future?   While I can't speak for UKIP, they shouldn't. The YouGov Poll from May this year showed a combined total of 48% of respondents who don't wish to see any encouragement for new wind farms, compared to 37% in favour.   I think the greater scandal in this regard is actually the subsidies who go to often incredibly wealthy land owners in exchange for building these wind turbines, when the cost is added onto the bills of some of the poorest in society."
MHOC,3aqa8u,GeoSmith16,4,Mon Jun 22 18:43:12 2015 UTC,"I quoted government sources, you quote an online poll that is unreliable at best. We can quote numbers that reinforce our pre-set viewpoint all day long though, let's not waste our time and accept that opinions vary. Like I say in the areas we're particularly looking at putting wind farms support is pretty high.  I find your final remark fascinating coming from a party that supports the huge public assistance of nuclear, fracking and all manner of fossil fuel extraction, distorting the markets far, far more. Wind is the cheapest form of low-carbon energy whereas nuclear power plants have never been built without huge government subsidies inevitably leading to a loss to the taxpayer.  I don't wish to see wealthy land owners profit out of public money, if I did I'd hand in the right to call myself a socialist right this minute, but I firmly support giving people the opportunity to use the free, infinite resources the Earth provides us with. While this government is in office the poorest in society being hit by the cost of energy will be a thing of the past, what with the Green Buildings Act, for example, all but eliminating fuel poverty. Not to mention of course that wind is a far better investment than the Tories' nuclear pet projects and beloved fossil fuels."
MHOC,3aqa8u,akc8,2,Mon Jun 22 19:22:06 2015 UTC,"I quoted government sources, you quote an online poll that is unreliable at best.    YouGov is unreliable now? Seriously?   Like I say in the areas we're particularly looking at putting wind farms support is pretty high.   Well, you can say it all you like, it doesn't make it true.    I find your final remark fascinating coming from a party that supports the huge public assistance of nuclear, fracking and all manner of fossil fuel extraction, distorting the markets far, far more   How exactly are we distorting the market for energy?   I don't wish to see wealthy land owners profit out of public money, if I did I'd hand in the right to call myself a socialist right this minute, but I firmly support giving people the opportunity to use the free, infinite resources the Earth provides us with   Well you do, because you're defending a policy in which wealthy land owners gain directly at the expense of the poor. Some examples, perhaps?   It comes as Sir Reginald Sheffield, David Cameron's father-in-law, whose baronetcy was created in the mid 18th century, admitted last week he earns as much as £350,000 a year from eight turbines on his estate at Bagmoor in Lincolnshire.   The Duke of Roxburghe has angered locals – including the neighbouring Duke of Northumberland – after winning a lengthy planning and legal battle to build 48 turbines, each about 400ft high, on unspoilt moorland in the Scottish borders.  The Duke, who is worth about £100 million, will reportedly earn as much as £2.5 million a year from the deal although a spokesman, who declined to discuss the actual amount, said that figure was not accurate.   The Earl of Seafield, who owns over 100,000 acres making him Britain's seventh largest landowner, has eight turbines on his land in Banffshire generating rental income in the region of £120,000 while the Earl of Moray receives, according to one industry expert, in excess of half a million pounds a year from 36 turbines near Stirling in Scotland.     And the list goes on and on...   I firmly support giving people the opportunity to use the free, infinite resources the Earth provides us with   That's all very well. But tax revenue, that could have been used to build vital schools and hospitals, used to subsidise these land owners in exchange for the wind farms you seek to defend, is not ""infinite"". Hell, the pockets of the 2.5 million households in England living under Fuel Poverty is not ""infinite"" (By the way those are Government figures, not the infamous and unreliable YouGov), yet you seek to condemn them to higher energy bills under the pretence of a ""more secure future"". Who is this ""secure future"" for, exactly?   The poorest and most vulnerable in our society, or the landed gentry who benefit from millions of pounds in subsidy?"

I'm not going to mince my words on this, or hide behind anybody else, or apologise to anybody for writing this bill. I'm not going to apologise for improving the quality of life for thousands of women, especially in Northern Ireland. Women who would otherwise be forced into all kinds of trauma had this bill not passed. I may be hated in Northern Ireland for this now, but I am not hated by the many people in Northern Ireland that this bill has helped and will help.  Mr Speaker, I must strongly condemn these hypocrites who believe that the best way to combat what they perceive as killing is to threaten to actually kill those who had near to no part in it. The current Health Secretary, /u/DrNyan, was not even an MP when this bill was passed, and others targeted had no part in the bill other than voting for it, and I trust that none of the other 55 MPs who did vote for it will give in to such caveman tactics by apologising.  I recommend that we redouble security on all 56 MPs and former MPs that voted for the bill and their families, especially those that played integral roles in the bill's passing, and those who have been named in threats. I also recommend that we use police forces to find and arrest those who made these death threats."

It's just a fact that most people with uteruses are women, and the policy surrounding reproductive rights regarding people with uteruses is stained by gender politics and thus the patriarchy"
MHOC,3amomv,WineRedPsy,8,Sun Jun 21 23:12:58 2015 UTC,"i would like to remind /u/Jas1066 that men having a abortion is physically impossible.  You can freely do a Organ Donation, but you could not do a Abortion before that bill in Northern Ireland. A Socio-Economic structure which is inherently sexist (Some Positions (Pope) can only be Men, anyone?) is promoting these ideas which restrict a human right. banning abortion is like banning Condoms because some weird club in London wants it.  It's all part of the Patriarchal structure which is still deeply routed in this society.   and just for your information, quoting wikipedia ""Feminism: the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men."""

That is central to the very idea of equality.   You did not just say that “this is not “the patriarchy’s fault”, you also said “It is absolutely not a suppression of rights to ban abortion.” It is. This isn’t anyone’s opinion, this is a statement of fact, as outlined in my previous statement. A ban on abortion IS a suppression of the rights of women. Perhaps you would like to rephrase your statement as “The right to abortion should not exist”, which is an argument that has already been had in this house, and resulted in the passing of B076, so there is no point in us having it again here.  This is the first time in my life I have ever been called a feminist, and all it took was an acknowledgement of the law. If all it takes to be a feminist is a respect for the longstanding legal protections in place for women then the future of feminism is bright indeed!"

Are they now a male or female in your eyes?   this is a statement of fact,   Ha, I laugh at your facts.   A ban on abortion IS a suppression of the rights of women. Perhaps you would like to rephrase your statement as “The right to abortion should not exist”,   This is why I hate ""rights"". In my eyes, the legislative has no power over rights.

Which is to say, a pregnant person, whether they identify as male, female or otherwise, should, of course, have the same right to abortion as any other pregnant person, within the law. I thought I had been clear on that point.  It is a shame that you choose to laugh at facts, because they tend to be true whether you laugh at them or no.   And who determines what rights God has bestowed upon people? And which god gets precedence? A person’s faith can determine their own views on right and wrong, but in a democratic system those views cannot be foisted upon the people. All of our rights ultimately stem from the will of the rest of society, who elect representatives, who pass legislation. If you don’t believe in this system to protect people’s rights, why are you here?  To use an analogy, a vegetarian is entirely entitled to believe, through religious or any other means, that “Meat is Murder”, but it is up to the whole of society to decide if anyone does life for it."

To use an analogy, a vegetarian is entirely entitled to believe, through religious or any other means, that “Meat is Murder”, but it is up to the whole of society to decide if anyone does life for it.

Trying to paint it as some secret deal is absurd, he asked them what it would need for them to support the bill, and made the amendments to the bill, that he and the other TLC parties were more then happy with.   Secondly, your party would be utter hypocrites for attacking others for doing what Jack did, as you have done it on multiple occasions.   Thirdly, trying to dismiss MPs as ""inactive"" is cheap and a weak argument. All MPs are elected by the electorate, and even MPs vote counts equally, it doesn't matter about it you deem them inactive.

It's not like you have any rights against slavery or something.   I should be protected from slavery by the law. Whether that is my right or not is another matter.   Your way to end it would be, the moment islamists would bomb us or something, immideatly declare a caliphate in favour of the islamists.   Wut?"
MHOC,3amomv,AlbrechtVonRoon,2,Mon Jun 22 16:40:08 2015 UTC,"I hate the very concept of rights   Depends on what you mean. If you mean so-called universal rights then I absolutely agree with you. But, we do have rights as a result of belonging to this great nation of ours, but they are natural and ancient, not artificial as the left would impose on us."
MHOC,3amomv,Jas1066,2,Sun Jun 21 23:03:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly, as you say. I feel ""rights"" have lost their meaning. Its a sad day when just because the law says you can have an abortion, it becomes your ""right"" to have one. I should have clarified."
MHOC,3amomv,sZjLsFtA,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:29:46 2015 UTC,Which rights are natural? Surely they were all imposed at one time or another?
MHOC,3amomv,AlbrechtVonRoon,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:15:27 2015 UTC,"That depends on the time and the place.

MHOC,3amomv,Jas1066,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:01:39 2015 UTC,"I would say that 1+1=3 is a thoroughly more ridiculous statement than declining to accept ""laws"" as rights."
MHOC,3amomv,bnzss,6,Mon Jun 22 16:30:59 2015 UTC,I urge my honourable friend to keep his silence if all he desires to speak is pointless and inflammatory.   The content of the act is less important than what is being done right now to oppose it. That some members of this House are choosing to advertise a legitimate opposition to the act in question as a result of this violence is simply absurd.
MHOC,3amomv,Jas1066,2,Sun Jun 21 21:06:38 2015 UTC,I hear my right honorable friend's advice and respectfully ignore it. Those who passed it were reckless and should accept that this is a direct result of their actions.

It may be noble, ""right"" even, but it is still foolish. The honorable accept the outcomes of their actions, and take the blame. What happened in this house when the Bill in question was passed may have been the right thing to do, in your opinion, but you must still see that it was you who brought this on.  I do hope the right honorable gentleman grows up and takes responsibility for his actions."

Even if we look at the votes that parties received, simplifying the parties to how the majority of their MPs voted (which in itself doesn't take into account the 4 UKIP MPs and 2 Tory MPs that voted in favor), it is clear that a overwhelming majority of MHoC Northern Ireland Voters voted for parties that support abortion.  Parties who voted majority for: 28 votes (70%) Comm: 16 (40%) CWL: 9 (23%) Labour: 1 (3%) LibDem: 2 (5%)  Parties who voted majority against: 12 votes (30%) BIP: 3 (8%) Tory: 3 (8%) UKIP: 6 (15%)  Ontop of that, these is nothing forced about this at all, if the people of Northern Ireland want to override the bill, they can use the Direct Democracy Act to force a referendum on the issue."

This had nothing to do with ideology, it is about the rights of women, and giving women access to abortion. The only ideology here is that of the extremists.   It is not ""silly"" to give women access to abortion, and your suggestion that it is, is absolutely disgusting. The rights of citizens of this country are not ""silly""  Your entire argument is absurd, and you are wanting us to appease these terrorists just like politicians in the 30's tried to appease Hitler. We should not cave, and allow these terrorists to win. And the existence of cowards like you hold back progress, and fuel extremists.  If we listened to you, and appeased these terrorists, then we would just fuel them further, and would send a message to them, that ""if you threaten the British house of commons, they would cower and surrender at the first hurdle"""

MHOC,3ahoou,NoPyroNoParty,8,Sat Jun 20 07:24:23 2015 UTC,"Flexible Working Contracts 2015  A bill to replace Zero Hour Contracts with Flexible Working Contracts, designed to be an alternative to regular working contracts.  BE IT ENACTED by The Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, in accordance with the provisions of the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—  Part I - Definitions  Zero Hours Contracts   A Zero Hours Contract is name of a form of contract that is replaced by Flexible Working Contracts. The contract is a contract or agreement for the supply of labour which has no specified working hours and satisfies the following feature:   The contract would require the worker to be available for work as such times when there is not a guarantee that the worker is required for work.    Regular Working Contracts   A Regular Working Contract is any form of contract of employment that specifies working hours.   Flexible Working Contracts   A Flexible Working Contract is a contract or agreement for the supply of labour which does not specify working hours. In order to enter a Flexible Working Contract, one of the following clauses must be satisfied:   The contract requires the worker to be unable to commit to a Regular Working Contract. The contract was specifically requested by the employee due to commitments making regular work impractical.    Part II - Amendments and Repeals  Zero Hours Contract Bill 2015   The Zero Hours Contract Bill 2015 is repealed in its entirety.    The appropriate sections have been recreated here in order to maintain clarity.    Working Regulations Bill 2014   The Working Regulations Bill 2014 is repealed in its entirety, with relevant and unaffected sections being recreated here for clarity and continuation.   Part 1, Section 1, Definition of Normal Working Hours, has been recreated in Part 1, Section 2 of this bill, Definition of Regular Working Contracts. Part 2, Enhanced Pay Rates, has been recreated in Part 3 of this bill. Part 3, Effects on Benefits, has been amended and recreated in Part 8 of this bill. Part 5, Fining of Employers, has been amended and recreated in Part 7 of this bill.    Part III - Enhanced Pay Rates  The employer is obligated to pay an enhanced rate for time worked above:   One and a half times the contracted rate of hours. Forty Hours. The employer is to pay this rate for whichever of the above clauses comes first.   This rate is to stand at:   One and a half times the contracted pay for eight hours. Double the contracted pay for any subsequent hours.   Part IV - Prohibition of Zero Hours Contracts.   Zero Hours Contracts, from the commencement of this bill are prohibited. All Zero Hours Contracts must be replaced by Regular Working Contracts or Flexible Working Contracts.   This is in accordance to the regulations set out in Parts I and IV of this bill.    Part V - Use of Flexible Working Contracts  The use of Flexible Working Contracts as a form of mainstream employment, as under Zero Hours Contracts is prohibited. As such:  All employees have the right to a Regular Working Contract. Under no circumstances may the employer offer a Flexible Working Contract as its primary contract of employment.  From the commencement of this bill, all employers are legally bound to offer employees working on Zero Hours Contracts a Regular Working Contract.  Any employee wishing to work under a Flexible Working Contract has the right to request this from the employer. However, the employer may not request a Flexible Working Contract from the employee.   Any employee wishing to continue with their current employment contract agreement may request for their Zero Hours Contract to be terminated and a Flexible Working Contract to be established. Under no circumstances may the employer request that any employee currently working on a Zero Hours Contract moves to a Flexible Working Contract. The insertion of exclusivity clauses within Flexible Working Contracts is prohibited. Under no circumstances will an exclusivity clause be legally binding.    Employees working on a Flexible Working Contract are legally entitled to be paid for all hours:   Spent providing labour as agreed in the Contract of Employment. Spent available at or near a place of work for the purpose of doing time work and being required to be available for work.   For the purpose of this bill, this clause is to be referred to as the employee being ‘on call’.  This is in accordance with the National Minimum Wage Act of 1998.   Part VI - Accountability of Flexible Working Contracts  Flexible Working Contracts are to be considered a contract of employment, as stated in the Employment Rights Act 1996. As such:   Flexible Working Contracts are subject to the Employment Rights Act 1996, Part XIV, Chapter III Section 230.   They will be accountable as a ‘contract of employment’. (Employment Rights Act 1996, Part XIV, Chapter III Section 230-2.  This holds them accountable to the same employment laws as Regular Working Contracts, unless stated otherwise in this bill.   This also holds them accountable to any further employment laws or otherwise stated in this bill.    The Employer of a Flexible Working Contract agreement is responsible for:   Tax and National Insurance Ensuring that the worker has the right to work in the United Kingdom. Ensuring that the worker is familiar with all relevant Health and Safety procedure including, but not limited to, evacuation of the building, reporting of health and safety issues, the procedure in case of any spills of chemicals, and first aid arrangements. Providing all personal protective equipment.   Part VII - Breach of Regulations.  In the event of any employer breaking any of the relevant regulations set out in Parts III, IV, V and VI of this bill, a fine of £5,000 per employee up to no limit may be enforced.  Part VIII - Effects on Benefits  No person shall have their benefits reduced for refusing an offer of work:   Where the offer was a Flexible Working Contract. Where the offer was a Regular Working Contract and the guaranteed hours on offer were less than 20 hours.   Part IX - Interpretation  For the purposes of this bill:   Employees are anybody supplying labour under an contract of employment. An employer is anybody supplying a contract of employment in return for the supply of labour. An exclusivity clause is a clause within a contract that would require an employee to work for one employee only.   Part X - Final Provisions  Commencement   This act will come into commencement on the 1st September, 2015.   Extent   This act extends to the entire United Kingdom, consisting of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Island.   Short Title   This bill may be cited as the Flexible Working Contracts Bill 2015."

MHOC,3ahoou,bnzss,7,Mon Jun 22 08:06:07 2015 UTC,"Two things.  First, if this bill is enacted, I kid you not, it would force the retail store that I work at to close. I'd love to not be on minimum wage, but I love having a job more.  Second, I am currently contracted for 4 hours a week, but work anything up to 30 hours a week, meaning I will be paid excessively undeservedly. This will force the firm I work for to increase the number of hours on my contract, which they won't need me for when the changes in seasons hurt our business.  This bill will have serious issues, and will hamper this alledged ""small business revolution"" that the Conservatives keep referring to."
MHOC,3ahoou,Kipper_the_snob,4,Sat Jun 20 09:28:27 2015 UTC,"First, if this bill is enacted, I kid you not, it would force the retail store that I work at to close   No, it would not.  The firm has two options:  a) Hire more staff to fill the gaps.  This will not increase costs for the firm noticeably, as the total number of hours worked will remain unchanged.  b) Increase the number of contracted hours, as you noticed.    However, these are not mutually exclusive.  It is likely the majority of firms will utilise a combination of these, meaning that more people will get into (admittedly limited) work, while those who wish to work more hours will get more hours.  Additionally, it will increase labour market flexibility on the supplying side, which should generally lead to positive outcomes."
MHOC,3ahoou,Zoto888,2,Sun Jun 21 12:51:41 2015 UTC,"None of this applies to those firms whose required man hours are unknown or otherwise difficult to predict. Which means this:   This will not increase costs for the firm noticeably   Will simply not be true. Either costs rise because too many hours are contracted, or revenue falls because not enough staff are working. There is a chance of hitting a sweet spot, but I reckon an employer, if he knows the required man hours over the forthcoming weeks, would already have that in-hand.  And:   Additionally, it will increase labour market flexibility on the supplying side, which should generally lead to positive outcomes.   While I see what you're saying, this is tenuous at best.  I feel that when this House seeks to reform 'zero hours contracts' it needs to consider that in at least some cases the employer has a legitimate concern in terms of how many hours will actually be available to work. The automatic assumption appears to be that the employer wants to make his employees' lives difficult, which is largely incorrect."
MHOC,3ahoou,bnzss,2,Mon Jun 22 08:09:30 2015 UTC,"Before I continue, I acknowledge that for some firms this will be possible, but this won't be unilateral. Continuing to use the firm I work for as a case study, hiring more people won't be possible. We recently hired around 20 new people, so hiring even more would be impossible. I know, that following neo-classical economic theory, one would expect to see this improve the quality of labour and increase the level of marginal revenue product per unit of labour, due to each worker competing for hours by improving their employability and skills. In practice however, this does not occur. New employees aren't given enough hours, meaning they don't develop skills quick enough and are a drain of the stores resources. Existing employees also now see themselves receiving less hours, which creates anger towards management as well as with the new employees. This worsens the level of co-operation between staff, lowering productivity and causing employees marginal product to full i.e. the law of diminishing returns. Although in the long run (perhaps 3 or 4 months) these issues will become resolved, but for a retail store that has differing levels of business on a seasonal basis, this is quite a cost. Therefore, it isn't just as simple as ""hire more staff"".  Whilst I believe in the firm being able to have a flexible internal labour market, there needs to be a level of moderation. I do also accept that this is just one example, and that for other firms this is unlikely to be true, but it's something to bear in mind."
MHOC,3ahoou,Kipper_the_snob,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:07:52 2015 UTC,"During the second reading of this bill, I have provided a clause in order to allow issues such as mixed contractual issues to be negotiated into Flexible Working Contracts. The aim of this bill is to provide the utmost satisfaction and security to workers and I can see that such a clause could be beneficial to employees.  The primary objective of this bill is to prevent the mass unregulated use of Flexible Working Contracts, or Zero Hours Contracts as the use of primary employment for many large businesses."
MHOC,3ahoou,MorganC1,3,Tue Jun 23 22:30:24 2015 UTC,This bill takes away some of the rights workers have under the Working Regulations Act 2014 specifically as follows:.. Casual workers (typically those working for a few days) previously had an extra 10% to make up for the fact that claiming holiday pay was particularly difficult.  They have lost this right.   Will you reinstate this provision?
MHOC,3ahoou,AlbertDock,2,Sat Jun 20 11:18:39 2015 UTC,"Should the bill be taken to a second reading, I will amend it to include such rights. It was not my intention to strip workers of these rights, rather empower them."
MHOC,3ahoou,MorganC1,3,Sun Jun 21 00:09:53 2015 UTC,"Mr Deputy Speaker,   I'm having trouble understanding the advantages of this bill over previous legislation. It seems to me this would serve as something of a disincentive for employers to recruit the kind of staff would would previously been on a zero hours contract, particularly because of the additions of 'on call' pay and enhanced pay rates. And those companies in volatile industries (e.g. Seasonal or weather dependent) will simply be unable to offer these kinds of terms.   In fact the on call provision is most bizarre. How would that actually work? What problem does it try to fix?"
MHOC,3ahoou,bnzss,3,Sat Jun 20 09:45:32 2015 UTC,"With no opening speech, I presume somebody from the government will tell me why we should vote for this bill and what it aims to fix."

MHOC,3afmbf,NoPyroNoParty,6,Fri Jun 19 19:08:41 2015 UTC,"A few changes Mr Deputy Speaker, all of which following suggestions by members from across the house in the first reading, and I've taken the liberty to highlight these in red.    Fans' representitives on boards of clubs must now be elected democratically by their members (thanks /u/jas1066).  Changing protected parts of a club's identity must now be approved by a survey of every season ticket holder (thanks /u/jas1066) but exceptions have been made for where clubs are forced to change these by local authorities for example (thanks /u/Tim-Sanchez).  More of the income from the windfall tax has been directed towards redistribution to lower leagues and grassroots level which I feel is a fairer and more pragmatic use of all that money, whilst recognising the need for a dedicated fund for supporter ownership.  Home ticket prices for clubs below the Championship are not capped for now as they are rarely as excessively extortionate as the top leagues and these clubs - the majority of which are significantly struggling financially - rely far more heavily on ticket revenue. Away tickets remain capped as the average cost of an away day even in these leagues regularly exceeds £100, sometimes £200, and it is crucial that we ensure that these experiences are open to all and the next generation of supporters are not lost to the enticing light of the television screen (thanks /u/treeman1221).  The initial limit on increasing the price cap each year is set to the current inflation rate and the fine for breaching the cap is the extra revenue gained plus 10% to ensure that clubs do not cut their losses and intentionally exceed it (thanks /u/Tim-Sanchez).    Section 6 is an entirely new one, and is following a suggestion by /u/GeordieFaithful and demand from a great number of fans across the country. Currently football fans, unlike rugby or cricket fans or football fans in any other country, are banned from drinking alcohol within sight of the pitch. As the honourable member says:   After all we're no longer in the 70s or 80s and the majority of trouble caused around matches is by fans who are not attending the game, they have open access to the finest local water supply in pubs and bars throughout the matches.   As it stands fans are allowed to drink all they like outside the ground before the game and cause trouble then enter the ground rowdily or drink as much as they can in the quickest time possible during half time because they cannot in the arena itself, rather than having a controlled drink in the stadium where fans are together and can be controlled. Not to mention the revenue that many lower leagues desperately need that is being taken from them due to this draconian ban.  This legislation does have some benefits in big games where trouble can reasonably be expected, but a system where the ban could be applied by local authorities to perceived high-risk games on a case-by-case basis would be better and avoid stigmatising football supporters generally for the actions of a minority.  I read a fantastic article in When Saturday Comes not long ago explaining the case for this very well.  Now as I am aware of the uncertainty of it, the planning that has to go into this and the scale of the matter I have decided not to change the legislation now but simply to run some trials over the next season to assertain whether it is a feasible option and gain valuable feedback on which to go forward in future.    I hope these minor additions meet the approval of the house and we can get one step closer to finally fixing the many ills of the beautiful game.  /u/NoPyroNoParty"

MHOC,3ab3qw,TheQuipton,5,Thu Jun 18 18:17:33 2015 UTC,"'Leaving NATO' is not in the coalition agreement. In fact, iirc there's nothing about NATO in the coalition agreement. Which means that the plan is to keep the status quo. As you might be aware, the more centrist members of our party want to stay, while the more leftist members want to leave - we hence decided to keep the status quo. That it's not mentioned at all in the coalition agreement should prove that we were planning to keep the status quo. We're not going to list all of the things which we aren't going to change or we'll be here forever.  Not only that, you were told several times in the reading that we had no plans to leave, hence making the vote a complete waste of time."

I hope the Prime Minister's statement on this motion's passing will address our concerns and not cast them aside as seemingly most others are Government are happy doing, on the basis that ""We've already done it"" things have changed since you have already done it including Defence spending dropping below 2% GDP.

My point was that if we are attacked it will be one of our overseas territories, not our mainland. Thus NATO does not come in to play.  I do not see Russia as a threat to the British Mainland, to think they would invade us is a simply ludicrous notion. This brings us onto the fact that if NATO expands further east, into nations that do not have sensible or stable governance, then those nations could handle Russia very badly and provoke a war engulfing all of NATO.   In fact NATO and the west has done nothing but provoke Russia from the start, after Russia reclaimed what was rightfully Russian soil.  To prevent unnecessary bloodshed and the loss of British fathers for an unjust cause we should leave NATO."

The homeless present a complex problem, and the idea that people trying to keep them of their front door is an act of cruelty is just silly. We need to address the homeless problem, and this is not the way to do it, and through this way we harm the beauty of our cities and the safety of our neighbourhoods."
MHOC,3a74yl,AlbrechtVonRoon,8,Sat Jun 20 14:10:05 2015 UTC,"I really can't understand why anyone is getting worked up over property rights over this. All it means is that people can't build spikes such as these in their doorway if said doorway faces the street. You're still allowed to chase the homeless away, you're still allowed to build a fence stopping them from coming near your house if you so wish. All this bill really ensures is that those living in the most miserable conditions our society has to offer can gain some protection from the elements at the front of blocks of flats, and commercial buildings."
MHOC,3a74yl,bleepbloop12345,8,Wed Jun 17 20:14:24 2015 UTC,"Because this section:   (1) Structures determined to be hostile on private property should be removed by 1st October 2015.   forces homeowners to get rid of structures deemed hostile. It's forcing owners to change their homes and gardens for no purpose since, as you said, homeless people should not be anywhere in private property unless permission is given."
MHOC,3a74yl,InfernoPlato,3,Wed Jun 17 20:38:41 2015 UTC,"Right, but that clause is only referring to what is defined in section 1 as ""hostile architecture"", i.e.   (1) “Hostile architecture” will be defined as any public bench or ledge designed with the intention of being unable to be slept on.  (3) This definition will also extend to cover anti-homeless spikes built on both public property and in doorways facing the street on private property.   That means that people will only have to remove spikes in their doorway if their doorway faces the street, which is an incredibly minor change."
MHOC,3a74yl,bleepbloop12345,2,Wed Jun 17 21:06:17 2015 UTC,"I'll concede that I must have messed up when reading.   3.(1) implies that it is a structure instead of anti-homeless spikes which aren't at all similar to benches. The current definitions are very unclear at a glance.  I would recommend that you amend 1.(2) to:   (2) ""Anti-homeless spikes"" will be defined as thin, pointed pieces of rigid material which are built on both public property and in doorways facing the street on private property.   Changing 2   (1) Hostile Architecture should be removed by 1st August 2015.  (2) Anti-homeless spikes on public property should be removed by 1st August 2015.  (3) These should be replaced by structures to be used for the same purpose as the original structure, but non-hostile. The replacement should occur before 1st September 2015.  (4) If these structures cannot be replaced in a way which is non-hostile, such as in the case of anti-homeless spikes, the structure will be removed, but not replaced.   and then changing 3.(1) to:   (1) Anti-homeless spikes on private property should be removed by 1st October 2015   This is all an effort to make it clearer and to stop others from making the same mistake I did when reading."
MHOC,3a74yl,InfernoPlato,3,Wed Jun 17 21:37:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd agree with all of that and I'd certainly recommend to /u/spqr1776  that those changes are added to it, or at least changes along those lines. I guess this sort of thing is why we have multiple readings."
MHOC,3a74yl,bleepbloop12345,3,Wed Jun 17 23:17:05 2015 UTC,"I agree, I'll amend it to that to make it less confusing for the next reading."
MHOC,3a74yl,SPQR1776,3,Thu Jun 18 01:45:43 2015 UTC,"OK, so similarly to what /u/InfernoPlato said, surely this bill is just useless, because the people who wanted spikes on the property will just chase the homeless people away, whereas the people who didn't want spikes won't, so it will literally be the same as before?"
MHOC,3a74yl,willo77,2,Thu Jun 18 15:11:44 2015 UTC,"If you look at the spikes in the picture I linked you can see that it's just outside a large block of flats. I would imagine that the spikes had been installed by the owners, perhaps because they thought the property fetch a higher price without homeless people sleeping outside it, and that the actual residents are fairly ambivalent as to whether people sleep there. I doubt that they'd want to chase them away.  Even if people are desperate to keep the homeless away from their doorways then I'd be amazed if they kept a constant guard, permanently waiting to run out and scare them off. Sure, this won't mean that the homeless are always able to sleep in doorways but it's certainly a step in the right direction."
MHOC,3a74yl,bleepbloop12345,3,Thu Jun 18 17:56:19 2015 UTC,"You're still allowed to chase the homeless away   So you are saying that the homeless shouldn't be sleeping in those areas anyway, but if you aren't there to catch them then you should make it easier for them to be able to do so"
MHOC,3a74yl,tyroncs,6,Wed Jun 17 20:59:57 2015 UTC,"No, I'm saying that people should be creating permanent structures to make life miserable for the homeless. If they really don't want them outside their home then I suppose it should be legal for homeowners to ask them to leave."
MHOC,3a74yl,bleepbloop12345,5,Wed Jun 17 21:04:29 2015 UTC,"If it is legal for homeowners to tell them to leave, then it should also be legal for them to ensure that people can't be there in the first place"
MHOC,3a74yl,tyroncs,3,Wed Jun 17 23:53:48 2015 UTC,"Why? As an MP I try to base my judgement on matters such as this on utilitarianism, rather than moralistic appeals to ""rights"". Allowing homeless people the comparative safety of a doorway may well stop them from freezing to death, or save them from being attacked and robbed. Thus it will improve their quality of life greatly, while the inconvenience to the homeowner will be utterly minor.   I think it should be legal for homeowners to ask them, even demand, that they leave, but not legal for them to force them to do so."
MHOC,3a74yl,bleepbloop12345,2,Thu Jun 18 00:01:46 2015 UTC,"Well if a homeowner strongly doesn't want to have homeless people on their property, currently they can put spikes down etc to make sure of that - whereas if this bill passes the only way they can do so is to be present there all the time to tell them to go if they try and stay on the property."
MHOC,3a74yl,tyroncs,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:14:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is a correct reading of the bill.   Well done."
MHOC,3a74yl,bleepbloop12345,7,Thu Jun 18 17:51:17 2015 UTC,"An excellent bill. These features are making life difficult for the worst off in our society.  There aim is to move the homeless to another area. It is the worst sort of nimbyism. if we don't want to see homelessness we must ensure that no one is forced to sleep on the street, not drive them away to someone else's area. It should be remembered that 10% of the homeless, some 9,000 are ex-servicemen. We should ask ourselves is this the way we should treat those who have risked their lives for our freedom. I call upon both sides of the house to support this bill."
MHOC,3a74yl,AlbertDock,2,Wed Jun 17 20:52:38 2015 UTC,"Hear hear, but the finer detail the above is legislated in is wrong."
MHOC,3a74yl,GeoSmith16,11,Thu Jun 18 17:35:45 2015 UTC,"The complaints about 'property rights' in this thread are a little painful to read since they seem to come from some weird, ultra-libertarian idea that you can build whatever you want on your property. You have much less freedom over what you can build on your land than you think you do. Pretty much anything you want to build will require planning permission from the council. Compared to some of the things you are not allowed to do on your land, banning the use of spikes in areas readily accessible by the street only is a completely minor point. Maybe some of the members of this House will become actually invested in the wellbeing of their fellow man if they have to trip over them every morning, instead of demonising them in parliament."
MHOC,3a74yl,Cocktorpedo,4,Wed Jun 17 21:05:02 2015 UTC,"I think planning permission is a vital part of the system of owning property. Adaptions to nearby properties will affect both the quality and value of your own property, hence, part of the defence of private property includes maintaining a good standard of nearby property.  Deciding who comes onto your land is a totally different affair. If people wish to keep homeless people off their land, it's their prerogative. Deciding who goes on your land will have no affect on nearby properties - so we should not legislate to restrict people in doing so.   As an aside, I expect a preventative measure such as these benches is far better than say, a fight over whether to stay.  I too care about the fellow man, but equally we must care about society - a society built on the right to earn and to own."
MHOC,3a74yl,treeman1221,2,Wed Jun 17 21:34:50 2015 UTC,"Wow a Green MP who completely missed the point, who would've thought! If you actually took time to understand, it's not about planning permission or owning the right to construct what you want on your land, it's about having homeless people trespassing on your land. An individuals land or property isn't just a free haven for anyone who wishes, there are trespassing laws to prevent this."

MHOC,3a74yl,Jamie54,5,Thu Jun 18 09:56:45 2015 UTC,"I cannot stress enough just how important this bill is.

MHOC,3a74yl,thedexer102,4,Thu Jun 18 12:48:51 2015 UTC,"Mr Speaker,   I agree with this bill, but I have two observations.   Firstly, the timelines seem a little short. It seems that two months' notice is probably not enough time and would incur not insignificant expense. I would suggest a 6 month deadline.   Secondly, the bill needs to make clear what exactly is prohibited. Is it building with the intent of making something hostile to sleeping, or is it anything which is hostile to sleeping but in a other configuration would not be? From the outset the bill states intent, but the wording on that front is not consistent."
MHOC,3a74yl,bnzss,5,Thu Jun 18 06:34:51 2015 UTC,"I would suggest a 6 month deadline.   While I agree it should be longer, we probably want to get this going before winter is in full swing. I think 4 months would be better."
MHOC,3a74yl,Djenial,3,Thu Jun 18 07:04:04 2015 UTC,That's a fair point. 3 months seems a happy medium.

MHOC,3a74yl,bnzss,4,Fri Jun 19 06:58:42 2015 UTC,"Mr Speaker, I feel the name of the bill will offer some confusion as bills that purely cites ""friendly environment"" suggests that there will be a nature element.    I feel that inserting the work Urban e.g. ""Friendly Urban Environment Act"" would make it clearer to the population the exact scope of this bill."
MHOC,3a74yl,Tsoski,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:02:05 2015 UTC,"I would gladly change this, but unfortunately titles of bills cannot be changed."
MHOC,3a74yl,SPQR1776,5,Thu Jun 18 18:45:45 2015 UTC,"We need this bill to send the message that as a society we treat homeless persons as humans not as vermin.  The government has a package of further homelessness legislation being worked on, but we want this propelled through before winter. We are not simply ticking a 'we've done something relating to homelessness' box and moving on.   This is an improvement on the first bill, there are still some issues with wording etc that have been covered by others, and I encourage the author to make further amendments, and I'd add to the issues mentioned 1- it's not clear how this will be enforced 2 I'm not sure it's possible to replace benches this quickly 3 are you allowed to change the title? This isn't an environmental bill as is implied 'Homeless Persons Accommodating Spaces Act' is my suggestion. 4 generally speaking legislation like this acts less strictly on something that was in place before the act but not removed than something placed in defiance -- this act sets the same fine.   Finally section 1.3 refers to anti homelessness spikes, how is this defined? Even if we did define this, couldn't people just put 'anti homelessness spheres' or other methods of making the space uncomfortable. I dealt with this in my proposed act https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PSq1mYhPDlr6VF_I3meqUxuuI-fwAPfEtt2yse6bgFQ/edit.  I think it's better to talk about function than form."
MHOC,3a74yl,bensaysyaya,9,Thu Jun 18 16:45:38 2015 UTC,"So we are stopping people from building structures on land they own, because homeless people can't sleep on them. Great, just great.  Surely we should be encouraging the homeless to seek shelter rather than having them sleeping rough? and this bill unfortunately will only encourage the homeless to sleep on park benches and similar places.  If I was to have problems with homeless people sleeping on the benches in my garden or on structures at my house, then I would be very minded to make it harder for them to do so. I cannot imagine it is a pleasurable experience to have a look out towards your garden in the morning and see a homeless person sleeping on your benches."
MHOC,3a74yl,Duncs11,10,Wed Jun 17 19:44:46 2015 UTC,"You don't seem to have read the bill properly if you believe that it would mean that we must allow the homeless to sleep on benches that're on our private property. It very specifically only bans public benches from being designed in order that the homeless can't sleep on them. The only structure that you're prevented from building on 'land you own' is homeless spikes on a doorway that faces the street. Personally I can't say that I've ever seen spikes in the doorway of an individual's residence. Even if you do have a burning desire to force the homeless away from your doorway then you're still allowed to make them leave.  The sad fact is that we don't have enough shelter for all homeless people, and until we do we must attempt to find them the most suitable places to sleep possible in order that they're not attacked and in order that they don't freeze to death. This will hardly 'encourage' anyone to sleep rough. It'll just mean that those who must will have a comparatively safer place to do it in."
MHOC,3a74yl,bleepbloop12345,3,Wed Jun 17 20:05:04 2015 UTC,"I think instead you'll find the definitions are very poorly defined and need clearing up, so we're clear on what exactly needs to be taken down and what doesn't, because right now it's very difficult to tell"

MHOC,3a74yl,GeoSmith16,3,Wed Jun 17 19:53:09 2015 UTC,"I think when looking at this it is important to consider the long term picture. By a local area having anti-homeless benches and spikes, they are simply moving the homeless on somewhere else, without actually dealing with the problem. However, in terms of private property, I don't see why someone should be forced to remove anti-trespasser items, because this is simply infringing property rights.  So in summary, my Hon. Friend, I believe this legislation to be a sensible and practical in for public places, a good rule for future planning, and also a clear example of how we can fulfill our duties as citizens and human beings. On the other hand, this oversteps the line in the relationship between the state and the private property owner, so in that sense it is unworkable and very authoritarian."
MHOC,3a74yl,ieya404,3,Thu Jun 18 17:44:10 2015 UTC,"I actually found reading up on those 'Camden Benches' quite interesting:  http://kb.keepbritaintidy.org/litterv5/CaseStudies/camden.pdf   A wooden prototype bench and bin were tested in July 2009. People found them comfortable, easy to sit on and get up from and instinctively used the bag recess. The perch seat encourages people to sit for only a short time discouraging loitering. Interestingly, people sat on the bench in many different ways. An unexpected benefit is that the different height and width seats encouraged people to share the bench, with it being able to seat nine people at one time in several different groups. The bench provides the equivalent seating of two park type benches, saving space and money.  The primary aim of the project is to re-introduce benches into parts of Camden where they have had to be removed due to complaints about loitering and antisocial behaviour, etc. The aim is also to minimise the need for cleaning and provide more Disability Discrimination Act features.   and  http://www.inthebag.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/camden_asb_resistant_bench_apr_2011.pdf   Observational study has shown that people have taken to using the bench quickly. In fact, Camden are pleased to find people sitting on it in ways research did not predict. People seem more comfortable sharing it compared to a park bench, possibly due to the different heights and varied seating faces. A further positive accolade is that this first installation is one block from a homeless hostel, on the edge of the 24hour economy in Covent Garden, and is surrounded by high-value flats, yet no complaints have been received to date, unlike many other areas of Covent Garden, Bloomsbury, and Camden Town, which have caused the council to remove virtually all the street benches.   The design has picked up various awards:   Keep Britain Tidy ""Best practice street cleansing"" (2010) Design Council ""Best practice for reducing crime"" (2011) Centre for Accessible Environments ""Best European practice for inclusive design"" (2012)   Banning these designs may simply lead to (in the longer run) benches being removed by councils without replacement, as apparently Camden were doing before this design was created.  That doesn't feel like a positive outcome."

Banning these designs may simply lead to (in the longer run) benches being removed by councils without replacement, as apparently Camden were doing before this design was created.

We should put more effort in ensuring they don't get on the streets (the real life UKIP manifesto tried to deal with this) and taking them off it when they do, but this bill takes the attitude that we can't do anything to help the homeless apart from allowing them to sleep on benches and in doorways."
MHOC,3a74yl,alexwagbo,3,Thu Jun 18 00:09:35 2015 UTC,"No one should be sleeping in doorways, but the fact is they are.  It is a problem with many causes, which needs a multifaceted solution.  This bill would not be needed if we didn't have thousands of people in desperate situations.  The Welfare Amelioration Bill addresses some of the causes and I hope members support it. I will be bringing other measures before the house which will also help to alleviate the problem. But in the meantime we must ensure that when people are in such desperate need we do not try to hide the problem, or just move it somewhere else.  When a person is so desperate that a doorway is the best place for them to sleep, it is inhuman to deprive them of it."
MHOC,3a74yl,InfernoPlato,4,Thu Jun 18 09:04:57 2015 UTC,"I've already expressed in the first reading why this bill is ridiculous and not worth voting for. The second reading does not make it any better.   (1) “Hostile architecture” will be defined as any public bench or ledge designed with the intention of being unable to be slept on.   Benches are made for sitting on. Although I understand the desire to make life more comfortable for the homeless, I contest with such architecture being defined as hostile. Hostility brings connotations of unfriendliness and opposition. Benches such as 1, 2, and 4 are not designed with malicious intent and it is dangerous to imply they are.   (3) This definition will also extend to cover anti-homeless spikes built on both public property and in doorways facing the street on private property.   You might want to change it so it's listed as (2).  Otherwise, this section is one of the better ones.   (1) All structures determined to be hostile should be removed by 1st August 2015.   Very quick turn over isn't it? Less than two months, maybe one month by the time this bill has been voted on. I recommend changing the deadline on this to something such as 1 October or 1 September, just in time for Autumn.   (2) These should be replaced by structures to be used for the same purpose as the original structure, but non-hostile. The replacement should occur before 1st September 2015.   I would love to see somebody design and build a aesthetically pleasing replacement for 4 in that time.   (1) Structures determined to be hostile on private property should be removed by 1st October 2015.   Utterly stupid and a blatant infringement on our property rights. Homeless people will not be allowed to be on my garden or any other private property unless allowed by the owner. There is absolutely no need to include this section - unless you intend on encouraging homeless people to take resident in these areas (and if that's the case I can bring a whole host of other problems.)   (1) Structures determined to be hostile will no longer be constructed on either private or public property after the commencement of this act.   Point stands, there is no need to even apply this private property.   (1) Failure to remove the structures will result in a £5,000 fine to the owner of the structure.   Heh, that fine could be cheaper for councils to pay for instead of paying to get rid of structures and then rebuilding them.   (1) This act may be cited as the Friendly Environment Act.   A terrible name for a terrible bill overall. I would recommend that the members changes it to more accurately address what the bill does. Perhaps the Infringement of Private Property Act? Or maybe the Hostile Architecture Act?  I urge the honourable members from both sides to vote down this bill. The bill continues to force home owners to change their gardens, their homes for no reason whatsoever."
MHOC,3a74yl,SPQR1776,5,Wed Jun 17 20:36:37 2015 UTC,I hardly think that protecting the homeless is 'no reason whatsoever'.

I could see my support on the horizon if the bill was limited to public benches, but infringing upon people's private property rights is something I can not support.  Making the argument that you can get the homeless to 'move on' is a rather poor one. Why not make it so that you avoid any sort of negative encounter at all. One should not be in a situation where they have to remove peoples from their private property.   As much as I appreciate the bill's intent, I can't support what it is doing (Being section 1 (3) ). It hurts property owners and helps no one."
MHOC,3a74yl,tyroncs,2,Wed Jun 17 23:04:28 2015 UTC,"Does this bill consider and allow for councils and landowners converting hostile structures into non-hostile structures, rather than just being removed and replaced?

MHOC,3a74yl,AlbertDock,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:52:14 2015 UTC,"This is as little bit of a semantic point I feel. Amending a structure to be non-hostile IS removing the hostile structure and replacing it with a non-hostile structure. The fact they are the same structure does not concern this bill.

To me this just seems like we now have to design every public bench and ledge with the explicit intention of it allowing to be slept on.

MHOC,3a74yl,InfernoPlato,3,Wed Jun 17 21:01:21 2015 UTC,"No one would with a knowledge of design would design a bench such as that without having the intention of stopping people sleeping on it.

Without the handrails it would be more of a platform and would look odd, and even if you only put them on the edges it would still not be able to be slept on.  Also if you look at it it seems the bench is put together in different sections, which are then joined by handrails"

So, in short, we agree.

We are developing our legislation on homelessness with careful and thorough consideration, and we will present it to the house when we have completed that process. The most effective root and branch legislation inevitably takes time to develop, I'm sure you will understand. The issue the 'friendly environment act' deals with would have been in a government homelessness act (in a more polished form), but it was submitted as a PMB and it was agreed that we should support it to enable it's effects to be seen before winter. I can also confirm that the Department of Work and Pensions are considering what they can do to help, particularly young people, who have been made homeless to get back on their feet - by liberalising housing benefit rules for work and training for these cases."
MHOC,3a74yl,AlbertDock,2,Fri Jun 19 13:08:03 2015 UTC,"Yet the Government is working on a symptom, rather than a cause. This Bill does two things. One: It gives homeless people a bench/doorway/shopfront to sleep in, or kicked at in, or moved from. Two: It is dictating what people can and cannot have on their own land. This is a secondary concern of mine, but does the member not think that there are other ways of keeping the homeless from private property? Guard dogs, spotlights, burglar alarms - those will cause more harm to them than a bunch of spikes ever could. Surely this must have been considered - I even pointed that out in the last reading, the reaction being ""we'll illegalise guard dogs"".   Truly, a well thought out thing."

MHOC,3a74yl,GeoSmith16,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:38:12 2015 UTC,"As mentioned by previous posts, the language of the bill is shaky and does not seem to help keep homeless from sleeping on the benches.  Forcing the property owners to modify their existing benches to prevent homeless from sleeping on them without doing anything to assist the owners or the homeless just makes life difficult for both. The homeless have no place to sleep.   The bill also lacks any clear use for the money collected from violations.    If the intent of the bill is to clean up the streets of homelessness, it fails because it creates an illusion of streets free of homelessness without actually helping those who are afflicted.   If the government wishes to really to protect the homeless, it needs to help them off the streets first."

MHOC,3a53gp,InfernoPlato,3,Wed Jun 17 21:02:31 2015 UTC,"You should direct your questions to the SoS for International development. Whilst my uncle works for the government to deliver aid in East Africa so I have some insight.  I will credit you with assuming that you do want to help people around the world in poverty, and are willing to put tax payers money into it if it worked - but that you think international aid isn't effective. The government would welcome suggestions on how to improve international aid's effectiveness or other vehicles by which you believe we can help alleviate world poverty. Foreign aid in the past has been often implemented poorly and with the wrong intentions. I wouldn't exaggerate this to imply foreign aid is non-effective - the evidence you pick is not representative of academic or professional opinion on the topic. So it's not 'non-effective', but that said we do need to change  the way foreign aid is delivered. To deliver closer to people in need not governments, and where we do go through governments we do so on the basis of the government provably delivering on projects. We need to be delivering aid on the basis of need and effectiveness not to buy favours or win contracts. of course we need to use diplomacy to encourage governments spend less on defence ect so they can do more to help the poorest in their country and to encourage democracy. The argument that aid is just 'hand outs' is deeply flawed, it is more often projects that help grow skills, enable entrepreneurship and develop infrastructure necessary for communities and individuals to achieve and will bring long term benefits, such as improving healthcare. Irrigation projects to enable land to be more productive are common for example, or providing better farming equipment. Where there are hand outs they are not normally initiated by government aid except in crisis situations."

MHOC,3a2iyu,bobbybarf,3,Tue Jun 16 20:10:32 2015 UTC,"Mr Speaker,  I understand the idea behind this bill is a noble one, but I feel this bill is simply too easy to circumvent - and if it applies to its strictest extent, it may hinder development.  Some thoughts:   “Park” may refer to a nature park (Walkways, trees, ponds, grass, benches etc), a nature reserve (a private piece of land inhabited by natural wildlife in order to protect and preserve their species. Can also be public as well as private) or a children’s play park (slides, roundabouts, other play equipment).   This seems either too generous a description of 'park', or not specific enough. The somewhat ad hoc distinction between public and private doesn't make sense to me. And this may reasonably be taken to mean any green area anywhere.  The entirety of section 2 needs to be re-worded. It is superficially worded as if parks must be protected, but it says that it can be done if 'absolutely necessary', which basically renders the whole provision useless. Nothing is actually protected at this point, because, let's be fair, we have a huge housing shortage, and the case for absolute necessity would be easy to make.   C. Any damage done to protected parks will be classed as a criminal offence and the perpetrator will be fined accordingly   Is this not already the case?"
MHOC,3a2iyu,Djenial,2,Wed Jun 17 08:55:26 2015 UTC,I can certainly get behind this bill. It is crucial that we preserve our green spaces.

The five biggest cities in the UK, according to this source are:   London with 7,074,265 people Birmingham with 1,020,589 people Leeds with 726,939    people Glasgow   with 616,430 people  Sheffield with 530,375 people   All five of these cities are quite evenly distributed across the country and with the grants going to the five biggest cities, it is more than fair and it means poor areas such Sheffield are not being snubbed."

Not only will it stop this bill from being amended each time we want to give money to a city, it would also stop a city from receiving funds which it doesn't need - preventing wasteful spending."
MHOC,3a2iyu,thewriter1,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:59:23 2015 UTC,"As stated in the bill this is an initial grant, there is nothing to stop funding going to other cities at a later date."

These places are already wealthy, London especially. Why not let Yorkshire, Cumbria, Tyneside, and, as the right hon. member of the SNP has said, Scotland (specifically Clydeside and Glasgow) get priority? They need the money for their planning - Yorkshire's cities still look like something from the Reconstruction for Heaven's sake."
MHOC,3a2iyu,thewriter1,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:00:27 2015 UTC,The furthest north this goes is Manchester - in the Midlands.   wat  I suggest the member refresh his knowledge of geography. Manchester is by no means the Midlands.
MHOC,3a2iyu,bobbybarf,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:06:27 2015 UTC,"The point still stands - why have large swathes of the North been overlooked yet again? Why is it that Governments simply do not care about the North? No, yet again flagship grants are given to the already wealthy areas simply so that if they do not work no one really notices. One can get away with risking that money in rich areas as it can be easily hidden if mistakes are made. Consider the North, consider Scotland. Did the authors even consider Wales at all? No. It is stuck in the English south or wealthier North as per usual."
MHOC,3a2iyu,thewriter1,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:13:32 2015 UTC,"I suggest the member look at the fact that half of the cities chosen are most decidedly in the North. I further contend that as per usual that people forget the Midlands even exists. I am proud Midlander and while Manchester is dubbed a ""Northern Powerhouse"" by the RL government the Midlands is left to rot. Becoming with HS2, just an extension of London's commuter belt.   Finally, I have family from Liverpool and I can say Liverpool has areas that are not at all wealthy and I find it offensive that the member asserts that there are no issues there. I suggest the member get it through his skull that this is merely a initial grant and if the scheme is successful it will be rolled out across the rest of the nation."
MHOC,3a2iyu,bobbybarf,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:20:27 2015 UTC,"I am aware that some areas of Liverpool are not wealthy. Neither is Wales, Barnsley, Wakefield, parts of Tyneside. Liverpool, however, would have gotten more money through being named ""City of Culture"", would it not? It also has a tourist industry due, largely, because of The Beatles. Manchester, however, is wealthy. London certainly is. Perhaps the member should get it through his head that the authors should have distributed the grants better. Heck, they could have even given some to the 'left to rot' Midlands instead of London."
MHOC,3a2iyu,InfernoPlato,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:27:21 2015 UTC,"It is a falsity that London as a whole is wealthy, the wealth is concentrated in a few small areas, many other areas like Newham are in dire need of investment. Once again the member needs to get it through his skull that this is an INTIAL GRANT And Funding is available for other cities should this scheme prove successful. My own city Leicester for example could apply for some grants. Lastly the assertion that Manchester is wealthy is incorrect, has the member ever been to Salford? (Admittedly a separate area to Manchester proper but part of Greater Manchester and considered part of it with regards to the grant)"
MHOC,3a2iyu,bobbybarf,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:42:34 2015 UTC,What I am asking is why the initial grant does not touch Yorkshire or Tyneside. Why not use a list like the one which the right hon. /u/InfernoPlato has presented?

MHOC,3a2iyu,SPQR1776,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:51:03 2015 UTC,"I assure you that the areas chosen were not arbitrary, they were chosen because of the political structure of the local areas. The areas of Greater London, Manchester and Liverpool are independent metropolitan authorities. Therefore the policy will be easier to implement. The reason Sheffield was excluded from the first round of funding is due to the fact it is within the South Yorkshire metropolitan authority, and indeed many areas traditional considered on the outskirts of Sheffield are within Derbyshire. While I also concede that Birmingham is in the same position, (Being within the West Midlands metropolitan authority) it was felt that the second city of the United Kingdom deserved a place. So a number of factors were taken into consideration when choosing the cities where funding would go."

MHOC,3a2iyu,GeoSmith16,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:51:57 2015 UTC,"I applaud the general thrust of the bill, though am concerned that some of the wording may be rather more loosely worded than intended.   Already existing countryside outside of the city centre is to also be protected so that it can not be developed upon in the future.   By definition, all countryside is outside of city centres; this would appear to enact a permanent green belt on everything that isn't already (sub)urban.  I'm not sure that making it impossible to ever develop on a particular piece of land is necessarily wise; Edinburgh for example has recently begun rebuilding Portobello High School (whose existing campus is too small) on a section of Portobello Park - no other land was available in the area to house a school of that size, and so ultimately it was agreed that the common good was served best by allowing development on part of the park.  I would suggest that a reasonable compromise might be to allow councils to develop on existing parks, if they provide at least a comparable amount and quality of land elsewhere within their boundaries to be changed over to park (and probably demonstrate community support for this)?"
MHOC,3a2iyu,klanny,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:46:07 2015 UTC,"As the bill states   ""D. If it’s absolutely necessary for progress, certain parks may be permitted to be removed but they MUST be replaced somewhere under a 1 mile radius within a year of its demolition"""

MHOC,3a2i29,Timanfya,21,Tue Jun 16 18:42:17 2015 UTC,"The first issue with this is that the L30 is a far superior gun to the Rheinmetall 120mm L/55. The L30 is rifled, giving its rounds superior stability at long range. In fact the precedessor to the L30, the L11(Used on the Chieftain since the 1960s), has the record of the longest tank vs tank kill in all of history at over 5000metres range. Being rifled also gives massive versatility in which types of ammunition we can use, primarily giving us the ability to use HESH rounds. HESH is the ultimate in multi-purpose ammunition, it can destroy anything. Tanks, Bunkers, Pillboxes, Houses, Soft Vehicles, ANYTHING. However smoothbore cannons, such as the Rheinmetall, cannot effectively use HESH because it requires the centrifugal force of the spin from the rifling to correctly spread the plastic explosive on whatever surface it is impacting. To lose this capability would be devastating to our Armoured Corp, they rely on HESH massively.  Aside from this the associated issues of fitting the gun to our tanks are ridiculous. The gun 'fits' easily enough, the mounting is fine. However our current gun fires three-part ammunition. This gun fires single-part ammunition. Our turret is designed to accommodate the current type of ammunition with separate charge bags etc. The MoD actually retrofitted one of these guns to a Challenger2 in an investigation to see how realistic the idea of swapping guns really was. They discovered that due to the way our turret is designed they could only fit less than a dozen rounds, as opposed to the 50+ that currently fit. A minor redesign would do nothing to solve this, as such it required essentially an entirely new turret. This is obviously a very large undertaking.  Also doing this for the sake of fitting in with NATO and being able to use their ammunition is ridiculous. Our logistics are fine, we never encountered serious issues regarding ammunition during the wars we have fought recently. We should give our armed forces the best, not what everyone else uses. The only reason the MoD considered this back in 2006 was because the factory which produced the ammunition we were using had closed and it would have been expensive to start a new one. They decided that economically it might be best to purchase ammunition off of other countries instead and because the NATO ammunition is cheap due to being produced in bulk we could do that. Thus the entire project was started, and concluded that it'd be cheaper to just open a new factory due to the aforementioned issue with designing an entirely new turret. Opening a new factory is exactly what we did in the end.  So, this idea was only floated in 2006 due to a logistical issue regarding a factory closure. This is an issue that no longer exists, we opened a new factory. It is going to be forever debated whether rifled or smoothbore is superior, it may be that ke penetrators will be more effective with smoothbore due to a higher muzzle velocity and no need for a slipping drive band reducing complexity however we do not know this for a fact as the MoD obviously do not release performance figures for the latest fin rounds. It could be that, due to greater accuracy, our current fin rounds are actually superior to DM53 or DM63 rounds which we'd be using if we went smoothbore. By going smoothbore it is also a simple fact that we lose versatility.  This entire motion arises due to an issue which no longer exists, it will give us less versatile ammunition choices, and may actually make the types of ammunition we already have less accurate and less effective.  A vote for this motion is a vote to downgrade our armoured fleet at an extremely considerable cost to the taxpayer. To do that is simply madness."

MHOC,3a2i29,willo77,3,Tue Jun 16 19:17:49 2015 UTC,"Look at it this way, we buy a whole new fleet of tanks because we need replacements for the last ones which are no longer functional enough for us, or we upgrade them now, get 10 more years out of the Challenger II MBTs, and then we can buy a new fleet of tanks when we are more economically stable.  You tell me which option you think is preferable, and which one is more expensive."
MHOC,3a2i29,DevonianAD,5,Tue Jun 16 19:27:59 2015 UTC,"In what way is Challenger 2 no longer functional? As my other post makes clear the current gun is superior and more functional/versatile than any smoothbore gun we may use. We also have NO issues regarding the procurement of ammunition, that was solved in 2006 because fitting the smoothbore gun was more expensive than just opening a new factory to produce more ammunition for the gun we already use.  The more expensive option, by hundreds upon hundreds of millions, is to replace the gun with a smoothbore one because it'd require draftsmen to design an entirely new turret which then has to be produced and fitted to every tank in the fleet. The cheaper option is to continue using the gun and turret we do, and just keep the factory going producing more ammunition.  The MoD concluded this in 2006, and this is why the plan never went further than a test vehicle. Did nobody consider asking themselves why it never went forward in 2006, the motion even says it was considered and scrapped!"

But in some cases, such as a country invading another, annexing it for itself, and continuing an unjust war in which hundreds of civilians are killed and then continuing its expansion as /u/Crazyoc says...   but should Russia continue it's expansion   ... War is necessary.  It is in everybody's priority not to start WW3, but that is not what the Oppositon strives to do.  It is in everybody's priority not to start nuclear armageddon, but that is not what the Opposition strives to do. Not only this, but also talking about 'nuclear armageddon' is nothing but fearmongering and it is disgraceful.  What the Opposition strives to do is protect our nation and its people from the real threat that is Russia.   Russia who invades another sovereign state and annexes their land.   Russia who shoots down with a missile a passenger plane, killing all those on board.   Russia who continues a gruelling, bloody war in the East of Ukraine that is unjust.   And it is this Russia that people are afraid of, this Russia that we must prevent from any more attempted expansionism. Upgrading our tanks to the required standard is precaution for if any of this should happen, and is the right thing to do."

The EU taunted Ukraine, offered it terrible entry conditions, and then when it declined the offer to join (which, by the way, was an astute move on Ukraine's part) the EU backed a coup against a democratically elected government. Now if that isn't aggressive expansionism I don't know what is! The ongoing war is partly Russia's fault, sure, but it's far more the fault of the West. Besides, historically Crimea was always a part of Russia proper, and only joined Ukraine as part of a bureaucratic rejigging of territories within the USSR.   Sure, it's probably fear-mongering to say that nuclear Armageddon is a realistic possibility, but equally it's fear-mongering to say imply that Russia's just waiting to expand into Eastern Europe and reestablish some sort of neo-Soviet Bloc. The opposition will save absolutely nobody by playing up the likelihood of war and by maintaining the falsehood that Russia is the aggressor in this instance."

MHOC,3a2i29,SPQR1776,2,Tue Jun 16 20:09:34 2015 UTC,"A conventional war between NATO and Russia would still be a war of such unimaginable casualties and devastation that it is still an unacceptable option. During the last world war over 60 million people were killed, more than 3% of the total population in 1939. That same statistic translated with today's population would mean 210 million deaths world wide.  I will not dispute the importance of World War II, but painting the current situation with Russia in the same light as the world right before the Second World War is absurd. We do not have a fascist dictatorship sending people to death camps. I do not like Putin, but he is no Hitler. It is far more like pre-World War I, two imperialist blocs trying to maintain as much power as possible. We have that same sense of chauvinism, and the presence of that fateful error of forgetting what the true cost of a conventional war is. Yes it will not be as bad as a nuclear war, but it such a war between NATO and Russia would be without a doubt a horrendous affair in which we would lose millions of lives and our world would be devastated in a way it hasn't been for over sixty years.   So I ask if you're willing to send 210 million men, women and children to their deaths, because I certainly am not."

Whatever this house decides, we are still subject to the laws of physics. The advantage of hidden tanks is destroyed if when they fire they are unable to hit their targets. If there is an invasion from Russia the battle will be decided, not by the supply of ammunition, but by the effectiveness of the rounds we deploy.  To this end I believe that we are safer relying  on a accurate weapon rather than one with lots of ammunition."

Progressive, eurgh.  Anyway, the real point of this message is to point out this member was in the Conservative Party previously, and is now part of the ""Progressive Democrats."" Is Conservative not the opposite of ""Progressive?"" This really, to me, sums up how far the Conservative party has strayed from its values. To the extent that members who are ready to form ""Progressive"", anti-conservative parties can find their homes in it and not look out of place.  In conclusion, /u/Pallas_ for Tory leader!"

In real life  and in mhoc, though to different degrees, the 'conservatives' are no longer tories but economically liberal in the classical sense, socially progressive or at best socially agnostic.

Originally an Irish republican party, it was founded on 23 March 1926 after a split in Sinn Féin on the issue of abstentionism.  Fianna Fáil's name is traditionally translated into English as Soldiers of Destiny, although a more accurate rendition would be Warriors of Fál (""Fál"" being a legendary name for Ireland).  Historically, Fianna Fáil has been seen as to the left of Fine Gael and to the right of Sinn Féin and the Labour Party and is generally seen as a classic ""catch all"" populist party - representing a broad range of people from all social classes.   Fianna Fáil has led governments including parties of the centre-left (Labour and the Green Party) and of the centre-right (the now-defunct Progressive Democrats). It has been led by Micheál Martin since January 2011.

MHOC,39x9yg,UnderwoodF,4,Mon Jun 15 23:39:28 2015 UTC,"I think it should be the Smith Commission just now.  But there's a part of the argument that I believe is being ignored.  I don't think it's right that extra powers should be held up as a campaign pledge or as a bribe whenever Westminster feels it is needed.  It's my strong belief that there is something wrong that, so long after the forming of the Scottish Parliament, it is only now that it's getting extra powers and responsibility.  What is needed, in addition to the Smith Commission Report being implemented is an actual, proper timetable for increasing the powers that are devolved at a gradual rate."

I'm not sure why you would then go to asking me about FFA for Yorkshire.  That's a bizarre leap of logic"

I believe that we are living in a different world and under different threats from the one where it was necessary and I think it is a waste of money to renew it.

I'm not sure about Police Scotland, I'm still dubious about how having one police force for somewhere the size of Scotland can be a good idea.  Each area has unique problems, given the different nature of, for example, a rural area like the Highland and Islands and a large city such as Edinburgh."
MHOC,39x9yg,williamthebloody1880,2,Tue Jun 16 23:54:45 2015 UTC,"What does the minister have to say about the Prime Minister's remarks about giving Scotland  a ""greater say"" in the running of British military bases and the use of British military personnel?   Does he not believe that encouraging Scotland to have it's own national interests separate from the UK - and effectively it's own defence policy - could create a conflict of interest between the UK and Scotland at some point in the future, and could result in Scotland not contributing it's fair share to the country's armed forces?"
MHOC,39x9yg,SeyStone,5,Mon Jun 15 23:16:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think that /u/whigwham was hinting at the last bit at all and that is nothing but fearmongering from the member.  I disagree with my colleague about the personnel, with the caveat that they already do through Westminster.  Bases are a different matter.  They often form a large part of the local economy and I believe that Scotland should have a significant say in what happens to them, considering the damage that would be caused if they were to be scaled down/closed."

The Prime Minister literally talked about Scotland having it's own interests. You don't think this could result in a clash between the UK in Scotland over what is British and what is Scottish overseas interests?   Scotland should have a significant say in what happens to them, considering the damage that would be caused if they were to be scaled down/closed.   Can this not be said about bases in any part of the country?"
MHOC,39x9yg,SeyStone,2,Mon Jun 15 15:35:40 2015 UTC,"overseas interests of Scotland as a part of the UK.   (Emphasis mine.)  In the PM's own words.  As part of the UK, not on it's own.  The member is trying to twist the PM's words to scare people and raise fear, which is a game I have no interest in playing.   Can this not be said about bases in any part of the country?

A useless ""parliament"" that was only created as a short-term political gimmick, which is a pointless layer of unnecessary government, will get in the way of the British war effort and our ability to manage and allocate the resources of the country.  I'm in favour of abolishing it now, but this is an example of a case where its abolition (or perhaps temporary suspension) is a necessity."
MHOC,39x9yg,trident46,6,Mon Jun 15 23:05:54 2015 UTC,"For a short term political gimmick, the Scottish Parliament has lasted an awful long time...  While there would be an argument for temporarily handing back some powers to Westminster, the fact is that there are things that were different between Scotland and the rest of the UK (education, justice are just two examples) before devolution and I can't see how we would be best served removing them from Hollyrood and handing them back to Westminster."
MHOC,39x9yg,williamthebloody1880,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:08:55 2015 UTC,Can the Secretary of State draw the line: how much power should Holyrood have in Scotland and how much power should Westminster have in Scotland?
MHOC,39x9yg,Tsoski,3,Mon Jun 15 23:14:21 2015 UTC,"While I draw the line for the moment on FFA, I do think that Hollyrood should have more power in Scotland.  Certainly, things that are in the interests of the UK as a whole should be run from Westminster."
MHOC,39x9yg,williamthebloody1880,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:36:57 2015 UTC,"Mr Speaker, does my honorable friend the Secretary of State believe that Air passenger duty should be devolved to Scotland?   I would also like to ask him on how he feels the government can do more to encourage the uptake of youth sport in Scotland to combat Scotland's growing youth obesity problem?"
MHOC,39x9yg,ieya404,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:48:41 2015 UTC,"As I've said before, I believe what we need a proper, structured timetabled approach to Scotland getting FFA.  This would certainly include devolving air passenger duty.  I think that youth obesity is a problem everywhere in the country and would love Scotland to be at the front of changing things.  I think the government should consider passing laws to increase the amount of PE at schools.  We should also be encouraging local councils to not sell of sports grounds and areas and make it easier and cheaper for young people to attend sports centres.  And I would be willing to work with the relevant colleagues and any other members of the house who feel the same on this issue.  I also think we should be talking with football teams, the Murray siblings (and their mother, who already does a lot in this regard) about getting them involved more as well.  Sometimes, unfortunately, it does take the possibility of meeting a famous sports star to get young people going.  If that's what it takes, and we can sneak some sports in there while they're not looking, so be it."
MHOC,39x9yg,williamthebloody1880,3,Mon Jun 15 23:20:30 2015 UTC,"As I've said before, I believe what we need a proper, structured timetabled approach to Scotland getting FFA.   May I ask, do you genuinely believe that FFA is in Scotland's interests?  Over the last fifteen years, Scotland's public spending has been around £1450 higher, per capita, relative to the rest of the UK.  It should be noted this is not through any particular wastefulness or profligacy, but reflects the fact that with a population which is very thinly spread over huge amounts of land once you get beyond the central belt, public services become expensive to provide - especially to our island communities.  Onshore tax revenues per capita are around £250 less per head than the rest of the UK.  This adds up to a gap of around £7-8bn a year, over and above the deficit we're already running, which would give a fiscally independent Scotland a deficit of around 8.5% - for context the EC's growth and stability pact considers anything over 3% to be excessive, and the highest in Europe at present is Croatia at around 5.5%.  By raising taxes, or slashing spending, by around 16% Scotland could come back into line with the rest of the UK - neither choice exactly being palatable!  Offshore revenues from North Sea oil and gas have made up that gap three times in the last fifteen years - a wonderful bonus when it happens, but nothing that could be relied upon.  Is this not an example of where, as with the UK as a whole, we really are better together, where revenues are taken across the entire UK and spent across the UK where they're needed?"
MHOC,39x9yg,ieya404,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:29:05 2015 UTC,"This is why I'm in favour of a gradual move to FFA.  If we just say to Scotland, here you go you're in charge, it would be a disaster for Scotland and for the UK as a whole, for the reasons you mention.  (Growing up in Aberdeen, I know how volatile the oil revenue is which is why I automatically distrust any predictions for Scotland's financial future that relies on it.)  But if you increase things gradually, they have time to adapt and adjust.  The changes to tax and spending would also be introduced gradually, making things a lot less painful for the people of Scotland"
MHOC,39x9yg,williamthebloody1880,2,Mon Jun 15 19:09:40 2015 UTC,"Structurally, Scotland is always going to need higher spending to deliver the same services - how can even a gradual change-over adjust to that, without requiring higher taxes in a Scotland which had FFA?"
MHOC,39x9yg,ieya404,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:08:21 2015 UTC,"Hence why I said:   The changes to tax and spending would also be introduced gradually   Scotland would change through time, so that when FFA was finally achieved it wouldn't be as painful for either the country or the people."
MHOC,39x9yg,williamthebloody1880,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:55:05 2015 UTC,"I apologise for asking again for you to spell it out, but can you explain what sort of changes you envisage happening?  No other part of the UK has, or could have, population as thinly spread as in the Highlands, or as geographically awkward to support as the Hebrides, Orkney, or Shetland.  Short of entirely depopulating those areas, higher costs for the same standard of public services in Scotland as in the rest of the UK are unavoidable."
MHOC,39x9yg,ieya404,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:17:55 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with the second part of your comment (it's also why I think a centralised police force is a bad idea, as mentioned before).  I see it going a bit like this:  Let's say June 2016, the powers outlined in the Smith Report are devolved to the Scottish Parliament.  As a condition for agreeing to this, Westminster and Holyrood sit down and work out a timetable to further devolve powers on a yearly basis so that, by 2026, Scotland has FFA (this would also be met with a proportional decrease of the Barnett Formula money).  As part of that, Holyrood would have to agree that they have to run their fiscal affairs like any other country, including dealing with any deficit.  There would be tax increases (which Holyrood can actually do at the moment, I know I voted for them to do so) and spending cuts (free university tuition and free prescriptions would almost certainly change).  However, this would be better in the long run than just handing the powers to Scotland and either needing to bail them out or the tax increases/spending cuts/both happening all at once"
MHOC,39x9yg,williamthebloody1880,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:42:35 2015 UTC,"There would be tax increases (which Holyrood can actually do at the moment, I know I voted for them to do so)   Curiously enough, Holyrood actually can't do so at present, which was something of a surprise to the various opposition parties when they found out the SNP had let the power lapse...   In what way do you feel that it would be an improvement for Scotland to have tax raises and spending cuts, over the current arrangement where as part of the UK that has higher needs, it receives higher internal transfers?"
MHOC,39x9yg,Jas1066,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:58:27 2015 UTC,"I was unaware that it had lapsed, mostly because I had no idea that it was time locked at all.  (If I knew that, I likely wouldn't have voted for it in 97.)  I think that if Scotland gets FFA (whether through gradually increasing it as I want or all at once) then there is a chance that Scotland might vote for independence in the future.  If we continue giving it money like a child getting pocket money and telling it not to spend it all on sweets (not my feelings, but there are those out there that think this) they almost certainly will.  In the beginning it will be hard for Scotland and it does seem like a bad deal, but in the long term it could (and likely will) work out for the best.  It also has the pleasant side effect of shutting up all the moaners who complain about their taxes funding Scotland while it spends like a drunken sailor."

MHOC,39tp94,Timanfya,3,Sun Jun 14 17:59:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you Mr Speaker,  I would just like to notify the House that due to this bill mostly absorbing my Local Councils (Single Transferable Vote) Bill, I will be withdrawing that bill. I will, however, be looking into securing the Single Transferable Vote system for Welsh local councils, as it will be the last country to have to endure FPTP locally.  Mr Speaker, I am very happy that the local councils of England will be receiving the necessary reforms they so desperately need. Local councils in this country have been formed through an onslaught of botched reforms, and it has created a decades-long feeling of confusion and an inequality of local powers nationwide.  I am also happy that the failed voting system that is First Past The Post has been eradicated from England locally, it is a disgrace and an affront to democracy that parties can dominate or even function without opposition in councils when many in the area did not vote for them.  I am also quite relieved the England Regional Assemblies Act 2015 has been put out of its misery, even though it was hailed as the solution to devolution's issues, the bill had its flaws. I defended it because it was the best of a bad choice of solutions, and I am glad my Honourable Friend has a better solution to devolution in this country."
MHOC,39tp94,JackWilfred,3,Sun Jun 14 18:36:11 2015 UTC,"This bill aims to streamline and reform local government in England, to simplify it and remove unnecessary layers of government and complexity, while devolving more powers down from Westminster closer to the people.   This bill abolishes the Regional Assemblies introduced in the last parliament, while previously they were a great step in devolving powers down from westminster closer to the voters, with the introduction of this bill, they will be unnecessary, as the decisions will be taken even closer than the regions. This move also removes a whole previous layer of government, reducing the overall bureaucracy that exists.   The Main Premise of this bill, is streamlining previous Local Government Structures into two clear layers, ‘Authorities’ and ‘Councils’. The former will fundamentally be based on the existing Greater London Authority, and will have elected mayors who will make decisions on areas such as Police, Fire and Emergency Services and Healthcare, and will give communities more control over the services and decisions that have most effect over their lives. Councils will be similar to existing Borough Councils or District Councils, and will run a number of local services, mostly based of the existing jobs of councils.  The new boundaries for authorities are in part based on historical counties and unitary authorities, with some exceptions and changes, and councils are either based on existing councils, or old council boundaries in the cases of some Unitary Authorties.   This bill will also improve democracy and accountability in Local Government, introducing Single Transferable Vote for the election of councilors, as well as continuing the GLA model, and having Additional Member System for the Assembly and Supplementary Vote Method for the Mayor. These methods will mean that more people are represented in their local communities, and the local government politicians will be held to accountable much better.   /u/demon4372"

Or imagine if New Labour introduced the Scottish Parliament one year and got rid of it the next year. (I wish they had.)"
MHOC,39tp94,demon4372,2,Sun Jun 14 18:51:51 2015 UTC,"controversial regional devolution bill   ""controversial"", it passed comfortably    did absolutely nothing with it, and discarded it and replaced it with something else on a whim.   We are replacing it with a system we believe it better, this bill fixes a greater problem than the regional assemblies bill, but with the introduction of this bill the regional assemblies are made redundant. This is a different solution to the devolution problem, but this bill also fixes a number of other problems.  I would again note, the Regional Assemblies Bill was only ""enacted"" 2 weeks ago, and the first planned election isn't until 2016, so the supposed ""great cost"" would never happen, since we are removing them before they came into affect, and replacing them with something even better."
MHOC,39tp94,Spudgunn,2,Sun Jun 14 18:58:36 2015 UTC,"None of that deals with what I've said. Your party has made a massive policy U-turn.  I suggest we as MPs tell you what we think of this in the voting lobbies, and I suggest the voters tell you what they think of this in the ballot box."

Although it is unfortunate that the Liberal Democrats as a party have created and ended the same bill after it has been law for less than two weeks, I think the British public would be pleased to see a better system being introduced by the Liberal Democrats, and that even though we have made mistakes on this, that we have come forward and are forging a new path towards better local government before work on building regional assemblies have started.  I am fairly confident that even though some money will have been spent on planning the building of these assemblies, we made steps to end regional assemblies before the vast amount of funding required has been spent, and this money can instead be spent on reforming local councils."

Whats the difference between that and this? Except that rather than having big Regions, you have smaller authorities, giving local people more control over the local decisions.   The problem with giving too much to the councils, is if it is a council running too small a area, it can become uneconomical for them to run them.   Elected mayors make sense for cities, which have a common identity, common interests; however, I can't say that people from Swindon feel too great an affinity for people from Salisbury, and the interests of cities within a ceremonial county are not always as aligned.   The cities themselves can still have city mayors, as with the existing model. But these new authority mayors will allow for better running of areas, and better accountability for these areas.   Devolving more powers to unitary authorities, and abolishing existing two-tier district and county councils - which bear an eerie resemblance to these assemblies - would be more appropriate if the aim is to deliver power to the hands of local people.   Your plan from your answer seems to be having Regions and Councils, while mine is to have Authorities and Councils.

MHOC,39tp94,demon4372,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:26:49 2015 UTC,"Because at the moment, the council system is extremely complicated, because it has been slowly reformed 3 or 4 councils at a time.  This reforms the entire system, while also increasing their power."

MHOC,39tp94,peter199,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:01:34 2015 UTC,"The Transport powers you outline for authorities are slightly floored as the Local Transport Act I wrote has already created Transport Boards and the Government has no plans to change or provision and regulation of transport services from that set out in the Local Transport Act. In order to change this you will need to amend the Local Transport Act - or alter the devolution settlement in relation to transport. I therefore commend to the right honourable gentlemen the following alteration to the Transport section:    Regional Transport Boards will become the responsibility of authorities who will fund and oversee their operation.    a. The SoS and DfT will retain full discretion over the RTBs in the areas set out in the Local Transport Act (2014).   Passenger Transport Boards will become the responsibility of the Mayor's Office.   a. The SoS and DfT will retain full discretion over the PTBs in the areas set out in the Local Transport Act (2014).   I hope you take my suggestion on board otherwise your bill will have succeeded in doing only one thing, creating a surplus in the DfT while leaving local transport unfunded."
MHOC,39tp94,AlbertDock,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:55:43 2015 UTC,What is the projected cost of this reorganisation?         Also I have serious concerns over the potential to give these authorities control over flood defences. These are best covered by considering the catchment area of a river as a whole. There are numerous cases where rivers are covered by many different authorities.
MHOC,39tp94,Jonster123,2,Sun Jun 14 21:42:05 2015 UTC,though it would have to be in collaboration with one and another to know who is doing what and how to adjust to any potential actions
MHOC,39tp94,demon4372,2,Sun Jun 14 23:34:59 2015 UTC,"Giving them flood defences is totally at he discretion of the SoS, and regardless is actually inline with that other both given and proposed devolution packages for other areas."

MHOC,39tp94,demon4372,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:40:37 2015 UTC,"What is the projected cost of this reorganisation?   On the point of cost, firstly you have to take into account the fact that we are removing a entire layer of government, and in many cases removing complex 2-tier councils.  Ontop of that, with the greatest respect, i would rather this cost slightly more, and be done right, rather than not spending as much, and having to do it piecemeal and disorganised, as has been done so much in the past.  One of the reasons why our system is so complex is because of the way it has been reformed in the past, since people have always done it in small pieces at a time. This aims to fully reform the entire system in one go."

From my conversations with Communist Party members, there didn't seem to be any clear consensus on whether they were illegal or not - they seemed to exist in this grey area, which was, of course, incompatible with the rest of the modern world, and would have gone on to be a constant source of drama, especially considering that we have no model judiciary.

There is very little importance attached to actually learning any language, the software is of poor quality (and is often not open source or even free, meaning the students cannot learn at home), and ultimately there is not a huge amount of standardisation. I know my own secondary school did not even offer an ICT GCSE, let alone an A-level.  Having said that, I must echo /u/djenial's comment. Instead of putting something like this to a motion (which I understand the Conservative party has some sort of strange sexual craving for), a comment to the EAC would have been completely satisfactory, and we wouldn't have to waste so much time over a completely uncontroversial issue."

Lastly, sanctions do not encourage individuals to look for work and often push people further away from work as they are lost to the system.  I urge Labour to bring this bill back to the Government and in a third reading allow us to alter it so that we wash our hands of sanctions instead of the unemployed.

MHOC,39qbay,AlbertDock,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:59:33 2015 UTC,"It's not pointless it would reduce their income after paying rent and council tax by 10%. It is hard enough to be felt, but not enough to cause starvation. The hardest sanctions in percent would be for single people living at home, where potentially it could be 100%. In terms of cash it would be those getting the maximum income for job seekers of £500 p/w. They could potentially lose £300 p/w. However to be in that position they would have to own their own home outright and have a very large family.  They are not in a position where they would starve.

Lastly, sanctions do not encourage individuals to look for work and often push people further away from work as they are lost to the system.   As I pointed out in the Gov sub. This is false.

The idea that society should allow people to flounder due to external forces beyond their control is wrong. The unemployed should be helped back into work. However, the current benefits system is a trap. One cannot get help from the job centre unless one is signed on. If one has a degree one is told to leave it off the CV. It is a honeytrap, just as much as paypday lenders.   Things have to change in the system. The incentive to get back to work has to be there. Of course, I do not mean that people choose to be poor - that is an antiquated, nasty, and downright inaccurate view. Rather, the confidence has to be rebuilt. Work has to look, well, worth it.   There is also the question of those who misuse the system. There has to be a slight punitive measure in place to ward these people away - they are the apples which spoil the bushel. They have to be kept at bay.   As it stands, I agree with the Bill and it has my full support."

If you take JSA (18 to 24)of £57.90 plus rent of £70 and council tax of £10. They would have there total income increased from £137.90 to £150. An increase of £12.10.  The others who would benefit are those who have paid off their mortgage and with a few years before retirement find themselves out of work without the skills to find a job in the modern world. These tend to those who have worked in manual jobs, many of whom have never used a computer.  That is why I estimate it would only go to 10,000 people.  It is a top up to a minimum level for the poorest households, not a handout for everyone.  In this way it targets help to those most in need."

If we get rid of the rank system, who performs what roles? Who provides the leadership that is so needed in the Armed Forces? Who commands who? Or does everyone just sort of go and do their own thing without any sort of structure or coordination? How do you think logistic services will be provided properly, how do you think strategy will be decided upon?  I'm sorry but this policy of yours just demonstrates a total lack of understanding regarding how the Armed Forces function and it unnerves me that someone who would advocate should a policy is in charge of Defence.

Napoleons army's had their greatest success under, guess who, napoleon, who was a dictator who gained fame with the use of cannons on the streets of paris against protestors. Before that soldiers, from what I've read, cast ballots when given orders on the battlefield.  Armies thrive on discipline and order.

MHOC,39fzud,Spudgunn,6,Fri Jun 12 00:53:47 2015 UTC,"Opening Speech  Mr. Speaker, I have brought this bill to the House to begin to tackle a problem that was first recognised in the 1909 People's Budget of Chancellor David Lloyd George - in the United Kingdom, too few people, make too much profit, from too much of the land.  Just 0.36% (that is, two-thirds of the farming population) own 70% of the land.  To make matters worse, agricultural subsidies for the owners of this land amounts to over £4.5 billion.  This means that owning rural land pays out a net £83 per acre, on average, while one would expect to pay around £18000 in council tax - a system with which we are stuck until the introduction of the Land Value Tax - for an acre of urban land, a form of land that 70% of us have a stake in.  This brings us to our first problem: the UK has no comphrensive land registry.  We simply do not know who owns up to half of all British land.  Despite the creation of HM Land Registry, land owners have been somewhat slothful and loath to register.  Thus, this bill will, firstly, ensure that any land sold under the scheme contained within shall be added to the Registry.  However, creating a proper land register will not fix the problems with having such a large portion of land invested in the hands of so few people.  This leads to artificially inflated land costs, as we have seen, where the cost of land can amount to up to 80% of the cost of a new build.  There are 64 million people in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, with about 60 acres of land - in other words, we live in a country where, on average, each individual could own an area just smaller than a football field.  Instead, 90% of the population lives on one tenth of that, in no small part due to ths borderline monopolistic ownership of land.  Firstly, we need to start distributing the land among the population, with first priority granted to those who currently rent from rural landowners - including one-third of all farmers.  This bill allows for the formation of Community Bodies in the sale of land, which shall be given first priority in the sale of land.  However, this bill is just the first in what should become a radical change in land ownership practices in the UK.  So, in summary, this bill:   starts to create a more comprehensive land registry. Allows for the creation of Community Bodies (a company limited by guarantee of community members, defined through those who are ordinarily resident at postcode units), and gives them first priority in the sale of the land on which they live.   Thank you."
MHOC,39fzud,MorganC1,9,Thu Jun 11 13:49:45 2015 UTC,"However, this bill is just the first in what should become a radical change in land ownership practices in the UK.

If I could trust that this bill was just a policy in its own right, and wasn't part of a drive towards something else (which I certainly cannot especially since he openly admitted it in his speech) then I would have perhaps judged the bill like that. But I cannot, therefore I will not.  Also, your little statement there is somewhat misleading as this is a Private Member's Bill which means it is only associated to the Socialist Party because that private member happens to be an MP for it. Since it's a private member's bill, people will be much more inclined to look at it in the way I described in the first paragraph. I have displayed why this should not be done for the benefit of the house."
MHOC,39fzud,Spudgunn,3,Fri Jun 12 00:02:20 2015 UTC,"This bill does not give open access for Socialism to be passed through the commons. Judge this bill on its own various merits, it has no effect on the plans of the Socialist Party in the future. If it passes, we press on. If it does not, we press on. Voting against a bill on the premises that it is a show of support for the rest of our agenda is ludicrous.   This bill is a Private Member's Bill, however Zoto has the support of the Socialist Party in this submission, and he admitted that it was only submitted as a Private Member's Bill due to a lack of time to prepare it as a Socialist Bill whilst working on the budget."

This is why Zoto will regret ever having written that if he bothers to read into this chain, because it completely contradicts the notion that there is no wider agenda behind this bill. It actively states it.  Without that sentence I quoted, it would have been very easy for you to reassure the house: ""Oh, don't worry, this bill doesn't pave the way for socialism! It's clearly not a stepping stone for more radical change!"" And people may then have judged the bill on its own merits without worrying about that. I think some Conservatives would have been gullible enough."

There is a wider agenda, but that agenda is lowering house prices and the value of development land, not expropriating land from the Kulaks."

MHOC,39fzud,Zoto888,3,Thu Jun 11 18:46:43 2015 UTC,"Did the Land Value Tax not help to solve this? As from what I can tell from your bill this would allow community groups to buy areas of land, but how will that help to reduce land prices?"
MHOC,39fzud,tyroncs,5,Thu Jun 11 17:38:22 2015 UTC,"Currently, it is significantly harder to develop on this land, as this would reduce the value of the UK agricultural subsidy (which isn't dependent on the rearing of livestock or the production of crops), thus creating a form of artificial scarcity.  Community bodies would be more likely to allow development on this land - and funds dedicated to the subsidy would be saved - as the agricultural subsidy primarily benefits larger farmers, especially when you take into account the European CAP.  These farmers are also exempt from capital gains tax and inheritance tax, which reduces revenue."
MHOC,39fzud,Zoto888,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:48:35 2015 UTC,So farmers can get subsidies even if they don't farm? That is quite bad I admit. Does the bill stop this?  Also most of the land affected by this bill is protected by various means because we don't want to be developing on every bit of unbuilt land we see. Personally I think we need a top down Government run scheme for new developments across the country to ensure land isn't spoilt but there is still enough housing for all
MHOC,39fzud,ieya404,5,Thu Jun 11 17:56:55 2015 UTC,"The bill does not stop the subsidies, because that is a very complex issue.  The subsidies are sometimes needed to begin farming, for instance, so it would need a more tailored bill.  Plus, they also help to fund transport costs for those living in rural areas, unless they are renting out the land (in which case they don't have large transport costs), which is what this bill deals with indirectly.  If a community body purchased the land, then it would be expected that the funds would be distributed to the community body, albeit at a reduced rate due to the nature of the ownership.  Yes, there are still protections, which would stop unrestrained development.  However, not all rural land is protected, and it would allow development on these sites more easily."
MHOC,39fzud,Zoto888,5,Thu Jun 11 18:03:29 2015 UTC,"This means that owning rural land pays out a net £83 per acre, on average, while one would expect to pay around £18000 in council tax - a system with which we are stuck until the introduction of the Land Value Tax - for an acre of urban land, a form of land that 70% of us have a stake in.   What's the relevance of this? Why should rural land be remotely like urban land?  One will typically have housing built upon it, be served with mains electricity, gas, and water, with telephony and possibly fibre internet available, with its roads lit by streetlights and likely convenient for access to shops, workplaces, leisure activities, and transport.  The other is typically a large open field, suitable for growing crops.  So why on earth would you expect them to be remotely similar?"
MHOC,39fzud,ieya404,3,Thu Jun 11 20:48:02 2015 UTC,"What's the relevance of this? Why should rural land be remotely like urban land?   We should not be subsiding rural land that is not using for any sort of farming.  I will clarify what I said by stating that the net £83 per acre is the subsidy for someone owning rural land, while someone in an urban area will have to actually pay in tax.  The relevance is that, were a community buyout to happen, as made easier by this bill, then there would either likely be more low-cost development on it (which typically happens on former estate land, based on similar bills to this), or more actual farming taking place, which helps to justify the subsidy, although I'd still like to get rid of it."
MHOC,39fzud,Zoto888,2,Fri Jun 12 10:04:44 2015 UTC,"Of course someone in an urban area is paying in tax.  They're getting services which rural land doesn't - like streetlights, refuse collection, roads, you name it!"
MHOC,39fzud,ieya404,3,Fri Jun 12 10:38:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, they should pay more in tax, but my point is that people living on certain land qualify for a subsidy, as well as exemptions to various taxes."
MHOC,39fzud,Zoto888,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:54:01 2015 UTC,"Are these subsidies by chance part of the CAP, which we don't have much of a choice about?"

MHOC,39fzud,Zoto888,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:58:04 2015 UTC,Which subsidies in particular are these? Just looking quickly at http://www.ukagriculture.com/farming_today/bg_support_changes.cfm I'm not seeing obvious candidates.

MHOC,39fzud,Zoto888,8,Fri Jun 12 11:10:45 2015 UTC,"The claims regarding the current land registry system are ludicrous. Firstly 90% of land is registered according to the Land Registry Act 2002. Secondly, registration of land is mandatory when certain actions are taken, such as sale of the land. It's irrelevant whether the owners want to register it or not. They have to if they want to own the land. The current system performs more than well enough and there is no need to add further confusion to the issue.

There is currently nothing stopping community cooperatives buying land, other than, of course, the selling aspect of it. How dare the Chancellor (and I am anticipating some jargon laden moralistic speech in reply) steal from people? Does anyone outside of agriculture actually know how to use the land? No. As someone from a rural background I can categorically say that most do not have the slightest clue. Yes, 70% of the land might be owned by a minority - yet that land is still rented out (though with you people it is always trying to gain more power through what you see as a bunch of puppets and sheep) and worked by more.   Most farmers, the Chancellor might be surprised to know, are not the landed squires, the local lords (they fall into a an even smaller minority with smaller farms), but are mostly rather poor for their efforts. He is only attacking them due to the idiotic notion of ""they bourgeoisie - they bad"" and it is not good enough."
MHOC,39fzud,thewriter1,7,Thu Jun 11 18:10:35 2015 UTC,"There is currently nothing stopping community cooperatives buying land   No, but this bill gives them priority over other sellers at a mutually agreed price, or at a price set by a government valuation (the purpose of this valuation is to ensure that the price is not artificially inflated above the market price in order to push out potential buyers and to generally keep land prices at a market value).   steal from people   I'm sorry? The bill explicitly states that both parties must consent to the sale before it can take place.   Does anyone outside of agriculture actually know how to use the land? No   Well this is irrelevant, the land is sold to the communities already living on the land, the tenant farmers, the crofters.   yet that land is still rented out    Yes, exactly, I mentioned this in my opening speech.  One-third of all rural land ownership is owned by those renting the land - those who would form the community bodies under this bill.   but are mostly rather poor for their efforts   I'm going to dispute this on a factual basis - 30% of farmers earn between £20000 - £30000, with the median income being rather close to the median income across all sectors.  The largest group of farmers are neither poor, nor rich.  At any rate, this is irrelevant, as this bill seeks to help the farmers who live and work on the land, not the landowners themselves, as the current system of subsidies does.   He is only attacking them due to the idiotic notion of ""they bourgeoisie - they bad""    I will ask that the honourable member does not pass judgement on the character of those he does not know."

I think mandating the giving of food WHICH WOULD BE DESTROYED ANYWAY to the needy at ZERO COST to the supermarket is completely acceptable, because the alternative is, relatively, destructive. That you're saying 'this is bad but we have to allow bad things' is complete absurdism - I wasn't going to compare abstaining on this regulation to murder, but you are indirectly killing people who do not have enough food (considering that food banks run on donations from the public).

MHOC,39fgqw,Cocktorpedo,3,Thu Jun 11 19:58:31 2015 UTC,"Because what I think is right is quite often wrong.   This comes with a myriad of problems. For one, we as humans have (generally) agreed upon a moral code, as well as a body of scientific work which we accept as fact. Your approach comes from the idea that we can't possibly know anything with any significant certainty, which is... somewhat antiquated. For that matter, you're suggesting that 'we can't know anything', while simultaneously holding several viewpoints and mandating that people follow them. How do you know that being murdered isn't a great experience?  The answer to that (rhetorical) question is that the empirical evidence available to us suggests that murder probably isn't great. We can also tell that gravity pushes us down. We can even tell that supermarkets being forced to give food (at no cost to themselves) to the poor is a net overall benefit. We can say this with enough certainty as to call it a 'fact'.   The idea that none of us 'know' anything ultimately takes a black and white view of fact - that is, either something is right, or something is wrong, and this is with probability 100% or 0%. If you have reasonable empirical evidence to suggest something, then chances are that thing is right. This is generally how progress is made in the first place - when people argue against each others viewpoints, and apply open-mindedness in order to conceed whichever viewpoint is more empirically likely. And the fact is, there is no serious evidence you can give to suggest that mandating that supermarkets give their unused food away is anything but a good thing.   And what you think is quite often wrong.   At the end of the day, my views are developed from the empirical evidence available to me. I inherently think my own views are to some degree 'correct', as does everyone else on Earth. This isn't an argument for libertarianism, but an argument for reaching general consensus, which definitely exists on this topic!   Socialism is wrong, both Economically and Morally, in my opinion,but I'm not going to ban it because I may be wrong   a) i'm still not a 'socialist'  b) i don't see how socialism is 'morally wrong'.

This isn't an argument for libertarianism, but an argument for reaching general consensus, which definitely exists on this topic!

I ask because the phrase 'match days' makes me wonder.  Also, how much promotional material do you feel £5000 is going to realistically produce?"
MHOC,39fgqw,sZjLsFtA,2,Thu Jun 11 17:02:24 2015 UTC,£5000 really is tiny. That should be increased a lot. I know it says 'at least' but still.

MHOC,39br3s,MorganC1,4,Wed Jun 10 20:22:03 2015 UTC,"Opening Speech  Mr Deputy Speaker,  The beautiful game is losing its beauty. Is there a finer example of our staunchly divided economy than football, the sport where a tiny elite of billionaires reap the global markets for all their worth while at the same time insisting they can't pay their staff a living wage, where the most loyal fans are priced out of the average game and local clubs struggle week in week out just to stay alive? Football clubs are more than just an entertainment outlet for the well off. Football forms our urban identities, it makes up our culture, it has built up hundreds of years of our national heritage. In a deeply divided, workaholic world it brings thousands of us from all backgrounds together with a sense of community that exists nowhere else in modern society.  Now just a brand to be sold to the highest bidder, the working man's game has succumbed to neo-liberalism like no other. The accumulated public cultural capital of more than a century of footballing history, football clubs, their identities and their loyal fanbases are no longer anything more than the playthings of super-rich foreign oligarchs with no interest in local communities or supporters, and FIFA and the FA have dutifully disregarded any attempts to regulate this catastrophically failing industry or mitigate the exploitation of the fans in order to preserve their own self interests. It took 96 tragic, preventable deaths to get clubs to actually show any interest for the welfare of the fans, and that was only possible through years of Thatcher's government covering up their failures by demonising those fans and squeezing their wallets to pay for failed kneejerk policies under the blind guise of 'improved safety'.  Don't get me wrong, the football is better and the grounds far safer than they ever have been, but the soul has been sucked out and left to dry. Football is not a business and nor is it viable as one - some players earn more in a week than this entire house assembled today earns in a year, yet clubs are in extortionate amounts of debt and a new lower league club goes into administration on a seemingly weekly basis. Football fans are closer than ever but democracy has never been a rarer sight. It doesn't have to be this way; countries like Germany (who are no small footballing nation) have proven that a just and socially responsible model is possible, with supporter ownership, fair treatment of fans (safe standing, equitable ticket pricing) and money actually working its way to grassroots level.  /rant    Hence, I present you with this bill to take back our national game.  It firstly seeks to make ownership of football clubs more transparent, including full disclosure of any beneficial owners and shareholders. It strengthens the fit and proper persons test and makes its workings viewable to the public, to prevent more unscrupulous owners taking over football clubs, and protects key aspects of a club's identity in law so we don't see the likes of Vincent Tan throwing away a hundred years of history to boost merchandise sales in Asia. It also mandates fan representation on boards where there isn't already to ensure they have a voice.  It seeks to strongly encourage supporter ownership of clubs, as has proven successful on the continent and in the few dozen clubs that are supporter-owned here, namely Wycombe Wanderers, AFC Wimbledon and Portsmouth off the top of my head. The traditional benefactor model is flawed - clubs simply can't rely on greedy owners propping them up, only to jump ship when skies are grey and leave with supporters to pick up the debt - the time for democratic, sustainable co-operative fan ownership has come. Giving the community power over their club helps create an ownership structure that benefits the club in many ways:   Clubs develop far deeper and more long-term strategic partnerships with fans, local authorities, other clubs and local businesses, with the interests of each of these parties put at the forefront instead of way behind returning the most profit to ship offshore. They develop a greater sense of financial responsibility; an increased recognition for the necessity for clubs to live within their means and put emphasis on long term sustainability at the same time as short term success. They allow more transparency in the clubs' finances, making relevant information more available to fans and allowing a level of scrutiny and recourse not seen in privately-owned clubs.   It legalises safe standing, which has been proven to be safe, affordable and enjoyable for fans across the world, in lower leagues here and in the trials undertaken as a result of M041. It also serves to allow larger crowds and therefore a potential fall in ticket prices.  It introduces a windfall tax on broadcast deals, to redistribute money from the top flight to grassroots levels. A few months ago Sky and BT signed a £5 billion deal for TV rights to the Premier League. Five billion. At a time where people in the real world are struggling to make ends meet, where savage cuts to local authority budgets have meant the nation's footballing facilities are dire (and especially lacking for women and girls), where the number of properly trained coaches is a quarter of Germany's, and where the vast majority of clubs outside of the Football League are in substantial debt, how can pumping billions of pounds in to the hands of the Premier League be justified? How is the national game ever going to improve if the only decent football pitches our kids see are on the television? If football is going to drag its heals on redistributing money down the leagues, it's high time we stepped in.  Finally, it will cap ticket prices, and ensure a reasonable number of cheaper seats are always available. By virtue of the nature of supporting a football team, football is the biggest, most outrageous effective monopoly out there, and football fans are being consciously and shamelessly fleeced for all their worth, but people have such affection for their team that it is never questioned. Ticket prices have risen above inflation for decades, indeed since 1989 average ticket prices have risen by 716%, which at a time when the top clubs are raking in billions is not necessary, let alone fair in any sense of the word. Supporters are more than just customers, they are a part of the club; we cannot let club and community get any further apart. The title of 'the working mans' game' has been clutched from the cold, dead hands of football, let's not let it disappear forever.  Football, like the rest of the country, can be reclaimed from the grasp of corporate greed and transformed. It can be democratic, it can be diverse, it can be atmospheric. Let's do it justice.  /u/NoPyroNoParty"

I believe both the spirit and the letter of this Bill would make a difference to the fans of clubs like mine, who are outside those chosen four or five English clubs that are wealthy and successful beyond imagining.

I sympathise with the situation. The test is called the fit and proper test for the precise reason that it should filter out people that are not appropriate to run a club.

MHOC,39br3s,GeordieFaithful,2,Wed Jun 10 20:58:54 2015 UTC,Overall I think this is a decent proposal but I have a few points to make. This first relates to section 1(1) and is simply what happens if the football club does not have a beneficial owner? The second is whether section 1(1) actually intends to refer to the trustors? The final point is whether section 4(1) represents an additional tax on income from broadcasting rights or a redistribution of the original tax arrangements? Apart from that I see no harm in this bill and I think the Government should be commended for their measured response to the issue.
MHOC,39br3s,m1cha3lm,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:38:13 2015 UTC,"This first relates to section 1(1) and is simply what happens if the football club does not have a beneficial owner?   Well it's owned by someone, no? The subsections of that section give the different options for whether that owner is a supporters' trust or otherwise, so it covers all situations.   The second is whether section 1(1) actually intends to refer to the trustors?   Well yes, that's the idea isn't it? What do you mean by that?  It's worth noting that the section in question was stolen from inspired by the Football Governance Bill that was presented in real life, the language was not written by me but by actual lawyers.   The final point is whether section 4(1) represents an additional tax on income from broadcasting rights or a redistribution of the original tax arrangements?   It is an additional tax, unless there is a tax currently that I am unaware of that does the same thing and will therefore replaced by this.  Thank you for your support."
MHOC,39br3s,GeordieFaithful,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:06:06 2015 UTC,"Well it's owned by someone, no?   You don't always have a beneficial owner though. If it doesn't apply to those cases then fair enough but if I thought about it, it's unlikely football clubs wouldn't have one so I suppose that concern was unfounded.   Well yes, that's the idea isn't it? What do you mean by that?   A trustor is someone responsible for the trust. I thought you'd be interested in them not the trustees but clearly I misjudged what that bit was trying to achieve.  On the tax point, I don't know. I'd guess it would come under regular taxes so this one would be an extra earlier one? Still it sounds good and I'd vote for it if I had a vote."

MHOC,39br3s,TheQuipton,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:29:15 2015 UTC,"As a current season ticket holder (no prizes for guessing which one) and fan of a club which has all too often found itself in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons I feel this bill will go a long way to resolve some of the issues blighting the modern game.  There are a few things I would like to bring up regarding the contents of this bill for consideration.  I. I still don't agree with the idea that home fan tickets are capped £20 above the cost of an away ticket. I understand the additional costs involved with travelling to away games having done it myself on a number of occasions, but I feel that a level playing field for all fans would be more appropriate.  I don't want to put away fans off with high prices, but surely a concession can be made by the clubs to assist on the transport costs by subsiding official supporter club coaches for travelling fans which would in turn reduce policing costs.  II. I would like to see a return (albeit in a carefully controlled manner) of being allowed to consume alcohol within sight of the pitch. After all we're no longer in the 70s or 80s and the majority of trouble caused around matches is by fans who are not attending the game, they have open access to the finest local water supply in pubs and bars throughout the matches.   The majority of fans attending do not wish to lose their season ticket which is normally around the £400- £800 mark for causing trouble. Therefore I believe even relaxing the rules as a trial would benefit fans."

MHOC,39br3s,m1cha3lm,2,Wed Jun 10 23:58:56 2015 UTC,"As it happens the bill was inspired by the FSF's Twenty's Plenty campaign to reduce away ticket prices to £20, I felt this was a bit much for a sudden drop so kept it at £30. The gap between that and the £50 home price is, if anything, because the cap for home prices is actually really quite high - above nearly all of the club's average lowest ticket prices. If you would like a more level playing field I am not opposed to lowering the £50 cap, but I do not feel having a price for away tickets above £30 is justifiable for the reasons given in the link provided earlier.  Regarding the second point, it is certainly something I considered and I know there is great demand for. I feel this is something that needs to be done gradually and with due care and attention, so I propose adding a trial in the second reading, and leaving it open to future legislation beyond that."

If I could suggest some changes though:  Club Ownership: 6d) I'm not sure stadium names need the club's permission to be changed. With the exception of some clubs, the majority of clubs don't have the same emotional ties with their stadium names as they do with other things such as the name and colours.  Morecambe were also forced to change their crest a few years ago because the council stopped allowing Morecambe to use the old crest. Perhaps an exception could be made for these scenarios?   Ticket Prices: 2a) Would the price be able to be increased by 19% every season? Or just 20% upon the previously set price?  3) Surely a team could deem it worthwhile to set the price at say, £80, and then even with the 25% fine they'll have made more money."

I didn't originally include it, but there was a lot of demand for it. I do agree to be fair, many stadiums are deeply rooted in a club's history and the heritage of an entire area, and many do not wish to end that or at least do not want it to end up sounding really tacky (Sports Direct Arena anyone?). I'm sure the supporters organisations will recognise the financial benefits of such decisions though.   Morecambe were also forced to change their crest a few years ago because the council stopped allowing Morecambe to use the old crest. Perhaps an exception could be made for these scenarios?   Fair enough, I'll put that in.   Ticket Prices: 2a) Would the price be able to be increased by 19% every season? Or just 20% upon the previously set price?   Hmm, good point, it could just be raised 19% year on year which could amount to a lot. I'll reduce the amount, unless you have a better idea?   3) Surely a team could deem it worthwhile to set the price at say, £80, and then even with the 25% fine they'll have made more money.

In the community the big problem is the shortage of primary care services leading to long waits to access help and subsequent worsening of problems, the upcoming budget will allocate the money necessary to ensure IAPT and other primary care services can do their important work quickly and effectively.

So we see that the Rt Hon Gentlemen didn't even need clarification, as the idea was rejected immediately, by the SNP no less, and yet he now has additional clarification from the PM that this will not happen.    Again, i wasn't asking on clarification, i was asking for the Prime Minister to comment on what was said by members of the cabinet    So the Rt Hon Gentlemen should stop wasting the House's time now.   I made a follow up comment, which the Prime Minister is free to reply to or not, it is you who is wasting the house's time, and making totally unnecessary comments and totally off the wall, ridiculous comments."
MHOC,39atnq,tyroncs,3,Wed Jun 10 18:03:08 2015 UTC,"Au contraire, the Rt Hon Gentlemen's decision to behave as if he has been the recipient of some huge leak, that he is now daringly brandishing before the PM and demanding answers, has left the rest of the House woefully in the dark. Someone had to let everyone know what on Earth was going on here, as the Rt Hon Gentlemen was clearly far too obsessed with making himself seem important, knowledgeable and mysterious to enlighten them himself.  Apparently I also thought too much of the Rt Hon member, assuming he was seeking clarification on Government policy (albeit too negligent to have seen that the idea had already been rejected). But no, that would be a far too judicious and proper aim for such a person. The Rt Hon member just wanted the PM to 'comment' on a 'rumour', i.e. to attempt to get the PM to disagree with a cabinet colleague. No intention of clarifying official policy, no attempt to inform the public, i.e. no attempt to do his job. Merely pathetic attempts at engineering political hay.  The wild flinging of insults at any and all Government members, rightly bemused at the Rt Hon member's silly tactics and bizarre interpretation of a very bland event, let alone perplexing refusal to let the rest of the House know what on Earth he is on about, is only heaping yet more embarrassment on the Rt Hon member to add to his very poor week.

MHOC,39atnq,Duncs11,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:23:07 2015 UTC,"For someone who criticized me for wasting the house's time, you are carrying on with some absurd and ridiculous accusations, and totally, either intentionally or unintentionally, misconstruing this entire situation.    the Rt Hon Gentlemen's decision to behave as if he has been the recipient of some huge leak, that he is now daringly brandishing before the PM and demanding answers, has left the rest of the House woefully in the dark.    This is absolutely not what i was doing, and it is laughable that you are trying to paint it as such. I asked the Prime Minister to comment on comments made by one of the members of his cabinet, and a member of this party. Although i knew it was not going to be government policy due to the SNP leaders follow up comments, it does not excuse the fact that a Minister, and member of the Prime Ministers party said it. I thought that was notable and asked the prime minister to comment on this, apologies for asking the prime minister to comment on noteworthy and worrying things said by one of his cabinet ministers.   Someone had to let everyone know what on Earth was going on here   It may well have been a oversight on my part not to quote the whole conversation, but i had only found the subreddit moments before, and did not see the need, as i was specifically asking the prime minister to comment on something his cabinet minister had said.   the Rt Hon Gentlemen was clearly far too obsessed with making himself seem important, knowledgeable and mysterious.   You keep trying to play me as some self obsessed megalomaniac.... this is almost as bad as WhigWhams suggestions earlier. The only reason these perceptions of me exist is because of people like you making up crazed conspiracies about me.    assuming he was seeking clarification on Government policy    I assumed, that since the SNP had dismissed it, that it wouldn't be perused in the Scotland Bill, but that does not excuse the fact that a government minister, and one from the prime ministers own party proposed this. I believe it is in the public interest for the Prime Minister to comment on it.    The Rt Hon member just wanted the PM to 'comment' on a 'rumour', i.e. to attempt to get the PM to disagree with a cabinet colleague.   I wanted the Prime Minister to comment on what one of his cabinet members said, i think what they say in negotiations about a bill is important to the fundamentals of this country, so sorry for bringing that up at PMQs, since it has apparently offended you so much.    No intention of clarifying official policy, no attempt to inform the public, i.e. no attempt to do his job.   The Prime Minister obviously took the opportunity to clarify government policy, and that is his prerogative, but it is not the intention of my comment, my comment was about asking the prime minister to comment on something his minister said, which i think is important to inform the public about.    The wild flinging of insults at any and all Government members   When have i flung insults? If you really think anything iv said was intended as a insult, then you really don't know me at all.    rightly bemused at the Rt Hon member's silly tactics and bizarre interpretation of a very bland event   What interpretation? That a Government Minister said something worrying, and i asked the Prime Minister to comment on him saying it? Where s the misinterpretation?   let alone perplexing refusal to let the rest of the House know what on Earth he is on about   Again im sorry for not directly quoting and linking to the subreddit, but im not sure it really changed anything. I asked the PM to comment on something Government Ministers had said, and he did so, then you turned this into some near morgsie-level conspiracy    is only heaping yet more embarrassment on the Rt Hon member to add to his very poor week.    I am not embarrassed by this or anything that has happened this week. You have continuously misrepresented events in quite astonishing ways. Yet again this situation was very simple until you decided to make yourself center to it and complicate things.    Perhaps these insults are meant as a tribute to the ex-Leader of the Opposition   Who, Ollie? He is still Leader of the Opposition, and will continue to be until a new Tory Leader is elected?

I get that they need to keep Westminster as a strawman to knock down when things aren't going well, and that the people of Scotland have spoken. But even by the insane standards of the Scottish National Party that is amazing.  You do realise we would need to at least keep Immigration under the control of our free and democratic parliament here or else I can see a migratory wave going to Scotland (so long as they weren't from the great nation of England, of course) and then heading down south when they learn that the SNP have promised the Sun and the Stars but can not supply what the people demand."

MHOC,39atnq,whigwham,3,Wed Jun 10 20:42:51 2015 UTC,"These proposals are still at very early stages of drafting but I would suggest that the Scottish parliament would have some devolved authority over deployment roles of some specifically Scottish regiments and that only in some cases. If Holyrood opposed an intervention the Scottish regiments could be assigned a support role in that operation or to duties in a different theatre for example. Central government in Westminster would still have full control over all units in an emergency and the power to override any military decision at Holyrood if necessary in the National interest.  The details will need to be worked out and any plans in this area will, of course, come to this house before becoming law."

Like these 'emergency' powers would probably never be used, like at the moment the Prime Minister can technically take the country to war but they never would without putting it to a vote.   And we can't have the armed forces going two separate ways. Even in other federal states they don't have any provisions for regions deciding what happens to their % share in the whole country's defence force."

MHOC,392hoo,whigwham,3,Mon Jun 8 20:45:49 2015 UTC,"Do you support employees being sent to prison for five years for following orders given to them by superiors. Not only might'n they be unaware that they are breaking the law when carrying out the action, there are other reasons (such as the fear of losing their job) why they may feel forced to carry out the task.  I support the bill too, but I feel that substantial fines on the companies is enough, custodial sentences - especially for the worker - is not right. As I said elsewhere, prison is something that should be used to keep the unsafe criminals away from the general public so they may be rehabilitated, not solely as a general deterrence."
MHOC,392hoo,TheQuipton,5,Tue Jun 9 14:28:14 2015 UTC,"As I have said I think destroying good food when there is hunger is fundamentally evil.    following orders given to them by superiors   A company cannot legally ask their employees to break the law and if they did the person responsible for the request would be found guilty of law breaking.    such as the fear of losing their job   If an employee was made to fear for their job if they refused to break the law the courts would take that into account.    they be unaware that they are breaking the law when carrying out the action   Ignorance of the law is not an accepted excuse for criminal conduct.  I am not generally in favour of punitive justice at all but feel that the wanton destruction of food that others need is such a hateful, destructive and senseless crime against other humans that it should be an exception. You are right that we shouldn't need to punish people for this but that's because it is so obviously disgusting and abhorrent that it should be inconceivable that anyone could be so wicked as to do it. Unfortunately our society is sufficiently ill that the practice is now common place and I think our only option is to remind people that such behaviour is criminal in the truest sense of the word by treating it with the severity it warrants."

A truck driver cannot be expected to go through the bin in order to ascertain the fitness of the food, before he empties the bin.   This reads as if it is a mandatory sentence, with no flexibility for the courts. The other part which raises questions is "" will have to sign contracts with charities to donate this Waste to them"".  All charities have a limit on how much fresh food they can take in. What is to be done with any food the charity may not want? While these are not insurmountable problems I suggest they are address before the next reading."
MHOC,392hoo,AlbertDock,3,Mon Jun 8 20:38:16 2015 UTC,"I think ""knowingly"" would be better. On the charities bit I'd suggest "" contracts with charities to donate this Waste to them"" be changed to "" contracts with charities to make this waste available to them""."

However, I think that 2c) is very draconian and I can't help but think that a more appropriate reprimand would be community service (also 2.c.3 seems to give a compulsory 1 year custodial sentence to binmen if they unknowingly dispose of food)  If this issue is resolved then I'll be very happy to vote for this Bill."

For the purposes of this Act, a “Supermarket” shall be defined as follows; “A large shop which sells most types of food and other goods needed in the home, in which people take from shelves the things they want to buy and pay for them as they leave.”   I'm not sure how legally rigorous this is.   Those with a footprint of 4,305 sq ft (400 sq m) or more   Cumulative across the whole chain or do individual outlets have to each negotiate a deal?

Furthermore what are the limits of the food being given to charities? Could I just pitch up after the store closes each day and get myself some free and perfectly edible food?   And I realise I am rambling a bit here, but surely we would be better served by changing the rules on when supermarkets define food as being out of date etc?

MHOC,390e8j,AlbertDock,4,Mon Jun 8 16:58:39 2015 UTC,A good motion. I can't see why any reasonable person would oppose it.

MHOC,390e8j,Rabobi,6,Tue Jun 9 17:03:32 2015 UTC,I don't have an issue with working with our closest allies in regards to research but I cannot support dropping funding for what we do ourselves. Though I fail to see what is inappropriate about offensive weaponry.
MHOC,390e8j,MorganC1,3,Tue Jun 9 17:17:53 2015 UTC,"Dropping funding is a natural movement from this; we would still keep spending where it is on projects we develop by ourselves, funding would only decrease when we work with other nations, due to the split costs."
MHOC,390e8j,TheInfernalRain,3,Tue Jun 9 17:58:33 2015 UTC,"I certainly agree that we do not need to spend as much money as we currently do in military research.

MHOC,390e8j,I_miss_Chris_Hughton,2,Mon Jun 8 11:47:09 2015 UTC,"I do see the point for co-operation. Especially with our NATO allies. For example, the eurofghter and F-35 are, or are to be, mainstays of the RAF and RN FAA. However I'm concerned by the tone of this motion in regards to 'offensive' weaponry.  'This House acknowledges that this is inappropriate for the current requirement of the Armed Forces and her personnel.' this is simply a fallacy. The armed forces, as much as the left try to deny or change it, have the basic job of killing the enemies of the United Kingdom so that the United kingdom may be secure. Anything else is a bonus. This can only be achieved with offensive weaponry.  For example, although IS are not a world ending threat to the UK (as say, Hitler was), they are a threat that needs to be proportionately dealt with via limited military intervention. WEapons like the Storm Shadow missile are critical to the UK's current objectives in Iraq, and will prove critical in future interventions against abhorrent regimes like IS. Undeniably, Storm Shadow is an offensive weapon. Would the government have removed the UK funding for the weapon when it was in development?  Thats not to mention the fact that this motion is unworkable. What on earth do we define as 'offensive' and 'defensive'? It could be argued that larger tank cannons are defensive, since they allow the tank A to kill enemy tank B quicker, thus exposing the crew inside tank A to have a greater defence against death.  I am all for increased cooperation, but taking away money from the UK's offensive weaponry R&D budget when other nations are increasing theirs is incredibly dangerous"
MHOC,390e8j,Arayg,6,Mon Jun 8 14:47:30 2015 UTC,"The armed forces, as much as the left try to deny or change it, have the basic job of killing the enemies of the United Kingdom   With respect, this is an out-dated view of the roles of the military in a modern nation. The military's said aims are to provide relief and aid across the world, to enforce peace by providing a display of strength without the intention to use that strength unless in the very worst of circumstances.   Though many on the left disagree that this has been the case recently and some of us on the far left are even opposed to the concept of a military, the view you have presented is not the view of the modern military.  The capabilities of the British Armed Forces are so overwhelmingly better than those of most other nations that it seems an appropriate time to benefit from increased efficiency and less spending by sharing our R&D with other allied nations."
MHOC,390e8j,I_miss_Chris_Hughton,3,Mon Jun 8 14:51:04 2015 UTC,"I think you've confused the day-to-day job of the armed forces with their primary function, which is (and always will be) the defence of the realm. Thats why we spend a decent chunk of the budget on things like submarines, tanks and missiles despite these having no real way of 'providing aid and relief throughout the world'.  Again, I'm in support of sharing some of our R&D with allied nations, especially in terms of defensive equipment. I'm just concerned that we could end up slashing our research on offensive weaponry, a needed budget in a world like ours"
MHOC,390e8j,scubaguy194,2,Mon Jun 8 19:31:33 2015 UTC,"I would support this bill as armed forces minister. Most of our overseas military involvement is in cooperation with other NATO countries so we should work with them, spreading the load of keeping our armed forces equipped with the best equipment available.   However, I also believe that we should retain a degree of self-sufficiency."
MHOC,390e8j,MorganC1,3,Mon Jun 8 13:51:47 2015 UTC,"I thank the honourable member for his support, and I would like to reaffirm my agreement with the final statement he makes."
MHOC,390e8j,I_miss_Chris_Hughton,2,Mon Jun 8 15:54:18 2015 UTC,"I think this motion would benefit enormously from a line stating 'understanding that some technology and R&D must remain secret for security reasons, this house believes that the military should retain a veto over whether or not technology should be shared'. It would put aside a lot of my misgivings for one"
MHOC,390e8j,MorganC1,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:20:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed. However, I will give this veto over to the Ministry of Defence, and then have the motion amended via vote when the negotiation committee is created."
MHOC,390e8j,Jas1066,2,Mon Jun 8 14:46:12 2015 UTC,"I can not support this, even in principal. We are a small nation - we do not produce many products, and our population is small. The only way we can hold our place in the world is to keep in the forefront of technology. The 6th Paragraph may be correct, but it would almost certainly lead to development slowing down. Our country is world over know for its secret service. Sharing details of our latest projects with a country with less security around such matters would give any insurgents an edge - we can not have a weak link anywhere in our intelligence agencies.   This motion would not increase efficiency, but it would endanger this countries technological superiority."
MHOC,390e8j,MorganC1,3,Mon Jun 8 16:29:18 2015 UTC,"I would like to inform the honourable member that the sharing of intelligence agencies is not on the agenda at all. The only planned change here is to develop military equipment, such as Tanks, Helicopters and Frigates, in cooperation with other nations in order to reduce costs."
MHOC,390e8j,Jas1066,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:07:46 2015 UTC,"Ok, lets run through some examples:   The year is 2012. We make an agreement with Ukraine that we share scientific breakthroughs concerning Tanks. Ukraine then falls to Russia, and now Russia now has the designs for our latest Tanks.   Result: Bad   We set up an agreement with Portugal (At random) to advance our marine detection programs. We share the information that is discovered by the agreement, and go our separate ways. Then, Russian Spies in Portugal discover our new technology, and figure out how to counter it. This is due to Portugal not having a secret service to speak of, while we have an incredibly advanced one. However, because of a single weak link, the whole affair is ruined.   Result: Bad"
MHOC,390e8j,MorganC1,2,Mon Jun 8 21:09:51 2015 UTC,"Your first example relies on the unlikely chance that we make an agreement with Ukraine. Logistically, a panel of cross-party members will be negotiating these deals.  Your second example relies on Russia attacking Portugal. It also relies on us sharing intelligence R&D which I categorically ruled out in another question."
MHOC,390e8j,Jas1066,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:05:18 2015 UTC,"Ok, so for my first argument, Imagine it was Estonia Involved. And I would remind you that in 2012, nobody thought Ukraine was in any major danger.  For example 2, Russia almost certainly has spies in Portugal. The question is where they are, and weather they would have access to such information. MI5 protects us from Spies. I fear that Portugal's secret service may not be up to the Job."
MHOC,390e8j,MorganC1,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:28:45 2015 UTC,"Example 2. Like I said, anything we develop will be visible. Tanks, Frigates, Aircraft Carriers, Rifles, Grenades. If Russia wants to know how our new Frigates work under a joint R&D bill, they can look at the damn things. They are quite big. I don't know how much I have to repeat that intelligence based R&D is categorically ruled out; we will remain independent in this regard."
MHOC,390e8j,Arayg,2,Mon Jun 8 17:09:02 2015 UTC,"endanger this countries technological superiority.   I would hope that the Shadow Minister accept than in our modern age, the philosophy of nation states competing with each other has become redundant with the increased desire to pursue individuals' interests or interests of the whole human race in general. No country ought to be technologically superior to another when it means that one country's inhabitants live comfortably and one nation's inhabitants cannot get decent healthcare due to the lack of technological progress."

MHOC,390e8j,Arayg,6,Mon Jun 8 16:31:41 2015 UTC,"I am afraid that the last opinion you express is practically advocating that murder is a necesity, you hold both a position of representation as an MP and a senior position in the opposition.

I compel the electorate to consider that the government, if the honourable gentleman is anything to go by, has no back bone, and would not even commit to war if this nations sovereignty was threatened."
MHOC,390e8j,Arayg,3,Mon Jun 8 17:44:48 2015 UTC,If you are not an MP how did they let you become a Shadow Secretary of State? Forgive me I have missed a few months of MHoC during my leave of absense.  The member seems to have little regard for the value of human life. I feel this conversation can go no further. It is not a pleasing thought to know that a member of a party in opposition to this government is against the rights of the individual to life. Individual lives are something to be valued far more than your petty squabbles with othe nation states and so I treat this as a death threat against our fellow human beings. I call for the Conservative Party to reconsider his membership.

MHOC,390e8j,Jas1066,4,Mon Jun 8 15:59:52 2015 UTC,The fact is that we already cooperate with many of our allies. The Joint European Fighter is just one example.  Developing 21st century weapons is expensive and we can't afford to do it on our own.  So if we want modern weapons we have no option.
MHOC,390e8j,AlbertDock,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:04:34 2015 UTC,If we already do it then what is the point in this motion?

MHOC,390e8j,Jas1066,3,Mon Jun 8 17:17:18 2015 UTC,"Well then the cooperation should extend to all countries across the globe, not just allies. If you are going to make that argument, do you oppose NATO?"
MHOC,390e8j,Arayg,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:45:12 2015 UTC,"So you propose that we share our deepest military secrets with Russia? And if I was a complete pacifist, yes I would oppose NATO. But I'm not. I am just pointing out that there are problems with Alliances, as well as highlights. If we are the biggest Alliance, personally I see no problems with them."
MHOC,390e8j,Jas1066,3,Mon Jun 8 17:46:14 2015 UTC,"Well as it happens NATO is the most powerful alliance in the world. Deepest military secrets do not need to be shared. This R&D research sharing could cover the most simplest of research such as new ways of filtering water to make it fresh (on the spot example), which I think would be research fine to share with Russia. Military research includes a lot of technology that can be used to improve people's everyday lives and not be used as an offensive weapon."

MHOC,390ad9,MorganC1,7,Mon Jun 8 09:04:37 2015 UTC,"Of course. I feel that trade is something that should not just be done for economic benefit; trade builds relations between nations and serves to improve the prosperity of the countries trading. We should aim to trade with countries that hold ethical and moral issues in the highest regard.   Trading with countries that are known or suspected to have breached human rights regulations, amongst other factors, is something I would disapprove of."

MHOC,390ad9,MorganC1,5,Mon Jun 8 09:58:25 2015 UTC,"SME's are vital to the economy. In my childhood home town of Padstowm Cornwall, SME's were a huge part of the local economy and served to bring many young people, such as myself, into the world of work through summer jobs and fair wages. SME's are something I truly believe in and you can be rest assured, I plan to look after them in this parliament.  I would thank the honourable member for his statistic, which I did not know and truly brings the extent of importance of small business to the forefront of my mind.   During this parliament, I would like to see more market share return to SME's, to correlate the statistic you quoted, and away from big business. In this way, we can promote community based life again and move away from the profit driven world of big business."
MHOC,390ad9,demon4372,2,Mon Jun 8 15:29:29 2015 UTC,I'm glad this can be a major area of agreement between us
MHOC,390ad9,MorganC1,4,Mon Jun 8 15:40:06 2015 UTC,"Hear hear.  Mr Speaker, if you would allow it, I would like to ask the honourable member on his stance regarding Cooperatives.

MHOC,390ad9,demon4372,2,Mon Jun 8 16:10:00 2015 UTC,"I believe in a diverse and competitive market place, and i think cooperates defiantly have a place within the economy, especially with the benefits they have to workers. Although i would never support legislation that forced companies to turn into cooperates, just like i want to help and assist SMEs, i would support helping Cooperatives."
MHOC,390ad9,MorganC1,4,Mon Jun 8 16:13:45 2015 UTC,"I am glad to here that we can agree on this. It is important that we work to serve as many people as possible, hopefully we can cooperate to make this happen."

MHOC,390ad9,MorganC1,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:53:04 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the question from the Right Honourable Member.  As they may well know, I am new in my position here. I have been working on other aspects of the department in recent days and as such I have not had time to begin any major changes. However, I believe that promoting cooperatives inside our economy in order to bring power to the workers is a key focus. I will be looking to fund and give legal powers to such movements.   Specifically for SME's, I will spend some time looking into the Regional Growth Fund. I feel that investment, especially in the Quaternary Sector is very important in regions of the UK such as the South West, in order to create more jobs in these areas and inevitably bring more SME's to these areas.   Furthermore, in collaboration I will be working with the Treasury to bring forward a new system of Corporation Tax in the upcoming Budget. This system will allow businesses to reinvest profits and not get taxed on them. This will overwhelmingly benefit SME's.  I hope this has answered the Right Honourable Members question. Although you have reached your question limit, I will be happy to talk further in this chat should the Speaker allow it."
MHOC,390ad9,tyroncs,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:06:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your answers there, it does seem to give a good overview of your plans   Although you have reached your question limit   No one will notice :P  On another note, will you be looking into ways to promote having more SME's on our high streets and try and provide competition away from the larger businesses which seem to dominate them? I don't have a source but I remember seeing somewhere that 50% of the profits of independent businesses are reinvested into the local area, yet with larger cooperation's it is only 7%."
MHOC,390ad9,theyeatthepoo,5,Tue Jun 9 00:01:00 2015 UTC,Does the Secretary of State agree with me that every 'free market' is in fact created and controlled based on political and moral assumptions and that as a consequence the business policy of this government should be based around what is ethically and morally correct rather than the mistaken religious faith held by the opposition that 'free markets' do in fact exist and must be left alone to solve all ills?
MHOC,390ad9,MorganC1,3,Mon Jun 8 14:12:52 2015 UTC,"I would agree with my honourable friend. Moral and ethical considerations are paramount to trade, and must be considered above profit. It is vital to trade in an ethical and responsible way. As such, under this government we must move away from profit related trading and towards sustainable trading."

I reject the Right Honorable members blatant lie to the house, considering there are a number of Ordoliberals in the Liberal Democrats, and the party as a general does not believe in leaving markets totally along.   Infact, many members believe, like myself, that the only way you can have a free market is my having a state that ensures that it is properly regulated and competitive.   So before the Right Honorable member tried to come to this house and make such a blatant lie, in a attempt to attack the Opposition, he should at least try to get his facts straight."

MHOC,390ad9,MorganC1,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:23:40 2015 UTC,"I apologise to the Right Honourable Member, I must have missed his question.  I would agree that the current form of Corporation Tax is ineffective and represents an inefficient form of taxing business. However, Corporation Tax in itself does not have to be a deadweight loss on the economy.  Here is a passage from another answer that I hope will show you the plans for Corporation Tax reform.   What we need to do is encourage the reinvestment of profits into the economy. Dividends should be taxed, higher then they are currently. Dividends simply serve to make the rich richer. Reinvested profits serve to stimulate the economy, create jobs, invest in bottom-up business.  Alongside the Treasury, plans to reform Corporation Tax are currently in progress. This will serve to remove profits from the pockets of shareholders and invest the money in creating jobs and providing opportunities.   If the Right Honourable Member has any further questions, I would be happy to take them."
MHOC,390ad9,MorganC1,3,Mon Jun 8 08:50:46 2015 UTC,Would the ministers support regionally adjusted minimum wages so that low income workers are not completely priced out of where they live.
MHOC,390ad9,demon4372,6,Tue Jun 9 21:25:38 2015 UTC,"I would not support such a move. Regionally adjusted minimum wages are simply diverting the problem and not solving it; we need a living wage, nationally. Workers should not be priced out of where they live anywhere in the country, and all workers have the right to a wage in which they can comfortably live and enjoy life off of. Low income workers are vital to our economy and our development as a nation, and as such it is important to provide them a wage which they can live life with comfort from."
MHOC,390ad9,MorganC1,2,Mon Jun 8 09:03:13 2015 UTC,"we need a living wage, nationally.   I'd like to point out that the living wage has in effect already been established."
MHOC,390ad9,sZjLsFtA,3,Mon Jun 8 15:34:06 2015 UTC,"I would like to apologise to the honourable member, my failure to read thoroughly through previous bills is at fault here.

MHOC,390ad9,MorganC1,3,Mon Jun 8 15:48:34 2015 UTC,"Does the Secretary of State agree that it is essential that we have sufficient science funding, in particular funding of space programs (UKSA and ESA), and will be ensure that in the upcoming budgets these areas are not overlooked?"
MHOC,390ad9,sZjLsFtA,5,Mon Jun 8 16:11:52 2015 UTC,"I would agree that science funding is something that we need to put forward as one of the key areas of BIS development throughout the country.   Whilst I cannot currently comment on the status of the budget, I would like to ensure the honourable member that science funding is an area which I am particularly interested in and believe is vital to our future as a continuously developing nation. In the next few months, as I settle into my position, I hope to bring bills to the house in regards to bringing people into Science and other STEM related activities, in collaboration with the Education Secretary.  I believe that science investment is something that should be done on a co-operative basis, and not a competitive basis. Science progression works best when it is done in collaboration with as many people as possible.  Space funding is something that we should strive to increase, for space is large beyond comprehension and learning about it is the only way to develop outside of the known world. I hope to be able to bring space funding to the top of the BIS agenda through this parliament."
MHOC,390ad9,demon4372,3,Mon Jun 8 09:17:58 2015 UTC,What is the SoS opinion on the BDS movement?
MHOC,390ad9,MorganC1,5,Mon Jun 8 15:20:59 2015 UTC,"Due to my recent appointment, I have not had the time to research this specific movement. It would be unfair for me to give my honourable friend, and the house, an opinion on a matter I do not yet know enough about.  I shall research this and provide the house with a statement in the coming days."

MHOC,390ad9,Jonster123,4,Mon Jun 8 18:59:35 2015 UTC,"I would agree with the honourable member in that single-business monopolies can damage the economy and the markets they are inflicted upon due to the profit-driven nature of such businesses.   In this parliament, what I would like to see is the increase in the numbers of cooperatives. I am sure many colleagues through the house would agree with me that cooperatives serve to make large businesses and markets serve the many and not the few.  I am very happy to see the Labour Party introduce a Cooperative element to their party; it is important that we strive to promote these kind of business through funding and legal powers. In this way, the state would work to provide such funds or legal powers in order to bring monopolies or oligopolies into the hands of the consumers, customers and workers."
MHOC,390ad9,theyeatthepoo,3,Mon Jun 8 10:37:05 2015 UTC,"Would the SoS consider renegotiating with the Chinese government our current trade deals that makes sure that worker's rights in China are properly addressed along with the CCP's very poor record with Human Rights in regards of free speech, censorship and the unlawful arrests and killing of fong guang practitioners"

This will serve to remove profits from the pockets of shareholders and invest the money in creating jobs and providing opportunities.   These reforms will increase corporation tax for big business and reduce it for small business. I also would like to look into concessions for Cooperatives."

MHOC,390ad9,athanaton,3,Tue Jun 9 21:19:17 2015 UTC,I would like to inform the house that I will be returning to answer more questions in 2 hours. I am off for a kick about at the park.
MHOC,390ad9,demon4372,2,Tue Jun 9 21:39:06 2015 UTC,What is the Secretary of State's opinion on the newly formed Co-Operative party?
MHOC,390ad9,MorganC1,6,Mon Jun 8 16:37:27 2015 UTC,I am very happy to see Cooperatives being taken seriously. I hope to work alongside the Co-Operative party in order to promote co-operatives and cooperation to the forefront of British Government agenda.
MHOC,390ad9,MorganC1,2,Mon Jun 8 16:26:45 2015 UTC,"A point of note.  A prominent individual has brought it to my attention (with alarming regularity and persistence) that the secretary of state is in fact working in the newly-named Department of Business, Industry and Skills.  Please take this as a correction of the title of this MQs, as I am unable to amend it after submission."
MHOC,390ad9,MorganC1,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:44:18 2015 UTC,ehehehe
MHOC,390ad9,tyroncs,2,Tue Jun 9 08:13:31 2015 UTC,"Mr Speaker,  Does the Secretary of State agree that Free Trade is a fundamentally good idea, and a important goal in a globalized world?  And will he ensure that the government uses all its global influence both inside of the EU and in the United States to ensure that the TTIP trade deal is as good as it can possibly be, and that we do not make rash decisions before the deal has been finalized."
MHOC,390ad9,MorganC1,3,Tue Jun 9 12:49:14 2015 UTC,"Free trade can have some benefits, but in its current form I would hesitate to say it is a fundamentally good idea. However, I would like to see more ethical and moral considerations being taken into consideration, with regulations if needed. Free trade causes too much poverty at the moment, and world poverty levels need to be dropped. As a big nation, it is our duty to support this.  TTIP is another matter entirely. TTIP is something I will not stand for under any circumstance. The treaty will almost certainly lead to the creeping privatisation of public services and leave the government powerless to stop it.   I will support a TTIP deal which is drawn from scratch without creeping privatisation, without giving corporations power to sue governments, which doesn't give profits power over ethics."
MHOC,390ad9,Crazyoc,4,Mon Jun 8 08:54:37 2015 UTC,"Given the controversy surrounding the introduction of Uber in London, does the secretary of state agree with me that innovation and competition in the face of tradition is essential to a thriving economy?"
MHOC,390ad9,MorganC1,3,Mon Jun 8 19:27:11 2015 UTC,"I would certainly agree that innovation is an essential part to the development of our economy and our nation; innovation serves to move us forward as a world community. However, I would like to suggest that such innovation should be done in a cooperative mindset; competition brings winners to the table, but it also brings losers. I believe in a cooperative market that succeeds for everybody through working together.  I have already mentioned my interest in science funding and I believe this ties in here; I am 100% for innovation throughout the country. However, it must be done in an ethically and morally responsible way, through cooperation in order to allow the benefits to reach everybody and benefit everybody, not the few."

MHOC,390ad9,MorganC1,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:50:29 2015 UTC,"During this parliament, I would like to see more market share return to SME's  I would certainly agree that innovation is an essential part to the development of our economy and our nation   Most innovation and improvements in productivity and efficiency is done through large companies, so aren't these two things you have said contradicting each other?"
MHOC,390ad9,bleepbloop12345,2,Mon Jun 8 16:08:53 2015 UTC,"I would like to move away from innovation and improvements occurring through large companies. I believe in cooperation towards improvement. In this way, I will look to bring cooperatives to the forefront of the economy.   As well as this, I believe that STEM projects should have more government interest and involvement; for example, I believe the government should be involved more throughout the pharmaceutical industry. The competitive production of drugs for profit is not a sustainable idea."
MHOC,390ad9,MorganC1,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:54:49 2015 UTC,"Would the Secretary of State agree with me that Corporation Tax should be lowered slightly, to help the British Economy grow quicker?"
MHOC,390ad9,tyroncs,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:08:46 2015 UTC,"I would disagree with you in that lower Corporation Tax is a viable idea to help the British Economy grow. What we need to do is encourage the reinvestment of profits into the economy. Dividends should be taxed, higher then they are currently. Dividends simply serve to make the rich richer. Reinvested profits serve to stimulate the economy, create jobs, invest in bottom-up business.   Alongside the Treasury, plans to reform Corporation Tax are currently in progress. This will serve to remove profits from the pockets of shareholders and invest the money in creating jobs and providing opportunities. As well as this, I wish to reform the Regional Growth Fund. Whilst plans for this are in their early stages, I wish to place more focus on developing infrastructure to bring business to other parts of the country. Investment in Quaternary activites, such as STEM business and Space Programs are parallel to taking skilled workers out of the south east and spreading them across the country.  Hopefully I will be able to expand upon my plans to stimulate the economy in collaboration with the Treasury soon enough; however that will not involve lower Corporation Tax in its current form."

If this motion is passed by the House, what's next Mr Deputy Speaker? Are we going to offer British citizenship to every American, Canadian, Australian or New Zealander because of their British heritage? They still hold British values and culture, and they have ancestors from here, so what's the difference?  Perhaps, Mr Deputy Speaker, we should suggest to Nordic governments that those in this country that are descended from Anglo-Saxon Germanic tribes we offered Danish or Norwegian citizenship? Surely we have some connection to it?  Without any demands from the people of Welsh Argentina for this happen, this is an utterly preposterous motion that undermines their Argentine status, and I will be voting against it."

It seems to be quite logistically difficult. Also, I'm not too sold on the idea of giving descendants of Welsh people from 150 years ago citizenship, just because their great great grandparents left Wales. Many of these people probably have very little in the way of ties to Britain itself.

Is there evidence they claim to be British? Is there evidence they are persecuted?  Again, apologies if my statements are misinformed because I genuinely do not know, but it seems like this motion is 130 or so years late. Whilst the original settlers may have wished for independence and British citizenship, it appears this motion is attempting to rectify this mistake by giving people citizenship who do not want it. The people there now seem to be firmly Argentinian, not British.  EDIT: Also, why is it up to the UK to rectify a mistake we didn't make? I could understand a motion pressuring the Argentinian government to make a change, but this seems like a huge overstepping of our powers. How does giving them citizenship actually affect anything you've mentioned as well? Would they not still be persecuted? They still wouldn't have their land."

While they may have Welsh language and traditions they are now ultimately Argentine citizens and have been for multiple generations.  While I would support better relationships between us and the Argentine Government this would ultimately cause the descendents and us more unrest.  While the gesture may seem nice it's rather random.
MHOC,38x7lx,thewriter1,5,Sun Jun 7 23:19:09 2015 UTC,Is there any evidence that they want British citizenship?

The people who left over a century ago are not the people who will be receiving citizenship, and most likely the people receiving citizenship will have never met those people.

It also still doesn't affect my point that the people who speak Welsh are in the overwhelming minority.    it is hoped that this motion will reinforce this.   Are we giving them British citizenship in the hope that maybe they will learn Welsh and become more integrated with Welsh culture?
