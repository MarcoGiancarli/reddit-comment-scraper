s6photography,3dcrdz,Moseszator,2,Wed Jul 15 17:13:08 2015 UTC,"""RAW is a file format that captures all image data recorded by the sensor when you take a photo. When shooting in a format like JPEG image information is compressed and lost.""  Basically you can edit the photo and the different color saturations after the photo is taken, and sometimes the results are spectacular. Most professional photographers shoot in RAW format instead of JPG. The tradeoff is that RAW files are huge, sometimes as big as 20mb."
