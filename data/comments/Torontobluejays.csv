Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,cbarone1,17,Tue Jul 21 14:29:05 2015 UTC,"That is a pair you go all in on.  Edit: I'm not necessarily advocating it, just that it's a great all in pair."
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,allirow,5,Tue Jul 21 14:38:18 2015 UTC,"Why would the Jays want Cespedes? He's what they have a glut of already, right handed power. He adds nothing to the team."
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,Garrison_Creeker,8,Tue Jul 21 16:21:47 2015 UTC,"Flipping Edwin for Cespedes might not be the worst idea, Jays get a younger bat and more versatile on the field as well. With the way Smoak and Colabello been playing 1B and how disastrous LF has been all year, Cespedes is the perfect fit.  David Price will cost the Jays a lot, not sure they should pull that trade unless we can lock him down"
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,BSHU91,5,Tue Jul 21 16:31:57 2015 UTC,Tigers won't do it with V-Mart and Cabrera
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,Snidernomore,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:32:38 2015 UTC,"I just hope if a trade does go down for the Jays...it'll involve Edwin instead of Stroman/Norris/Sanchez/Hoffman, can't keep giving up our pitching prospects aka Dickey trade"
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,BSHU91,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:15:40 2015 UTC,Edwin has 10/5 rights and can't be traded unless he agrees to it which seems highly unlikely. In order to get players to help at the big league level then you have to give up prospects.
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,TangoMyMango,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:29:44 2015 UTC,"Cespedes is half the hitter EE is. Wouldn't do that trade ever.  Edit: To add to this  You aren't going to trade EE for another right handed bat period. The only way you trade edwin is if you get a lefty bat back or really, you get pitching."
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,Garrison_Creeker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:40:47 2015 UTC,"I agree the Jays need pitching big time, I am just saying if anyone that gets packaged I hope its EE"
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,BSHU91,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:16:44 2015 UTC,"I gotta disagree with you here. EE has been struggling this year. Right now, Cespedes is the better batter. On top of that, he plays left field which has been a sore spot all season for the Jays defensively. This would give you the opportunity to move Collabello to the DH position and get someone who is actually able to play left field."
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,BieksasBro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:15:32 2015 UTC,On no planet I know is Cespedes a better hitter than EE.  Seriously
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,Garrison_Creeker,3,Tue Jul 21 17:32:29 2015 UTC,"There sure are a lot of downvotes around here. The past three years, EE has been better, but this year he has returned to his pre-2012 numbers. This could be a blip, or he could be on the wrong side of thirty and facing a long decline.  I wouldn't really say that either of them is the better batter overall, but Cespedes is a few years younger and looking pretty solid this season. I don't know if it would be a huge improvement to swap one for the other."
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,superbad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:36:09 2015 UTC,The biggest improvement in an EE for Cespedes swap would be outfield depth and defense and overall positional flexibility.   But I'd still take Edwin and his parrot...even in a down year he's still a bigger threat to go deep. I just think he's been playing in the field a bit too much and would benefit from some rest or more time at DH
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,thursday51,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:05:29 2015 UTC,"I just think he's been playing in the field a bit too much and would benefit from some rest or more time at DH   Well that's a specious argument. So far this year he's played almost as many games at DH as he did the entire season last year. In 126 starts last year, he was at 1st for 78 (61.9%), DH for 46 (36.5%), and LF for 2 (1.5%). In 86 starts this year, he's played 1st for 48 (55.8%) and DH for 38 (30.1%)*  *Percentages each season add up to 99.9% due to rounding of numbers."
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,thursday51,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:53:31 2015 UTC,"Right...which is why we went out and acquired Smoak to replace Lind, so EE could take the majority of the DH ABs this year. Of course with Navarro taking a large number of ABs at DH Gibby has had to play Edwin at first more than they originally planned coming out of sprint training."
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,kapacj,2,Tue Jul 21 21:02:36 2015 UTC,"That's not true. He adds more right handed power. Sure they have tons already, but he still makes the team better and makes our offense even more ridiculous."

Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,_Putin_,10,Tue Jul 21 19:03:36 2015 UTC,I'd agree if they were on long term contracts but I don't like the idea of giving up many prized assets for a half season rental.
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,juliusseizure,2,Tue Jul 21 15:04:55 2015 UTC,"I would pass on Cespedes with out offence but get Price. On the other hand, if the combined package is cheaper than the parts, all in is fine by me!"
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,ilikehockey2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:08:50 2015 UTC,"not sure about Cespedes. he's more name than anything else – career .315 OBP, his speed has vanished and with a BABIP 30 points higher this year than his career mark, we'd be overpaying for some considerable luck this season (to date). i mean, he's not terrible; hits for power and plays solid d – but he's not the kind of player i'd want to raid our minor league system for. plus he's a righty."
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,Whalez,4,Tue Jul 21 16:01:26 2015 UTC,We definitely don't need cespedes.

Seriously tho I think the Tigers making this guy available will drive down the asking price of Cueto, Hamels, Samardzija, which is good news for the jays. Personally I'd love to see a deal involving Fiers and Braun from the Brewers for Norris, Navarro and maybe Alford"
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,ImArcherVaderAMA,5,Tue Jul 21 14:49:50 2015 UTC,DO THAT deal all fucking day. See what it'll take to get Gomez and I will buy a beer for as many fans I can outside Rogers Centre one gamr

Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,thedudeyousee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:09:39 2015 UTC,that the person who caught you is an anti-Semite   Huh? The only thing I heard is that Braun thought the sample was mishandled and the handler incompetent. Either way he worked to get the guy fired which is an a-hole move. It's just not any different than the other liars in MLB to me.
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,TheGursh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:36 2015 UTC,the anti-Semite accusations are pretty well referenced on Wikipedia. Ideally i wouldn't have any PED abuser on the team but I think Ryan Braun and A-Rod are in a class of their own as the worst offenders in the game currently.
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,thedudeyousee,2,Tue Jul 21 18:18:36 2015 UTC,"From both the Wikipedia sources, ""A source close to Dino Laurenzi Jr., the test collector, said the anti-Semitism allegation is untrue"" so I wouldn't judge him on false allegations (even if he may not deserve the benefit of the doubt) as they appear to be baseless. But ya he's a cheater and liar who tried to ruin the collector's life to save his own hide."

Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,Funkagenda,6,Tue Jul 21 15:09:50 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling that if we do trade for Price, Anthopolous would require it to be a sign-and-trade deal. He's not going to sell the farm for two-three months of Price when it doesn't guarantee postseason success."

Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,ImArcherVaderAMA,3,Tue Jul 21 14:38:17 2015 UTC,I still want to get a guy for more than this year. It's hard for us to get free agents. A quality starter with this lineup and Stroman will be a good team. That said the division is up for grabs and other teams will get stronger in in the division and this guy is the type of dominant stud to ride through the postseason. We also need one one more arm somehow. Even dreaming of this I can't think that Price-Buhrle-Hutch-Dickey works in September.
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,visualize_and_attack,2,Tue Jul 21 15:13:08 2015 UTC,Streams should be back in September. He's already throwing the ball in rehab.
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,BlackwaterProject,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:54:11 2015 UTC,"I would't count on it, as touching as his instagram photos are of all his rehab work its the end of July and he is no where close to a mound and would still need a few minor league starts to get stretched out. He will in no way shape or form be part of the starting rotation this (post)season. He may work himself into a bullpen role late but even at that I can't expect the same guy as I did last year or hope to see next year."

There isn't a chance he will give up valuable young arms for a rental, this is not the 92 jays.  That move could put us behind 5 or 6 years. If anything I see him adding a end of the rotation starter with term and not have to give up much value."
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,WalterDwight,4,Tue Jul 21 16:10:29 2015 UTC,"I agree.   If, assuming he was telling the truth, AA wasn't looking at rentals as option #1 then I don't see the most expensive rental suddenly becoming the Jays target."
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,mcmadbat,3,Tue Jul 21 16:58:51 2015 UTC,something to consider is that there is speculation that his job might be on the line.
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,Corzare,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:32:15 2015 UTC,He'd still have to run any huge deal by ownership for approval. I'm assuming that someone knows something about baseball up there and wouldn't let AA completely drain the farm for a short-term fix.
Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,UglyMuffins,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:20:28 2015 UTC,"Many Jays players spoke up last year after no help was acquired to make a playoff push, so that's one reason he'd go for a rental this year."

Torontobluejays,3e2p9j,BigAppleBag,2,Tue Jul 21 15:20:42 2015 UTC,"Fiers and Braun would be the absolute perfect deal.

Torontobluejays,3e2ns6,Watt-wake,7,Tue Jul 21 14:17:07 2015 UTC,"I'll do my best for you.  The Blue Jays have the #1 offence in all of baseball. We have scored more than 80 runs more than the Yankees who are the second most productive offence.  Our pitching has been an issue all season. At the beginning of the season our starting pitching was struggling and our bullpen was doing okay. Now our starting pitching is okay and our bullpen is struggling. Except Bo Schultz and Roberto Osuna who are both new to the team this year and playing as well as we could hope.  Josh Donaldson, who we picked up in the offseason in a blockbuster trade, has been our best player all around. He is in talks about getting the MVP for the American League should the BlueJays make the playoffs.  The General Manager has said that they are going to try and make some big moves to help the pitching.  Jays fans are praying that we somehow land an Ace as we don't really have a guy that can come out every single game and dominate. Although Mark Buerhle has been doing that his past 8 starts only allowing 1.55 earned runs per 9 innings over that span which is tops in the AL.  Many people, not just jays fans, believe that if Toronto picks up 1-2 solid pitchers before the deadline that we will be a serious contender in the playoffs.    Also, every Jays fan is hopeful that Marcus Stroman will return to the team in September. He was injured in spring training and looks hopeful to return. He is the best pitcher on the team and was supposed to be our Ace.   That's all I have for now, feel free to ask questions and I should be able to answer them."
Torontobluejays,3e2ns6,visualize_and_attack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:15:31 2015 UTC,"If we could trade for a top of the rotation arm (pipe dream) and Stroman could return, our pitching suddenly and drastically goes from mediocre to very, very solid.   Ace - Buerhle - Estrada - Hutchison - Dickey   Sanchez - Osuna - Stroman - Cecil - Schultz - Loup - Hendricks"

Torontobluejays,3e2ns6,nocturnal_goatsucker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:26:11 2015 UTC,"Well, baseball is a great sport to start following at any time. Welcome home.  the Jays are a .500 team at the moment that is under-performing. They are playoff capable, but perhaps not playoff calibure.  I would imagine that the next 7-10 games will decide if they are buyers or sellers at the July 31st non-waiver trade deadline  Offensive: Historically good for this franchise, although it has been less consistent in July. They can hit 1-9, the have some speed and probably the best 3-4-5 power hitters in the league. (Donaldson-Bautista-Encarnacion)  Defense: Mediocre, other than Kevin Pillar the team has had mostly sub-par or expected defense.  Starting Pitching: The Starting pitching had a horrendous April and have since been adequate. The Jays are looking to add a controllable 2-4 starter to the rotation to fill the revolving door AAA spot currently occupied by Felix Dubront. Current media darling is Mike Fiers of the Brewers.  Relief Pitching: The bullpen was a dumpster Fire for a while. Roberto Osuna, Bo Shultz, Ryan Tepera have all been no expectation spring invites that have worked out nicely.  Aaron Sanchez was recently moved into the bullpen for the remainder of the year and will likely factor into late inning/high leverage situations. Brett Cecil has been the biggest disappointment, although, I don't believe we should have had the expectations we had of him.  Notable injuries: Marcus Stroman was expected to be our Ace and some see him as the future leader of this team. from a distance he seems like a great person with a passion for life and he has some pretty nasty pitches. Oh... and he likes to chew gum.  Michael Saunder who was traded to the Jays for J Happ in the offseason was expected to play left field and contribute some offense to the team.  Jose Bautista has been dealing with a shoulder injury due to an overthrow to first base against the orioles. He has had the cannon he's had in previous years, although, teams still haven't run on him. True sign of respect.  All in all, even if they Jays don't make a move, or don't make the playoffs the brightest light in this organization is the potential crop of young starters that will begin appearing as soon as September and next spring."

Torontobluejays,3e1er5,Modern_Man_,3,Tue Jul 21 05:28:05 2015 UTC,Yeah you should be hitting the border pretty early. Game starts at 1pm. It will take you at the they very least 5-6 hours.
Torontobluejays,3e1er5,BieksasBro,4,Tue Jul 21 06:18:02 2015 UTC,You can check online at the Canada immigration website. They will give you updates on how long border lineups are. Going at avg speeds it will probably take you about 3-3.5 hours to get to Seattle. The last game I watched in Seattle was for the seahawks last season. Sunday game at 1pm and we got to the border around 7:30-8 am. Took us about 35 minutes go get through the border and parked at the stadium around 11:45 am. The earlier you leave the easier it is to find parking and get through the border so its really on you. As soon as the game finished we basically left and only stopped 2 times once to get gas and the other for food. Got home at about 7-8pm. I might be buying tickets for the game myself. Thinking about getting them behind the Jays dugout. I hope other Jays fans are there too.

Torontobluejays,3dzh0k,gandalfsnutsack,3,Mon Jul 20 23:18:27 2015 UTC,The point is that he's a controllable pitcher who likely won't cost much in assets. It's a good deal regardless of where they are in the standings.
Torontobluejays,3dzh0k,Royal_Flush13,2,Tue Jul 21 00:02:23 2015 UTC,He's a controllable pitcher with good peripherals. Why do you assume he won't cost much in assets?

Torontobluejays,3dzh0k,gandalfsnutsack,2,Tue Jul 21 00:38:39 2015 UTC,"Well he's a non-prospect and already 30. And even if he costs a lot in absolute terms, you're likely getting more ""bang for your buck"" than the equivalent price for an ace rental."
Torontobluejays,3dzh0k,Royal_Flush13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:50:40 2015 UTC,If's he's already 30 then we can't assume he's going to be good for the duration of team control left and unless we give up something decent I don't see why the Brewers move him.

Torontobluejays,3dzh0k,AF1991,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:53:59 2015 UTC,"I would love this package. We need one more OF, cause LF isn't doing it. Move pillar to LF and have Gomez CF or either or. Fiers is a solid starter. I would love to see AA make this happen."
Torontobluejays,3dzh0k,tylershields4L,2,Tue Jul 21 02:43:08 2015 UTC,"Send Edwin + for Gomez Fiers and Smith. Gomez moves to left, keep pillar in center because it's better defensively. And now we have no holes defensively, in our line up or in bullpen with an okay rotation."
Torontobluejays,3dzh0k,EverythingOP,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:53:03 2015 UTC,Do we think Edwin would accept a trade there though? Cause he can say yes or no.

Torontobluejays,3dzh0k,cloud_28,2,Tue Jul 21 00:08:26 2015 UTC,I'd rather move Norris. Sanchez can help us out in the bullpen right now.

If he was on the rotation all season, he'd be the Jays 3rd best starter, behind Mark Buehrle (1.5 fWAR), and Drew Hutchison (1.6 fWAR).  And we'd have him for $500k next season, before arbitration starts for 3 years past that.  Is it a huge Cueto style deal?  No, but it's one that no question benefits the team this year, and next.  Not just by adding a stable arm, but by not blowing the farm system."

Torontobluejays,3dzh0k,BinaryChode,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:48:30 2015 UTC,If we can add Cueto and a good controllable arm I'm all over it.  I just don't want to go all in on only rentals.

In 2-3 years you'll have what  Sanchez, Stroman, Norris, Hoffman maybe not all of those make it, maybe one or two gets tommy John or some other injury like we saw with Stroman this year. By then Jose Bautista will be 36-37, EE will be 35, Donny - 33. Personally I would go for it now but that's just my opinion."
Torontobluejays,3dzh0k,allirow,2,Mon Jul 20 23:37:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Go for it, AA. I'm sick of this constant overhyping of our prospects.   Chances are Fiers is better than what Hoffman will ever be. Hoffman can't strike out guys in single A as a 22 year old against bad hitters. Fiers has been K-ing his entire minor league career.   This gross overvaluing of prospects is what keeps us in the AL East basement. Remember Drabek?  How many times did people say he was untouchable."

If it's a ""gamble either way"" (as you say) then you should be agreeable to try a rental for a change. They need to give it a shot once in a while. Prospects come and go, but being in contention in late July or August is a pretty rare occurrence for this franchise."
Torontobluejays,3dzh0k,cozeners,0,Mon Jul 20 22:23:17 2015 UTC,"If we go for it the team will need more than one Cueto. We'll be moving Norris, Hoffman, Castro, Pompey, Dwight Smith JR, Labourt and Reid-Foley to get 2 starters."

Torontobluejays,3dzh0k,allirow,8,Tue Jul 21 04:05:42 2015 UTC,I would say he is better than mediocre. He's not a difference maker but he would improve our current line up.
Torontobluejays,3dzh0k,senseandmeasure,2,Mon Jul 20 20:12:58 2015 UTC,"At best he's somewhere between 2014 Drew Hutchison and 2014 Marcus Stroman.  At worst, he's 2015 Marco Estrada."
Torontobluejays,3dzf14,mcmadbat,17,Mon Jul 20 19:47:57 2015 UTC,"I'm torn. I see the current line up as is and feel like they're one major piece and two big pieces away from being world beaters...and I just want to see them win!!!  But then you look at the talent in the minors, all seeming to coalesce around 2017-2019 and you envision a rotation of studs with some real live arms in the pen with positional players with real tools coming in to help the vets and MVP candidates we'd still have on payroll...  Honestly, I wouldn't want to be in AAs shoes...no matter which way he goes people will be howling. Make a trade? Great, you just mortgaged our future you asshat! Stand pat? How could you not make a move to take advantage of the weak east? Don't you have confidence in your team???   I think the best way to do it would be to swallow hard and cough up the prospects required to get reliable arms with some team control left, and add somebody like Bruce or Revere to the outfield. But for that you really need to find the ideal trade partner and that is going to be hard..."
Torontobluejays,3dzf14,thursday51,10,Mon Jul 20 20:28:25 2015 UTC,"I am with you. AA is in a very tough spot. Bautista, EE and Reyes will all be a year older and we're already seeing regression (EE at the plate, Reyes in the field) which says GO NOW. On the other point we have some good youngsters in Donaldson, Pillar, Stroman, Sanchez, Osuna and some other young arms that will be coming to fruition. 1 month ago I would've said go for it, but now I'm not so sure.  EDIT: It's worth mentioning that Dickey is pitching well now and with Buerhle and Estrada playing very legit we could use one more arm there and have Hutch in the 5 spot (never know what you'll get)."
Torontobluejays,3dzf14,ilikehockey2,2,Mon Jul 20 20:35:19 2015 UTC,I think edwin is just injured honestly. that lingering shoulder issue seems to be sapping his power and contact
Torontobluejays,3dzf14,poopsmith666,6,Tue Jul 21 17:35:21 2015 UTC,I have my preferences but frankly I respect the difficult situation AA is in and what ever direction he goes in I'll be supportive of. I would just expect that if he goes for it this year he still leaves something in the cupboards for the future because even a big deal doesn't guarantee we even make the playoffs right now and if we don't see the post-season again this year I don't want to have to wait another 5-10 years for them to rebuild again.
Torontobluejays,3dzf14,darth-helmet,7,Mon Jul 20 20:56:24 2015 UTC,I'm glad it's AA's decision and not mine.
Torontobluejays,3dzf14,allirow,5,Mon Jul 20 23:43:35 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that we're in this position because we fell into Bautista and Encarnacion. Bautista had basically been relegated into a utility player, and we had let EE go, only to get him back when Oakland DFA'd him as well. Because we got lucky with them, we kind of got forced into going all in with trades a few years ago, because the farm wasn't ready yet."
Torontobluejays,3dzf14,cbarone1,2,Mon Jul 20 23:13:41 2015 UTC,We do have a decent amount of pitching prospects but in terms of position players we have next to nothing in the upper minors. Lower level prospects don't pan out more often than not.

That comes along once maybe every 40-50 years.    If you're not going to make a move now, when?  Bolster that rotation and shore up the bullplen at all costs IMO.  Only Stroman should be untouchable unless we somehow get a stud pitcher with a long-term deal in place."
Torontobluejays,3dzf14,brownmagician,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:06:14 2015 UTC,"I think the offence has nowhere to go but up.  Other than Pillar and Travis who is having a once in a career year? Maybe Collabello but hes not a full time guy. Donaldson is exactly what we expected him to be.  Both Joses and Edwin are having down years, we dont have Saunders at all Martin  is havimg an ok year but nothing to write home about.  They could have an even better offence next year if thise big 3 can come back to normal.  In AA we trust"

Torontobluejays,3e0moh,treilly19,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:24:29 2015 UTC,It's definitely more expensive. $37.99 US on the MLB shop. That's $49 and some change Canadian. With shipping it's probably still less than at the Jays shop but that's just the way it usually is when buying merch at a park. They price on your willingness to spend during the experience. You're probably more willing to spend some extra dough while you're in the thick of the excitement at the park than if you just walk into a store and spot a $50 hat.

Torontobluejays,3e1nnq,imtoocoldforthisshit,6,Tue Jul 21 13:00:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, but I don't envy AA. He's got some tough choices to make. He has loads of what look like they will turn into great MLB pitching coming up. So do you trade some future all-stars for a pitcher for now, or do you risk it and hope you can find some bats later when the pitcher are ready to go, even though you have the bats now but not the pitching."
Torontobluejays,3e1nnq,jrad151,2,Tue Jul 21 09:48:01 2015 UTC,"We lead the league in runs scored by a lot. That's not something that can be repeated easily.

Torontobluejays,3e1nnq,missspiritualtramp,2,Tue Jul 21 13:19:03 2015 UTC,"EE and Bautista are both getting up there and have some plaguing injuries, you'd have to find a team that's in bad need of a DH and RF right away to trade any worthwhile prospects."

Torontobluejays,3e1nnq,Mapleleaf97,7,Tue Jul 21 11:24:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, but to my mind it would be very short sighted to do it and give up what could be a very strong core in the near future.

Torontobluejays,3e1nnq,Seffer,5,Tue Jul 21 13:01:29 2015 UTC,I don't think so because we are not even in that great a position to compete even in our own division.  If we were a bigger Gulf between the teams in the al East i would agree but the current team just has not proved enough to force aa hand.
Torontobluejays,3e1nnq,darth-helmet,2,Tue Jul 21 10:28:27 2015 UTC,I wouldn't use the word perfect. It's a good time to go in and more accurately it's the most appropriate time the Jays have had in many years but we're still 4.5 games out and in no way looking like a sure shot for the playoffs also it's very debatable if they are just a piece or two away from being serious world series contenders.
Torontobluejays,3e1nnq,mcmadbat,2,Tue Jul 21 12:52:49 2015 UTC,I think its time for a big run. Just making the playoffs would make the next 3 years of rebuilding worth it for me.

Torontobluejays,3e1nnq,jy_am,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:00:30 2015 UTC,"For this club the acquisition of David Cone in 1992 is probably seen as the gold standard of deadline-day moves. By that point the Blue Jays already had a solid core team that won a pennant the previous season, and they made some big-name signings in the offseason [Jack Morris, Dave Winfield] to strengthen what was already a pretty good team to start with.  You could argue that the Cone acquisition helped put them over the top, although when they traded for him the club was already 18 games above .500 and leading the AL East by 2½ games.  I think one acquisition may be enough to sneak into the playoffs, if everything falls the right way, but I think they're still far from being a legit championship contender this season. Not sure if it's worth sacrificing the prospects it would cost for that late-season acquisition."

Torontobluejays,3e1nnq,davehasopinions,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:38 2015 UTC,"This week will tell us a lot, and may be the key to AA deciding to go all-in or not. West Coast trips have historically been not great (read: apocalyptically terrible) for us, and with the O's taking on the Yanks and Rays, this week has a lot of potential for a team to separate itself.  A 4-2 or (dare to dream) 5-1 trip while the other guys beat each other up could convince AA (and Rogers?) that the time truly is now."

Torontobluejays,3dyj35,rustyarrowhead,4,Mon Jul 20 19:08:41 2015 UTC,"The problem is, the AL East is so bunched up trading for a starter doesn't guarantee shit. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. The Os have a great offense and decent enough pitching and the Yankees have good starting pitching and an overachieving offense, powered by resurgent Texiera and Arod. And we're not the only one poised to be buyers. It's kind of an impossible choice - you want to compete but you don't want to have another loaiza type situation."
Torontobluejays,3dyj35,jaysrapsleafs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:11:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely. IMHO, the rotation is OK, but the Jays need to add another arm to the back end of the bullpen."
Torontobluejays,3dyj35,jaysrapsleafs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:14:54 2015 UTC,"Well I don't have a lot of confidence in Dubront - he hasn't had enough opportunity to show that we can count on him. Sanchez is close to being back but they want him in the pen, at least at first (which, he should do well in). The problem with the rotation isn't just Dubront, however, it's the inconsistency of Hutch. And it's not like we're gonna replace his spot."

Torontobluejays,3dyj35,mcmadbat,6,Mon Jul 20 20:13:12 2015 UTC,I would contend that most lopsided wins in trades have a component of luck in it.
Torontobluejays,3dyj35,allirow,2,Mon Jul 20 20:15:16 2015 UTC,Damn skippy.
Torontobluejays,3dyj35,GoodOneRandy,0,Mon Jul 20 20:47:54 2015 UTC,"Hopefully history repeats itself with AA, pretty impressive deadline track record."
Torontobluejays,3dyj35,allirow,5,Mon Jul 20 18:21:27 2015 UTC,"Rasmus, Escobar, Happ, and Delabar were all deadline deals for spare parts."
Torontobluejays,3dyj35,allirow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:32:36 2015 UTC,"They weren't 'blockbuster' deals.  AA has a habit of not adding much during the season, instead choosing to add depth as the year goes on, or buy low on former high end players.  He traditionally saved his big wheeling and dealing for the off-season."
Torontobluejays,3dyj35,AnnalisaPetrucci,0,Mon Jul 20 19:30:19 2015 UTC,"Uhm, what?  There's absolutely nothing AA has done at the deadline that can be classified as impressive."
Torontobluejays,3dyj35,GoodOneRandy,2,Mon Jul 20 20:12:45 2015 UTC,"Escobar, Gose for Wallace, Valencia and Rasmus are all wins, and he doesn't have any bad trades."
Torontobluejays,3dyj35,TangoMyMango,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:49:22 2015 UTC,"I think it is the fact that while none of the trades were terrible, they were not that impressive. Not a lot of the players acquired lasted for a while on the team or contributed a lot. Even if they were wins, they were small wins."
Torontobluejays,3dyj35,GoodOneRandy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:24:17 2015 UTC,"Personally I base trades on the value of the players at the time of the deal, not the results. I am a huge fan of both the Rasmus and Escobar trades, both moves were genius even though both guys are gone. Old, average SS for one of the best young SS in the game at the time, and Rasmus was also one of the most highly regarded young outfielder in baseball, and we didn't give up very much for him."
Torontobluejays,3dyj35,AnnalisaPetrucci,-3,Mon Jul 20 18:49:40 2015 UTC,"Winning a trade doesn't mean it's impressive.   All AA has done at a deadline is trade for bench players, iffy bullpen arms, and a 5th starter."
Torontobluejays,3dyj35,GoodOneRandy,3,Mon Jul 20 19:11:37 2015 UTC,"Winning a trade doesn't mean it's impressive.   I disagree.   All AA has done at a deadline is trade for bench players, iffy bullpen arms, and a 5th starter.   Rasmus/Escobar are not bench players, plus they both had a lot more value at the time of the trade. Both very impressive deals, picking up two of the (at the time) better young players in baseball for very little, by buying low on them."
Torontobluejays,3dyj35,AnnalisaPetrucci,-2,Mon Jul 20 19:59:37 2015 UTC,"So winning a trade = impressive? Wow, your standard of evaluation is low.  And did either of Rasmus or Escobar pan out? Rasmus, hell no. Escobar, not really.  Not making much of a case for AA having an eye for acquiring significant talent at the deadline.  He absolutely has been a dud when it comes to the MLB deadline and his track record in regards to trades have been questionable. Nothing is impressive when all you've acquired is essentially ""depth"" players as opposed to the big fish that the Jays desperately need.  If depth deals are now impressive then I guess there's 29 other GMs who are also impressive masters of managing."
Torontobluejays,3dyj35,GoodOneRandy,2,Mon Jul 20 19:56:28 2015 UTC,"Both Rasmus and Escobar are above average MLB every day players.   And I don't care they aren't still with us, they gave us good value when they were here, and at the time of the trade the perceived value was easily in Toronto's favour on both deals. Very, very impressive deals, as we also only gave up spare parts.   My point is AA has a track record (unlike previous GMs) of not losing trades, but winning most. All 9 of those trades worked out fine for the Blue Jays, with 2 major wins imo."

Torontobluejays,3dv40h,illmatic2112,3,Sun Jul 19 20:43:24 2015 UTC,"It depends. I once had great seats, two or three rows behind the ""in the action seats"" right behind home plate. These three fat dudes in front of me would stand up during pretty much every single play, blocking all of the action. There is almost no slope to the section at that point, so you really can't see over them at all.  I had to keep asking them to sit down. I paid a lot of money for those seats. I want to see the damn game!"

Torontobluejays,3dv40h,Ruckol1,3,Sun Jul 19 23:12:25 2015 UTC,Decent chance that Dickey is gone as well.

Torontobluejays,3dv40h,e8ghtmileshigh,2,Mon Jul 20 02:26:43 2015 UTC,The only way we will get the type of starter we need is by letting Dickey and Buehrle go first and then using their money to go after a stud so Stroman can slot in as a number 2 next season. I don't believe for a second Rogers has made funds available for a legit run. Papelbon would be our closer right now if Rogers wasn't forcing AA to nickle and dime the Phillies. When FA rolls around we are going hard after Price.
Torontobluejays,3dv40h,OlympicHockey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:45:58 2015 UTC,"It is vaguely possible that Buehrle will be back, and if he signs for one year, it won't be $20 million."

Torontobluejays,3du3sz,JayFan7941,7,Sun Jul 19 19:22:59 2015 UTC,"Estrada's back to back close games had me cautiously optimistic, then his following where he only lasted ~2 innings brought me back down to earth.  But Buck made some great points regarding his performance off proper rest, and today is another testament to that.  He also is facing a team that he faced not long ago.  I think he should be given a rotation spot even with Sanchez back, and make it his to lose. This also gives us a much needed boost in the pen."
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,Ruckol1,4,Sun Jul 19 19:15:28 2015 UTC,Estrada took Norris' spot in the rotation. Sanchez spot is currently being held by Felix Doubront. Do you want Doubront in before sanchez? If not where does the boost in the pen  come from? Felix?

Torontobluejays,3du3sz,ArminscopyofSwank,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:12:34 2015 UTC,"just reading through MLBTR, I would be very interested in what Gerrardo Parra might offer for the Blue Jays. if you could flip Collabello (unlikely, though maybe in a package) and a middle-tier prospect for him, he would shore up our outfield nicely (and add a nice bench piece if Sanders outplays him). much more reliable than Collabello and renowned for solid defense. under control until the end of next season. there's few places on offence this team could upgrade but that's one longer-term add I'd be happy with."
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,rustyarrowhead,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:12:20 2015 UTC,I was mistaken - I thought he was under control for 2016 as well. pretty much kills my interest.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,rustyarrowhead,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:23:47 2015 UTC,"I think our outfield could be an issue in 2016. Pillar is no guarantee in my mind, Pompey is still a work in progress offensively, and Saunders is either gone or a question mark."
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,rustyarrowhead,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:27:23 2015 UTC,What would Milwaukee want Collabello for?  He's been awesome this year but I don't see how he has any trade value.  Especially to selling teams.

I'd like to see him off the roster in the most productive way possible."
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,rustyarrowhead,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:38:17 2015 UTC,Why would you want him off the roster?  He has been good this year.  Assuming Saunders comes back I'd want a platoon with him and soak at 1B
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,cookiemountain18,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:16:22 2015 UTC,his production isn't likely sustainable (though we could be pleasantly surprised) and his defence is atrocious. we've got a better version of him for the DH/1B role in Smoak and should be more worried about a suitable balance between defence and offence in LF.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,rustyarrowhead,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:22:13 2015 UTC,It's not that I don't believe you or anyone who doubts his production.  And if I were a betting mad I'd go with he is the 2015 Juan fransisco.    But he really hasn't shown any signs of slowing down.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,cookiemountain18,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:42:49 2015 UTC,this is true. his K/BB ratio has been terrible since the beginning of the year. granted he does hit lots of balls very hard but that's just a lot of luck in there.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,rustyarrowhead,2,Sun Jul 19 21:33:44 2015 UTC,This all assumes that Saunders actually manages to play another game without getting injured again.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,GracefulShutdown,5,Sun Jul 19 22:16:20 2015 UTC,88 MPH.    Last batter.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,ArminscopyofSwank,5,Sun Jul 19 22:19:25 2015 UTC,"Estrada tired, get him out before this game slips on one hit please."
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,Ruckol1,4,Sun Jul 19 19:13:25 2015 UTC,"Estrada gave us his all, great performance. But I think this should be his last batter."

Torontobluejays,3du3sz,frozzted,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:11:13 2015 UTC,We are closer to last than to first.    This division is still up for grabs though.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,ArminscopyofSwank,4,Sun Jul 19 19:09:16 2015 UTC,Hopefully not after today.

Torontobluejays,3du3sz,go_sens,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:02:07 2015 UTC,Carrera blows.    Average fielder and a single hitter.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,ArminscopyofSwank,6,Sun Jul 19 19:00:48 2015 UTC,Estrada is ridiculous. He may just win in us this incredibly important series.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,HW_Plainview,2,Sun Jul 19 19:00:19 2015 UTC,Thought: we should trade EE to the rays for some sort of pitching.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,halivera,5,Sun Jul 19 18:58:08 2015 UTC,I'm not opposed to EE being traded.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,allirow,2,Sun Jul 19 18:58:02 2015 UTC,EE is untradeable. 10-5 rule.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,ilikehockey2,2,Sun Jul 19 18:45:48 2015 UTC,EE is not untradeable.  If he were traded to the Nationals for pitching I wouldn't necessarily see him refuse it.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,allirow,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:52:54 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I suppose there are a couple instances where he wouldn't refuse but I'm sure it's unlikely."
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,ilikehockey2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:48:14 2015 UTC,Can you reference why you think its unlikely that he would agree to a trade?
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,halivera,4,Sun Jul 19 18:50:07 2015 UTC,If Toronto is going all-in I wouldn't think he'd leave. He likes Toronto.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,ilikehockey2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:51:34 2015 UTC,The thing with EE is a rebuilding team or a fringe team would have no need for a slugger with 1 year of team control left.  Only a team that's in 1st or contending would really need him.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,allirow,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:55:58 2015 UTC,or a team like the rays struggling offensively but still in the hunt?
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,halivera,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:57:32 2015 UTC,"Intra-division like that would be unlikely, you don't want to strengthen your direct competition.  The Jays also don't need to trade Edwin."
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,allirow,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:52:20 2015 UTC,AA said he might have to get creative. I just think he could be a good trade chip and the two teams have opposing weaknesses.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,halivera,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:55:08 2015 UTC,Edwin would not put Tampa over.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,allirow,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:56:40 2015 UTC,Frankly i'm not sure any trade deadline acquisition puts any team over.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,halivera,2,Sun Jul 19 19:00:37 2015 UTC,There is no way he accepts a trade to Tampa.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,Qwyjibo_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:05:16 2015 UTC,why not?
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,halivera,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:07:46 2015 UTC,"Tampa doesn't need 1 bat, they need like 5."
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,allirow,3,Sun Jul 19 18:56:33 2015 UTC,No one wants to play for the Rays. No offence to them.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,ilikehockey2,0,Sun Jul 19 18:57:47 2015 UTC,"4 great pitchers in a row, then JA Happ."
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,GracefulShutdown,2,Sun Jul 19 19:00:25 2015 UTC,"We're facing Happ in Seattle, chances are he'll be good."
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,allirow,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:58:37 2015 UTC,The Jays should be able to handle Kazmir as well.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,Qwyjibo_,2,Sun Jul 19 18:43:23 2015 UTC,and Graveman.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,rustyarrowhead,3,Sun Jul 19 18:50:40 2015 UTC,we better

Torontobluejays,3du3sz,Shablabar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:58:10 2015 UTC,"He gave up 66 HR's in the last 3 seasons with Milwaukee. So, it wasn't unfounded."

Torontobluejays,3du3sz,GracefulShutdown,2,Sun Jul 19 18:58:37 2015 UTC,Great point on Estrada's rest periods actually By buck
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,Ruckol1,5,Sun Jul 19 18:56:33 2015 UTC,What a game by Estrada so far: I think he might go another two innings
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,GracefulShutdown,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:44:41 2015 UTC,"If he stays this good, I would give him the ninth too. Anytime we can avoid use of the bullpen when a starter is on we should."
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,halivera,0,Sun Jul 19 18:39:35 2015 UTC,"No, starters who are ""on"" aren't predictive. They're just as likely to meltdown going forward as they normally are."
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,ExplainsSocialEnigma,2,Sun Jul 19 18:38:57 2015 UTC,A fresh bullpen in Oakland would be very nice.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,cheeselover42,2,Sun Jul 19 18:41:26 2015 UTC,Oh man I'd love to get me a David Price.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,ilikehockey2,2,Sun Jul 19 19:29:47 2015 UTC,David Price being on the market (if he is) would be right in a Jays uni.
Torontobluejays,3du3sz,GracefulShutdown,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:39:35 2015 UTC,Hey Buck and Pat. Has Marco almost thrown two not hitters twice in a row?

Torontobluejays,3ds980,bulloch282,4,Sat Jul 18 23:32:57 2015 UTC,"I think you're thinking of the 6 spot. According to some sabermetric analysts the 6 spot has one of the biggest advantages in using a fast runner since he can be driven in by 7, 8 and 9 hitters who don't have as much power as the top of the line-up.  He will see a significantly less PAs at 5 but I also think someone at the one spot needs a high OPS/ wOBA."
Torontobluejays,3ds980,ColdStoryBro,3,Sun Jul 19 00:40:40 2015 UTC,"With Reyes in the 1 spot, he has serious power following him in the next 3 batters. Does this reduce the value he can deliver with base stealing   Yes, absolutely. It's one of the first observations made in The Book. Not only does it make outs more dangerous, it also makes the extra bases less valuable (there's less benefit to taking 2nd when the hitters behind you are likely to walk or get XBHs).   What if he's batting say 5th, and gets himself on base with the pillars, martins and collabellos behind him where he can gamble more on the bases and boost the value of their [non-extra] base hits?   That would be an improvement except that Martin and Colabello are better hitters than Reyes so they should still hit ahead of him. Reyes is only a slighty-above league-average hitter for his career, was only league-average last year, is only projected to be league-average going for the rest of the year, and is still hitting below-average so far this year. He's the 9th-best hitter on the team so far this year and is only projected to be the 7th-best hitter going forward. Thus, depending on the day's lineup, he should likely hit 5th-7th.  And as /u/ColdStoryBro correctly pointed out, the most benefit from stealing bases typically arises in the 6-spot so that is likely to be a good spot for him. That said, that's in a typical lineup where there isn't much XBH power available in the 6-spot. In this lineup, the top-six might all have projected ISOs >170 so it might make sense to bump Reyes down to 7 for an ideal baserunning situation."
Torontobluejays,3ds980,ExplainsSocialEnigma,4,Sun Jul 19 19:11:11 2015 UTC,"Too bad our manager doesn't know how to spell OBP, let alone know what it means, so I'm pretty sure our .310-ish OBP lead off hitter is in the 1 spot to stay.  You'd think AA, who is more of a sabermetrics guy, would say something."
Torontobluejays,3ds980,cozeners,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:07:27 2015 UTC,"I mean there is some truth to the notion that Reyes is underperforming and should likely regress to a higher level. The big problem is that regression means slightly above-average OBP, and slightly below-average SLG. And that reasonably-optimistic scenario is simply not good enough for leadoff on this team. It might cut it on the 2011 Mets when Reyes was having a career year; it might cut it on the 2015 Mets when they don't have any better options; but it does not cut it on the 2015 Blue Jays when there are easily 6 superior internal options."
Torontobluejays,3ds980,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:06:00 2015 UTC,"I wonder how much of that is Gibbons set-in-his-olden-age-ways style of management vs how much of it his him managing egos. We all know players should just grow up and do what's necessary to help the team but reality is a lot of them think they're bigger than the team and their effort level diminishes quickly if they don't get things the way they want all the time.  I'm not saying this is the case with Reyes, I've never even met the guy. I just remember Cito Gaston once saying those teams left him with very little actual coaching to do (referring to the 92/93 teams) and his biggest challenge was managing all the big personalities in the club house to keep everybody focused and motivated."

Torontobluejays,3drkva,Intoxicatedcanadian,9,Sat Jul 18 21:50:43 2015 UTC,He has been shitty overall this year though.

Torontobluejays,3drkva,Qwyjibo_,12,Sat Jul 18 22:02:25 2015 UTC,A few? In his last 9 starts hes allowed 21 earned runs (22 total). That works out to just over 2 runs per game. The Jays are 3-6 in those games.

Torontobluejays,3drkva,Bringer_Of_Rain20,6,Sun Jul 19 01:09:33 2015 UTC,"As usual, armchair viewers think they know everything. You realize that pitchers need to pitch? You know, in order to maintain control, feel, not get injured, etc. You also realize there was a long break, you know, due to the all-star game.    Let me ask you, what if today was another blow out win? Tomorrow? When do you pitch your pitchers? You can't predict the future and neither can Gibby. Of course, you rant about him because he's not a future prophet. Neither you nor Gibby knows what the future holds. He needs to give his pitchers innings. Baseball 101.    You've never seen a Blue Jays bullpen so horribly mismanaged must mean this is the first year you started watching the Blue Jays. Gibbons is far from the worst, but of course, don't let that stop you with the negativity.    It's quite ridiculous. You sit here with the bonus of having watched today's and yesterday's game and think you know everything because based on the outcomes you would have done different. It's like you never heard of the saying hindsight is 20-20.    When the Blue Jays win, it's never Gibbons. When the Blue Jays lose it's only Gibbons. You should be ashamed."
Torontobluejays,3drkva,alamarco,0,Sun Jul 19 00:07:30 2015 UTC,"Loup was available yesterday up 6-2. He had a long rest. Why was he not in the game? Clearly, if it was a blowout today, then he can use  Osuna or Bo. But that would mean the series would be 2-0 Jays. That's a totally different story. If TB is blowing it out, then he can use maybe one of the more reliable pitchers. Rest doesn't hurt anyone.  I don't claim that the bullpen should be perfect. But the moves need to make sense. If Osuna or Bo or even Delabar comes in and blows a save, then at least we know we used one of the better arms available. It's not rocket science. Of course, we're taking about a manager who can barely string together 2 coherent sentences, so I guess to him it is rocket science."

Torontobluejays,3drkva,rustyarrowhead,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:10:04 2015 UTC,That's not a personal attack. John Gibbons is not known for his communication skills. That alone tells me all I need to know about his ability to analyze a situation and deal with it in the best way possible.  The fact that it offends you that I insult his intelligence only bolsters my view that there are people on this subreddit that either work for Rogers or are related to John Gibbons.
Torontobluejays,3drkva,cozeners,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:18:51 2015 UTC,I swear that your use of the work for Rogers/related to John Gibbon's schtick is equivalent to Godwin's Law in this subreddit. that's a patently ridiculous assertion.

Torontobluejays,3drkva,cozeners,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:03:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not personally offended at all. I think you're on a typical arm-chair campaign to have the manager fired with minimal and often ridiculous evidence. every manager faces tough decision with the bullpen and Gibbons has been hindered by one that's lacking dependable arms. yet when he uses them, you immediately point to it the next day as mismanagement because they aren't available. the reality is the pitchers have not performed in situations that they've been reliable in based on past record. what else would you expect Gibbons to do?"
Torontobluejays,3drkva,rustyarrowhead,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:12:36 2015 UTC,"Like I said repeatedly: you don't use a guy with a 5.00 ERA, and a 7.45 ERA in his last 15 games, with a one run lead. That is not even a debatable point.  Osuna gave up a game winning HR a few weeks back, IIRC. I didn't say a word. He was the right choice. Sometimes the right choice doesn't work. That's fine, it happens.  But using Loup and Tepera in that game, after he wasted Osuna and Bo? That's inexcusable. There is no debate on that point. It was the epitome of BP mismanagement. And because of that, instead if a sweep, it's only 2/3."
Torontobluejays,3drkva,cozeners,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:38:41 2015 UTC,What exactly do pro-Gibbons supporters point to? He doesn't have a fucking clue what he's doing
Torontobluejays,3drkva,ilikehockey2,5,Sat Jul 18 23:26:05 2015 UTC,"Basically they say Gibbons doesn't throw the pitches, so it's all on the bullpen. They'll say that knowing full well that Osuna and Bo were wasted yesterday. But that means nothing, apparently,  Unfortunately, the 11 game win streak saved Gibbons' ass. He should have been fired before that streak began. Even during the streak, his bullpen management was atrocious, but nobody noticed because, well, 11-0.  Very sad that the best years of Jose Bautista's and EE's careers have been wasted on this tool of a manager. Has always been a loser and always will be.  On the bright side? This will be his last season. Guaranteed."
Torontobluejays,3drkva,cozeners,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:32:35 2015 UTC,"Does it even matter? Most managers at best make a marginal difference. Gibbon is no exception.  Bullpen management cannot be evaluated based on result, since much of the decision ends up being a flip of a coin. I can't say for much of May, Gibby had much of a luxury in terms of bullpen arms nor did he have much of an option when it comes to outfielders.  If you think you know better, you're more than welcome to send your resume over to the Blue Jays front office. Maybe it might not make a difference, or it might make the team much, much worse."
Torontobluejays,3drkva,BasedPython,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:19:59 2015 UTC,To be fair no lead is big enough when Osuna isn't pitching.
Torontobluejays,3drkva,mcmadbat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:21:55 2015 UTC,"Well, the 6-2 lead was held up yesterday for 2 innings even before Osuna entered. They can hold leads if you give them proper roles. Who puts their blasted closer in a 6-2 game??? And then use a guy with a 5.00-ish ERA in a 2-1 game late?  Loup's ERA in his last 15 appearances is 7.45. 7.45 for crying out loud!! What the hell is this manager doing?"
Torontobluejays,3drkva,cozeners,2,Sat Jul 18 23:39:24 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't understand how you can blame a manager for ""mismanaging his bullpen"" when he only has 2 reliable arms in there. If he had brought in Schultz yesterday and he gave up the lead, you would be calling for his head.   A 4 run lead is not safe in this bullpen, so you cannot fault him for using his best relievers"
Torontobluejays,3drkva,Bringer_Of_Rain20,2,Sun Jul 19 03:26:05 2015 UTC,"No, I would not call for his head if Shultz had blown the lead. Shultz has an ERA around 2.00. Shultz has earned the right to be put into high leverage situations. I don't complain when smart moves don't work out. I complain when stupid moves don't work out.  Aaron Loup has a 7.45 ERA over his past 15 appearances and a 5.00+ ERA over his last 30. He should be in AAA, not trying to hold one-run leads in the AL East.  Like I said, it's not rocket science."
Torontobluejays,3drkva,cozeners,2,Sun Jul 19 10:50:20 2015 UTC,"He has TWO reliable arms in a 7 man bullpen. It's not the managers fault that he can't use them every day.

Torontobluejays,3drkva,baconreader123456,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:26:07 2015 UTC,AA basically being a lame duck GM makes it tough for the Jays to go 100% either way in terms of buying or selling.

Whoever the new Beeston will be, they will bring in their own guy unless the Jays have a good run in the playoffs this year (which I'm not betting any money on).   AA has been fine at building up the farm system but has clearly repeatedly failed in putting together a pitching staff at the MLB level. I wouldn't mind if he stayed on with the Jays but it most likely won't happen. I'm sure he'll find another job in baseball."
Torontobluejays,3dqu45,penultimate_evil,4,Sat Jul 18 15:55:36 2015 UTC,The point of the title? All franchises miss out on signing drafties as players hope to sign higher in following years and hence get a bigger signing bonus. 5 picks in 7 years is not cause for concern as you seem to be insinuating.
Torontobluejays,3dqu45,laketrout,5,Sat Jul 18 21:22:49 2015 UTC,"Only six players in the top-10 rounds failed to sign this year (98.1%), 98.1% in 2014 and 97.5% in 2013 (link - http://www.minorleagueball.com/2015/7/17/8996381/unsigned-mlb-draft-picks-first-20-rounds-2015).  It's possible that the Jays are aggressively drafting players with signability concerns, but missing out on development time with top draft picks does not seem to be an insignificant issue to me."
Torontobluejays,3dqu45,laketrout,2,Sat Jul 18 21:58:07 2015 UTC,"You're right, I think that's their strategy - if it's a pick they'll recoup next year if the player fails to sign, then they'll risk it on a good player who fell down the list because they've indicated they might not sign."
Torontobluejays,3dqu45,kapacj,2,Sat Jul 18 22:22:36 2015 UTC,"They can get the puck back next year, and the risk has paid off many times. Guys like SR-F, and and Alford for risky picks that have added high ceiling guys to our system from outside of the first round."

Torontobluejays,3dqu45,gandalfsnutsack,2,Sat Jul 18 17:08:46 2015 UTC,"I have been a critic of AA on this sub but I will say this: I like what he's doing. Yeah, some of these picks won't sign but it's the strategy that I like. Go aggressively after high upside guys who may have signability issues. We'll lose some but that's okay.   Overall you just need a couple to pan out and you're set. Reid Foley is a good example of this."

Because you can't double dip with a replacement pick, being ""safer"" often means selecting a player with warts who is more apt to sign a contract at or below slot.  I'm not sure that's a sound long-term player development plan."

It'll take another 3-5 years to have a good answer to that one.  I won't dispute that a player like Stroman has turned out great, but at the same time, he's a 5'8"" starting pitcher.

Some guys have a good week and then implode for three. Other times our starter gets blown up for four starts before settling down and channeling his inner Johnny Cueto.  Honestly, where do you start?"
Torontobluejays,3dqjvn,Funkagenda,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:46:47 2015 UTC,"This year? I would almost argue that you can't. This year will end in a bust. There's too much to fix with too little assets you can give up to do it. At best, you fix a bullpen spot and maybe a starter or two. That still doesn't solve everything.  Its better to look to next year at this point.  Stroman, Buerhle (if he stays) and Sanchez are nice foundation. Go out and sign at least one of the big name pitchers out of Free Agency. And you can have four guys with good stuff. If Norris gets his stuff back, your rotation of 5 is set. And you can look into moving pieces for extra arms in the pen or sign an extra RP in FA or two."

Jays don't have enough assets to give up to get anything substantial in return to address all the needs they have. The starters are chaotic and sporadic. The bullpen is the biggest joke ever. I'd even argue the ""best offense in baseball"" is the most ""inconsistent offense in baseball"".  How in fucking God's name do you fix ALL OF THAT with less than 3 months to go in a season?"

Torontobluejays,3dqjvn,Funkagenda,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:59:50 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the Jays are run by people with an interest in winning but no motivation to try and win.  Rogers makes a shit ton of money off selling ""hope"" every season for this team. They don't pay more than 5 year contracts so you're never going to see any substantial and huge players coming this way unless they're at the tail end of an already established contract.  Rogers & the Jays are perfectly fine being mediocre year in and year out because they know the fans are kind of dumb enough to keep coming back for more because a new face or two is added to the team each year that makes people believe ""omg this is going to be awesome!"" Except all that's being sold to people is overrated hype."

Torontobluejays,3dok8a,evilzamboni,4,Sat Jul 18 12:37:35 2015 UTC,THIS ONE'S GOT A CHANCE!
Torontobluejays,3dok8a,drmarcj,3,Sat Jul 18 14:45:39 2015 UTC,"I know I've said this before, but I have a new appreciation for Buck and Pat after having to listen to Paul Romanuk and Glenn Healy call Leaf games during the winter."
Torontobluejays,3dok8a,stevefrench2112,9,Sat Jul 18 14:20:19 2015 UTC,"Do you just not notice the countless times Buck starts his home run call only to watch it die about 15 feet in front of the warning track? They mail the no doubters, sure, but everyone gets those right away. But they are no better than any other announcers at knowing a ball is going for a home run."
Torontobluejays,3dok8a,cbarone1,10,Sat Jul 18 00:20:25 2015 UTC,IT'S BACK BACK WAAAAY BACK ANNNND...pop out to the shortstop.
Torontobluejays,3dok8a,ScruffsMcGuff,10,Sat Jul 18 09:34:29 2015 UTC,I'd argue they're one of the better pairings for sure. Don't notice that happening very often with long flys...  Do you notice how good they are with foul balls both down the lines and behind home plate relative to other announcers?
Torontobluejays,3dok8a,cbarone1,-8,Sat Jul 18 00:50:36 2015 UTC,"It just happened with Josh Donaldson.   I can't notice something that doesnt exist. Maybe you just really want then to be better than everyone else, so you notice the ones they get right, but they get just as many wrong. There have plenty of times where Buck will say someone is going to try and make a play on a foul ball only to watch it land 10 rows deep. They're really no better than any other announcers with balls behind the plate, down the line, over the wall, or anything else. They're very average at calling a game, with the added bonus of Buck not knowing people's names, or over pronouncing their names."
Torontobluejays,3dok8a,halivera,10,Sat Jul 18 01:35:19 2015 UTC,"That Donaldson ball was 6 inches from being a homer, and would've been a double if not for  great play, no announcer would've been able to get that call right. I think Buck and Pat do a very good job, especially with foul balls."
Torontobluejays,3dok8a,cbarone1,-7,Sat Jul 18 01:39:25 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between calling it as a well hit ball that could be a home run, and calling it as a home run. Buck has his home run voice and call that he uses on the balls he thinks are going out. He very often uses them on balls that are not going out, close or otherwise. He jumps the gun a lot."
Torontobluejays,3dok8a,halivera,8,Sat Jul 18 01:45:40 2015 UTC,"I think thats a little nitpicky. Buck is a very good announcer as long as you don't have ridiculous expectations, and is probably better than many other announcers across the league."
Torontobluejays,3dok8a,Bridgemaster11,4,Sat Jul 18 02:03:26 2015 UTC,I don't care for Buck personally. I've always felt that way and I don't have objective proof and I don't expect that if I provided examples I could sway your opinion. It's a personal thing.   He's a dink though and if you feel otherwise I'll battle you.
Torontobluejays,3dok8a,cbarone1,-6,Sat Jul 18 04:10:56 2015 UTC,"Obviously, I disagree, but to each their own. Either way, if it means we win, I'll happily listen to him calling home runs that are caught well short of the wall"
Torontobluejays,3dok8a,LeeUmm,2,Sat Jul 18 02:09:50 2015 UTC,"Don't forget when Buck starts to call his home run line, only to see the ball go foul by a wide margin."
Torontobluejays,3dok8a,cbarone1,0,Sat Jul 18 01:23:36 2015 UTC,"I especially enjoy ""it's a home run if it's fair"" while the ump is already putting a new ball in play because it was clearly foul off the bat."

Torontobluejays,3doyeh,paulcrose,12,Sat Jul 18 01:44:42 2015 UTC,I feel like they need to focus on getting more runs than the other team.

Torontobluejays,3doyeh,paulcrose,8,Sat Jul 18 03:20:21 2015 UTC,"These are, in fact, the best ones."
Torontobluejays,3doyeh,ImArcherVaderAMA,15,Sat Jul 18 01:51:42 2015 UTC,"That was a fucking game.  Great offense, solid defense, good pitching.  This is what they need to do in the second half."
Torontobluejays,3doyeh,allirow,6,Sat Jul 18 01:44:39 2015 UTC,"Been busy tonight and had the game on in the background.  But the few extended moments I had, Hutch still looked pretty uneven.  Was it just those instances I saw (ie. I saw Martin called for the fastball low and outside, and as soon as it left his hands, I knew he missed badly.  Boom. Homer?  Schulz...now this guy is looking fantastic in middle relief."
Torontobluejays,3doyeh,ImArcherVaderAMA,10,Sat Jul 18 01:54:59 2015 UTC,Middle relief?  Bo should be solidified as the setup man behind Osuna.
Torontobluejays,3doyeh,ModernPoultry,3,Sat Jul 18 02:41:08 2015 UTC,"That'd be good, but for now...I think we just need him to be able to come in whenever we need him.  5th inning, 7th, 2nd, whatever.  No defined role.  Just keep getting batters out."
Torontobluejays,3doyeh,ImArcherVaderAMA,5,Sat Jul 18 02:48:23 2015 UTC,tbh the designated 'roles' in baseball are stupid. Kind of a tangent but your best pitcher should be used for instance in say a tie game bases loaded in the 7th which I would argue would probably end up the most important situation in a game. Closer roles are stupid  /end rant
Torontobluejays,3doyeh,ModernPoultry,5,Sat Jul 18 02:53:56 2015 UTC,"I agree, you should use the best pitcher for the given situation.  I also hate designating pitchers as a 'number 2 or 3' guy.  You set your rotation based upon the best match ups."
Torontobluejays,3doyeh,allirow,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:11:31 2015 UTC,"How could anyone manoeuvre the rotation for that? They pitch once every 5 days. If you change things, then you'll mess with the rest days and probably cause injury or fatigue. Unless you have something else in mind...?"
Torontobluejays,3doyeh,cozeners,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:12:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about full blown reshuffling, but giving an arm an extra day by using an off day to your advantage, and moving another arm forward to create a favorable matchup."
Torontobluejays,3doyeh,allirow,0,Sat Jul 18 12:04:57 2015 UTC,"Ok so let's say Hutch is dealing and it's a 4-0 game, 7th inning, nobody out. Are you saying you're going to warm up Osuna to begin the inning, just in case the bases get loaded? If you wait until they're loaded to warm him up, he's not going to be ready. So how on earth do you get your best reliever into that situation? If you start warming him up, and it's a 3 up 3 down inning, now he's warm for nothing. And then someone hits a solo shot in the 8th and you now need him warming again for the 9th.  Yes, theoretically, you want your best pitcher in the most crucial situations. But it's impossible to plan. That's why having defined roles is always the best solution. Which is also why it was another bone-headed move for Osuna to even enter this game in the 9th. Now he's probably limited to only one more appearance in this important series, and he wasn't even needed in this one."
Torontobluejays,3doyeh,cozeners,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:09:24 2015 UTC,How do you get any other pitcher ready in the same situation? That's how you'd get Osuna ready.
Torontobluejays,3doyeh,cbarone1,28,Sat Jul 18 14:03:53 2015 UTC,"It's sooooo nice to have Buck Martinez back. I know he has his haters, but IMO he has the perfect voice and cadence for the game."

Torontobluejays,3doyeh,brownmagician,6,Sat Jul 18 03:13:27 2015 UTC,"Never mind the 4 TB hitters that hit line drives that were caught. Hutch was lucky in this one. He didn't pitch poorly, but it could have been much worse."
Torontobluejays,3doyeh,cozeners,2,Sat Jul 18 07:21:03 2015 UTC,"I hear what you're saying but if you look at his strikes tonight, they weren't very often hittable pitches. They may have got some good swings against him, but he was placing the ball around the plate well, regardless."

Torontobluejays,3dnrkx,OneGreatLove,4,Sat Jul 18 03:41:06 2015 UTC,The only players that go through the draft are American born players (puerto Rico as well) and Canadian born players. Everyone else is free to sign at 16. Also wanna add it's kind of fucked that canadians have to be drafted when literally every other country in the world gets to sign. We have a smaller talent pool than the DR or venezuela.

But pitching wise they give up fewer walks and homers, I'd say about 10% better than the jays. I'm sure their numbers are more dispersed over several games whereas much of our runs were on blowouts."

Torontobluejays,3dnv4t,thecanadiandude,4,Sat Jul 18 00:47:38 2015 UTC,Lets use Edwin as a trade chip for a pitcher. I really like Smoak/Colabello playing the 1/DH.  Smoak has really proven himself
Torontobluejays,3dnv4t,ModernPoultry,2,Sat Jul 18 00:45:38 2015 UTC,5/10 and Edwin loves Toronto
Torontobluejays,3dnv4t,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:10:16 2015 UTC,I've been talking about the same thing for the last 2 months. I feel Smoak is the best 1st basemen defensively the Jays have had for awhile. His reach alone saves a lot of errors. And Colabello also as a 1st base option makes sense offensively. Edwin definitely sweetens the deal for a good pitcher I feel if packaged with prospect.
Torontobluejays,3dnv4t,l_VegaBond_l,-1,Sat Jul 18 01:04:58 2015 UTC,"Unless you get blown away for an offer, you don't trade Edwin.    Half of MLB seems to be on a no-trade list to Toronto.    Who wants to pitch/hit against the NYY or Sox every year?    Also taxes.  Yeah, the taxes.  I mentioned the taxes.    No pitbulls either.    Trading Edwin is a terrible mistake."
Torontobluejays,3dnv4t,ArminscopyofSwank,2,Sat Jul 18 01:01:55 2015 UTC,"The taxes are a huge misconception. Toronto ranks middle of the pack in total rates compared to other mlb cities where city/state taxes are higher. Also playing in Toronto is a bonus because they get paid in USD. So with the conversion rate, 20 million turns into 25.9 million"
Torontobluejays,3dnv4t,ModernPoultry,0,Sat Jul 18 01:07:12 2015 UTC,Smoak has a career 225 batting average. He hasn't proven anything except that he hit a HR and a double today.
Torontobluejays,3dnv4t,belardi,2,Sat Jul 18 00:57:46 2015 UTC,Smoak has been consistently hitting well in his starts.  Maybe over a longer period of time it will slow down but he's hit well enough to justify giving him a chance to prove himself full time.

Torontobluejays,3dnv4t,belardi,2,Sat Jul 18 01:50:18 2015 UTC,Hes been great for us. Maybe hes turned it around? He was a 1st round pick
Torontobluejays,3dnv4t,ModernPoultry,2,Sat Jul 18 01:02:13 2015 UTC,Edwin is so close to getting it together. He literally carries the team when he starts hitting homeruns consistently. Do you really want to miss that?
Torontobluejays,3dnv4t,baconreader123456,0,Sat Jul 18 00:47:46 2015 UTC,Offense isnt exactly the problem with this team...
Torontobluejays,3dnv4t,ModernPoultry,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:50:18 2015 UTC,"it's not the problem but it is the basic construction of it. that's why I am so opposed to trading from the major league roster, especially the core. not only is Edwin cheap for the production he provides but he provides nominal protection (and a lot of the time real protection) for Donaldson and Bautista. further, Edwin has expressed a willingness to finish his career in Toronto and even if he provides 75% of his production now, he'll still be a bargain at the same cost. I would guess that he would sign a 3-year contract with a reasonable contract and 2 years of options at a similar price.   if you want to add pitching, you ADD it. you don't subtract from core pieces to compensate."
Torontobluejays,3dnv4t,rustyarrowhead,5,Sat Jul 18 01:23:46 2015 UTC,How many close games can the Jays afford to lose while waiting for him to get it together?
Torontobluejays,3dnv4t,stillnothingon,2,Sat Jul 18 00:48:48 2015 UTC,"I mean, he's still hitting fine. He's just a league-average DH instead of the one of the best DH's in the AL."
Torontobluejays,3dnv4t,ExplainsSocialEnigma,3,Sat Jul 18 01:12:18 2015 UTC,He has veto. Won't trade to a losing team.
Torontobluejays,3dnv4t,paulcrose,2,Sat Jul 18 00:46:59 2015 UTC,A losing team wouldn't want Edwin.  A contending team that's short on offense with excess pitching to do deal would.

Torontobluejays,3dnv4t,paulcrose,2,Sat Jul 18 00:56:22 2015 UTC,Apparently he has a no trade clause so its even more unlikely

Torontobluejays,3dmb2p,darrrrrren,9,Fri Jul 17 12:48:01 2015 UTC,"See, I don't agree with the writer.  Hoffman's stuff is so naturally good, that even manipulating his mechanics for the benefits of easing him back into starting won't be enough to fully suffocate the talent.    I think the Jays are doing the right thing.  Hoffman's stuff is terrific, and will likely manifest itself over time.  But for now, easing him in with good mechanics is better than throwing him back out there.  There's a millions invested in this pitcher - they are looking to capitalise on it."
Torontobluejays,3dmb2p,acrimony87,3,Fri Jul 17 13:19:47 2015 UTC,"I think the Jays are doing the right thing. Hoffman's stuff is terrific, and will likely manifest itself over time. But for now, easing him in with good mechanics is better than throwing him back out there.   They're not easing him in with good mechanics. And it's not easing him in, this will likely be a permanent change.  See: Aaron Sanchez.  The Jays have been criticised for doing this before with other pitchers, specificially shortening their stride and falling away from the plate rather than towards it.  Here's what bluejaysbanter said about Aaron Sanchez, who uses the exact same type of windup:   As numerous scouts have noted, his delivery has gotten worse, which has resulted in wild control and possible injury concerns. The abbreviated finish has also reduced the effectiveness of his breaking ball, which has all led to a step back for the top Blue Jays prospect.   Hm, reduced effectiveness of the breaking ball, which fangraphs noticed for Hoffman.  Keith Law on Aaron Sanchez:   The Blue Jays' top prospect had an up-and-down year around minor injuries and a failed experiment with a sinker, but Toronto could at least look at his premium stuff and feel confident that he was advancing toward a spot near the top of their major league rotation. Unfortunately, Sanchez's delivery has gone backward in the past year, with a shorter-than-ever stride and a very upright release that causes his fastball to stay up and hurts his command of all pitches.  An upright torso at release is also correlated with higher risk of arm injuries, so it's something the Jays and Sanchez need to try to correct. Sanchez's stuff remains ace quality -- 92-96 mph on the four-seamer, a plus curveball at 76-79, a hard changeup from 85-89 -- but he has to let his athleticism and looseness on the mound show up in the delivery.   Fangraphs described Hoffman as being upright and stiff, so who even knows if it's better for reducing injury."
Torontobluejays,3dmb2p,Snidernomore,4,Fri Jul 17 15:41:28 2015 UTC,"Your title is misrepresenting the article. The article mentions that Hoffman is not throwing his curveball with the same aggression as pre-injury. It then goes on to speculate as to why this is the case, and if this is permanent switch. Furthermore the article says this will help his development and shorten his path to the majors, just not enough to offset the loss of upside."
Torontobluejays,3dmb2p,Vordermark,4,Fri Jul 17 12:56:31 2015 UTC,It's not a misrepresentation. They explicitly say it will hurt his upside and suggest it will harm his overall development as it doesn't provide sufficient countervailing benefits
Torontobluejays,3dmb2p,ExplainsSocialEnigma,6,Fri Jul 17 13:20:18 2015 UTC,"They worry about the changes they're making being permanent.  They speculate that it's temporary, being a power pitcher coming off TJ.  If it's a permanent change though, they likened it to changing the likes of an Adam Wainwright type pitcher into just a solid starter."
Torontobluejays,3dmb2p,allirow,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:51:38 2015 UTC,"The jays have a history of doing this where they ask a player to perform and master a single task for an entire season, then take the training wheels off later in their development.  Case in point the way they approached DJ Davis' plate approach.   In Hoffman's case I think they are just being cautious following TJ and teaching him the CH at the same time."
Torontobluejays,3dm80u,nocturnal_goatsucker,7,Fri Jul 17 12:13:07 2015 UTC,I really hope that the Jays don't sell out their future to try and make the playoffs but flop again. Rather develop young players
Torontobluejays,3dm80u,Mapleleaf97,6,Fri Jul 17 17:00:58 2015 UTC,"I agree.  For the first time in a long time I'm really happy about the team in upcoming seasons. Think about Norris, Sanchez, Hutch, Stroman all developing with each other, we could have such a dominant rotation in the coming years.  I really don't want to clear out our up and comers because I don't think the Jays are THAT bad this year and have shown they have the ability to win some games and I still think, given the AL East, they have a great chance to get to the playoffs this year.    I don't think it's worth giving up our star studded would be rotation for a chance while we already have a chance."
Torontobluejays,3dm80u,MakVolci,2,Fri Jul 17 17:26:47 2015 UTC,"I think I've settled into a similar position. Would I like us to make the playoffs this year? Duh, of course. Would I like us to make moves to help make that happen? Of course. Do I want to throw away upcoming years for the chance to make it this year? Nah. I'd be fine not making it this year if it means we keep our strong up and comers so that we have a chance to have a stretch of good seasons. I prefer the chance of having a continuously competitive team than going all in on this one year, because whether we win or not we will be bitter in two years about the team going to shit if we sell the farm."
Torontobluejays,3dm80u,thebrokendoctor,3,Fri Jul 17 21:51:33 2015 UTC,"As much as I would like the Jays to make the playoffs, I agree, I don't want it to be just one year and then back to medicore/shitting the bed. I want to see a trade that can let this team be in contention for a few of years."

Torontobluejays,3dm80u,Royal_Flush13,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:16:52 2015 UTC,Drafting and free agency is better than handing out our future
Torontobluejays,3dm80u,Mapleleaf97,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:29:04 2015 UTC,"Drafting and free agency is better than handing out our future   That's an extreme view to take, especially when it isn't necessarily ""handing out our future"". A bullish person would call it ""upgrading our current roster, which has the best offense in baseball that won't be there anymore by the time the young pitchers develop. Oh, and there are no/few good bats in the minors to get promoted with them"".  The Jays have a surplus of young, talented pitching prospects. They have a shortage of major-league calibre pitchers, whose addition would have a disproportionate effect on the team's record given their exceptional offense. Econ 101 would dictate...  Besides, if the team is so good at drafting and free agency, then they'll be able to stock the farm again in no time with more first-round picks that you've never seen play and only know from scouting reports and reddit comments. And the cycle will continue."
Torontobluejays,3dm80u,Royal_Flush13,2,Fri Jul 17 19:35:12 2015 UTC,Just wait for them to trade Sanchez for another bat.
Torontobluejays,3dm80u,God_Emperor_Dune,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:20:23 2015 UTC,"If we need to move a pitching prospect Sanchez is the one I would want to move. I dislike his delivery and don't think his breaking stuff plays as a starter because he cannot, and hasn't been able to since the Jays altered his delivery two years ago, throw it for strikes.  Norris, Labourt, Castro, Osuna, Hoffman, SRF would be unmoveable at this point for me."
Torontobluejays,3dm80u,Ferivich,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:33:57 2015 UTC,I'd move any prospect(s) (excluding Stroman).    If you're not going to make a move the year you have the best offence (by far) in baseball in such a competitive division then I don't know when...
Torontobluejays,3dla47,RicoPapaya,6,Fri Jul 17 04:42:30 2015 UTC,The next 9 games are critical for this team. The jays will have to run the table leading up to the trade deadline to force Alex's hand in making a move.  They are a game below 500 so there is no way AA should give up the future for a rental.  If we go 7-2 going into the trade deadline I can see him trying hard to make a deal for an arm with control.  Alex is in a very tight spot right now.
Torontobluejays,3dk3lq,Tyoung1110,15,Thu Jul 16 22:26:09 2015 UTC,Morosi doesn't really know what AA is doing. Remember that no body knew about the Donaldson before it happened. That's how AA works.
Torontobluejays,3dk3lq,ichiibanaba,3,Fri Jul 17 01:42:07 2015 UTC,"Everything these reporters say needs to be taken with a grain of salt as well. It's not like some FO guy sneaks out of a meeting to text a reporter. These guys have relationships with teams and it's a two-way street.  It's like you said, teams are more than capable of conducting trade talks quietly, they give reporters whatever information they feel might give them more leverage."

Not a single team in the league is more mediocre than them. Year in and year out, teams in the AL East rise and fall, but the Jays plod steadily on, no playoffs in TWENTY TWO years. Tampa was the shittiest team in baseball for over a decade, yet they won the division. Baltimore sucked for a while, then they won it.

Torontobluejays,3disfv,Born_Ruff,0,Thu Jul 16 21:11:31 2015 UTC,We already have five guys on the roster that we can play in outfield. Two that can handle center. Pompey would have to make some strides before we would seriously consider bringing him up even in the case of injury.

Torontobluejays,3di98h,mrmonopoly25,22,Thu Jul 16 15:28:27 2015 UTC,I can't think of a player on any of our teams in the past 10 years that's repped TO as hard as Stro
Torontobluejays,3di98h,treilly19,24,Thu Jul 16 16:21:27 2015 UTC,"I mean, he and Sanchez changed their jersey numbers to be ""416""    That alone would have made me love him inappropriately, if I already didn't!"
Torontobluejays,3di98h,ImArcherVaderAMA,12,Thu Jul 16 16:50:54 2015 UTC,"I know right, that's the most toronto thing anyone has ever done"
Torontobluejays,3di98h,treilly19,2,Thu Jul 16 17:10:44 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Stroman changed his number to 6 to honour his late grandmother
Torontobluejays,3di98h,boomhauer86,5,Thu Jul 16 20:32:00 2015 UTC,"I think it was for both. He refers to TO as the 6 all the time in his tweets and it's not coincidence that his best friend on the team and him combine to make 416  His initial reason was for his grandmother, but he hasn't shied away from the other meaning of he number."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,Levesque77,2,Thu Jul 16 23:55:24 2015 UTC,"John Buck comes to mind.  Toronto gave him a full time job, and then let him leave to free agency free from arbitration so he could pursue a full time playing opportunity.  Then when he came back as part of the Miami trade, he immediately called up all the other players to let them know how good of a city Toronto is and how well the treat their players.  ....then he was traded to the Mets as part of the Dickey deal."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,allirow,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:39:24 2015 UTC,"C'mon now that's just not true, there are plenty of players across all of our sports teams that represent Toronto very well. Don't you remember the whole Team Unit thing a few years back? Lawrie, Romero and JP may have been lightning rods but they damn well played for TO with pride. Not to mention the countless Raptors and Leafs who do the same."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,dgapa,5,Thu Jul 16 17:38:52 2015 UTC,"Really, I didn't get that feel from JP or Romero. Maybe Lawrie, but he's always high strung. But following Stroman on social media, really shows how much love he's got for the city and team, unless he's just playing it up, which he's doing very well if so."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,mrmonopoly25,6,Thu Jul 16 18:19:09 2015 UTC,"It's easy to say that know, but back then it was very different. Stroman may be the most effective and ""likeable"" person on the team, but it shouldn't diminish the fact that multiple players on multiple teams give it there all as far as promotions and representation. I hate JP as much as the next guy, but he truly seemed to love the city, even as people were turning on him."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,dgapa,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:22:05 2015 UTC,"I've never really thought great things of JP ever, he just had flashes of talent that I would hope to pan out, but I never really saw a full season where I felt he was going to break out. I honestly wished we got rid of him sooner than letting him play himself out. Alas, Toronto is a team of giving lots of chances to their players IMO. I know the guy was good working with the Jays community, but even when he was in his last couple seasons, I wouldn't say he was giving his all. After reading a few articles about how he thought he was suppose to play for the Jays and not really changing his approach even after the numerous amounts of comments on his shit play, the guy seemed more into himself then how his play can make the team better."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,mrmonopoly25,2,Thu Jul 16 18:29:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of that, but I feel your your confusing what I am saying. The original comment was about Stroman being the only athlete that reps Toronto hard and JP was one example I gave of a player who repped Toronto hard, albeit briefly. Mind you without JP we wouldn't have Martin so take it as you wish."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,dgapa,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:27:33 2015 UTC,"I understood what you were getting at. I was just giving my point and opinion on why I don't think JP (as we have singled him out) repped the city hard, I certainly don't think he did and I just don't mean through his play, even though I don't feel like he tried hard enough with that either. That might be because I never really cared for him, but if you think he repped hard for Toronto then to each his own. There are others besides Stroman I'll agree with that but if you want to compare JP to Stroman on repping your team, JP is at the back of the line or not even standing in it IMO."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,mrmonopoly25,2,Thu Jul 16 19:42:38 2015 UTC,"To each his own I guess. I just distinctly remember the Team Unit stuff from a few years ago and it seemed like the group of Jays and Leafs that did it were all over social media bragging about how awesome Toronto is and posting their favourite spots in the city. It's easier to say this about Stro since he's not playing he's on social media all the time.  Also JP was just one of my examples, I also used Lawrie and Romero. But outside of the Jays you have Amir Johnson, Demar Derozen and Grevies Vasquez that repped the city just as hard, if not more so than Stroman has recently."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,dgapa,2,Thu Jul 16 19:48:25 2015 UTC,"We just have difference of what repping means, the Team Unit stuff seemed much more manufactured than Stro being Stro. You could say he's more active on social media due to him not playing, but with his age and excitement I'm going to say he'll be frequent on social media. Reyes posts things frequently but mostly boring. Also I'm with you on the Raptors front, but I wasn't including them in my original thought nor the Leafs, as I was only talking about the Jays even though the other comment mentioned all TO's teams. Their defiantly hasn't been many on the Jays."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,mrmonopoly25,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:01:17 2015 UTC,"Not only that, look at the AL East. We're not the only ones who have a good shot at a playoff birth. So trading someone with team control and high upside for a rental is exceptionally risky. If we were protecting a lead in the division, i'd feel a little better about it."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,jaysrapsleafs,9,Thu Jul 16 19:25:37 2015 UTC,"I see no way that Anthopoulos trades Stroman for any of the names available. This team is largely intact for next season, so there's no sense mortgaging the future for rental players to help us make the playoffs."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,Teachmevee,10,Thu Jul 16 16:02:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think Stroman is going anywhere unless there's a serious overpay in return. Norris, Hoffman, or even Sanchez I'd be more willing to move for the right return."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,SULLYvin,8,Thu Jul 16 15:39:52 2015 UTC,The only way Stroman is dealt (in a package) is if somehow someone like Chris Sale or Sonny Gray hit the trade market.   Absolutely not to any of the usual trade targets being thrown around lately.
Torontobluejays,3di98h,Qwyjibo_,12,Thu Jul 16 16:19:51 2015 UTC,If we trade Stroman we better get Cueto and Leake and Chapman. We have plenty of other prospects to trade so it's not like Stroman is our only piece.
Torontobluejays,3di98h,mcmadbat,7,Thu Jul 16 14:58:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly the other GMs wouldn't be doing their jobs if they didn't at least ask about Stro...he's the kind of player every single team in either league would want near the front of their rotation. Even in Washington I believe a healthy Stroman is top three.  Unless somebody started the conversation about a trade with at least an all star caliber corner outfielder, a great starter and a willingness to take on a certain albatross back loaded contract, I doubt Marcus goes anywhere."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,thursday51,9,Thu Jul 16 16:28:41 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear here, Stroman is the last person I'd want to see traded.  I love him to death, and the work he's putting in that I see on Instagram is flat out incredible.  LOVE this guy and the way he loves Toronto.  BUT, let's just speak hypothetically here.  IF he could net us a proven veteran with team control, a middle rotation starter with team control, and a proven solid reliever with team control too, would you do it?    It's unlikely we'd be able to get that much, but IF it were available, would you think that'd be a good trade?"
Torontobluejays,3di98h,ImArcherVaderAMA,5,Thu Jul 16 16:54:52 2015 UTC,"It's been 22 years, if there's one franchise in Big 4 sports that should absolutely do what you just proposed, it's us."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,rsrsrsrs,4,Thu Jul 16 19:09:07 2015 UTC,The only players from the everyday roster that should be considered to be traded are Navarro and Edwin.
Torontobluejays,3di98h,allirow,3,Thu Jul 16 16:28:57 2015 UTC,Edwin has 10/5 now. Highly doubt he'd allow a trade.
Torontobluejays,3di98h,mcmadbat,4,Thu Jul 16 17:07:55 2015 UTC,Edwin would only be traded to a contender.  He would be of no value to a contending team.   Both the Mets and the Nationals (pitching rich teams) are know to want offense badly.  A deal similar to the Cespedes for Lester one last year could be used as a parallel.
Torontobluejays,3di98h,allirow,4,Thu Jul 16 17:13:06 2015 UTC,"Even if Edwin allows a trade, realistically you can only trade him to an AL Team as a DH. He's way more valuable playing for us"

Torontobluejays,3di98h,GodTuukka,2,Thu Jul 16 16:19:36 2015 UTC,"Trading Stroman only makes sense if you can get someone with a few years of control left, can help the rotation today and is likely to be a mainstay in the future. Doesn't sound like a lot of teams have that sort of pitcher and would be willing to give it up."

Torontobluejays,3di98h,baseball44121,2,Fri Jul 17 01:25:49 2015 UTC,My response
Torontobluejays,3di98h,9001,0,Fri Jul 17 05:28:09 2015 UTC,"I've been gung ho trade anyone...that stops at Stroman. I wouldn't trade him for Clayton Kershaw, I don't care. Stroman is a Blue Jay. He's the fucking man and he needs to be playing for us for years."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,HW_Plainview,20,Thu Jul 16 15:07:36 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't trade him for Clayton Kershaw   That's just stupid. I am all for keeping Stroman, but it's an absolute no brainer to let Stroman go if we could get Kershaw. Kershaw is a proven stud. He is a top pitcher in the league. Stroman at this point is pure potential. We would only be so lucky if Stroman turned to have the same career as Kershaw."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,BlueBlurDown,13,Thu Jul 16 15:23:30 2015 UTC,Actually Kershaw has a clause in his contract that allows him to void his contract at the end of the season if he is traded. So I wouldn't trade him for Kershaw either because he would only be a rental!
Torontobluejays,3di98h,kapacj,2,Thu Jul 16 15:57:46 2015 UTC,Okay that makes sense...did not realize he had a clause like that in his contract. Not that the Dodgers would ever trade Kershaw this year...
Torontobluejays,3di98h,thursday51,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:21:15 2015 UTC,When you trade for players you usually talk to them and negotiate with them. I would assume the Blue Jays would be smart enough to negotiate an extension if they didn't expect this to be a rental.
Torontobluejays,3di98h,BlueBlurDown,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:32:51 2015 UTC,You try and they never sign because they can hit the open market in like half a season and get way more money.
Torontobluejays,3di98h,kapacj,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:52:12 2015 UTC,"So you don't trade...    Most players will sign an extension. If you are offering them the same money they would get on the open market, they sign. If you aren't offering them fair value, they won't.    You either make the trade having signed an extension, make the trade knowing he's a rental, or you don't make the trade. Either way, in all situations, you know what's going on. Despite what some may believe, the Blue Jays management isn't clueless. They know what's going on."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,BlueBlurDown,-3,Fri Jul 17 10:55:15 2015 UTC,"Ya I don't care though, I'd make a shitty GM. Stroman is a guy who I've watched come up as an unproven guy getting suspended twice and everyone wondering who the hell he is. He's become a class act and an absolute warrior on the field and in his recovery. He handled his injury perfectly and I want to see the guy pitch for the Jays. Wouldn't trade him for anyone because a new pitcher couldn't rival the sight of Stroman on the mound for the Jays the day he gets back from rehab. All there is to it.  Now go and debate me on that, tell me how stupid that is."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,HW_Plainview,3,Thu Jul 16 15:35:49 2015 UTC,I think even Stroman would trade Stroman for Kershaw.   This is a silly debate. You're talking about acquiring the best pitcher in the majors for an injured rookie who had a good debut season. There's no doubt you do it in a heartbeat.
Torontobluejays,3di98h,gandalfsnutsack,3,Thu Jul 16 18:21:55 2015 UTC,"You're right, it is a silly debate. I now know that you should never say you wouldn't trade your favourite player for anybody unless you're ready for 20 armchair GM's telling you how wrong you are.  Give it a rest already."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,HW_Plainview,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:30:02 2015 UTC,You're an armchair GM as well. Don't think you aren't. You're just not a very good one if you take Stroman over Kershaw.
Torontobluejays,3di98h,gandalfsnutsack,0,Thu Jul 16 18:47:56 2015 UTC,"you are both wrong. One for thinking that Stroman is the same caliber as Kershaw, the other for thinking he would be a good fit on this team despite the fact that he would eat a huge part of our budget. We could have two very good starters for what Kershaw would cost. Mediocre steady pitching will win this team alot of games, we really don't need Cy Young."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,K-mag,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:44:56 2015 UTC,would you trade him for Archer?
Torontobluejays,3di98h,K-mag,0,Thu Jul 16 15:49:57 2015 UTC,No. Would you?
Torontobluejays,3di98h,HW_Plainview,4,Thu Jul 16 16:53:14 2015 UTC,"In a second. Proven ace on a team friendly deal. Stroman has shown lots, but there was a time when the same could be said about a lot of guys that ended up not panning out, its the old bird in the hand. Add in the fact that Archer is under team control for theoretically longer (Stroman may end up being a super two, but still look at Price). If Stro works out, he'll still be a 20m contract in his last years vs Chris Archer at half the price.     Only an idiot wouldn't make that deal. Best case deal it's a 10m cheaper ace. worst case its an ace over a bust. It's a deal that will never happen, but shows how much you really know, not that there is anything wrong with being a casual fan, but just quite acting like you have a remote clue on what you are talking about."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,K-mag,2,Thu Jul 16 16:54:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Stroman for Archer is a fucking no-brainer with Archer's contract."

Torontobluejays,3di98h,ExplainsSocialEnigma,0,Thu Jul 16 17:11:59 2015 UTC,those of us realists who follow the team realize that we are not the Yankees/Dodgers.
Torontobluejays,3di98h,K-mag,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:22:17 2015 UTC,"Those of us who've followed it longer know that the Blue Jays control the biggest exclusive media market in baseball, have the highest television ratings, have the most profitable television deal (i.e. the owners broadcast directly so they don't have to do an outsourcing deal), and have the richest owners.  The Blue Jays have always had the biggest market and they never should have stopped being the biggest spenders."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:35:09 2015 UTC,"We are still a top 10 team in payroll, once ownership sees increased revenues from a post season, I believe that will again change to the team that went out and spent on free agents in the 90s. We aren't the Yankees or Dodgers because we are a small market, but we have an owner that hasn't seen the value in spending big."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,K-mag,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:50:10 2015 UTC,We aren't the Yankees or Dodgers because we are a small market   We're not a small market. Toronto is by far the biggest exclusive media market (every game is a national broadcast) and it's a top-3 biggest single-team city (depending on how you define metropolitan areas and such).
Torontobluejays,3di98h,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:39:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's kinda what I ment. The owner feels that increase payroll would not correlate with increased revenues. The money is there to spend, it is believed that it's better in the shareholders pockets than the labour force, like any corporation."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,K-mag,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:53:09 2015 UTC,Source please.   I find it incredibly hard to believe the Jays have the biggest TV market in baseball over the Dodgers (3B Time Warner deal last year) and the Yankees.
Torontobluejays,3di98h,gandalfsnutsack,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:51:48 2015 UTC,"No American team has averaged ratings of more than 300,000 households in the past 3 years. Aside from the 2012 and 2014 Yankees, no team has even got 200,000. The Blue Jays average over 500,000 viewers.  That's what happens when a team has exclusive broadcasting territory over 35 Million people."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:13:09 2015 UTC,"This seems to be a clear case of viewership not equaling revenue gained from viewership. Jays rank 24th in overall attendance. The Dodgers are going to break 4M this year.   Also, Forbes listed the Jays franchise value as 22nd overall, between the Brewers and Rockies. If their TV revenue is as valuable as some claim, wouldn't that assessment be higher?  35m homes mean nothing. California alone has that many and so does Texas. The market for Yankees, Red Sox Dodgers and Cubs are more valuable than the market for the Jays."
Torontobluejays,3di98h,gandalfsnutsack,2,Thu Jul 16 18:53:09 2015 UTC,...I'd trade him for Kershaw in a second

Torontobluejays,3dia6p,Bryan__,5,Thu Jul 16 14:23:05 2015 UTC,"Not sure what the rules are regarding posting insider info, but he has Norris at #15, and Anthony Alford at #39.  Also of note, Franklin Barreto (prospect we traded to OAK in Donaldson trade) is #33."
Torontobluejays,3dia6p,Snidernomore,2,Thu Jul 16 14:24:09 2015 UTC,"ya – i noticed Barreto has surged up all the mid-season prospect rankings (tho I'm not sure why as his numbers this year are nothing special compared to last – just one level higher).   Law is the first I'm seeing to include Alford (and not Hoffman or Pompey). Alford has been killing it in A-ball and is one of five all-stars on the Lugnuts (along with Rowdy Tellez, Ryan McBroom, Richard Urena and Shane Dawson – who is playing for team Canada in the Pan Am games)"
Torontobluejays,3dia6p,BettyWhiteOnSteroids,7,Thu Jul 16 14:33:07 2015 UTC,Being a 19YR/SS jumping two levels with a >800 OPS is pretty fantastic.
Torontobluejays,3dia6p,DoggMoney,5,Thu Jul 16 15:07:05 2015 UTC,true. -3.6 age difference.
Torontobluejays,3dia6p,UglyMuffins,2,Thu Jul 16 15:09:56 2015 UTC,I think having Alford over Hoffman is a little crazy.
Torontobluejays,3dia6p,pooryorrickent,5,Thu Jul 16 14:33:57 2015 UTC,"Me too but Alford is a very interesting prospect. Remember he's hardly played baseball since being drafted due to football commitments. This is his first real season of professional ball and he is killing it. He has excellent speed, incredible arm and athletic ability to go along with a lightning-quick bat. Still just 20. May turn out to be our best prospect if the power develops. Stolen 18 bases in 21 attempts so far and is currently on a 16 game hitting streak."
Torontobluejays,3dia6p,UglyMuffins,3,Thu Jul 16 14:57:11 2015 UTC,"the scary thing is he hasn't shown he can hit for power but his swing has enough to generate +20 HR.  And his on base skills can definitely compliment his speed, unlike guys like Hamilton.  So here you have a 20/20, plus defender, high OBP outfielder with strong leadership skills."

Fangraphs ran a piece about percieved velocity and stride has a ton to do with it. Y. Ventura's fastball when it runs to 97-98 only looks about 94 to batters, in part because of his short stride and over the top delivery. Despite a top-3 hardest fastball and wicked curve, Ventura only average 7.6 SO/9 - Sanchez despite great stuff doesn't strike people out, and Hoffman hasn't early on."
Torontobluejays,3dia6p,BettyWhiteOnSteroids,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:11:18 2015 UTC,Really disappointing if true.

Plus the date of his return will be during the most competitive portion of the season. I can see him in the Pen if the Jays decide not to sit him until next season.
Torontobluejays,3dhwis,fromTO,2,Thu Jul 16 16:19:07 2015 UTC,If Stroman gets 3 or 4 big league starts before that he's fine. It's not like his first game back would be the wildcard...although that would be an epic return.
Torontobluejays,3dhwis,HW_Plainview,3,Thu Jul 16 16:26:06 2015 UTC,"It doesn't usually work out that we can just give it to whoever wants, it's most likely just whoever's next in the rotation.

Torontobluejays,3dhwis,HW_Plainview,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:19:22 2015 UTC,His splits last year were not the exact opposite. His home ERA 4.73 and his road ERA was 4.33 with the difference not being substantial or significantly notable. That's nothing compared to 2.21/8.81 this season or 2.36/6.47 in his rookie year. His career is 3.39/5.77 for home/road.

Torontobluejays,3di3sv,ExplainsSocialEnigma,5,Thu Jul 16 16:39:27 2015 UTC,"From MLB Trade Rumours:  The Blue Jays are “regularly being asked for Marcus Stroman” as a return in trades for pitching, reports Shi Davidi of Sportsnet. Despite the fact that Stroman won’t contribute to the team in 2015 after tearing his ACL this spring, the Blue Jays won’t be trading him, Davidi writes. Looking at the trade history of GM Alex Anthopoulos, Davidi notes that it’s probably more likely to see the Blue Jays acquire someone with some team control remaining. He lists the Padres as a speculative trade partner, noting that both Andrew Cashner and Tyson Ross would fit that mold. Acquiring a starter or two would allow the Blue Jays to transfer Aaron Sanchez to the bullpen to help fix the team’s relief woes, though trade possibilities exist there, too. Jonathan Papelbon said at yesterday’s All-Star festivities that he considered the Jays a “good fit” and would waive his no-trade clause to go there."

Torontobluejays,3di3sv,AF1991,2,Thu Jul 16 15:01:50 2015 UTC,It's tempting but I'd much rather have a really nice cost effective rotation that includes Stroman Hoffman Norris and Hutchison. Toss in osuna sanchez and castro in the pen and that is grounds for a pretty solid staff.   There's also been talk of moving Edwin for T Walker and Carson Smith.

I love Reyes and Buehrle, but giving up five prospects, our starting shortstop, and our backup catcher for the right to pay them 20+ million each in their sunset years is simply not a great deal.  Many of the guys we traded away are still young so we can't really make a definitive judgement on them. A few of them are starting to make a real impact in the major leagues.   More importantly though, I think we simply could have traded them for a much much much better return."
Torontobluejays,3dj28b,Born_Ruff,2,Thu Jul 16 20:08:52 2015 UTC,"Josh Johnson's injury issues is why the deal looks bad. I know it was dumb to make an oft injured player the centerpiece of the deal in the first place, but Johnson performs as we hoped him to and the trade's a steal. The Dickey trade, however..."
Torontobluejays,3dj28b,NoPlansTonight,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:44:09 2015 UTC,"This, 100%. Johnson had potential to be a very, very good pitcher. His injury concerns made it a gamble and sadly it did not pay off, but it wasn't a terrible gamble to make considering it didn't cost us the arm and a leg some people make it out to be.   The prospects we gave up still have very major questions about their ability to be anything more than replacement-level players. And if we're complaining about getting more out of our trades, the discrepancy between what we sold Thor/DL'naurd for is infinitely more than what sold a group of B-rated prospects for.   At the worst, the Miami trade is a wash. The Dickey trade fails to be a wash even at its best."
Torontobluejays,3dj28b,pooryorrickent,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:20:49 2015 UTC,"but Johnson performs as we hoped him to and the trade's a steal.   The whole premise of my comment is ""if we could go back in time"".  Obviously when the trade went down it seemed like an unreal deal for us. In retrospect, it didn't work out very well for us."
Torontobluejays,3dj28b,Born_Ruff,2,Fri Jul 17 02:20:00 2015 UTC,"Depends on how some of the prospects play out, but even with Josh Johnson's flameout, the move went as intended. The Jays got a lot of production in the seasons following the deal and the Marlins will get production later on.   The only reason not to do the deal is if the Jays decided to punt on 2013-2014, which it really is far from obvious - even in retrospect - that that was the thing to do."
Torontobluejays,3dj28b,Foltbolt,2,Thu Jul 16 21:19:34 2015 UTC,"If we are just trading for JR and MB, we wouldn't have given them nearly as much value back in return.  It's not like the deal with the Miami was the only possible trade they could make that year."
Torontobluejays,3dj28b,Born_Ruff,2,Thu Jul 16 21:25:23 2015 UTC,"It's a little cheap to argue from retrospect, but let's not forget that JJ was a risky bet, and so were all of those prospects we sent over. It was also possible that JJ pitched great but MB finally had his arm explode after all that heavy work. That's the point of bringing on everyone that they did -- is that it maximizes the chances you do get something worthwhile for the trade."
Torontobluejays,3dj28b,Foltbolt,4,Fri Jul 17 01:58:51 2015 UTC,"The offence is reeeeaaallly reeeaaalllly good. All teams struggle to score runs some games- that's baseball. There is no team that scores 5 runs every single game. People complain that this team isn't consistent, when in reality, no team is."
Torontobluejays,3dj28b,kapacj,3,Thu Jul 16 18:54:06 2015 UTC,"What? The team is currently at 55% more oWAR than the next closest team.

Torontobluejays,3di8lr,brownmagician,2,Thu Jul 16 17:30:23 2015 UTC,"OK, I'm pretty raw on this debate and my current opinions can change very quickly. At this point, I sort of look at it in the way that I'd rather score a run than not give up a run. This is based on the fact that teams average much less than one run per inning and the idea that it is impossible to win a game without scoring any runs.  When you score a run you are increasing your chances of winning at a much greater rate then saving a run. Saving runs still requires you to score runs to win games.  I don't know, someone tell me how wrong I am and why."
Torontobluejays,3di8lr,darth-helmet,2,Thu Jul 16 18:15:59 2015 UTC,"Look going back at it, runs given up usually result from the pitcher and not the fielder. Run creation should be priority and run prevent should fall on the pitcher more. Our FIP needs to come down"
Torontobluejays,3di8lr,cookiemountain18,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:49:00 2015 UTC,"Look going back at it, runs given up usually result from the pitcher and not the fielder   Are you making the point that position players are responsible for 100% of run creation but a much smaller proportion of run prevention (say 20%) because the pitcher is responsible for the rest of the run prevention (say 80%).  That's fair. And it implies that the average position player's job is 5 part run recreation to 1 part run prevention. But the average player bats 5th and plays 3B or RF or something. He's not a 9-hitting SS (as Goins is and as Reyes ought to be).   For a 9-hitting SS the glove is much, much more important than 1:5. He'll get 4 PA per game but will also get 3 assists and 2 putouts (more if he's good).  And then we have to attempt to quantify what the differences actually are. Reyes is a better hitter, but how much better? Goins has actually hit better at SS (99 wRC+) this year than Reyes has (93 wRC+). Goins is a better defender, but how much is that worth? An out per game? If so, that would make him astronomically more valuable than Reyes. An out per week? Well then the difference in the bat should more then compensate."
Torontobluejays,3di8lr,floatate,0,Thu Jul 16 23:27:53 2015 UTC,"As someone who grew up watching baseball before advanced stats I tend to still evaluate players the old fashioned way using the standard stats and simply watching them play. I'm not saying sabermetrics are bad or have no value, but rather often you simply don't even need stats in front of you to tell if a player is worth his lick or not.  I always tell myself one day I'm going to really learn the new metrics but as I grow older I find i have less time and less focus to do so. I think working with data as a part of my job also makes me want to tune it out of my personal life a bit.  That said, I see where Wilner is coming from in that no one stat can perfectly sum up a players ability or value and that every data point has it's ""noise"" as he calls it. I also however think he's a bit like many other older generation fans who didn't grow up with sabermetrics and can often be a little too quick to dismiss their value."
Torontobluejays,3di8lr,jediofpool,-1,Thu Jul 16 20:33:53 2015 UTC,"I don't know shit about advanced statistics and am not the biggest stat head out there for any sport that I like to follow.    But I agree with Mike on this and it translates to other sports as well.  I don't think any statistic can sum up a players production 100%.  Sports are way too unpredictable and have so many elements involved that players can't control.  Edit: I remember this call and enjoyed it alot.

Torontobluejays,3dg4kh,Tyoung1110,4,Thu Jul 16 00:24:32 2015 UTC,Fun fact time!  Out of all qualified starters with at least 1.5 fWAR Drew Hutchison is the only one with an ERA over 5.
Torontobluejays,3dg4kh,allirow,8,Thu Jul 16 02:30:14 2015 UTC,"It's funny that by fWAR, he's actually a better pitcher than last year.  Last year he finished at 2.3 fWAR in 184.2 innings  So far this year, he has 1.6 fWAR in 98 innings, which puts him pretty close to the likes of Scott Kazmir, Yovani Gallardo, and Matt Harvey.  FIP (3.65) and xFIP (3.78) both love him.  He's practically Cy Young when pitching at home (2.12 ERA, .218/.267/.290 opponents slash, by comparison, Clayton Kershaw's home splits are 1.87 ERA and a .200/.246/.300 slash).  Whatever is causing him to suck on the road, hopefully the all-star break does him a world of good."
Torontobluejays,3dg4kh,allirow,6,Thu Jul 16 00:40:19 2015 UTC,Let's hope his second half performance lines up with his peripherals.
Torontobluejays,3dg4kh,kapacj,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:06:37 2015 UTC,"If it does, that'll be a MASSIVE boon to the rotation, especially if they add 1-2 more starters."

Torontobluejays,3dg4kh,Garamor,3,Thu Jul 16 02:09:41 2015 UTC,The splits are almost certainly noise for that reason.
Torontobluejays,3dg4kh,ExplainsSocialEnigma,3,Thu Jul 16 03:33:09 2015 UTC,"Similar to the numbers that Cole Hamels has in interleague play (4 something ERA), that reporters like bringing up as reasons that an AL team won't want him."
Torontobluejays,3dg4kh,allirow,4,Thu Jul 16 11:17:13 2015 UTC,"One thing to remember, he doesn't even have 2 full years under his belt yet.  He's only made 61 starts at the MLB level (68 starts would roughly equate to 2 years).  He's realistically still figuring things out."
Torontobluejays,3dg4kh,allirow,3,Thu Jul 16 02:16:37 2015 UTC,"Media really keeps harping on Hutch, but Dickey has been the 2nd worst starter in the entire MLB this year."
Torontobluejays,3dg4kh,69putout,5,Thu Jul 16 02:16:00 2015 UTC,"Hutch has a higher ERA.  The media has to play to the masses, and the masses don't get sabermetrics."
Torontobluejays,3dg4kh,allirow,7,Thu Jul 16 02:24:40 2015 UTC,"That's a strange thing to say: nobody who gets sabermetrics would say that Dickey is the 2nd-worst starter this year. Yes, he's 2nd-worst in FIP, but even Fangraphs tells you to not use FIP to evaluate Dickey.   [W]e strongly suggest that you use RA9-wins to evaluate a knuckleball pitcher, not FIP-wins. Dickey has outperformed what our standard WAR suggests, and he’s likely to do so going forward as well. He’s a known exception to the rule. If you want to quote Dickey’s FanGraphs WAR, you’re better off using RA9-wins than FIP-wins   http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/war-for-knuckleballers/"
Torontobluejays,3dg4kh,ExplainsSocialEnigma,6,Thu Jul 16 03:27:17 2015 UTC,"I don't feel Dickey is the 2nd worst pitcher in baseball, and i feel he gets a lot of unnecessary hate here strictly based off what we gave up for him, which is not his fault.   He's had a good stretch as the season goes on.  He had the same problem in 2013 and 2014, he's slow to get out of the gate, but gets better as the season goes on. The worse part of it though, is that in 2014 it took longer than 2013, and in 2015 it's taken longer than 2014.  I think 2015 should be his last year with the team though.  I have a feeling it'll take even longer in 2016."
Torontobluejays,3dg4kh,allirow,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:44:45 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but even by ra9 he is in the bottom quarter of qualified starters. He definitely feels like he is one of the worst which FIP does capture at least perpetually.

Torontobluejays,3db7nt,Cogwall,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:44:42 2015 UTC,"It'll take at least 10 years, and closer to 20. They need a new ballpark with a downtown address. They need a HUGE preliminary season ticket offering response. They need between 1 and 2 billion dollars.  They also need to unseat a current team; an often discussed possibility is the Tampa Bay Rays but the guy who owns that team, Stuart Steinberg won't be giving up the Trop anytime soon.  And that's what you need: the owner to sell. The expos were up for sale but no one bought it. The MLB took ownership under very hesitant circumstances. They didn't want to move the team, they wanted a company to buy it, build a new park. As time went by, offers came in for different cities, Washington spits on ground gave a good pitch and now they have our Expos.  Moving the Rays to Montreal will be even more expensive. You first have to buy the team, then build the park. Rob Manfred seems open to the idea, but there are no plans for expansion at this time. I can't find the exact article, but a lot of MLB executives are apparently still bitter about Montreal. Again, that is changing with Manfred at the helm.   A billion dollars to get a team off the ground is doable. Montreal is a stabler city than it was 11 years ago. The city has shown it can fill a stadium for a two-game, interleague pre-season series twice in a row. The next step is maybe a MLB Season Opener game in Montreal. The Dodgers and Diamondbacks played it in Sydney, Australia last year: Montreal is a 40-minute plane trip from new york/detroit/toronto/philly.   I WANT A TEAM IN MONTREAL. I'd go to at least a couple of series every year. I'd love to have a national league team in my country to cheer for."
Torontobluejays,3db7nt,jolthax,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:20:46 2015 UTC,/u/Royal_Flush13 what's your opinion on Montreal's economic feasibility?
Torontobluejays,3db7nt,Snidernomore,0,Wed Jul 15 01:48:37 2015 UTC,"Relatively uninformed as I don't live in Québec but I am extremely confident that baseball would succeed - hell even thrive - in Montréal if they had committed ownership and a downtown stadium that is as accessible and close to happy hour bars as the SkyDome.  The after work bar scene (cinq à sept) is huge in Montréal so games scheduled for 7:10 within a short walk would draw great crowds of locals. And if they're in the AL East they would play 1/3 of their home games against the Jays, Red Sox, and Yankees who all have legions of fans at any road games - not to mention easily driveable ones from any of those cities.  Baseball's popularity in Québec was never the issue, and when they were competitive in the 80s they had some of the best attendance numbers (tops in the league a couple times).   I'm not holding my breath though. Much like a new Nordiques team, expansion is the only real option as far as I can tell."
Torontobluejays,3db7nt,Royal_Flush13,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:36:32 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking that they would need a strong owner to support and be extremely patient. As another commenter mentioned, Bell Media could be interesting from a competition standpoint with Rogers. As much as people complain Rogers has given the team an above average payroll, but more so that there's not a big imperative to run a big profit as there would be with a team such as the Pirates. The Jays value to Rogers' goes way beyond the team, and I'm thinking that Bell may want to get in on it.  Most people despise Corporate Ownership though. Regardless, I think above all they would need a stable owner, and willing to invest in as you say a new stadium. The list of candidates aren't very long I'm thinking that are going to be willing to do that.  I'm also thinking Pierre Karl Péladreau may be filling to be the face, having dealt with Bell before and having experience in media - as well as a Québec sovereignist."

Torontobluejays,3db7nt,SteveDougson,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:01:24 2015 UTC,"The park was a big part of it. But I wouldn't be able to do justice to telling the story of their demise. I recommend looking to baseball writer and Expos fan Jonah Keri to get the details.  But basically, their owner deserted them, the Big O absolutely sucks and a planned downtown ballpark deal fell through, they couldn't negotiate broadcast rights, they were bought by the league and basically forced to be uncompetitive by their new overlords, and the fans got sick of it and saw that the end was near and that there really was no point in supporting them anymore. Oh and the strike stopped the best season they ever had and took away any hope that may have been left."
Torontobluejays,3db7nt,Royal_Flush13,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:16:29 2015 UTC,"I read that book, it's a great read. All the things you said were true, I'd also argue that the Expos just had a lot of bad luck. They had some great teams that didn't even make the playoffs. Also, all the post-Bronfman owners (the Consortium and Loria) were awful. The former were incredibly cheap, allowing Loria to basically take control of the team when he got into the picture."
Torontobluejays,3da0el,Lockstock93,11,Tue Jul 14 17:41:20 2015 UTC,"The Jays will at some point have to acquire at least two decent veteran (and by veteran I mean pitchers with at least 300 IP under their belt) for next season's rotation.  Norris isn't exactly lighting the barn on fire in AAA. Sanchez currently has BB/K numbers reminscent of Kyle Drabek, and yeah, Drabek was able to throw together 3-4 starts (by ERA) in a row.  Hutchison shows promise but has about 330 IP of crumbling when runners get on base, reminscent of another ex Blue Jay - Brandon Morrow. Whatever it is, mechanical or mental, that needs to be fixed.  Maybe Osuna can make the jump. Stroman will probably be very good. But looking at next year's rotation:   Stroman Hutchison ? ? ?   Buerhle is gone. Dickey has an option but his command is in clear decline, as his his knuckle. He's old too: his bread and butter is throwing the pitch upwards of 75 MPH, as the body weakens, that's going to have it's effects. Wakefield kept an ERA around the upper 4's in his 40's but also didn't throw a ton of innings (relative) for a starter. Estrada has been decent, no complaints.  So if Dickey isn't in there, are you ready to want to contend with three of Sanchez/Norris/Hutchison in the rotation? Or if they bring back Dickey+Estrada, that's looking like Stroman/Estrada/Hutchison/Dickey and one of Sanchez or Norris. That looks awful.  Doesn't have to happen at the trade dealine sure. But relying on the young pitching is not a strategy I want to try."
Torontobluejays,3da0el,Snidernomore,2,Tue Jul 14 17:59:38 2015 UTC,I'd like the Jays to go after Fister and Lackey in the off-season if they don't land any starters.
Torontobluejays,3da0el,allirow,4,Tue Jul 14 18:06:05 2015 UTC,"I don't mind one of them but not both filling up two spots. Fister might be 4 (5?) years younger than Lackey but certainly pitches older, and he looks to be safely be in decline.  If you don't bring back Estrada/Dickey/Buerhle that's ~$40 million by my calculations.  I'd like to go big on Zimmerman. $20 million or so. Then a Lackey/Kazmir/Latos."
Torontobluejays,3da0el,Snidernomore,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:13:07 2015 UTC,I've long coveted Latos.
Torontobluejays,3da0el,allirow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:32:50 2015 UTC,There is quite a few nice options in FA this year for pitchers.
Torontobluejays,3da0el,kapacj,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:33:25 2015 UTC,"Sanchez has improved immensely, though, and has given up far fewer walks in his last few starts. I'm perfectly fine with having him in the rotation."
Torontobluejays,3da0el,porpoiseslayer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:51:49 2015 UTC,"Best post in the thread by far, and you paint a pretty bleak picture for next season's rotation.  I think we need to get a legitimate ace signed for a few years on this team, and it needs to happen as soon as possible.  After that I think we try and make a playoff push, and if it fails then we trade off these old guys and do a rebuild, this time from the rotation outward.  The experiment of hitting based teams is over for me, and it's looking mediocre with the best hitting lineup we've had in forever.  Give me a team that has 4/5 great starters and a solid bullpen anyday."
Torontobluejays,3da0el,Morphine_Jesus,12,Wed Jul 15 09:47:10 2015 UTC,I don't like the idea. Who knows how good the AL East will be next year? I think we need to go for it this year since we're still right in the race.
Torontobluejays,3da0el,pdjmcvit,3,Tue Jul 14 18:05:32 2015 UTC,I'm with you fundamentally but I just don't know how we're going to acquire enough pitching talent with so little time left. Realistically we need at least 2 starters and a reliever.
Torontobluejays,3da0el,ilikehockey2,2,Tue Jul 14 19:27:30 2015 UTC,"Or 1 starter, a reliever, and prayers to the rehab gods that Stroman can pitch well in September. I agree though that how/what can we trade to get enough help - I just don't think there is enough without free-flowing cash from Rogers."
Torontobluejays,3da0el,withershin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:10:43 2015 UTC,"There is no way that the front office would allow Stroman to pitch this season. It's not worth it. If they are in contention in September, then that means they will be playing very well, and they won't need him. If they aren't in contention then they also won't need him.  Either way, they don't need him. Stroman will be here in April 2016. End of story. Anything else would be a terrible risk to his future."
Torontobluejays,3da0el,cozeners,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:30:03 2015 UTC,The 2 starters are necessary but the reliever is probably optional. The bullpen has actually always been fine and would be further-fortified by kicking some starters to it.
Torontobluejays,3da0el,ExplainsSocialEnigma,2,Tue Jul 14 21:17:18 2015 UTC,"agreed, kicking Sanchez to the bullpen would be huge."
Torontobluejays,3da0el,ismizz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:28:12 2015 UTC,"I disagree, and I think this mentality is exactly the kind that led to the jays trading away Syndergaard and d'arnaud because who knows now is the opportunity to strike and the jays may never ever get another chance like this. What happened? Jays slid down to their usual spot and didn't even sniff the playoffs."
Torontobluejays,3da0el,baseballfan901,5,Wed Jul 15 03:19:06 2015 UTC,Problem I see with this year is we need to pick up too many pitching pieces before the trade deadline to really make a splash. How is AA going to pick up 2 starters and a reliever (which is minimum how far we seem to be away) before the deadline?
Torontobluejays,3da0el,ilikehockey2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:25:02 2015 UTC,I think picking up 2 starters would simultaneously fix the BP issues cause we could shift Sanchez to a late-inning role.
Torontobluejays,3da0el,ismizz,2,Wed Jul 15 20:33:47 2015 UTC,"You're probably right, we'd be in a good spot with two starters."
Torontobluejays,3da0el,ilikehockey2,3,Wed Jul 15 20:36:40 2015 UTC,"I lean towards making a couple moves, but nothing that involves major pieces for the future, multiple especially.  I know, I know, there are no guarantees, but the truth is, there are no guarantees that the guys you bring in will perform, either.  I'd love to see moves where the Jays ownership agrees to take on salary, spend some money.  (Bob McGowan keeps talking about trading for Cueto and Votto in a cost cutting move for the Reds, which is damned unlikely, but interesting as a concept)"

I don't think most people would want to give up what we would have to in order for that to happen. If they don't want to eat much or any of it, I'm fine with it since it is just money, but I don't think that's a deal that Rogers is going to give the go ahead to."

Then the deadline comes and goes and AA says ""the price was too high"" and MLB gets their wish with the Blue Jays fading fast and this avoids taking away ESPN's ""game of the week"" trillion dollar revenue from the Yankees and Orioles."
Torontobluejays,3da0el,ExplainsSocialEnigma,3,Wed Jul 15 07:33:38 2015 UTC,"The kids might be better, but the dads will be worse.  All of the following players will be 30 or older next year (if they even play for the Blue Jays at all): Dickey, Buerhle, Bautista, Martin, Encarnacaion, Reyes, Colabello, Estrada, Delabar, Valencia, Donaldson, and Schultz. And that's not counting a few marginal players.  That's a huge chunk of our core that can be expected to decline, get injured, or leave. You'd need to bank on a major, major improvement from the young guys to compensate for that expected loss."
Torontobluejays,3da0el,allirow,6,Tue Jul 14 21:14:06 2015 UTC,"The thing is,  prospects are a crapshoot.  They may pan out, they may not.  The Jays are in a prime position this year and next, as they'll have almost the same team on the field next year.  We know what our needs are, and 2 solid pitchers and a reliever should be enough to put us over that hump.  By acquiring good starters with control beyond this season, the Jays can bank on their performance next year, instead of rolling the dice.  Just look at Castro and Osuna.  One panned out, one didn't.   Look at Travis and Pompey.  One panned out, one didn't.   The Jays need stability, that's why they should make a non-rental deal."
Torontobluejays,3da0el,allirow,3,Tue Jul 14 17:47:01 2015 UTC,Pompey hasn't panned out yet.
Torontobluejays,3da0el,jaysrapsleafs,7,Tue Jul 14 17:50:24 2015 UTC,"True, same with Castro.  They didn't pan out in their initial run.  i meant that we were planning on relying on them for 2015, and now we can't."

Torontobluejays,3d6ceq,ExplainsSocialEnigma,5,Mon Jul 13 23:35:51 2015 UTC,When we allow 5+ runs in the first inning it isn't possible to always pull them and rely on the pen

Torontobluejays,3d6ceq,ExplainsSocialEnigma,2,Tue Jul 14 00:41:04 2015 UTC,"Well, the Royals have Wade Davis and Greg Holland in their bullpen, they can afford to lean on their bullpen more than we can."

Torontobluejays,3d6ceq,ExplainsSocialEnigma,2,Tue Jul 14 01:16:55 2015 UTC,I am. It's much better than Toronto's. Which is why that approach wouldn't  work here.
Torontobluejays,3d6ceq,ExplainsSocialEnigma,-2,Tue Jul 14 01:25:06 2015 UTC,No you're not. The Blue Jays have a much better bullpen than the Rays. The approach would work even better here.

Torontobluejays,3d6ceq,ExplainsSocialEnigma,-2,Tue Jul 14 01:49:36 2015 UTC,heir pen has thrown more innings than any other team   That's their strategy and that's exactly what I've been talking about the whole time.
Torontobluejays,3d6ceq,Snidernomore,2,Tue Jul 14 01:53:56 2015 UTC,This is a horrible idea.
Torontobluejays,3d6ceq,allirow,14,Mon Jul 13 23:59:26 2015 UTC,"You're right.  It's so horrible that the Rays have achieved top-5 pitching in spite of having 4 of their starters injured and by running a AAA bullpen.  Their back-of-the-rotation strategy is to run a replacement-level starter out there and have him pitch to 18 batters, put in a replacement-level longman in there to bridge the gap, and turn it over to the permanent bullpen. Then they option the starter and the longman and call up fresh arms. They've gone through about 25 pitchers this way and it fucking works. They're among the best in the league in team ERA, FIP, and xFIP and they're last in the league in batters faced by starters.  We do the opposite and it doesn't. We leave in our starters too long until they get shelled. We bring in our relievers and keep the appearances too short (and thus too frequent), and we rarely call up reinforcements. That's why we're there at the bottom among the last in starter ERA, FIP, and xFIP but among the leaders in starter batters faced. We exacerbate the situation by doing stupid shit that burns our relievers - namely we put important relievers in ""just to get work"" and we don't carry 8 relievers."

Torontobluejays,3d6ceq,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:52:41 2015 UTC,"The only issue is that Torontos current relief corps isn't really built to handle something like that, they're constructed like a more 'traditional' bullpen.   One has to hope the continued success of the Royals system opens more eyes across MLB, just like the A's and 'Moneyball' did."

So they're stalking me with downvotes.
Torontobluejays,3d6ceq,allirow,3,Tue Jul 14 03:04:44 2015 UTC,"Calling people idiots isn't a way to change downvotes.  I've personally never downvoted you (even when you called me a cunt) because i only downvote trolls like truejaywasright.  I agree with you on Reyes being not a good leadoff option vs what we have, and the Royals system is something that I hope opens more eyes across MLB.

Torontobluejays,3d6ceq,ExplainsSocialEnigma,-1,Tue Jul 14 11:41:30 2015 UTC,"I called you a cunt because you said that I was obsessed with Reyes, a stalker of Goins, and that Reyes fucked my wife.

Torontobluejays,3d6ceq,swabfalling,2,Tue Jul 14 13:18:00 2015 UTC,"The Reyes comment (and the initial one about the obsession/stalkerish part) were meant to be tongue in cheek.  However, i have no Internet service at home right now and have to do all this on my phone, where it's significantly more difficult to type out and process my thoughts to typing (i hate typing on a touchscreen, I use a mechanical keyboard at home).  Upon re-reading my comments, they certainly didn't come off the way that I had intended.  One of the main reasons I continue to reply to you in threads is because I like differing viewpoints, even if I'm vehemently against them.  A proper running sub takes all viewpoints to run properly, and we need people presenting from all sides of the spectrum.

Torontobluejays,3d6ceq,allirow,2,Tue Jul 14 16:03:51 2015 UTC,Good points. I like the idea.   The only question is do we have the depth at starters/long men to be able to do this as effectively?
Torontobluejays,3d6ceq,MC29,2,Tue Jul 14 03:05:53 2015 UTC,"Probably. The Rays do this with replacement-level players. You don't really need good relievers. It works because fresh, replacement-level relievers are better than tired, non-elite starters. Fresh Chad Jenkins is better than tired 8th-inning Dickey and that's really all there is to it.  KC is the version with excellent relievers."
Torontobluejays,3d6ceq,baconperogies,2,Tue Jul 14 03:12:14 2015 UTC,Jenkins and Sanchez would be 2 of the best internal options for this.  The two of them along with Osuna could do quite well being able to do 2 innings at a time.

Torontobluejays,3d6ceq,CornOnTheHob,2,Mon Jul 13 21:42:00 2015 UTC,"If it's just about the money then I would try to make it fit. With the contracts coming off the books next year we would be in decent shape to absorb his option as long as we still had the young arms to pencil into the rotation. If the Phillies are trying to get a viable prospect from us for him though I'd hope that they would be offering to eat at least 50% of his salary, especially with that $16 million option. Paps is good but $16 million is a bit rich when we also might be trying to add another starter or two."
Torontobluejays,3d6ceq,69putout,4,Mon Jul 13 23:07:43 2015 UTC,"If the Phillies don't eat any salary, he is worth a bag of baseballs. If they eat a good portion of his salary, he might be worth a Sean Reid-Foley at the most."
Torontobluejays,3d6ceq,Garrison_Creeker,10,Mon Jul 13 21:47:40 2015 UTC,"He's a well established closer, he is not worth a bag of baseballs.  His contract isnt great but he's a major league asset that would help a contender."
Torontobluejays,3d6ceq,Snidernomore,9,Mon Jul 13 22:16:22 2015 UTC,"$13M a year, he isn't worth giving up an asset to take on that contract. He is the highest paid reliever in the game by a good margin. David Robertson and Andrew Miller, both much younger with more recent successes make less than him despite signing recent contracts.  If money wasn't a factor at all, he'd be worth a middling pitching prospect."

Torontobluejays,3d77yn,mcmadbat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:39:21 2015 UTC,"I did not forget any of those.   This is a development year for Hoffman - a 3.21 ERA/6.1 K/9 in A+ ball (non-Cal League) for a college senior is not very impressive. His numbers are like that because they had him throwing only fastballs, which should indicate to you where he is in his development. He is not on track for next year at this point.  Reid-Foley has flashed impressiveness, but his career mark of 5.7 BB/9 and 8 innings at A+ again indicate that he is no where near on track for being a starter next season.  Osuna could, but I like him in the pen for another year.  Castro had a below-average ERA of 4.38/FIP of 4.70 as a reliever this season, and 5.93/7.34 marks as a starter in AAA. He only has ~40 innings of starts above A- ball. Even his numbers in A ball aren't exactly dominant, and I really hope there is no expectation of him being a key part of the 2016 rotation."
Torontobluejays,3d77yn,allirow,3,Tue Jul 14 02:38:09 2015 UTC,"Castro should stay in A ball and work his way up normally.  It was a great story in spring training, but a failed experiment."

Torontobluejays,3d4qci,northdancer,3,Mon Jul 13 16:49:33 2015 UTC,I always liked the Braves because I played little league for them and that Glavine/Smoltz/Maddox was just amazing to watch. But I'll always like the loveable loser Cubbies aswell.
Torontobluejays,3d4qci,klucas31,3,Mon Jul 13 15:31:40 2015 UTC,Braves for me as well. I used to watch a lot of random Braves games on TBS back in the day. Skip Caray and Don Sutton and Pete van Wieren were great.
Torontobluejays,3d4qci,isthiseric,2,Mon Jul 13 16:08:05 2015 UTC,I think there's an entire generation of Braves fans across the continent thanks to TBS.
Torontobluejays,3d4qci,klucas31,2,Mon Jul 13 16:51:30 2015 UTC,It was cool. ESP before extra innings and inter league. It was fun seeing NL teams. Plus the Braves were just fun to watch. It was cool seeing jays/Braves games on tbs and get an away perspective since we never have games on fox or ESPN SNB

So naturally, I thought the Expos were awesome.  Tim Raines was the man, loved Gary Carter, and The Hawk was awesome too.  My grandparents live in San Francisco and would have Giants games on in the summers when we went down to visit, so naturally, Giants are my NL team by default now.  Although for some reason, I never really took that much pleasure in their WS wins...it's just....not the same as rooting for your true blue home team."

Loved Pujols and Isringhausen, Edmonds, Walker etc growing up, plus I remember going to an inter-league game when I was younger and seeing Carpenter throw a one-hitter against us. Plus being a Toronto sports fan, and a Liverpool FC fan, it's nice to have a team that wins. Given, I don't care for the Cards NEARLY as much as I care for the Jays and my other Toronto teams, but come playoff time, when the Jays are out of the picture, I 'support' the Cardinals."
Torontobluejays,3d4qci,Pbrisebois,2,Mon Jul 13 20:20:00 2015 UTC,"No. I'm indifferent to them.  As a bitter and disgruntled Jays fan, I do always cheer for the NL team in the World Series solely based on ""if the Jays can't win it, fuck the rest of the AL""."

Torontobluejays,3d5s5f,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:52:02 2015 UTC,Saunders hasn't even resumed baseball activities as of a week ago. I forget where I read it or heard it but I'm fairly certain that is correct.  I'm fine with Pillar in CF but we cannot keep running Collabello out in LF. As good as his bat has been his defence is so bad that he's been worth 0.3 fWAR and is likely to fall into negative territory over the next few weeks.

Torontobluejays,3d5s5f,TheGursh,2,Mon Jul 13 21:03:20 2015 UTC,Definitely not until he puts up some good numbers in AAA for a few weeks.  Wouldn't surprise me if we don't see him with the Jays until September unless there are multiple injuries.

Torontobluejays,3d5s5f,hoytaylo,0,Mon Jul 13 19:46:17 2015 UTC,who is saying that?
Torontobluejays,3d5s5f,ExplainsSocialEnigma,3,Mon Jul 13 21:18:36 2015 UTC,It's always been that way. Many of the best pitchers skip AAA. AA pitchers also throw harder because they're younger; AAA has a lot of older failed major leaguers who can't throw hard. PCL and the IL are two of the most offence-heavy leagues in the minors.
Torontobluejays,3d5s5f,hoytaylo,3,Mon Jul 13 21:58:56 2015 UTC,"exactly what has been said, AAA host many failed major leaguers; look a buffalo for example: francis, albers, redmond, wolf, etc (in a sense AAA acts has a hold for depth in emergency, and AA is a place where prospects can flourish and develop)  its not uncommon to see many players advance straight from AA"

Just to explain a bit clearer, I get that memes are simple and easy to read with a point in them, so anytime someone suggests ""ban memes"" you sound like the fun police, but Im only suggesting they go in the right game thread/post game thread. I like the quote ""what I must do for you, I must do for all"" - if one user can post memes, everyone can post memes. Theres no rule currently about removing the odd image macro here and there, but what happens when theres 7 on the front page at the same time? Theres no rule against that either, which is my point.

I agree that the post today wasn't very good and my karma ate shit for it however the meme I'd say is appropriate within reason. I don't think everyone wants to see a plethora of memes after or during a game but that meme in particular was very relevant to current events and as you can see it got an overall positive reaction. In a sports sub that sees all of 6 posts per day it's not clogging things up drastically and we have a really cool voting system that helps weed out 'shit posts'."

Torontobluejays,3d1rmu,GRiZZY19,-1,Mon Jul 13 17:17:34 2015 UTC,Haha this is cute. I guess I left it open to your interpretation by not explicitly stating that I don't think it should be a total free for all. The point of the voting system is to weed out bad posts. It works pretty well. Once in a while mods need to step in if things get way off course but one of the great things about reddit is that you generally have the freedom to post whatever you think is good content and it can get voted on. If you look at my history you'll see I rarely ever post garbage so I'm clearly not trying to degrade the content. But good job stereotyping me. :)

Also, if we had won, the results in that post would have been way different.  I noticed some of the fans in here get REALLY down on the team and this sub, and anything light-hearted that gets posted, when the team is playing badly.  It's as if the small band of fun police get riled up when people still try to maintain an air of hope and fun in the face of losing.  It's baseball, there are ups and downs.  Personally, I prefer to keep my head up during the downs, so I don't mind when others try to as well.  Good luck, and have fun :)"

Torontobluejays,3d1yob,Born_Ruff,4,Sun Jul 12 23:26:54 2015 UTC,"Jose is definitely too blame. There is no reason to chirp the ump. Literally no good can come of it, and getting tossed is basically the only possible outcome, and its certainly not going to help you."
Torontobluejays,3d1yob,kapacj,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:07:35 2015 UTC,"It sounds like Bautista wasn't even arguing balls and strikes - after the game he said he was arguing that Davis wasn't coming set before his delivery to prevent Reyes from stealing, and was thus balking."
Torontobluejays,3d1yob,darrrrrren,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:03:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, I just read that, too. I'm very confused though. Here's a video:  http://mediadownloads.mlb.com/mlbam/2015/07/12/mlbtv_torkca_255854383_1200K.mp4  The ump seems to throw Bautista out after he finishes arguing."
Torontobluejays,3d1yob,chmcarro,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:54:19 2015 UTC,And in that video Davis definitely comes set.  Who knows.
Torontobluejays,3d1yob,darrrrrren,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:17:01 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. I missed that. It looks like the ump still gave him a warning but it really changes the context. Saying something like ""watch out for the balk I mentioned"" is very different than continuing to argue a past strike call. I can see why the ump would feel diminished but it's his job to be objective regardless of his personal feelings."
Torontobluejays,3d1yob,_Putin_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:48:26 2015 UTC,"He's a whiner.  Almost as big a whiner as Kyle Lowry on the Raptors.

Torontobluejays,3d1yob,ferdegrofe,17,Mon Jul 13 04:18:47 2015 UTC,"Best offence in the game can't win with defence and pitching that are hot garbage. I think this season, more than any other, solidifies that.  You could even argue that we didn't eve really have great offence since we scored so many runs over errors.   Is anyone else having the usual impending feeling of doom?  Right about now, the jays typically have a slow slide into mediocrity for the rest of the year.  I think we started sliding about a week ago."
Torontobluejays,3d1yob,nanobot001,5,Sun Jul 12 21:46:24 2015 UTC,"Yup.. the only difference this year is if we get a shot in the arm before the trade deadline. If we don't, I think a repeat of the last couple years is probable.  Even if we do, who knows what will happen. Should make things more interesting at least."
Torontobluejays,3d1yob,speg,4,Sun Jul 12 22:15:10 2015 UTC,"Is anyone else having the usual impending feeling of doom? >Right about now, the jays typically have a slow slide into mediocrity for the rest of the year. I think we started sliding about a week ago.   I tried telling people that like a week ago, and everyone was getting pretty mad, calling me an idiot and such. I've only been through this like 10 years, but I know the routine by now.   Someone brought up the actual track record in one thread, it said the Jays had less than 50% winrate in 18 of the last 20 seasons for July/August. It's the curse man. I bet the players legit believe something like that, knowing they always fail this time of year, then it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy."
Torontobluejays,3d1yob,RarelyReadReplies,5,Sun Jul 12 23:26:02 2015 UTC,"Great game, too many errors on our side. Hopefully a week off to get some rest will do us some good."
Torontobluejays,3d1yob,dasfeiz,6,Sun Jul 12 21:40:00 2015 UTC,"I'm upset that we lost, but it wasn't ours to win in the first place. Most teams don't come back when put in a 6-run deficit in the first. And yet this is the umpteenth time that we've seen the Jays pull it back close."
Torontobluejays,3d1yob,Garamor,5,Sun Jul 12 21:42:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly. To be mad after todays game would be silly. We played our hearts out and as you said not every team can score 8 runs in an inning to make a comeback. This reminded me of the Red Sox game back in June. Tighten up the defence and we actually have a decent shot at postseason. Hopefully Jose can make a return to the outfield and we can use Cola off the bench or in DH or at 1st if we need him and Im hoping Reyes lights a fire under his ass this second half. All in all, very Blue Jaysy way to round out the second half and though were not .500 were playing decent baseball and if theres anything this game could teach us its that literally anything can happen in this game so a few games back in mid July doesnt mean shit. Lets go Blue Jays"
Torontobluejays,3d1yob,dasfeiz,6,Sun Jul 12 21:46:02 2015 UTC,Both of us looked like a Benny hill skit at times. Good job sitting through that shit show.

Torontobluejays,3d0oth,neverruntwice,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:21:31 2015 UTC,Yeah what happened?
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,hogsalmon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:21:30 2015 UTC,"Pitch #2 was above the waist, and this guy's had a narrow strike zone all day. Gets frustrating to batters when all of the sudden balls become strikes.  Still, Joey needs to learn to keep his mouth shut."
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,sneaker98,7,Sun Jul 12 21:21:12 2015 UTC,One of these days MLB has to reign these guys in. Umps have too much power.
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,SteroyJenkins,4,Sun Jul 12 21:25:33 2015 UTC,Robot umps with infrared strike zone.
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,brownmagician,9,Sun Jul 12 21:19:52 2015 UTC,Finally Zaun got something right. The umpire definitely pushed the situation further.
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,l_VegaBond_l,2,Sun Jul 12 21:20:55 2015 UTC,Pretty hard to get thrown out if you just stay in the box and keep your mouth shut...

Torontobluejays,3d0oth,brownmagician,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:22:40 2015 UTC,Meals would strike out Ant Man at bat today without him swinging

Torontobluejays,3d0oth,FansTurnOnYou,2,Sun Jul 12 21:20:32 2015 UTC,"Vaun actually makes sense right now. Meals was completely in the wrong, overdramatic cunt"
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,schlaBAM,3,Sun Jul 12 21:18:26 2015 UTC,"I'm sure the ump was telling him ""that's enough, let's go"". He let him jaw him a bit, but Jose didn't hold up. That's on Jose, not the ump."
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,kapacj,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:18:24 2015 UTC,I think that's what happened but i agree with zaun.  Just let Jose talk and get behind the catcher
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,cookiemountain18,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:20:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Meals approached him aggravating the situation. That's not on Jose. You used to be able to jaw at umps forever and not get tossed, but today umps just want to do the motion."
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,schlaBAM,3,Sun Jul 12 22:13:12 2015 UTC,"I didnt see Meals approach him, and if he did I'm sure it was to tell him to shut up and get in the box, which Jose should have been doing anyways. In any sport, players need to realize that the officials/umps/refs are the ones in charge and learn to shut up."
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,kapacj,2,Sun Jul 12 21:22:32 2015 UTC,Exactly. All these umps are soft as fuck I swear to god.

Torontobluejays,3d0oth,Dolens,2,Sun Jul 12 21:18:02 2015 UTC,Theoretical question. Would there ever be a time you would have a player thrown out on purpose to get the next batter up?
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,dyoshun,2,Sun Jul 12 21:19:54 2015 UTC,Doesn't work that way.  The player that would have to come in for the ejected player would inherit the count.
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,fairfieldbordercolli,2,Sun Jul 12 21:17:47 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine why you'd do that, as you could just pinch hit instead."
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,Brizzyce,2,Sun Jul 12 21:18:54 2015 UTC,Would be pretty funny to see a batter come up and immediately start talking shit to an ump knowing he was going to be pinch hit for anyway.
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,neverruntwice,2,Sun Jul 12 21:18:51 2015 UTC,What? The next batter doesn't come up. You need to put in a pinch hitter.
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,McGrevin,3,Sun Jul 12 21:20:51 2015 UTC,It's great that Jose is fiery but he needs to get his temper in check.
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,jamesadiah,4,Sun Jul 12 21:18:44 2015 UTC,"This is the first time he's been thrown out all season. Considering what we saw in the years before last year, I'd say he's definitely a lot more tame and controlled."
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,Garamor,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:17:47 2015 UTC,"It's definitely getting better. But as much fun as it is to occasionally see Angry Jose jack one, I think it's more often the case that when he gets angry he makes bad decisions and swings at bad pitches. My frustration on this one was largely that he did it in a big moment."
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,jamesadiah,4,Sun Jul 12 21:21:12 2015 UTC,Bautista needs to learn how to keep his mouth shut in these high leverage situations. Leaders don't jeopardize their team to put on a show.
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,glausfan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:22:46 2015 UTC,was jose even talking when he got back into the box? or did the ump's feelings got hurt when jose just ignored him.
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,Jacked_Veiny_Balls,2,Sun Jul 12 21:17:45 2015 UTC,he was jawing him
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,kapacj,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:17:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah he kept talking. I agree with Zaun though.. the ump taking his mask off in confrontation was definitely ""throwing gas on the fire"". Do your job ump."
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,sroberts12,3,Sun Jul 12 21:21:19 2015 UTC,"Yes he was. The ump made the call, Jose started talking, the ump talked back, Jose kept talking, the ump turned to get a ball from the ball boy, Jose kept talking, and as the ump was getting ready to set into position and Jose was back in the batters box, Jose kept talking."
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,twistedlogicx,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:20:26 2015 UTC,they should give jose one of these

But as much as I love Bautista, the guy needs to learn to SHUT THE FUCK UP. Complain about it after the game. If you think the ump is costing you and the team in any way, it makes no sense to cost the team further by getting ejected."
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,twistedlogicx,7,Sun Jul 12 21:17:30 2015 UTC,Holy shit these fucking umps are like little dictators this year. They're angry about instant replay so they are super fucking defensive about the only calls that they have left to fuck up on with no repercussions.
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,Flerpinator,2,Sun Jul 12 21:17:28 2015 UTC,It was Bautista's fault he got tossed
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,kapacj,8,Sun Jul 12 21:17:24 2015 UTC,"Bautista, it was a tough call, but not that bad. You need to check your ego in a game breaking situation like that."
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,EndsLikeShakespeare,3,Sun Jul 12 21:21:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry guys, but I might be with the ump on this one. Bautista should have just kept his fucking mouth shut and been a ""leader"" of the team and just played through it. Instead our best RFer has now been ejected and one of our better bats.  Give me a fucking break. There's a time to argue and times not to. This was not a time to argue."
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,TLKv3,2,Sun Jul 12 21:17:20 2015 UTC,"With the amount of bad calls he takes that change the make up of a game completely, if he didn't get fired up I'd be worried. Zaun is right, the ump should have just been a man and ignored him and the game would have went on no problem."
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,stillnothingon,2,Sun Jul 12 21:17:16 2015 UTC,There's a time to toss a guy too. Ump was too hot on the trigger.
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,HW_Plainview,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:19:56 2015 UTC,Bautista knows Umps hate him. He should KNOW that by now. Stop arguing when a team who is craving a playoff run and has the potential to do it needs the fucking win going into the break. Act like the fucking leader you think you are.  Its a joke. He's done this too many times.
Torontobluejays,3d0oth,TLKv3,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:19:03 2015 UTC,Bautista rightly called out homie for sucking. If meals wants to toss him he can do it after the ab.

Torontobluejays,3d0oth,teckhz,-1,Sun Jul 12 21:21:59 2015 UTC,I don't care. Act like a fucking leader. The team NEEDS this win. This would give them so much going into the break.  And you argue calls in a tie game. Against one of the best teams. Fuck off.

Torontobluejays,3d0oth,brownmagician,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:10:44 2015 UTC,Well he has also made a couple nice plays defensively along with 3 hits today so you could call it a push

Do you think I'm psychic or something? No, I'm not psychic. I just know baseball. And I know that he is not an MLB-level shortstop. Not even close.  He's a disease that needs to be eradicated.  Unfortunately, as someone just mentioned in another comment to me, benching him and playing Goins at SS is probably a terrible move simply based on the fact that if there is any GM stupid enough to trade for him, any value Reyes has would be gone during the benching.  So let's keep him in the line-up and just hope somebody scoops him up in some awful, Vernon Wells-like trade.  But don't expect to be in contention on August 1st."

Torontobluejays,3d48yb,cozeners,2,Mon Jul 13 15:25:52 2015 UTC,"We're not making the playoffs without 2 SP upgrades and a LF whether that's Saunders or someone else. We have the worst defensive LF in baseball and the only position he provides value is DH.  We have two starters who have made 10+ starts who have been worth in the negatives as far as WAR goes (Dickey and Sanchez). Our bullpen has turned it around, they're doing very well. But if you think that Reyes is the issue with the team you need to be looking elsewhere first."

I can't say I'd close the books on Reyes... but let's not brush it off completely. His offense is downard trending very reasonably.  His ISO had remained steady the last 900 PA's, and his plate discipline has eroded. He's swinging more often, being challenged more often, and whiffing more often. It's not dramatic, but it's kind of expected from a 32 year old. There's nothing that jumps out and says that Reyes is a victim of bad luck.  bWAR has him at 0.4 so far: fWAR at 1.4. If you look at his last four year years of DRS/UZR data, and your own skepticism of single year metric values, than the bWAR is more reasonable.  There is a good chance that he's only a 1 Win shortstop going forward. All the markers for decline are there, and his last 900 or so PA's don't paint a very nice picture for a 32 YO shortstop who fields very poorly and is reliant on legs. At $22 million or so.  He's not the problem. But he very well could be going forward. I don't think that is unreasonable?"
Torontobluejays,3d48yb,Snidernomore,2,Mon Jul 13 18:13:23 2015 UTC,"Have you read cozeners other comments in this thread? The guy is on a witch hunt.

The problems you're pointing at are based on John Gibbons' complete inability to manage a bullpen, and the fact that there have been some sub-par performances. But I don't blame the bullpen pitchers for pitching poorly when they have no idea what their roles are. 2 or 3 weeks ago Steve Delabar was supposed to be taking over as setup man and sometimes closer. And what does Gibbons do? He puts Delabar in the game in the 6th inning. How is that a ""setup man""? Of course, Delabar doesn't have to pitch like crap in the 6th inning, but I can't understand why he would use him in that situation. It's idiotic. And Gibbons has been making these boneheaded bullpen moves all season long.  So no, Jose Reyes is not the sole reason. He's just adding to the many repairable problems on this club."

Torontobluejays,3d48yb,Royal_Flush13,0,Mon Jul 13 14:26:04 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately there are. Reyes can't play Shortstop (Goins is worth about 2 more wins/year with his glove) and he's not a good-enough hitter to play at any other position. He's not good enough to displace any of our 9 other starters. He's the 10th-best hitter and he has Colabello defence.  If he was Hanley, we'd put him at DH and be done with it, but he's not nearly as good a hitter.  In his entire career Reyes only had one really good offensive season (2011). Since then, he's been valuable as a slightly-above average hitter who can play shortstop. Except every year his defense and his hitting has declined. Last year he was a league-average hitter. And this year he's 10% worse than last year. And the glove is gross."
Torontobluejays,3d48yb,ExplainsSocialEnigma,2,Mon Jul 13 15:05:49 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately there are.   No, there really aren't.   he's not a good-enough hitter to play at any other position.   Yes, he is.   he has Colabello defence.   No, he doesn't. He's a SS. A below average one, but a SS none the less. If you put Bello at SS you would see that Reyes is the superior defender.   And this year he's 10% worse than last year.    A large chunk of that is early in the season when he was battling an injury he should have been DL'd for. He's been solid as of late with the bat. Certainly enough to make up for his D when you compare him to Ryan fucking Goins.   he's been valuable as a slightly-above average hitter who can play shortstop   Which is exactly what any rational person would still expect him to be for the remainder of this season.  Basically - Ryan Goins isn't good enough to take Jose Reyes' job and no one else can handle SS adequately enough to push Reyes out of the lineup. Jose's D does leave something to be desired at short, but he's not killing the team.  Derek Jeter put up a 75 OPS+ last year with his notoriously terrible defense and still managed a 0.2 bWAR. Reyes' should be about league average offensively, and I seriously doubt his D is worse than 40-year old Captain Clutch. The only thing I would advocate regarding Reyes is to move him in to the bottom third of the order, and maybe give him some rest a few times per month to keep him fresh."
Torontobluejays,3d48yb,Royal_Flush13,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:19:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, he is.   What other position can he play? There are zero positions on the team where a better option isn't already there. He's a below-average hitter who's projected to be about a league-average hitter in the middle of the best lineup in baseball. He can't play anywhere else on the Blue Jays except as a backup. Left-field is the only possible non-injury option.   A large chunk of that is early in the season when he was battling an injury he should have been DL'd for   1) He's always injured so that's not an exceptional circumstance. We should expect him to always be dealing with some sort of injury. 2) He clearly shouldn't have played and it was clearly his choice (""I can't bad left-handed, but don't worry I'll be fine"" wtf?) to hurt the team with his bad play instead of going on the DL immediately.   The only thing I would advocate regarding Reyes is to move him in to the bottom third of the order.   Agreed there. He's the worst hitter in the lineup most nights."
Torontobluejays,3d48yb,ExplainsSocialEnigma,2,Mon Jul 13 15:31:17 2015 UTC,"Considering that Collabello is probably the worst defensive LF in baseball that's a pretty easy one.  Reyes is our best option at SS at the moment. Goins has been worth -0.2 fWAR this season (-0.4 fWAR career) so he is literally worth less than a replacement player. Reyes isn't terrible, he's very overpaid and we made a terrible trade to acquire him but he is 1.6 fWAR better so far this season. Goins glove doesn't make up for how bad his bat is."
Torontobluejays,3d48yb,Ferivich,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:05:55 2015 UTC,"Goins has been worth -0.2 fWAR this season (-0.4 fWAR career) so he is literally worth less than a replacement player.    Well that's because he had to play half the time at 2B. He is below replacement when he plays 2B, but so is Reyes. At Short he has much more value: shortstop is inherently a harder and more valuable position, he's a better shortstop than he is a 2B, and strangely he actually hits better when he's playing Short. That last one is probably noise, although it's not unknown for players to hit poorly when they play out of position.  Anyway, Goins has provided more value per game while he's playing SS than Reyes has this season. When Goins played SS he hit with 99 wRC+ and was one of the best defensive shortstops in the majors. When Reyes plays SS he hits with 93 wRC+ but he's one of the worst defensive SS in the majors."

When Reyes plays SS he hits with 93 wRC+ but he's one of the worst defensive SS in the majors.   Finally someone on this thread with some common sense and an objective view of the stats. Sure, it's a very small sample size, but if you also consider that Goins' overall hitting production is up about 15% over last season, there's good reason to believe he's going to get a little better. The only area that Reyes certainly dominates Goins offensively is stolen bases, which is completely useless on this team."
Torontobluejays,3d48yb,cozeners,2,Mon Jul 13 20:44:07 2015 UTC,"What other position can he play?   Likely all of them, besides catcher, if he were given the time and practice to be transitioned. On this roster he doesn't fit in anywhere but SS, which is where he belongs anyway as the team does not have another adequate SS option, duh.   to hurt the team with his bad play instead of going on the DL immediately   That blame lies as much with the team's notoriously inept training staff and with management."
Torontobluejays,3d48yb,Royal_Flush13,0,Mon Jul 13 15:33:06 2015 UTC,"Our ""inadequate option"" has been more valuable than Reyes at SS this year. The only way Reyes could be the better option is if you think he, at 32, is still the player he once was."

Torontobluejays,3d48yb,ExplainsSocialEnigma,-1,Mon Jul 13 22:02:29 2015 UTC,"As right as you are, unfortunately, if AA has even a sliver of hope in trading him, benching him would only concede that he's either injured or has no value left.  I don't agree with benching him, just based on that fact alone. You just can't do that with a guy making that much money and then hope to trade him. So unfortunately, we're stuck with one of the worst SS's in the majors and just hope to see some kind of trade miracle.  I'm also assuming his money is guaranteed so we can't just release him, correct? Otherwise, I would do that in a heartbeat."
Torontobluejays,3d48yb,cozeners,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:29:21 2015 UTC,Yeah he's owed $59M guaranteed.

Torontobluejays,3d48yb,cozeners,2,Mon Jul 13 15:34:29 2015 UTC,"They should be putting Goins in defensively when they have lead or are close and can make a comeback late in games. There's very little that's more painful than watching Reyes make a mistake late in the ball game that costs them the game.  I believe if they have a small lead by the 7th, Reyes should come out. Goins should go in."
Torontobluejays,3d48yb,darth-helmet,4,Tue Jul 14 13:24:56 2015 UTC,"Pretty much to make your theory work on Goins he would need to make a play that Reyes couldn't every game, right now its about once a week. Reyes has made around 12 errors every year and is on pace for around the same this year, and still got big (back loaded) contract that sees him get 22 million, now I do not argue that he is not worth 22 million right now, and I believe that if he were put on waivers that nobody would pick him up because that is how a back loaded contract works. That being said just think for a second, If Goins was a starting caliber shortstop would't somebody want him in a trade? At the league minimum no less? The minors are full of guys that can play good defense but can't swing the bat, and Goins is in that category."

Travis beats Jeter almost everywhere through 52 games. And it's not a fluke. If you've watched his approach at the plate, you know he's going to have a great career. Sure, he might not keep all of it up as well as Jeter did, but don't forget that Jeter played on some incredible offensive clubs.

Smoak and Colabello have hit significantly better this year and project to continue to hit better than Reyes. Valencia's hit significantly better than Reyes though he projects to hit worse. And Pillar has hit better than Reyes though he projects to hit worse and I disagree with the projections: he's showing signs of legitimate improvement (walks are up, Ks are down, power is up, BABIP is very low for someone with his speed, his success is correlated to a swing change, etc.).  Martin projects better than all of them and he's hit better than Reyes."
Torontobluejays,3d48yb,ExplainsSocialEnigma,-4,Mon Jul 13 15:22:14 2015 UTC,"It's not just about batting average. Those other hitters either have patience (i.e. OBP over .320) or they have some power numbers (a decent OPS). Reyes has neither of those things. He's useless as a hitter, and (amazingly) even worse as a SS."
Torontobluejays,3d48yb,cozeners,6,Mon Jul 13 15:32:51 2015 UTC,He's useless as a hitter   Says the guy who wants Ryan Goins in the lineup.
Torontobluejays,3d48yb,Royal_Flush13,-3,Mon Jul 13 15:45:22 2015 UTC,It's not that I want Ryan Goins in the lineup. It's that I don't want Reyes in the lineup.  I don't care what Ryan Goins does at the plate. His defence alone is worth the trade off.
Torontobluejays,3d48yb,cozeners,5,Mon Jul 13 16:07:00 2015 UTC,"His defence alone is worth the trade off.   That's the thing though: it isn't. It is to you, but you seem to have a flawed understanding of how baseball players contribute to winning baseball games."
Torontobluejays,3d48yb,Royal_Flush13,0,Mon Jul 13 16:07:46 2015 UTC,"Jose Reyes will probably play every game for the rest of this season. When the Blue Jays are out of the play-off race in mid-August, that will be all the evidence I need to back up what I'm saying. In fact, they're already out of it, it's just that most Blue Jays fans are not objective enough to recognize that."
Torontobluejays,3d48yb,cozeners,5,Mon Jul 13 16:20:58 2015 UTC,You're trolling right? You have to be at this point. There's no way you're this fucking clueless about the team or baseball in general.
Torontobluejays,3d48yb,Royal_Flush13,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:23:27 2015 UTC,"I agree the argument for Reyes vs. Goins needs to at least be acknowledged, but by your account, the Jays will not make the playoffs due to the fact that Reyes is starting.  You can't confirm that Goins would be an improved replacement that keeps us in the hunt until you see it for an extended period of time.  just because option A doesn't work does not mean you head blindly for option B."
Torontobluejays,3d48yb,ChickenChipz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:21:48 2015 UTC,"Goins bat is 52% below league average, in his career he has been worth less than a replacement player. The argument could be made that Goins doesn't even have a roll on a major league roster because you can find someone that does what he does and provides more value."
Torontobluejays,3d48yb,Ferivich,-1,Mon Jul 13 17:10:02 2015 UTC,"Ryan Goins has played 169 games. That's roughly one season at the MLB level. I'd hardly call that a ""career"" worth drawing conclusions from.  EDIT: And don't forget, those 169 games include every single game that he comes in late as a pinch runner or defensive replacement.  Anyone who knows anything about baseball understands that Jose Reyes is one of the most fundamentally flawed athletes in the league. He is so awful in that area, it's not even worth arguing about. The only thing that keeps him in the lineup every day is the fact that he's getting paid so much money.  Ryan Goins' numbers this season are improved over last season and if you're paying close attention, you would have been able to recognize that his at-bats are much better. He's more patient at the plate and he makes contact more often. No he's not a better hitter than Reyes.  But considering Reyes is hitting in front of three of the best sluggers in MLB and has an OBP hovering barely around .300 and an OPS barely above .700, I would say that Ryan Goins' .600-ish OPS and .270 OBP doesn't sound all that bad. I would imagine, based on the fact that Goins has slowly improved, that, hitting in front of Donaldson and Bautista, he could eventually muster up .250/.320 and continue with his amazing defence and sound fundamentals. That would be much stronger to the team than what Reyes has provided."
Torontobluejays,3d48yb,cozeners,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:29:18 2015 UTC,"I'd hope his bat had improved on last year, it was 74% below league average. I agree that Reyes should not be hitting lead off, he doesn't walk and he's a free swinger. He should be hitting 7th or 9th.  I'm well aware that he's played 169 games. But he has played 6 seasons in the minors and you can safely draw conclusions from that sample size. He's a below average base runner, amongst the worst hitters in the league.  I was employed in baseball for three years, Reyes is an OK short stop, he's worth 2-2.5 wins a season. Goins has a great glove but his bat is so bad that his glove does not make up for it. He's like the reverse Chris Collabello who's bat is great this year (though it is subject to regression) but his defence is so bad it barely matters how well he's hitting.  It's not safe to assume that Goins bat would improve in the 1 slot hitting in front of the power threats. Protection is a myth that has not been proven and there's more research that shows that it doesn't actually exist. With more playing time his bat will play about where it is now."
Torontobluejays,3d48yb,Ferivich,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:41:29 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying, but everything you're saying is based on past numbers over a very small sample size at MLB level.  But even if we assume that his stats will be the same, then we also have to assume that there's a reason for his 15% improvement over last season. If a guy can figure out how to get 15% better over one year, then we can also safely assume he has the potential to get even better than that. No, he's not going to continue to improve by 15% every season, but he hasn't levelled off yet and he hasn't regressed so badly as to be sent down.  Again, I'm not saying Goins is the solution. Maybe he's not. I don't know, and neither do you based on 169 games, many of which have been 1-3 inning outings. But I can definitely say for certain that Reyes is not the solution and pretty much anyone is an improvement over his ridiculously boneheaded let's-steal-third-base-down-7-0 style of play."

Torontobluejays,3cy94d,disbeLEAF,14,Sat Jul 11 22:31:47 2015 UTC,"Chill,  if it didn't happen then it would have happened later.  It was previously sore and was an injury in the making."

Torontobluejays,3cy94d,UsersManual,2,Sun Jul 12 03:52:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, going yard is the professional vengeance, for sure. :) Goddamnit I love it!"
Torontobluejays,3cy94d,Beatle_Matt,0,Sun Jul 12 05:12:22 2015 UTC,Exactly!! I'm not saying we should trade him but what if there was a team with pieces we need who need a slugger to get in the playoffs? Hrmm bautista might be hurt better look elsewhere. It just ties our hands. Not to be hard on the guy though. It's great seeing him mash but also taking walks to set up Edwin. He's playing well.
Torontobluejays,3cy94d,2dfx,0,Sun Jul 12 06:01:22 2015 UTC,no player is perfect. its what makes sports sports. if he wasnt emotional maybe he'd be super shy and quiet like phil kessel. then we got an awkward leader who eats oreos instead taking care of his body with booster juice

Maybe Valencia?  But most likely the Padres would target Norris or Hoffman. We're really looking to build up on the farm that we lost this offseason."

Last offseason, when it would have cost them nothing but money, they didn't sign him. Why would they take him now?"
Torontobluejays,3cxzeu,gandalfsnutsack,2,Sun Jul 12 17:21:11 2015 UTC,"If they could get money off the books elsewhere, I could see AA doing it. A FA signing is a straight-out purchase. A trade can be net +/-."

Torontobluejays,3cxm40,GeeSpot007,-2,Sun Jul 12 04:25:05 2015 UTC,"Reyes can't take a walk to save his life either. Most leadoff hitters can't. It's very hard to walk from the leadoff spot because most pitchers pound the zone against fast, low-power leadoff hitters."
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,ExplainsSocialEnigma,3,Sun Jul 12 14:05:28 2015 UTC,"No, he can't, but I was comparing Pillar and Travis."
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,allirow,2,Sun Jul 12 15:15:00 2015 UTC,"What about Martin - never considered him really until now.  He hits for average, sees a lot of pitches, takes a lot of walks.  He doesn't have the speed but he's currently 3rd on our team in stolen bases! (very misleading)  Travis would be the ideal candidate, however I would not have him in lead off unless Reyes cannot play.  Travis needs to build up his confidence at the bottom of the line up."
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,sgt-pickles,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:19:22 2015 UTC,"I'd been advocating advocating for Martin to leadoff since before the season. But that was when I thought he was going to put up a 370 OBP.  Strange as it sounds, it actually looks like Bautista is probably the best option."
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,ExplainsSocialEnigma,2,Wed Jul 15 02:47:28 2015 UTC,In my perfect world :  Travis  Jose  Jd  Edwin   Smoak / Colabello  Saunders / Valencia   Martin  Reyes  Pillar
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,sheetneeded,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:06:57 2015 UTC,"If Reyes can get back to his career numbers of approx .350 OBP and close to .300 BA then he can stay at the top of the order. However, with an approx .300 OBP he has no business being at the top of the order. It's literally costing us runs when the heart of the order hit the ball. Give him a couple more weeks to see if he can turn it around, and if not swap him with Travis."
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,iferraro,2,Sat Jul 11 18:37:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's ever going to get back to those career norms.  Best we can hope for with him is continuing to avoid the 60 day DL, good baserunning, low K rates, and keeping his defense at around -5 UZR and not declining further, and his wRC+ around 90-100.  If he can do that, he should be good for 2-3 WAR per year till the end of his contract."
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,allirow,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:49:45 2015 UTC,"k, what? Haha. That's exactly the point, is that he isn't at his career norms otherwise it wouldn't be mentioned. I'd take a .320 OBP from him. Last year he had a .325 and decent."
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,zebra_heaDD,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:30:44 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you're talking about. I said if he can't turn it around within a couple weeks, then I would swap him with Travis. Based on his career numbers, his numbers should improve by regression to the mean. So, I would not make the swap just yet."
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,iferraro,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:36:09 2015 UTC,He won't bat .300/.350 again is the point.
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,zebra_heaDD,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:40:07 2015 UTC,"Woah, we got a Psychic over here"
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,WayneM70,0,Mon Jul 13 04:46:04 2015 UTC,It's not costing the Jays runs right now.  His OBP in July is .358.  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,thewolfshead,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:38:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting that. he has been turning it around in the last few games. That's why I'd still give him another couple weeks or so to see if he can improve his overall numbers. If we get into August and his on-base percentage is still close to .300, then he would have no business at the top of the order."
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,iferraro,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:45:48 2015 UTC,"If there was a better option, no. But there's no better option for the lead off spot except maybe Travis, but he struggled under the pressure of the 2 hole, so leave him down for now."
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,BlueJaysWatch,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:37:30 2015 UTC,We don't really have much better options right now in my opinion. If Reyes would stop with the one pitch outs then he should be adequate.
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,mcmadbat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:50:44 2015 UTC,Have Donaldson bat lead-off and have Martin bat second.
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,ArminscopyofSwank,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:58:32 2015 UTC,Donaldson in lead off makes no sense. He is our best bat. Our best bat should be number 2. He also isnt fast like Reyes where he could steal second and possibly third.
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,xzElmozx,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:39:29 2015 UTC,Leadoff should be one of best 3 bats. Donaldson isn't a terrible choice.  And what do you mean Donaldson isn't fast? He's the second-best baserunner on the team behind Pillar. Reyes is third because he gets thrown-out too much.
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:48:52 2015 UTC,"No. He's rarely been ideal as a leadoff hitter because his plate discipline, and thus OBP, have been poor. The years he's hit .300+, he's been serviceable. But right now several hitters would be a better option, namely Travis. Pillar is an OK option, as well as Colabello.   In essence, speed is only a valuable asset at the top if the guy gets on base. Reyes just isn't doing that. If he gets hot again, sure.   Of course, I'm a big supporter of keeping hot hitters in the top 4, to get them more ABs. Gibbons is more of a stick to his guns type manager. Both have their merits. Keep in mind that Gibby isn't an armchair manager, no matter how relaxed he looks. He's got huge egos to deal with."
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,toenailclipping,7,Sat Jul 11 20:12:28 2015 UTC,Pillar is a HORRIBLE option. The guy can't take a walk to save his life.
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,ExplainsSocialEnigma,2,Sat Jul 11 21:07:56 2015 UTC,Which is fine because leadoff hitters usually have the zone pounded on them anyway so even Barry Bonds can barely walk when leading off (Bonds was walked 20.3% of the time during his career but only ~14% of the time when leading of an inning. The guys you want batting leadoff are the guys who get on base while the zone is pounded. Usually that means singles.  Pillar and Reyes are actually very similar players but Pillar appears to be better.
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,jayk10,2,Sat Jul 11 22:31:56 2015 UTC,They have almost identical batting averages and obp. Reyes has 1 more stolen base in 80 less at bats and strikes out less  But regardless Travis should be given the chance to leadoff
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,ExplainsSocialEnigma,0,Sat Jul 11 22:59:30 2015 UTC,"They have almost identical everything offensively, Reyes walks just as infrequently as Pillar, Pillar has more power, Pillar is a better baserunner, and I trust that Pillar is improving while Reyes is declining."
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,jayk10,2,Sat Jul 11 23:10:50 2015 UTC,"Except that Pillar was on a Collabelllo like tear in June, while Reyes played hurt for 2 weeks. And you ignored their strikeout rates"
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,ExplainsSocialEnigma,-1,Sat Jul 11 23:25:30 2015 UTC,"Reyes is always dealing with an injury, you can't just exclude it, that's who he is. In fact, it's worrisome that he'd rather play terribly through a broken rib than sit and let Goins play.  Pillar is maintaining his tear into July. I have no idea why you'd discount recent results - if anything they are the most relevant  I ignored K rates because it doesn't really help your point. Ks are a proxy - Pillar is just as good or better in spite of the Ks - he has more power, better baserunning, and slightly better OBP and BB rates.  Also FWIW, Ks and BBs improve quickly among young hitters so if those are your chief concerns with Pillar, things are looking reasonably rosy."
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,gandalfsnutsack,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:47:31 2015 UTC,"I mentioned him because he's been very hot lately, essentially the same sort of hitter Reyes is when he's hot: speed, hits, almost no walks."
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,gandalfsnutsack,2,Sat Jul 11 21:12:32 2015 UTC,Pillar is an awful option. He just barely has a major league bat to hit in the 8 or 9 hole. His career walk rate of 4 percent means he should be as far away from lead off as possible.
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,gandalfsnutsack,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:22:45 2015 UTC,"In general, with a career perspective, I agree with you, but I also refer you to this post: https://i.imgur.com/uFOcjvj.png"
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,sgt-pickles,0,Sat Jul 11 22:35:10 2015 UTC,I hear you but I wouldn't make a change based on a small sample size when his career numbers show me clearly he can't take a walk to save his life. A better lead off strictly through OBP would be Jose Bautista but he won't bat outside of the 3-hole.
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:58:05 2015 UTC,I just mean it as go with the hot bat. I just believe in that as a strategy.
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,allirow,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:35:16 2015 UTC,That's cool. I wish Gibby played with the lineup a little more. I wouldn't mind seeing a revamp for a couple of games.
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:37:08 2015 UTC,"For lack of a better option I would say yes Reyes should be lead off. Perhaps when Travis gains more experience he would be a good candidate, but I would leave him hit lower in the order while Reyes is healthy"
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,allirow,-10,Sat Jul 11 18:14:54 2015 UTC,"Literally anybody except Goins, Navarro, or Carrera would be a better option. Reyes is the 9th-best hitter on the team after Donaldson, Bautista, Encarnacion, Martin, Smoak, Colabello, Valencia, and Travis. Even Pillar and Carrera are hitting better than Reyes."
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:52:12 2015 UTC,"Not entirely fair when the Jays have 8 hitters with wRC+ of 115 or higher, but no, he should be moved out of leadoff for next season."
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,allirow,-6,Sat Jul 11 21:23:19 2015 UTC,"I was actually being generous. Pillar is also hitting better than Reyes and Carrera was hitting better before today. And even if you believe that Reyes will bounce back and return to 2013 form, he'd still be the 9th-best hitter on the team.  But even then, lineups are constructed contextually given the batters you have. There are lots of lineups in baseball where Reyes would make a fine leadoff hitter. The Blue Jays are not one of them because they're too good. 90 wRC+ or even 110 wRC+ is not good enough to bat leadoff in this lineup.  Reyes hasn't been good enough to hit leadoff in a lineup this strong since 2011."
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,ExplainsSocialEnigma,2,Sat Jul 11 21:41:58 2015 UTC,"He's at least the 6th best player on the team, via WAR, but they should definitely reconsider the leadoff position next year.  They won't make any changes this year, I'd be shocked if they did."
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,walkerlucas,-6,Sat Jul 11 21:49:27 2015 UTC,"Mark Buerhle is the 6th-best player by bWAR but I wouldn't bat him leadoff either.  When we're talking lineup order, raw hitting (and running) are the only things you need to consider and you can kind of put WAR aside for a moment because the glove side of the game doesn't matter there. Reyes' value comes from being a very good hitter for a shortstop. That doesn't mean he's a better hitter than less-valuable players like Colabello (and this is even without buying into any Colabello hype - Colabello is projected to be a better hitter than Reyes going forward)  So it doesn't surprise that Reyes is simultaneously the 6th-most valuable player (or thereabouts) and also the 9th-best hitter."
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,allirow,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:56:38 2015 UTC,I didn't think I had to specify position player when we were talking about batters.
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,ExplainsSocialEnigma,-2,Sat Jul 11 21:57:45 2015 UTC,"I think I had to point out the flaw of using WAR, a cumulative stat that includes defensive value, when we're talking about offensive ability/performance"
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,AndrewEscobar44,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:01:38 2015 UTC,Were paying 22M a year for 3 more years to the 9th best hitter on the team.
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,ExplainsSocialEnigma,3,Sat Jul 11 21:03:15 2015 UTC,2 more years after this one.  He has an option for a 3rd year.
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,AndrewEscobar44,0,Sat Jul 11 21:22:27 2015 UTC,Which in itself is fine when that player is a shortstop on an offensively-stacked team. The problem is when that player bats leadoff.  A defensively-average shortstop with a league-average bat would cost at least that much anyway.
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,ExplainsSocialEnigma,0,Sat Jul 11 22:34:02 2015 UTC,"Such a dumb statement, first of all he is not our 9th best hitter he is higher than that and also the contract was back-loaded, you didnt see people complaining when he was making significantly less in this contract.  You will probably also be complaining when martin is 37 and making 20 million a year, but loving him now while he is only making 7"
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,AndrewEscobar44,0,Sun Jul 12 16:51:32 2015 UTC,"He's 10th-best by performance and 7th-best by projection.  This isn't a matter of opinion, he's not a great hitter and he is a very inappropriate leadoff hitter on this team."
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,ExplainsSocialEnigma,0,Wed Jul 15 02:54:59 2015 UTC,"Ok well i don't know what you are using to calculate who the best hitters are, wrc+? I factor in other things like that he played three weeks with a bad rib injury that limited him to hitting from one side, right, which is his worse side. I also am talking about past performances/ track record because there is a pretty small sample size with Reyes because he was hurt this year. To say he is a very inappropriate leadoff hitter on this team is being melodramatic because realistically devon travis would be your only other option, then reyes would be the next choice."
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,TLKv3,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:55:05 2015 UTC,That's why I mentioned projections.   He'd still be 9th best if he performed like last year. He'd be 7th  best if he performed like 2013. This lineup is simply too good for a slightly above-average hitter to bat leadoff.  Reyes hasn't been good enough since 2011 to lead off.
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,xzElmozx,2,Wed Jul 15 19:48:54 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I know that he is not really a great leadoff hitter because of his low walk/obp ratios, but like i said travis is really the only other option and even he has a high babip so his average is probably not this sustainable, but he does walk more. Pillar is really identical to reyes so i just give jose the edge because of his base stealing ability"
Torontobluejays,3cxm40,TLKv3,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:58:56 2015 UTC,"but like i said travis is really the only other option   Well there are easily 6 better options than Reyes so in terms of upgrades there are a lot more options than Travis. Martin, Bautista, Colabello, Smoak, Donaldson, or Encarnacion would all be better choices than Reyes. Pillar is about a wash.  That's not to say that all those guys are ideal leadoff hitters, but rather to highlight how bad Reyes fits in as a leadoff hitter.  The leadoff hitter needs to be one of your 3 most productive hitters."

I'm now of the opinion they should trade their own big names to get replacements/prospects for next year. With all the big name free agent pitchers and money coming off the books? The Jays can easily rebuild their rotation if Rogers gives AA the ok to finally spend some money to get them.  Let's say AA signs 2 pitchers. That would replace Dickey & Buerhle (although I want Buerhle for one more year). We'd also have back Stroman and Sanchez. Best outcome happens, we have Hutch & Norris bounce back with great pitching again. That would be 6 starters available for the Jays to use next year. Throw one into the bullpen and the pen looks stronger.  I know I always have the unpopular opinions and we should still be hopeful the Jays can go on another crazy winning streak and still make it into the playoffs. But from what I've seen the past week or two? This team has exhausted itself. And if AA doesn't make a trade? We'll be right back to where we were last year.

Torontobluejays,3cwi1s,thebrokendoctor,2,Sat Jul 11 16:41:21 2015 UTC,"They gave them to ok to trade for a $20 million contract in Buerhle, why wouldn't they get the ok to do the same in free agency?"
Torontobluejays,3cwi1s,treilly19,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:02:16 2015 UTC,Depends on who they target. The five year policy will limit who they can sign and they might only be able to go after mid level pitching.
Torontobluejays,3cwi1s,tvismyfriend,-1,Sat Jul 11 20:06:53 2015 UTC,"Time to ship out EE and J-Bau for pitching prospects? Wouldn't be popular, but what is the point in keeping these guys if we don't have the arms to win this year or next."
Torontobluejays,3cwi1s,BellevilleBob,-1,Sat Jul 11 19:39:51 2015 UTC,Come September if we're 6-8 games back (I think we honestly will be) I say trade them for younger bats who are consistently solid. Replace the bats rather than the pitching. Pitching FAs are going to be out there to be freely signed plus our bright spot young prospect pitchers.
Torontobluejays,3cwi1s,TLKv3,0,Sat Jul 11 20:10:32 2015 UTC,In September they wouldn't be eligible for the playoffs and that might hurt the return the Blue Jays could possibly get. If you're going to wait that long it's better to pick uo their options and do it in the offseason.
Torontobluejays,3cwi1s,tvismyfriend,0,Sat Jul 11 20:20:58 2015 UTC,They could get a lot more for them now though.
Torontobluejays,3cwi1s,BellevilleBob,-5,Sat Jul 11 21:01:19 2015 UTC,Can't just blame pitching last 2 games they got shutout. Gibbons has to go or it doesn't matter who they acquire for the bullpen/rotation.
Torontobluejays,3cwi1s,Billabob69,-4,Sat Jul 11 17:37:55 2015 UTC,Agreed. Since May we've only lost four games when we scored 4 runs or more.  Almost all the games we're losing is because of poor offence moreso than poor defence. The holes in LF and SS are more glaring than the hole in the rotation.

We put up 6 runs against the sox, okay we can blame our pitching for that. Then we hold to sox to 2 runs but put up 0. Then we hold to royals to 3 and put up 0. What about that doesnt scream inconsistent to you? How about scoring 11 then 6 then 6 then just 3? The 3 was obviously the pitchings fault too. Or maybe beating the tigers 10-5 then coming back out and putting up 2?  The bats are inconsistent and almost as much a problem as the bullpen/starting rotation.

Torontobluejays,3cvv1f,91Caleb,4,Sat Jul 11 21:51:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this feels like a magical season. I know that usually, you associate the word ""magic"" in baseball to something like what the Cardinals are doing this year, maybe even what the Astros are doing, and it's probably ridiculous that I'm making this post after back-to-back shut out losses. But I just feel like this is the year, and that all of these struggles right now will only be a footnote at the end of the season.   A month or two ago, I told people that the slow start to the season had me more optimistic this year than years where the team started off strong, because it felt realistic. It didn't feel like a team playing over their heads, it felt like a team due for a break-out. Not long after that, the Jays came back from an 8-1 deficit against the Red Sox and fired off 11 games in a row.   Now I know these recent struggles suck and they're hard to stomach and hard to sit through, and a lot of people probably think this is a back-to-reality wake-up call. But the one great thing about this (atleast so far) is that the team is still hovering around .500, despite all of the bad that has happened. Maybe this post makes me look like an ass a few weeks from now, when the Jays are buried deep in the cellar, but I just feel like this offense can't be held down for much longer. That when they break out again, it'll push the team far above .500, where they'll stay for the rest of the season. I'm optimistic that the front office will get something done, and the pitching will improve.   When Joe Carter took Mitch Williams deep to left field and created the greatest moment in the history of Toronto sports, I was in a crib. I've never watched this team win anything meaningful. Maybe that should make me a jaded cynic, but for some reason, I just don't feel that this year. This year feels different.   This feels like the year where the Blue Jays rise from the ashes of a miserable start to the season. Where Josh Donaldson comes to Toronto to win an MVP in his first year with the club. Where Alex Anthopoulos finally makes the rejuvenating move to save the team that fans have been yearning for at every trade deadline for years. This feels like the year where Marcus Stroman makes a miraculous late-season comeback to give a push to an already rolling steamroller, shouldered by a juggernaut offense that this city hasn't seen since the glory days of WAMCO.  Should I be more grounded in reality? Maybe. Am I being delusional? Probably. But after two decades of hopelessness and mediocrity, I'm tired of looking at this team and feeling disappointed. I want just once to make a slew of ridiculously optimistic Cinderella predictions, and see them all pan out.  I don't expect that anyone read this post, and that's fine. I made this post for me. So that no matter how good or how bad or how in-between the rest of this season goes, I can look back and know that I stood by a team right at its breaking point. I know that the odds are always against this team, and nobody other than the most irrational of us expects this team to get anywhere. But this is the year.  It has to be."
Torontobluejays,3cvv1f,twistedlogicx,3,Sat Jul 11 09:23:53 2015 UTC,"I like your optimism.  That is what a real fan feels.  If one's only view is negative, then why bother watching at all?  Only one team can win a game.  A few losses are part of the landscape, but that doesn't mean it's over - especially this early in the season.  Adversity brings out the best in humans, and our Jays will gather their talent for the second half and make an entertaining run."

He was saying that he doesn't think the team is one starter + one reliever away from fielding a legitimate World Series contending lineup.  Therefore, to ship out some blue chip prospects for Cueto/Samardzija/anybody else who is a free agent next year makes no sense - the team isn't good enough anyway.  He might have a point too.  The rotation is more than one rental ace away from being decent.  Other than Buerhle who can we count on to give a solid performance every 5 days?  The amazing offense covers up some of that but as we've seen recently even these bats can't overcome crappy pitching night after night after night."

Do you think their fans would rather go back to '04? When they had all those picks and 'just wait' 'just wait'? Absolutely not.   The Brewers in '08 were also celebrated for getting Sabathia and making the playoffs, and then again they went all in for 2011 knowing full well they probably weren't keeping Fielder and they had a good run.  Those franchises are relevant again.   This whole argument that the Jays aren't good enough to win a World Series is moronic because playoffs in sports are such a crapshoot.

Torontobluejays,3cu79e,cookiemountain18,2,Fri Jul 10 22:02:44 2015 UTC,I really doubt McCown said that. From everything I've heard he's all for trading for a rental.
Torontobluejays,3cu79e,ExplainsSocialEnigma,4,Fri Jul 10 20:47:54 2015 UTC,"I just listened to him. He just finished saying how ""you're never as good as you are when winning and never as bad as when you're losing."" and then immediately goes into a 'sky is falling' rant."

Torontobluejays,3cu79e,5pear,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:31:03 2015 UTC,What jays podcasts do you listen to?
Torontobluejays,3cu79e,Royal_Flush13,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:54:13 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but here are my two cents. Birds All Day is okay, but I haven't really been enjoying it as much as Drunk Jays Fans when it was still going. I usually listen to the podcast edition of Jays Talk on my commute to work which is good entertainment. There's also a pretty good podcast that covers the Jays minor league system called Around the Nest."

Torontobluejays,3cu79e,ilikefarting,0,Fri Jul 10 22:07:17 2015 UTC,He's not 100% wrong. If the jays are as bad as they currently are playing then getting renters are a bad idea. But if this is just a bad stretch then let's go for it.
Torontobluejays,3cu79e,sammeggs,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:13:23 2015 UTC,Don't forget that Bob is brilliant at what he does which is to say things that get listeners fired up. It's well documented that he puts on a persona on the air because it leads to much better ratings. I get pissed at him too but then I remember that is the beauty of what he does. I don't want to listen to a guy who just says the same shit I would say.
Torontobluejays,3cu79e,ajn19,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:53:42 2015 UTC,"Bob doesn't believe the jays are a 'Cueto + papelbon' away from being certain division champs.. and therefore doesn't want to give up potential top 2 rotation talent to get it.. he cites the As last season as a team that did exactly that giving up Cespedes + for Lester and Samardzija and then they flopped.  The jays high potential pitching is great and likely will lead to a very solid rotation in 3-4 years, while guys like Martin, Donaldson, Pillar + will still be around  not to mention next year 30 mil of the books of buehrle and dickey to really spend where we need  --this was Bob's take"
Torontobluejays,3cu79e,WayneM70,0,Sat Jul 11 00:43:49 2015 UTC,"The issue is ownership and budget constraints. AA and Beeston constantly say ""the money is there"" when needed. But they were clearly tied in the past couple offseasons to make a big move (Martin's contract was backloaded). Remember the Ervin Santana report about current Jays taking a hit on their salary to accommodate him? I realize he had his suspension and in hindsight it wouldn't have been a good signing. But what drives me nuts is AA and Beeston defending ownership, if Rogers wanted to win they could boost that budget $10-$20M more."
Torontobluejays,3cu79e,sammeggs,2,Fri Jul 10 21:39:59 2015 UTC,"Eh, man. Statue of an owner who was around for 2.5 years outside the Dome."
Torontobluejays,3cu79e,Brizzyce,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:47:42 2015 UTC,"This is why MLB prefers private to corporate owners. Rogers doesn't own a baseball team with the goal of winning to turn a profit. They own a baseball team with the sole purpose of keeping them in the black financially without taking on any ""unnecessary"" risk."
Torontobluejays,3cu79e,poopsmith666,0,Sat Jul 11 03:08:58 2015 UTC,"I kinda agree with what Zahn has said about this.  Selling the farm for an ace only makes sense if that's the one thing on your team keeping you down.  But the Jays have got a lot of warts, outfield defence and offensive consistency for starters.  Yeah you have pitching woes but what does it matter when you're getting effectively shut out one of every 3 to 4 games?"
Torontobluejays,3cu79e,Ferivich,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:31:07 2015 UTC,I'd agree with that in the sense that it's best to build a team from the top down. The last pieces of the puzzle are ideally role-playing bench veterans who have played in a WS before and can motivate the younger elites.
Torontobluejays,3ctxgu,4and1punt,6,Fri Jul 10 19:17:03 2015 UTC,"Belleville! Dundas and Pinnacle, if I remember correctly?"

Torontobluejays,3ctxgu,IoloFitzOwen,6,Fri Jul 10 23:58:36 2015 UTC,"I think it's a U-Brew place, not a brewery.  That said, Barley Days isn't too far from Belleville, and they make good stuff."
Torontobluejays,3ctxgu,Canadave,3,Sat Jul 11 00:21:46 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'll look them up.
Torontobluejays,3ctxgu,IoloFitzOwen,2,Sat Jul 11 00:34:38 2015 UTC,"Barley Days is in my hometown, or at least close enough to it. It actually just got sold to the owners of the County Cider Company in Waupoos. They are upgrading the building too."

Torontobluejays,3cucff,SteroyJenkins,-4,Sat Jul 11 03:22:52 2015 UTC,"I can't believe how many people on this Reddit sub support Jose Reyes and his awful style of baseball. It's unbelievable what people see in him.  He's the lead-off hitter and his OBP is currently .299.  His OPS is .677.  What exactly is he contributing to this team right now besides a flashy haircut and a fancy HR dance? Seriously, what is this bizarre love people have for his ""aggressive game"" that fails far too many times? Why is it that Toronto baseball fans don't understand what makes a player a good player?"
Torontobluejays,3cucff,cozeners,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:22:00 2015 UTC,"He's the best option at SS for the Blue Jays. Until someone better comes along, what's the point in constantly complaining? Yes, his defense is poor and his contract is brutal but he's still the best SS in the entire organization with no one else even close to the Majors. He's not going anywhere."
Torontobluejays,3cucff,Qwyjibo_,2,Sat Jul 11 03:36:19 2015 UTC,Reyes is still easily a top 10 shortstop and arguably top 5
Torontobluejays,3cucff,Bringer_Of_Rain20,3,Sat Jul 11 03:26:56 2015 UTC,"Since coming to the Jays in 2013, amongst qualified SS's, he is   5th in WAR 9th in RAR 6th in wRC+ 4th lowest K% 5th in SB 5th in wOBA   I'd say that's a fair claim."
Torontobluejays,3cucff,allirow,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:30:39 2015 UTC,I agree. During the Jerry Howarth criticism thing he basically said something to the tune of 'that's how I play if you don't like it deal with it' which is pretty immature since his style might not gel with what the team is trying to accomplish. You really have to know your enemy before you trying risky plays like that.
Torontobluejays,3cucff,ColdStoryBro,4,Sat Jul 11 03:26:06 2015 UTC,"Jose Reyes is worth 9.6 RAR (runs above replacement) through 57 games.  To give you some context, Troy Tulowitzki is worth 10.9 RAR in 77 games.  Ryan Goins is worth -1.3."
Torontobluejays,3cucff,allirow,0,Sat Jul 11 03:25:15 2015 UTC,"You pulled out one stat?  Try sorting this list by the various categories. That's Reyes compared with the top 20 or so shortstops in the majors. In pretty much every category he's middling.  He's a trainwreck.  It seems to me, if Charles Manson was seen wearing a Blue Jays shirt, you'd defend him too."

For a rental no thanks.  I know it's a fake rumour but if it came out that the Jays traded Norris, Hoffman and Alford for Shark and Robertson or a similar trade that should literally get AA fired on the spot."
Torontobluejays,3ctjia,Ferivich,-1,Fri Jul 10 18:17:22 2015 UTC,"I know, AA wouldn't want to actually be a playoff contender in September or anything like that.  Before you dismiss giving up these so called ""hot young prospects"", just remember what happened to McGowan, Morrow, and Romero. There are no guarantees with these guys, but there are guarantees when it comes to proven MLB players."
Torontobluejays,3ctjia,cozeners,9,Fri Jul 10 19:22:46 2015 UTC,"There's no guarantees that a rental player will make a difference for us. Trading away the potential of said prospects for 3 months of Johnny Cueto or the sorts is more harmful to the organization then anything, unless we are willing to throw away our future for one shot this year."
Torontobluejays,3ctjia,WayneM70,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:16:16 2015 UTC,It's not harmful if we're already in first place with a several game lead.  Rental players should be used to strengthen the pre-existing final push.
Torontobluejays,3ctjia,WayneM70,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:54:01 2015 UTC,Have you watched the last 4 games or...?
Torontobluejays,3ctjia,cozeners,0,Sat Jul 11 05:46:27 2015 UTC,"Which failed for Oakland....  In my opinion, it's not about anything that's guaranteed, it's about playing the percentages. Good, proven players will more often than not help you win more games. It won't work every year, but it will work if you rely on it as a plan, from year to year. In the past 2 seasons I didn't feel they needed rentals. But this year is different. Their offence is off the charts and all they need is mediocre pitching."
Torontobluejays,3ctjia,darth-helmet,2,Sat Jul 11 01:22:39 2015 UTC,There's no guarantees with proven players either. It can and does happen where a big deadline acquisition doesn't pan out and teams miss the playoffs or the player they picked up doesn't play well enough to give the team the lift they needed and expected.
Torontobluejays,3ctjia,joeap,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:28:41 2015 UTC,"You can pretty much guarantee that Johnny Cueto, Cole Hamels, or Jeff Samadizja will be better than any of our current starters."
Torontobluejays,3ctjia,Ferivich,2,Fri Jul 10 23:24:39 2015 UTC,"Brandon Morrow had three good seasons in a row. 3.6, 3.1 and 2.4 fWAR, those are good #3/#2 starter numbers, he was also gotten for Brandon League who wasn't good so that's irrelevant. Ricky Romero was an OK mid rotation, back end starter until he ran into knee issues and McGowan was McGowan.  Trading three high end prospects for rentals, or free agent contracts (people we could've spent that money on 5-6 months ago) is stupid. It's one of the issues the Marlins trade was sort of shitty. We traded good prospects for contracts that were no longer inexpensive on players we could have tried to sign the winter before.  If we're doing a trade and it involved 45 FV+ prospects you should be getting someone with 2+ years of control. Don't sell the farm for 2 months and a few weeks of a player that you won't get anything for when they hit free agency.  Unless we're moving a FA contract for another FA contract. St Louis as an example might be interested in EE for one of their starters.  Our team needs more than one starter. We need a LF (if Saunders isn't healthy), we need some RP arms and probably two SP arms."
Torontobluejays,3ctjia,baseballfan901,8,Sat Jul 11 00:00:29 2015 UTC,Would rather hold prospects
Torontobluejays,3ctjia,Wh3at159,5,Fri Jul 10 17:53:36 2015 UTC,"So would I. So our rookie pitchers didn't hack it this year, I'd rather have them all (Stroman, Norris and Sanchez) and have another go at it. Maybe Hutch can pull himself together, after a full season of working with Martin there's no reason he shouldn't. If they all come back next year throwing hot fire along side Castro and Osuna in the bullpen. Trading youth, especially with this amount of talent, will just come back to bite us later.   My perception is simular with our position players. Do we know if Navarro still wants to be traded for a full time gig? Who will play backup when Martin needs a break. Pillar and Travis would be in our best interest to hold on to. Jose(s) and Edwin are locked in for next year, the power is there but the avg isn't.   I just don't want to see the Jays trade for 1 arm that won't make a big difference anyway. There's no way 1 arm will come in a get this team into the playoffs they way the Jays seem to slump."

Torontobluejays,3ctjia,deadskin,10,Fri Jul 10 18:22:05 2015 UTC,"Because he had Tommy John Surgery, and only because of that.   Surely you don't actually think that someone that was expected to be drafted 1st overall, and drawn comparisons to ""Justin Verlander in his prime"" is measured by where they happen to be pitching?  Yes, he may get hurt again, but his true-talent level is higher than ANY pitcher in the Jays' org in over a decade."
Torontobluejays,3ctjia,HW_Plainview,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:47:29 2015 UTC,Scouts make outlandish comparisons all the time to justify their selectsions.

You have to balance sustainability with winning now. I don't think you understand how value works. Oakland gave addison russell for Jeff Samardzjia, gave to get etc and it didn't put them over the top the way you seem to be under the impression of. Sama left and Russell who would have been in their lineup for years is now a stud prospect in the cubs lineup."

And I'm trying to figure out why.  The division is the closest it's been in years (we're .500 and only 3.5 back of the division lead?), the offense is redonkulous, and the prospects we have are starting to get nibbles on trade deals.  If not now, when? Because just as likely as our prospects blooming into fantastic MLBers is the Yankees or Red Sox taking over the division again for another goddamn dynasty. And then we're back in the late 1990s or early 2000s where even good Jays teams can't make the playoffs because those two are hogging the spots."
Torontobluejays,3ctjia,matdwyer,2,Sat Jul 11 00:56:27 2015 UTC,Most people seem to be okay with trading away our big prospects.  The hesitation seems to be trading away out big prospects for rentals.  Players with team control seem to be generally accepted by everyone.

Torontobluejays,3cvup1,BlueJaysWatch,2,Sat Jul 11 05:26:54 2015 UTC,"Most ""everyday"" catchers will catch 120-130 games out of the 162. That's one in 4 to one in 5 games off.  Lately we've had a lot day games after night games, and you never want the same catcher in both of those games.  Catching Dickey is extremely tiring so off days are definitely needed either right before, or soon after a Dickey start.  Combine that with the fact that the trade deadline is almost here and playing Navarro more can act as a ""showcase"" for him and build trade value."
Torontobluejays,3cvup1,xzElmozx,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:44:45 2015 UTC,"As of now we need a few key pieces (Solid rotation guy, maybe 2 good bullpen pitchers and a consistent bat for the middle/bottom of the order) in order to be a playoff team. So fluffing up Dioners value makes sense.  As well, we have had a lot of games packed in to a very short period of time. Im sure Martin would definitley be appreciating these breaks. If we were playing 3-4 games a week spread out then it might be different."

Torontobluejays,3cuiru,baconreader9000,11,Fri Jul 10 22:21:04 2015 UTC,"This.   OP makes it sound like we have a bunch of problems and playoffs are unlikely anyway.   Incorrect.   We have ONE problem. And it's a huge, huge problem. Pitching."
Torontobluejays,3cuiru,Hadly,2,Fri Jul 10 23:14:25 2015 UTC,Well we have two problems. Left field and Pitching. Pitching is more important though.
Torontobluejays,3cuiru,ExplainsSocialEnigma,6,Sat Jul 11 01:57:49 2015 UTC,"The A's did a stupid, stupid move.  They massively overpaid for Samardzjia (and Hammel was not that great of a pitcher overall).  Pitching was also not their biggest weakness at the time, hitting was.  Then they went and traded away one of their best bats for another pitcher.  However, there's one thing we do know unequivocally, and that's that the Jays rotation is in the bottom 5 of MLB.  Not the AL, all of MLB.  If the Jays have any hope to sustain themselves down the stretch, they need starters.  The bullpen has made great strides as the season has gone on, but the starters have not.  If they made it to the playoffs as is, they would not be facing scrub hitters and pitchers, they would be facing the cream of the crop.  Their offense may do okay against playoff caliber pitching, but their starters will get decimated.  Dickey is a crapshoot one start to the next, Buehrle is never a lock for a 'dominant' start, merely consistent, and Hutchison can only pitch at home.  Outside of that, you'd be relying on Aaron Sanchez and/or Marco Estrada.  Even if Stroman makes it back, he's missed the entire year, would you really want to hand the ball off to him in the highest of high pressure situations just after coming back from a torn ACL?  The Jays need starters.  That's a fact.  I'm not saying the blow the farm on Cueto or someone, but AA is known for finding good talent with team control (Yunel Escobar, Colby Rasmus), without blowing up the team.  Other teams that the Jays are directly competing against have the same needs, they will only get better if the Jays stand pat.  AA has prospects to deal, and getting 1-2 good starters with team control left will help not only this year, but next as well."

Stroman hasn't help us contend at all this season and let's not pretend Sanchez is an All-star with his 4.52 xFIP and 4.85 SIERA Pillar isn't a prospect.

I don't mean this in a douchey way but we're not Tampa or Oakland. Losing a few prospects isn't gonna fuck is over for 5-10 years like them. Sometimes you need to just close your eyes and fire off a shot in life. Maybe come August Norris blows his arm out and never pitches well again. I'd rather balls the fuck up and go after it now than wait until Bautista, EE, Martin etc. are all well passed their prime (if they arent already).

Torontobluejays,3coy2z,kushblazers,7,Thu Jul 9 16:34:06 2015 UTC,http://www.fangraphs.com/library/misc/clutch/  The clutch rating is really not very good at prediciting how clutch someone will be in the future. Clutch hitters only exist anecdotely
Torontobluejays,3coy2z,go_sens,8,Fri Jul 10 01:51:29 2015 UTC,"Great hitters will generally be the ""clutch"" ones because they are great hitters to begin with. Not because they have some magical innate ability. I still don't buy that ""being clutch"" is a skill."
Torontobluejays,3coy2z,Qwyjibo_,0,Thu Jul 9 18:51:44 2015 UTC,"I think that ""being clutch"" is mostly about not letting your nerves/adrenaline get the best of it.  You sometimes see hitters get up to the plate while the bases are loaded and they swing at everything, trying to be the hero or get that grand slam on their books.  Not every out or pitch carries the same weight though. Some come with added pressure.  Maybe, I think, the best way to measure it would be to strap heart rate monitors on these guys and see whether there is a spike in certain situations.  Imagine a rookie stepping to the plate with two outs and two on, down by one, having to face Mariano Rivera. Maybe his heart starts beating a little faster. Maybe he gets inside his head a bit.  ""Clutch"", to me, would mean that the situation doesn't impact you on those levels.  It might not be a ""skill"" in the sense that it something that you can practice, per se, but more about confidence and being able to stay calm and focused."
Torontobluejays,3coy2z,p3ndulum,3,Fri Jul 10 08:56:44 2015 UTC,"When people say it's not a skill, they generally mean that it's not a repeatable skill; you can only identify it after it happens. You can't predict it based on past performance. Which, when you use the example of identifying people that are skilled at winning the lottery, makes you realize how it's not really a skill at all."
Torontobluejays,3coy2z,tojoso,2,Fri Jul 10 12:44:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe his heart starts beating a little faster. Maybe he gets inside his head a bit.   A brain scan (which is actually referenced in the article) is probably a better measure than heart rate, partly for the reasons /u/ScratchOneMore mentioned but also because great baseball performance requires a ""state of flow"" - a certain mental calmness and focus."
Torontobluejays,3coy2z,Royal_Flush13,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:47:37 2015 UTC,"The issue with that though, is for some people, an increased heart rate could be a good thing, while for others it could be bad.   For example, we could measure player A who's hr goes up to 160 bpm in close situations, but is batting .700 in these situations. On the flip side, there could be player B who's hr stays at 80, but is batting .120 in clutch situations."

Torontobluejays,3coy2z,stman4,12,Fri Jul 10 02:27:27 2015 UTC,"Josh Donaldson has lived up to his reputation this season as a player who thrives in high-pressure situations, but is there such a thing as a clutch hitter?   That depends on how you define a clutch hitter. Are players capable of elevating their game beyond established expectations in clutch situations? No, probably not. Otherwise they would hit that way all the time.  Are some players capable of maintaining an expected level of performance in the clutch due to mental factors? Yeah, some more than others I'm sure. But these guys didn't get to this level without knowing how to handle high-pressure situations.  The headline should read ""Jays' Josh Donaldson might be proof that Josh Donaldson is really fucking good."""
Torontobluejays,3coy2z,Royal_Flush13,5,Thu Jul 9 17:49:40 2015 UTC,"That depends on how you define a clutch hitter. Are players capable of elevating their game beyond established expectations in clutch situations? No, probably not. Otherwise they would hit that way all the time.   Maybe. But stress causes physiological effects that are unsustainable, which is why we're not bursting with adrenaline all the time. It is conceivable that players could temporarily maintain elevated and unsustainable levels of performance. And in a sport such as baseball, where a season involves almost 500 hours of playing time, it's possible that you might really need to pick your spots lest you get worn down."
Torontobluejays,3coy2z,ExplainsSocialEnigma,2,Thu Jul 9 20:36:07 2015 UTC,Stats show that doesn't happen though. Only 2 players could be considered to have actually elevated their game on a regular basis. Id have to check but I think they are Ricky Henderson and Paul molitor
Torontobluejays,3coy2z,belardi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:25:34 2015 UTC,The types of players most likely to do that are guys with great discipline/vision (Rickey) and/or exceptional bat control (Molitor). Mark Grace is another guy who comes to mind as he was always a great situational hitter due to his bat control and ability to extend ABs.

Torontobluejays,3coy2z,Royal_Flush13,4,Fri Jul 10 15:13:14 2015 UTC,David Ortiz playoffs batting average probably the closest it gets for MLB.
Torontobluejays,3coy2z,Royal_Flush13,3,Thu Jul 9 18:23:15 2015 UTC,It's like he was playing slo-pitch softball...in the World Series.
Torontobluejays,3coy2z,tojoso,3,Thu Jul 9 18:37:21 2015 UTC,"Not really. I don't know why you'd use average to describe how good a hitter is, but anyway: .283 regular season and .295 in the playoffs. Then factor in that he was in the playoffs during the prime years of his career (not in his first few seasons in Minnesota, and not in the last couple years in Boston - he had his three worst seasons in those early and late years). Also, his regular season average is more adversely affected by the shift of the past couple seasons (he's always faced a shift, but the past two seasons have been by far the most he's ever been shifted). From his first playoff appearance in Boston up until his last playoff appearance in 2013, his regular season BA was .292 compared to .295 in the playoffs. Literally one less blooper falls for a hit and he has an identical batting average.  Also, lets consider that out of all MLB players, quite a few are bound to be much better (and much worse) in the playoffs compared to the regular season based on variance alone, without any change in skill. And the not-so-minor fact that we are looking at one player, making this an anecdote rather than data."
Torontobluejays,3coy2z,Royal_Flush13,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:41:48 2015 UTC,Did you miss the WS in 2013? He was on another level that wasn't just random variance. A 12-point BA spike in the toughest competition in the world with the sample size he has is pretty damn impressive.
Torontobluejays,3coy2z,tojoso,2,Fri Jul 10 13:24:02 2015 UTC,"Did you see that one at-bat that he crushed a ball over the CF fence in the world series? He batted 1.000 with a 5.000 OPS in that at-bat! He had literally over 100 at-bats in the regular season where he batted 0.000 with a 0.000 OPS, but he stepped it up big time in that World Series at-bat. Clearly this proves not only that clutch hitters exist, but that Papi is the best of them all!"

Nice snark though, but I have an inkling I'm just as, if not much more, statistically aware than you - considering it's my day job to be. If you had watched that WS, he wasn't exactly squeaking grounders through the infield and dropping bloops in front of the OF. It was a real hot streak. Whether it is a predictable, consistent thing is something else altogether. But you can't deny that it was about as ""clutch"" as any baseball player has ever been - and he's done it plenty of times in his career.  EDITED to remove snark and add context."

This is hardly a comprehensive analysis.   a study...    Lol. There are several studies on clutch hitting, with mixed results. The one thing they seem to agree on is that clutch hitting is not a predictable, consistent phenomenon worth measuring a player's value over. There are, however, certain types of hitters more prone to performing a little better in clutch situations - smart situational hitters who have a consistent approach and good discipline and bat control."

Would you encourage guys at the craps table to increase their bets after they're on a ""real hot streak""??  Variance/luck doesn't just mean that the fielders play good, or play bad, or that pitchers make more mistake pitches; it also means he squares up more balls than he usually does, times them better than he usually does, swings at better pitches, chases fewer bad ones, etc.  You're gonna have to do better than pointing to a handful of games as a sample size for one player before you declare hot streaks a real thing. People far more statistically capable than me or you have shown that there is no such thing as being ""locked in"". I would suggest reading ""The Book"" for a pretty good rundown on pretty much anything to do with baseball statistics. Two of the authors (Tango and Lichtman) have done further work after this to debunk the myth of the hot streak."

No. And I never said anything indicating that. Hot streaks exist - even Litchtman and Tango would agree with that. Baseball is not the fucking craps table - its played by real human beings with real control (though incomplete) over the outcomes. As a fantasy player, I wouldn't bet on a hot streak continuing indefinitely - but they happen for a reason and part of that reason is genuinely better play from mental, physical, and mechanical factors.   it also means he squares up more balls than he usually does, times them better than he usually does, swings at better pitches, chases fewer bad ones, etc.   Sure. And he still did that. And you can't deny that. Whether it happens at unpredictable times is irrelevant - the motherfucker got hot and you can't take that away from him. People don't just suddenly start mashing baseballs like he did because they got lucky. This isn't ceteris paribus. All variables were not equal. He was focused, seeing the ball better than usual, and on an absolute tear. It doesn't last forever - that's why hot streaks end and clutchiness is unpredictable - but it happens and it's very real. It's also very, very sensitive to emotion and a number of other factors and can swing the other way in the matter of a single game. If you've played enough baseball you would know what it feels like. They ain't CPUs on the field.   I would suggest reading ""The Book"" for a pretty good rundown on pretty much anything to do with baseball statistics.   Oh, would you? lol.

Obviously is happens to great hitters more than bad hitters, because it requires less variance for great hitters to do it.   He was focused, seeing the ball better than usual, and on an absolute tear. It doesn't last forever   This is just nonsense. It's only identifiable after the fact. Nobody says ""he's seeing the ball better than usual, he's going to go on a tear."" It's always ""he already went on a tear, therefore he must have been seeing the ball better than usual."" Same reasoning gambling addicts use when they're at a casino. Selective memory is a wonderful thing.   If you've played enough baseball you would know what it feels like. They ain't CPUs on the field.   I've played competitive baseball for the past 20 years. I know what it feels like to hit a few home runs in a bunch, and I never think that I'm all of a sudden a world class player for a week and then back to being a schmuck for the rest of the season.

Whether you could see it coming is a totally different point that you seem to be hung up on my apparently suggesting, which I haven't at any point.   Same reasoning gambling addicts use when they're at a casino   No, dummy. Because baseball isn't totally random. It's a useful assumption for big-picture statistical modelling, but it doesn't reflect the micro-events that happen throughout the year. You seem to have a hard time separating them.   I know what it feels like to hit a few home runs in a bunch, and I never think that I'm all of a sudden a world class player for a week and then back to being a schmuck for the rest of the season.   That's fine. Neither does anyone else. But you hit those homers, you put the right swings on them. Your arms didn't just swerve around and randomly connect. I'm sure you've had sessions in the cage that felt better than others, despite every pitch from the machine being basically the same. Those happened for emotional, physiological, and environmental reasons that can be pretty chaotic in the macro sense, but are still very real in the micro sense.  You're totally misunderstanding me, which is unfortunate for someone who claims to have played competitively for 20 years."

I think the vast majority of people in the world are the exact opposite, which is often what separates athletes.

Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,EndsLikeShakespeare,12,Thu Jul 9 20:32:12 2015 UTC,Brutal fucking series. Should've been 3-1 at least.
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,ilikehockey2,8,Thu Jul 9 20:34:55 2015 UTC,Well...it was....  :( :( :(
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,ImArcherVaderAMA,18,Thu Jul 9 20:48:11 2015 UTC,"Well I'm glad that I'm at work and didn't watch a second of this game.  The Jays are showing why I am 100% against selling the farm for even great rental players like Cueto. They don't need pitching to put them over the top in the race, they need pitching to at least stay in the race. I wouldn't sacrifice the future for a merely a chance at that.  I mean that long-term because obviously pitching wasn't the issue today."
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,Qwyjibo_,6,Thu Jul 9 20:33:26 2015 UTC,"No rentals, please. As much as it'd be cool to have a guy like Cueto we just don't seem to be in a position to make a serious push into the post season, even with the addition of an ace. We aren't consistent enough in any aspect."
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,Megakenny,7,Thu Jul 9 20:37:41 2015 UTC,The offense has consistently been good all season long up until this point. They are in a tiny slump.  RENTALS FUCKING PLEASE. You're nuts.
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,HW_Plainview,3,Fri Jul 10 02:54:12 2015 UTC,As the season progresses I am feeling the same way. Most of the core will be here next year and our younger talent will get some experience this year and heighten their game for next year. Seems like adding 1 arm in the rotation won't be elevating us over the top this year.
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,Wh3at159,3,Thu Jul 9 20:40:07 2015 UTC,Most of the core will be older and worse next year though. So we'll need to upgrade big time in order to maintain competitiveness.
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,ExplainsSocialEnigma,2,Thu Jul 9 21:13:26 2015 UTC,"The comments on here are astounding. EE and Bautista are already starting to regress. And we can't seriously expect people like Colabello and Valencia to carry this team, as good as they've been."

Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,ExplainsSocialEnigma,-6,Fri Jul 10 03:22:47 2015 UTC,"Pillar, Goins, Osuna, and Stroman (edit: and Travs) are the only good, young players we have. Everybody else is either old enough that they're probably getting worse before they get better or haven't shown that they can be valuable at the big-league level.  If we don't compete this year, it's only going to be harder next year."
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,ExplainsSocialEnigma,5,Thu Jul 9 20:46:44 2015 UTC,"Yea that 29 year old josh donaldson is shit. Showing signs of slowing down, what a horrible player /s"
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,xzElmozx,-1,Thu Jul 9 20:53:48 2015 UTC,"All infielders age quickly. There are only 4 qualified 3B over the age of 30: Beltre, Freeze, Prado, and Escobar and all of them are past their prime.  Donaldson is excellent but he's towards the tail of his prime. He might be able to decline very slowly and reasonably maintain his excellence, but he's definitely not getting better next year and will probably be worse."
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:24:00 2015 UTC,Of those players you mentioned the only one whose done anything at Donaldsons' level is Beltre and he turned in his best career years from ages 31-35.
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,strikeanywhere2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:43:30 2015 UTC,"Well by far his best year was when he was 24 but you're right he struggled he had an early-30s resurgence.  But hitting aging curves are just getting younger and fielding peaks earliest of all. Of the older Jays stars he's the youngest and thus the least likely to decline, but he's still not immune.  And if you want a pair of closer-to-home examples of declining 3rd basemen, look no further than EE and Bautista. Encarnacion had to abandon 3B after his age-27 season and his best offensive year was in his age 29 season; every year since has been less valuable than the last. Bautista abandoned 3B in the middle of his age-30 season (when Brett Lawrie came up) and his two best offensive years were in his age-29 and 30 seasons. None of the seasons since have been as valuable as either of those.  Even if they all stay pretty good or excellent, as a group they're pretty much guaranteed to get worse, even if it's only a little bit. But every little bit counts."
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:06:52 2015 UTC,"Yea, great idea bringing out donaldson you goof.  The guy is on pace for the best season of his career by far."
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,Morphine_Jesus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:02:57 2015 UTC,"And it probably will be the best season of his entire career. That's the point: he's probably never going to have another season as good as this one. That said, he's arguably not even playing better than he was in Oakland - his 2013 season started even better than this one.  3B's simply start to decline hard after that age. It happened to Bautista and Encarnacion too.  EE abandoned 3B after his age-27 season and his best offensive season was in his age-29 year. Every year since has been worse than the last.   Bautista abandoned playing 3B in the middle of his age-30 season. Bautista declined considerably in his age-31 season and hasn't since put together a season as good as his 2010, 2011 years. He's still good, but he's less good and less healthy.  Donaldson will still be very good next year, but he's probably not going to be as good, that's the point."
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:26:55 2015 UTC,"Bautista's 2014 season was just as good as his 2010 season, EE was just as good as his age 29 year by WRC+ last year, just played less games. Bautista and Edwin moved off third because they weren't very good there at any point in their careers"
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,strikeanywhere2,2,Thu Jul 9 22:42:16 2015 UTC,"Bautista's 2014 season was just as good as his 2010 season   Well it was slightly worse.   EE was just as good as his age 29 year by WRC+ last year, just played less games   And he played less games because he was injured, which happens more often for longer as you get older.   It's pretty uncontroversial that players get worse as they age past 30. And we have about a half-dozen important players that meet that criterion. It's a near-guarantee that that core will collectively play worse next year and every subsequent year, so if this team is to improve it needs to upgrade (or have their younger players improve) above and beyond that decline."
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,ExplainsSocialEnigma,-1,Thu Jul 9 22:54:56 2015 UTC,"Really .2 WAR is slightly worse? .2 is well within the margin of error for WAR. Also I didn't mean the core won't get worse, most of what I said is regarding Donaldson not declining too hard over the next few years. Offensively this team is surely at its peak for a while, I'd imagine this is by far the best offensive season we see from Martin by far."
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,strikeanywhere2,0,Thu Jul 9 23:56:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know what you're really disagreeing with then. You agree that the core will decline and that Donaldson will decline too.  Yeah, he's probably not going to decline hard next year, but none of them are. The point is that they constitute a majority of out valuable frontline players and, as a collective, they're almost certainly going to get worse and less healthy."
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,ExplainsSocialEnigma,-5,Fri Jul 10 00:06:11 2015 UTC,He went 0 for 4 today.  His career is basically over.
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,ImArcherVaderAMA,2,Thu Jul 9 21:15:01 2015 UTC,"And Goins went 1-2, completely negating his career .217/.245/.307 line."
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,Qwyjibo_,3,Thu Jul 9 21:19:15 2015 UTC,Obviously going to be the Jays MVP in the second half.
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,ImArcherVaderAMA,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:21:23 2015 UTC,"You misspelled ""Travis"". It's not G-o-i-n-s.  But sure I can see your side. Bautista, EE, Reyes and Martin aren't going to get any better. I guess the hope is that some of the young pitchers (Norris, Osuna, Sanchez) emerge as MLB capable starters while the other ones (Stroman, Hutchison?!) continue developing."
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,Qwyjibo_,0,Thu Jul 9 21:01:36 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I forgot Travis.  But the point still stands that the overwhelming majority of our valuable players, i.e. Martin, Donaldson, Bautista, Reyes, Buerhle, Encarnacion (and FWIW Delabar and Colabello), are not young so every year that passes will result in decline in the skill quality (or active status) of that core.  So for us to get more competitive we need to not only improve the areas where we're weak now. We also need to compensate for the areas where we're going to be weaker tomorrow.  We look a bit like the 2010 Yankees: a good, old team. But unlike the Yankees our owners haven't committed to expand payroll, so if we don't win now, we're kinda fucked."
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,ExplainsSocialEnigma,-1,Thu Jul 9 21:10:36 2015 UTC,goins fucking sucks.
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,Zoidberg22,-1,Thu Jul 9 20:56:20 2015 UTC,What do you mean pitching will just help them stay in the race. Are you saying because they got shut out by a good pitcher the offence isn't good enough?

Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,Orion_Jeriko,-2,Thu Jul 9 22:45:21 2015 UTC,"In retrospect, I think AA pulled the trade trigger too soon.  In 2012, he had a downward-trending team that had lowered its winning % 3 consecutive years, from .525 to .500 to .451. He had a system full of young talent, as well as a few on the roster, by the names of Lawrie, Gose, Sierra, Hechavarria, Hutchison, Henderson Alvarez, d'Arnaud, Yan Gomes, Snider, Marisnick, Nolin, Stroman, Pillar, Pompey, DeSclafani, Nicolino, Sanchez, Syndergaard, Osuna, and Castro.  Had he waited patiently, and gone through the growing pains, we could have a lineup as follows:  C - d'Arnaud/Gomes, 1B - Encarnacion, 2B - Travis (in Gose trade), SS - Hechavarria, 3B - Donaldson (in Lawrie trade), LF - Pillar/Snider, CF - Pillar/Pompey/Marisnick, RF - Bautista/Snider  P - Hutchison, Alvarez, Stroman, Syndergaard, Sanchez, Osuna, Castro, Nicolino, DeSclafani  He could've seen how they fared and made changes then. Ah, but we fans are impatient, and AA probably is too, and the players on the team, and the ownership...  It's too bad we're not the Astros, whose people had resigned them to worse than mediocrity before this season when all their development began to bear fruit."
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,cookiemountain18,3,Thu Jul 9 23:16:40 2015 UTC,I don't understand the point of bringing this up all the time.    At the time of that trade.  It was a home run for us.   At the time of the deal yoi make that trade every single time
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,cookiemountain18,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:10:30 2015 UTC,"This is the first time I've brought it up. Sorry if you've heard it before. I was very nervous at the time of those big trades. We gave up some serious talent for very high priced, past-their-prime talents. Reyes had been injured with groin and quad problems (seriously worrying with a speedster), and Dickey had had one great season in the NL (with no reason to think he'd be able to repeat that performance or translate well to the AL or Rogers Stadium, where ground balls are preferred). Buerhle was a proven ironman, but he also cost $20 million.  But more importantly, if they'd have exercised patience, they could have seen who translated into MLB players and who didn't, and been able to build around that youthful core, which happened to be AAs initial stated plan, and a good one at that."
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,ChillinOnTheBeach,2,Fri Jul 10 02:37:46 2015 UTC,I never downvoted you.  If that matters.  But I've seen it a million times.  We were projected to win it all after those two trades.  I just don't think anyone can fault AA for making those trades at the time.   At the time.  It was the right move.  It for the most part backfired.  But nobody really knew that would happen at the time.
Torontobluejays,3cpu7d,Zoidberg22,0,Fri Jul 10 04:12:23 2015 UTC,"At the time, I thought AA had bought players for their past, and everyone -- him, the fans, the press -- got excited because of that. They mistook the past for the future.   To be fair, yes, the team was improved by the trades because unready minor leaguers were replaced with quality MLB players. It's not like Dickey, Buerhle, or Reyes have stunk with the Jays. It's just that none of them are the studs they were expected to be. (Except for me... I expected them to perform like players past their prime, and... Yep. That's what they are.)   Thanks for not down voting. It was intended for discussion, as is reddit's MO."

The '92 Jays went on an 8-14 stretch in August that had fans wringing their hands in despair. The '93 Jays went 1-10 in the last 11 games right before the all-star break. I hear those seasons ended up being okay.  I'm not saying this team is as good as those were, or that the results will be similar this year. All I'm saying is that good teams have bad stretches, and baseball is played over weeks and months, not individual days, and there's a lot of baseball yet to be played.   So relax, crack a beer, and enjoy the great game of baseball. It's a long summer yet."

I had no idea how strong it truly was to be honest, until someone in this thread linked statistics for me. So, here, let me enlighten you as to why this is not just ""some slump"", it's more of a consistent failure to pull through mid-season. But hey, if you guys can keep your hopes up against all odds, good for you. I just don't have that kind of resolve. I'll hold on for another week or two though, hoping for things to be different this year.  Here's the comment, copy and pasted for your convenience.   Here is the Blue Jays' July/August W/L record every season since 1995:   1995 - 26-32  1996 - 27-29  1997 - 28-30  1998 - 29-25  1999 - 31-23*  2000 - 26-27  2001 - 27-28  2002 - 26-31  2003 - 21-32  2004 - 20-34  2005 - 26-27  2006 - 24-31  2007 - 29-25  2008 - 29-23*  2009 - 18-32  2010 - 29-24  2011 - 28-26  2012 - 20-33  2013 - 22-33  2014 - 24-28  2015 - 3-6 so far...  The two seasons I marked with (*) are the only ones where they had what we might consider a really strong record. The 4 other above-.500 July/Augusts are barely enough to make up for their other awful months. The OP has every right to ask if people think the Jays are in it, because the pattern has been basically the same every season for 20 years.  And especially is this true when you look at these last 3 John Gibbons years. The pattern is eerily familiar: Get really hot in May/June then fade fast in July/August."
Torontobluejays,3ctdan,tetrahydrocanada,3,Fri Jul 10 19:43:50 2015 UTC,"The majority of those seasons have nothing to do with this current team.

I guess I'm just left to wonder: if you have all the answers, if the results are forgone and the season was over before it began, why do you care at all? Why would you follow the team, why would you care what your brother thinks, and why would you come to the teams subreddit, hoping to find people to agree with you? Wouldn't it be easier for you to, yknow, not do those things? Seems like a lot of wasted energy for a team that you clearly don't like very much..."

Not to mention the fact that our GM is strangely adamant about acquiring top starters at the deadline, as opposed to his normal, non-committal stances.  No.  No chance at all."
Torontobluejays,3ctdan,cozeners,0,Fri Jul 10 17:02:25 2015 UTC,"I like you're optimism, and I hope it works but...   Is Saunders really returning? How long have they been saying this? And since when does the offence even need him? Our current left fielders, combined, have way better numbers than Saunders has ever put up in his career. What has Sanchez proven at the MLB level? Very little. AFAIC, every one of these ""young pitchers"" is the same as Dustin McGowan, Brandon Morrow, and Rickey Romero. And I put Stroman (who had a 4.11 ERA in mid-august last season) in that same category. None of them has proven anything yet. Mark Buehrle is still our only reliable pitcher. What indication is there that AA is ""strangely adamant"" about acquiring pitching? I've seen nothing different from what he's done in the past. He's all talk, and then when the deadline passes he says ""The price was too high."" Until a deal is made, I will assume it's business as usual. In fact, every time I see an article about AA's possible acquisitions, I just assume it's Rogers spinning things to get fans to buy August tickets before the deadline passes and we move on to our usual post-'94 summer activities."

I'll keep watching for now though, I'm just feeling it coming again, that time of the year when the Jays / Leafs hopes are dashed, and only the really hardcore fans stick around.

And it's not particularly encouraging: a .500 team with a lineup hole in LF and a rotation pit.  Starting pitchers will be expensive as hell this year so we're either not getting it, or we're selling the farm. Neither look too appealing."

Saying the jays are stastically bad against a particular pitcher or team isn't really accurate considering how many new faces both teams may have from one year to the next.   To say a team's hitting percentage against another team is historically bad doesn't really take into account different players coming in, philosophies of different hitting coaches, etc.  Even if the trend is that they are statistically poor against that team, it isn't automatic that they will be.  A team that has dipped in form around the same time for a few years in a row is never condemned to automatically dip again at that time in the present year, as there are too many factors on a ball club that are in flux from one year to the next.  As fans our hopes and expectations ride on the data from previous years we've watched,  but thats all they are. Hopes and expectations. They dont dictate the reality."

You try to prepare yourself early for the failure. I struggle with the same thing as you. I want to say fuck it, and not watch so I can spare myself of the misery of the consistent failure of this organization but I keep getting drawn back in and I can't keep myself from caring how the team does. See people are going to downvote this post, but I completely understand the sentiment. Year after year, I put money, time and emotions into this team. Year after year, we're supposed to have the lineup to finally break through in the AL East. We are supposed to have the rotation to finally break the playoff drought which has now stretched to the longest in North American sports. But year after year, there is no payoff for the investment. It taxes you, it wears on you and it is supremely frustrating. They are still in it but god damn if it is not frustrating to watch this organization."

IIRC he had a 50+ game hitting streak in college that only ended because of a line out and three walks where they basically pitched around him. It's taken a bit of time at the big league level but with his defense he could have a very good career of he can maintain a .265+ average.   Add 25-30 points and we're talking upper echelon though.

Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,gavotron5,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:19:26 2015 UTC,No Dickey is a SP who eats innings not a RP. Has been shit this season but still he isn't a bad option. I have been hating on him recently but mostly because of his contract. He is not worth that type of money. We tend to forget how he throws opposing teams hitters off a lot. Enough to mess the hitters timing for the following day. Not sure the exact stats but teams have problems adjusting back to regular MLB fastball pitchers after facing a knuckle baller.
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,kushblazers,3,Thu Jul 9 04:56:59 2015 UTC,i actually don't even think about his contract. i think about the 35% chance he has to win each game
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,another_plebeian,3,Thu Jul 9 16:37:20 2015 UTC,Personally I'm a little more upset about this guy
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,grits-n-gravyy,0,Thu Jul 9 17:54:07 2015 UTC,It seems like he doesn't have his mojo right now. The good thing about a knuckle ball pitcher is that he doesn't have to hit the gym or do steroids to beef up his location. He just has to be more accurate with his pitches and get a bit more movement on that knuckle ball. These are all things a pitcher can work on mid season. I decided to stop hating on Dickey and I think he will have a better 2nd half. My point is we don't need Dickey to pitch like David Price. All we need is a 3rd or 4th option in our rotation that will go deep in games and give our bats a chance to win the game early. He had a pretty good June if you look at his #s. Dickey would be an alright option but his contract is complete shit and hard to move. The Jays are obviously not getting their ROI when it comes to Dickey. The Jays pitching staff is like that one gambler who just went on a 10 bet losing streak. Can it get much worse? I am putting $50 on Dickey to win the baseball game tonight by -1.5 or more runs.

Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,Psychegotical,8,Thu Jul 9 18:55:41 2015 UTC,"Dickey's last start was terrible, and he had a terrible start to the season. However, he did have an ERA of 3.32 in June, so lets not be so quick to write him off."
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,kapacj,3,Thu Jul 9 19:35:06 2015 UTC,"While I'm frustrated at the games that we've lost because ""thats just how knuckleballers go"", I'd still rather have R.A. take 5 innings than three bullpen arms, so they stay ready for the next game. We'll need to be ready for KC"
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,Mapleleaf97,2,Thu Jul 9 19:38:19 2015 UTC,I'm just glad it isn't RA against KC. Dickey can beat CWS with run support on an off night. We need Buerhle/Marco/Dubront for KC.

Just carry more relievers if you're worried about overuse.  8 -man bullpens are a thing. Or start Dickey in front of Buerhle. 5 high-quality innings are way more valuable than 7 mediocre innings. We can always throw more mediocre long-men at the problem is that we need more mediocre innings."

Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,cozy04,2,Thu Jul 9 20:02:50 2015 UTC,Anything is better then the current shit show
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,cloud_28,2,Thu Jul 9 03:58:53 2015 UTC,I can see why people would want to try this but it just wouldn't work.  Dickey's issues have mostly been control problems lately.  Imagine him coming in with a wonky knuckler and walking the bases loaded late in a game.
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,sonicreducer10,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:08:27 2015 UTC,That would be preferable to him loading the bases and forcing him to pitch through it with a wonky knuckler.  If he's in relief and walks the first two batters then you immediately go to Osuna or Schultz or Delabar to shut it down. And you let RA try again tomorrow. If he has a bad knuckleball it's better than he be pulled after 2 batters then forcing him to face ~30 as happened last start.   “I just didn’t have a real good feel for it today. It was probably one of the worst knuckleballs I’ve had all year. I was just trying to play with them with speeds and do the best I could to pitch around a bad knuckleball and that’s hard to do. You kind of feel naked out there when that’s your main pitch and you’re not getting the movement you hope to get on it.   Pitchers with control problems should absolutely go to the pen.
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,ExplainsSocialEnigma,2,Thu Jul 9 05:45:08 2015 UTC,"A neat idea. I think they did something like that in Tampa because of the injuries, but with Dickey it could be a worthwhile experiment. Bring in a guy like Hendricks for the first couple of innings, then let Dickey pitch through the 7th or 8th. Osuna closes. I'd do it once to see how it works. Would have to mess with the batters' timing, right?"
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,westtexasforever,4,Thu Jul 9 13:06:37 2015 UTC,Just remember Mike Wilner still will argue that Dickey is really good and us Jays fans just don't know what a good pitcher is when we see one.... That guy is the worst.
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,kapacj,4,Thu Jul 9 20:21:27 2015 UTC,"Wilner or Dickey? He's not wrong, Dickey was really good in June, and only has one bad start this month."
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,westtexasforever,0,Sat Jul 11 20:31:11 2015 UTC,"Dickey is bad and Wilner is a goof. He always says ""Calm down we have 89 games left, the Jays are only 3 games back"" Dude games the Jays should win add those all up and at the end of the year that is why the Jays are 8 games out of a playoff spot. He just tries to spin a positive message on everything but you need to realize the Jays have not played a meaningful game in over 21 years that is completely unacceptable."
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,kapacj,7,Thu Jul 9 15:58:49 2015 UTC,"They haven't played a playoff game in that long, but they've played meaningful games where they've been right in the race, even late in the season.   Dickey had a bad 2 months, and then rebounded with a great month of June. He's not a bad pitcher."
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,westtexasforever,-3,Thu Jul 9 17:39:13 2015 UTC,"Dickey is a terrible pitcher. Here are some stats to prove you wrong.  Turning 41 years old  Career 4.05 ERA, decent  Walks nearly 3 runners per game  Gives up 1 home run per game  1.3 WHIP terrible  He is garbage, he prays that a MAGIC TRICK works against big leauge hitters. This trade with the Mets will honestly go down as 2nd worst trade in Jays history. Michael Young will go down as the worst trade."
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,kapacj,6,Thu Jul 9 17:42:23 2015 UTC,"The numbers don't prove me wrong at all.   Turning 41   Being 41 makes him bad? What does age have to do with performance? If he's performing well, he's performing well.   Career ERA   A pretty solid career ERA makes him terrible?   Walks nearly 3 per game, gives up 1 HR game, 1.3 WHIP   Not at all bad for a starting pitcher. League average this season for BB/9 and HR/9 for this season and 2.86 and .96 respectively. League average WHIP is 1.28."
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,westtexasforever,-2,Thu Jul 9 17:43:50 2015 UTC,"41 years old vs a catcher and pitcher traded away in their early 20's = fail.  A sub 3.50 ERA should be the quality he puts out given his money and what the Jays traded away.  I bet you're the type of guy that thought JP Arencibia was going to be a stud. All I am trying to say is Dickey is garbage, he is a 200 inning guy year after year... that is great he still sucks."
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,kapacj,5,Thu Jul 9 17:49:57 2015 UTC,"JP Arencibia was one of the top prospects in baseball- some of the best minds in baseball thought he was going to be a stud. Obviously its easy to disagree with that in hindsight. Dickey doesn't suck at all. He's not an ace, or even a number 2 pitcher. He's a mid-back rotation starter with a reasonable salary (despite what you think) who will pitch 200 innings every season. That is far from being a terrible pitcher as you claim.  Once again, easy to not like the trade in hindsight. But at the time, they were trading for a guy who had just won the Cy Young award. D'Arnaud has spent TONS of time on the DL since the trade, and Syndergaard is only just now up in the majors. In that time, Dickey has been a valuable contributor on this team."
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,westtexasforever,0,Thu Jul 9 17:58:00 2015 UTC,"However Dickey pitched in a ballpark the size of Texas so those Cy Young numbers were not legit. Synd will be a stud for more years than Dickey was a stud (1.5 seasons) because just like you said Dickey is a mid rotation guy, not worth the trade. AA was basically a kid that the parents let go wild in the candy store and he blew his load on cotton candy and lost all his teeth on this trade."
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,kapacj,2,Thu Jul 9 18:03:44 2015 UTC,"xFIP of 3.27 in 2012, still very very good. Sure the parked helped somewhat (although you're overstating it), but he was coming off of a solid 3 years. He isn't a terrible pitcher and you certainly haven't provided any evidence at all that suggests he is.  You don't know that- prospects bust all the time. Not only that, but teams trade prospects all the time for pieces that can help right away. AA went all in the the Marlins trade and tried to put them over the top with a Cy Young winner. It was a good strategy that other teams do all the time. It hasn't worked out, but we can't really fairly evaluate it in hindsight because AA obviously can't tell the future."
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,westtexasforever,0,Thu Jul 9 18:10:38 2015 UTC,"All this aside, if Dickey gives up less than 3 runs today over 7 innings today with no homeruns, I will send you a case of beer."
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,kapacj,3,Thu Jul 9 18:14:24 2015 UTC,Close to a case of beer there.... was a good start though

Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,cozeners,2,Thu Jul 9 18:16:42 2015 UTC,"Pretty much anything would be better than what's happening now.  Unfortunately, you can't mess with 120 year old traditions. It's their sacred baseball duty to not break the norm, otherwise they might actually innovate a new way to win games. MLB wouldn't want anything to ruin the Yankees' chances of giving them great ratings and revenue down the stretch.  As a side point here, I remember Tony La Russa going with a ""starters by committee"" thing some time in the early to mid-90s, I believe, for Oakland. I might be wrong on the timing, can't remember when he left Oakland. But he was basically pitching 2-3 guys in the first 6-7 innings intentionally, with no real ""starter"". I wish I knew what year that was, I'd like to see how successful it turned out."
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,allirow,2,Thu Jul 9 20:14:52 2015 UTC,The Rays also did when they were the Devil Rays.  It did not work out very well.
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,ExplainsSocialEnigma,2,Thu Jul 9 18:23:10 2015 UTC,"They're doing a very similar thing right now and it's working out very well.  Their starting pitchers pitch the fewest innings in the majors but are among the most successful. It's exactly what every team with a weak rotation should be doing.  Let your few legitimately good starters go deep, but pull all the weak ones after about 18 batters. Keep an 8-man bullpen if you need to. Let many of your reliever pitch 4+ outs per appearance. See success. The Royals have learned to do it too."
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,gustamos,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:53:35 2015 UTC,"Didn't read the link, but I'd assume that would only work if you have a good bullpen?"
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:14:20 2015 UTC,"A good bullpen is ideal, but it still works with a replacement-level bullpen. Because even a crappy bullpen is better than a tired, crappy starter that the batters have gotten used to.  The only time it doesn't really work is when your starters are all great and your bullpen sucks. But in that case you don't really need a deep bullpen anyway."

Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,ColdStoryBro,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:27:44 2015 UTC,"Wakefield's numbers aren't astounding (he was playing on a stacked team). When he had aged to the point Dickey is he was worse than mediocre. Below average WHIP, below average walk rate. Decent strikeouts count but he still gave up a decent number of runs. He was backed up by doubles hitters and power hitters that gave him wins like hutch is now. I know nothing of Charlie Hough but it seem like after 40 his numbers came out worse. Increased walks and ER. Age is an important factor here because it will give you a relative sense of how much arm strength the pitcher would have. Overpowering hard movement and control is lost."
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,WayneM70,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:53:59 2015 UTC,Yes because we all know Knuckleballers really rely on that overpowering hard movement and control....
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,ColdStoryBro,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:56:02 2015 UTC,"Dickey won the Cy young when he was throwing a harder knuckleball (see here) and had much better control (see walk rate 2.1 BB/9 as opposed to 3.1 this season, he also hit his spots frequently as he gave up 0.9 HR9 as opposed to 1.3 HR9 this season). I don't know if you're trolling right now."
Torontobluejays,3cmrtj,AnnalisaPetrucci,0,Sat Jul 11 06:26:17 2015 UTC,"I think the only issue with this is you're likely burning through pen arms too quickly then.   I absolutely hate Dickey but he's reliable enough to rest an already shitty bullpen due to the fact of his pitching abilities. You can at least leave Dickey in a game to get rocked to shit worst case scenario and not worry about fatigue. If we had more reliable arms in the starting rotation instead of Drew ""Jekyl & Hyde"" Hutchinson and the revolving circus of a 5th starter then it seems highly beneficial... sadly the Jays don't have that.  At least there's ol' reliable Marky."

The fact is, if (for example) Cincinatti is going to give up Cueto, they're going to give him to the highest bidder. Nothing AA says is going to change that. Unless he ponies up the prospects or another decent trade chip, he's getting nothing. And if the Yankees pony up, then they get him. It's that simple. Don't be taken in by Rogers media spin."

Torontobluejays,3cmo3n,kapacj,0,Fri Jul 10 05:48:14 2015 UTC,The fact that anyone thinks that stuff said in the media is going to affect trades is the biggest pot-smoking-induced garbage I've ever heard.

Torontobluejays,3cmo3n,kapacj,0,Fri Jul 10 15:47:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and all he would have to say is ""I was just kidding"" and he gets his desperation removed. Again, there is no way anything said in the media by a GM is going to change how much Cincinnati gets for Cueto (or whoever).  For example: Let's say AA is downplaying rentals (like he currently is). And let's say the Yankees are also looking for a rental like Cueto. Do you honestly think Cincinnati is going to say ""Hmmm, AA told the media that he doesn't want rentals. I guess we won't ask him for much here. I know the Yankees are looking too, but we won't even talk to them about their offer, because AA might change his mind.""  Let's get out of the absurd. Let's deal with reality.  The fact is, AA is not going to make a major deal for a real pitcher, because nobody in MLB is looking to make their team worse by giving up controlled players, and he doesn't want to ""rent"" anybody."
Torontobluejays,3cmo3n,cozeners,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:07:33 2015 UTC,"No, but if the Reds and AA are negotiating, its not like the Reds are going to say ""here's what the yankees are offering: we will accept anything better than it"".

Torontobluejays,3cmo3n,cozeners,-4,Thu Jul 9 02:30:10 2015 UTC,"Good call AA.  Let's examine this for a moment...  The last time the Blue Jays were in serious contention down the stretch was 1992 and 1993.  In '92 they picked up a ""rental"" named David Cone. He was gone the following season. Was it worth it? Absolutely. They may not have won the WS without him.  In '93 they picked up Tony Fernandez and Rickey Henderson, who would both be free agents in '94 and both were gone the following season. Rickey didn't contribute a lot in the final few months before the play-offs, but they both were huge in some key situations in the WS. It was worth it.  Those kinds of moves sell tickets and get the fans excited.  The fact that AA has no interest in making a great team even better makes me really suspicious. What exactly is going on here? Is he on the Blue Jays' side? I'm not saying he's conspiring against them, but think about it: What's the only thing this team is lacking? If they don't acquire some serious pitching, this team is done. Felix Doubront is not going to bolster this rotation. Why would a GM intentionally not make his team better if he has the ability to do so?  Yeah, he might have to give up a prospect or two. So what. In a year, a ton of other prospects will mature and come into the limelight. And let's not forget that when you lose someone to free agency, you get compensatory draft picks, so you'll still have a shot to build the farm (albeit to a small degree, but still...) Also, no prospect is guaranteed, and when was the last time this team had a dominant young pitcher? The AL East is tough. They're better off with guys like Dickey and Buehrle. At least with them, you know you're getting 7-8 innings and an ERA no worse than 4.00 - 4.50 over the long haul.  I'm sorry, but if AA doesn't make a real move to get pitching help, then something is seriously wrong."
Torontobluejays,3cmo3n,darth-helmet,12,Thu Jul 9 06:13:24 2015 UTC,"That was also an entirely different era.  The Jays were AL East champions in 1991 and 1989, and were already fielding one of the top overall teams in baseball.  They only needed rentals for the little 'nudge'.  The Jays pitching staff doesn't need a gentle nudge, it needs a sledgehammer to the face.  Blowing the entire farm on 2 high priced rental pitchers would fuck the team over considerably for years to come.  The Jays have 3 of the top 25 prospects in baseball right now, if they're going to lose them, it better be to benefit more than the next 3 months."
Torontobluejays,3cmo3n,kapacj,3,Thu Jul 9 11:37:35 2015 UTC,This is exactly right. The Jays may not even make the play offs with the team they have now so giving away the farm for rentals is crazy because it's risky. That's only something you do when you're in the conversation as one of the favourites to win and want to go for it all.
Torontobluejays,3cmo3n,badass_unicorn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:47:41 2015 UTC,"I'm okay blowing the farm for someone with more control, like when the Tigers got Price,or the Royals got Shields.  If we're getting a rental, it should be mid-grade like Samardzjia or Kennedy."

Torontobluejays,3cmo3n,cbarone1,2,Thu Jul 9 14:40:23 2015 UTC,"They aren't. To be eligible for comp, a player must be with the club for an entire season. Being traded midway disqualifies the team from receiving a comp pick."
Torontobluejays,3cmo3n,alaudet,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:55:59 2015 UTC,You know that you don't get a compensation pick for a rental right.
Torontobluejays,3cmo3n,rustyarrowhead,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:43:36 2015 UTC,"He said it's the last aisle that he'd want to shop in, not that he wouldn't do it. And he's right. The first option should be finding someone that is under team control beyond the end of the season. The last option should be someone that is a near guarantee to leave after the season ends. Sure, a rental could help us, but it doesn't guarantee anything. You bring up how it worked in our favor in '92 and '93, but there are myriads of examples that you can't point to where it did not work. Hell, you had three rental starters go to one team just last year, and that didn't get them out of the play-in game.   Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I don't think anyone is against him getting a rental player, even if they have to pay a premium, but it needs to be the right guy (not just to appease the masses), and after all other avenues have been explored."
Torontobluejays,3cmo3n,K-mag,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:28:38 2015 UTC,A deal needs two sides.  There are so many teams still in it right now nobody is moving.  It will get interesting nearer the end of July.  The AL East has all 5 teams still in it for example.  If you are selling you are waiting for teams to compete for your resources.  Let's judge AA on August 1st.
Torontobluejays,3cmo3n,rustyarrowhead,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:01:04 2015 UTC,"if a player is lost to free agency after being dealt in the final year of their contract, there is no compensatory pick awarded. this is just another argument against rental players. even if you did get one, you're giving up top 25 talent and getting a sandwich pick.  the reality is, we need established talent with control (hell, even serviceable talent) as Buehrle and Dickey come off the books. next year, we'll be staring down a rotation of Hutch, Norris, Sanchez, maybe Estrada, and then we have to go after someone in the FA market (which is far from a guaranteed acquisition) or alternatively rush/convert an internal option to the rotation. if AA can make a move to help the club now and still maintain control for the next couple of years, he would far prefer to make that trade (even if it's not for the elite level ace). at least then, if we don't make the playoffs, we have pieces moving into next year that can really keep us competitive by buoying our rotation."

Torontobluejays,3cmo3n,cozeners,0,Thu Jul 9 18:39:25 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify: They get compensation if a qualifying offer is made, so I wasn't completely wrong. That's the new rule."
Torontobluejays,3cmo3n,rustyarrowhead,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:45:02 2015 UTC,"no I'm fairly certain that's incorrect unless they made a change to the rules before the start of this season. if a player is traded before the deadline, no qualifying offer (and thus no compensation pick) is available to the receiving team."

Torontobluejays,3cmo3n,kapacj,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:09:17 2015 UTC,"Only players who played the entire previous season with the same club can be extended a qualifying offer. For example, the A's cannot submit one to Jon Lester because they acquired him at the trade deadline."

I'm not saying he's conspiring against them, but think about it:    First off, I have to say that this is just completely ridiculous. I normally dislike your comments and attitude around here, but these two are just absurd.   Second, if you get a rental player and they become a free agent, you do not get a comp pick, so you're wrong about that. Also the last time we had a dominant young pitcher was last year, and he is currently rehabbing his knee and furthering his education at Duke University!"
Torontobluejays,3cmo3n,cozeners,0,Fri Jul 10 05:52:08 2015 UTC,"The rule was changed about comp picks:   Starting with the 2013 draft, free agents are no longer classified by ""type"". Instead, a team is only able to receive compensation if it makes its former player an offer at least equal to the average of the 125 richest contracts.   So I wasn't wrong about receiving compensation. I was simply going by the older rules, which I had forgotten had changed. But they can still get something if they make a qualifying offer, which isn't unreasonable for a top-tier player.  As for Marcus Stroman, Do you consider 2 months of good pitching to be ""dominant""? His ERA on August 22 last season was 4.11. How is that ""dominant"" exactly?"
Torontobluejays,3cmo3n,kapacj,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:40:33 2015 UTC,"No they can't get anything if they make a qualifying offer. The player has to be with them the entire season. And he wasn't great out of the bullpen, but he was unreal once he started starting for us."
Torontobluejays,3cmo3n,cozeners,0,Fri Jul 10 15:49:03 2015 UTC,"Ok, I believe you about the full season, but that Wiki article doesn't seem to say that...? Can you provide a reference?  I'm sorry but Marcus Stroman has proven very little at the Major League level. If you want to live in a pipe dream where he's won the Cy Young before he's even had 2 good months in MLB, then go ahead. I'll deal with reality and wait until he actually does something significant. Remember Ricky Romero and Brandon Morrow, supposedly two of the most ""dominant"" young pitchers on our team. And now they're both on the scrap heap."

Torontobluejays,3ckhe3,mzerol,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:06:38 2015 UTC,I thought Goins did a good job filling in when Travis was out.
Torontobluejays,3ckhe3,stman4,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:37:09 2015 UTC,"Dickey has zero value, even if the Jays ate some of his contract. He's a well-below-average starting pitcher at this point. Nobody will want him   pitching for them down the stretch. If they trade Pillar they'll have a hole in centrefield. If Pompey were up and doing okay, it would be a different story.  Trading Edwin actually could make sense because of the team's 1B/DH logjam, but he has 10 and 5 rights and would likely block a deal. I don't really see anyone on the current roster being a good trade candidate."
Torontobluejays,3ckhe3,Ferivich,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:13:59 2015 UTC,"Dickey by himself has zero trade value. For a team to eat the remainder of this year to unload a player or two and say get Norris, Hoffman, Dwight Smith Jr, Dan Jensen + + teams would do that."
Torontobluejays,3ckhe3,basas22,5,Thu Jul 9 19:01:55 2015 UTC,"Hopefully nobody. The Jays have more than enough prospect depth to get a deal done, so there is no reason to trade anyone off of the 25 man roster. I just don't want to be the A's 2.0 from last year who scored tons  of runs until they traded Cespedes."
Torontobluejays,3ckhe3,Cock-PushUps,9,Wed Jul 8 17:16:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, other than Navarro please trade no one in the starting line-up. The team has good stuff going for them and I hate when one piece gets removed it could throw it outta synch a-la Cespedes last year"
Torontobluejays,3ckhe3,ilikehockey2,3,Wed Jul 8 16:55:58 2015 UTC,"I think Colabello is pretty tradeable, we can fill that void with Smoak / Valencia."

Torontobluejays,3ckhe3,hoytaylo,10,Thu Jul 9 02:34:10 2015 UTC,"My guess is Edwin Encarnacion given he has 1 year of control left at a very affordable rate, with tons of power. If a move were made, I'd like to use the Cespedes for Lester trade as a comparable.  I don't think Colabello or Navarro get something done, and i'm starting to think Pillar is more valuable to us than any other team."
Torontobluejays,3ckhe3,ExplainsSocialEnigma,13,Wed Jul 8 16:48:50 2015 UTC,"edwin has 10/5 rights, no way he is accepting a trade to a team not in the race"
Torontobluejays,3ckhe3,hoytaylo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:53:33 2015 UTC,He wouldn't be going to a non-contender most likely.  A bat like EE would likely be sent to someone like the Mets in a three-way trade where the Mets send prospects to someone like Cincinatti and we get a pitcher.  I still don't really like it though unless we're really bullish on the Smoak/Colabello/Valencia triumvirate.
Torontobluejays,3ckhe3,allirow,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:50:50 2015 UTC,"why would EE waive his rights to go to the NL, it's in his best interests to stay in the AL (pref a hitter friendly park) with DH to ensure he produces and can command a big contract next time he hits FA (like V. Martinez). You can only look at this situation from the perspective of EE, he has to totally be gaining from the trade in order to waive his rights"
Torontobluejays,3ckhe3,CNDNFighter,3,Wed Jul 8 23:20:01 2015 UTC,Pillars value is tough to gauge.  I think a team may want him as part of a package or something.  If he keeps this up next season then he could have some Rasmus level of value.
Torontobluejays,3ckhe3,stolarz88,2,Wed Jul 8 18:05:23 2015 UTC,"My guess is Edwin Encarnacion given he has 1 year of control left at a very affordable rate   IMO, this isn't particularly likely as he does hold 10/5.    I don't think Colabello or Navarro get something done, and i'm starting to think Pillar is more valuable to us than any other team.   Agree entirely and I have similar feelings on Colabello as Pillar.  I do however think that Navarro is an excellent complimentary piece to a trade. He is good enough to be starting behind the plate on about half the league's teams, and could be an attractive piece if paired with one of the young names being thrown around such as Norris or Pompey"
Torontobluejays,3ckhe3,steven_scramkos,0,Wed Jul 8 18:26:56 2015 UTC,"Definitely not.  You can't just slide him out the lineup.  I think your pieces are Colabello, Saunders, Pompey, Sanchez, Norris, Stroman, Castro, Osuna  I don't think Stroman is going anywhere...but he is a piece."
Torontobluejays,3ckhe3,thedudeyousee,13,Wed Jul 8 18:15:32 2015 UTC,"Osuana? you think they'd give away the only relief pitcher who has been consistent for us all year. And why do you think that EE cant be replaced for Smoak/Colabello?  *Like I would rather EE, but Smoak and Colabello have proven themselves to be more than capable this year so far."
Torontobluejays,3ckhe3,HW_Plainview,2,Wed Jul 8 18:26:22 2015 UTC,because you literally can't trade Edwin... He has 10/5 rights and therefore has a no trade clause essentially.
Torontobluejays,3ckhe3,stolarz88,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:23:24 2015 UTC,"Of course they'd give up Osuna. The only players they wouldn't trade are Stroman, Donaldson and Bautista."
Torontobluejays,3ckhe3,steven_scramkos,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:18:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, just because he's doing well does not mean he can't be traded.  That's emotional reaction to anyone doing well, but bullpen guys are the easiest to let go year after year because they usually don't sustain.  Osuna would be a high sell prospect which could be packaged to return some front of the rotation stuff.  Would you do Osuna + two Single A prospects for Samardzija?"
Torontobluejays,3ckhe3,kapacj,2,Wed Jul 8 19:38:42 2015 UTC,"Nope, I think all aspects of our pitching need work.  IT doesnt make sense to me to significantly decrease our bullpen strength and improve our starting rotation.  I think you have to look at our position players and look who is available to trade to improve our pitching.  I think EE's the guy, though apparently he can't be traded, so I would look at someone like Collabello, Navarro, Pompey, etc."
Torontobluejays,3ckhe3,drStark,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:07:34 2015 UTC,"You're getting half a season of Shark, and he hasn't even been having a good season. I wouldn't do that trade."

I don't think many major league executives are going to be fooled but his current levels of production. Saunders value can't be too high either, given that he has barely played this season. Hard to see a contending team wanting an injured player."
Torontobluejays,3ckhe3,Qwyjibo_,3,Wed Jul 8 20:33:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly seeing Reyes go wouldn't shock me, we could put Travis in that lead off spot and Goins has hit decently and defends extraordinary well. So if we can get something back for him it would be a win win as we pick up a good pitcher (hopefully) replace him for the most part, maybe lose a couple hits in the long run at the worst, and gain a shit ton of money Cuz the dude makes to damn much"
Torontobluejays,3ckhe3,But-Seriously-Though,6,Wed Jul 8 19:00:41 2015 UTC,I highly doubt it. No one is taking Reyes' contract and there isn't a competent replacement for him. Goins is awful.
Torontobluejays,3ckhe3,stman4,3,Wed Jul 8 19:15:07 2015 UTC,"Offensively he's not very good, but he's not to far below the league average for short stops and his defense is leaps and bounds ahead of Reyes at this point, I know nobody would want to take that contract though, my point was just more of me saying he's about the only starter it wouldn't bother me to see go"
Torontobluejays,3ckhe3,But-Seriously-Though,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:20:49 2015 UTC,Goins is too far below the league average. He has a 58 wRC+ and projections agree that his true-talent is around there too. The total package is sub-replacement.

Torontobluejays,3ci7x8,dickcuddle,2,Wed Jul 8 03:17:55 2015 UTC,I thought it was someone in the Jays dugout.

Torontobluejays,3ci7x8,superbad,2,Wed Jul 8 11:10:05 2015 UTC,It would have been nice in both games of this series.
Torontobluejays,3ci7x8,GracefulShutdown,6,Wed Jul 8 02:51:52 2015 UTC,"Josh Donaldson's stats vs the White Sox so far this year...  16 AB, 10 H, 3 BB, 1 HBP, 1 SF  In 5 games against the White Sox so far this year, the Jays have put up 23 runs on the White Sox. Donaldson has 11 runs scored against the White Sox this year – that’s 48% of our totals runs scored against them!  .625 AVG .667 OBP 1.813 SLG  So, all together, that’s an OPS of 2.479(!)  At what point do the Sox just start intentionally walking him every time he comes to the plate?"
Torontobluejays,3ci7x8,pg2441,0,Wed Jul 8 11:11:05 2015 UTC,Kind of funny considering they have had pretty good starting pitching over all lol
Torontobluejays,3ci7x8,hybrid3214,5,Wed Jul 8 11:12:04 2015 UTC,Jays have gotten some great pitching this series. I'd trade good pitching for high scoring games any day.

Torontobluejays,3ci9fs,Vranak,11,Wed Jul 8 02:59:28 2015 UTC,The last thing we need is Boston getting into the mix.
Torontobluejays,3ci9fs,SteroyJenkins,4,Wed Jul 8 09:24:59 2015 UTC,"I think it's already too late to deny that's happening. We wanted to count them out earlier but a 162-game season affords plenty of opportunity for miraculous turnarounds. I suspect that the Blue Jays embarrassing them on their home turf had a lot to do with it. They took those losses to heart, and shocked them out of their dysfunction."
Torontobluejays,3ci9fs,jaysrapsleafs,2,Wed Jul 8 12:29:49 2015 UTC,"It's more of a shock that they struggled so badly for so long. They have a much better team on paper and were just under performing. Still, I hate them and wish them the worst. The good news is that they can't afford to mess up."
Torontobluejays,3ci9fs,MTLBroncos,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:22:11 2015 UTC,"ayyy 2nd place! It really sucks how many games we've thrown away this year, we could easily be in first if not for these mental fuckups and terrible pitching."
Torontobluejays,3ci9fs,darrrrrren,3,Wed Jul 8 03:33:16 2015 UTC,And we could easily be way out of first if not for all the other teams playing poorly for stretches too - I'd consider us lucky so far.
Torontobluejays,3ci9fs,StealthSpheesSheip,5,Wed Jul 8 13:27:50 2015 UTC,"Every team is dealing with limitations and you try to work with the strengths that you have rather than the strengths you don't. This team is loaded up on sluggers and effective hitters and has some good pitching. It's not terrible by any stretch, and you'd be a pessimist to suggest otherwise. Mark Buerhle, Drew Hutchison, Brett Cecil, Roberto Osuna, do you really consider these to be terrible pitchers? Of course you don't. Everyone has rough or simply mediocre outings from time to time. You've got to look at the season on balance before you start wringing your hands in despair."
Torontobluejays,3ci9fs,jrad151,7,Wed Jul 8 04:16:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Cecil and Hutchison need to definitely work on it. I've been pretty disappointed in Cecil especially."

Torontobluejays,3chvsq,Youreprobablygay,11,Wed Jul 8 01:05:13 2015 UTC,"What's your price range? Renaissance is in the dome, never stayed there though.  $150ish Lord Strathcona is near York and Wellington, a 10 min walk from the dome and fairly close to union station. Haven't been there in about 10 years, so can't say about their current rooms but it was nice when I was there.  $200ish a night is the Hyatt regency on king, just a short walk straight up blue jay way from the dome. Nice rooms, Starbucks downstairs. Self park is $35 a night in an underground lot just below the hotel.  $300+ a night is Hotel Le Germain Toronto on Mercer st, a half block closer to the dome than the Hyatt. Very nice, higher end hotel, however it's been about 6-7 years since their last renovation so some things are a little ""long in the tooth"" not bad or off putting, but might make you think it's not worth the expense. Friendly staff and valet parking for $25 a night I think? Free Granny Smith apples all over the hotel.  Hope that helps!"

I love the service, they're friendly and it's a small hotel so you don't feel like a customer, you feel like a guest. Sounds cheesy but it's the best way I can describe it. They also have a self serve cappuccino machine downstairs in the lobby, pretty good for when you want some caffeine at an ungodly hour. It's also a cool area to sit and relax. Books and reading materials and comfy chairs!"
Torontobluejays,3chvsq,goatamousprice,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:12:22 2015 UTC,Appreciate that insight. Would this hotel be near the nightlife as well? Sorry I'm very unfamiliar with the city of Toronto :/
Torontobluejays,3chvsq,goatamousprice,3,Wed Jul 8 01:48:16 2015 UTC,"It's right in the heart of it. Steps from the TIFF Bell Lightbox ,Roy Thomson Hall, Second City, and the clubs on King st. And even if it we're a bit further, when you're downtown in Toronto you're never more than a short subway/streetcar ride from any big attraction/event. I hope you like Toronto when you visit, I know I love living here."

Torontobluejays,3chvsq,imtoocoldforthisshit,3,Wed Jul 8 02:52:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, most of these places recommended are in the heart of downtown and that's where a lot of the nightlife is. King, Adelaide, Queen st. is very popular at night.   I've noticed that no one has mention the Ritz Carlton yet either. It's at Blue Jays Way and Wellington, easy 5 minute walk to the stadium, and, being it's a Ritz chain so of course it's nice. Also there's a cheap enough breakfast place right next door to (Sunset Grill) which is fairly convenient for hangovers, or a Cora's around the corner"
Torontobluejays,3chvsq,MeIIowJeIIo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:55:49 2015 UTC,"Was looking at the ritz before, that 500+$ a night price tag is a little steep but usually worth it.. All I know is I'm more confused now than when I began looking for a hotel haha! Thank you for your help though"

Torontobluejays,3ch1ch,hoytaylo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:37:45 2015 UTC,I'm thinking he plays out his contract in Toronto then. He is far more valuable in a hitter friendly park like skydome.
Torontobluejays,3ch1ch,Dru12,2,Wed Jul 8 02:38:49 2015 UTC,Wouldn't mind trading Edwin for some good starting pitching
Torontobluejays,3ch1ch,ad19,0,Wed Jul 8 02:40:52 2015 UTC,"Wow, we really need to start throwing in Goins in the 9th. Reyes looked like he was using a walker on that!"
Torontobluejays,3ch1ch,silentfuryx,-1,Wed Jul 8 02:36:17 2015 UTC,I agree. There is no reason to keep Reyes in right now.
Torontobluejays,3ch1ch,gigglingtin,2,Wed Jul 8 02:35:17 2015 UTC,seriously? come on man
Torontobluejays,3ch1ch,hoytaylo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:37:16 2015 UTC,Why don't you explain why you think this is a bad idea?
Torontobluejays,3ch1ch,gigglingtin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:36:51 2015 UTC,"first off my comment was in regard to 'walker' it was a bang bang play. Second - Gibbons ""benching"" a former All-Star would have a detrimental affect on 1) Reyes' ego (you'd be an idiot to argue otherwise), which 2) will affect the team clubhouse chemistry (lets be honest, this would be a huge problem, last years problems have been well documented after the deadline and so on)"
Torontobluejays,3ch1ch,hoytaylo,0,Wed Jul 8 02:46:26 2015 UTC,"Reyes is a professional, if benching him in favor of a defensive improvement is what's best for the team then he'll accept it. Also, if you can show me any sort of proof that suggests team chemistry had any impact at all on winning ball games I'd love to see it."
Torontobluejays,3ch1ch,Brizzyce,2,Wed Jul 8 02:49:01 2015 UTC,"It just makes sense.  You have a way better glove on the bench.  No one is saying Goins needs to start, just put him in when you are up after the 7th or something and Reyes has just batted."
Torontobluejays,3ch1ch,neverruntwice,2,Wed Jul 8 11:09:35 2015 UTC,Double play ball
Torontobluejays,3ch1ch,ad19,2,Wed Jul 8 02:40:01 2015 UTC,Okay fuck my life.

Torontobluejays,3ch1ch,thecanadiandude,2,Wed Jul 8 02:30:18 2015 UTC,Was Edwin pimping that homerun?
Torontobluejays,3ch1ch,BettyWhiteOnSteroids,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:30:16 2015 UTC,Doesn't look like it. He hustled the whole way. Can't complain about that I guess.
Torontobluejays,3ch1ch,an_huge_asshole,2,Wed Jul 8 02:30:13 2015 UTC,Looks like he was running pretty hard on the replay
Torontobluejays,3ch1ch,teckhz,4,Wed Jul 8 02:33:33 2015 UTC,Did he think he hit a dinger and trotted to 1st?

Torontobluejays,3cjmgd,brownmagician,11,Wed Jul 8 12:41:32 2015 UTC,As a comp for Stroman - Yovani Gallardo blew out his knee in ST in May a few years back and returned in time for the stretch run and division series. It is absolutely feasible to have Stroman back for 3-4 starts if the club is still contending.
Torontobluejays,3cjmgd,Royal_Flush13,6,Wed Jul 8 13:19:25 2015 UTC,"Excellent comparison...similar injury, similar situation for club and player. Everybody heals up differently but Stro seems to be doing all the right things to get healthy. I loved him before but I think I love him even more after this year and he hasn't even thrown a pitch!"
Torontobluejays,3cjmgd,thursday51,3,Wed Jul 8 14:58:12 2015 UTC,I think it would be better for Stro to just come back as a reliever. If you bring I'm back as a starter he needs a much longer rehab assignment to build up his arm strength so he can even go 5-6-7 innings. He would be available to the Jays much faster as a reliever.
Torontobluejays,3cjmgd,basas22,3,Wed Jul 8 17:12:35 2015 UTC,Gallardo actually blew his may 1. Over a month after Stro did. But he only returned Sept 24th
Torontobluejays,3cjmgd,jayk10,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:18:46 2015 UTC,"http://nypost.com/2012/05/05/brewers-pitcher-tore-acl-returned-in-same-season/   Gallardo tore his right ACL during a start on May 1, 2008 and was back on the mound for the Brewers on Sept. 24 of the same season, giving up one run in four innings and striking out seven. He was less effective when he started the first game of the postseason that year"
Torontobluejays,3cjmgd,ExplainsSocialEnigma,2,Thu Jul 9 00:02:19 2015 UTC,"Well that timeline is certainly promising. Gallardo has been durable and effective his entire career otherwise, too, so it shouldnt hurt Stroman long term."
Torontobluejays,3cjmgd,Royal_Flush13,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:42:45 2015 UTC,"It is promising but I'd hesitate before applying precedential value to this. Lots of torn ACLs result in finished careers.  Let's look at Gallardo's case as something to hope for, not to rely on."

Even if he starts throwing off a mound in August, he'll need basically the same thing that Sanchez is doing right now and that takes time. If anything, he will factor in to the bullpen, in my opinion."
Torontobluejays,3cjmgd,adz92,2,Wed Jul 8 14:08:00 2015 UTC,"I agree he probably wouldn't be back as a starter, as a reliever would be nice though."

Torontobluejays,3cjmgd,Mapleleaf97,2,Wed Jul 8 14:34:47 2015 UTC,"We will not have Saunders back after the All-Star break, unless you mean anytime after the All-Star break, up to and including next season.  His current status on the Jays injury update is that he might be back in August. I wouldn't hold my breath though."
Torontobluejays,3cjmgd,Born_Ruff,2,Wed Jul 8 14:02:20 2015 UTC,"If Saunders can come back healthy and productive that will really solidify the outfield d and lengthen the line up. Saunders, Travis and Pillar is a pretty good 7-9 that could set the table well when we roll over the lineup. Stro back in September would be incredible...I'd hate to see him rush it back but if he really is healthy why not??? I'd just remember the story of another young promising star pitcher who saw his career totally unravel after a knee injury...you don't want Stro to be the next Ricky Romero just because he came back too early and made it worse."
Torontobluejays,3cjmgd,thursday51,8,Wed Jul 8 13:08:08 2015 UTC,I'd just remember the story of another young promising star pitcher who saw his career totally unravel after a knee injury   That's not why Ricky's career unraveled.
Torontobluejays,3cjmgd,Royal_Flush13,3,Wed Jul 8 13:20:11 2015 UTC,"It certain didn't help. Pitching with two bum knees is probably what contributed to his major command issues.

Torontobluejays,3cjmgd,dgapa,6,Wed Jul 8 14:27:17 2015 UTC,"The truth perhaps, that he wasn't all that good to begin with and had one-two seasons where he way over played his peripherals. He couldn't get lefties out at all, remember? Joe Madden was just the first from an opposing team to publicly announce it, it wasn't like it was some closely guarded secret.   Edit: see /u/thursday51's response about his bad knees as well."
Torontobluejays,3cjmgd,_Putin_,2,Wed Jul 8 14:42:22 2015 UTC,You make good points and I appreciate the insight. I always subscribed to the notion that he lost his self confidence but felt there was more to the story.
Torontobluejays,3cjmgd,dgapa,2,Wed Jul 8 15:19:46 2015 UTC,"It was an easy scapegoat. ""Hur dur hur he got dumped by Miss America and lost all his confidence and can't throw at all!"" Except most athletes to get to the majors (of any sport) have great mental fortitude unless something like an actual mental illness or injury strikes. It always pisses me off when people say things like they have no confidence or they don't want it bad enough, each and every person on all rosters have insane competitive drives some just manifest more outwardly than others."
Torontobluejays,3cjmgd,Royal_Flush13,2,Wed Jul 8 15:28:02 2015 UTC,"I'm willing to bet Ricky lost some confidence during his initial struggles (possibly while trying to pitch through injury) and it kind of snowballed when he couldn't get back into form - the Miss America/his personal life storyline may have contributed to some degree.  I seriously doubt he's been shitty for 3.5 straight years because of some chick, though."
Torontobluejays,3cjmgd,dgapa,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:16:39 2015 UTC,"It may have contributed, but there is more than enough evidence to show he just wasn't that good. I know narratives are fun for most people but sometimes the easiest explanation is the correct one."
Torontobluejays,3cjmgd,_Putin_,2,Wed Jul 8 17:54:43 2015 UTC,"In agreement on all points. There's a great clip of mark cuban ripping into Skip Bayless about ""not wanting it enough"".  I'm not a big sabermetrics guy so I never looked into the peripherals. It sounds like it was a combination of factors: hitters figuring him out, overplaying his peripherals, deterioration of his knees, and possibly a hit to his confidence, etc.. Makes more sense than he was heartbroken and lost his ability to pitch, after all he was dating a new supermodel a few months later.   funny cuban clip"
Torontobluejays,3cjmgd,dgapa,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:53:12 2015 UTC,"I love that video. Skip Bayless is about as big of a tool as they come by. It really was a shame because he was like able he was apart of that ""Team Unit"" thing with the Leafs (I do have a Lawrie Team Unit shirt lol). and people finally got over the whole he was picked before Tulo thing. But looking at his career already he was more successful than most 1st round draft picks will ever be, which is a crazy notion in itself."
Torontobluejays,3cjmgd,UglyMuffins,-1,Wed Jul 8 19:08:39 2015 UTC,"Saunders having coming back 100% isn't even 100%. A chunk of his knee is missing.  No more power, no more speed, no more defense. He's done."
Torontobluejays,3cjmgd,dgapa,3,Wed Jul 8 14:33:30 2015 UTC,Glad to know you have a crystal ball. So did the Jays end up beating the Cardinals in the WS or did the ghost of Wainwright come back to haunt them?
Torontobluejays,3cjmgd,Vordermark,2,Wed Jul 8 15:30:16 2015 UTC,Curses to that Wainwright ghost.
Torontobluejays,3cjmgd,dgapa,2,Wed Jul 8 18:58:15 2015 UTC,But he haunts people the right (wright?) way.
Torontobluejays,3cfq5h,adz92,10,Tue Jul 7 15:44:03 2015 UTC,"I have no confidence in what the Blue Jays training staff tells us about injuries.  How they handled Sanchez is the greatest example.  Here's how it went down:  ""Oh he's just a little sore, if it were the playoffs we wouldn't skip his start.""  ""Yeah turns out he's going to miss one more start, just to be safe.  We won't put him on the DL though.""  ""Actually just kidding, we're putting him on the DL.  Shouldn't be too long though, rehab assignment unnecessary.""  ""Hmmm turns out he's been out over a month, he'll need a rehab assignment after all.""  It was the same song and dance with Travis and Reyes earlier this year.  Bautista was the only guy who actually managed to avoid the DL."
Torontobluejays,3cfq5h,dcmcderm,6,Tue Jul 7 22:24:14 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but do you realize how difficult it is to know how long an injury is going to affect someone? They could have been telling the truth every step of the way based on what they knew and how he was responding to treatment. I don't deny that there is some latent mistrust in their training staff over how things have gone the last few years, but I'm not willing to chalk it up to incompetence or chicanery quite yet."

After that it was downhill. It was always maybes and more maybes.  I guess they try to avoid the DL if at all possible, but he's been out for over a month after being ""sore"". Tell me how nobody thought anything of this when it first occured."

Torontobluejays,3cfpu1,_Putin_,10,Tue Jul 7 15:41:47 2015 UTC,"I don't see a huge market for a catcher who ideally is a back up that faces LHP. He's below average against RHP, is a horrendous pitch framer and has a noodle of an arm.  With that being said he has value in that he is a switch hitter, calls a good game, does handle LHP and is relatively  cheap for the rest of the season."
Torontobluejays,3cfpu1,Ferivich,5,Tue Jul 7 16:57:59 2015 UTC,That's why I'd think he's worth more in our lineup than whatever trade value he may garner.
Torontobluejays,3cfpu1,tetrahydrocanada,3,Tue Jul 7 17:11:18 2015 UTC,I like him in the line up if he's not taking at bats away from Smoak as a DH against RHP or from Valencia as a DH against LHP. Keep him as a catcher who plays 2/7 games.
Torontobluejays,3cfpu1,Ferivich,3,Tue Jul 7 19:35:35 2015 UTC,jays shouldn't trade navarro
Torontobluejays,3cfpu1,dickcuddle,2,Tue Jul 7 23:59:22 2015 UTC,"Not now anyway. The time to do it was at the beginning of the season when his good year last season was fresh in everybody's mind. That being said, if AA gets a solid offer, even a good loogy or reliable 7th inning guy I'd pull the trigger for sure. I just don't see that offer coming. Navarro probably has far more value to the Jays as a spot backup and insurance policy than any reliever that would be offered in a trade."
Torontobluejays,3cfpu1,thursday51,2,Wed Jul 8 01:05:29 2015 UTC,"Reds lost Mesoraco for the season, I'd say we could have a chance for a possible deal with one of their arms. If we could throw in a prospect and/or some cash, I say its viable. Red Sox, Diamondbacks are also dealing with injured catchers and the ones active now aren't doing so well either."
Torontobluejays,3cfpu1,Jacked_Veiny_Balls,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:06:17 2015 UTC,I'd love to see it happen and Navarro plus a comparable pitching prospect might be a good place to start talks.

Doubront pitched out of the bullpen in the postseason, earning his first career postseason victory in Game 4 of the 2013 World Series."
Torontobluejays,3cg4bu,mmss,-2,Wed Jul 8 01:19:01 2015 UTC,All the ring means is that he played for a good team.
Torontobluejays,3cg4bu,kapacj,-7,Tue Jul 7 21:16:05 2015 UTC,"He's never been that good. ""Solid"" is his descriptor on a good day. He's been cromulent to worse for most of his career, which is your typical #5 starter I suppose."
Torontobluejays,3cg4bu,Royal_Flush13,6,Tue Jul 7 17:40:03 2015 UTC,"Solid starters are a bargain at any price. Look at the rotation in 2013, just a year and a half ago:    Main guys (Dickey, Buehrle, Johnson, Happ, Morrow): 111 starts Backup guys (Rogers, Redmond): 34 starts   Then you have:   Chien-Ming Wang, 6 starts Ramon Ortiz, 4 starts Chad Jenkins, 3 starts Ricky Romero, 2 starts Aaron Laffey, 1 start Sean Nolin, 1 start   That's 17 starts that could have gone to a ""solid"" guy. I realize that 2013 is a tough example since only two pitchers exceeded 20 starts, but the point is that ""solid"" can mean a lot to a team. A couple of injuries hit and suddenly that AAAA guy on waivers last week looks a whole lot better. Even if Doubront comes out tonight and gets shelled, it was still a good move to sign him and give him a shot to succeed, especially after he has put up good numbers in Buffalo."
Torontobluejays,3cg4bu,mmss,0,Tue Jul 7 17:52:37 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree the org needs SP depth and I'm more confident in Doubront that those six in 2013 (shudder).  I just wouldn't call a career 87 ERA+ ""solid"". Very much the definition of a #5, which I guess is what he was always supposed to be in Boston anyhow."
Torontobluejays,3cg4bu,Royal_Flush13,2,Tue Jul 7 18:07:32 2015 UTC,That's what I mean though. You won't win a world series with five #5s but you also can't win with a couple of #2s and five AAAAs. If he is a solid #5 who can come out every five days and get into the fifth inning or better then he should be here to stay.

Torontobluejays,3cf9cj,mtrnka,5,Tue Jul 7 13:30:15 2015 UTC,Is Frasor the human rain delay? Or is that some other jays pitcher I am thinking of?
Torontobluejays,3cf9cj,chocturtle,3,Tue Jul 7 15:20:19 2015 UTC,That is Frasor
Torontobluejays,3cf9cj,maytag87,3,Tue Jul 7 15:47:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly, don't know enough about your bullpen this year, but if it's weak he wouldn't be a bad pickup.  His era is low but only because he seemed to be good at getting out of jams he would create for himself.  Whip is something like 1.6 and batters are hitting an ops above .750 against him."
Torontobluejays,3cf9cj,shreds29,0,Tue Jul 7 22:29:36 2015 UTC,You mean the ERA of 1.54?
Torontobluejays,3cf9cj,kapacj,3,Tue Jul 7 13:50:53 2015 UTC,Look at his WHIP. It's higher than his ERA! 15 walks in 23 innings pitched.
Torontobluejays,3cf9cj,supersyllable,6,Tue Jul 7 14:56:12 2015 UTC,All of his peripheral stats indicate that his ERA is unsustainable. He's been more lucky this year than good.
Torontobluejays,3cf9cj,gajarga,2,Tue Jul 7 15:01:14 2015 UTC,So? He literally costs you nothing. Nothing at all. Pick him up and see if some of that luck can continue. If not you DFA him and hopefully he clears and you have some depth in the minors.

Torontobluejays,3cf9cj,bmac901,0,Tue Jul 7 21:13:17 2015 UTC,answered pretty much the same question to someone else.
Torontobluejays,3cf9cj,kapacj,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:36:07 2015 UTC,So you want Danny Valencia to be the back up shortstop??
Torontobluejays,3cf9cj,jayk10,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:57:21 2015 UTC,So you don't think we need a plus defensive replacement at SS or 2B (who can also play OF) over a lucky reliever that is destined to regress? Especially since he wouldn't have someone like Goins backing him up in later innings.
Torontobluejays,3cf9cj,bmac901,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:32:21 2015 UTC,"I'll admit it isn't an ideal situation, but I think this team needs pitching above all else."
Torontobluejays,3cf9cj,kapacj,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:08:27 2015 UTC,"He's free- with relievers, more is better because of how unpredictable their performance is."
Torontobluejays,3cf9cj,kapacj,0,Wed Jul 8 03:54:28 2015 UTC,"I send down Ryan Goins because we don't need him, and Frasor is probably a guy you only use for a week or two to eat some innings before DFAing, unless he performs well. At that time you could DFA Frasor, or send down a different reliever if they aren't performing well."
Torontobluejays,3cf9cj,kapacj,2,Tue Jul 7 15:25:24 2015 UTC,"No no no no...Goins has been playing well, he is by far the best back up middle infielder we have on the roster and has lots of value as a late inning defensive sub (seriously...we probably win last night if he comes out for the 8th) and he runs well. Who is going to spell Reyes if we send down Goins?"
Torontobluejays,3cf9cj,thursday51,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:14:03 2015 UTC,"He has a wRC+ of 59. I like Goins because of his defence, but he is a terrible hitter. A borderline MLB player at best."
Torontobluejays,3cf9cj,kapacj,2,Tue Jul 7 21:40:34 2015 UTC,"If he was a corner outfielder that would be atrocious. As a middle infielder it's bad but with the defense he plays it's passable...especially for a defensive specialist. Jose Reyes is a great offensive SS but even he rates a wRC+ of around 90. It's silly to use a stat like runs created for a defense first player. How about we look at DRS...in only 240 innings at SS he has saved 5 runs, better than anybody else in the AL by a healthy chunk. In 3 seasons, as a part time player, he has saved our pitching staff 23 runs as a middle infielder. That's definitely worth hanging on to."
Torontobluejays,3cf9cj,thursday51,0,Tue Jul 7 21:56:25 2015 UTC,"He has a wRC+ of 88 for this season, but has been a much better offensive player than that over the course of career. It seems likely that his offensive will go up closer towards his career norms as the season progresses.   Ryan Goins is a great defensive player- no doubt about it. But basically all defensive stats need a larger sample size to properly evaluate the players talent. Fangraphs recommends at least 3 full seasons IIRC. So while his DRS numbers from this season (and others) are certainly impressive, its difficult to say that those numbers properly measure his value to the club.  Its not a silly stat to use wRC+ for a defence first player because his hitting ability still matters. You can't just ignore what is arguably the most important talent for a big league player to have- namely hitting ability.  And just my opinion, but a wRC+ that low is maybe passable for a guy that comes off the bench late in games for a defensive replacement. But if he's only playing an inning or two every few nights, its hard to imagine that he could contribute to the team in a meaningful way, despite his defence."
Torontobluejays,3cf9cj,kapacj,2,Wed Jul 8 01:39:57 2015 UTC,Don't be fooled by his ERA. That's mostly a result of stellar KC defense and lots of luck.  Take a look at his peripherals. He's been not good at all
Torontobluejays,3cf9cj,maytag87,0,Wed Jul 8 03:52:24 2015 UTC,please stop using ERA. This isn't 2000
Torontobluejays,3cf9cj,UglyMuffins,2,Wed Jul 8 04:18:38 2015 UTC,"ERA is still a useful stat. It isn't comparable to say- RBIs. There are lots of pitchers who regularly over perform or under perform when compared to their peripherals. I'm not saying his ERA reflects the kind of pitcher he is, and I'm not even saying he's good. But a waiver claim literally costs you nothing, and could at very least be useful as a guy who can eat a few innings. Worst case scenario is you DFA him and he gets claimed and you haven't lost a thing."
Torontobluejays,3cf9cj,kapacj,0,Wed Jul 8 04:54:53 2015 UTC,You're seriously using ERA to justify picking up an RP?

Torontobluejays,3cf9cj,jeremyirons911,-1,Tue Jul 7 15:00:39 2015 UTC,"When a player gets DFA'd, the reason is often tied to their performance."
Torontobluejays,3cf9cj,jy_am,2,Wed Jul 8 01:41:10 2015 UTC,True but the Royals have a surplus of good bullpen arms. Players get dropped because they aren't going to play.
Torontobluejays,3cf9cj,Garrison_Creeker,0,Wed Jul 8 18:25:21 2015 UTC,"He's not playing because he's been shitty. My point is that if we're going to ask whether we should pick up a DFA'd player, we should look at whether they could actually add value to the team.  ""Because he's now available"" and ""because I recognize his name"" aren't good reasons for acquiring a player. It's not that hard to look up basic numbers to determine whether a player is worth a look."
Torontobluejays,3cgatv,TC1671,6,Tue Jul 7 18:07:23 2015 UTC,ground ball came to him... He wasn't on the move it was a ball where he was set up to receive it. When the ball came he failed to field it and the ball went between his legs. People are angry because it was a play you would expect a little league ball player to make and maybe he was just a bit casual with it.   He also spiked a ball a bit on a relay pass and resulted in a tag at home not working out as the ball jumped up too high.
Torontobluejays,3cgatv,thedudeyousee,10,Tue Jul 7 18:24:22 2015 UTC,"He took a ground ball, like he was 5."

Torontobluejays,3cgatv,dnovi,3,Tue Jul 7 18:36:55 2015 UTC,"The ball was going right to his glove.  He didn't necessarily miss it, he brought up his glove too early and the ball went under it."

Torontobluejays,3cdkud,herpderpgg,8,Tue Jul 7 03:21:12 2015 UTC,And the entire season went pretty much downhill from there. That win would have been 10 straight. Those kinds of errors just kill momentum so badly.

Torontobluejays,3cdkud,Hero_of_Brandon,7,Tue Jul 7 02:16:02 2015 UTC,"Jeez... that's like orthodox management. Nobody should be calling for it, it should just be done. When defense becomes substantially more important than offense (i.e. when you're up by 1 in the 8th and that spot has just come up to bat), you make the sub."
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,ExplainsSocialEnigma,11,Tue Jul 7 02:25:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, but, defensive substitutions at SS are pretty uncommon. Generally, that player is pretty dependable defensively and you'd use your bench players for more susceptible positions like 3B or the OF. Not defending Reyes though, that was not pretty."
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,randalgetsdrunk,7,Tue Jul 7 02:48:35 2015 UTC,"Maybe they're uncommon globally, but Gibbons himself did it Saturday and Reyes is not a dependable SS. He's Hanley-lite."
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,ExplainsSocialEnigma,2,Tue Jul 7 03:15:10 2015 UTC,'Tis true. With Travis back it does spare up Goins to come in the later part of the game. Wonder if you do see Reyes move position at some time in the future (like to LF similar to Hanley).

Torontobluejays,3cdkud,gandalfsnutsack,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:26:03 2015 UTC,"Ish, yeah. Toronto is the 7th-biggest metropolitan area with an MLB team but has by far the biggest media market. Rogers has exclusive rights over a 35M-person market (way more than any other team) and appears to have best ratings. Jays averaged 540,000 viewers per game in 2013 whereas no American team averaged more than 185,000 households that year. The scales aren't 1:1 because the ratings reports are a bit nebulous, but even if it was 3:1 Rogers would still have the 2nd-best ratings in baseball."
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:06:00 2015 UTC,"Over his career, Jose Reyes is a .360 hitter with .910 OPS when he swings at the first pitch. You're only remembering the failures. There are some things that Reyes does that are frustrating, no doubt, but this shouldn't be one of them."
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,gajarga,0,Tue Jul 7 13:57:07 2015 UTC,"yeah that's the thing. Reyes' game has always been high-risk high-reward. If he wasn't swinging at first pitches or being aggressive on the bases people would be calling him out for that, too.   The bottom line is that we're better with him in the lineup. There's only a few shortstops in all of the league Id rather have."
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,joeap,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:40:09 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go that far. He's not nearly the offensive force he used to be, and there are a fair number of SS in the league I'd rather have. But he's definitely more valuable as a total package than Goins, even with the occasional unforced error.  But to criticize him for swinging at the first pitch is silly. In fact, given the recent tendency for pitchers to pump first-pitch strikes and get ahead in the count early, I think a lot of other hitters would be well served to take a cut on the first pitch."
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,gajarga,20,Tue Jul 7 15:04:02 2015 UTC,Fucking abortion.  Little League defensive and managerial mistakes cost the game.   Colabello can't catch a short-hop (thankfully he was excellent at the plate) and costs a run Reyes Billy Buckner's the ball (unfortunately he was not excellent at the plate) and costs 3 runs Reyes catches the relay flat-footed and fails to redeem one of the runs he already cost us Gibbons fails to put Goins in as defensive replacement for Reyes who has just batted and when we're up by 1 in the 8th Gibbons fails to call on the bullpen (probably Delabar) at any point after Reyes' first error. Buerhle was 4th-time through there and getting into trouble. Nobody who wants the Jays to win should ever make that decision - even Kershaw is less effective than Delabar 4th time through.
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,ExplainsSocialEnigma,6,Tue Jul 7 02:15:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with your last point especially, but yeah they always pinch run or remove Edwin defensively. Get Reyes out of there. He seems to get worse in late innings."
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,arterian,3,Tue Jul 7 02:18:58 2015 UTC,"This isn't even his first game-losing error. Fuck WAR: his defence has put tangible, discrete losses on the board."
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,ExplainsSocialEnigma,8,Tue Jul 7 02:27:07 2015 UTC,Way too many games like this all season.
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,ilikehockey2,2,Tue Jul 7 02:08:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't remember many games quite like this. Great pitching (8 IP 0 ER), reasonably powerful offence (2 HR) against a true Ace, and then a complete defensive meltdown."
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,ExplainsSocialEnigma,14,Tue Jul 7 02:44:42 2015 UTC,What can be said? It's the same thing every season.  We are sitting here begging for a pitcher by the end of the month to save the season but the reality is it will be too late. Of course that assumes we can even get anyone to agree to come to Canada
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,SteroyJenkins,9,Tue Jul 7 02:12:01 2015 UTC,"Of course that assumes we can even get anyone to agree to come to Canada   Luckily for Rogers, players who aren't Cole Hamels don't have a choice where they get traded."

Torontobluejays,3cdkud,ExplainsSocialEnigma,3,Tue Jul 7 02:26:02 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure all MLB teams are basically told not to make trades with the Blue Jays at the trade deadline unless the Blue Jays are in a fire sale. There's just no way that all these years they haven't been able to make a mid-season trade to put them over the top.

Torontobluejays,3cdkud,thebearjew6,4,Tue Jul 7 02:21:32 2015 UTC,"You can totally put this game on Reyes (or Gibbons for failing to put Goins). You can still love him for the games he wins us, but that was inexcusable."
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,ExplainsSocialEnigma,6,Tue Jul 7 02:50:32 2015 UTC,"You can blame him for the awful defense on that play, not for losing the entire game."
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,Qwyjibo_,5,Tue Jul 7 03:00:16 2015 UTC,"He allowed the tying and winning runs to score, made a terrible throw to allow an insurance run to score and was poor at the plate. Insofar as any position player can be blamed for losing the game, Reyes can."
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,ExplainsSocialEnigma,3,Tue Jul 7 03:13:34 2015 UTC,"The level of hatred that Jose Reyes gets is fucking ludicrious.  He made the error with ZERO outs.  It's not like his error was on the saving play of the inning.  Why not blame to Buehrle for giving up 3 straight hits after getting 2 outs, or Martin for not applying a better tag at the plate, or Pillar for shading too deep and not coming up the play faster, or fucking Gibbons not pulling Buehrle out."
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,allirow,8,Tue Jul 7 02:09:03 2015 UTC,"Seriously?  Because it was a fucking routine play. It couldn't have been a more simple play.   You don't blame Buehrle because he did his job. He got three outs. Reyes gave the sox and extra one.   You don't blame Pillar because he wasn't playing ""too shallow"" on a power hitter in Abreu. They just got lucky with a bleeder.  You don't blame Martin because Reyes made a shitty two-hop throw to home.   And you don't blame Gibbons because nobody hit a goddamned ball very hard until it was too late.  I'm not a Reyes hater. But this one is 100% on him. I'm sure he would tell you so himself."
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,toenailclipping,12,Tue Jul 7 02:22:58 2015 UTC,He just had error and misplays all game long. It wasn't just one play it was like 5/6. He just doesn't look sharp at all. Every time a ball is hit to him I wonder whether he's going to commit an error and that's fine for the first 6 innings but maybe we consider someone who can play SS late in games with leads.
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,ilikehockey2,4,Tue Jul 7 02:12:05 2015 UTC,"This is what I don't get. An error doesn't completely absolve a pitcher from responsibility. Unearned runs or not. Reyes clearly fucked up, Buehrle still gave up solid contact and maybe he shouldn't have even been in there."
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,Qwyjibo_,3,Tue Jul 7 02:15:24 2015 UTC,"No, he shouldn't have.  Gibbons should've gone to the pen after runners were on the corners."
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,allirow,2,Tue Jul 7 02:17:07 2015 UTC,"I'm on the fence about that, because Mark was pitching well, but it might have worked in this case. Bottom line: 0 earned runs."

Though now that I see this report, I suspect that Buerhle was in it come hell or high water. So, (potentially) fuck Buerhle for putting pride and sentimentally over winning.

Torontobluejays,3cdkud,TweetsInCommentsBot,3,Tue Jul 7 02:54:56 2015 UTC,"Martin didn't have a great opportunity on the play at the plate, thanks to Reyes' horrible throw. I think the amount of hate is a little much, but just like a pitcher deserves to take blame when they fall apart in an important situation, Reyes deserves some scorn when he gets the yips on a routine ground ball in an important situation. The big difference this year from years previous is that his offense just hasn't been good enough to overshadow his poor fielding."
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,cbarone1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:24:26 2015 UTC,"that's actually not a terrible throw at all. you know how middle infielders get lauded for skipping a ball to first base? same exact thing. if Martin gets two hands on that ball, it should be an out every time. look at where the bounce brings the ball - it doesn't have to be a liner to be a good throw."
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,rustyarrowhead,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:58:21 2015 UTC,"Well, for one, they normally get lauded for skipping it to first because it ""picks up speed"" off the turf, which is demonstrably false and physically impossible. For another, a throw to first only needs to be catchable, since it's a force play. It can be low or high and still be a good throw. The problem with this throw is that it bounced twice, slowing it down even more, and was still bouncing up, near the apex of the bounce when it got to Martin, forcing him to come up and get it then go tag the runner, instead of being able to come down with it in one fluid motion."
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,cbarone1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:02:17 2015 UTC,"as a catcher, you don't really want to be fielding the ball at tag level with glove only. you want it slightly higher so you can corral it and secure it before applying the tag. I didn't see the first bounce upon first review, so that does change things quite a bit (making it a poor throw) but a bounced throw isn't a terrible thing for a catcher."
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,rustyarrowhead,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:18:31 2015 UTC,"I agree that a bounced throw in and of itself isn't bad, it's where the bounce occurs that matters more than anything."
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,cbarone1,5,Tue Jul 7 14:28:20 2015 UTC,"He made the error with ZERO outs.   That's literally the most damaging time to make a bases-empty error.   Why not blame to Buehrle for giving up 3 straight hits after getting 2 outs   Because 1) I blame Gibbons because Buerhle should've been pulled once the go-ahead run got to the plate, and 2) Buerhle didn't walk anybody or allow hard contact. He allowed grounders and bloops that fell for hits. That's lucky batting moreso than bad pitching.   or fucking Gibbons not pulling Buehrle out.   Oh...   or Martin for not applying a better tag at the plate   Because it's pretty orthodox to blame the player who a) made the error who made that play possible, and b) made a shitty throw because he caught the ball wrong.   Pillar for shading too deep and not coming up the play faster   I guess you could, but it wouldn't be very persuasive. Abreu's a power hitter."
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,ExplainsSocialEnigma,-2,Tue Jul 7 02:22:43 2015 UTC,"Stop making excuses for him. He MUST get better defensively.  EDIT: Being downvoted........lol, so Reyes shouldn't get better defensively?"
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,ChillinOnTheBeach,3,Tue Jul 7 02:15:24 2015 UTC,People on here live in a different world where it is OK to consistently make routine errors and make 22 million a year. I commented on here last game about Reyes and got downvoted to hell too. You can tell the guy has talent but he mentally isn't in the game. He is paid an incredible amount of money to focus on the game and he isn't.
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,--ChaseTheAce--,2,Tue Jul 7 03:43:33 2015 UTC,"He just is who he is. He ""mustn't"" do anything, but Gibbons must recognize his weaknesses and play him appopriately. In this situation that means putting Goins in after Reyes' last at-bat. There's no earthly reason to leave Reyes in the game there."
Torontobluejays,3cdkud,ExplainsSocialEnigma,0,Tue Jul 7 03:01:00 2015 UTC,"Sure he ""should"". But he won't. He's a 32 year old SS. His defense will only get worse going forward."

Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,HW_Plainview,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:03:42 2015 UTC,Paid too much. Can hit when he's on but that's rare. Sub-par defender.  I think the basis of the Reyes hate train stems from those 3 points mainly.
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,TLKv3,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:09:47 2015 UTC,"He's a great on base guy, just not a very good shortstop sometimes. Plus 22 mill a year doesn't help."
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,AluminiumMind93,2,Tue Jul 7 02:05:40 2015 UTC,The only people worthy of playing SS are defensive replacement scrubs like Ryan Goins and John Mcdonald.
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,allirow,-1,Tue Jul 7 02:04:38 2015 UTC,I'll blame that on Both Gibbons and Reyes.
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,neverruntwice,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:02:31 2015 UTC,How can you possibly blame Gibby for that?
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,ApocAngel87,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:08:45 2015 UTC,"Only for not putting Goins into the game.  Reyes is done batting, you have a far superior glove on the bench.  Why not make use of it."
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,neverruntwice,5,Tue Jul 7 02:16:12 2015 UTC,I guess we really don't want to make the playoffs
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,fardok,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:02:08 2015 UTC,This pitching and bad defence in close games is why we are gonna finish like 5 games out of the playoffs and then remember how many games we had like this
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,SteroyJenkins,0,Tue Jul 7 02:01:55 2015 UTC,David Robertson.  We've already fucked him up once this season.
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,allirow,9,Tue Jul 7 02:01:43 2015 UTC,I love Papa Buehrle. He deserves nice things :(
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,twistedlogicx,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:01:27 2015 UTC,That wasn't really routine...
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,LeafFan13,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:00:46 2015 UTC,Tying run JBats to the plate! Time to destroy the complete game!
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,schlaBAM,2,Tue Jul 7 02:02:01 2015 UTC,Good guy Martin right there with the pat on Reyes back.
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,LDRMS,2,Tue Jul 7 02:00:23 2015 UTC,GG Buehrle as well.
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,fairfieldbordercolli,2,Tue Jul 7 02:00:15 2015 UTC,"Buerhle too. They've been playing a long time, shit happens. We as fans of course are outraged."
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,ilikehockey2,2,Tue Jul 7 02:01:30 2015 UTC,"Guys, my baseball stat iq isn't the greatest. Why are all 4 Sox runs unearned?"
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,tbonecoco,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:01:24 2015 UTC,The first run scored because of a throwing error from Bautista allowing the runner to score when he would have likely been stuck on third without the error. Jose Reyes' error should have been an out and buerhle got two more outs. So every run that scored was because buerhle needed 4 outs in the inning and in theory not his fault.
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,solojb,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:00:12 2015 UTC,Makes sense!
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,tbonecoco,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:02:07 2015 UTC,Reyes fucked a ball up. All RBIs after are unearned because if Reyes had it and got the out the inning was over.
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,TLKv3,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:03:37 2015 UTC,"If a runner reaches on an error and scores, the run is unearned."
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,fairfieldbordercolli,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:01:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that I knew. I didn't know that that error would still count for other runners."
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,tbonecoco,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:01:49 2015 UTC,"Haven't caught the whole game, but I believe it's only the final 3 runs that are unearned"
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,Don___Draper,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:05:11 2015 UTC,Commentator just said all 4. Bautista had a throwing error earlier.
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,tbonecoco,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:01:25 2015 UTC,Ah. Then that makes sense.   Basically then they were all unearned because all runs scored as the result of an error.
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,Don___Draper,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:02:20 2015 UTC,"Errors, like those committed by Jose Reyes... FUCK."

Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,infiniteken,2,Tue Jul 7 02:01:13 2015 UTC,Bautista is gonna do Bautista things
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,AwsomeOne7,6,Tue Jul 7 02:00:09 2015 UTC,"Neat, their SS can fuck up too!"
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,GracefulShutdown,2,Tue Jul 7 01:59:58 2015 UTC,"Hindsight is always 20/20, yeah yeah. But why don't we put Goins in near the end of close games? Reyes was done batting for the night anyway."
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,pdjmcvit,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:59:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed - that would've been a no-brainer. Also, Delabar should've been in for Abreu if not sooner."
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,ExplainsSocialEnigma,2,Tue Jul 7 01:59:43 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same thing about Delabar. But I still don't mind staying with Buehrle. He was pitching well.
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,cozeners,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:00:59 2015 UTC,It's pretty much always a bad call to leave in your starter in the 4th-time through the order if he's in trouble. Even Clayton Kershaw is less effective than an average reliever at that point.
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,ExplainsSocialEnigma,2,Tue Jul 7 02:04:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed. But the problem with that is, if they put Delabar in and the Sox tie the game, then everybody cries ""Why not leave Buehrle in?"" That's why I don't care either way.  What I do care about is a guy making 22 million dollars this year (holy crap, is that right!!!??) playing his position like a professional."
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,cozeners,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:06:21 2015 UTC,"if they put Delabar in and the Sox tie the game, then everybody cries ""Why not leave Buehrle in?   Eh... the smart ones don't. They know exactly why that decision was made.   What I do care about is a guy making 22 million dollars this year[1] (holy crap, is that right!!!??) playing his position like a professional.   I'm also appalled with his performance at a premium position, but I'm not so concerned about the money because 1) that's why he was available in the trade, and 2) it's Rogers' money. IDGAF, I want them to expand payroll not bitch about it."
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:16:43 2015 UTC,I loathe Reyes. He really can't hit anymore and maintains a pathetic display of defence. That contract is just the cherry on the top.
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,Insanemonkey64,2,Tue Jul 7 02:32:31 2015 UTC,FUCK YES
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,ilikehockey2,2,Tue Jul 7 01:59:40 2015 UTC,Fucking Jose Reyes.
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,BautistaBomb,3,Tue Jul 7 01:59:39 2015 UTC,Actually I'm really surprised Gibbons doesn't put Goins in when we have the lead.  Seems like a very easy decision.
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,neverruntwice,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:59:27 2015 UTC,There's ego and personality in baseball too man. It's a sticky situation. I don't see Jose taking too kindly to it but after tonight it needs to be done late in close games...
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,nnDMT420,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:59:00 2015 UTC,Well it would've been a good decision but can't say I'm not surprised
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:07:42 2015 UTC,Yeah I think so too. Even if he's hitting at the top of the order make him bunt or whatever.
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,ilikehockey2,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:01:26 2015 UTC,I know statistically we are better with Reyes there but damn does he make so many costly errors. Sometimes I wish we had Goins out there
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,ModernPoultry,3,Tue Jul 7 02:00:13 2015 UTC,"We are not statistically better with Reyes when we have a 1-run lead in the 8th, he's just batted, and Ryan Goins is on the bench.  Goins should be a no-brainer defensive replacement there."
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,ExplainsSocialEnigma,4,Tue Jul 7 01:58:58 2015 UTC,Feels like Roy Halladay syndrome tonight. What more do you want from your pitcher? Defense needs to play better if you want to win close games.
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,EndsLikeShakespeare,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:02:40 2015 UTC,Defense generally played well.
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,ilikehockey2,2,Tue Jul 7 01:58:44 2015 UTC,That was a little league error. Going to be on every misplays of a week low light reels. But we can come back. Do it jays

Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,GreenLeaf98,0,Tue Jul 7 02:02:57 2015 UTC,What? I'd rather we face the guy approaching 100 than their closer
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,s0kker,2,Tue Jul 7 01:58:38 2015 UTC,Just trade Reyes for some pitching. This guy is such an awful player in the clutch. I'm so sick of this.
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,cozeners,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:00:12 2015 UTC,No one is taking his contract. And you can't bench him or whatever because there is no competent SS in the system to replace him with.   Plus he's not a bad player...
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,Qwyjibo_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:58:11 2015 UTC,"At the very least, they need to put Goins in at short when it's a close game and they're winning in the 8th/9th inning."

Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,Ninjasquirtle4,2,Tue Jul 7 01:58:08 2015 UTC,The error is really bad but it's still the pitcher giving up all the contact afterwards.
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,Qwyjibo_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:57:58 2015 UTC,You can't expect the pitcher to strike out every batter. Solid defence in clutch situations is essential to a winning ball team.
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,stevefrench2112,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:57:56 2015 UTC,He got two outs after the error should of been out of the inning
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,SteroyJenkins,2,Tue Jul 7 02:03:05 2015 UTC,You mean the 2 ground ball hits and the end-of-the-bat single to Abreu? Buehrle did his job. Reyes choked as always.
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,cozeners,3,Tue Jul 7 02:00:24 2015 UTC,All unearned runs man
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,Legit_Fez,0,Tue Jul 7 01:59:58 2015 UTC,is Sale pitching the 9th? If so then it's game over

Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,TLKv3,2,Tue Jul 7 01:57:50 2015 UTC,Yeah lets cough up games in a tight AL east that very well might come down to one game. Whatevs...
Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,Aquahammer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:57:47 2015 UTC,I'm on your side. Reyes is by far from a worthwhile SS in my books. We need these fucking wins right now so much.

Torontobluejays,3ccj2v,peanutbr0,3,Tue Jul 7 01:57:35 2015 UTC,"Except they never win games where they score 2 runs. Their record in games where they've scored two runs or less is 1-18.

Torontobluejays,3cfte7,leeeeeeroy,11,Tue Jul 7 16:06:44 2015 UTC,"1)  Jose Reyes is owed $48 million guaranteed (including his $4 million buyout over the next 2 seasons.  Tulo is owed $98 million guaranteed over the next 5 seasons including his $4 million buyout.  This does not save money, it hurts long term  2) Tulos defense has been declining faster than Reyes' has.  He now grades as a worse defender at short than Reyes.  3) You think Reyes is injury prone?  Tulo has only played more than a 100 games once in the last 4 years (Reyes has twice, and both times it was over 140, versus Tulos 126).  Tulo is only getting worse, and moving him to turf.....would be catastrophic."
Torontobluejays,3cfte7,allirow,7,Tue Jul 7 16:58:37 2015 UTC,And we do what with Reyes exactly?
Torontobluejays,3cfte7,floatate,5,Tue Jul 7 16:12:08 2015 UTC,Maybe he's the answer in LF?
Torontobluejays,3cfte7,TheGursh,4,Tue Jul 7 16:36:03 2015 UTC,The BoSox strategy.
Torontobluejays,3cfte7,floatate,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:12:23 2015 UTC,If our left field was more than 20 feet deep and every ball bounced off the wall towards centre anyways this would be a valid strategy.
Torontobluejays,3cfte7,imtoocoldforthisshit,3,Tue Jul 7 23:00:29 2015 UTC,"Perhaps a straight up trade, or a three team trade with the Mets?  Mets get Reyes, Toronto gets Tulo, and Colorado get a prospect from both the Mets and Toronto?  Tulo is signed longer term but at a lower AAV than Reyes, which could give some financial room to go out and get a pitcher as well."
Torontobluejays,3cfte7,badass_unicorn,2,Tue Jul 7 16:42:24 2015 UTC,"Tulos AAV over the next 5 years is $19.6 million vs Reyes' $24 million over 2 years (both factoring in buyouts of their option years).  I'd rather pay a little more over 2 years to get out of it, rather than save $8 million across 2016-2017 and further commit to a terrible contract."
Torontobluejays,3cfte7,allirow,0,Tue Jul 7 17:05:01 2015 UTC,Tulo is a much better offense upgrade over Reyes as well. Possibly even a defense upgrade as well.
Torontobluejays,3cfte7,Aquahammer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:45:36 2015 UTC,He's for sure a defensive upgrade at this point.  The problem is he's an even bigger injury concern than Reyes is.
Torontobluejays,3cfte7,badass_unicorn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:48:15 2015 UTC,He grades worse at short than Reyes via UZR.
Torontobluejays,3cfte7,allirow,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:01:50 2015 UTC,Over what time frame?
Torontobluejays,3cfte7,ExplainsSocialEnigma,0,Tue Jul 7 22:27:25 2015 UTC,This season
Torontobluejays,3cfte7,allirow,2,Tue Jul 7 22:43:56 2015 UTC,"Uh-huh... so you're taking a 3-month sample (actually in Reyes' case, a 2-month sample) of the stat that takes 3 years to stabilize and saying that Tulo's worse at SS? How about you take the last 3 years or even their entire careers?  Over their careers Tulo is a 4.5 UZR/150 compared to Reyes' -0.1  Over the last 3 years Tulo is 5.5 UZR compared to Reyes' -10.6"
Torontobluejays,3cfte7,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:20:28 2015 UTC,"You have to consider the trends.  We'll use the last 3 years (as you said), while also including this year    Player 2012 2013 2014 2015    Troy Tulowitzki -0.8 +6.6 +3.0 -4.1   Jose Reyes -3.1 -5.3 -6.5 +1.2    And their respect UZR/150 for the last 3 years   Troy Tulowitzki: +4.8 Jose Reyes: -5.8   Jose Reyes has been a consistent -5 UZR.  You know that's what he's going to be at.  Tulowitzki has been trending down each of the last few seasons, only being better than 'average' (+5) 1 year since 2011.  Reyes' defense is below average, and staying there.  Tulo's defense is going consistently.  In 2 years, Reyes will be gone from the Jays, and the Rockies will be cursing the Tulo extension."
Torontobluejays,3cfte7,allirow,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:02:02 2015 UTC,"If you want to do trends with UZR then you need to do a 3-year moving average minimum. That data doesn't show a trend, it shows noise. Doing it right, with a moving average you get: 3.6 6.0, 3.2, 5.3, 4.2, 4.2, 2.9, 1.8 <- there's your decline if you're inclined to look for it though even that's still pretty noisy.  Either way that decline is still better than Reyes' status quo.   In 2 years, Reyes will be gone from the Jays, and the Rockies will be cursing the Tulo extension.   Reyes is owed $59M. The fact that it's over in 2 years rather than 5 doesn't make it less unpleasant. It's much better to spend $110M for 5 years of good shortstop than $59M for 2 years of good shortstop."
Torontobluejays,3cfte7,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:39:11 2015 UTC,Tulo contract is a little cheaper so some salary could be retained in a trade.   Is the plan to keep him at ss for the next 3.5 years anyways?
Torontobluejays,3cfte7,rustyarrowhead,3,Tue Jul 7 16:23:00 2015 UTC,"we do not need an upgrade at SS for the moment. we need a rotation that doesn't have us running uphill in 50-60% of games. this wouldn't even be a Donaldson level upgrade at the position but would require a similar, if not much larger, haul of prospects. if you're going to raid the farm, make it for a SP with control.   edit: comment on upgrade also takes health into consideration."
Torontobluejays,3cfte7,Aquahammer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:26:30 2015 UTC,Moving Reyes and taking in Tulo would free up money and give us a pretty decent upgrade at that position. Though I agree pitching needs to be our focus.
Torontobluejays,3cfte7,allirow,2,Tue Jul 7 16:46:36 2015 UTC,"Even in a straight deal, swapping Tulo and Reyes would save $8 million across 2016-2017 (not per year, total).  It would also add $58 million across 2018-2020."
Torontobluejays,3cfte7,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:06:52 2015 UTC,So... for the cost of $50M we get four years of Tulo instead of two years of Reyes? Sounds pretty good.
Torontobluejays,3cfte7,allirow,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:29:08 2015 UTC,$58 million through his age 35 season (3 years) when he's already declining. That's not good.  At all.
Torontobluejays,3cfte7,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:32:17 2015 UTC,"Reyes' contract is even worse: $70M over his 32-34 seasons (plus an $18M option for 35). More money, fewer years."
Torontobluejays,3cfte7,allirow,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:43:08 2015 UTC,That money has already been expended though.  Reyes is out after 2017 (2 more years).  Supplanting one overpaid injury prone short stop for another that's owed through 2020 is not a better deal.  They're free of every contract but Martin after 2017.  That money needs to be free for youth.
Torontobluejays,3cfte7,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:13:38 2015 UTC,"$59M of it is still owed.   Supplanting one overpaid injury prone short stop for another that's owed through 2020 is not a better deal.   Depends on how much better the other short-stop is and what our other options are at the position.   That money needs to be free for youth.   Youth is cheap. The only place to spend money is on older stars anyway. Either way, the easiest way to free money is to open Rogers' wallet rather than eschewing good expensive players."
Torontobluejays,3cfte7,basas22,2,Tue Jul 7 23:24:25 2015 UTC,"The money isn't worth it IMO. Our lineup is already insane, and I think most people would agree that allocating that money to the rotation would be a better use for it."

Torontobluejays,3cbd7i,allirow,10,Mon Jul 6 16:26:35 2015 UTC,"Rough MLB starts to careers don't often derail prospect rankings that much (if at all).  Pompey was only up for 23 games this season, and has continued raking it in AA.  Norris only made 5 starts before being sent back down."

Torontobluejays,3cbd7i,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:24:38 2015 UTC,That's absolutely not true. He's been one of the worst starters in the Majors this year.
Torontobluejays,3cbd7i,cookiemountain18,6,Tue Jul 7 14:31:23 2015 UTC,"How did you reach that conclusion?  He's been worth 1.2 bWar.

EDIT: I didn't address the 'worst starters in the majors' claim.   He ranks 57th out of 136 in average game score. Basically the same as Michael Pineda and Buehrle.

Torontobluejays,3cb615,allirow,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:35:21 2015 UTC,"It depends on how his season closes out.  If he catches up to his peripherals then certainly not.

Torontobluejays,3cb615,ismizz,6,Mon Jul 6 15:20:40 2015 UTC,"This stopped being true a couple years ago.  Also, the Jays are in on every starting pitcher... AA has essentially said that. This isn't really news or a leak."
Torontobluejays,3cb615,Mapleleaf97,2,Mon Jul 6 15:55:41 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call this a ""leak"".  Doesn't take much of a journalist to connect the dots and connect the Jays to all the most common rental SPs being thrown around.  We've seen the Jays connected to Samardzija, Hamels, Cueto, etc.  Mostly just guys speculating on twitter."

Torontobluejays,3cb615,arterian,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:05:05 2015 UTC,His price should be at an all time low since his performance is down and he's hitting free agency next year anyway
Torontobluejays,3cb615,Qwyjibo_,-1,Mon Jul 6 17:15:37 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking. We should be able to get him for Norris. I'd do that trade.
Torontobluejays,3cb615,juliusseizure,5,Mon Jul 6 16:34:34 2015 UTC,"Norris has 6 years of control and he's a top-10 prospect in baseball. The Athletics got ripped for trading Addison Russell for Samardzia and Hammel last year, and that was when Shark still had 1.5 years of control and was looking like a dominant ace. There's no way the Jays should be expected to give up Norris for Shark now, and I really hope they're smart enough to not make that deal. If you want to deal Norris (you shouldn't, since he's not that far from the majors himself), it should be in a trade for a starter with a lot more control than what you'd get with Shark."
Torontobluejays,3cbyzh,baseballbirds6,2,Mon Jul 6 18:52:52 2015 UTC,"Whoa, Justin Smoak is at 133 wRC+ and is expected to remain at that level for the rest of the season. Is this for real?"
Torontobluejays,3cbyzh,herro_of_canton,3,Mon Jul 6 20:51:32 2015 UTC,"Hi, I wrote the article. The expected value indicates that his season to date has been for real, in that he's legitimately been hitting the ball really hard and displaying good offensive traits.  Fangraphs Depth Charts project Smoak for a 104 wRC+ going forward, which I'd expect him to outperform since Steamer and ZiPS are unaware of his advanced batted ball peripherals."
Torontobluejays,3cbyzh,stman4,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:44:53 2015 UTC,Nice. I am hopeful. Do you take platoon splits or usage against pitching into account?

Torontobluejays,3cf6br,nocturnal_goatsucker,6,Tue Jul 7 13:01:46 2015 UTC,I wish Griffin was one of my teachers back when I went to school. A lot of those grades are way too generous.
Torontobluejays,3cf6br,darth-helmet,8,Tue Jul 7 13:24:07 2015 UTC,"The grading scale was B as anticipated and then relative grading to that. For that reason it makes it pretty hard for the stars to score well and shockingly easy for players such as Ryan Goins to crawl over the bar of expectation that he set.   I just think the grade for Alex was ridiculous. If we let him go we are going to be in big trouble, and he will fill the first vacancy available."

Torontobluejays,3cf6br,rustyarrowhead,2,Tue Jul 7 13:27:48 2015 UTC,Precisely what I was thinking too. The grading should be based on what they've actually contributed.
Torontobluejays,3cf6br,darth-helmet,2,Tue Jul 7 13:30:53 2015 UTC,"right, and yet he couldn't escape giving Donaldson an A+. like what was his expected performance if he's getting an A+? I would give him like and A- if B is expected performance."
Torontobluejays,3cf6br,rustyarrowhead,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:44:38 2015 UTC,Since it's a subjective grading report - as any such report is - this is just eye candy.  Nobody will ever agree with it.

Torontobluejays,3c86vs,teachowski,17,Sun Jul 5 20:32:57 2015 UTC,No player should be off limits.  It depends on the return.
Torontobluejays,3c86vs,allirow,6,Sun Jul 5 20:34:13 2015 UTC,We would absolutely need an MLB caliber outfielder in return if we traded Pillar. We have no one else to put out there.
Torontobluejays,3c86vs,Megakenny,3,Sun Jul 5 20:34:38 2015 UTC,Again it depends on the return. Carrera or Pompey would play and that might be worth the cost if the return is good enough.

What Donaldson brings to the team not only defensively and at the plate but in the clubhouse as well, we're not likely to find an equal. Maybe if we were in a rebuild, but we're not, this is absolutely a team that, with a healthy Stroman, 2 reliable arms in the bullpen and we're at the top of the AL East with a few games in hand.

Torontobluejays,3c7l4o,stman4,2,Mon Jul 6 18:26:59 2015 UTC,"That isn't a special collection of young talent though (most teams have a bulk of similar unestablished pitchers) and the Jays only have two guys already in place for next season, Hutch and Stroman.

Torontobluejays,3c73ai,SteroyJenkins,2,Sun Jul 5 20:24:19 2015 UTC,Yeah Travis' defense is just awful

Torontobluejays,3c73ai,ad19,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:20:37 2015 UTC,I think he would be a nice guy to have in middle relief. Osuna/Cecil/Hendriks/Loup/Delabar/Castro/Schultz seems like a nice bullpen.

Torontobluejays,3c73ai,schlaBAM,2,Sun Jul 5 20:18:09 2015 UTC,Does it still count as a save situation for Osuna since the jays scored another run in the 9th?
Torontobluejays,3c73ai,andycaps,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:17:14 2015 UTC,If it's more than 1 inning it's a save regardless of how big a lead.
Torontobluejays,3c73ai,allirow,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:17:59 2015 UTC,"*More than three innings  It's a save situation if a) you come in with the tying run on deck (or at-bat or on base), b) you come in with a lead of 3 runs-or less and pitch at least 1.0 innings, or c) you come in with any lead and you pitch at least 3.0 innings  So this isn't a save situation for Osuna."
Torontobluejays,3c73ai,ExplainsSocialEnigma,2,Sun Jul 5 20:24:27 2015 UTC,"Fuck, I know Osuna hasn't pitched for a couple of days but does he really need to come in with a 5-run lead? Don't we have a lesser reliever for this?"
Torontobluejays,3c73ai,ExplainsSocialEnigma,4,Sun Jul 5 20:16:52 2015 UTC,"Probably just a good idea to get him some work.  He's used to going back to back days, so may as well bring him in now to lock this shit down 100%."
Torontobluejays,3c73ai,allirow,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:18:44 2015 UTC,"He's been used a lot before these last few days. If anything, he probably needs the rest more than he needs the work.

Torontobluejays,3c73ai,paulcrose,4,Sun Jul 5 20:08:47 2015 UTC,OSUNA OR LATER AMIRITE?

Torontobluejays,3c73ai,allirow,-2,Sun Jul 5 19:59:28 2015 UTC,Clean including not giving up walks or hits is what I meant

Torontobluejays,3c73ai,paulcrose,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:36:11 2015 UTC,Travis hitting 297 any chance for him at all-star?
Torontobluejays,3c73ai,TxksDQZN,6,Sun Jul 5 19:33:25 2015 UTC,That missed month really cost him. I think he would have been an All-Star if he didnt get injured.
Torontobluejays,3c73ai,BettyWhiteOnSteroids,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:35:58 2015 UTC,Would u say pillars an all-star?
Torontobluejays,3c73ai,TxksDQZN,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:40:24 2015 UTC,He's a good OF but I doubt he'd even be selected as a reserve.
Torontobluejays,3c73ai,allirow,2,Sun Jul 5 19:55:07 2015 UTC,That not-missed month really hurt him. He might've been an All-Star if he didn't play so poorly in May.
Torontobluejays,3c73ai,ExplainsSocialEnigma,6,Sun Jul 5 19:53:11 2015 UTC,"Defence doesn't really get recognized in the All-Star game, so I doubt it."

Torontobluejays,3c73ai,ExplainsSocialEnigma,6,Sun Jul 5 19:32:12 2015 UTC,Trade Devon Travis?  No thanks.
Torontobluejays,3c73ai,capbrune,2,Sun Jul 5 19:31:14 2015 UTC,Who is saying that?
Torontobluejays,3c73ai,ExplainsSocialEnigma,2,Sun Jul 5 19:54:24 2015 UTC,A few people around here are posting about being okay with trading Travis and Pillar and other prospects for pitching help.   I don't think any Blue Jays staff have said anything similar.
Torontobluejays,3c73ai,capbrune,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:11:49 2015 UTC,Travis and Pillar are not prospects - they are frontline players. Trading them would be highly unorthodox for a buying team.
Torontobluejays,3c73ai,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:18:57 2015 UTC,I agree with you. They need to remain for as long as they prove that they can start.
Torontobluejays,3c73ai,capbrune,3,Sun Jul 5 20:24:12 2015 UTC,We looked for our every day second baseman for far too long to just trade him away.
Torontobluejays,3c73ai,9001,2,Sun Jul 5 19:45:38 2015 UTC,LOL Alex Wilson and the hickey on his neck. Good for you bawd

Torontobluejays,3c73ai,TLKv3,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:30:28 2015 UTC,He (and/or Rivera) made the same mistake they made in Washington: he was going to 3rd but the runner at 3rd was held up.

Torontobluejays,3c73ai,jBURRd,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:30:14 2015 UTC,I had the chicken tosados which were delicious.  They also had Tri City beer on special.  Had a couple of bottles of their Belgian Pale Ale.  Less than twenty bucks (with tip) for two beers and an app.
Torontobluejays,3c73ai,BasedPython,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:08:16 2015 UTC,Not trying to be butthurt or anything but I don't see anything wrong with the stadium's location. Probably in the safest part of the city.

Torontobluejays,3c73ai,strikeanywhere2,3,Sun Jul 5 18:49:59 2015 UTC,I like his swing and defense but I think he needs more ABs to reach full potential  He's under team control in 2016 so giving him the starting 1B job (with Edwin at DH) is fine with me.

Torontobluejays,3c6hpx,_rand_mcnally_,2,Sun Jul 5 15:33:19 2015 UTC,"Due diligence or not I think the point here is that the Jays may loose a player because corporate is dragging their heels and basing decisions on dollar figures rather than the income wins generate when they should be trusting the person they hired to do a specific job.    Typical corporate shit, AA is middle management."
Torontobluejays,3c6hpx,_rand_mcnally_,3,Sun Jul 5 21:51:44 2015 UTC,"AA prepares his offers to ownership first and then presents them to the player.  In the 2012 winter meetings he got approval for a 5 year/$75 million offer to Anibal Sanchez and presented it to him.  Sanchez declined because he wanted to test the free agency waters.  AA moved on and less than 48 hours struck the Miami trade.  This past off-season, he got approval from ownership for the 5 year/$82 million offer to Russel Martin, which he accepted.  Ownership doesn't drag their heels, AA assembles his offer for a player.  If they won't bite, he'll move on rather than wait and focus on one player and let another opportunity pass him by."

Torontobluejays,3c6hpx,theFlamingRaven,-8,Sun Jul 5 16:50:12 2015 UTC,I'm willing to package Travis up with one of Pillar/Norris if it means getting a solid & consistent starting pitcher or a really good reliever (if AA can somehow work that into being possible to begin with).  Goins has the better defense. Travis has the better bat. But the rest of our line-up is solid with their bats that losing Travis shouldn't be that big of a blow. Especially if it solidifies our other weak areas. Goins sliding in for the defensive boost also helps ease the burden of losing Travis some.  I can stand with being without a great 2B bat/decent 2B defense if it means the pitching gets better by leaps and we still have a poor 2B bat/great 2B defense.

We finally have a bat at second base, and people calling in a cold streak, it's his first year in the show, he's putting together way better AB's than seasoned veterans.  I know this is the year you make the big splash and push for October, but then beyond that, our team is getting old.  I think there needs to be a slight focus on building some pillars (pun intended) for the future.  Travis still has such a high ceiling and can develop  under the Jays to become a solid secind base in the league."

Torontobluejays,3c4pcz,cloud_28,14,Sat Jul 4 21:44:32 2015 UTC,"He also strikeouts 5x more then he walks, has a ridiculously unsustainable BABIP, and gives me a heart attack when a baseball is hit in his direction in the outfield"
Torontobluejays,3c4pcz,moneycitymaniac,4,Sat Jul 4 20:28:37 2015 UTC,For context: Colabello's BABIP is currently .432. League average is generally around .300.    Ty Cobb had a career BABIP of .378. Mike Trout has a career BABIP of .360. Starling Marte lead baseball in BABIP in 2014 with a .373 BABIP.
Torontobluejays,3c4pcz,FR05TB1T3,3,Sat Jul 4 22:12:10 2015 UTC,Honestly we just need it to stay up until Saunders is ready to return.
Torontobluejays,3c4pcz,Bridgemaster11,2,Sat Jul 4 23:16:53 2015 UTC,what does BABIP stand for?
Torontobluejays,3c4pcz,cloud_28,4,Sat Jul 4 20:30:22 2015 UTC,Batting Average on Balls In Play
Torontobluejays,3c4pcz,joeap,4,Sat Jul 4 23:11:29 2015 UTC,"http://www.fangraphs.com/library/pitching/babip/  For simplicity sake, its essentially a luck factor on the balls you hit in play. Hes been very lucky thus far, and I fear hes going to come crashing down hard."
Torontobluejays,3c4pcz,Qwyjibo_,7,Sat Jul 4 20:32:31 2015 UTC,"Baseball is probably more susceptible to luck than just about any sport. Hitters for the most part aren't that good at aiming balls. The players who get the most hits are generally those who put the most balls in play (also the type of balls they hit IE line drives). This increases their chance that a ball will land where a fielder isn't. Right now colabello isn't putting many balls in play. Unless he's better than just about anyone in the majors at aiming hits, he's getting lucky."
Torontobluejays,3c4pcz,yourethegoodthings,-1,Sat Jul 4 20:33:19 2015 UTC,Not in the long run. Definitely in the short run.
Torontobluejays,3c4pcz,gandalfsnutsack,-3,Sat Jul 4 21:10:45 2015 UTC,"I'd call it 'attitude' or 'morale', but I get your point."
Torontobluejays,3c4pcz,el_gumbo,3,Sat Jul 4 20:41:07 2015 UTC,"No, I assure you that BABIP does not take into account the attitude or morale of the team.  Cloud really should have explained to you that when a ball is hit into fair territory, across the league 30% of the time it will drop in for a hit.  When a player has a BABIP of .450 that means that 45% of the time he hits a ball into fair territory, it will fall in.  This is unsustainable.  Over decades upon decades of record keeping, league average BABIP has remained at a relatively stable and constant spot.  It's not luck, or attitude, or morale.  It's just probability."
Torontobluejays,3c4pcz,ExplainsSocialEnigma,0,Sat Jul 4 20:48:56 2015 UTC,"Look at Juan Francisco last year. When his luck ran out, he was useless. It's the same thing with Colabello. He's not on the roster once his BABIP regresses to the mean."
Torontobluejays,3c4pcz,Ferivich,0,Sat Jul 4 21:58:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, time to start playing him much less tbh. Give Smoak more ABs at first."
Torontobluejays,3c4pcz,Qwyjibo_,4,Mon Jul 6 04:04:19 2015 UTC,"I get why people can be skeptical on Colabello, but those people should be equally skeptical on Smoak. Smoak has worse numbers for his career, is projected to have worse numbers, and actually has worse numbers this year compared to Colabello."
Torontobluejays,3c4pcz,el_gumbo,4,Sat Jul 4 21:18:05 2015 UTC,"Smoaks BABIP is 100 points lower, less luck on balls in play, his walk rate is 2x higher than Colabello's and his K% is only 3% higher. His defence is also not game changing horrendous. He's been worth half a win more than Colabello in 70 fewer plate appearances.  When we factor in that for some reason Navarro is playing with EE at first you're losing even more with a well below average against RHP bat (Navaroo) and a poor defensive 1B to go with the below average D at short and terrible D in LF."
Torontobluejays,3c4pcz,gandalfsnutsack,7,Sat Jul 4 21:37:05 2015 UTC,"The more at-bats he gets, the further down he's going to be dropping that list."
Torontobluejays,3c4pcz,gandalfsnutsack,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:07:57 2015 UTC,"He just hit a two-run homer in the 9th inning, I think he'll be okay."
Torontobluejays,3c4pcz,el_gumbo,2,Sat Jul 4 20:16:30 2015 UTC,You would be wrong. His BABIP is amazingly unsustainable.
Torontobluejays,3c4pcz,kapacj,4,Sat Jul 4 20:18:52 2015 UTC,Yeah you're right. He'll be back in the minors imminently. Why do we even bother with these scrubs.
Torontobluejays,3c4pcz,Ferivich,2,Sat Jul 4 21:18:35 2015 UTC,"He actually will be. His D is terrible so without his bat, he adds absolutely no value.   There's a reason why his average is so high yet he's posting a 0.3 WAR."
Torontobluejays,3c4pcz,kapacj,-2,Sat Jul 4 21:30:34 2015 UTC,You don't like people very much do you. Or yourself for that matter.

Torontobluejays,3c4pcz,tmlrule,-1,Mon Jul 6 06:38:29 2015 UTC,I never said that. He should be relegated to the bench though and more ABs should be given to Smoak.
Torontobluejays,3c4pcz,kapacj,5,Mon Jul 6 06:45:13 2015 UTC,"He is definitely getting lucky, but we should be capitalizing on his luck. Send him back to the bench when it runs out."
Torontobluejays,3c4pcz,tmlrule,3,Sat Jul 4 21:33:09 2015 UTC,His defence is so bad that he's barely an above replacement player with the bat where it is now. This is the time to sell to a team that could use a 1B/DH or a 1B/LF bench bat.

But he's very vulnerable to the outside pitch and and pitchers know this. He seems like a good candidate for the Brandon Moss adjustment.   I get close to the plate, because people think I want the ball in, but it’s really so that the pitch away becomes middle, and it’s like a heart of the zone pitch. I hit in way better than I hit away, so I trust myself on the inside pitch and I make the outside pitch middle."

Torontobluejays,3c3rct,ExplainsSocialEnigma,3,Sat Jul 4 20:03:35 2015 UTC,I'm not buying that. Pull any Cy Young winner from the NL and they would do pretty close to the same. I get that the knuckler is fickle but not this fickle.

Can't blame him for cashing in. But it was so obvious it was a fluke when the Mets were only too happy to trade him. They knew, most knew except AA"
Torontobluejays,3c3rct,teachowski,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:36:38 2015 UTC,If by one lucky year you mean three excellent years and 600+ excellent innings then sure.  Everyone knew that his last year was likely an overperformance but that isn't what we paid for. 6-win pitchers get paid $30M/year. Dickey's being paid 12.

Torontobluejays,3c3rct,Simple10Jack,0,Sat Jul 4 19:13:25 2015 UTC,"Jays have never been really able to hit good pitchers. They devour bad pitchers with the very, very random game where they somewhat hit a good pitcher. It makes them look better than they actually are and over-hypes them.  This offense is awesome, but the way everyone hypes them up as the best thing ever always makes me roll my eyes. Especially when they run into actually good Starters. Then the excuses come flying out.  EDIT: Instead of downvoting me why don't you respond to me and actually show me I'm wrong? Aside from pointing at the team's record."
Torontobluejays,3c3rct,TLKv3,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:10:25 2015 UTC,What? The Jays have beaten up on some of the best relievers and around this year.

Torontobluejays,3c3rct,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:49:06 2015 UTC,lol. Best relievers.  We need to hit the best starters to get to said relievers. And we can't do that can we?
Torontobluejays,3c3rct,TLKv3,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:48:26 2015 UTC,"You're just not correct.  Kluber, Scherzer, Keuchel, Martinez.  How many ""best starters"" do you think there are in baseball?"
Torontobluejays,3c3rct,Simple10Jack,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:57:58 2015 UTC,I think there's a lot more than that. And you just refuse to give credit or look at the Jays realistically. Don't you think if the Jays could hit good pitching we would be winning the Division right now? Even with our poor pitching? We should be outright dominating. But we're not. Why? Because we devour bad pitching and stall against good pitching. Its just a fact.
Torontobluejays,3c3rct,TLKv3,0,Sat Jul 4 20:04:55 2015 UTC,"Jesus it's hard to read this and not laugh...First of all, you don't lead the league in runs by the margin the Jays do by just beating up on bad pitching. It just doesn't happen. We're not winning the division right now because our pitching is ass, it has nothing to do with how our offence performs against good pitching.  Seriously, what do you consider good pitching? What games specifically are you talking about. Cite some games."
Torontobluejays,3c3rct,Simple10Jack,2,Sat Jul 4 20:10:10 2015 UTC,"Couple that with the fact that the AL East isn't exactly a shining bastion of pitching, and the Jays' offense looks better than it actually is"
Torontobluejays,3c3rct,DistinguishedPleb,5,Sat Jul 4 19:11:51 2015 UTC,But people don't seem to understand that. They see what I said as being negative when I'm really not trying to be. Its just a fact. This Jays offense is great but they fall apart against good to great pitchers. They hear the hype and immediately believe it because they want it to be true/real.  This offense has the potential to be a playoff offense. But it probably won't get them to the World Series without proper pitching to back it up and every single one of them figuring out how to adjust to good pitchers.
Torontobluejays,3c3rct,TLKv3,2,Sat Jul 4 19:18:36 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the Jays do better than most teams against good pitching; there's a reason why guys like King Felix and Sonny Gray have around a 2.5-3 ERA--because it's simply tough to put up 3 or 4 runs against them. It's just that the extra run or so that our offense scores compared to other teams against good pitching means nothing when our pitchers regularly give up 5+ runs to mediocre offenses. Our offense is good, but we can't be serious contenders with the pitching in its current state."

Torontobluejays,3c3rct,allirow,3,Sat Jul 4 18:49:22 2015 UTC,It's not random happenstance if you control the risk. Travis shouldn't have been far enough off the bag to risk being picked off. It's just bad baserunning and he got burned for it.
Torontobluejays,3c3rct,ExplainsSocialEnigma,3,Sat Jul 4 19:01:23 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with the happenstance, but when you're behind like we are against a pitcher like Price, you don't take shitty leads like that."
Torontobluejays,3c3rct,silentfuryx,2,Sat Jul 4 18:53:51 2015 UTC,I hate to say it but I think you're right. They rushed him back into the primary line-up too quick. Throw him back to AAA for a few more starts and let Goins play second. The defense will go back up. The offense might suffer a bit but it'll be worth not conceding baserunners and possibly runs.

Any way you look at it, it was the wrong call from the beginning.  Valencia should have been called safe to begin with.  Also, the block of the plate scenario never has been addressed.  What happened here was that the umpire made the wrong call and the interpretation of the rules were twisted to make it appear that the ump was right to begin with.  Seriously how can a catcher be a manager?  Here is another video to have a look at.  Similar situation except for the 2nd tag after being called out (which would have been the case if Valencia would have just went back to the dugout).  This player did leave the baseline and never touched home.  BTW the one Miami announcer is quite annoying..."

In this case, the catcher, apparently, can replace the ""defensive Manager,"" as the interpretation of the regulations as applied in this case is that the replay official under the circumstances is to rule the runner out for failing to touch home if he is subsequently tagged upon appeal (or the defence properly appeals the base)."

Torontobluejays,3c2hk2,cbarone1,2,Sat Jul 4 16:03:46 2015 UTC,"It's still incredibly easy to protest a game, you just can't protest a replay."
Torontobluejays,3c2hk2,ExplainsSocialEnigma,2,Sat Jul 4 16:39:11 2015 UTC,"The rules actually haven't changed.  Protesting games are rare, and successful protests are even rarer.   There used to be a website that measured the correctness of umpires, but I can't seem to find it now."
Torontobluejays,3c2hk2,MLBVideoConverterBot,2,Sat Jul 4 17:07:38 2015 UTC,"The first part, what you say was supposed to happen, is only if there was no tag whatsoever. Gibbons' challenge was about whether or not Valencia touched the plate. With no conclusive evidence one way or another, and knowing that Valencia was tagged before he could try and touch the plate, the initial call stands, and he's out. Had he never been tagged after the play at the plate, they would have had to call him safe on the replay. It was a shitty situation for the team, but the umpires got it right."
Torontobluejays,3c2hk2,cbarone1,2,Sat Jul 4 14:59:15 2015 UTC,"You're correct.   The ""if the defensive manager appeals"" clause is just a backup so that the defensive team can appeal in a more formal fashion if they fail to tag.  This (at 3:45) is what a plate appeal normally looks like and that's the right that the rules are intending to preserve. If the tag is never made and the runner misses the plate the defence has the right to make that appeal and if they don't and it goes to review then the runner is safe. If they do make the appeal the runner can be called out on the review of that appeal. (In this video there's lots of confusion at first because Bochy needed clarification on how a review would work post-appeal).  That appeal is unnecessary though if you apply a tag on a tag play. It's weird as hell that they're describing the tag as an appeal instead of just a normal tag. Especially when that tag does not meet the definition of an Appeal Play."
Torontobluejays,3c2hk2,cbarone1,2,Sat Jul 4 15:44:35 2015 UTC,"It's strange to me too, that the only source I could find of the catcher becoming the defensive manager is Sportsnet.  I searched and searched through the rulebook and couldn't find anything on the matter."

I mentioned that we have to assume Hannigan misses and there's no initial tag:   So, if we assume that Valencia fails to touch home and Hanigan misses tag Valencia, then the Replay Official should disregard the failure, declare the runner ""safe"" and score the run.    Unfortunately the Blue Jays didn't have any sort of rule on their side."
Torontobluejays,3c2hk2,Maico80,0,Sat Jul 4 16:40:22 2015 UTC,"Well, there's the problem. We don't need to assume he missed the first tag, because he did. But with no proof that Valencia touched the plate, and a very obvious tag afterwards on the second attempt, he's out, plain and simple. Just because there was a replay review doesn't mean what happened after the replay is nullified. He was tagged out before he touched home. The only thing the review would have changed is if Valencia touched home or not. If he touched home he would have been safe. He appeared not to, so the second tag got him out.  I don't know why they cited that rule during the game because it's not what happened. Had there been no succesful tag attempt after the missed tag, it would have been applicable. But there was one."
Torontobluejays,3c2hk2,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:47:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what the ""problem"" is? I know every rule was followed.  Here's the rule:  Source   A runner attempts to score on a play at the plate. The catcher misses the tag on the runner, and the runner fails to touch home plate, but the umpire calls a tag and the runner ""out."" The offensive manager challenges the call, and the Replay Official determines that the catcher missed the tag. The Replay Official shall disregard the failure of the runner to touch home plate, declare the runner ""safe"" and score the run.   When Hanigan tagged Valencia successfuly after the play, according to Sportsnet's interpretation of the rules, he became the Defensive Manager and appealed it:   Under V.F.3 of the Major League Baseball Replay Review Regulations, ""when reviewing a play at home plate, if the Replay Official determines both that the runner did not touch home plate and that the fielder did not tag the runner (or, in the case of a force play, did not touch home plate), the Replay Official shall rule the runner ‘safe’ at home plate unless the defensive Manager appeals the failure of the runner to touch home plate prior to the Crew Chief making contact with the Replay Official."""

Torontobluejays,3c11br,allirow,8,Fri Jul 3 20:01:14 2015 UTC,Does this guys dad work for us or something? we are constantly linked to him it seems
Torontobluejays,3c11br,But-Seriously-Though,5,Fri Jul 3 20:12:44 2015 UTC,Probably because we've had bad rotations and he's a good SP that's on the block.
Torontobluejays,3c11br,gandalfsnutsack,3,Fri Jul 3 23:45:55 2015 UTC,"I'd be happy to take him but would not want to give up much. As a rental on a down year, he could easily end up providing very little value for us."
Torontobluejays,3c11br,Born_Ruff,9,Fri Jul 3 22:22:10 2015 UTC,"I think that if we bring in a coveted starter it will have an all around wicked affect on the whole team.  Sanchez goes to the pen and can eat a lot of innings, allows guys like Loup who pitch well on a lot of rest get better, and can get more meaningful innings.  Bring in two starters you also put Estrada in the pen.  Then you get a little crazy and bring Stro back in September and you all the sudden have a respectable staff!  I'm excited for moves this year.  Been a while since Jays fans could say that!"
Torontobluejays,3c11br,theFlamingRaven,7,Fri Jul 3 20:17:23 2015 UTC,Do you think the Jays would actually move Sanchez to the bullpen? He's has been progressing as a starter pretty nicely.
Torontobluejays,3c11br,Born_Ruff,6,Fri Jul 3 22:20:26 2015 UTC,"If they get a starter I think they will for sure.  Much needed relief for the pen and he can just let loose again.  Agree with you that he has progressed for sure and in the recent seasons where they weren't necessarily pushing for playoffs I would say let him have at it!  Bring in a solid starter and I bet they protect Sanchez.   I don't love it, just how I see it though!"
Torontobluejays,3c11br,theFlamingRaven,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:32:09 2015 UTC,Are we better off with Estrada in the rotation or Sanchez?
Torontobluejays,3c11br,Born_Ruff,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:33:26 2015 UTC,Estrada doesn't replace Sanchez and hasn't. Boyd replaced Sanchez.
Torontobluejays,3c11br,Garrison_Creeker,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:50:57 2015 UTC,Yeah. I am asking who a new pitcher should replace.
Torontobluejays,3c11br,Born_Ruff,0,Sat Jul 4 04:15:03 2015 UTC,Sanchez's slot in the rotation. He's been one of the worst starters on our team (with Dickey) by almost all advanced metrics.
Torontobluejays,3c11br,Ferivich,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:42:21 2015 UTC,"A month ago I would have hands down said Sanchez.  With his DL stint, especially with it being a strain injury, I don't mind the idea of sheltering him a little bit.  Not to mention, Estrada has pitched his way into the rotation as a five guy, can't forget he is still just Marco Estrada though."
Torontobluejays,3c11br,theFlamingRaven,2,Fri Jul 3 22:40:42 2015 UTC,He helped remind us who he is on Tuesday.

Torontobluejays,3c11br,theFlamingRaven,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:01:55 2015 UTC,"Wilner mentioned last night that if they put Sanchez in the pen he could come back as much as a month earlier, so if that's true I am all for it."
Torontobluejays,3c11br,Brizzyce,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:27:11 2015 UTC,His walk rate is still too high. He'd be well served to be a reliever this season just based on his body recovery alone. Throwing 100 pitches every five days is different than 20-25 every other day.
Torontobluejays,3c11br,gandalfsnutsack,2,Fri Jul 3 23:47:25 2015 UTC,"I've heard people argue that throwing out of the bullpen can be harder on your body, since you don't get as much time to warm up and prepare your body for each outing.   I know he can be very useful out of the pen, but that is when he is brutalizing opponents with his fastball 90% of the time. Going back to that could be a step back in his development."
Torontobluejays,3c11br,Born_Ruff,0,Fri Jul 3 23:56:32 2015 UTC,Developing as a starter in the majors isn't good either. Especially since Sanchez still needs to work on control. Ideally you'd have him in the pen this year as we try to contend and start the year in Buffalo as a SP next season until he figures it out. He may be a career reliever/closer.
Torontobluejays,3c11br,gandalfsnutsack,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:12:32 2015 UTC,Well apparently 2 years ago we had the best team in baseball.
Torontobluejays,3c11br,corybbank,5,Fri Jul 3 21:55:29 2015 UTC,"I'm going to sound like a typical impatient fan here, but I really wish AA would put his ass in second gear and get something done SOON.  Like today if possible.  The Blue Jays need for both starting and relief pitching is so blatantly obvious and the division is so tight.  One more start by some AAA scrub could cost this team their first playoff appearance in over two decades.    The offense can only bludgeon teams to death so often, and even with the awesome bats we have at some point they are going to go on a cold streak and then may God have mercy on our souls.    Get some pitchers.  Not on July 31, not during the All Star break.  NOW."
Torontobluejays,3c11br,dcmcderm,3,Fri Jul 3 23:32:56 2015 UTC,I agree they need to move fast - sitting and hoping that the 3 teams ahead/around us keep losing at the same time we do is not exactly a recipe for a positive outcome.
Torontobluejays,3c11br,FuckTheFuckingShit,4,Sat Jul 4 13:17:19 2015 UTC,JFC. At this point is there any starter in the league that we HAVEN'T been reported as being interested in?!
Torontobluejays,3c11br,fivetailfox,6,Fri Jul 3 21:46:36 2015 UTC,The Blue Jays are interested in Marcus Stroman
Torontobluejays,3c11br,Mapleleaf97,3,Fri Jul 3 23:27:32 2015 UTC,"Ricky Romero, Roy Halladay, Tomo Ohka, and Gustavo Chacin are all waiting by the phone."
Torontobluejays,3c11br,mmss,2,Fri Jul 3 23:30:42 2015 UTC,"If it doesn't cost a lot, sure why not. He's had a down year so far, but I'm not sure if it's him or the team."
Torontobluejays,3c11br,UsersManual,5,Fri Jul 3 20:26:14 2015 UTC,"His FIP is inline with career norms, his ERA is probably because the White Sox are doing pretty poor defensively"
Torontobluejays,3c11br,69putout,2,Fri Jul 3 20:57:50 2015 UTC,"It doesn't help that he has a 39.6 GB% this year, when it's climbed year over year since 2011 (peaking last year at 50.2%)."
Torontobluejays,3c11br,allirow,2,Fri Jul 3 21:26:08 2015 UTC,I'd rather go after Mat Latos. He has way more experience pitching in hitters' parks than Shark and his fastball velocity is back.
Torontobluejays,3c11br,deadskin,2,Fri Jul 3 22:17:08 2015 UTC,"Is it 2014?  Alex, don't trade Happ!"

Torontobluejays,3c11br,Royal_Flush13,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:54:47 2015 UTC,"He's been good as a starter in his career, but never great. This is his 4th season as a starting pitcher in the majors. In 2012 his era was 3.81, 2013 it was 4.34, and last year it was 2.99. I wouldn't want the team to give up too much for him unless they figure that they can do something for him so he can pitch like he did last year."
Torontobluejays,3c11br,tvismyfriend,8,Fri Jul 3 20:48:49 2015 UTC,He's a middle of the pack starter.  I'd be down for that in the rotation along with an upper rotation arm as well.
Torontobluejays,3c11br,allirow,2,Fri Jul 3 21:26:55 2015 UTC,His fWAR numbers are basically the same as RA Dickey was prior to us acquiring him
Torontobluejays,3c11br,69putout,5,Fri Jul 3 21:00:19 2015 UTC,"He's a 3 win pitcher who gives you 200 innings of 3.55 FIP ball, that's useful on any team."
Torontobluejays,3c13ba,brownmagician,14,Fri Jul 3 20:12:41 2015 UTC,"I feel like AA gets a lot of criticism sometimes (not so much in this community), but whenever I read articles like this, I'm like, wow, what he's doing totally make sense"
Torontobluejays,3c13ba,yellowcanadian,8,Fri Jul 3 21:17:19 2015 UTC,"not so much in this community   Facebook and sportsnet.ca comments are almost as bad as youtube. Stay away.  But in reference to your point about AA - he definitely knows the rules and loopholes of the major, minor, and international systems intimately. He spent a lot of time at every level of the front office and doesn't have the advantage of being a former player or ivy-league hotshot. The dude has to know his shit to have gotten as far as he has at his age. Kudos."
Torontobluejays,3c13ba,Royal_Flush13,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:26:35 2015 UTC,I just don't get the purpose of trading Dejong to save  money? He seemed like a decent prospect.
Torontobluejays,3c13ba,Monofu,3,Sat Jul 4 04:45:20 2015 UTC,It's a fairly significant amount of money saved apparently. The club is apparently strapped for cash despite their wealthy owner so hopefully it gets used on a FA acquisition.   And I've never even heard of Dejong. He's pretty far off the radar.
Torontobluejays,3c13ba,Royal_Flush13,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:10:35 2015 UTC,"The club is given an annual budget and that's that from what I understand. Rogers has so many divisions that make real money for them and the Jays payroll is a percentage of a percentage of all of that. Now, that sounds like 'why not give us a few million more here or there to make us more competitive?' but ultimately the reality is that a corporation like Rogers has given the Jays what they feel is a healthy payroll and they're not going to waste time micro managing it."
Torontobluejays,3c13ba,el_gumbo,2,Sat Jul 4 15:41:44 2015 UTC,Oh I know. Hence why AA needs the extra cash
Torontobluejays,3c13ba,Royal_Flush13,2,Sat Jul 4 15:53:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I can live with the trade too. At least he's making things work to get talent in here at all levels."
Torontobluejays,3c13ba,el_gumbo,11,Sat Jul 4 16:44:28 2015 UTC,I feel like this is more or less the Blue Jays' strategy

A lot of scouts have him pegged as a first baseman due to his size and lack of arm strength but he's probably got three or four years to grow and get stronger before we see him in AA/AAA or the majors

Torontobluejays,3c13ba,thursday51,3,Sat Jul 4 15:24:11 2015 UTC,How exactly are the Dodgers able to trade bonus slots? They already spent like 10 times their 2 million dollar limit.
Torontobluejays,3c13ba,Born_Ruff,4,Fri Jul 3 22:45:55 2015 UTC,"Basically, the Dodgers already knew they were going to go far over their limit by signing one of the top prospects, so they figured they may as well go way over, sign several prospects and accept the same punishment (no other international FAs for the next 2 years).  There's also the calculated risk that there is a decent chance the entire IFA system gets re-done in the next year or two in which case even that punishment might be gone."
Torontobluejays,3c13ba,tmlrule,2,Sat Jul 4 00:44:51 2015 UTC,I get that part. I just don't understand how they are somehow still able to trade away the rights to spend more. Shouldn't their spending spree have used up all of their spending rights and then some?
Torontobluejays,3c13ba,Born_Ruff,2,Sat Jul 4 01:01:26 2015 UTC,"Trading away some of their spending rights just means they are going to go 'more' over. In addition to the ban on signing more IFAs the next few summers (which would have happened anyways), they also have to pay an additional tax on the amount they go over by. So in essence, the Dodgers were willing to pay a higher tax to acquire two Jays prospects."
Torontobluejays,3c13ba,tmlrule,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:08:52 2015 UTC,It means they'll exceed a smaller limit than they would have. They'll pay more tax.

Even his last month was essentially league average hitting, especially when you factor in the fact that pitchers hitting is included in the OPS+ stats.  Colabello's May was pretty god like. Meanwhile Smoak has a pretty similar OPS+ and appears to be heating up. If we are playing Chris at first we might want to throw Smoak in there and get the solid defense and negligible difference in offensive production, and hope Smoak can keep rolling off his recent success."

Torontobluejays,3c28fq,twistedlogicx,11,Sat Jul 4 02:13:37 2015 UTC,"I hate Wilner but he's been saying all season that our rotation just has to be ""ok, not even good"" and they haven't even been able to manage that besides Buerhle and Estrada."
Torontobluejays,3c28fq,arterian,6,Sat Jul 4 02:15:13 2015 UTC,"He's also gone on record several times saying that we are also good enough right now to win the division -- probably as a remark to describe how equal the division is.  Personally, I don't think we are.  Around this time last year the Orioles pulled away.  All it would take is one team to start compiling a few winning streaks.  Is it gonna be the Jays? Sorry, not with this pitching, Mike."
Torontobluejays,3c28fq,nanobot001,6,Sat Jul 4 02:23:28 2015 UTC,"We're halfway through the season and for 2 of the three months, the Jays were sub-.500.  If it weren't for the 11-gamer in June, they would be last.  They can't afford to think they will continue to out-slug teams every night."
Torontobluejays,3c28fq,turbografx-16,5,Sat Jul 4 02:27:07 2015 UTC,Right. If you completely ignore 11 wins they're in last place.

Torontobluejays,3c28fq,ajn19,3,Sun Jul 5 05:41:01 2015 UTC,"The only way we were able to carry those 11 games was to have ""ok, not great"" pitching while slugging it out otherwise on the other half of the inning.  Totally agree.    What made ""ok, not great""?  Estrada pitching like he has never pitched before, Buerhle being Buerle, Dickie being Dickie, and Hutchison being able to cobble some wins, and Sanchez being healthy.  With Sanchez being replaced by question marks every fifth day and Estrada (maybe) falling back to earth, it means we have to rely on 3/5 of a rotation, of which 2/5 (Dickie and Hutchison) are as reliable as a coin toss.  Front of the line pitching is a mess, and it doesn't look like one pitcher (whether acquired by trade or brought up) will make up for that."
Torontobluejays,3c28fq,nanobot001,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:36:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to defend the pitching staff but my god this loss has as much, if not more, to do with our defense throwing the ball around, giving away base after base to Detroit runners. Again, we need some pitching but last night had a lot to do with poor defense."
Torontobluejays,3c28fq,boooourns,9,Sat Jul 4 15:03:11 2015 UTC,"Ahh yes. Yet another game to remind us that having the best offense in the league doesn't mean shit when your pitchers are inept.   If AA doesn't get pitching ASAP, this team has little to no chance, and that is very upsetting considering the team's offensive talent."

Torontobluejays,3c28fq,BettyWhiteOnSteroids,2,Sat Jul 4 02:21:16 2015 UTC,"I know my point is the attitude of we still have X games left is a terrible idea, 2 months ago it was ""relax we have over 100 games left"" and look where we are now."
Torontobluejays,3c28fq,PandaWrestler,2,Sat Jul 4 02:28:55 2015 UTC,"Well after that we had a great month and now we are 1 game away from 1st place. So yeah, look where we are now."

Torontobluejays,3c28fq,PandaWrestler,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:49:00 2015 UTC,"It is not a terrible idea. The number of games left is a very important when considering your chances to make the playoffs. It gives you time to fix your problems. The Jays have lost their fair share of games that could go either way, with more games left to play, it gives them the chance win their share of close games.   And as for 2 months ago, where we are now is 1.5 games back from first place. I would say that is pretty darn good and gives us a great chance to win the division."

If he knew he didn't touch the plate, he should have gone back and touched it, then worried about getting a replay in.  Edit: finally saw the play.

Torontobluejays,3bxtqj,cbarone1,4,Fri Jul 3 15:46:55 2015 UTC,"So that's the third way in which he should be safe by my count.

Torontobluejays,3c04ph,BettyWhiteOnSteroids,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:45:59 2015 UTC,"I'm skeptical of any compiling statistic that includes defensive metrics. At least as of right now. Especially for guys like Bautista in RF. If you have a great defender, that's a bonus, but as long as you aren't Colabello'ing around out there, it's not a huge deal.  Once the stat-cast data is open for everyone to see, I think we're going to be surprised by what we find out. Who are the best defenders, and maybe more importantly, who are the best managers/defensive coaches that best use the batted ball info."
Torontobluejays,3c04ph,Simple10Jack,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:17:52 2015 UTC,"Defensive data takes a long time to stabilize, we know that, but its not like its totally unreliable. We can tell that a ~12 UZR/150 (what fWAR uses) for Pillar isn't unreasonable given his skill. I think DRS expecting a 21 DRS/150 though is a bit unreasonable, and thats the difference with rWAR."
Torontobluejays,3c04ph,BettyWhiteOnSteroids,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:24:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think they're wholly unreliable. I just think they're not great, and might even get fooled. Once we have huge samples of every single batted ball over 5 years, then I think defensive metrics will be really useful in a compiling stat. UZR currently allocates batted balls as ground balls, bunt ground balls, outfield line drives, and outfield fly balls (including so-called pop flies). Then they are classified as soft, medium, or hard. It paints a picture, it's just really far from perfect. When we have large enough batted ball and fielding samples we'll have things like reaction time, distance travelled, route efficiency, ball speed/trajectory. I'm far from a statistician but I imagine that they could eventually have a batted ball down to a percentile, like 95% of the time any given ball in play falls for a hit. Then we can get a true visual on whether someone makes a ton of incredible plays, but isn't that spectacular, or someone who isn't flashy but is so smart that they don't have to be.   Sorry, I didn't mean to go on a tangent. I'm really fascinated by this topic in every sport. Defence seems so impossible to quantify, and I like the idea that we're just beginning to understand it."
Torontobluejays,3c04ph,Simple10Jack,2,Fri Jul 3 23:10:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's bWAR. I think bWAR just really loves Pillar's defence (don't we all?)   Pillar has 3.1 bWAR (1.4 oWAR, 1.8 dWAR) Bautista has 2.9  bWAR (2.5 oWAR, 0 dWAR)"
Torontobluejays,3c04ph,papercrane,3,Fri Jul 3 18:29:39 2015 UTC,"Kevin Pillar has a 3.1 WAR? Jesus, praise be Pillar!"
Torontobluejays,3c04ph,basas22,5,Fri Jul 3 15:59:33 2015 UTC,Not according to fWAR. Bautista has a 2.8 and Pillar has a 2.1. Bautista has also played fewer games.
Torontobluejays,3c04ph,dgapa,6,Fri Jul 3 16:00:20 2015 UTC,"Eh a little misleading. Bautista has a higher fWAR, and Bautista's WAR value was hurt by him DHing quite a bit earlier in the year."
Torontobluejays,3c04ph,kapacj,2,Fri Jul 3 16:06:18 2015 UTC,"One needs to keep in the mind of the context of his WAR earnings.  Has he really been solid all year?   April: 0.5 fWAR May: -0.2 fWAR June: 1.3 fWAR July: 0.4 fWAR   He had an averagish April, a negative fWAR value in May, and incredible hot streak in June that is carrying over into July.  His WAR total for 2 games in July is almost equal to his total for the entire month of April.  He also leads all CF in the last 30 days with a .425 BABIP (.718 in his 2 July games)."
Torontobluejays,3c04ph,allirow,2,Fri Jul 3 17:01:30 2015 UTC,"Don't ever use BABIP for 2 games, it's so silly. Anytime a player gets 3 hits in a game they are going to have a crazy BABIP for that game, it's totally useless in small samples.   Also a 0.5 WAR in April is better than average, it's on pace for 3 WAR for the season. That's good."
Torontobluejays,3c04ph,angrystoic,0,Fri Jul 3 20:49:59 2015 UTC,"Also a 0.5 WAR in April is better than average   Amongst the 28 qualified CFs in April, his 0.5 fWAR placed him 14th.  Exactly average."

Torontobluejays,3c04ph,SteveDougson,2,Fri Jul 3 17:22:39 2015 UTC,"Not a book, but Fangraphs has quite a bit of information up on fancystats. It's worth reading if you haven't browsed through it before."
Torontobluejays,3c04ph,Canadave,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:29:21 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, fWAR tells a different story. I'm also leery of any players whose WAR is heavily based on defense, especially in a small sample."

And look, we're deeply concerned how Bautista is playing. He's had a very poor first half, granted, by his standards.  Good for Pillar though! Just seems like one of those guys you root for."
Torontobluejays,3c04ph,jediofpool,3,Fri Jul 3 16:00:31 2015 UTC,Bautista has been fine. Don't be fooled by the batting average - he's taking his walks. His slash rates are roughly in line with his 2010-2011 last 5 seasons.

Torontobluejays,3byl5n,thedudeyousee,0,Fri Jul 3 11:00:46 2015 UTC,Of course our guys will have lots of RBI's we have lots of great hitters. I still get made when people bring up Miguel's triple crown like it was a big deal. #Trout4MVP
Torontobluejays,3byl5n,thedudeyousee,2,Fri Jul 3 14:07:51 2015 UTC,"It was a big deal... He accomplished something that had not been done since 1967, 11 of the 13 eligible batting triple crowns have been inducted into Cooperstown.   Miggy's bat WAS more valuable than Trout's that year and in fact was the most valuable in baseball, while Trout was more valuable on the base paths and on the field. I think when a rare feat gets accomplished you might overlook WAR a little, especially when you are splitting hairs over the top of the league."
Torontobluejays,3by4qf,twistedlogicx,9,Fri Jul 3 03:02:09 2015 UTC,"It sucks for Redmond. He's done alright but given how much he has pitched, he's the odd man out.   Boyd shouldn't have been here in the first place. I still don't get why he was called up instead of Doubront. Adding Doubront to the 40-man shouldn't be a big deal because you can then just carry him as a long reliever when others get healthy.  I still think Boyd is nothing but trade bait to the Jays but holy hell did that value probably take a bit of a hit today."
Torontobluejays,3by4qf,Qwyjibo_,4,Fri Jul 3 03:10:51 2015 UTC,Reminds me of Nolins first start with the Jays.  He went on to be one of the pieces of the Donaldson deal. I doubt his value took much of a hit.
Torontobluejays,3by4qf,allirow,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:20:07 2015 UTC,That was another mind-boggling choice since I think they had to add Nolin to the 40-man at the time.  I definitely don't think Boyd was going to be the centrepiece to any deal but I imagine NL teams and teams in big parks who may have had some interest will sour a bit on him.
Torontobluejays,3by4qf,Qwyjibo_,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:24:31 2015 UTC,Nolin wouldn't have been rule 5 eligible till this upcoming off-season. It was a strange move.
Torontobluejays,3by4qf,allirow,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:32:33 2015 UTC,"If they had the roster space, the 40-man move isn't such a big deal for someone so early in their career because it allows them a fourth-option which is kind of use-it-or-lose-it."

Torontobluejays,3bvjla,thatlegisatrainwreck,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:25:40 2015 UTC,"Sounds like they traded for more pool money so they'll be over by less than 15%, which means they'll only be restricted for one year.  http://www.baseballamerica.com/international/blue-jays-agree-sign-1-international-prospect-vladimir-guerrero-jr/"
Torontobluejays,3bvjla,twistedlogicx,3,Thu Jul 2 21:31:13 2015 UTC,"While I was one of the most excited people about Vladdy Little ever since I first heard of the rumors back in November, if it's true that the bonus was 4.1M, then this could be a pretty poor move by the Jays. The original thought was that they were going to obliterate their spending limit and sign a bunch of high-end guys, and if that was the case, it was fine if the Jays paid Vlad whatever he wanted. But with the Dodgers themselves going nuts on all the big guys, and the rest of the top talent committed to other teams, I don't know if it was smart to bust your spending cap for a single prospect, just 500K over your max spending limit.   The 2016 class is expected to be very strong, and it might have been smarter to wait to break the cap in that season, when they wouldn't be competing against the Dodgers and most of the other big spenders. As it stands, the Jays have handicapped themselves in the next two signing periods for a single guy."

Torontobluejays,3bvjla,allirow,2,Thu Jul 2 15:20:32 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I've ever been this excited about a prospect signing.
Torontobluejays,3bvjla,twistedlogicx,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:05:50 2015 UTC,I don't think there's been a recent amateur prospect the Jays have signed worth getting excited over (at the time of signing).
Torontobluejays,3bvjla,Sharpeye468,2,Thu Jul 2 17:12:20 2015 UTC,"Roberto Osuna was a very exciting signing at the time. He was a kid who was throwing 95 and pitching in the Mexican league at 15 years old. There were many New York fans that thought the Yankees were going to get him, and it felt great when the Jays outbid them."
Torontobluejays,3bvjla,CornOnTheHob,2,Thu Jul 2 17:46:41 2015 UTC,"there was a decent amount of ink dedicated to Hechavarria when we signed him, iirc"

Torontobluejays,3c2fzh,allirow,3,Sat Jul 4 03:43:10 2015 UTC,Your username is so ironic right now in regards to the lack of effort you put into this post
Torontobluejays,3c2fzh,matthewhandy,2,Sat Jul 4 03:41:36 2015 UTC,"Hutchison appears to have the young player problem of control and not command. By watching him + looking at some of the data, he is hanging his off-speed pitches, and his changeup is very hittable in the zone.  He also has problems with pitching with runners on base, and his slider doesn't look as sharp out of the stretch. I wonder if there is a site that lets you look at movement and splits (i.e. movement w and w/o runners on).  Then again, he only has ~250 ML innings under him and it could be randomness.   It is undeniable that he has issues with men-on-base however, and that partly contributes to the ERA/FIP disparity.  (MOB = Men on Base); (BE = Bases Empty)    Year K% BE K% MOB BB% BE BB% MOB GB% MOB GB% BE    2014 25.4% 20.4% 7.8% 7.3% 36.1% 36.1%   2015 24.7% 13.9% 3.5% 9.7% 43.1% 40.1%"

Torontobluejays,3bwse5,--ChaseTheAce--,2,Fri Jul 3 02:10:49 2015 UTC,So I have like 3 big issues with that Valencia call at home.  1) He looked like he hit the plate and Hanigan missed the tag 2) Hanigan looked like he blocked the plate before he got the ball 3)  The rules specifically define this situation and say that the runner is safe

Torontobluejays,3bwse5,cozeners,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:07:31 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of that. This call could be protested because as stated below in this thread,    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section F or elsewhere in these Regulations, in accordance with Official Baseball Rule 8.02(c) (formerly Rule 9.02(c)), when reviewing a play at home plate, if the Replay Official determines both that the runner did not touch home plate and that the fielder did not tag the runner (or, in the case of a force play, did not touch home plate), the Replay Official shall rule the runner ""safe"" at home plate unless the defensive Manager appeals the failure of the runner to touch home plate prior to the Crew Chief making contact with the Replay Official. Example. A runner attempts to score on a play at the plate. The catcher misses the tag on the runner, and the runner fails to touch home plate, but the umpire calls a tag and the runner ""out."" The offensive manager challenges the call, and the Replay Official determines that the catcher missed the tag. The Replay Official shall disregard the failure of the runner to touch home plate, declare the runner ""safe"" and score the run.   Thus, this was a violation of the rules and is not considered a judgement call, unless I'm mistaken in what rules are."
Torontobluejays,3bwse5,GreenLeaf98,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:19:20 2015 UTC,"Well, I was referring to the call at the plate (a judgement call) and the replay call being inconclusive (another judgement call, which was the right call, as much as I hate to say it.)  As for the rules, you're right about the above, but you'll have to read this SN article for the full scoop. Apparently there is a rule that allows the catcher or manager to appeal a ""no tag/no plate"" instance, and that's what the Red Sox did. The catcher tagged Valencia after the play, therefore he's out. That is allowed to negate the fact that both the tag and the plate were missed on the initial play."

Torontobluejays,3bxz9n,Beatle_Matt,3,Fri Jul 3 12:15:07 2015 UTC,"Did Gibbons try to protest the game but was refused because it could be considered ""protesting safe/out calls""? If so, since this is an official rule, they might be onto something. Only thing is that usually a protest has to be made known to the officials right after the call is made.  Nevertheless, it's clear this play had a huge role in momentum swing, etc, and cost us a good chance at a comeback."

Torontobluejays,3bvf3u,allirow,16,Thu Jul 2 13:51:04 2015 UTC,Just wanted to say these are amazing. Thanks for putting the time in.
Torontobluejays,3bvf3u,remorsecodex,4,Thu Jul 2 16:05:40 2015 UTC,"From what I've been reading with the drama over in LA, between Moreno/Scisocia vs DiPoto, part of the reason the Wells trade was made was because Scioscia and Napoli were butting heads, and Scioscia wanted him gone, so DiPoto was told to move him. Not to say that AA didn't pull some magic out of his ass to be the trade partner and get Napoli in return with minimal commitment to Wells' salary, just saying this isn't the fleecing it once looked like.   DiPoto had his hands tied, and we might have been the only team to come knocking, or he knew we wanted to move Wells and came a-callin'. Either way, still an A+ trade, it's just interesting to learn some of the backstory about it 4+ years later."
Torontobluejays,3bvf3u,cbarone1,2,Thu Jul 2 14:27:27 2015 UTC,That whole Angels front office just seems like a mess.
Torontobluejays,3bvf3u,twistedlogicx,2,Thu Jul 2 16:14:48 2015 UTC,"Inaccurate. Jerry Dipoto was hired as the General Manager of the Angels in October of 2011, nearly a year after the Wells trade. The GM that made the Wells trade was Tony Reagins, who was probably one of the worst executives in the game at the time. If I remember correctly, it was written that Arte Moreno had a hand in the Wells deal, and that wouldn't be very hard to believe, considering trades that have payroll implications of that magnitude always have to run through ownership anyway."
Torontobluejays,3bvf3u,cbarone1,0,Thu Jul 2 21:22:10 2015 UTC,"I stand corrected. The whole point still stands, though, it just changes who was forced to deal him. The only reason I mentioned the feuding between Scoscia and DiPoto was because that's how I read about Scoscia and Napoli butting heads."
Torontobluejays,3bvf3u,_zerokarma_,3,Thu Jul 2 22:09:27 2015 UTC,Flipping Napoli for Francisco is still and F for me. I never liked that trade right from the beginning. There is no way to tell how long we would have ended up keeping Napoli if we held on to him but I am pretty sure he would have been more useful to us than Francisco was.
Torontobluejays,3bvf3u,tion24,3,Thu Jul 2 18:01:18 2015 UTC,"True, but I don't think anyone foresaw how bad Francisco would be"

Torontobluejays,3bvf3u,Quikheat,2,Thu Jul 2 19:21:32 2015 UTC,"There was no room for Napoli though.  His AVN forced him to split time between 1B/C/DH, and between Edwin and Lind occupying 1st and DH, they wouldn't have had a spot for him.  There's also no telling how bad his knees would've reacted to playing on turf for nearly 100 games during those seasons when he was still catching."

Torontobluejays,3bvf3u,remorsecodex,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:31:43 2015 UTC,AA has been pretty solid this whole time. I dont think there are many candidates better for our team. His best skill is drafting and signing prospects and developing prospects. We have one of the best systems in the league and that helps us even AA makes some so so trades because we have the depth to replace our pieces.
Torontobluejays,3bvf3u,remorsecodex,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:01:47 2015 UTC,"In next week's post, I know that no matter what you do, somebody is going to vehemently disagree with the Dickey/Marlins grades, because everyone feels differently about those deals.   Personally, I don't think the Marlins trade was a bad one at any point, but it's worse now than it was at the time. Alvarez was shit and became very good, Johnson was great and became very shit, Escobar did exactly what Escobar does and had a 3-win season followed by a poor season, and DeSclafani emerged as a solid piece. Bonifacio was an utter disappointment. Still, Reyes and Buehrle did exactly what you would have wanted them to do, and have given the Jays 15.3 fWAR (RA9 for Buehrle) since the deal.   Conversely, while I always believed that the Dickey trade was hot garbage, I think it's been slightly better in retrospect than it was at the time. The Jays have gotten 5.8 RA9-WAR from Dickey since the trade, and while that's not good for what they gave up, it could have easily been much worse."

He would be a huge asset to have developing in our farm leagues. Which Jays farm team do you guys think he would play for? I live in Vancouver and I am hoping he might play for the Vancouver Canadians. Kind of choked that I never saw Kevin Pillar play in Van.
Torontobluejays,3btoid,jediofpool,2,Thu Jul 2 06:46:25 2015 UTC,"I would bet on him starting in Bluefield. He's only 16, so he'll be moved conservatively. But what the hell do I know? Haha.

League average GB% this year is 45.4, so while he would not be called a flyball pitcher, he can't be called an extreme groundball pitcher either.  His above average line drive percentage (24/110), inability to induce soft contact (tie for 105/110), and above average hard contact (tie 34/110) don't suggest a pitcher who ought to be a high strand rate, FIP beater."

Torontobluejays,3btimc,BooksAreForJerks,4,Thu Jul 2 03:40:57 2015 UTC,"While the Cueto/ chapman combo is the best talent wise, I would go with the Kazmir/Clippard combo. Both would get the job done but that A's combo would be more affordable salary wise and they would not need to give nearly as much prospects. Boyd would be a nice piece to throw on that trade along with 2-3 other pieces."
Torontobluejays,3btimc,gregthehobbit,3,Thu Jul 2 02:32:30 2015 UTC,"I want Cueto the most, but I think Chapman would be too expensive. I'd love to get Cueto then get K-Rod."
Torontobluejays,3btimc,BettyWhiteOnSteroids,3,Thu Jul 2 01:01:29 2015 UTC,"I'm going out on a limb and saying, if we are able to deal before the deadline, none of these players will be involved. The reasoning as follows.   Cueto/Chapman - Certainly looks like the highest impact duo on paper. BUT, we are hearing rumblings and grumblings about Cueto not being at 100%. In addition, this would take a MONUMENTAL haul and Anthopolous has said that he it not willing to part with his biggest young pieces for rentals. I'm sure there is a bit of leniency with that but the pervailing thought is, this one would just take too much.  Hamels/Papelbon - there are issues with both players coming over here. Hamels has the ability to veto some trades and he as already done so, blocking a trade to Toronto earlier in the season. Pabelbon's vested option for next year is a huge obstacle. I don't think Philly trades him unless they get a giant piece in return and I don't think we trade for him unless Philly eats a huge chunk of salary over the next year and a half Kazmir/Clipparrd - This one seems to make the most sense but call this one a hunch. I think AA is looking for a front of the rotation starter and I don't think Kazmir fits the bill. Also, I just don't see Beane going blockbuster with us again so soon. Admittedly, the logic isn't as strong on this one and it wouldn't be entirely surprising. We did have scouts at Kazmir's last start.     IMO, if a deal happens, it happens with somebody we may not see coming.  Now, this next section bear in mind, will all be in the ""would be unexpected but not entirely farfetched"" category  Top of the rotation guys that could see action - Jordan   Zimmerman (I don't think they work out a contract. Even during a playoff run I believe he is on the table at the deadline)  Jeff Samardzija (I think sox are both buyers and sellers and see what suits their needs best. I think we are more comfortable giving up our big, young names because of the time on the contract here. Of course, not the best season thus far).  Bullpen guys who make sense - Grilli, K-Rod, Robertson  The, blow up the baseball world, stop the presses, almost certainly won't happen but......MIIIIIGGGGHHHT.....guy  Chris Sale (Remeber, I don't actually think this is going to happen. This is just an ""ohohoho but if it does..."" thing."
Torontobluejays,3btimc,CNDNFighter,2,Thu Jul 2 06:25:15 2015 UTC,No mixing and matching allowed?   Can't get Chapman and Hamels?

Torontobluejays,3btimc,cozeners,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:03:52 2015 UTC,I think Hamels/Papelbon... I think.  I don't care too much about Papelbon but I'd love to have a Hamels on the Jays for a few years going forward. That's a lot of money to be paying him for a lot of years though and any deal to Toronto probably includes the Jays picking up that option year. It depends on how much money Philly is picking up in the deal.  Cueto/Chapman will just cost way too much in prospects. Kazmir/Clippard doesn't excite me much in terms of a big improvement for this year.
Torontobluejays,3btimc,Qwyjibo_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:04:21 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty much in the same boat.  Hamels/Papelbon doesn't just improve the Jays this year.  If Hamels can be reduced to $17-$18 million per year, I think that's pretty damn good."

Torontobluejays,3bs1g7,allirow,7,Wed Jul 1 18:06:33 2015 UTC,Which deals and for who?   Telling us fans he almost did it means things are probably tight right now and wants us to know he's trying
Torontobluejays,3bs1g7,brownmagician,2,Wed Jul 1 18:13:09 2015 UTC,Hamels would make sense. It's been reported that he didn't want to come to Toronto (in the offseason if I remember correctly) and the Blue Jays weren't doing particularly great in May.
Torontobluejays,3bs1g7,tvismyfriend,3,Wed Jul 1 18:37:17 2015 UTC,Could you imagine a pitcher like Hamels with the average run support we've been giving our starting five the last few weeks?
Torontobluejays,3bs1g7,thursday51,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:51:54 2015 UTC,"Oh it would be insane. I could still see him saying no to a trade here though. If his contract was up at the end of the year it would be a no-brainer to come here and try for a push at the playoffs, but you have to wonder how many more years our offence has left in it and if that would affect his decision."
Torontobluejays,3bs1g7,tvismyfriend,2,Wed Jul 1 20:26:30 2015 UTC,"I think building around JD will make this a legit offense for several more years. Add the arms on the way too and he would be joining an up and coming rotation with some real possibilities in the pen. I also don't see Jose completely falling off over the next few years and I think Travis could turn out to be a real special player. EE may or may not age gracefully because of his back, but I think a move to full time DH will help a ton...once we stop wedging Navarro in there."
Torontobluejays,3bs1g7,thursday51,2,Wed Jul 1 20:36:55 2015 UTC,Telling your players that you tried to trade them but a deal fell through would be incredibly dumb.
Torontobluejays,3bs1g7,toenailclipping,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:37:33 2015 UTC,Not necessarily...think of last year when AA couldn't make a move and how it deflated the whole team. Injuries probably had a bigger impact on the late year tailspin but it sure didn't help. I think knowing that management was actively trying to improve the team would be a boost to morale.
Torontobluejays,3bs1g7,thursday51,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:49:03 2015 UTC,Fine. But you're still not going to leak who you tried to move.
Torontobluejays,3bs1g7,toenailclipping,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:47:12 2015 UTC,I hear ya. But if it was prospects and money you were trying to move to get established players I think it would go over well.

Thank god he didn't trade Pillar.  Not only would we not have Pillar, but he likely wouldn't have traded Gose to get Travis."
Torontobluejays,3bs1g7,Garrison_Creeker,2,Wed Jul 1 20:54:03 2015 UTC,He traded Gose because he had confidence in Pompey. Pillar did not enter into it I don't think. He was viewed as borderline on the roster.

Torontobluejays,3brs24,allirow,13,Wed Jul 1 17:38:12 2015 UTC,1) It's Canada day.  You have to start Martin by law.  2) Navarro caught yesterday.  Catchers rarely go back to back games when it's a night/day switch.   3) DINGERS!
Torontobluejays,3brs24,Qwyjibo_,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:02:45 2015 UTC,Martin caught Burhle last time too though.
Torontobluejays,3brs24,cbarone1,9,Wed Jul 1 18:06:01 2015 UTC,Because having a personal catcher is silly. Martin is a much better player than Navarro so there's no need to restrict yourself that way in terms of lineups.
Torontobluejays,3brs24,cbarone1,3,Wed Jul 1 17:24:54 2015 UTC,"It looks more like they're using Navarro for Estrada; He's caught him the last three times.  It could also be coincidence, if they're just using Navarro when they have a night game before a day game."
Torontobluejays,3bq6wt,Vranak,9,Wed Jul 1 06:54:45 2015 UTC,"We're catching a break for sure, but if we won we'd be first or so. Plus this favours Boston overall, as they're clawing back in. Fuck Boston."
Torontobluejays,3bq6wt,StormOfSwords,6,Wed Jul 1 07:44:52 2015 UTC,"It makes it so much more frustrating, especially since we lost games we could have won. We didn't get shelled, we didn't blow it late, our league leading offense just couldn't scrape together 4 runs on Monday and 5 yesterday. Obviously I get that we're not going to score 5 runs every game, but it would be nice if we could do it occasionally when we really need it."
Torontobluejays,3bq6wt,cbarone1,5,Wed Jul 1 12:55:39 2015 UTC,That makes it less frustrating for me. We just flat out got beat. We didn't beat ourselves by blowing a lead or pitching badly. That's what happens in baseball sadly.
Torontobluejays,3bq6wt,el_gumbo,0,Wed Jul 1 14:15:22 2015 UTC,"I can understand that point of view. But I'd rather see our offense be more efficient, for lack of a better term. If we're going to lose a game and give up, say, 12 runs, I'd rather lose 12-1 or 12-2 than 12-9, then win a few more games like last night's or Monday's game. Obviously it doesn't work that way, but in an ideal situation, while also understanding the realities of baseball, that's what I'd prefer to be happening, which is why losing these games is so frustrating for me."

Torontobluejays,3btinn,purelithium,2,Thu Jul 2 02:06:18 2015 UTC,"Saunders is a lemon and I don't like Colabello on D, so for me it was a personal pick between Valencia and Carrera"
Torontobluejays,3btinn,Mapleleaf97,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:28:56 2015 UTC,The 1B/LF position will most likely be determined by the opposing SP(Lefty or Righty)  At home SP: Drew Hutchinson  LF: Collabello/Saunders  1B: Smoak  DH: EDWIN
Torontobluejays,3btinn,kushblazers,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:04:38 2015 UTC,Wildcard games are against other AL teams so there will be a DH for sure.

It's the team's biggest game in 22 years, win or go home, you don't risk putting a kid in that spot.  1B) EE or Smoak, depending on opp. pitcher. (EE DH and Smoak 1B if its a righty, EE 1B and Valencia DH if its a lefty)  LF) Colabello."

Torontobluejays,3bsl8a,nocturnal_goatsucker,4,Wed Jul 1 20:26:35 2015 UTC,Just read this on bleacher report. Seems like Norris getting his mojo back. AA looking to make a trade soon?
Torontobluejays,3bsl8a,kushblazers,5,Wed Jul 1 22:07:21 2015 UTC,"30 days before the deadline.  AA likes to work fast, I imagine if we make a deal it'll be before the 31st."
Torontobluejays,3bsl8a,allirow,2,Wed Jul 1 22:31:56 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking is this the season Jays should go ""all in""? If AA brings in a SP/RP we are going to have to potentially part with 1-3 prospects depending the caliber of player we get. I'd almost rather just chill and wait the season out. Maybe sign a FA during the off season. We have Donaldson under control for about 3 years and our farm is stocked with nice pitchers. Next year we will have a healthy Stroman which will change the dynamic of our rotation. I think AA should continue to just be patient unless an amazing deal comes up."
Torontobluejays,3bsl8a,kushblazers,2,Wed Jul 1 22:36:30 2015 UTC,"We can't bank on prospects to deliver though.  They could, but for every Drew Hutchison or (so far) Aaron Sanchez and Roberto Osuna, there's a J.P. Arencibia, Kyle Drabek, and Moises Sierra.  Do you trade high upside uncertainty for (expensive) certainty like Hamels & Papelbon?  It's a difficult position to be in.  I don't envy AA over the next month."
Torontobluejays,3bsl8a,allirow,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:42:08 2015 UTC,If we are going to go big I would rather go after Cueto and Chapman.
Torontobluejays,3bsl8a,kushblazers,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:46:30 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't so much that we'll lose control of our core as much that our core will decline. Donaldson will be 30 next year and he's the youngest out of Martin, Reyes, Bautista, Encarnacion, and Dickey. It's almost a guarantee that those six, collectively, will be worse and/or less healthy next year."
Torontobluejays,3bsl8a,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:34:31 2015 UTC,"That core collectively depreciating is still one of the most potent lineups in the game even in terms of next season. Factor in all our pitchers healthy like Stroman and Sanchez with addition of Norris and Farm options I can confidently say next season Jays will have more wins. Younger pitchers like Sanchez, Osuna, Castro, and Boyd will have more experience. Not to mention if AA signs a SP during the off season. That is why I still think we shouldn't over pay for a SP to benefit the short run."
Torontobluejays,3bsl8a,kushblazers,3,Thu Jul 2 00:53:05 2015 UTC,"I can confidently say next season Jays will have more wins.   RemindMe! 15 Months  I like your optimism but you can't rely on health. The average MLB team has 1/6 of its active roster on the DL at any one time and most injuries are in March/April. This year, we escaped alright - we only lost one frontline player for the season (Stroman) and every other injury was short-term or acceptably filled from depth. Next year, we can only hope to be so lucky."
Torontobluejays,3bsl8a,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:14:38 2015 UTC,"Going to have to disagree with you when you say we escaped alright in terms of injuries. Stroman inj really messed us because we had to bring along Sanchez faster. We could of used him as a closer for a bit longer and that in turn may have allowed Castro a bit more time to grow. Sanchez current inj, Bautista shoulder, Saunders,  and Devon Travis? True fact Jays still haven't played with their full roster healthy half way through the season."
Torontobluejays,3bsl8a,kushblazers,3,Thu Jul 2 01:40:20 2015 UTC,True fact Jays still haven't played with their full roster healthy half way through the season.   Almost no teams ever play with a full healthy roster. It's almost impossible for all frontline players to stay healthy at the same time.  We've been about average for injuries and this team needs to be built to compete when relying on backups.
Torontobluejays,3bsl8a,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:53:18 2015 UTC,Yes but we lost some important players for long periods of time due to freak accidents. I know that the MLB season is 120+ games and that people do get hurt. But there is a huge difference in losing a SP and a position player. Losing a dominant SP can cost you about 10-15 wins in a regular season if you factor in the other SP having to shoulder the burden.
Torontobluejays,3bsl8a,kushblazers,2,Thu Jul 2 07:23:28 2015 UTC,162 games plus spring training and.playoffs.

Torontobluejays,3bpejh,Born_Ruff,8,Wed Jul 1 16:02:35 2015 UTC,Estrada was a disaster and the offense did poorly enough to just lose. It's too bad because it wasn't even a great pitching performance like Buchholz yesterday. Just poor at bats all around.
Torontobluejays,3bpejh,Qwyjibo_,2,Wed Jul 1 02:16:30 2015 UTC,"Man, that Travis error had a hugely disproportionate impact on the game. It directly cost the two runs in the first (which was the difference in the game) and caused Estrada to throw an extra 20 pitches. Without that error I don't think he's so worried about walks and he doesn't groove the pitches that resulted in the homers.  The whole game just felt flat after that."
Torontobluejays,3bpejh,ExplainsSocialEnigma,2,Wed Jul 1 03:53:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Estrada allowed so few baserunners in his previous 2 starts that he hasn't pitched from the set a lot.   That error means he couldn't use his full windup anymore, so perhaps that destabilized his mechanics and led to lots of walks in the 1st inning"
Torontobluejays,3bpejh,Xzar23,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:46:38 2015 UTC,how much time do you give Travis to get back into form? Goins was hitting ok and playing great defensively.

Torontobluejays,3bpejh,mtrnka,3,Wed Jul 1 07:43:20 2015 UTC,"Goins really wasn't hitting okay. In fact, in the month of June (if you take away the Boston series where he hit .400+) he was hitting .150ish."

Torontobluejays,3bnaoo,DoubleONine,5,Tue Jun 30 17:10:45 2015 UTC,"At least one theory is the Raptors' season fell apart this year after Kyle Lowry played the All-Star game instead of resting up. Am I worrying too much about this happening to the Jays? A little R&R and time away from travel isn't such a bad thing.   Like, what do we want more: an All Star team, or a pennant?"
Torontobluejays,3bnaoo,drmarcj,5,Tue Jun 30 19:58:27 2015 UTC,"Lowry was battling injuries for a long time --longer than I think he was letting on, and even predating the all star game.  In fact, his game tailed off after the first third of a season even before DeMar came back.  So I don't think that a few days off would have helped.  Also, nothing about the way Donaldson is playing that would suggest he is already hurt."

Torontobluejays,3bo7u6,StevenAlonso,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:51:12 2015 UTC,I don't think either starter is long for this game
Torontobluejays,3bnkfv,Josh_Dongerson,2,Tue Jun 30 17:30:46 2015 UTC,"Pruitt fits the Jays' profile to a tee, as a very projectable but high risk high school outfielder with the tools to be a good defensive CF. His standout ability is his speed -- among the best in the draft -- rated a 60 on the 20-80 scouting scale by Kiley McDaniel's rankings at FanGraphs and 70 by MLB.com. Splitting the difference, that would put him roughly in the highest 10% at the MLB level. He has a good arm in the outfield, recorded as high as 93 MPH on throws, and is considered to have good fielding instincts.  The bat is the big question mark, with the consensus being that his swing is choppy, can get started late, and can get long at times. There will be a lot of work to do now that he's in pro ball, and a complete overhaul may be necessary. Unfortunately, the Jays don't really have a great track record successfully doing this in recent years, but Pruitt does have some strong building blocks with good hand-eye coordination and good bat speed due to fast twitch hands. So there's the potential to hit for average, and he could grow into some decent, if still below average, power.   So a less toolsy DJ Davis."
Torontobluejays,3bnkfv,allirow,0,Tue Jun 30 17:39:02 2015 UTC,Six years away
Torontobluejays,3bnkfv,Snidernomore,4,Tue Jun 30 18:09:33 2015 UTC,two years away from being two years away
Torontobluejays,3bnkfv,deadskin,2,Tue Jun 30 22:13:30 2015 UTC,"I don't understand these ""signing bonuses""... Does this guy actually get $500,000 just for signing? Even if he never plays a game even in A Ball, he gets that money? How does that work exactly? Seems ridiculous to me. I must not understand this very well."
Torontobluejays,3bnkfv,cozeners,7,Tue Jun 30 18:58:11 2015 UTC,"The $500K was to sign him away from a Vanderbilt commitment. Highly ranked high school prospects get big bonuses because they usually have full ride scholarships to play college ball and if they're successful in college can go in the first few rounds and get more $$$. If Pruitt went to Vandy and played really well he'd be a first rounder in 2-3 years and get millions.  The Jays took him in the 24th round because the talent pool is usually pretty low on day 3 and he was still available. For a high ranked prospect still on the board at that point, not signing is almost a given, and they wanted to try and negotiate with him. I'm really surprised he signed, especially since he said during the draft that he was going to Vandy 100%"
Torontobluejays,3bnkfv,cozeners,2,Tue Jun 30 19:08:18 2015 UTC,"Makes a little more sense. But like you said, he's going to get ""millions"" only if he plays well. Seems like such a crapshoot for these teams that apparently have money to burn."
Torontobluejays,3bnkfv,allirow,6,Tue Jun 30 19:12:55 2015 UTC,"He'd get millions if he plays well in college, but thats a big if. It's just as possible that he burns out at Vandy, quits baseball, and takes a job doing whatever he was studying. The Jays made a gamble at $500K hoping he pans out, and if he does it'll be a huge bargain. If he doesn't then it's $500K down the drain, but it was the right move at the time.  In 2013 AA took Rowdy Tellez in the 30th round and signed him for $850K, and he has put up good numbers so far. Hopefully Pruitt can do it too."
Torontobluejays,3bnkfv,greenlemon23,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:18:55 2015 UTC,is Tellez the guy who was playing in a beer league?!
Torontobluejays,3bnkfv,cbarone1,2,Wed Jul 1 01:35:24 2015 UTC,"No, Tellez was a highly rated high school prospect. Bo Schultz played beer league, but he wasn't our prospect. The only guy with an interesting story in the Jays organization I can think of is Roemon Fields. He worked at a post office and a Lids franchise before signing with the Jays."
Torontobluejays,3bnkfv,allirow,3,Wed Jul 1 04:11:57 2015 UTC,"That's his signing bonus.  It's the blue jays financial commitment to him.  It's sizeable for someone drafted so late because he was not expected to sign due to his college commitment.  He likely would've been drafted in the first 7 rounds otherwise.   One also has to keep in mind that the minor leagues pay fuck all.  At the lowest level, he's probably making $6k-8k a year.  Triple A maxes out at around $16k per year.  A draftees signing bonus is essentially their livable money till they hit the bigs."
Torontobluejays,3bnkfv,cbarone1,2,Tue Jun 30 19:11:51 2015 UTC,"I believe some guys in AAA actually make upwards of 100k, but those are vets on minor league deals, not guys who are still on the contract they signed when they were drafted."
Torontobluejays,3bnkfv,allirow,2,Tue Jun 30 21:00:43 2015 UTC,"According to a Bleacher Report...  report... from last year, the typical AAA salary is $2,150/month."
Torontobluejays,3bnkfv,cbarone1,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:50:58 2015 UTC,While they play.   So it's closer to $12k per year.

Torontobluejays,3bmurj,HW_Plainview,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:16:33 2015 UTC,"That's kind the Royals' strategy (and to a lesser extent the Rays) - tolerate weak back-of-the-rotation starters, pull them early (like after 18 batters) and turn it over to a deep bullpen. Ideally, put a good innings-eater between your weak starters so as to avoid concentrating the load on the bullpen."

There have to be deals out there for players with more control if you're dealing multiple top pitching prospects. Whether it's Hamels or some other guy that hasn't even been rumoured yet."

Torontobluejays,3bn4lw,DTWinnipeg,3,Tue Jun 30 15:39:04 2015 UTC,"Best bet is on stub hub.    Since your last game they have since renovated and have the 2nd level West Jet Flight Deck.  It's the bar section above the outfield, just under the jumbo tron where anyone with a ticket can stand.  If you get nosebleeds, head down there and experience the game from there.    Enjoy the game."
Torontobluejays,3bn4lw,dnovi,2,Tue Jun 30 15:56:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know what the prices are like on stub hub but to in terms of face value the best tickets under $50 are either the 1st level outfield or the 2nd level behind the bases, IMO. If you do the outfield seats, be careful not to sit in the top 3-4 rows because then you can't really see the ball if it goes in the air."
Torontobluejays,3bn4lw,Bluejays1,2,Tue Jun 30 16:46:49 2015 UTC,you can always get there early (before first pitch) with 500 seats and just get a good spot in the standing area in the 200 level outfield. they've been giving ponchos away to the people out there lately for some reason too!

That's a pretty good price if you can snatch it up now.  Edit:  There's also some decent field level base seats, one set in LF, one set in RF, row 2/3 for about $34 USD on StubHub.

Torontobluejays,3bjo2k,teckhz,10,Mon Jun 29 19:48:54 2015 UTC,You think Cherry caused 75% of Donaldson's votes? Highly doubtful.
