The egg was hidden in the depths of the bowl, and I personally didn't care for the amount of green onions they put in it by default.   But still, a solid bowl of Ramen nevertheless. Having tried the Tsukemen at Tsujita LA Annex, I am now biased towards the thick and delicious noodles."

ramen,3e0ty8,brinbran,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:45:30 2015 UTC,I didn't have the annex ramen but the tsukemen at the main tsujita was actually too rich.  So overwhelming that a single lime didn't do anything to bring out any subtlety in the broth other than salt and savory.
ramen,3e0ty8,themacdaddy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:44:24 2015 UTC,"this broth is even heavier. it's delicious, but you're meat stoned afterwards"

ramen,3dzy1l,Rotorist,2,Mon Jul 20 22:02:16 2015 UTC,"First off, that bowl of ramen looks pretty great!  I haven't made chicken paitan, but I'd imagine that you'd want more bones that what you used if you really want cloudiness. If you have a pressure cooker, you could do the two step method of pressure cooking the bones for an hour to extract a lot of gelatin, then boiling at a rolling boil for an hour or two to emulsify.   Googling around, apparently Serious Eats did a turkey paitan:  http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/11/the-food-lab-thanksgiving-turkey-ramen-with-crisp-shredded-turkey-and-slow-cooked-egg.html"
ramen,3dzy1l,ramen_minion,2,Tue Jul 21 00:21:07 2015 UTC,"Nice! Haven't seen that style here in awhile.  I do paitan for butter corn miso, and recently did a classic paitan in the shio style. Me and paitan are definitely buddies.  I don't roast the bones. In fact I don't even blanch them, I just soak them for a few hours in cold water to remove some excess myoglobin. Drain, then boil for around 6 hours. Any residual fat not emulsified quickly whips into shape after putting an immersion blender into the mix post straining. Just looking for clean creamy chicken flavor.  Last go around I used 4 lbs chicken backs, 6 chicken wings, and around 3 lbs chicken feet. Last hour I pitched aromatics. Really simple, super easy, very tasty.  I'll release a more detailed recipe in the future if there's interest. Honestly this recipe is one of my favorites (maybe right behind miso) so I'm excited to share."
ramen,3dzy1l,Ramen_Lord,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:23:26 2015 UTC,I'd be curious to hear more about the residual fat. Is that something that is unique to paitan?
ramen,3dzy1l,Slogo,2,Tue Jul 21 16:40:55 2015 UTC,"Pretty consistent with all forms of broth making, but especially ones where you have higher fat content body parts. The liquid on your home stove can only boil so rapidly. Some of that fat that renders out is just gonna sit on the surface, no matter what you do.   I noticed that if I boiled the contents uncovered for the last hour, as part of trying to draw some excess moisture out, it boiled a little more aggressively and seemed to help emulsify things.  But really, a handblender did the best job. Broth that was white but slicked with fat turned into a gorgeous cream consistency, with the faintest hint of yellow from the chicken fat. Never going to do another tonkotsu or paitan without finishing it with a handblender."

ramen,3dwlxw,h2g2Ben,2,Mon Jul 20 14:44:47 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but having done this before - there are a couple of likely methods.   Preheat oven to 350 F. Put a little oil in a pan and heat it up.  Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper.  Put chicken in pan, skin side down for about 5 minutes. Flip chicken once the skin is crispy and brown.  Put chicken in oven for ~15 until cooked through.   Timing will vary based on a lot of things. Get a good digital meat thermometer."

ramen,3dwlxw,longishere,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:34:53 2015 UTC,Can I get the noodle recipe? I've been trying different recipes. Everything looks great btw.
ramen,3dwlxw,longishere,3,Mon Jul 20 13:13:44 2015 UTC,"Super easy - 1 cup bread flour, 1 tsp ""baked"" baking powder (put it on parchment paper in a 250F oven for an hour), and 50 ml water.  Dissolve baked baking powder in water, then add it to your flour.  Try not to touch the baking powder with your hands - some people's skin is sensitive to it.  You should see the flour start to turn yellow.  Mix with a wooden spoon until the liquid is incorporated.  The dough will be VERY tough to work with.  Keep working it.  When it's more or less uniform cover it in cling wrap and let it sit for an hour.  Then you a pasta machine to make your noodles!  When cooking them they should only take about 60-90 sec to cook - no longer than that."

ramen,3dx1kp,CaseH1984,2,Mon Jul 20 06:19:16 2015 UTC,Probably tradition since meat is expensive in other parts of the world and eggs are a good source of protein.
ramen,3dx1kp,anotherbadusername,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:57:43 2015 UTC,"I prefer chicken; beef is probably fine. Just try it man. I was a little hesitant at first too but it's great.  My recipe is to crack an egg after I cook the noodles in boiling water (at this point, can even turn heat off as the broth is hot enough to cook the egg) and mix it in to add protein but also body to the broth. Then I like to add a little sriracha and soy sauce for a little more complex flavor. At this point you can toss in other proteins and veggies but that's my basic go-to to make the instant noodles just a little more special."

ramen,3dt7ez,mingl,5,Sun Jul 19 05:39:08 2015 UTC,"You all have inspired me! Have been seeing such delicious batches of ramen, especially the homemade stuff.  I'm going to start experimenting with broth and accompaniments next, but wanted to try my hand at the noodles.    Surprisingly easy recipe, 1 cup bread flour, 1 tsp ""baked"" baking soda (250F oven for an hour to make it even more alkaline), and 50 ml water.  It leads to an incredibly tough dough that's really hard to work with - after it's kneaded, cover it and let it sit for an hour.  Then make your noodles!    Thanks for the great pics I've been seeing in this subreddit - just found this subreddit recently it's made me really hungry..."
ramen,3dt7ez,aliaf,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:47:04 2015 UTC,"Interesting, verdict on the noodles? Were they chewy? What would you change next time? I always wanted to make it but without alkaline water thought it'd be a bit hard to get the texture right.  Thanks."
ramen,3dt7ez,happysealND,4,Sun Jul 19 06:32:01 2015 UTC,"Thought the noodles turned out great! Springy and nicely chewy. During the process I was a bit worried because the dough it was incredibly difficult to work with (but I had been warned that it's difficult).  Like, I had to push with my full body down on the rolling pin to squish it down an 1/8th of an inch.  Made it very difficult to knead. After I had let the dough rest though it was amazing to see the dough come together nicely.  The toughness of the dough helps create that nice texture.    I made a lot so now I'm experimenting with storing as well (some in fridge, some drying on counter, and some in freezer)."
ramen,3dt7ez,utopianfiat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:13:52 2015 UTC,"I may try this, but could you explain the baked baking soda"
ramen,3dt7ez,Rrrrbbbb,4,Sun Jul 19 09:06:50 2015 UTC,"Baking Soda is sodium bicarbonate = NaHCO3  Between 50C (122F) and 200C (392F) NaHCO3 undergoes thermal decomposition to Sodium Carbonate, Na2CO3. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_bicarbonate#Thermal_decomposition  Sodium Carbonate (""washing soda"") is decently alkaline (pKb =~ 3.5) as opposed to Sodium Bicarbonate which is weakly acidic (pKa =~ 10). It's often used in place of sodium hydroxide for lyeing.  Alternatively, if you live near a japanese or large general asian supermarket, grab yourself some ""kansui"" or ""lye water"".  The basic lye water encourages the formation of gluten strands in the dough, and gives ramen noodles their bouncy texture and yellowish color. While it's kind of optional if you have a pasta roller like OP and I, or if you're going to do knife-cut soba, it's absolutely essential if you're trying to do hand-pulled lamian."
ramen,3dt7ez,happysealND,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:59:06 2015 UTC,It allows the noodles to stay firm and not turn to mush while in a hot broth for longer periods of time.
ramen,3dt7ez,Rrrrbbbb,2,Sun Jul 19 12:44:58 2015 UTC,"Ahh interesting, my question was actually poorly worded sorry. How do I actually go about baking it. Is this common practice?"
ramen,3dt7ez,Ramen_Lord,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:06:40 2015 UTC,Just spread the baking soda on a baking sheet with parchment paper and put it in the oven!
ramen,3dt7ez,synt4x,2,Sun Jul 19 13:15:38 2015 UTC,"Really cool. Nicely done.  Something to note: since you have an electric crank pasta roller, you can actually use the roller as your kneading device.  Combine your flour/water/ salts as per normal, allow to sit and hydrate, covered, for around 30 minutes. Even hydration makes rolling noodles much easier, and time is your friend for this. (Which is why I enjoy using a food processor to combine everything, but that's another conversation). Most online recipes have higher hydration, but they don't combine evenly or allow for long enough autolyse. Just waiting a bit will make things easier.  Once hydrated, lump up the dough into a solid mass. Take a clump you can work with, and press it with a palm or rolling pin down to around 3/4 inch thick. You can now pass this through the rollers, decreasing the size, and then folding the dough over itself. Repeat this process 2-3 times or until the machine is working heavily. Tada, kneaded, with almost no effort on your part.  There are several benefits to this method, which is why it's common in an industrial setting:   It's fast. Gluten development happens quickly because the machine applies more force than you can with a rolling pin. It allows you to control the alignment of the gluten strands. In an ideal noodle, the gluten forms almost a grain, like meat's muscle fibers, along the length of the noodle. This helps give that chew, as your teeth crush through these long strands of gluten. Your dough is essentially rolled this way. Once you've done this kneading, you can test the dough, and then all that's left to do is gradually decrease the thickness to your liking and cut. You get a layering effect, with layers of dough pressed together, as part of the sheeted together. Also adds to the final texture, and is sort of a hallmark of Japanese noodle making. (Classic udon kneading involves this folding/pressing method as well)."
ramen,3dt7ez,Ramen_Lord,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:46:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks!!!  Thanks for the kneading trick - seriously was worried about the dough mid-process.  Should save a lot of sweat :D  We don't have a food processor, but I've been making a lot of pasta recently (though obviously this is my first ramen attempt).   It seems like it's a valuable addition in the kitchen though and it seems like you'd recommend it too?"
ramen,3dt7ez,CaseH1984,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:56:38 2015 UTC,"until the machine is working heavily   Be super careful with pushing an ""artisan"" model Kitchenaid made in the last 10-15 years with the pasta roller attachment. They have a plastic gear designed to fail under too much load. I've killed 4 Kitchenaids with the pasta roller (you think I would have learned better), and I've gotten to talk through the failure mode a lot with customer support."

ramen,3doyf7,Ramen_Lord,5,Sat Jul 18 01:44:28 2015 UTC,"Tl;dr, absolute trash. Will never try again.  I LIKE furious spoon. I supported their kick starter. I really enjoyed their miso bowl back when they opened. Solid miso flavor, broth texture was fantastic, and the noodles were solid, with an almost taut level of chew. And more than anything, their miso ramen was blazing hot, a furious caldron of fatty goodness indeed. The experience of Furious Spoon is one of few in the city that felt ""right.""  This tsukemen? None of those things.  The broth was tepid, a mess. It tasted like gelatinous braising liquid, with no complexity or overt flavor to speak of. Big soy sauce flavor, muted meat and pork. Salt and sticky, with nothing to please the palate. This combination of temperature, over salting, and lack of complexity, created an extremely off-putting broth. Borderline gross.  The noodles, doused in salt, only further destroyed any semblance of flavor. They had great big texture and the right amount of alkalinity, and their larger cut was exciting, but with all the salt, the delicate flavor of these wheat forward noodles was lost entirely. Further, buried beneath sharp green onion and pungent nori, which got everywhere, there was no ""noodle"" flavor to speak of. For a dish like tsukemen, the noodle and its flavor are so key, almost more important than the broth. It needs to be fresh and chewy, but wheat forward, not too alkaline, and full of presence. Here, beneath the salt and the flavorless salty broth, it just couldn't get recognized.   Chashu was nice tho.  To say I was disappointed is an understatement. This is a travesty, it sets ramen back. People will try this and never want to try tsukemen again.  Damn Furious Spoon, how did you fuck up so bad?   Guess I need to develop a tsukemen recipe... The struggle continues."
ramen,3doyf7,fightingforair,2,Sat Jul 18 01:55:32 2015 UTC,I agree that the soup came up short.  Thickness was good but flavor was lacking. No fish flavor at all present nor yuzu.  Just a over salty pork brown thing.  Definitely needs work.
ramen,3doyf7,goldfool,0,Sat Jul 18 12:08:39 2015 UTC,"One day when someone recommends a Tsukemen in NYC i might try it. Last time I did it was a tasting with  alot of known Ramen chefs.

Maybe a hot plate would work... then people would get burned and sue."
ramen,3doty8,goldfool,5,Sat Jul 18 01:02:16 2015 UTC,So I went in and the kitchen staff(chef especially) was very up beat.  The bowl of ramen had a HUGE amount of noodles. I am not totally sold on putting raw garlic on the side though. If you put as part of the tare roasted garlic paste.. that I would love.   The very top had a mixture of fat and looked like drippings from the pork. I believe they were keeping the pork hot in the soup pot.. or it was a slow braise/blow.   I would give it a 8 out of 10. Mainly because I am more of a soup person then noodle. The noodles were very good and I do tend to prefer think to thin.

I happen to go to bassanova(second time eating there) 2 days later and had the curry ramen there. The Noodles are thicker and seems to absorb more of the flavor then most other ramen noodles(baring Jiro sytle). I would like to mesh the curry with the thicker noodles.

ramen,3djzju,Mcash39,2,Fri Jul 17 08:11:26 2015 UTC,It's a Japanese fish cake.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamaboko

ramen,3dg87u,Sempereternity,3,Thu Jul 16 00:54:45 2015 UTC,"Saw this bowl, thought ""hey! I wanna make this for dinner!"" then came across this recipe  ...maybe i'll try this one weekend"
ramen,3dg87u,anonymau5,3,Thu Jul 16 01:41:37 2015 UTC,Damn this is awesome
ramen,3dg87u,Kappadar,2,Thu Jul 16 20:20:30 2015 UTC,"My favourite ramen place in the city by far. I live about an hour north, so I'm wildly jealous right now."
ramen,3dg87u,Idiotechnicality,2,Thu Jul 16 11:21:49 2015 UTC,My bf is taking me here when I visit him next month. I hear it's great and I can't be any more excited for ramen (that's not in Japan) ___
ramen,3dg87u,ghouli,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:46:32 2015 UTC,"My boyfriend and I ordered different broths so that we could try eachothers haha. He got shoyu and it was great, a LOT different than what I had. It was super cheap too, even with 2 appetizers and some specialty drinks. It's the perfect date place :)"
ramen,3dg87u,wasted_viaticum,2,Thu Jul 16 23:40:09 2015 UTC,The girl and I ate at Sansotei when we visited in May. I would make the drive from Detroit again just to eat here.
ramen,3dg87u,corntorteeya,2,Thu Jul 16 19:48:14 2015 UTC,Looks good. Gyoza is fine without an s to pluralize.
ramen,3dg87u,beeteeoh,2,Fri Jul 17 00:25:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed, this is the best Tonkotsu in Toronto!"
ramen,3dg87u,ngtstkr,2,Sat Jul 18 02:08:03 2015 UTC,This is my favourite bowl of ramen in Toronto. I like hitting up the Yonge street location because there is never a wait. The Dundas location frequently has a line out the door.
ramen,3dg87u,ngtstkr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:37:50 2015 UTC,Oh god yeah we waited in line for 20ish minutes. Nothing compared to waiting in line for an uncle tetsu cheesecake right after though lol. I had no idea they had other locations! I intend to try as many different ramen places as I can in Toronto
ramen,3dg87u,xDialtone,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:51:51 2015 UTC,"Be sure to try Santouka at Church and Dundas. They have the best ramen noodles in the city; they also have the best gyoza. Sansotei has the best broth. Also, check out the spicy garlic ramen at Kinton. It's really unique and super delicious."
ramen,3dg87u,Realscience666,2,Thu Jul 16 19:30:17 2015 UTC,"Ramen looks good, but eggs looked slightly overcooked.  Those potstickers/gyoza  look awesome."
ramen,3dg87u,xDialtone,2,Thu Jul 16 01:36:50 2015 UTC,The egg looks perfect to me
ramen,3dij1e,aleksanderlawl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:32:36 2015 UTC,I thought my local stores just stopped stocking them. They went out of business? I grew up on Unif. Been looking for a replacement ever since the stores ran out.   Mama beef seems very similar to the beef Unif. Same style of noodle at least. Not found something to match their shrimp style yet though.
ramen,3dcep2,crazycoffin,7,Wed Jul 15 04:23:39 2015 UTC,"This was their ""classic"" (Oiimen), which ia assume is analogous to tonkotsu. Very sticky, rich, fatty broth, some shredded green onion, soft boiled egg, bean sprouts, pork belly. Super rich and delicious, with some good tooth to the noodles.  My girlfriend got the pozolmen, which was like a Mexican ramen with jalapeños, hominy, radish, pork belly, and lime. It was also extremely tasty and rather spicy."
ramen,3dcep2,fightingforair,2,Wed Jul 15 04:26:43 2015 UTC,They have decent ramen.  Wish they marinaded their eggs.
ramen,3dcep2,Upstagemalarky,4,Wed Jul 15 14:22:58 2015 UTC,Yes the egg isn't great and the ramen is just ok.  I'm currently addicted to High Five so I may be biased :)
ramen,3dcep2,coocookuhchoo,3,Wed Jul 15 15:46:16 2015 UTC,How are the noodles?  They look suspiciously white and spaghetti-like.
ramen,3dcep2,Harasoluka,2,Wed Jul 15 22:12:06 2015 UTC,"We rather liked both, but we don't have the chance to eat a lot of fresh ramen."
ramen,3dcep2,Ramen_Lord,2,Wed Jul 15 16:34:23 2015 UTC,Hey I live here!   All of us Chicago ramen-ers should get together and ramen sometime. Are meet ups a thing in this community?
ramen,3dcep2,Harasoluka,2,Wed Jul 15 19:45:02 2015 UTC,I'm down. That or hosting a ramen night for some cookery.  You think people here would be interested in trying some experimental ramen at my dinky apartment? Have thought about it but sort of like the anonymous nature of things.
ramen,3dcep2,Harasoluka,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:04:14 2015 UTC,That would be so cool! I've always wanted to find someone in the city with my passion for eating ramen. Sharing it with someone that can cook it? Even better.
ramen,3dcep2,Reddit_Executive,2,Thu Jul 16 00:32:26 2015 UTC,"Aw, I'd love to, but I'm actually not a Chicagoan!"

ramen,3ddhuw,WreckyHuman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:30:28 2015 UTC,"Hey, I have that bowl."
ramen,3dck0m,Uedukai,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:15:45 2015 UTC,"It might have something to do with the price increase. If you frequently purchased the 5-pack Nong Shim ramen made in Korea or even the ones made in China, the price has jacked up to at least $6-7 a pack, and that's not even the black version too. Profit margin was really small too, and sales actually did slow down for about a few weeks, so they decided to cut it down to a 4 pack and sell it at around $4 a pack instead.   Now, if you're talking about the cup containers...they have recently rolled out the redesign, so instead of slim tall, it's now short wide. They've actually pushed out that redesign when they released the Soon Veggie and that turned out to be surprisingly popular. I'm going to guess that they're going to keep it at 1 cup design rather than 2 different designs. I believe Nongshim Black changed as well.   As for what's behind the purpose of the redesign, I don't know.   Source? I work for Canada's largest Asian grocery chain ;)"
ramen,3d906p,Kingcrowing,14,Tue Jul 14 13:08:46 2015 UTC,"Oh god damn, fuck that~~~~~  I need to unsubscribe from this sub, every Ramen from Japan looks freaking amazing."

I just found this sub and I think I may try and make some myself if I can find good noodles, instant noodles don't cut it after having this!"

ramen,3d906p,lkjhfj,2,Wed Jul 15 09:21:44 2015 UTC,Which ramen restaulant is the best?
ramen,3d906p,TheLilyHammer,3,Tue Jul 14 13:50:09 2015 UTC,Number two! That was Kikianbo in Akihibara in Tokyo! But any of the tsukemen blew my mind because I'd never had it before going to Japan.
ramen,3d906p,TheLilyHammer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:55:48 2015 UTC,Did you have to open the egg yourself in number 2???
ramen,3d906p,Shloop_Shloop_Splat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:38:28 2015 UTC,"No, it's a softboiled egg and then put in soy sauce or something, so there was no shell on it even though it looks like it."
ramen,3d906p,PeteyCruiser,2,Tue Jul 14 15:47:23 2015 UTC,Very interesting! Right now I'm staring at my small collection of instant ramen packages in disgust.
ramen,3d906p,holyhesus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:53:55 2015 UTC,That one looks particularly amazing. How was the one with the big old hunk of eggplant?
ramen,3d906p,joemomma91,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:51:23 2015 UTC,"IMO that one was the worst, still good but it was really plain. It was an all chicken broth and really subtle - I like the more intensely flavored ones."
ramen,3d906p,Pandaburrs,2,Wed Jul 15 12:13:35 2015 UTC,Is that the shio yuzu ramen from afuri I see there?

ramen,3d906p,sunrisesunbloom,2,Tue Jul 14 16:12:59 2015 UTC,Tsukemen Ramen was my first one in Japan. Never Forget.  Looks like a delicious food venture! Thanks for bringing back the memories T-T
ramen,3d906p,corntorteeya,2,Tue Jul 14 16:53:31 2015 UTC,Tsukemen ramen really needs to get popular here in the US - I absolutely love it and can't recommend it enough.

ramen,3d9h8b,rebelhead,2,Tue Jul 14 15:29:14 2015 UTC,6 minutes! C-c-cold water after that.
ramen,3d9h8b,rebelhead,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:03:20 2015 UTC,"Ahhh ok. I popped it in the freezer for about a minute as the noodles finished cooking, so I'll definitely do cold water next time!  Will have to experiment with cooking time on it though. Only had it in there for 5 minutes!  Thanks for the advice."
ramen,3d9h8b,rebelhead,3,Wed Jul 15 04:24:19 2015 UTC,Freezer is a good idea!  JUUST found this on Imgur: http://imgur.com/gallery/CIlla

ramen,3d6hxq,mindfood84,2,Tue Jul 14 00:49:27 2015 UTC,This was kind of a bastardized recipe I did. Rougly 5 lbs of pork bones.  2.5 lbs of chicken bones 1/4 cup of miso paste 2 table spooons of mirin 12 green onions 2 large leeks 2 large onions 12 cloves of garlic about a 3 inch piece of ginger 8 ounces of mushrooms 2 pods of star Anise(because I can lol)

ramen,3d5ig6,steamtroll,5,Mon Jul 13 18:08:29 2015 UTC,I've had my eye on that book for a while.  How is it?
ramen,3d5ig6,Thunder_Bear,6,Mon Jul 13 21:03:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not OP, but I read the book. It's good. It's not a cook book, but it does have his recipes."
ramen,3d5ig6,CraptainHammer,2,Mon Jul 13 22:33:38 2015 UTC,"That seems to be the new trend.  Momofuku has lots of recipes but is more of a biography.   Regardless, I will have to pick this up."
ramen,3d5ig6,IAmNotAChef,4,Tue Jul 14 12:03:17 2015 UTC,"Like others said half of it is Ivan Orkin's autobiography.  His story is very touching And it has his claim to fame ramen recipe.  His food is DELICIOUS. I've had the opportunity to meet him and hear him speak about this book,  he is a very humble man and cooks wonderful food."
ramen,3d5ig6,Snapple_spatula,3,Tue Jul 14 02:30:58 2015 UTC,i thought the autobiographical part was the highlight of the book - maybe one day i'll make the recipes but reading about his development as a chef and opening his noodle shop in tokyo was  fascinating and totally worth it just for that.
ramen,3d5ig6,PeteyCruiser,2,Tue Jul 14 01:41:57 2015 UTC,"Just got it, so I haven't done much more than flip through it, but it seems pretty cool.   The first hundred pages are about the author/chef and his journey, which is interesting.  I like that kind of book, one that introduces you to the food and the culture surrounding it before diving into the recipes."
ramen,3d5ig6,FideliusXIII,2,Mon Jul 13 22:56:11 2015 UTC,"I bought the book when it first came out in a Japanese bookstore. Really enjoyed reading his autobiography, and I'll flip through his mouthwatering recipes whenever I'm craving ramen (which is pretty often!)."
ramen,3d5alh,Dipz,2,Mon Jul 13 17:14:06 2015 UTC,"I used the Classic Shoyu Recipe in the sidebar and followed it as best I could. The noodles aren't homemade. Those are Sun Brand Shoyu noodles. It took just about all day, but it was worth it. Everyone loved it."

ramen,3d4jku,mhayes32,9,Mon Jul 13 13:44:56 2015 UTC,"I used the cheap stuff, but threw away the flavor packet, cooked bacon in the pot, threw in the noodles and water, put in some miso, green onions, Sriracha and soy sauce. It's fantastic!"
ramen,3d4jku,leetdemon,2,Mon Jul 13 13:47:04 2015 UTC,"sounds great, Ive made about the same but I used the flavor packet as well. Never tried without will have to do."
ramen,3d4jku,cadika_orade,3,Mon Jul 13 14:33:17 2015 UTC,"I usually use the flavor packet, but often I only use half of it. A bit of plain chicken Nissin with sriracha and crack an egg over the noodles while it boils, top with some toasted seaweed wrap."

ramen,3d6k5k,bob1190,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:02:04 2015 UTC,"Yea the only way to dilute the spice is to dilute the broth, water or stock added.   I would recommend taking a portion out for the child and just more that one bowl weaker."

ramen,3d2hj3,rjksn,3,Mon Jul 13 13:46:48 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm very much a ""Ramen Novice"" as well, so I wouldn't hold my opinion in too high regard, but it seems like the regular Shin is pretty well regarded in these parts, and you could probably consider it the ""better"" kind. I've never had the microwave bowl version, always the stovetop package version (the most common one, which is available at most wallmarts I think), so I can't comment on the bowl specifically."

Think halfway between like a napa cabbage (what they make kimchi out of) and a very mild fresh spinach flavor. I marinate in a little bit of rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil. Then toss in a hot pan! So yummy!"

ramen,3cupp3,spykid,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:03:59 2015 UTC,It was mighty delicious! I ran out of ramen ( the one I made my self and the instant ones) so I had to use the soba noodles to eat/drink the remaining broth with. I don't want to waste that broth which took me 24 hrs to make. The chicharones made it more like Shio-Tonkotsu.
ramen,3cupp3,seablizz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:23:31 2015 UTC,The chicharones made it more like Shio-Tonkotsu.   How so?  Was the tonkotsu base not already salty?
ramen,3cupp3,corntorteeya,2,Fri Jul 10 23:43:56 2015 UTC,I did not use any salt in my base.
ramen,3cupp3,corntorteeya,4,Sat Jul 11 01:50:59 2015 UTC,Pork bones don't really provide the saltiness. The tare does. Maybe he didn't use a salty tare.
ramen,3cupp3,Szolkir,3,Sat Jul 11 00:53:58 2015 UTC,"I did not use salt in my base, I made my tare from reducing a mixture of soy sauce, garlic, ginger, pork fat, and shiitake water. But that was out as well since I made way more broth. So, chicharones it is."
ramen,3cupp3,swimwithefishes,2,Sat Jul 11 01:50:40 2015 UTC,This comes from having made my own broth as well.

ramen,3cs4pu,ManyWhelps,7,Fri Jul 10 09:31:22 2015 UTC,"Paging /u/dillpunk, thoughts on the matter? He's the one who posted that great guide.  Personally I wouldn't use lamb, since that will be undeniably rich and the flavor might overwhelm the chicken. Consider something like a chicken chashu, like this fun but probably challenging recipe:  http://norecipes.com/recipe/chicken-chashu-recipe/  Conversely, you can take chicken breast and slowly poach them in soy sauce/mirin/sake whatever until 155 internal. I've done this in the past and really liked it."
ramen,3cs4pu,Ramen_Lord,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:37:55 2015 UTC,"General consensus is that lamb is a no-no! I will happily attempt this chicken substitute, thank you for your help and the recipe link"
ramen,3cs4pu,cspec,4,Fri Jul 10 19:52:32 2015 UTC,Chicken ramen is very popular in Japan and is very delicious! Never heard of lamb ramen before though.
ramen,3cs4pu,dillpunk,3,Fri Jul 10 16:02:33 2015 UTC,"I'm here!  I posted this recipe as a clone of the wonderful Tenkaippin ramen from Kyoto prefecture in Japan.  They are a chain and can be found pretty much everywhere in Japan now, which is convenient for someone who loves it.    I would avoid using lamb as the meat.  The actual shop typically serves the ramen without the fatty pork belly charsiu that I used, instead opting for leaner roast loin as seen in this photo of the extra pork ramen they serve: http://matomater.com/app/webroot/media/transfer/img/523108af76815.jpg  I would strongly recommend doing something with chicken as the protein as this will mesh with the ramen much better than the lamb.  My suggestion would be to find the biggest, juiciest looking thighs you can find and make your char siu with them.  You can even roll and tie them while braising as you would with traditional pork belly char siu. You can follow the original recipe in this manner substituting the chicken for pork belly when making your tare the day before.    Remember that this ramen is supposed to be THICK.  I took my friends from the US a few weeks ago and they compared it to gravy.  Good luck, don't be afraid to make changes to the recipe and enjoy!"

So i've always been around Japanese food and homemade Cuban. I've gotten very good at cooking Cuban, but ramen is my favorite. I'm fascinated by the variations of food culture as people migrated and mixed through out the world.  This was my first attempt at making a Cuban ramen. I made picadillo, a ground beef dish with a bunch of garlic, onions, green peppers, tomato sauce, olives and chopped up raisins that mix into the stew. I thought it was slightly reminiscent of mabo tofu. For the stock, I slow cooked a bunch of chicken and pork bones i've been saving for a couple of months.  It turned out ok, nothing I want to serve to people yet. The flavors clashed and the tomato ended up making it taste a little bit like pho.   The next time i'll skip the broth and get thicker noodles, making it a tsukemen style. I might replace a good amount of the tomato sauce with miso as well. Ginger and some dashi might make an appearance too.   TLDR: made a Cuban ramen mashup. it went OK."

ramen,3ceqes,ShakoWasAngry,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:49:04 2015 UTC,Thank you for posting this! I live in the suburbs of NYC and I have not yet ventured into sampling ramen there widely (just one little place I popped into on impulse--can't remember the name). I fell in love with gourmet ramen in San Francisco and now I want to explore more possibilities here on this coast.

ramen,3cgd8k,toastytico,5,Tue Jul 7 18:23:46 2015 UTC,"Here are my thoughts on LA ramen compiled from my near weekly ramen excursions:  Best Overall: Tsujita Annex / LA - Sawtell   Tsujita Annex: Thick noodles (and I mean THICK) in one of the tastiest and richest tonkotsu broth your taste buds ever tasted.  Available in Ramen and Tuskemen formats.  Be prepared to wait as the small space can get very crowded during peak hours. Tsujita LA: Located across the street, smaller portions, very thin fine noodles.  Broth has a fish sauce tare at this location, while different is quite delicious.  Also available in Tuskemen with thick noodles.   Runner up: Daikokuya - Downtown / Sawtell   OG LA ramen shop, large portions, thick broth.  Noodles leave a bit to be desired if you are a fan of thicker noodles.  Great gyoza.   Honorable Mentions:   Ramen Champ (Chinatown):  Modern Ingredient driven ramen.  Occupies a much different category than more traditional places like tsujita and daikokuya.  Kind of a has an ivan ramen like feel to it.  Should be avoided if you are seeking out traditional ramen.  Get the chicken shio.  As much as I love tonkotsu, I am very appreciative that this one place is willing to break the mold and serve something other than tonkotsu.  If you end up going over here and you find that this is not your forte, fear not, as there is chego! and pok pok are close by to satisfy any cravings for asian food you may have. Margume Monzo (Downtown): Not ramen, but Udon.  Noodle lovers agree, if you are looking for some fantastically thick noodles head here.  For not being a ramen shop, this place gives just about every other shop a run for their money.  Great Tempura.   Places to avoid:   Men Oh (Downtown): Just say no.  Nothing is real there, don't be fooled. Shin Sen Gumi (Downtown/Sawtwell/San Gabriel valley): If you like to customize your ramen with slightly mediocre topping sure, but if you are looking for authentic ramen you won't be impressed.   Notes:   There are also supposed to be quite a few good places that may be closer to pasadena.  There are supposed to be some good shops in Monterey park, san Gabriel valley, Alhambra ect. If you are really looking for an adventure get yourself out to torrance. If you are fan of chicken based ramen PM me.  Got a real hot tip for that one.   TL;DR: Get yourself to Tsujita Annex ASAP"

I think I've had almost every ramen on the menu and have had no complaints."
ramen,3cdh8e,Silveas,2,Tue Jul 7 01:38:31 2015 UTC,Go for it. No need to trim off the meat.
ramen,3cdh8e,Ramen_Lord,2,Tue Jul 7 03:33:34 2015 UTC,"Is the fatback enough to make a good tonkotsu base?  I also have some dashi stock that I have in the freezer... Would defrosting it and adding shoyu to make it a tare to go with the broth be okay?  Edit: also, thank you for responding!! I wasnt expecting a response from the person whose recipe I looked up and am currently following!!  All Hail Ramen_Lord  https://m.reddit.com/r/ramen/comments/2l2eas/here_it_is_the_granddaddy_of_them_all_homemade_18/"
ramen,3cdh8e,Ramen_Lord,2,Tue Jul 7 04:50:21 2015 UTC,"Take a deep breath. Your Tonkotsu should definitely be fine with that much fatback. I might have even overestimated the amount you need for a Tonkotsu (I use 10% the weight of the bones but you probably don't have to go that high, there's a limit to how much fat you can actually emulsify and the residual just ends up floating on top).   The fatback is in my opinion optional, though it will help you get to that level of richness you crave.  For the dashi... It depends on what you're going for. If you want seafood flavored soup, feel free to add it. Otherwise skip it.   If this is your first time making tonkotsu? Skip the dashi. Focus on the method first, understand the signs in the process, and then you can experiment. This takes experience unfortunately. There will be mistakes made. Try to learn, see what works for you and what doesn't, and attempt again.  But I wouldn't over complicate it, you'll have trouble diagnosing issues in the future.   Tonkotsu, at its core, is really simple. It just involves some correct ingredients and interesting technique, and time. There aren't a lot of rules otherwise."

I mention it only because if you are on your way to a business meeting or something where you need to be lucid then you might want to plan for an extra hour to just digest.
ramen,3cazrw,gimic26,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:38:51 2015 UTC,Ha! Luckily not on a business trip this time around. I'll probably make an hour-ish long stop at The Getty. That should help all the yumminess settle down.

ramen,3cazrw,DrunkasaurusRekts,2,Mon Jul 6 16:16:21 2015 UTC,I've heard that the tsukemen ramen at Tsujita is fantastic. They add a bit of yuzu to the broth. My friend said it was nearly as good as the tsukemen ramen we got at Fuunji in Japan.

The restaurant can do everything they can to keep the place clean, but if they have connected neighbors that have infestations it is going to make its way to the restaurant.

Vodka doesn't impart much flavour to the ginger, and the ginger only loses a bit of flavour to the alcohol.  Then, you have fresh peeled ginger whenever you need it, and ginger infused vodka for cocktail experiments!  I keep fresh horseradish this way too, although I make sure to label the jars so I don't mix up the ginger and the horseradish!"

But I have never mixed bones before, interesting.  I actually finally through out some meat bones because there were in my freezer for a year and I just don't have many recipes calling for a beef stock.    Concerning the 24 hour cook time, a couple of questions.  1) You add more water as you go along or  do you just let it reduce?  2) I generally let my stocks go 4-6 hours max because I have been taught to focus on a clear stock also.  Do you think your stock is cloudy do to the time or another reason?  I have been told too high of a boil causes a cloudy stock.  Again, congrats..."

The only time I've seen it mentioned in any form of media was in an editorial food piece in the Daily Inquirer from around that time.  The bowls were a bit bigger than the Wei Wei bowls and I'm talking about cubes of meat and sauce around 3/4 to an inch thick with lots of sauce included to serve as part of the soup base.

ramen,3c4i7c,corntorteeya,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:23:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the recipe! But like all recipes for chashu I've seen so far, it starts with a large hunk of pork belly as a roast.  Here's what I have to work with.  Have you ever tried to make chashu with that?"
ramen,3c4i7c,corntorteeya,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:37:20 2015 UTC,I'd say try it anyway. Just use less indredients and cook time.
ramen,3c1rg3,e1337ist,7,Fri Jul 3 23:30:29 2015 UTC,"Here's my opinion Portland area Tonkotsu ramen:  Yuzu (Beaverton): This is my favorite. I've only been there twice but their food is very good and very authentic. Great broth and chashu pork.   Boxer Ramen: I've been here the most. They're broth is pretty good, but tends to fluctuate in quality a little bit. Some times it super creamy, some times less so. But it's easy to get to and reliably good.   Biwa: I've been here only once and I don't remember much about it. Based on that I'm going to say it's unremarkable compared to the others. It has a lot of hype though, and I know lots of other people like it so don't take my word on it.  Kukai Ramen(very nearly Beaverton): A newcomer to Oregon. They have more locations in Japan than the US by more than double, which seems like a good sign to me. Their broth is very good. I'd say it's close to Yuzu. But it's been a while since I've been to Yuzu's.   Neko Ramen: They don't have tonkotsu ramen, but their chashu pork was the best I'd had in a while so they get an honorable mention."
ramen,3c1rg3,Slep,2,Sat Jul 4 03:47:50 2015 UTC,"I've been to all those places but Neko (which is a spin off from Biwa) and we share the same opinions. Biwa was unremarkable.

ramen,3btwag,Echomatrix,20,Thu Jul 2 03:02:02 2015 UTC,"So I used James May's style of Carbonara, which is the Italian bacon and eggs, except I used ramen instead of pasta. It took about 15 minutes and didn't require any special cooking tools. His video explains all of it, but I'll explain what I did though:   First, as you do with pasta, I cooked the ramen and added a bit of the chicken spice. If I didn't, the final result is to bland, so a bit of MSG solves the problem Once fully cooked, I strained it and cleaned the pot for bacon. I didn't put any oil because of how much grease the bacon produces.  I let the bacon simmer in the pot for a few minutes, just enough to get it crispy, not burned. I reused the pot because I like to coat the noodles in the bacon grease, and the pot is good mixing area. But if you want to preserve your health, than you can mop it up I then threw in the noodles with the bacon and stirred well so I can coat all the noodles in the grease. I kept it on low heat, which is not enough to cook the bacon, but enough to warm the noodles. After all the noodles are coated, I turned off the burner. Properly made carbonara requires runny, creamy eggs, not scrambled. By turning off the burner, this impeded the cooking process. After one whisked egg is poured in, stir the noodles vigorously in order to coat all the noodles in the egg.  After that, put some pepper in it, cheese, and bam. Ramen a la carbonara."

ramen,3belxq,Ramen_Lord,9,Sun Jun 28 14:45:23 2015 UTC,"Hi everyone!  I’ve tinkering with the idea of a tonkotsu seafood (tonkotsu gyokai) blend for sometime now. I was initially introduced to this method by places like Ramen Yoshi and Men-Eji,  both in Sapporo. These guys crushed it with a dense, rich soup made of pork bones and dried fish products.   But the main reason I wanted to try this, was because they LOOKED gorgeous. They had these big swaths of frothy caps floating on top, as if the bowl was like a cappucino; its dark, mysterious broth hidden beneath a delighful, fatty, fishy foam. It was like ramen tsukemen.  I wanted this.  When I first tried, the effect wasn’t quite there yet. It was too thin. The stock needed to be more intense! And it needed to be darker!  Then I stumbled across a recipe by Tomita in one of my ramen books. Tomita is a wildly successful tsukemen and ramen shop, with a focus on extremely high quality homemade noodles and tonkotsu/fish. They laid it out all on the line: they told their process, their ingredients, their method overall. And they add this froth to their bowl as well, calling them “fat bubbles.” They add it just at the last second, and it sits there, perched, beautiful, waiting to be consumed.  So with their technique as the jumping point, I’d like to share a bowl heavily inspired by theirs. This Tonkotsu Gyokai deviates slightly from their recipe, either due to problems getting ingredients, or timing, or my own knowledge on technique and what I enjoy, but it’s quite enjoyable if you like the big, bold, fishy and pork combo of this style.  This recipe isn’t for everyone. Half of the people I served it to loved it. Half of them hated it. It’s very intense. It’s rich. It’s fishy. But if that’s what you’re looking for, I think you’ll be very satisfied.   And note, you can absolutely use this recipe for tsukemen. I haven’t developed a really great noodle for tsukemen, but the broth, reduced by about one third, is exceptionally rich and works really well as a tsukemen base.   Let’s begin:  Soup  This soup contains a blend of pig femurs, trotters, and chicken feet. A lot of feet. To give the gelatin you crave, and to give the broth enough viscosity that the bubble retain their shape for the visual. We still help them in the bubble formation (a number of shops use a blender for this function, and Tomita actually reserves the bubbles on the side once made), but the gelatin helps them retain their shape.  Makes 10 bowls of ramen.   Ingredients:   8 lbs pork femurs, cut to expose the marrow within 2 pork trotters Optional (.5 lbs backfat) 3 lbs chicken feet, toes and blemishes removed 2 onions, halved One head of garlic, cut in half to expose bulbs One three inch piece of ginger peeled Two carrots, ends removed 1.5 cups niboshi 2 cups lightly packed bonito.   Steps:   Soak the pork bones and trotters overnight in water for lighter color. Not necessary in this application. The morning of (around 12 hours before service), blanch the pork bones and trotters in boiling water, until scum has mostly stopped rising, around 15-30 minutes. Dump the blanching liquid, and scrub the bones and pot of any excess black material.  Add the bones and trotters back to a large stock pot with fresh water, covering them completely. Bring to a boil, cover, and cook at high boil for 4-5 hours. Be sure to add additional water as needed to keep things submerged After the 5 hours, add your chicken feet. Continue to cook, covered, at high boil for 3 more hours.  Add your aromatics, cooking at high boil for 4 hours. This is going to make the color turn slightly darker. That’s ok! We want this! Towards the last hour, be sure to stir often.  After this 12 hours, cut the heat. Add in your bonito and niboshi, allowing to steep for one hour, ideally below 198 degrees.  Strain solids, reserve broth until needed.    Tare  This tare has some noticeable deviations from my tonkotsu method: the soaking liquid is all soy, and I have added some sweetness in the form of more mirin and brown sugar to help balance the dish overall. It adds some interesting molassasy notes that boost the soy and fish flavor, without being overly sweet.   Ingredients:   12 grams kombu 2 cups regular soy sauce (I used a blend of sauces, but good ol kikkoman will work here) ¾ cup niboshi 1 tbsp sesame oil 1 cup loosely packed bonito ¼ cup sake ¼ cup mirin 2 tbs brown sugar   Steps:   The night before (at least 6 hours before), combine the kombu and soy sauce in a container, allow to steep in the refrigerator for a minimum of 3 hours, but overnight is better. Heat a sauce pan on high heat, and add the sesame oil. When just starting to smoke, add the niboshi and stir fry for around 40 seconds to a minute, or until the fish begin to look just slightly browned. Add the kombu and steeped soy to the pot, bring to 176 degrees.  At 176 degrees, discard the kombu. Add the bonito, and steep at this temperature for 10 minutes. Strain, reserve liquid until on the side. In the now empty pot, add your sake, mirin, and brown sugar. Cook on medium heat for 10 minutes, boiling, until the smell of alcohol subsides.  Combine with the liquid from step 6. Tare is complete. If you feel this isn’t salty enough, boil down the tare for a few minutes or add salt. It should be very aggressively salty. Taste with the broth and see how things work.    Noodles  To align with the bold, punchy flavor of this dish, I wanted to increase everything. Lots of chew, lots of alkalinity. The method is the same as other recipes, merely the ratios have changed slightly.   For one portion (measure by weight!):    98g King Arthur bread flour (12.7% protein by weight) 2 g vital wheat gluten (aprox 77.5% protein by weight)  45 g water 1 g salt 2 g baked soda (more info on baked soda here)   Steps:   Add baked soda and salt to the water, dissolve completely. I like to add one at a time, it seems like the baked soda dissolves better if added prior to the salt. In the food processor, add your wheat gluten and flour. Pulse a few times to combine the two.  While running the food processor, add your water mixture slowly, in an even stream. Occasionally, stop to scrape the sides down. You know you're set when you have tiny grain like pieces. Cover the food processor and let this rest for 30 minutes. This gives the flour granules time to fully absorb the water and alkaline salts. Knead it. Currently I use an electric pasta machine to sheet the dough, going through the largest setting, then the 2nd, then the 3rd, then folding and repassing through the largest setting. I repass two to three times, or until I notice the dough is making the machine work really hard. I also like to fold the dough the same direction each time. Some articles I read suggested this kept the gluten strands running in the same direction, which promotes better texture. You'll notice interesting horizontal lines running along the length of your dough if you do it right. If this isn’t an option for you, I used to throw the mix into a plastic bag and step on it repeatedly, which simulates the kneading process used in an industrial setting. When smooth, cover with plastic, and rest at room temp for an hour. This gives the gluten time to relax, and “ripens” the dough according to Japanese cooks.  Pull out your dough. Portion into workable sizes (around one serving's worth), and roll out to desired thickness, using potato starch as you go to prevent sticking. Do this with a pasta machine, it is borderline impossible without a machine. An electric one will save you an incredible amount of effort. Cut your noodles to your desired thickness. Store in tupperware in the fridge until ready to serve. These noodles are helped with a resting phase in the fridge of about a day or so. So in this application, making in advance helps!   Toppings:  This bowl is topped with green onion, some finely diced white onion, chashu, menma, fish powder, nori, and egg. There is one topping worth noting that most other recipes don’t have, and that’d be fish powder. In this application it’s a pretty important part of the dish, so I’d highly recommend using it. The method for this is simple.   Take a cup of packed bonito flake, and spread out on a baking sheet. Toast in a 450 degree oven for 3 minutes, or until brittle. Blitz in a spice grinder. Reserve until needed.   Assembly  Since this bowl is somewhat different from other applications, I thought I’d go into this part a bit. One note, if you want the bubbles to be brown instead of white, you’ll need to add the tare before you begin blending things up.    In the bottom of the bowl, add your tare (around 10% the volume of your soup is a good starting point, so if you have 300 ml of soup, add 30 ml of tare). Add your noodles to water to cook.  Blend up your soup with a handblender or in a blender. This technique froths up the dish, adding the characteristic bubbles.  Pour gently into the tare filled bowls, careful to not be so rigid as to pop them. You’ll be adding more later  Add your noodles to the broth filled bowl. Take some of the residual foam and gently lay it over the noodles. This helps keep the “cap” effect Top with your favorites, serve immediately.    LAST THING   Finally, this broth does work well with tsukemen. For that application, add your broth and tare to a small saucepan, and reduce by around 1/3rd, or to your textural liking. Then add to a bowl. Currently, I don’t have a noodle recipe fit for tsukemen (the above is a little too intensely alkaline here, something I didn’t expect), but if you can find noodles, this works quite nicely.   Feel free to ask questions! I'm sure I left something off."
ramen,3belxq,hotelbravoactual,2,Sun Jun 28 14:51:24 2015 UTC,"Sir, thank you for showing me how to do these things. Do you work in this field? Food carts are really popular here in Portland Oregon, and some other U.S. cities. However, Japanese food is sorely under-served in that capacity.  Have you considered creating a food cart business?"
ramen,3belxq,dillpunk,5,Sun Jun 28 16:58:22 2015 UTC,"Not a cook, just a home cook obsessed with ramen.   The most I've thought about ever selling ramen in the past year has been a pop up of sorts, something like a popup in my dinky apartment, haha. Truth is, I'm not really in this to make money. I just love ramen and want to share that with people in the US.  Food trucks/carts with ramen are somewhat challenging. The cart culture in America means the food needs to be relatively easy to eat standing or walking, and it needs to transport well. Ramen is neither of these things. The carts in Japan always have seating room. Ultimately it seems like a huge cultural difference that does not translate well for the American palate unfortunately."
ramen,3belxq,ramen_minion,2,Sun Jun 28 20:01:16 2015 UTC,Very nice as always. I will try this recipe soon as I always enjoy some deviation from the standard tonkotsu that is so popular here in the USA right now.   Ever been to a little town in Nara called Tenri?  They are famous for a place called saika ramen that makes a murderously good stamina style ramen. http://www.saikaramen.com/.  I'm thinking to do something similar soon.   Any good recipes for a Wakayama style ramen or a tokushima style ramen?  I was in Japan last week and had some nice bowls in the areas I used to frequent.
ramen,3belxq,ramen_minion,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:26:51 2015 UTC,"Hey! I took a bit of inspiration from your Tenkaippin post a long time ago in putting this together. Been trying to chase that ""kotteri"" idea for awhile. You could see the above as sort of a homage to that.   I have not much experience with ramen outside of Sapporo. So miso is really my wheelhouse and the style I know the most about. Other styles of course exist in Sapporo, but really, Miso is king. So those techniques that I learned are really the starting point I have.   That being said, I've definitely heard of tokushima style ramen (that's the one with the raw egg right?). I'm not sure about things like tare and such!   I'll be honest with you, I get comments all the time from people saying ""I can't find this ingredient"" or ""I don't know what ingredient to get!."" That's a pressure I don't want to make home cooks feel. Ramen is first and foremost delicious, and not rigid at all, so lately, I've been focusing on ways to make ramen with easy to find ingredients in the US. The ultimate goal is to make something sort of ""western,"" but with a solid nod to the Japanese sensibility. So while I love hyper-regional ramen, we just live in a country where those ingredients are so hard for people to find. What is a hyper regional ramen for America? For where I live in Chicago? Is that something that's even possible? Does Ramen need Japanese ingredients to exist?  Sort of an interesting challenge. But I have some ideas."
ramen,3belxq,ramen_minion,2,Sun Jun 28 20:11:30 2015 UTC,"Very cool.  Drying out the katsuoboshi in the oven is an interesting step. What about adding niboshi to the fish powder? Too much?   Noodles look fantastic, as always."
ramen,3bgujd,BobLordOfTheCows,7,Mon Jun 29 02:42:32 2015 UTC,"It would seem prudent to develop your own recipe first and then simply look for a ""chef"" you can teach the recipe. Knowing how to do it right means you can control the quality as well as teach the next chef when the one you hire quits. If this business venture is serious and you want to do it right, it would be a small expense to take a trip to Japan and go on a ramen tour to see what the people in the ""homeland"" do.  I'd suggest starting with a Tonkotsu ramen for its richness and depth. You can always start with a basic recipe and then tweak it to make it yours.  http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/how-to-make-perfect-tonkotsu-ramen-food-lab-redux.html"

ramen,3bgujd,Ramen_Lord,2,Mon Jun 29 17:57:23 2015 UTC,Completed the planning process None to speak of
ramen,3bgujd,Ramen_Lord,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:38:51 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  Now, apart from being a ramen nerd, in my day-job, I work as a marketer and consultant, so I like to think I have some business savvy. Still, I am not an entrepreneur - my clients are all blue chip, working with established markets and products -  so the context of my work is definitely different. Take what I say with a grain of salt.   That being said, I'm gonna call it how I see it. Call it unsolicited advice.   Short answer: Just post on places like Craigslist, indeed.com, and your local classifieds. Advertise the openning, people who are interested will contact you if it seems legitimate, you have a website, cash, etc.   Longer answer:   I'm assuming, by being done with the planning, that you're saying you have a full business plan. This is a little confusing, since without a product, your business plan is essentially incomplete. The product drives the rest of the business, advertising and branding will only get you so far, and those venues are expensive.  You need a product, so you've decided to take a chef on who will help you design this. Totally admirable thing to do, actually a smart one really.   However, I have some issues with the plan currently. I think you need to take a good look at the perspective of the potential chef you hire before proceeding. What is the upside for the chef? Consider that in a lot of ways, your business not only doesn't exist, but even if it does, it becomes essentially worthless without a chef doing product development for you.   Chefs, like most people in the labor force, will take on a job for at least one of the two reasons below:   The pay is awesome The prestige is awesome   In your business, reason one is probably a no go. You have no cash flow. You won't until you open. Unless you have some investors, you're going to be operating at a loss prior to launch. So convincing a person to become your chef is challenging here; how do they even know you'll have a job for them in 4 months time? 70% of restaurants fail in the first 5 years, and you haven't even opened the doors yet.   For reason two, you also can't really offer much of that with the job itself. Chefs want a pedigree, it's like classic resume building. That's why people work at places like Alinea or French Laundry for $24,000 a year. It builds their skillset and marketability.   Unfortunately, you have no restaurant experience, so your chances of landing a high quality chef with the promise of greatness are minimal. What prestige will they gain from you if you hire them? They design your menu and then what? Get fired? Get no recognition?  So you have to offer something that gives one of those two. The easiest way in my opinion to do this is to partner with a chef, rather than just hire one. Give the chef some equity in the company.  Not necessarily the majority (you're fronting the capital and it's ultimately your vision, so majority share is fine). A partnership provides the following that your current arrangement does not have:   Skin the game. The chef now has a reason to stick around. Profit from the business goes into their pocket. They want this to succeed. This gives the promise of future profitability.    Ownership of the process. If the restaurant does well, the chef can honestly say it's their work that helped this. It helps with their branding. It also helps with branding the restaurant; you don't just have a manager wallowing in the background, you have a highly involved chef.    Find a chef who wants to open a ramen shop. As corny as this sounds, craigslist, indeed.com, and classified ads will help you find prospects. Say you have the capital to do it, and you'd like to partner with them. Easy if you can find a quality person who wants to finally ""own"" a restaurant.    Now... this is all contingent on you having the capital to open a restaurant. Honestly, this is sort of critical, because without the capital, you essentially bring nothing to the table. So all of the above is dependent on that. Given that you've said you're opening in two months, I assume you have capital to fund this opening, be it investors, family, loans, whatever. If not, seriously, that should be the first thing you do."

ramen,3bgujd,Manpuddo,2,Tue Jun 30 05:54:55 2015 UTC,"You are really looking for a consultant not a chef. Nobody will really take on this much work for little money and then want to walk away. I would try ally with a high quality ramen place in a town where your sphere of influence doesn't overlap. This way you can have a chef/owner wanting to branch out and will come in to correct things over time. You then can share the name of the chef on the restaurant.  You would also get someone who has actually done the ordering, sourcing and such. You always have to pay for this experience once.   You should also be working in a ramen place right now.   Like ramen lord I would recommend having the person come in with say a 10% stake in the restaurant.   While 3 months can train a staff the hard part is going to be be turn over. You have to constantly train restaurant staff and need the qua  I would look to the current ramen places that you like in the area.

ramen,3bgujd,goldfool,2,Mon Jun 29 07:47:03 2015 UTC,"I practiced a lot, tweaked things, experimented with ingredients to strike a good balance between price per serving and quality/integrity of the dish, create a survey, hold tastings, ask people to take the survey.  And for me, as a non-japanese person making a japanese dish, I insisted on having Japanese people taste it and give their honest opinion on it, which was not only flattering, but also insightful and gave me lots of ideas for improvement, increased efficiency, etc."
ramen,3bgujd,goldfool,2,Mon Jun 29 08:44:15 2015 UTC,"Well, your palate is your guide. You know what good ramen taste like.    Choose a broth, pork neck bone, chicken feet, beef bones. Either simmer on low for overnight, or keep it on rapid boil for a few hours. Simmer overnight will give you a clear broth, rapid boil will give you tonkotsu broth.   Add the aromatics while it simmers/boils. Japanese aromatics for ramen appears to be onion, ginger, garlic, daikon radish etc.   Then take the tare and experiment. tare is usually salt, soy sauce, miso and combination thereof.   You need some meat to top with. Chinese charsiu is popular, but really anything fatty and meaty works. Braised pork belly in soy ginger, garlic sauce and crisped up works.   Then you need soft boiled eggs. This is easier than people think. Take the fridge temp egg and gently put into boiling water and cook for 5 minutes. And then cool under running water.   Then you need some garnishes like green onions and shaved nori.   Noodles are important, but you can get away with yakisoba noodles from megamarts.   You'll be surprised at the quality ramen you can make with just the stuff up there."

ramen,3b05uc,KrakatauGreen,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:14:30 2015 UTC,It has ramen noodles as well which are not visible in the pic but are at the bottom of the bowl. I was running short of them so had to put some udon in too :P
ramen,3b05uc,immature_eejit,3,Thu Jun 25 15:51:54 2015 UTC,Looks fantastic! Any chance of a recipe or ingredient list?
ramen,3b05uc,anonb1234,6,Wed Jun 24 23:14:55 2015 UTC,"Here is a pic of the veges I used for the broth and the toppings : http://imgur.com/nH8xQ4c  The recipe: (I improvised on a recipe from youtube I think)  For the broth: 2 thick slices of Daikon. 1 onion with skin on. 3 cloves of garlic. 2 green onions (scallions) with roots on (washed). 1 celery stick. 1 small piece of ginger. 2 dried shitake mushrooms. soy sauce (2-3 table spoons) vinegar (3 teaspoons) sugar (1 teaspoon)  I boiled about 2-2.5 liters of water with all the above ingredients thrown in. Just added the sugar, soy sauce, and vinegar once the liquid was boiling and let the broth kinda keep simmering for about 1 hour.  For the garnishes : some Julienned carrot 3 small mushrooms some sugarsnaps some baby scallions a red pepper 3 baby corn some flowering broccoli a piece of courgette  I just quickly stir fried all these veges I had after thinly cutting them down.   To assemble:  I Added the ramen+soba noodles to the hot broth for 4-5 minutes while on the gas (until the noodles were done). Put the noodles in a  bowl and poured in the broth and arranged the toppings with pepper on top and threw in some toasted sesame seeds."
ramen,3b05uc,immature_eejit,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:05:43 2015 UTC,I can't see any ramen or soba noodles - just udon.    Looks alright though.    Vegan ramen seems like an oxymoron to me.
ramen,3b05uc,LerithXanatos,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:00:37 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'm going to try to talk myself into making this ASAP!
ramen,3b05uc,LerithXanatos,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:42:31 2015 UTC,I tried out your recipe with kombu added. The stock came out with a very strong shiitake taste. Is it because I simmered too long?
ramen,3b05uc,Bellpiece,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:31:08 2015 UTC,Most probably that is the case. You could try adding the shiitake later or just using the kombu for that umami flavor and just using rehydrated/fresh shiitake instead of putting the shiitake in the broth.
ramen,3b05uc,untbunny,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:45:20 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for the advice. I actually used fresh shiitake for a Korean jjigae and I couldn't taste the shiitake at all. I'll probably add the shiitake halfway into simmering since I'm not a fan of of mushroom anyways."
ramen,3b05uc,jamjopeanut,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:03:43 2015 UTC,"Ah, yea I used to not like mushrooms before, sort of grew into the taste. I now kinda love them all mostly. I know what you mean , I had this bowl of ramen at Bonedaddies in london and the mushroom flavor was kinda too much for me to take."

ramen,3aqg9k,I_LICK_PUPPIES,5,Mon Jun 22 17:54:42 2015 UTC,"The fresher the eggs are, the more difficult they are to peel. Don't use the ones that have just come shooting out of the chicken. If they've been sitting around in your fridge for a week or so, boil them up and they should be relatively easy to peel."
ramen,3aqg9k,pupfish,4,Mon Jun 22 21:58:17 2015 UTC,"Yes.  You're in luck, it's super easy if you forget all the silly shit.   Bring pot of water to a full rolling boil more water rather than less Take eggs directly from fridge and gently put them in the boiling water. While they're boiling, prepare a bowl of ice water. Let boil for either 6 or 7 minutes, lid on, depending on exactly what you mean by ""soft.""  I go for 6.      When the timer beeps, immediately remove the eggs from the boiling water and put them in the ice water for 3-5 minutes. Remove from ice water and tap the top and bottom of the eggs on the counter.  You should then be able to roll it on the counter with the palm of your hand to break the entire shell.  If it doesn't come off very easily at this point, which it should, run it under cold water while peeling from the top down. Enjoy.     ALTERNATE:   Steam the eggs for 7 minutes on top of boiling ramen or rice with a lid on the pot.   The key with any method is consistency.  If you use more water and a lid, there will be more thermal energy available to quickly heat the eggs, which will prevent fluctuation in the cook time.  If you put it in an ice water bath, the egg inside the shell will shrink and pull away from the shell itself and it will be cool enough to handle more quickly without the inside of the egg cooling off much at all, so you can still eat it with hot food.  If you plan to store the eggs for later use, hard or soft boiled, the ice bath is absolutely mandatory because it prevents the eggs from cooking in the shell from their stored thermal energy.  For storage, ice for at least 10 minutes."

ramen,3aqg9k,plasmamaker,3,Mon Jun 22 23:00:27 2015 UTC,"Crumble the shell (by rolling) and remove a piece, then peel the rest under the tap with cold water running over it. The water loosens the membrane and makes it peel easily.  My mom taught me that as a kid. It usually takes me maybe 20 seconds to peel an egg. I use normal cheap supermarket eggs."

ramen,3amtcn,Blackie_Chann,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:43:59 2015 UTC,"I've made a pretty simple recipe:  Boil water with pepper, garlic powder, cayenne (or really any spices it doesn't matter), add raw egg when boiling immediately followed by noodles, cook until noodles are done. Add sauce packet, (optional), soy sauce, sririacha etc etc and then pour in a bowl and top with green onion. Super simple egg ramen that is to die for IMO."
ramen,3amtcn,aliusmander,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:17:57 2015 UTC,"Personally, what I put on a package of instant noodles is some slices of ham steak, two pieces of boiled egg and a little bunch of vegetable pieces on top (boiled). I also add a bit soy sauce. Of course, this is apart from the flavor package that comes included with the noodles. Hope it helped."

ramen,3amtcn,SanFransicko,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:25:33 2015 UTC,"The most important thing for me is to start with good noodles, I make mine if I have time.  It's surprisingly easy if you've never tried.  Found a pasta roller at Ross for less than $20.  Next I can get a great deal on a 5 lb bag of dried shiitake mushrooms at my local grocery store.  I put almost two handfuls of the mushrooms in a pot with just enough water to cover and boil that for an hour or so to make the basic broth.  Make sure it doesn't boil off, you'll probably have to add to it.  Then it's a combo of Sriracha, low sodium soy, onion/shallot, and that Thai garlic chili sauce mixed to taste.  Toss the noodles in for the end of the boil, drop an egg in right before serving, and anything else that's fresh and seasonal makes it in.  My favorite is technically not traditional, but the local grocery store makes really good kimchi."

There is soooo much good food in Singapore.  Check out ieatishootipost's blog. He has a section on ramen in singapore.  If you can find a supermarket, look for Mykuali white penang curry instant noodles. Those have been voted as the best instant noos in a lot of food blogs.

ramen,3a8haz,kusheee,2,Thu Jun 18 16:00:02 2015 UTC,"I beat two eggs with 1 tsp sugar, 1 tsp mirin, and a half tbsp soy sauce. Then swiped some coconut oil in a nonstick pan that was heated (medium flame) and poured half of the egg mixture, let it cook, then rolled it up. Put a little more oil in (it helps if you soak up the initial oil on a paper towel and use that to re-oil the pan), then the rest of the egg, let that cook (probably needs about 45-60 seconds at that point) and roll the first layer into the second one. Then slice!  I think you'd be fine without the mirin. It was good but I'll probably omit it next time I make this because it was a bit too sweet for me. Chopped spring onions would also be great mixed in."

ramen,3a2e5l,Verivus,4,Tue Jun 16 19:16:09 2015 UTC,"A raw egg into your broth will get mixed in making the broth creamier, but not giving you a cooked egg topping to eat.  If you try to cook it without mixing it's still going to run and probably form egg 'strands' through your soup.  Neither of those are bad outcomes if that's what you want, but if you want an egg topping you'll need to cook the egg first. You can always soft boil or poach the egg first to keep it runny."
ramen,3a2e5l,Slogo,3,Tue Jun 16 18:22:29 2015 UTC,"Exactly. There's no ""right"" way of making ramen."
ramen,3a2e5l,_invoker,2,Tue Jun 16 19:35:52 2015 UTC,"I don't like the water with instant. It tastes...floury. Even when I use the soup powder, I boil water with a kettle. I always dump the floury water.  Hard boiled egg is my usually go to.   Another method is to crack the raw egg on to the freshly cooked noodle and let the remaining heat cook the egg. Like, gyudon. It gives a creamier texture.  I think what you do is like egg flower soup. Boil the water, add the egg and quickly stir it so it becomes strains of egg."
ramen,3a2e5l,afyaff,2,Tue Jun 16 19:19:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, that's what I do. I just beat an egg and dump it in after the instant is done boiling.

ramen,3a2e5l,DinoPilot,2,Tue Jun 16 21:17:21 2015 UTC,After cooking the noodles for 3 mins or so I drop in the egg very carefully and don't touch it. Just put the lid on and cook for 1.5 to 2 mins for semi runny yolk or. 2.5 to 3 for soft boil. I have done this hundreds of times at this point. Looks something like this http://imgur.com/e9LIP3h
ramen,3a2e5l,binarycontrol,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:36:43 2015 UTC,I usually cook the noodles then once they are done I add the egg. Let it get white then stop cooking. You'll get a runny yoke and it'll be awesome.

ramen,3a2e5l,purebishop,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:43:39 2015 UTC,I like to shallow fry an egg in hot oil. The whites get extremely crispy (perfect imo) and then you can cook the yolk however you want - runny to add creamy-ness to the broth or fully cooked for something to eat as well (personally I like it in between).  This is my favourite way to cook eggs.
ramen,3a2e5l,klokwerk_,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:07:42 2015 UTC,"I recommend poaching it, in the ramen broth or in water. You have total control over the doneness of the egg and it has a great silky texture if cooked correctly. Try 4 minutes at 178 F for a deliciously runny yolk."
ramen,3a2e5l,RocketPawnch,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:21:13 2015 UTC,That's what I do. I also add some sriracha to give it a kick. My favorite flavor to do this with is beef
ramen,3a2e5l,j943th6,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:14:09 2015 UTC,I eat a lot of instant ramen and every now and then I throw a raw egg in the water.  I put the dry brick of noodles in and throw it in the microwave for 2 1/2 minutes.  I basically end up with a soft boiled egg.  You may need to experiment because cooking eggs in a microwave can cause them to explode.
ramen,3a2e5l,carbonx,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:03:34 2015 UTC,The whole point is that it is soft boiled....

Though hard boiled isn't not great and soft boiled is wonderful if you ask me... or that medium where the yolk is just barely not liquid but a sort of slow gel. Perfect. And totally different than hard boiled.  Tea eggs are great as well.
ramen,3a2e5l,caveat_cogitor,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:22:33 2015 UTC,"Here is my solution: Sous Vide the egg at 65 C for 45 min or boil water, put extra large eggs from the fridge for 5min then dip them in ice water.

Also such a good deal, $8.95 for the ramen, a bowl of rice, and 3 gyoza.   No joke though you need to get there like 40 minutes before they open. First time I went we arrived about 20 minutes before and there was a huge line. We had to wait about 40 minutes after they opened for a table and were one of the last ones to get ramen. They will sell out fast! This past time I went by myself and got there just before 11:20 (they open at 12) there were already 6 people in line and within a minute there were nearly ten more people behind me.   They have great sushi too!! Really well priced as well. If you can't figure out a day to get the ramen go some night for sushi (granted you like sushi). Bring some friends it's a good time!"

ramen,39z7wu,BlasphemousWords,7,Mon Jun 15 23:57:52 2015 UTC,"So I've struggled with this a lot. I get asked pretty frequently for vegetarian friendly recipes. Specifically vegan recipes too. And I want to help, but there are some hurdles. Namely:  Fat is king in ramen, and animal fat is generally the way to go. Lard is lord. It's hard to replicate that taste!  Gelatin is a beautiful thing in ramen. You want it in substantial amounts, even in light broths, because it gives the characteristic mouthfeel that makes ramen so satisfying. Any stock I've made has gelled at least slightly after chilling. So you need to be able to add body. Hard to do with just vegetables.  A lot of glutamate comes from animal products. Meat, bones, dried fish, all have it.  To summarize, using meat adds fat, umami, and body to your base broth. These are challenges to consider when cooking vegan.  So, FOR ME, if I were to go vegan ramen, I would do a couple things.   I need a base broth with some body. Unsweetened soy milk is a common option here, as the emulsified fat helps give that mouthfeel, and soybeans have some glutamate. Regular vegetable stock would work too, but make sure it uses things like mushrooms, possibly tomato paste, to add more glutamic acid. My tare needs a ton of glutamate. Miso is a great contender, and shoyu would work well too. Shio typically needs fish of various kinds, so it's a harder sell (though I have a recipe that is just chicken and kombu in the works, but still not vegan!). But my miso recipe is essentially vegan. Go for it. The miso and tahini add body and great complexity. Consider also adding tobanjan or black bean sauce to the tare, which are also fermented and have nice glutamic acid. In a pinch, go for MSG. Adding a starchy vegetable purée, like a potato, to help improve body of the stock. This would work better for miso, where cloudy broth is not an issue. But the body will be welcome. Make sure you have an aroma oil of some kind. Look at my recipes in the side bar for information on aroma oil.   Unfortunately, these are all ideas, and not a foolproof recipe. You'll have to try stuff out, see what works, and give it a shot.   Serious eats also did a recipe on vegan ramen, but it's sort of all over the place, feels like it's trying every trick in the book, not focused. But it hits those notes above dead on."
ramen,39z7wu,Ramen_Lord,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:13:23 2015 UTC,A bit of Tomato Paste is a great idea. I've recently started using it for a lot of things as a small tsp can really add some strong umami to a dish without adding any tomato flavor.
ramen,39z7wu,Slogo,3,Tue Jun 16 15:45:46 2015 UTC,"I guess you could make some shiitake-leek-garlic-onion-carrot-celery broth for like 8-12+ hours, then make a sesame-garlic oil and find a veggie shoyu base recipe.  I'm not sure.   Good luck!"
ramen,39z7wu,IMightBePaulasBitch,3,Tue Jun 16 00:16:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was thinking it would be something like that. A base broth of Shiitake, leek, garlic onion celery kombu and mix it with a shoyu base and add chili paste, black garlic oil and toasted sesame."
ramen,39z7wu,ramen_minion,4,Tue Jun 16 00:21:13 2015 UTC,Nakamura at RamenLab used tea as the broth base for his miso ramen. He also used the Momofuku hozon paste as part of the tare.
ramen,39z7wu,Slogo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:27:02 2015 UTC,"I've been recently trying to figure out a good veggie ramen recipes, as I've had delicious veggie ramen before. I didn't really want to 'cheat' with things like soy milk or starchy veggies as I wanted something clearer, yet still delicious. Interestingly one local place admitted to me they just use water + tare + armoa oil for their ramen broth (and probably a little more they aren't telling me :D), but it still came out delicious.  My recent attempts were very mushroom focused. The recipe is quite sloppy and I'm not satisfied with it, but you can see my notes here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aUsIARVHHje_HcmBxpr3xo8_YQ8ujxSkf7-ZLd3yb40 The 176 degree note is probably especially superfluous, but I didn't have a better target temp and I wanted something high enough to cook, but not too high to obliterate the flavor compounds from the mushrooms. (As I mention in the docs it came out watery, but I made the tare in a way that was watery AND I used too much water in the broth making maybe double the servings I should have)  Other than what I mention in the docs I think the tare was wrong for the broth, though I didn't follow the recipe which doesn't help. It needed some brightness to bring to the otherwise very earthy soup and I think miso would have been a good choice. Still I like the mushroom forward recipes and the topping were yummy (mmm mushrooms) so the ramen overall was alright.  The short explanation of what I was trying to do is use ground dried mushrooms as a thickener, something I heard a scant whisper of working elsewhere on the web. I'm not entirely sure it works as a methodology, I need more testing, but I did learn that ground dried mushrooms are delicious in things like pasta red sauce so that's a plus. My other thought, which I couldn't get my hands on, was to try adding a bit of agar agar to the soup to give it that gelatin consistency and body."
ramen,39z7wu,Ramen_Lord,2,Tue Jun 16 15:41:24 2015 UTC,"Very interesting, thanks for sharing that google doc. Took a quick peek, very detailed!  You mentioned some pretty interesting stuff in this comment...   Interestingly one local place admitted to me they just use water + tare + armoa oil for their ramen broth (and probably a little more they aren't telling me :D), but it still came out delicious.   I have seen this before! I can't even imagine how this tastes but a shop recent revealed their tare recipe as part of this technique. It had Umeboshi in it!  It's also interesting you mentioned mushrooms...  One of the ramen shops making some (pun intended) waves lately uses mushrooms in aroma oil, and as a furikake of sorts as a topping. Check em out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCNKfTpKIT8  (The pun is that the shop is themed after a boat, for some reason I can't recall).   Essentially, fresh mushrooms are blitzed in a food processor, fried in oil until crisp and brown, and then reserved to be sprinkled on top. The oil is then used as an aroma oil. I imagine this is quite earthy then, but the idea of layering this flavor throughout the dish is sort of interesting. I don't remember if mushrooms are in the tare, but it makes sense to do so.   Admittedly, the linked video above is a tonkotsu, so it's not what you're looking for in terms of clarity. But this trick has been used to make vegan tonkotsu bowls in Japan for sure.  The only item I could think of to add body naturally and keeping clarity would be something like apple, which has pectin. But how you'd deal with the sweetness is something different entirely. (Some pork stocks have apple in them though, so it's not unheard of).   Definitely an interesting challenge. Curious to see how your future experiments turn out."
ramen,39z7wu,Slogo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:21:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the great feedback! I'm definitely going to keep working on the recipe.  Another thing I had thought of, but couldn't figure out the logistics of, is if you could use the starchy noodle water to give the broth body. It's a pretty common technique in pasta sauces, but I'm not really sure if it would impart the right type of thickening or if it would water down the broth too much."
ramen,39z7wu,Ramen_Lord,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:46:03 2015 UTC,"Ah... interesting...  I personally wouldn't do that (the water is going to have some residual alkalinity in addition to being starchy). So it might taste odd.  Additionally, unlike a pasta sauce, where you'd boil it down and cook the noodles in the sauce, you probably wouldn't have time to cook the broth once the noodles are done; they should be served right away."
ramen,39z7wu,Slogo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:52:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was the logistical part I couldn't figure out, once the noodles are done it's eating time!  The alkalinity is a really good point though, and probably enough to scare me off of trying it and ruining a batch of ramen (for now at least)."
ramen,39vnai,mercfh85,5,Mon Jun 15 04:17:27 2015 UTC,"The best way is to use a circulator in the 67°c-70°c region to prepare actual onsen tamago.  I just do from the fridge into boiling water for 5.45 minutes, then into cold water for a few minutes. I like a runny yolk, for Onsen tamago the yolk should be a bit firmer, more like custard.

ramen,39vnai,wormoil,2,Mon Jun 15 14:35:55 2015 UTC,"I want to jump in with another method of making the onsen egg without a circulator. You can definitely make a reasonable facsimile of one with just a pot and a digital thermometer - I've tried the boil/plunge you talk about here, but I find this way makes for the perfect runny and only slightly thickened yolk.   It's called the ""13 Minute Onsen Egg,"" from a book called Ideas in Food. Just cook the eggs for 13 minutes at 167°F. Indistinguishable from a 'real' sous vide egg, in my opinion!"
ramen,39vnai,Picardtrick,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:41:27 2015 UTC,"I know there's also a similar method described in the Momofuku book, but I have to look it up.  I'm all in for trying the method you mention. Does it need exactly 167°F or is it good enough to fluctuate around that temperature?"
ramen,39vnai,wormoil,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:46:36 2015 UTC,"I use a Thermapen to monitor the temperature. I do ""babysit"" the pot for the entire 13 minutes, and I'll take the pot off the flame or turn it up slightly if the temp is going off course, but it definitely does vary - probably between 160° and 170°. So you do have some wiggle room. I do usually put them in a cold water bath when they come out.   I find I have really great results with this method AND, like a real onsen egg, you can make a batch of them, stash them in the fridge (in the shells), and use them later and they have just about the same great texture as when they're first cooked. Really, I can't differentiate texture-wise between these eggs and ones that are made in $500 sous vide machines."
ramen,39vnai,Picardtrick,3,Mon Jun 15 18:17:09 2015 UTC,"Put entire egg in when water is boiling, before you put in the noodles, and then a couple of minutes later add in the noodles and the other junk. Both are done at the same time. Crack egg in a couple of minutes before ramen is done, depending on how hard you like your yolk, and DO NOT STIR. Crack egg into a bowl, scramble it, pour egg in a minute or two before ramen is done, stir.   I know green onion goes well with most ramen types, if not all of them, and I think maybe some ripped up cabbage may also work... What I usually do is the egg, a bit of green onion, some soy sauce, a little bit of garlic... I'm gonna be trying some of this hot pepper paste (gochujang) I found not too long ago, too, in some creamy chicken ramen. It seems like an obvious choice."
ramen,39vnai,CarolineJohnson,7,Mon Jun 15 16:56:42 2015 UTC,"It depends on how long you want it cooked?  The way I like it is: boil water, crack a couple of eggs in there and stir it to break up the yolk, top with noodles, top with some greens (I like most greens), turn off the stove, put the lid on, wait til the noodles are done, stir it all up.  If I put frozen veg in, I throw it in as soon as the water boils, and then wait for it to boil again, do the egg, do the noodles.  Or, if I have a noodle bowl to microwave, I take the noodles out, crack the egg in the bottom, put the noodles back on top, add the water, microwave.  Lately I've been making Taiwanese stewed soy sauce eggs because I love them - I grew up on them and I could eat a million of them in one sitting LOL.  They can be eaten cold so sometimes I throw it in the ramen after the noodles are done (slicing is optional), sometimes I eat it cold while I cook the ramen.  Oh, and I like to add red pepper flakes while the water is heating up.  Sometimes I omit the seasoning packet and use miso instead.  Edit: I will put any quick cooking or already cooked leftover veg into ramen.  Also, stuff like lettuce (it's all ""greens"" in my book) I also like tofu, so I'll slice it up and add it too.  Any leftover meats - buy a rotisserie chicken!"

Gently roll eggs around / stir water during first 2 min for pretty, symmetric eggs.   put leftover peeled eggs in a Tupperware or mason jar with equal parts soy sauce, water and sake(or Mirin) for delicious Shoyu Tamago which are good up to a week."
ramen,39vnai,Bigelow92,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:26:30 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of options for the egg. - If you want the kind of egg that has a ""gelatinous"" yolk, you want to soft boil the egg. - If you want, you can crack an egg and drizzle it into the boiling noodles, and it will thicken up the broth a bit. - /u/ifoundxaway mentioned soy sauce eggs which are amazing.    For adding extra veggies, that's completely up to what kind of veggies you like, keeping in mind that you'd toss them in boiling water. I really like adding celery and radishes to mine. Keep in mind softer veggies can turn into mush, so just be mindful of that.    If you're not already, give some of the ""premium"" instant noodles a try... Shin Ramyun (and especially Black, if you can find it.) are pretty widely approved of. If you're really lucky to live somewhere that has them, keep your eye out for ""Sun Noodles.""

ramen,39vnai,je-june,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:51:14 2015 UTC,"Not for what to add, but on how to cook - I generally wait for he water to boil, add seasoning and noodles, and i continue to boil for 5-6 minutes and cook a lot of that water away. You need to be attentive so that the noodles don't stick to the pot, but this will make the noodles themselves absorb a lot of flavour. With about 1 min left of cooking, I add an egg or two and mix thoroughly. NOTE: the egg will cook regardless. Even if you put it in and mix around, while it sits for a few minutes before you eat it will cook.   In terms of toppings: Kimchi, raw red onions, garlic can be added at the end. Also chilis. I also sometimes put some cheese on top at the end, korean style."

ramen,39tqer,PoorMansRayRomano,7,Sun Jun 14 18:09:35 2015 UTC,Recipe please
ramen,39tqer,zmoney1213,5,Sun Jun 14 20:32:57 2015 UTC,"Here's the Recipe (and I apologize in advance for the lack of specific measurement--ramen, for me, is still a taste and adjust affair):   The broth was a simple double soup. I made a dashi by soaking kombu overnight, then heating it until almost boiling it. I removed the kombu and added katsuobushi, boiled it for a minute then let it steep for around 7 minutes. The chicken portion of the broth I made by first boiling 3.5 pounds of chicken (backs and wings), skimming off the scum constantly, then letting it simmer with a knob of ginger, a half head of garlic and four green onions. This went on for about 5 hours.   The noodles were three cups of flour, 1.5 tsp of baked baking soda and 3/4 cup of water. Kneaded, rested, kneaded again, put through the pasta roller then cut with the spaghetti attachment.   The tare was soy sauce (a little tamari, but mostly some good usukuchi that I bought from my Japanese grocer) mixed with sake, mirin, a little sugar, the spent kombu and some more katsuobushi. I let it reduce over a low heat until it was thick enough and the salinity was right.   The eggs were 6 minute eggs, peeled and marinated in soy, sake, mirin and some of the dashi.   The chashu was braised in sake, soy, mirin with palm sugar, garlic and ginger. It rested for a half day, was sliced then hit a hot pan before serving.   The menma I was fortunate enough to buy from the Japanese grocer in my city. Same with the nori.  Hope this is of some help to someone."

It consists of a spicy sauce containing preserved vegetables (often including zha cai (榨菜), lower enlarged mustard stems, or ya cai (芽菜), upper mustard stems), chili oil, Sichuan pepper, minced pork, and scallions served over noodles.  Sesame paste and/or peanut butter is sometimes added, and occasionally replaces the spicy sauce, usually in the Taiwanese and American Chinese style of the dish.  In this case, dandanmian is considered as a variation of ma jiang mian (麻醬麵), sesame sauce noodles. In American Chinese cuisine, dandanmian is often sweeter, less spicy, and less soupy than its Sichuan counterpart.

We had originally planned on going to Ramen Nakamura, which is right across the street. We looked at their menu (and the long line), and decided to give Ezogiku a shot instead. GOOD CHOICE.  Seriously delicious food and awesome waiter. The environment is no-frills. Just a counter and some tables, but the FOOOD. Oh my gosh, the food. The yakisoba was delicious, and I enjoyed my gyozu and miso ramen. They offered a few different sauces (sesame oil, sriracha, soy sauce, etc), but honestly the food didn't need it. Definitely worth it to order a combo--- an extra couple of bucks gets you a side of fried rice and dumplings. One meal really would have been big enough to share.  Also, no beer or wine, but the waiter was fine with a bring-your-own-bottle scenario. We ran next door the the ABC and picked up some PBRs to enjoy with our meal, and he even brought us chilled glasses to pour it into.  Great food, excellent service."

You can get them in most Asian markets, and Amazon has 'em too-- (just watch the dates.  Old noodles get all sorts of funky.)  The flagship product, (Mi goreng), is eaten dry, chow mien style-- this means that you completely drain it.  They have many flavors to be had.  Some are soup style, with some liquid left, but my preference is for the classic.  The mi goreng is by far my favorite, followed by the spicy version of the same,  then bbq chicken.  What makes these awesome noodles stand out is that you mix several ""sachets"" of seasonings together first, and also that they contain fried onions which are the tiny superstars of the dish.  I'm not an egg guy, but I'm told if you drop an egg into the hot cooking water shortly before you drain it, that it adds another level of delciosity.  YMMV.  Good luck!"

I can't disagree completely, but I'll try to defend why I think it's way better:  The prompt drain at minute 3 generates noodles that have a great bite-back, as opposed to sitting in broth and continuing to soften.  Also, since instant ramen is generally fried and dried the thin wavy noodles have a much different texture.  The seasonings are tasty and much better than something i could [quickly] whip up.  I can cook, sure, but for instant, these do it for me.  Finally, I personally leave maybe a tablespoon or so of water since I think it helps disperse the seasonings better.

ramen,39bd1e,helloamy,8,Wed Jun 10 21:56:50 2015 UTC,"I like Top Ramen Oriental, because it's more affordable than my preferred Shin Ramyun. I make two packs at once. I rarely include meats, but I'll throw in some frozen veggies before adding noodles and prepare everything together like that. The most recent time I added a dash of Worcestershire and some shrimp in addition to the veggies."

I take 1 to 1.5 of the quarter pound hebrew national beef hotdogs, and slice it up. Fry it on a pan to get a little sear. Add it to the ramen, and then use a lot of crystal's hot sauce. It is frigging amazing, and simple. You can throw in sweet onions, corn or whatever else to that."

I would also recommend having something from the Ramen Jiro chain (or something similar). It's a bowl of ramen piled with bean sprouts, chashu, and pork fat. You'll know you're there when you smell the aroma of pork fat lingering by the doorway. It's open late and also the best thing to eat after a night of drinking.  Happy slurping!"

It's about $3 to get in and it exceeded my expectations! Inside you'll find ramen restaurants that feature ramen from different regions of Japan. Ippudo opened up shop inside recently too. Each bowl is about $9 and served as a regular portion so you'll probably only be able to try one (unless you have multiple stomachs) but it's worth it.   Also, they have a build-your-own ramen booth with real broth, meat, and noodles in vacuum packs and you can take a picture to label the box as your ""own brand"" of noodles. Definitely a must go!"

What we did was find the one that had the longest line, and we ended up trying this ramenya (sorry, I don't know the English name).  I have access to Tsujita L.A.'s awesome Tsukumen ramen but I was floored by how good the Tsukumen was at this Tokyo Ramenya. I'm not even into Tsukumen! I prefer the non-dipping variety. My kids were even saying things like ""it's not fair to compare Tsujita to this one, dad. We're in Tokyo."" :)  This is at the end of the ramen street, at the corner. Have fun!"

Really added to my repertoire.  Specifically, yuzu(or sudachi) was the game changer.  They've really done it amazingly, since I've had it before.  They also toss  the charsiu on the binchotan to reheat vs most places that just torch to reheat.  Adds a very nice smokey flavor.  And the blend of all different flavors are quite lovely."

Their broth and chashu are both excellent. And they give you a little thing of your choice of oil to add in, so it becomes something totally different halfway through."

ramen,39ct04,AFireInAsa,2,Wed Jun 10 23:19:35 2015 UTC,The regular Nissin Demae Pork Tonkotsu serves as a good base for using up just about any leftovers you have sitting around in the refrigerator.  Much more versatile than the Shin (although the noodles are not as good).

ramen,39212p,pumpkinrum,3,Tue Jun 9 00:45:26 2015 UTC,"It actually tasted really good.  I seared the meat in a pan first, so it didn't cook with the broth/noodles at all.  It was beef ichiban.  I also added cilantro, but that's not pictured.  I always try and use my leftover meat in ramen.  I have a recipe for it in a slowcooker if you're interested in trying it."

ramen,392o66,Ramen_Lord,2,Mon Jun 8 21:40:15 2015 UTC,"The place is kind of small and it filled up right after we got there. We both got shoyu, I want to come back and try the dipping noodles. I'm usually not a fan of thinner noodles (like at Strings)  but they were nice and chewy so I liked them. I thought the broth I was pretty solid, my husband thought so too. The pork was good could have been a little bit more tender but it wasn't chewy or anything. Overall we'll definitely come back."
ramen,3926ky,greggilan,3,Mon Jun 8 18:38:08 2015 UTC,"It's not the best looking bowl of ramen, but it's actually pretty tasty.

ramen,390n8h,Milanocookies56,5,Mon Jun 8 11:30:50 2015 UTC,"Saimi and Sumire... you picked some top shops indeed.   Menya Saimi is probably considered the best bowl of miso ramen in Sapporo. I know for me it was. It has flawless execution in every sense, big bold miso flavor, perfect broth texture, visually stunning. Look at those bright yellow noodles in that white miso base, those perfect pearls of fat suspended above. Their success is sort of lovely, given that the owner of the shop trained at Sumire (Saimi has a homage to them in their shop).   And therefore, a trip to Sapporo really isn't a good one without visiting either Sumire or Junren. Those sister restaurants are culinary legends in the city, if only because of their radical approach to miso ramen that turned it from a homely, calorie laden dish, to a craft.   Gorgeous photos of some amazing ramen, what's not to love?"
ramen,390n8h,Ramen_Lord,2,Mon Jun 8 12:31:47 2015 UTC,"Sumire is probably in my top 3 favorites, but I've never had Saimi before. It looks amazing. It's definitely going on my list of places to check it out next time I am in the area."

ramen,391a5l,RainbowRoadie,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:20:12 2015 UTC,"It gets better over time. Since it's a fermented product, it doesn't really ""go bad"". However, if you don't want your food to be super salty, go for a white miso, as the flavor intensifies with age. Just keep it in the fridge."
ramen,391a5l,Metallio,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:38:30 2015 UTC,"Salt, garlic, black pepper.  Celery powder, onion powder, cumin, basil, these things are optional.  Some sort of spicy pepper sauce or actual peppers is often nice but not necessary.  Oil and salt work wonders...over that (and garlic which I consider a necessity) it's entirely dependent on what flavor you're looking for.  I usually just flavor with vegetables personally, not so much spice.  Cooked meat thrown in adds a lot of flavor as well.  If you don't already use meats I suggest saving scraps and tossing them into your ramen, it'll change your view.  ...also, day old steak in ramen is really good :)."

Miso egg was panna cotta & mango purée made in an Easter egg mold. Narutomaki was dyed swirled fondant ribbons. Pork slices were homemade candied bacon 😋. Green onions were sliced lime sour candy strings (looked pretty realistic!). Topped it all with black sesame and some little swirly Korean crackers for extra decoration.   Served it in a melamine ramen bowl (the prep required freezing it), with spoon & chopsticks, and a little tube of Sriracha2Go on the side filled with hot-cinnamon flavored red icing. (Bf is addicted to real sriracha so this was a must!)  Took me and his best friend (both of us amateurs) about 3-4 days to do all the prep & assembly.  #ianapc"

ramen,38rzi9,MAGICHUSTLE,2,Sun Jun 7 20:31:36 2015 UTC,Oh it was amazing. I have food for like a week haha  The process I used was this recipe:  http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/02/how-to-make-tonkotsu-ramen-broth-at-home-recipe.html  We used only pork feet at vallarta and asked them to chop it up into one inch pieces. About 5 lbs.  Then I realized that /u/Ramen_Lord made a recipe and so we made his tare that you can find here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/ramen/comments/2l2eas/here_it_is_the_granddaddy_of_them_all_homemade_18/  Following the links we made the char sui pork and eggs as directed from serious eats.  http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/03/the-food-lab-ramen-edition-how-to-make-chashu-pork-belly.html  http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/03/the-food-lab-tonkotsu-ramen-part-how-to-make-ajitsuke-tamago-marinated-soft-boiled-eggs.html  Basically it was a pretty long process that we started at 6pm on thursday night and finished everything friday night around 10pm.  We washed the pork bones and brought it to a boil to clean the blood then rinsed them off and the boiling for about 4 or 5 hours until midnight then boiled on low over night and turned it off around 9 am. Got home around 5 and started it up again and kept adding water and condensing until everything was done. Total hours around 18 hours of boiling.   For the tare I couldn't find any sardines that /u/Ramen_Lord suggested but I used dry anchovies and it worked out well.  It was worth it.  Lemme know if you have any questions!

Had to make a few modifications based on where I lived.  We have literally zero pork belly where I live (I tried about a dozen stores) so we had to use pork loin, and I could only find salt pork, not fatback. However, the soup had a fantastic mouth feel and tasted awesome! Our toppings were dried seaweed, marinated eggs from /u/Ramen_Lord, green onions, and pickled ginger.  The chashu itself turned out great, I cooked it at 225 in the oven for about 3.5 hours following a recipe I googled. Then seared it in the pan before serving the next day.  Thank you again to Ramen_Lord for all the advice and great recipes. We absolutely loved how this turned out! I was very nervous through the cooking process because of how difficult people have described this to make. However, I did a little dance once I got to taste it. Was like I was back in my first ramen spot trying it for the first time!"

If you can get your butcher to give you the area of the shoulder with ""the tubes"" as they call it in competitive BBQ, you can make some seriously mean chashu. It won't be as decadent, more meaty, but just as tender and easy to make. You can even use the same method, it just requires a slightly longer cook."

ramen,38pupc,MAGICHUSTLE,3,Fri Jun 5 20:53:40 2015 UTC,"Hey! Nicely done! Glad to know things worked out overall.  I assume the eggs are splotchy just because the brine didn't get all the way around the eggs. If the eggs are touching one another, or the sides of the container, you need to move em around once or twice during the steeping process to get them to be coated evenly. It's pretty much just cosmetic though, yknow?"
ramen,38pupc,gayrudeboys,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:01:12 2015 UTC,"Pretty much cosmetic at that point. ;) I had them about halfway filled in the container and had a cloth over them to soak at the top level.

ramen,38pupc,speelmydrink,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:04:00 2015 UTC,"After lots and lots of bowls, I decided that I prefer using pork shoulder (boston butt, even) to pork belly.  It's easier to work with, for me, it's still nice and fatty, and slices up really well if you tie it up before braising.  Not to mention, it's actually cheaper, per pound, than belly, at my local asian grocer..."
ramen,38nnl0,Rotorist,3,Fri Jun 5 11:37:35 2015 UTC,"Sounds like ""chūka"" noodles (中華) with potato and tapioca starch added to the flour.    I have started making my noodles with potato and tapioca starch (85g of bread flour, 8g tapioca starch, 7g potato starch) and following Ramen_Lord's noodle recipe.  I like the potato and tapioca starch because it gives it that extra chewy and smooth texture.    Also, when drying the noodles for a day, it does get that translucent look you're looking for.  I don't know the chemistry behind that, but if you dissolve tapioca starch in water, it is kinda a light cloudy look.  Potato starch is very milky solid color.  I am still adjusting the ratio of potato and tapioca starch to see if there is any difference in texture and taste."
ramen,38nnl0,shifty21,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:24:51 2015 UTC,I don't think ramen has those kind of starch added. Here's the picture I was referring to:  http://newyork.seriouseats.com/images/2012/09/20121002-yebisu-ramen-09.jpg  That's a straight up ramen

It has sort of gone downhill since it expanded but I still enjoy it (despite the fact that I feel completely sick after). My entire four years in NYC I failed to find a decent tsukemen.

The soup there works excellently for tsukemen; you just need to reduce the broth to a thicker consistency. However, the noodle recipe I developed in tangent needs some tweaks to be appropriate for tsukemen.   This broth is a pretty common Tonkotsu variant, it's darker, almost brown, with big froth and foam, and a deep, gelatinous texture. There's a lot of fish notes, which means it's not for everyone. But if you're into that style, this is a fantastic rendition of the dish if I may say so. Stay tuned!"

ramen,38giga,OnLakeOntario,2,Thu Jun 4 01:33:28 2015 UTC,"This is a tough question... I hate to be the bearer of bad news. And I've also never had Ichiran; it didn't exist where I lived in Japan. But here are my thoughts:   What you've asked for is essentially requesting a shop's seceret sauce... Literally that's what they call it, their ""hiden no tare"" or secret sauce. You can imagine, they won't probably tell the public much about this.  But the sauce (or tare) itself doesn't appear to be some magical, completely unique item. It still uses Japanese/East asian ingredients after all. So here are some guesses:   It probably uses a fermentation of some kind, my guess being similar gochujang. Their website mentions that the sauce ""rests."" suggesting some sort of flavor development happens over time.  It probably has a host of spices in it, much like a shichimi, but probably moreso. They mention it has some odd 30 ingredients (most of which are probably used in minuscule amounts but regardless). I assume it has some form of salt content. Perhaps soy sauce.    So, JUST A GUESS. You can probably make a super makeshift version of this sauce by combining gochujang, ichimi or shichimi for complexity and heat ,and soy sauce/water to thin and add salt. But alas, this is a guess based on what little I could find online. Godspeed sir."
ramen,38giga,Ramen_Lord,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:01:49 2015 UTC,"Hmm... This may be a little more difficult than I expected. I'm almost wondering if it might be a sort of spicy miso? It's worth a shot, I will be using it in tonkotsu ramen."
ramen,38giga,Ramen_Lord,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:01:51 2015 UTC,"If you can find gochujang in the tub (most asian markets should have this), I think you can probably make this makeshift tare fairly easily. It's a korean fermented chili paste made with rice. It's sweet, complex, and has good heat. Should serve you well.   I've made spicy miso before (recipe is here) and you'll see I add gochujang and ichimi."
ramen,38giga,shadymonkey,2,Thu Jun 4 13:56:00 2015 UTC,"I beginning to lean towards tobanjan as I'm finding most gochujang to be a little to sweet for my needs. The corn syrup tends to mask some of my aromatics. What brand are you using, might I ask?"
ramen,38giga,Ramen_Lord,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:03:47 2015 UTC,"Tobanjan is also a great ingredient! For the hot sauce like ichiran's I'm not sure if it would work (as the texture appears different), but I definitely add tobanjan to spicy miso, classic addition.  For gochujang, I've been using sunchang brand. You're right, it's a bit sweet. Perhaps in the hot sauce application, balancing it with some acidity perhaps? It's hard to say without knowing how the secret sauce tastes!"

ramen,385ddu,Vendetta425,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:37:18 2015 UTC,I ask for it extra hot from the kitchen. Because I enjoy my noodles being warmed by hot hot broth. But yes usually the broth cools down. I always request an inside table so my broth doesn't get cold too fast. At Tsujita in LA they will refill your soup with soup stock so I just do that if it gets cold.

The first time my broth was warm and not hot so I started asking for my broth to be extra hot so they give you the steaming broth and the broth pieces on the side and i just dump them in, but i keep the egg outside as I don't want the broth to cook the egg and lose that creamy inside.   If you dont care for eating pork i suggest just getting the one with the egg as the broth has pieces of pork in it and their pork slices arent really to die for.  Just my opinion but I really like em and have eaten them 3 times in the past month. ALSO its cash only so bring like 20 bucks for the soup plus noodle refill and tip"

ramen,380drc,kevysaysbenice,3,Sun May 31 22:37:03 2015 UTC,"I want to thank /u/Ramen_Lord for the recipe, and this subreddit in general for all of the help/advice (I haven't posted much but I've read a lot!).   I have a number of questions, which I've scattered through the blog post, but the main one is this:  Why wasn't my ramen very thick or creamy or rich? Was it simply that I didn't boil the bones enough, or were the bones I used not ideal?  Other questions include   Are the noodles supposed to have a real alkaline taste? I cooked the pork belly for ~3 hours after braising, and it was good but not totally melt in the mouth. Should I have cooked it longer? Or is it the cut of pork or the particular piece of pork belly I had? Others I'm not remembering :)   Thanks again all! <3   [edit: I a word]"
ramen,380drc,Ramen_Lord,2,Sun May 31 22:40:22 2015 UTC,"First of all, thank you for the feedback, and thank you for going on this ramen journey. Fantastic post by the way, very fun to ready I'm always very flattered when people use my recipes. And so much detail!  I'm sorry that the dish didn't turn out quite as good as you hoped, perhaps I can try to remedy the situation. If I can say, ramen is hard. It's incredibly hard. It's the hardest dish a home cook can try to make. Restaurants in America are constantly failing at it. So please don't be discouraged! There will be abject failure on the path (I have made so many horrible bowls of ramen, it's unreal), but eventually things click and the resulting dish is wonderful.   Now... Onto the questions.  Regarding broth thickness: the miso Tonkotsu method is intentionally lighter via chicken, because the tahini and miso in the tare boost a lot of the body. That said, the amount of water you use in the boil will inevitably affect the resulting dish. If you feel the stock is too watery, especially after 12 hours of cooking, it's best to try and boil down the stock somewhat. Evaporating moisture will inevitably help the body of the stock.  I'd say it's NOT an ingredient issue... Your bones look right. It's most likely a water content issue. Hardcore Tonkotsu shops barely cover the bones, meaning the concentration of fat and gelatin in the cooking water is extremely high. But with miso and tahini, it was just too much to me personally.  You can also do a few fail safe checks to confirm that the bones are fully cooked. Is the marrow mostly gone? Is the meat fully separated from the bones? This should be the case. The pot should be filled with what appear to be clean, meat free, spent bones, and a mush of overcooked, spent meat. (Be sure to stir towards the end, as this mush can burn on the bottom of the pot).   Finally, if you're craving that incredible richness, add a trotter or two. That always helps add gelatin, which will help emulsify things and improve the body.  Also, I saw you wrote this, but you can ABSOLUTELY start the Tonkotsu overnight, at the lowest setting on your stovetop. The water, presumably reaching 170 degrees or so, will eventually pasteurize the liquid over time, so it will be entirely safe for consumption despite the low temp. Measure the temp to be sure of course. I believe you can also do this in a crock pot if you have concerns about control. Then in the morning you can ramp things back up to high boil.   Regarding the noodles: I'm actually quite surprised by this! I've found that at 1.5 grams the noodles definitely have that characteristic alkalinity. Another fail safe is to use filtered water instead of tap water, seems to help the flavor somewhat.  And finally... The chashu. I give a general guideline for timing but everyone has a different cut in terms of size and shape, and ultimately it comes down to texture, not time. Feel the pork belly after around 3 hours, it should be soft and very pillowy. Very little spring (though some is good). Sometimes belly is done in 2 hours, sometimes it's done in 4. Trust your gut, cook longer if needed.   Feel free to reach out of you have other questions!"
ramen,380drc,Ramen_Lord,2,Sun May 31 23:13:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, thank you so much for your time and advice and recipe. I really appreciate it. I edited my post to include your words/advice. I think you may just have given me the encouragement to give this another shot.  Thanks again <3"
ramen,380drc,MAGICHUSTLE,1 point,Sun May 31 23:55:44 2015 UTC,"I took another look at your blog and also want to point out, the recipe you used is absolutely a miso ramen recipe.   This might be fault of my own, but I love miso ramen. It's the style that brought me to love ramen. I studied it in college. I lived in Sapporo, the birhtplace of Miso ramen. Without question, miso ramen to me is my favorite thing on earth, and so my recipes with miso are very miso forward. Maybe it's my obsession with the complexities of the fermentation and it's resulting flavors, or the general forwardness of the tare in Sapporo style miso ramen, but I always try to highlight and boost those flavors in miso ramen.   This does not sound like what you were looking for! Which means I have lead you astray!  You wanted something akin to hakata style tonkotsu. For that, I'd direct you to this recipe I developed, making sure to keep the water level juuust above the bones. Start it the night before, keep it on the stove on the lowest of simmers, then crank to high in the morning. Your tonkotsu will be the color of cream, and quite dense. Soy sauce (which you actually sort of did in your blog post) helps balance the funk. You can make the tare described, or use the braising liquid from the chashu (I like the glutamate boost from the fish and kombu, and I don't find them very potent, but they can be hard to find)."
ramen,380drc,Ramen_Lord,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:23:08 2015 UTC,"When braising, do you submerge your pork belly in the liquid or do you keep it partial covered and turn periodically?"
ramen,380drc,MAGICHUSTLE,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:13:23 2015 UTC,"Partially covered, turn periodically. Just want the ambient temp around the pork to be low, helps keep the cooking gentle and promotes collagen breakdown."
ramen,380drc,Ramen_Lord,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:37:55 2015 UTC,"Do you find that even at low temperatures, the salt content of the braising liquid causes it to boil?"
ramen,380drc,Rotorist,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:53:41 2015 UTC,"Not really, as the salt content is high but not THAT high. Salt in general increases the boiling temperature of water.   Still, I don't think it would matter much at all either way (maybe 5 degrees max). The humid air is what you're after, as that high humidity prevents the surrounding air from reaching temps higher than 212 degrees F. This is the primary benefit of a braise, a slow, consistent cook, with a low temperature, and better heat transfer from the humid air and surrounding liquid."
ramen,380drc,Rotorist,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:32:20 2015 UTC,"This is your friend:  http://www.giantunion.com/product_description_cn.php?name=%B3%B7%C6P%A4%F4&itemno=1500401  You can find it in any large chinese market. I don't like too much alkaline taste so I add just 1 tbsp to 500 g flour. The chewiness really comes from the wheat protein (gluten), the alkaline content helps with it being ""tight"" imo.  Try 10 quarts of water with 5 pounds of bones. Leave the soup at a bare minimum rolling boil, not simmering. Simmering is basically bubbles forming but rolling boil is a fast convection, which agitates the bones constantly and brings out all the gelatin and fat. 12-15 hours of rolling boil is needed to create the thick creamy soup."
ramen,380drc,Rotorist,1 point,Sun May 31 23:29:43 2015 UTC,"I'll look for this and give it a shot. To be honest I think that the noodles I made actually were pretty good and had a decent consistency, I was just surprised that I could taste the alkalinity.   Out of curiosity,    Can you give me the exact measurements (preferably by weight) of all of the ingredients you use? Can you tell me how you knead the dough?   I make ""normal"" egg pasta quite often, and when I do I find it's very important to really knead the dough enough. You don't need to knead it that much, but I find the pasta to be firmer and chewier and more to my liking if I take the extra effort and sweat (gross) and really work the dough before I let it rest. I'm wondering if the same is true for ramen, or if it's a preference thing. I realize that working the dough really helps to develop the gluten and elasticity of the dough when I roll it out.  Thank you!"

ramen,37x3xm,Ramen_Lord,2,Mon Jun 1 03:10:04 2015 UTC,"Ok, easy enough!  All three are the same in general prep:   Heat a large pot of water to a boil Add some of this water to the seasoning liquid in your serving bowl. Mix to combine, and the broth is done. Make sure the seasoning packet is warm before mixing with the water. In the large pot with the remaining liquid, cook your noodles. Add the cooked noodles to your bowl.   The real differences are in how much liquid you use for broth, and how long the noodles need to cook.  For the leftmost one:   270 ml water for broth 1 min 30 seconds for noodles  For the middle one:  270 ml water for broth 1 min 30 seconds for noodles  For the rightmost one:  220 ml water for broth 45-50 seconds for noodles.

ramen,37mir4,Ramen_Lord,3,Fri May 29 02:36:53 2015 UTC,Suggestions are welcome on what type of soup to use with my miso.
ramen,37mir4,Barcade,3,Thu May 28 19:29:09 2015 UTC,"You may recall that I have a tonkotsu miso recipe, but the broth has a lot of chicken to lighten the body and flavor. For miso, i almost always go with a clear pork/chicken broth. Dead simple, good gelatin content but not very thick. Meaty flavor with hints of vegetal. This sort of stock is really the ""standard"" of Sapporo style miso. When you consider the other areas that fat is introduced (the tare, the large amount in the wok or aroma oil, the sesame) it makes sense to scale back the intensity of the broth. Even miso on its own can add richness.  Really, miso ramen is a good example of the relationship between tare and soup. And you as a ramen cook should play with this relationship. There is a natural fallout where some ramen dishes focus on the soup as the main focal point, others on the tare. The point is that there are no hard and fast rules; your focus is going to change how you approach the dish. For me a good Miso ramen is more about the tare, while hakata is much more about the broth! But that might not be how you feel. And that's ok! Its just how you see the two components working together.   Check the recipe in the sidebar if you haven't, and feel free to ask if you have any questions.  With that awesome miso I'm very curious to see what's next!"

I'm considering a lighter soup of pork, chicken, or dashi in some combination for my next miso ramen, but that won't happen for another week or two.

They're in the guides, they're on TV, it's the big times. So much so that they've actually opened a 2nd shop that primarily sells a beef/miso ramen.  But you'll notice... Pretty clear soup! What's going on??  Below is just my personal opinion and evidence I've had through experimentation, but beef ramen should not be made paitan style. (Paitan meaning hard boiled to emulsify fat to a creamy white consistency). I think places like Matador know this, their soups are clean and light, very little fat.  I feel like much of this is because the flavor of beef fat, particularly from the marrow bones, is much more aggressive than pork or chicken fat in its flavor profile. This fat tastes awesome in a caramelized, deeply charred steak, or a lovely melt in your mouth shortrib. It does not taste good in water. I tried... It just wasn't there. It misses the texture.  If OP is interested in making beef ramen, I would highly recommend not cooking the bones hard. It tastes like the runoff of hamburgers, can be really off putting. Cook them the French way. Roast them to develop that flavor commonly associated with cuts of beef. Cook them really gently for a clean, clear extraction. Remove the fat (replace with a milder one or infuse it heavily with aromatics)."
ramen,37ozy1,Ramen_Lord,3,Fri May 29 11:49:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for saving me a bad experiment, lol :)   I'm not sure if you ever tried cooking beef soup, it seems like beef is quite flavorless in water, unlike chicken/pork. Clear beef soup is much like pho which I had a lot of experience with, and pho is very light in flavor (most restaurants have to add MSG), especially without the spices. Considering the fact that ramen usually pairs with soup with strong flavor, I can hardly see how pho soup without the spice can work with ramen. I was hoping cooking the beef paitan style might bring out more flavor but like you said it would be offputting.   However when done the chinese way, beef soup (along with chilli pepper and spices) goes very well with bland noodle (i.e. non alkaline, I tried using alkaline noodle but the flavor doesn't match):  http://i.imgur.com/tExE1t6.jpg  So it's kind of hard to visualize the taste of Matador's clear beef soup :)"

We cleaned the kitchen spotless each and every night!   Definitely try the shiro or aka ramen, don't forget to ask for kaedama! :D Even though the pork buns are hella pricy, it's worth it for a one-time thing :)   Momofuku IMO is overhyped, the first time I went there when I got to NYC I was so underwhelmed...   Rai Rai Ken and Ivan Ramen are good too! Although I feel they're really into strange kinds of ramen at Ivan. Breakfast ramen sounds kinda weird imo at least.   Edit: And totto!

You can find it at most stores, in a refrigerated section (not frozen) and sometimes unrefrigerated in vacuum-sealed pouches/tubs. It will often be shelved near tofu, and sometimes eggs. You cook it however the recipe says, stirring it into warm water is all you need. Just treat it as any other paste-like condiment. You need to refrigerate it after opening and it will go bad eventually (time dependent on the salt-content).

ramen,37e00t,sean_incali,3,Wed May 27 13:22:42 2015 UTC,Miso is a fermented soybean bean paste. It's used for making miso soup to accompany sushi.   And they also make ramen broth using it as well. Usually it's made into a broth for the ramen first. Then Noodles are added along with the toppings.
ramen,37e00t,bruddahmacnut,1 point,Wed May 27 05:08:19 2015 UTC,"So  if I'm  understanding  right  the  paste is  mixed in  to  hot water  to make  a broth, similar to bullion  cubes  to  make  beef or chicken broth."
ramen,37e00t,Igordatigor,1 point,Wed May 27 11:51:18 2015 UTC,Yeah. It's also pretty salty so use sparingly if you're adding it to the noodle broth packet. I usually use half a packet anyway.

ramen,37e00t,eldercitizen,3,Wed May 27 04:31:21 2015 UTC,"It adds a savoury umami flavour to your broth. I usually use a tablespoon of red miso paste per portion (400 ml) of broth. But I guess it's depending on the kind of miso paste you have, and according to taste. You can just add a spoon to the hot broth and stir, before you add in your noodles. It's also great in egg drop soup."

How to  actually use it and  flavor  wise,  thank  you  for taking the time  to  explain,  now  I can  actually  try  to use  it  with  half an idea  of what to do.  It  sounds like  a bullion cube  for  other  umami  flavors,  mix  with  your  water/broth to  add  flavor.

ramen,37ah0h,flexoman,3,Tue May 26 18:07:39 2015 UTC,"I started playing with instant ramen about a year ago when I left home. I finally discovered a great default formula I use almost everytime I make it now. I'm talking packet ramen of course, because there's obviously more options when you are cooking everything in a pot instead of a microwave container. Starting from what you add to the boiling water first to last.  Frozen veggies + Fridge veggies (depending on what you have available) + Crack egg into water to poach + Noodles + Season packet + Condiments to taste = Happiness.   My favorite combination so far is spicy or miso flavored ramen packet with frozen broccoli, matchstick cut carrots, a poached egg, then serve it sprinkled with some sesame oil and green onion. I still do poached eggs because I have yet to master the perfect soft boiled egg. A lot of people opt out of the flavor packet to begin with for health reasons (enough sodium to kill a horse). I have yet to try boulion or some sort of stock that I season myself. that's my next experiment."
ramen,37ah0h,lefond,1 point,Tue May 26 05:13:23 2015 UTC,"The soft poached egg I've done so far have been gorgeous, after a few attempts. Here it is: -water at a soft boil in a pot -gently deposit the egg ( right out of the fridge ) into the pot. If you have a slotted spoon or better yet a spider, let the egg sit on the spider whilst in the water. It'll make sure the egg doesn't crack due to bouncing. Let it go for 6 minutes to 6:30. -dump the egg into ice water for about a minute and gently peel the egg. Emphasis on gently.   That should do it! Play around in that time range and you should be good.  Enjoy"

Egg, veggie, herbs (asian market has lotta herbs you can try out, most of them will go well with the noodle),   Meat like beef...you can go to asian market and buy beef eye round, ask them to thin slides the cut for you..Divide them into packages in ziplock bag and use what you need.  Seaweed, fried shallot/garlic  Instant noodle/ramen is very forgiving so you know just play around, mess with it..Have fun experimenting and you'll find a combo you'll love. Just beware of the sodium intake + fat / package."

ramen,37ah0h,Xoimgx,1 point,Tue May 26 14:36:08 2015 UTC,"you can still do most of the listed stuff :) herbs add a nice kick to it but without them it'll be ok. You can try to saute the beef on a pan with some garlic, shallot, soy sauce, pepper, tomatoes then add it to your ramen. It's a bit more of xtra work but it's worth it imo."
ramen,37ah0h,Flonkus,1 point,Tue May 26 09:04:57 2015 UTC,"Depending on your store, even a regular American market might have some sheets of toasted seaweed that are great to crumble up and put in your ramen.  Also some sesame oil is an easy way to add a whole dimension of Asian flavor to your otherwise plain and generic ramen.  I always toss a little sesame oil, seaweed and a soft boiled egg into my shin ramyun.  If you don't live near a real Asian grocery market maybe shin ramyun isn't available. But these ingredients should really help cheap ramen out a lot as well.  I also like to season and saute a few pieces of shrimp if you happen to have any available."

ramen,376878,ToastedMuffin,2,Wed May 27 02:38:43 2015 UTC,Just something we had in the fridge so we thought it might be a good way to use it up/add another vegetable. My boyfriend and I were disagreeing on which vegetables to add so this was just something neutral that we both liked. The dish was really assembled based on our personal preferences
ramen,376878,ToastedMuffin,1 point,Wed May 27 02:56:38 2015 UTC,All i know is that i would eat the ever loving god out of this...Also i think that my girlfriend would love it too if i was able to get a good recipe.
ramen,376878,ToastedMuffin,1 point,Thu May 28 22:14:28 2015 UTC,"Oh my goodness! I forgot to reply. Here's what we did to create this ramen bowl: My boyfriend is not big on cooking, so his job was to make soft boiled eggs while I did everything else. So you can do that at the beginning if you'd like and keep them, peeled, in the fridge until you're ready. If you don't know how to make soft boiled eggs, just google it, I'm sure that's what he did. So for the mise en place, take the beef out of the fridge and salt&pepper it, set it aside (at room temp). Get all the vegetables and aromatics ready to go. Grate 1 inch of ginger, maybe have a bit more sliced and on hand in case the broth isn't flavorful enough for you later on. Chop 2 cloves of garlic. Chop a few tbsp of onion. Cut 2 stalks of lemongrass in half or quarters so they fit in your pot. If you have any fresh chilies, chop them up. We just used a chili sauce. You can also use dried chili flakes. Slice a handful of spinach. Slice half or a quarter of a cucumber. Slice 2 green onions. Quarter maybe 8 or 10 mushrooms.  Now that everything's ready to go, you can start cooking. Grab a decent-sized pot that will fit your broth and noodles, all cooking will be done in this pot. Heat some butter and sesame oil in the pot until it's really quite hot. Gently place the beef in the pot. Cook both sides until they have a nice sear, and if there are some browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot, that's okay. That's good flavor. If you're not satisfied with the doneness of the meat after searing both sides you can put it in the oven to finish it off.  Add a bit more butter and/or sesame oil and add the mushrooms to the pot (once the meat is removed and set aside). When the mushrooms are done, take them out and add the garlic, fresh chili if using, onion, ginger and lemongrass. After about a minute, add beef broth, I think we added about 1L. At this point we added some random Asian sauces we had around, like soy sauce, oyster sauce, chili sauce, mirin. If you want to add any dried herbs and spices, go ahead. Taste it, see if it needs anything. Be creative, adjust the seasoning until you like how it tastes. My boyfriend does not like bold flavors so you may find that you need more ginger, lemongrass or garlic.  When you are liking the flavor and everything has had time to infuse, remove the lemongrass and any sliced ginger. Now add the noodles. When they are cooked, slice the meat and the eggs and you should have everything ready to go to assemble your bowls! If anything needs clarifying or you have any questions, please let me know!"

ramen,36di6q,shakewell,3,Mon May 18 20:35:22 2015 UTC,"I felt the Myojo Chukazanmai oriental style you linked wasn't very impressive. Tasted pretty similar to top ramen oriental but with better noodles. On the other hand, their miso flavor is fantastic, it's an automatic buy when I'm at the local japanese market.  I've heard good things about the Nissin Raoh though, it's on my list to try out."
ramen,36di6q,bhene,1 point,Tue May 19 01:22:12 2015 UTC,"Yep, basically what I look for from the instants is good quality noodles. I can always tweak the flavor with dashi and miso and spices, but good noodles is key. I like the Nissin noodles a bit more, they're thinner but seem to have better texture.  The Penang White Curry Noodles on the other hand, is all about the curry soup mix. The noodles are good too but the soup takes it to another level. I like to add fishballs or tofu balls from the asian market to it, makes for a whole filling meal."

ramen,369cbz,unsurebutwilling,3,Sun May 17 13:10:33 2015 UTC,"So, after /u/Ramen_Lord 's 101 yesterday, I was again reminded of finally getting started with my stock, which I in fact then did.   I followed his recipe, with the exception that it was only chicken bones & carcasses. No pork. I let it ""almost""-cook for 6 hours until 1 am, then went to bed and put it on for another 4 hours in the morning.  The result is something of texture and body, but since there's no salt in it, it's really not über tasty in itself. It becomes glorious, however, with the tare. I used the recipe from the same post.  My Asian Supermarket had, however, only one type of miso paste (brown one) and I used fresh chilis instead of ichimi. The rest I followed exactly as described in the linked post.   Lastly, I do know it's for tonkotsu ramen only, but I made some mayu yesterday as well (as you can see in the second picture) and though it's really really rough on it's own, it really increases intensity in the ramen. Amazing. I followed Kenji's recipe.  I made some spinach and champignons as a topping. And I only now realize that I wanted to use corn as well, what the hell..."
ramen,369cbz,Ramen_Lord,1 point,Sun May 17 13:28:38 2015 UTC,"This is super impressive, really nicely done.. Looks great.  You're right that mayu generally isn't paired with miso, but I don't see why it would be an issue. Has components found elsewhere in the dish. Anything you think you might change?"
ramen,369cbz,CharlyWithAWhy,1 point,Sun May 17 16:44:28 2015 UTC,"It's the first time I made ramen how it's supposed to be (before I made it like this) so I can't stress how happy I am with the result. It really has a full body of flavor, before it was intense, but just fell flat when it came to the body. Plus, stock from cubes doesn't have the texture of a real broth.   What I'm looking into next will be pork broth and different types of miso, though, like I said, my Asian supermarket only had one type, maybe I have to look around. Maybe also look into Tonkotsu, now that I already have the mayu."
ramen,369cbz,wirbelvvind,2,Sun May 17 22:23:33 2015 UTC,"As someone who works at a traditional Japanese ramen restaurant, this is very impressive! I haven't seen mayu used in anything but tonkotsu, but I'll ask our head chef what his impression of putting mayu in miso ramen is to him.   We cook our broths for about 12 hours in giant pots. I'm glad you took the time to cook yours as well! Yours looks very delicious."
ramen,36b2x8,Hidden_Beard,3,Sun May 17 22:46:49 2015 UTC,"In university I started out with just frozen vegetables and siracha. After I moved out and gained a full fridge I've started seasoning the broth with soy sauce, siracha, miso paste, rice vinegar, etc. Frozen veg is still really easy to do. If you have some  meat (I marinate pork shoulder) you can saute thin slices in your pot along with some mushrooms and garlic and ginger and then make your noodles in the pot. Adding an egg is also super easy to do."
ramen,36b2x8,dudeabmr,1 point,Sun May 17 23:26:26 2015 UTC,"I'm still looking for addons myself. So far I regularly add crushed garlic, crushed ginger, miso, sesame oil, and menma (store bought). I've started adding a bit of doubanjiang for some spice (a little goes a long way).   Previously, I've also tried freeze dried shitake mushrooms and sliced button mushrooms. The shitake restored very well after soaking in warm water, but I felt they weren't a good fit as they retained too much of their own flavor. The button mushrooms were a much more neutral addition and actually picked up some flavor after soaking them in the ramen broth.  I'm thinking of trying sliced woodear mushrooms since I like their texture and maybe either cabbage or baby spinach for the vegetable option. Sliced green onion is a common topping that I would add if I ever remembered to actually buy it.  Also, regarding instant ramen, I've tried a few different kinds of ramen and so far this one is my favorite. Both because the default flavor is great (broth and noodles) and the directions aren't as fiddly as some others can get."
ramen,36b2x8,bhene,1 point,Mon May 18 00:47:00 2015 UTC,Just make your own broth and buy fresh noodles. I know that this sub enjoys instant but imo it's so much worse than putting the work in and making it yourself.  Though at the end of the day whatever makes you happy you should pursue!

ramen,365k71,TheyCallMeMaster,2,Sat May 16 10:17:32 2015 UTC,"Depends on the thickness of your noodles. The standard Mr Noodles and Ichiban are a bit too thick to set, unless you like your noodles really chewy and almost al dante. If you have thinner noodles like Nissin Chicken Ramen, then letting it set in boiled water works perfectly. You can even take it camping and just fill the bag with hot water, clothespin the top and eat in about 3 minutes!  If you want your noodles to just be tastier, you should add the seasoning packet to the water before it boils, so when you cook the noodles in the water, the noodles will rehydrate itself with the seasoned water, instead of just being surrounded by seasoned water.  Hope this helps!"

It's a great idea for the site, but seriously, you can't go around posting your link to threads that aren't even related to recipes. Kind of leaves a ""bad taste"" (pun intended) in our mouths."
ramen,35w9kd,bruddahmacnut,6,Thu May 14 03:42:34 2015 UTC,"In addition to being a ramen nerd, I work in marketing. Let's start with the basics. I'm gonna give it to you straight: I have some serious questions and critiques when looking at your website and plan overall:   Your website has no ""About us"" page, so anyone who stumbles onto the page has no idea what it's about, except for a few noodle posts. An About us page helps with SEO too. And it will help you identify the goals of the website, not just for visitors, but yourself too.  The posts are borderline empty, many of them don't have actual recipes, and the photos look like stock images. It screams unauthentic. When someone goes to this website, they're bound to see a post, want more, realize nothing is there, and leave. Your website needs substance! It needs to feel authentic! How much time are you willing to invest in this? Is this a side project or a full time business opportunity? Your answer here is going to determine your overall goals for the growth of the website. But if it's a side project, don't be surprised if it takes time to gain traction, you get out what you put in.  Have you asked yourself if this is a website people actually need? Entrepreneurs need to be sure their ideas are improvements or new concepts. What does your platform provide that can't be found elsewhere? This difference needs to be FRONT and CENTER of your business (your ""unique selling proposition""). Right now it's just a website where people can post recipes, and those recipes happen to be about noodles. There are a multitude of these options out there already. Is there a sustainable segment of the market looking for a place to find quality instant noodle recipes? Are these recipes hard to find through other means?    Marketing is not just about promoting your platform, it's about understanding your market and providing a product people will desire. Good marketers don't just spam ads or blast emails, they work with the rest of the business to make sure customers are intrigued, purchasing, and satisfied. Promotions are just the first tool for a marketer."

Since you are asking people to rate, why not put ratings even earlier, in the listing, instead of on the single page view of the picture. You can prompt people to ""be the first to rate!"". There is no call to action for your visitors - e.g., ""Share a picture now and let the world know how you like it"". Next/prev, random, or thumbnail nav would be cool too."

Make the site not look dead before trying to market it, even if it's a lie and everything is just by you. If there isn't any content to consume, the site isn't worth much to visitors.   When I opened the link, I was greeted by a few posts that were from users with ""test"" in the name. Might just be because I am a developer myself, but if everything is from test users, then to me there is nothing there.

ramen,35nt54,pumpkinrum,2,Tue May 12 04:22:08 2015 UTC,Would you mind posting the recipe for your broth? It looks awesome.
ramen,35nt54,fluffhead77,5,Tue May 12 16:21:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks!   I differed my approach to normal ramen a bit in that I made a normal non-ramen seasoned stock first and then did a separate broth for the ramen itself, as I like to save some stock for non-ramen things.  So for the base stock: I get about 3-4 pounds of pork bones, and a pound or so of leftover chicken parts, usually backs, some tips of wings, etc that I have been saving in the freezer. Usually it runs about 2/3 pork bones and 1/3 chicken, less or more is fine. I like to cut the extreme porkiness with the chicken. A bit of meat attached to the bones is what you want, and some nice joints for the collagen.  Roast all the bones anything that will fit in your oven, sheet pans are great for this or cast iron skillets, I do about 30-40 mins at 400f, or until everything is nice and browned.  I toss this all in the slow cooker, add a couple carrots, one or two onions depending on size, and celery if you like. You can do some garlic if you like. I try to keep the flavoring on the stock minimal, and have done it with no vegetables, there will be enough of the ramen ingredients to flavor it later on, but I think the vegetables gives it a more rounder sweeter flavor.  Do it on a steady but minimal simmer for 10-15 hrs, and keep an eye on it, for the ramen I don't care if there are floaty bits of stuff, it makes it tasty. (this is not going to be a clear stock). At this point you are probably fine, but I like to at least do a 24hr cook, and if I have the time i'll just leave it on for another day on very low (barely a simmer).   After you're done, strain it all out, and put it in something that will hold all the stock, cool it outside your fridge, then toss it in the fridge for a few hours or until it gets cold. The crazy amount of fat will rise to the top, and you can just skim it off. Otherwise your broth can be extremely greasy.   For the ramen broth itself, I love the momofuku ramen recipe, and I only follow it loosely, and probably not in any way correct in terms of a 'real' ramen broth, but it's quite good:  This is for 1-2qts of ramen broth: Brown some cubed slab bacon in a pot that will hold your portion of ramen broth, around a cup. And then add your broth. I leave the fat from the bacon in the broth, but you can take it out of you want.  I simmer it with some cleaned scallion ends, or an onion, a sheet or so of kombu, and either ground up dried shiitake and/or some shiitake stems. I usually do about 1/2 cup of ground shiitake or a good couple handfuls of stems (save your stems!), or combination of both. Add some mirin and sake or rice wine (quarter cup each or so)  I toss in a good portion of bonito flakes too 1/2 cup or so.   After half an hour of simmering, take the kombu out (it can get goopy and make your broth taste off). Save the Kombu! I like to fry it really quickly in  a skillet and toss it on top of the finished ramen.  Season your broth to taste with soup base/seasoning soy sauce, any extra salt you like, a small dash of sesame oil, I let it simmer for 10-20 mins and integrate.   All set! Again my recipe is likely doing something (or many things) wrong in someone's book (or according to years of expertise, haha) , so check out other's recipes before attempting :)"

ramen,35pfp4,polstyle,3,Tue May 12 13:00:21 2015 UTC,"Hi there! Sorry about the delay!  Unfortunately, this is sort of a complex question. Each item has seperate functions, and we haven't even discussed the use of skulls, which is surprisingly common in Hakata. Brains and eyeballs and all.  I imagine this is stupidly porky. That sort of viscousity comes from high gelatin content, so definitely amping up the trotter amount and boiling hard. I can only guess, but if I had to take a shot (as I did something ridiculously gelatinous a few weeks back), I'd imagine half femur, and the other half being equal levels of foot and neck bone.  After a serious cleaning of course, those femurs create the most foul odor if not cleaned properly. Soak, blanch, do whatever you need to do to get rid of the funk.  It's worth noting that as you cook a tonkotsu, that smell subsides. I've had tonkotsu going that smelled completely rank at hour 7, and by hour 10 it was a light, barely fragrant liquid nectar.   The thing to do unfortunately is experiment, see what works for you. There is no silver bullet."

ramen,35lqpy,SauteedGoogootz,1 point,Tue May 12 14:17:34 2015 UTC,"Kitakata was super interesting. Both of those places are kind of hot spots, with usual waits of up to 2 hours. We got lucky in that we were there at the tail end of Golden Week, so no one was around.  I can't imagine waiting 2 hours for that first bowl, but the second bowl was pretty stellar (and ridiculously salty). Japanese guy next to me whispered ""hisashiburi desu"" when he received his bowl!  Most interesting of all is that they seem to be primarily pork-based, and are referred to as assari tonkotsu, which sort of upended my impression that tonkotsu = cloudy pork broth."

Extra eggs would have been 100 yen more.   All the more galling that standard, at least in NYC, is 13-15 bucks a bowl. And I'd prefer any of them, even the korrakkuen chain ones, to a vast majority, if not all, of NYC bowls."

ramen,35nstv,Ramen_Lord,1 point,Tue May 12 14:25:24 2015 UTC,"Still working on a business plan!  And in the meantime, sourcing ingredients, getting contacts, and taking a lot of classics with my local SBA.  All the while, we're scheduling tastings, and just recently ordered some larger equipment so that we might hold larger tastings.  All of the surveys taken have been unanimously positive, so we're really optimistic.  And we already have the support of several local pubs who have offered to host our soft opening whenever that is.  Biggest thing will be raising capital, convincing a bank to give us money, etc.  We're thinking of maybe doing a kickstarter.  I thought it would be hilarious to theme it like a videogame pre-order.  So you're essentially paying for your first bowl of ramen (and added perks if you pay more).  We're working as fast as we can.    Also, if anyone knows of a boiler manufactured or available in the US that will take traditional/ramen basket strainers, we're in desperate search."
ramen,35nstv,Ramen_Lord,1 point,Tue May 12 21:40:02 2015 UTC,"My process for this was that this is a bowl for me, so I put everything I wanted in it.    Pork belly (braised in a chashu marinade not that different from the hundreds you'll see online.  Soy sauce, sake, mirin, sugar, garlic, onion, ginger)  Ground pork, which I just browned with some garlic and chili paste.  Menma (which I actually just made my first batch of homemade or from/scratch here:  https://instagram.com/p/2l4pF-FrIq/?taken-by=nicksramenstop and OMG this is really on point)  Green onion (I so badly want to get a cutting machine but they're so expensive.  I don't have a culinary background really.  I just love ramen and make it a lot, so I suck at chopping, etc).  I've actually been replanting the green onions' bulbs to regrow them.  It works!  Bean sprouts (I usually just throw these in the wok after I've browned the pork, for a few seconds)  Blanched spinach (I usually do this last in the water I boiled the noodles in, since I have very little room in my kitchen)  Nori - I get whatever is cheap, most of the time.  If I were in Japan, or a larger metropolitan area where there was competition, I would be more inclined to pay more for high quality, but again, most of our guinea pigs haven't been able to discern good from cheap, so it's difficult for me to pay more for what my customer base may not value.  Egg - left off.  I'm not a fan, even though I like making them.  Corn - I just use frozen corn on this, and I generally throw in a liberal amount of butter as they're cooking.  As far as the broth goes, I use just a chicken stock when I'm making miso.  For shoyu, I do a 2/3 chicken stock to 1/3 dashi stock (I generally keep containers frozen to use as needed), on top of the shoyu tare (which again, is my own tweaking based on the countless recipes out there.  I've also had help from a few japanese friends, hahaha).  For the miso, I use a tare and miso paste on top of just chicken stock.  As a mobile vendor with limited space, we're going to have to get creative with our stock, in terms of keeping cost down but still maintaining a high degree of integrity.  We're setting up some blind taste tests to check preference between the stocks made different ways.  In the instances where we've tried instant chicken stock, we would generally add various parts to the stock pot in addition to the stock, to give it a little more depth and richness;  chicken carcuses and feet, maybe some pork bones or trotters, etc.  And I would drop a few onions and garlic heads in as well.    We haven't decided whether or not we're gonna go that route, but it's surprisingly good for what amounts to a workaround.  Right now we're having some trouble sourcing a proper bowl that is disposable yet will hold up to hot soup.  It's been no easy task, but I'm enjoying it immensely, and learning a lot as I go."

ramen,35aa90,magnadoodle,3,Fri May 8 12:49:38 2015 UTC,"The technique of making pork bone (or beef bone) soup base is actually not simmering - it's fast boiling over a long time. The proper bone soup should look white and cloudy (check out mine below)  http://i.imgur.com/JZ8ZLnO.jpg  And soup can only be made cloudy by boiling on high heat for many hours. The high heat boiling agitates the bones and force out the collagen. Simmering can cook out the collagen from meat but not bones. On a side note, I avoid using shitake mushroom as much as possible with pork soup because the mushroom flavor is extremely strong and can cover up the pork flavor (by the way, if you cook the broth on high heat you get a totally different flavor than if you do low simmer). So throwing one or two is ok but no more.  So the way I make pork bone soup base is first soak the bone (like you did), then I will boil them in a pot of water on high heat for about 15min. This forces out the blood. Then I wash the bones under water tap and put them in a LARGE pot of clean water. Add the kumbu and benito flakes, and boil at high heat. You will need a LOT of water to accomplish the soup base, because the fast boiling reduces the water a lot. I plan for at least 3 times the water. So if I want to produce a quart of soup base, I put three quarts of water and reduce down to one quart.  How long does it take? At least 15 hours, before the soup turns properly cloudy and white. Pros do even more to develop stronger flavor. You can see making pork bone soup base is a very lengthy and fuel-consuming process."

ramen,35aa90,ramen_minion,2,Fri May 8 18:55:51 2015 UTC,"I did not boil 12 quarts of water lol. I have a 12 quarts pot but I only put maybe 8 quarts of water in it. I seal the lid as tight as possible (I weigh it down with a skillet) and set heat  (I have gas stove) on medium, basically maintaining a rolling boil, you don't need too much activities there. Then I sleep for 6 hours and the soup is only reduced for about 1/4 afterwards."

ramen,35aa90,heavymetalandtea,2,Mon May 11 23:37:39 2015 UTC,"Looks delicious!  I've tried the same method of cooking the pork and aromatics in the dashi, but didn't get such nice looking results.  I found the veg broke down too much in the long cook and those broken down particles took on a brown colour as it boiled.  The result was a dark broth, almost the colour of a brown ale, with a slightly bitter note.  I ended up making it work but it wasn't my best attempt by far."
ramen,35aa90,brownox,2,Fri May 8 16:03:13 2015 UTC,Two things to learn from mistakes in this post:   Boil hard and fast and long.  10-12 hours is usually a minimum for home equipment with downtime adding water and lost heat. Veggies go in at the end for 1 hour.  That's it.

A trick I learned that has worked perfectly so far for me is to put about 6 eggs in a pot, only fill it up with about 1/2-inch of water, then boil them for the usual amount of time with a lid on.  Using the steam to cook the eggs instead of the water itself gives you a perfectly consistent half-dozen eggs."

ramen,350wh4,warm_vanilla_sugar,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:01:24 2015 UTC,"Boil first, then put them in. If you refrigerate your eggs, I find it helpful to put them in a container of warm tap water while waiting on the boiling water. This helps prevent the shell cracking from the shock of going from cold to boiling, and it will also make any hairline cracks in the shell visible. Try to avoid eggs that have hairline fractures and the whites of the egg may leak out while cooking and it'll mess up the egg."
ramen,350wh4,schematicboy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:06:35 2015 UTC,"Good idea with the warm tap water. I often make large batches of eggs and a couple pop each time, that should help a lot. Do you have any tricks for peeling them? I've tried putting vinegar in the water with mixed results..."
ramen,350wh4,warm_vanilla_sugar,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:17:03 2015 UTC,"For soft-boiled eggs, I use a blunt object (like the handle of a large spoon) to tap and crack the shell all over. Then I just peel away under a stream of warm tap water. The water will get between the egg white and the membrane and help separate the two. With the shell pre-cracked, it should be easy to peel it away in a few seconds."

The way the lady described it on the cooking video (I'm almost sure I saw it from this sub a while ago), it's the steam cooking it in equal sides and temperatures and pressures that give it its consistency, so it should work in theory.

ramen,353v7d,RamenFiend,1 point,Wed May 6 21:52:14 2015 UTC,"Nice. I prefer my yolk more firm.  The most important part of my method is: Room Temperature Eggs.

Put them in an ice bath for a few minutes, carefully peel and slice."

There are tons of news articles about food incidents in China. Here is a long list of food safety incidents in China. The two most scandalous one are the 2008 Milk Scandal and 2010 Gutter Oil.

Late addition of leeks, yellow onion, garlic, and golden delicious apple. Thin noodles of 42 percent hydration, fermented two days. Apricot wood smoked Berkshire pork shoulder (wood from a sadly dying tree in my yard) paired with pickled collard greens. Sake braised pork belly paired with ramp leaf kimchi. Ten year vintage, homemade umeboshi apricot. Umeboshi shio taré. Stirfried pheasantback mushrooms, locally foraged. Six-minute egg, ajisuke. Spice paste bomb.   Probably the most elaborate set I've done to date."

ramen,34yfss,shadymonkey,2,Fri May 8 07:01:50 2015 UTC,"I see that /u/Ramen_Lord has already answered your query while I was uploading some pics to show you, but I figured some more details wouldn't hurt.  I too use the Koon Chun brand as opposed to the baked soda method. I used about a tsp to bring the total hydration to 45% in this example.  I use half as much B2 as /u/Ramen_Lord 's recipe. You can see it's not very much at all: https://i.imgur.com/9XNW5SC.jpg. This is about .05mg B2 per portion.  This batch was a little softer than I really wanted. You can see that it's still fairly crumbly, but pliable.  Just a few passes through a pasta machine evens the texture out. This is after an hour rest, btw. In this picture you can compare the color to a yellow dishcloth. It's quite tinted, with it shading towards a greenish hue.  Rolled thin, cut to length, and viewed on a bamboo board, the noodle dough has lost its greenish-ness. I think the greenish color is from the opacity of a mound of dough, although it's quite possible there's an oxidation effect.   Cut noodles ready to be tossed in potato starch. You can see the color difference.  Entire album"
ramen,34yfss,mudokipo,2,Tue May 5 20:49:29 2015 UTC,Very nice!  :) Thank you for the details. I'm very familiar with that green hue. It's due to oxydation of the dough after being exposed to air. I age my dough overnight so it becomes a dark green color until I cook it lol
ramen,34yfss,joopdawoop,2,Tue May 5 21:01:49 2015 UTC,"The green hue is further driven by the egg content. If you use just egg white, or no egg at all, the greenish tint will reduce. I think it's purely cosmetic though, and it seems to disappear after cooking."

Not a huge fan of the pungent smell and chewy texture, but haven't had an overly fermented taste like something you would get with those fermented soy beans. My favorite Ramen so far is Kotsurri Tantanmen and doesn't have the bamboo.   Ramen is like my new favorite food though, so even with the bamboo I tear it up."
ramen,34pfa8,mywifebroughtmehere,1 point,Sun May 3 13:30:53 2015 UTC,I LOVE it in mine. The ramen place I frequent in Las Vegas has delicious menma. It doesn't taste like it has been soaked in the triple threat. It taste like bamboo shoots. I could be wrong though.
ramen,34pfa8,riceandsoysauce,1 point,Sun May 3 16:09:14 2015 UTC,"Instead of menma, how about making fresh bamboo for your ramen.   Select one that is heavy and firm, with a fresh, firm outer skin. The base of the shoot should be as white as possible. Do not get any that have black spots or soft when pressed.  To prepare it: Trim off the cut end until it is completely white. Cut a slit down the length of the shoot and peel off the sheaths and trim off the tip. Cover the entire peeled bamboo with white rinse water from when you wash rice. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 30 min. or until soft enough to poke through the bamboo with a toothpick.   Cool completely in cold water and then slice into thin strips. Toss the strips with sesame oil and sea salt. Put the fresh bamboo into your ramen and enjoy or eat as is."

ramen,34ly1c,terrytoy,2,Sat May 2 09:45:52 2015 UTC,"I made the food not the photograph (but it is a picture of my food :) Recipe added  This is slow food, the chashu broth can be prepared before the chicken broth but i usually prepare them simultaneously let them stand over night and mix and season them the next day. I also used dried noodles, many asian supermarkets offer them fresh, use those if you can get your hands on them.  Should feed 5-6 average persons or 3 hungry men  Chicken broth:  1 whole chicken (1-1,4 kg) wash it and place it in a large pot add  2 carrots washed and grated  2 leeks white part chopped up green part in whole  200-250 g parsley root peeled and grated  200-250 g black radish peeled and grated  100-150g parsnip peeled and grated  2 garlic lumps (i use solo garlic, probably equals round about 6-9 cloves) peeled and grated  1 bay leaf  3-4 branches parsley  2-3 branches rosemary  add water (i end up using around 1,5l most of the time) until everything is barely covered and boil it up. Reduce the heat put a drop lid on top and let it simmer for 2 hours. Take the chicken out and peel the meat off it, it can be eaten with the ramen itself or be used for whatever other dish you see fitting. Pour the broth through a coarse sieve and squeeze the last bit of liquid out of the cooked out veggies.  Chashu (pork belly) broth:  800 g boneless pork belly wash it saute it roll and tie it it up skin side out (my 2nd pot isnt big enough so i cant do that, if you can go for it) and place it in a pot add  3 thumbs ginger peeled and grated  6 garlic lumps (again solo garlic so roughly 18-27 cloves) peeled and grated  4 shallots  200 ml light soy sauce (if you only have dark soy sauce available use 250ml of that)  0,5 litres of a rather strong (5+% alcohol) and sweet beer (i usually use Tyskie or Augustiner Hell, i found that using beer resulted in better taste than using sake and mirin)  16 whole peppercorns  2 Tablespoons honey or maple syrup  add water until the meat is not completely covered up and boil it up reduce the heat put a drop lid on top and let it simmer for 1,5-2 hours. Turn the heat off and let it get cold over night. Take the pork belly out and slice it up as thin as possible. Pour the broth through a fine sieve and squeeze the remaining liquid out of the veggies.  Now combine both broths and add 2 Tablespoons of dark miso cook it up and season to taste with soy sauce.  Cook noodles and sear the chashu using a blowtorch or the oven grill. Add chashu and noodles to a bowl pour broth over it and season to your liking (you can use everything you like srsly), seasonings i have so far used:  Roasted nori, soft boiled/scrambled/hard boiled/fried/raw egg, sweet corn, chicken from the chicken broth, minced meat, scallions and many many more  enjoy :)"

Yume wo Katare is Japanese for ""speak your dream,"" and when you finish your ramen you have a chance to tell the customers around you about an important dream you have. As the head of the Yume wo Katare project, Tsuyoshi Nishioka says, when we talk about our dreams with others, we are able to think more deeply about what our dreams are and how to achieve them, to help keep them in mind and stay focused on what is most important in life to us:  ""To be honest, in this society, I can not say that it is easy to share our dreams out loud in public. However, I believe that by talking about our dreams, we are slowly making an environment where talking about our dreams is a regular thing to do. The dreams we talk about create the future. Please don't be shy to speak up, let's create the future together!""  It's really easy to get bogged down in the grind of work, or your classes, or whatever's stressing you out, and sort of lose energy and fall into a slump, but if you do remind yourself frequently of what you're trying to reach for, you'll find yourself grasping each step one at a time. I don't think enough people remember to keep their passions alive and remind themselves of what they care about, so I really think the sort of positive space and philosophy that Yumekata delivers with its ramen is a big deal."

ramen,34b69y,MAGICHUSTLE,0,Wed Apr 29 19:23:21 2015 UTC,"It probably depends on what you count, really. There are Japanese places that serve ramen, or places that serve all kinds of noodles. And then of course if they're actually good to eat is an entirely different story."
ramen,347dk1,Cogitaire,8,Tue Apr 28 21:55:20 2015 UTC,Congrats! You've just completed your first step into the wonderful world of ramen! It only gets better from there!
ramen,347dk1,James_Versus,9,Tue Apr 28 22:40:39 2015 UTC,"To peel the eggs easier, try placing them in freezing water immediately after boiling them for a few minutes, then peel them under lukewarm water. The shell comes right off! Here are some other things you can add: Green onions, bacon (try not to cook it too long), nori sheets, or sesame seeds! Instant ramen can be fancy without being expensive."

ramen,347dk1,HollowImage,3,Wed Apr 29 01:34:21 2015 UTC,"alternatively you can just crack your eggs into the pot as the water's boiling at minute 2, and then add 1 minute to the net taim (4 instead of 3) before you drain. you will get pached eggs and wont even worry about peeling them"
ramen,347dk1,chricke,2,Wed Apr 29 03:13:15 2015 UTC,"Also, put the eggs in when it's boiling/steaming. The heat chock creates condensation and loosens the the shell."
ramen,347dk1,dontcallmekliffy,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:26:37 2015 UTC,"Also, use a pin to create a small hole on the larger side of the egg before boiling.  This will remove the air bubble and create a perfectly shaped egg.  If you want to get really tasty, marinade them in soy sauce for a few hours after peeling them.  Here's a guide!"

ramen,345zd4,smartsushy,3,Tue Apr 28 15:56:46 2015 UTC,How was this place? They're opening up a shop in Chicago in the next few months and I am 100% hype for it. Is my hype justified?
ramen,345zd4,Ramen_Lord,3,Tue Apr 28 16:52:35 2015 UTC,"No response from op but I've been several times. Love it. Their broth was a bit weak the first month but it seems they perfected it within that time. I'm not sure if it was this specific tonkotsu black or another one they have; but it came with nori and that ultimately ruined the dish for me as all I could taste was fish. I am biased, as I'm not a fan of nori in general. Every other time I've been I've thoroughly enjoyed it due to their consistency in flavors."

Not quite on the same level as Mu Ramen or Tatsu-ya for tonkotsu, but I was really satisfied since I had a disappointing bowl at Maru Ramen in Dallas earlier the same day.

ramen,3464ur,dakchan,6,Tue Apr 28 16:37:09 2015 UTC,Tried making the ramen burger and turned out very similar to the real thing. Let me know what you guys think.
ramen,3464ur,JeremyMorel,3,Tue Apr 28 16:38:05 2015 UTC,"I'm really excited to try this.  I have not done this previously, because, as the blog suggests, I knew egg would make a custard-y texture that I wouldn't care for.  (Truth: I just don't DO eggs... Tried. Can't. Don't like the taste unless bury-baked into some sugary cake-like confection.)  This seems like a time commitment and I'll want to devote my full attention to it, so I'll report back soon.  Thanks for sharing!  Edit: punctuation"
ramen,3464ur,bc2zb,2,Wed Apr 29 03:54:19 2015 UTC,"It might seem daunting at first, but it is pretty simple. The noodles cook for only half a minute. You can make patties in 10-15 minutes. The longest thing is just slowly caramelizing the onions. The one thing that I should have done better was compress the noodles more, but it still turned out great.  Good luck! Definitely let me know how it goes!"
ramen,3464ur,Shirosynth,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:22:29 2015 UTC,"A tip for the lazy. You can caramelize onions in a slow cooker, with or without oil. Throw in your onions, and let them cook for 12 or more hours. They won't burn, but you can over caramelize them, giving them more bitter notes."
ramen,349x6o,MAGICHUSTLE,3,Wed Apr 29 13:45:25 2015 UTC,"I love chicken(torigara)-shio ramen. It's pretty common in Japan, and in many ways very recognizable to the western palate as well."
ramen,345a7c,babyblanka,3,Tue Apr 28 12:27:52 2015 UTC,"Posted a few weeks ago that I was going to San Francisco and needed some ramen, and you guys came through! Orenchi was amazing. You do need to get there early (we arrived about 30 minutes before opening) to put your name on the list. It was worth it! I wish we would have eaten more but I felt a little rushed due to the insane line outside. Pictured is the tonkotsu ramen with chasu and egg. All of it perfect! This is by far the closest bowl I've had to the ones in Japan. It's probably a good thing I do not live close by! Thank you all for the suggestion!"
ramen,345a7c,Ace-O-Matic,3,Tue Apr 28 12:29:56 2015 UTC,"I live about 5 mins from this place, can confirm I have waited in line for 50+ mins on multiple occasions."
ramen,345a7c,bombergoround,2,Tue Apr 28 17:51:24 2015 UTC,"They also have Orenchi Beyond in San Francisco proper. Easily one of the best bowls I've had in the city.  Edit: I guess they also have some other sister stores in Los Altos and Santa Clara, the Sumika Grill and Iroriya respectively."
ramen,345a7c,eo10998,2,Tue Apr 28 16:26:27 2015 UTC,"Oh yea? I missed that! Honestly though - I was so happy after this! Most of my other ramen experiences (even the ""fancy"" ones) were so disappointing. Stupid Japan trip ruined me for life :D"

The only thing my brain remembers is the long wait...  I live close by, so I guess I could go again but not when Kotetsu is nearby with a much shorter wait."
ramen,345b7q,babyblanka,3,Tue Apr 28 12:37:58 2015 UTC,"This was my second ramen stop in CA, and it was sort of a fluke since I planned on getting burgers instead :D But we went to Japantown and the ""20 hour tonkotsu"" sign in the window just called to me! It was good - definitely thicker pork which I personally don't love, but I know a lot of other people appreciate it. Less of a pork flavor in the broth, or at least compared to Orenchi (see my earlier post). Orenchi pork broth really just hit you in the face. This was more subtle but still very flavorful. Was not disappointed at either stop, though if I went back, Orenchi would be my first choice."
ramen,345b7q,bombergoround,3,Tue Apr 28 12:39:47 2015 UTC,"I've been to this place a few times. It's pretty tasty, but I'm not such a fan of the thinner-style noodles. Really fast service during lunch hour though. If you like good, thin chashu and are in Japantown; I recommend Shalala Ramen. Super thinly sliced pork that melts in your mouth. They have like a 'super chashu' bowl, but that just comes with thicker slices. Get the regular bowl and just ask for extra chashu, you won't be disappointed.  I also really like Waraku Ramen Izakaya, just around the corner from these spots, for a little bit more upscale ramen experience."
ramen,345b7q,HelloPillowbug,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:27:35 2015 UTC,"I always see Shalala Ramen right across from Yamadaya. But whenever I'm in the area, I always end up going to either Yamadaya or Waraku. How does Shalala compare to those two?"
ramen,345b7q,bombergoround,1 point,Sat May 2 15:42:58 2015 UTC,"Despite the somewhat silly name, I am a big fan. They're not as upscale as Waraku, but I, personally, prefer them over Yamadaya. They have a good broth, not quite as a many options as Yamadaya (e.g. black garlic oil, etc.) but they have the choice for thick or thin noodles (I prefer thick personally). Their regular chashu is amazing, super thinly sliced and delicious, I order extra every time I visit. They have some sort of 'extra chashu' bowl, but that's just thicker cuts, I prefer to just order extra of the thin slices. The service has always been very friendly. I definitely recommend it for a more casual meal than Waraku."

ramen,348pdl,brocktherock2018,5,Wed Apr 29 04:31:18 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend a brand switch.  There are better brand than maruchan with noodles that will be chewier/less gelatinous or undercooked.  First off, I'd recommend either some shin ramyun, or Sapporo Ichiban brands.  Second, if you toss the noodles in cold water immediately after cooking, it'll give them better texture.  Third, try adding an egg.  You can just toss it into the ramen in the last 2 minutes, and depending on how hard the water is boiling/how you add the egg, it'll show up in a bunch of different ways.  You could also make some seasoned eggs as well.  If you're looking for more things to add, you could toss in some seaweed, bamboo shoots, chopped green onions, or even throw a kraft single on top of the finished ramen.  I know the kraft thing sounds really weird, but it's actually great.  You could also consider cooking it in a different way.  You could very lightly boil the noodles, then fry them the rest of the way.  You could also cook the noodles, take them out of the water, and just add the seasonings directly.  Those are the suggestions that I can offer off the top of my head.  None of those take a particularly large amount of effort other than making seasoned eggs, and maybe frying the noodles.  I hope this was helpful."

The noodles continued to absorb the broth, which made them flavorful, but very gooey and chewy with absolutely no bite to them at all and generally not good.  The broth was...odd.  Aside from there being less of it, the taste was not as good reheated as it is when you just pull the boiling pot off the heat.  I feel like the best way to do it is find a way to cook it wherever you are, and by a decently sized tupperware container you can stuff all your ingredients in so they are all in the same spot.  Cook the ramen and dump everything in right after it's cooked.  The tl;dr I guess is I reheated ramen once and would never imagine doing it again."

I usually make ramen two bricks at a time.   Stack bricks in bowl. Dump the seasoning packets at the short sides of the bricks. Fill with cold water until the level is just short of covering the bottom brick. Get two eggs. Crack one in each of the of the spaces on the long sides of the bricks. Pour a small pile of your preferred frozen veggie mix on the top brick. Microwave on high for 4 minutes. Remove. Push veggies into the water. Use a fork to flip bricks so the top brick is now on the bottom. Microwave on high for 2 minutes 30 seconds. Remove. Use fork or chopsticks to separate noodles.  I'm not a big fan of ramen broth. I drain the liquid at this point, but that's just me. I use a combination of sesame oil, rice vinegar, teriyaki sauce, sriracha, sweet and sour sauce, and sunflower seeds to top noodle. Mix well and enjoy."

ramen,33o6t3,jumbowumbo,2,Fri Apr 24 05:47:24 2015 UTC,Pikaichi's alright but personally I prefer Yume Wo Katare better. It's a bit less traditional but still authentic. If the Santouka's like any other Santouka I've been to I'd take that over Pikaichi as well.

ramen,33o6t3,jumbowumbo,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:13:19 2015 UTC,"Yume wo Katare has a sister restaurant in Japan as well, calling Santouka an actual ramne chain doesn't seem to mean much. In fact, that Santouka is more of a chain is disappointing compared to smaller restaurant businesses like Yume and its Japanese sister.  The culture of the restaurant is extremely important, and Santouka is very chic and upscale and modern. There is a wait staff that serves you water from a swingtop chilled bottle, takes your order, serves you bowls on platters, and plays contemporary jazz. It is very restaurant-y, and the atmosphere, while aesthetically interesting, is mostly cold and boring compared to Yume.   Yume, meanwhile, has only 2 menu items that differ based on size, is just one joint, with a friendly and inviting atmosphere, an interesting dream-based competitive aspect, and truly excellent homemade ramen.  The noodles at Santouka are pretty terrible relatively. I've been buying frozen dried ramen from a local store for a few years now, and the noodles at Santouka are exactly the same. The noodles are fine but they're not even close to something handmade by a local restaurant. Yume's pork, tare, noodles, even aromatics all exceed Santouka, and this is not even considering the restaurant's atmosphere and its authentic joint feel compared to Santouka's corporate tryhard-ness."
ramen,33o6t3,bli,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:53:35 2015 UTC,"You haven't been to other Santoukas clearly. Most Santoukas are in Mitsuwa food courts and are almost never stand alone like the Cambridge location. So I find it hilarious that you're claiming their Cambridge location as the 'culture' of their franchise when it is not representative of the vast majority of their American locations.  In terms of broth, I find Santouka much better. The tare at Yume is too salty and overpowers any pork flavors present. Their broth is unapologetically fatty, which is fine, but I find that it lacks the depth of flavor of Santouka. The Yume broth simply has no subtleties of flavor and is overwhelmed by the tare. I could not drink it at all. I much prefer Santouka's creamy porky broth, especially with their shio tare (what they're known for).  The toppings are possibly in Yume's favor but the toroniku at Santouka is quite good as well. More of a tossup in my opinion.  The noodles at Yume are homemade, sure. But I find them too thick and too similar to a Chinese sliced noodle rather than a Japanese ramen noodle. I don't think they do a particularly good job and don't think their noodles are any better than Santouka's. I quite dislike Yume's noodle style, but I generally prefer more of a Hakata style ramen.  Your arguments against Santouka have little to do with what's in the bowl, but rather consist of a misguided tirade against their corporate culture, despite clearly having never visited another Santouka location in your life. You're fine to have your opinion, and I'm perfectly fine disagreeing with you. I've been to Yume wo Katare twice, and have not been impressed either time."

We followed the Cooking With Dog recipe on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfEUwNQTXwU&spfreload=10  The ingredients copied straight from the video are:  Ingredients for Yakibuta Ramen (serves 2)   Yakibuta Roasted Pork - 500g Pork Belly (1.1 lb) Green part of Long Green Onion 1 Small piece of Ginger Root 4 tbsp Soy Sauce 2 tbsp Sake 1 tbsp Brown or Regular Sugar Reduce the pork rib broth to 300ml (1¼ cups). Seasoned Eggs - 2 Large Eggs (65~70g / 2¼~2½ oz) 1 tbsp Soy Sauce 1 tbsp Sake 1 tbsp Mirin Toppings - 12cm White part of Long Green Onion (4¾ inches)  80g Spinach (2.8 oz) Narutomaki - a type of Steamed Fish Cake Menma - a condiment made from Fermented Bamboo Shoots Toasted Nori Seaweed Dashi Stock - 1200ml Water (5.1 u.s. cups) 10g Niboshi - Dried Baby Sardines (0.35 oz) 10x5cm Dried Kombu Kelp (4x2 inches)   2 bags of Fresh Ramen Noodles 2 tsp Chicken Stock Powder  We were a bit disappointed in the flavor of the ramen at the end since our soup wasn't as flavorful as we had hoped. The dashi stock really didn't have much flavor and merely diluted the pork broth. The eggs came out really well and Sun fresh ramen noodles are very chewy and tasty. There's a lot of areas for improvement and this is still a pretty basic ramen recipe. Thanks for looking!"

ramen,33ftfy,Aescholus,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:56:57 2015 UTC,"The crowd, while not quite ""energetic"", gave constant attention and flooded me with tons of questions and even some advise. A few residents had been to/lived in/came from Japan and had much to tell me of their time and experience.  Tonkotsu was prepared as you would expect: Soaked, washed, blanched, rinsed, boiled about ten pounds of miscellaneous pork bones I had tucked in the freezer. Low boil, partially covered 20 or so hours, with a two hour rapid boil at the community center to emulsify. Mixed aromatics, tried an apple this time to see what's the deal. I had a stash of shoyu taré in the freeze as well."

ramen,33dmrf,sebbysir,6,Tue Apr 21 17:51:34 2015 UTC,"Does Sun Ramen count? It comes as a semi-dry frozen / fresh product that is made in exactly the same way as dried stuff. They even come with flavours of soup just like dried stuff.  Sun Ramen (if it counts) is by far the #1 for me. I have yet to find one I haven't loved. I've tried:   Miso Spicy Miso Tantan Chuka (cold) Shoyu   And I have heard that their tonkotsu was phenomenal.  If not then, I like the instant ramen from Nissin:   ""The Red Pack"" - shoyu flavoured. ""The Green Pack"" - tonkotsu sesame flavoured.   and finally, the one that has been toted to be the best dried since ever: Prima Taste Laksa. This ramen has a rich flavour (second only to Sun ramen) and excellent chewiness to the noodles. Easily 2-3x the cost of a normal ramen."

ramen,33dmrf,grainzzz,1 point,Thu Apr 23 00:42:25 2015 UTC,"Use 10.5fl oz of water to guarantee great flavour. It also helps to undercook the noodles just a little and let them sit in the soup for a minute or two before enjoying them.  Like I said, every day."

ramen,3389mn,orksnork,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:22:54 2015 UTC,I just used the recipe from David Chang's cookbook. He has a simmer for 6-7 hours. You prefer it the way you described though?

ramen,336bz0,GayNiggerInSpace,3,Sun Apr 19 23:28:20 2015 UTC,"I just had shin black for the first time. If you can handle a bit of spice it is awesome. Even if you can't do spicy you can be a bit light on the flavor packet. I recently got these noodles in a green long package the only English on them is ""noodles with Jan Jan sauce"" or something along those lines. It is gross. Some may like it, but I would personally avoid it. What I have been liking is buying noodles alone and then adding soup base, sesame oil, rice vinegar, soy sauce and some bacon bits and an egg. This is extremely easy to make, but it does take two pots because the noodles make the water starchy, although you can soft boil the egg and then throw the noodles in the same pot when it finishes. For noodles you can get a wide variety so I would recommend getting some of the small packages that have only one to three servings and see what kind you prefer.    Just my 2 cents, but keep mind that I am still a ramen noob myself."
ramen,336bz0,TheRowboatMassacre,2,Mon Apr 20 02:51:26 2015 UTC,"I actually prefer spicy, thanks for the reply stranger!"
ramen,336bz0,TheRowboatMassacre,2,Mon Apr 20 03:00:21 2015 UTC,"You are very welcome for the reply stranger!  If you like spicy, I haven't tried it, but I know people really like a simple ramen with just a heap of kimchi on top. I personally prefer to add meat and have a spicier broth if I want spicy. Something I forgot in my last post is that bullion is awesome for when you use your noodles that don't have flavoring, but don't have time for a broth that will take all day(literally) to make and don't want to tare into your other packages and leave them without flavoring. Also, if you use it with some green onions and mushrooms and a spicy ingredient of your choice, it is easily better than a lot of the stuff in the cheaper ramen anyways. For spicy stuff try sriracha or even those red pepper flakes you put on pizza, both add spice. Of course if you love hot stuff you can experiment with any other chilis/hot sauce/otherstuff  that you might have. Hate fun and enjoy your ramen!"

ramen,32in24,KalsyWalsy,4,Tue Apr 14 02:21:51 2015 UTC,"I would say probably not.  IMO, at the most basic level, there's 3 different ways to make broth.  Below boiling, a gentle simmer, and rolling boil.  Then there are other variables such as time, bones used, additional veg, fat skimming, etc.  It really depends on what you're looking to produce."
ramen,32in24,OiScout,2,Tue Apr 14 05:01:13 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend looking at the sidebar for some recipes I've developed (shameless plug, I know...). Most recipes online are not tested, inaccurate, or worse, full of misinformation about ramen. (How many tonkotsu recipes have you seen online that look brown? and watery?)  The problem is that ramen is about style, and with that comes so many iterations that there isn't really one ""master"" recipe. There are basic techniques, but things like when the bones and vegetables are added, the cooking time, the water to ingredient ratios, the batches, and virtually any variable in the process, can change over time. Learning about style involves knowing what characteristics each style showcases, and how to master those characteristics.   For instance, for Tonkotsu style broths, you need high heat, lots of fat, agitation, and gelatin, with few to no aromatics. For lighter broths, you generally want the opposite.   There's also the issue of ""tare,"" the flavorful base that seasons the broth. Is your resulting soup showcasing tare? Broth? Both? All of this ultimately defines how you make your personal ramen bowl.  What I would recommend is starting simple, with existing styles. Those are the recipes I try to develop at home. Look at the shoyu ramen recipe to the right as a good starting point. It's light, clean, chicken-y, approachable but relatively easy to do at home.

ramen,32ecut,awhitf20,4,Mon Apr 13 02:29:03 2015 UTC,"Aside from ""don't cook the egg/udon as long,"" I can't give you much constructive criticism.   As a former cook, however, the presentation could use some color. Greens from fresh cut green onions and nori (or whatever they use in Japan - I live in Korea) catch the eye and make ramen look so much better. Lots of people seem to put in corn for a nice, bright yellow. I don't know how authentic you want to make yours.  Also, for presentation, use a kitchen towel and firmly wipe along the inside of the rim before you serve. It kinda looks like you just dumped your soup in and it splattered everywhere before you took a picture. I'm sure it was pretty delicious. It just doesn't look appetizing this way."

Again, sorry this isn't helping you!  Have you had a look at Ramen_Lord's tonkotsu recipe? http://www.reddit.com/r/ramen/comments/2l2eas/here_it_is_the_granddaddy_of_them_all_homemade_18/ Perhaps you can go through that and see if it looks like what you're after."
ramen,3286gp,blopdt,5,Sat Apr 11 13:25:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link, I hadn't seen it!  The trip to Japan was for me, amazing. I could talk for hours about it (feel free to PM me if you want any other info/details/etc), but in short I spent a month in Tokyo, a week in Osaka, a week in Kyoto, a 4 or 5 days on a small island near Hiroshima, and then some time (a week or so?) in a small town called Uno.  I am traveling with my wife, which changes the financial stuff a bit, but for what it's worth I thought that Japan was a lot less expensive then I expected. Of course lots of this comes down to your requirements/spending habits. For us, shopping at grocery stores for roughly half of our meals, and eating out mainly at ramen (hence this post!) and conveyer belt sushi places (i.e. we didn't go out to a lot of fancy dinners or eat at super nice sushi restaurants), drinking beer/sake/etc from grocery stores, and doing mainly free or cheap tours/activities (we did a lot of stuff on meetup.com, couchsurfing communities, etc) - all of these things helped to keep our trip fairly cheap.  We also took buses almost exclusively to travel in between cities, and there are a number of pretty good deals that can be had with various bus companies.  In Tokyo we found a really good deal on AirBnB for a shared apartment (we ended up sleeping in the kitchen of some girls apartment for a month, which was sometimes rough, but honestly not bad and the girl was super nice and overall it was a great experience) for something like 400 bucks for a month (cheap!).   I think Japan could be done for a single person for around $50 bucks a day, including room in a hostel and transportation if you moved once a week or so, assuming you did as we did and cut out some of the more costly expenses like nicer restaurants, bars/clubs (except rarely), and stuck with free or near free activities (which there are a ton). Going into certain temples/gardens/etc can add up also, but if you are strict about your budget I think $50 a day would be quite reasonable, perhaps even closer to $40 USD per day.   Let me know if you have any specific questions (and I have a few blog posts I wrote if you are currious: mainly from November (http://www.shoelessone.com/2014/11/) and December (http://www.shoelessone.com/2014/12/))"

ramen,3286gp,mudokipo,1 point,Sun Apr 12 21:41:18 2015 UTC,How Can The Broth Be Flavorful  If The Tare Has All The Flavor
ramen,3286gp,ltran96,3,Mon Apr 13 18:50:30 2015 UTC,"Here are a few tips:  If you want a super creamy tonkatsu, boil pork bones (neck bones are the best, rib bones are the worst) at a rolling boil and add water every hour for 8 hours. It's easiest to boil the tonkatsu broth separately from everything else and add it to the ramen in the end, but that's up to you. If you want more flavor and less cream, roast the bones for 30 minutes before you boil.  Chicken neck, thigh, feet, and wing bones work well with tonkatsu broth. I'm assuming you don't want it super chicken-y, so just don't add chicken fat, break open bones so the marrow is exposed and boil for an hour or 2.  If you do use fish, use dried fish that doesn't taste very bitter. OR boil fish bones for an hour or two.  That salty flavor comes mostly from the tare. Try a butter and miso combination if you want rich flavor with little effort."
ramen,3286gp,icanhazbudget,2,Sat Apr 11 17:28:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this, especially the info re: the tare. I've looked into it a bit more since this post and tare seems like a great idea for me to make sure I have when I sere the ramen. Thanks again!"

I will definitely check out tahini and the blackened garlic oil at my local Asian store. Do you make the garlic oil yourself or buy it ready made?

We normally make around eight eggs in a batch, which holds is through the week. But if you're just marinating one for yourself or taking one to work, the mini mason jar idea you posted is perfect!

ramen,31bbtg,Ramen_Lord,3,Fri Apr 3 15:07:27 2015 UTC,Is this something you add separately to the bowl with the tare?  Or do you keep it simmering in the broth/stock?    I'll check out the recipes on the sidebar for sure.
ramen,31bbtg,Ramen_Lord,3,Fri Apr 3 18:28:22 2015 UTC,"Aroma oil is generally added separately, usually to the bottom of the bowl with the tare prior to ladling on more stock.

ramen,319ssz,Telesis,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:02:10 2015 UTC,"Sure thing. I'm no Ramen expert but I'll share my thoughts. I actually went to Orenchi the previous night and Orenchi Beyond in SF the day before that so 3 days in a row of ramen. All three places were excellent. Ramen Yamadaya is pretty great. It's kind've like a Ramen shack, very nondescript and unassuming.   I ordered the Tonkotsu Kotteri with chili sauce, fresh garlic and kakuni pork belly topping. The broth itself is an extra rich style, fatty broth. It definitely delivers in that category, it's almost a bit too much so be warned. For the garlic they bring you a couple of cloves of raw, fresh garlic and a garlic press which I thought was pretty cool. The pork belly is a huge slab of delicately rendered belly (roasted I think) that you can break up into chunks and add to the soup. Together with the rich broth this is some heavy, fatty stuff, quite delicious. The noodles were soft and thin, again not an expert so not sure what they're supposed to be exactly but they seemed to do their job. If I had to do again I might try the regular Tonkotsu or the Tonkotsu spicy. Either way a great bowl of ramen and perhaps my favorite of the three bowls I had over the three days."
ramen,319ssz,Telesis,1 point,Fri Apr 3 19:02:02 2015 UTC,Thanks man! I haven't been to Orenchi SF yet but I heard it's not as good as the original. I'll put this place on my Try list!
ramen,319ssz,Telesis,1 point,Fri Apr 3 19:11:00 2015 UTC,"Orenchi Beyond is good but it's got a lot of hype around it so probably not worth the line. If you can go on off hours when there's no wait I'd recommend it. Yamadaya has an SF location, haven't been but heard good reports and it's probably not as crowded as Orenchi. Both south bay locations seemed more authentic than their SF counterparts and were very good."

ramen,31479t,je-june,1 point,Thu Apr 2 00:50:48 2015 UTC,Lol I believe it. Tasty though 👍
ramen,31479t,Doeadeerohdear,0,Thu Apr 2 01:10:19 2015 UTC,"So, it's pork cheek? Is that just a large strip of fat? I'm curious what it tastes like, usually eating pure fat eeeeks me."
ramen,31479t,neska00,1 point,Thu Apr 2 08:50:51 2015 UTC,Immense amount of fat with just a little bit of meat at the bottom. Delicious. Most animal fat kind of makes me feel sick but this stuff is pure porky gold.
ramen,31479t,H3M4D,1 point,Thu Apr 2 13:34:31 2015 UTC,I haven't been there yet on a Wednesday but people keep telling me I need to! Looks good!
ramen,31479t,H3M4D,1 point,Wed Apr 1 22:36:23 2015 UTC,"Come on out, it's awesome! Hit up Basan for lunch, too!"
ramen,31479t,beanieb,1 point,Thu Apr 2 01:10:01 2015 UTC,how would you compare this to Dashi? Both in price and quality? I've yet to get to Rose's for this.
ramen,31479t,lavendercandy,2,Wed Apr 1 23:35:34 2015 UTC,"I've heard Dashi sucks, and honestly, I wouldn't wanna pay $18 for a bowl of ramen. This was $12 and pretty awesome. You can also find pretty decent ramen at Basan, $12 at lunch for a gigantic bowl 👍"
ramen,31479t,quixotic_confidence,1 point,Thu Apr 2 01:09:27 2015 UTC,"ah I'll have to try Basan. sounds like a good deal.   And may I urge you to try dashi. It's actually $14 a bowl and they are substantial despite what I keep hearing. I really enjoyed the tonkatsu bowl and see no need for the extra additions (they make the meal considerably more expensive and the bowl comes with a ton of additions already). the only thing I don't like about that specific bowl is the addition of ginger. that's a personal preference, though.   it's definitely not the best value, but for every now and then, I think it's fine. hopefully it stirs up another entrepreneur willing to start up a more affordable ramen shop.   Dashi really shines in there upstairs izakaya. good beer, amazing small plates (not overly expensive), and the atmosphere is great. again, not a place to get cheap specials, but affordable enough for a nice night out from time to time."

ramen,31561t,tkwee,3,Thu Apr 2 02:00:18 2015 UTC,"Just tried my hand at making a chicken broth ramen, and was aiming for something similar to Marutama's chicken ramen. I used chicken feet, wings, and a carcass - and the broth gelled up nicely when refrigerated. Unfortunately, didnt turn out quite as thick as the ones in the ramen shops.   Was also wondering what tare is used for chicken ramen, and if it is similar to a tonkotsu broth. I used dashi stock, salt, mirin, and a touch of soy sauce. My broth was started off with chicken, adding aromatics (onion, ginger, garlic) the last hour or so of the process, all in all cooked the stock at a rolling boil for about 5 hours. Thanks for any tips!"
ramen,31561t,Ramen_Lord,3,Thu Apr 2 02:07:03 2015 UTC,"Overall, looks pretty nice! Just ideas here, by no means the be all end all:   I might consider using a lighter tare next go around, possibly without the soy sauce if you're looking for lighter color. I'd also reduce the water volume next time, which will increase the gelatin ratio to liquid and thus give you more body. You could, of course, also boil the stock further to drive off some of that water content.  Did you blanch/soak the chicken parts at all? It might help with the color if you didn't."
ramen,31561t,Ramen_Lord,2,Thu Apr 2 02:17:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks /u/ramen_lord! I used your fresh noodle recipe too, and it turned out great! I still have a batch of broth in the fridge and will try reducing it some more. Also going to try another tare as per your suggestion!"
ramen,31561t,dillpunk,3,Thu Apr 2 14:12:27 2015 UTC,"Care to tell us about your process? Hard to diagnose any issues (if they even exist!) without some background!   edit: just saw your post now, will respond shortly!"
ramen,31561t,Lagniprimatte,3,Thu Apr 2 02:05:08 2015 UTC,"A while back I cloned tenkaippins kotteri ramen, arguably the king of kotteri chicken based ramen in Japan. Here is a recipe / pictures. Different than what you made but it is my favorite ramen in Japan and the recipe came out great.   http://m.imgur.com/a/yePuf"
ramen,31561t,dillpunk,2,Thu Apr 2 12:22:47 2015 UTC,"Wow! that's quite a process you've got there. I haven't thought about blending the chicken and veg but it makes sense - after all we do it to other european/american inspired soups too. Will experiment, thanks!"

ramen,3155i8,cdmove,2,Thu Apr 2 01:56:18 2015 UTC,"Lots of questions! Here we go!   is it healthy to eat a bowl everyday?   Probably not lol. Ramen is junk food, full of fat and sodium and carbs. I'm sure you're fine in the short term, just don't make this an ""every day for years"" thing haha.    what other cut of pork can I use beside pork belly to make chasu pork?   Common cuts include the shoulder (which I did about a month ago for a chicken shio ramen I'm developing and it was killer), and the loin. You'd treat the shoulder much as you would belly, low and slow in a braise. I took the area furthest from the bone (the section that includes the ""money muscle"" and the ""tubes,"" as BBQers call them), the area with more veins of fat, but both sections will work. The loin needs to be cooked much more rapidly, just to temp. Both should be chilled thoroughly before slicing, much like belly.    how come my broth doesn't look white/cloudy like most pictures of tonkotsu?   Can you tell us about how you prepared the broth? That usually indicates why the color is darker."
ramen,3155i8,Ramen_Lord,2,Thu Apr 2 02:14:38 2015 UTC,"I followed your method actually. The broth is in its solid form right now in the fridge and there's a thick white layer (~3/8"" thick) of fat? on top and the broth below that. When I go to reheat the thing, I try to scoop straight down so I'd get a nice a mount of fat and broth but I guess it's not enough.  I'm not sure where I did wrong..."
ramen,3155i8,Ramen_Lord,1 point,Thu Apr 2 02:51:09 2015 UTC,"Did you soak/blanch the bones? Did you try to stir it frequently? Was the broth cooking on high heat with a nice rapid boil? Did anything scorch on the bottom of the pot? How long did you cook it for? When did you add aromatics (if at all)?  It's hard to say without specifics unfortunately, and slight changes in the method can greatly alter results!"

ramen,311pxh,platinumchef,1 point,Wed Apr 1 12:15:57 2015 UTC,they were never good. guy has a huge ego for having such shitty ramen. no idea how his ramen cost so much -and- wasn't making a profit. the investors made the right decision.
