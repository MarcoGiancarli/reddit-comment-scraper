Tribes,3doq2m,Samuel1415,9,Sat Jul 18 01:06:29 2015 UTC,"Might have something for you people, maybe. Try and change your game directory to steamapps/common using DiagandServices.exe wherever you placed the Hi-Rez services. The Hi-Rez launcher will load instead of the normal Tribes launcher through Steam, but it'll let you login, and should recognise your current install instead of re-downloading. Keeps overlay, too.  tl;dr use new Hi-Rez launcher and just set your installation path manually. It may need you to re-install the services. There's probably a better way to do this, but it's 2:30am, and I suck."

Tribes,3doq2m,Samuel1415,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:21:23 2015 UTC,"Incase you're still having any trouble:  If your ""games"" folder for Hi-Rez is at your steamapps/common, you should be able to login through the blue Hi-Rez launcher shown when you launch Tribes through Steam - and you shouldn't need to re-download any content. The executable I mentioned is found, by default (unless you've moved it during a reinstallation), in Program Files (x86)/Hi-Rez Studios, on the same drive as your Steam installation. Making sure the ""Default Games Directory"" is set to your Steam's common folder (with nothing further on the end after that path) through the ""HiRezGamesDiagAndSupport"" executable should have the above effect, and let you keep Steam overlay and shiz."

Tribes,3di7ss,Ensiss,12,Thu Jul 16 14:03:31 2015 UTC,"Ensis seems to be gone so I couldn't tell him to correct the post.  It's not really possible to have a sound played for every accolade with this release, only a select few which I thought are the most important/common ones. Theoretically it's easy to add a sound for every single one but that would mean so many variables because every accolade would get a volume and an enable/disable toggle. If you think a certain one is really needed, let me know and I might add it. Be reasonable though, I'm not going to add i.e. generhater because you want it to make a fart noise.  If you have good sounds for the flag events (or anything really), please share so we can ship them with the config tool (it already ships with a nice selection of q3/t1/ut99/other games sounds).  Also the current implementation of how sounds are being played is completely separate from the game. If you alt-tab out for example, the game goes mute but it will still play custom sounds. If somebody is really annoyed by that, let me know and I will see if I can fix it.  Another problem is sounds overlapping, especially in regards to accolades. I didn't want to have some sort of sound queue because that could mean processing the sound queue could take quite a bit if you gain a lot of accolades at the same time. Right now it's easy to overlap double kill with sprees, headshot etc. but it isn't too bad I think.  Edit: Also you guys should try /lua modifySoundRe(""vgs"", 1.4, 1.0) or /lua modifySoundRe(""vgs"", 0.8, 1.0) for chipmunk or monster VGS. That command can also be used to mute certain VGS commands or whole voice packs. The possibilities are endless."

Tribes,3dechq,Troutsicle,3,Wed Jul 15 19:48:57 2015 UTC,"Don't know what it is to be honest. It seem to be the new launcher they're working on currently to get rid of the old one and have it all under one launcher in general. Right now when I log in through this launcher, I don't need to login once the game starts up, it takes me straight too the actual game menu. More info on it can be found here though, HiRezKaostic said small selection from there player base was chosen, I was one of the unfortunate ones chose to test it.  http://forums.smitegame.com/showthread.php?81100-New-Hi-Rez-Launcher-Feedback"
Tribes,3dechq,SJ0,2,Wed Jul 15 19:59:31 2015 UTC,"No, I didn't see any option or a way to revert it back to the old launcher and it runs off the same HiRezLauncherUI.exe file where the game starts. The only issue I've come across is when the game would crash right after I entered my logon information. I found out why it was crashing and it was because my shortcut was manually created straight from the game directory since back then. The actual shortcut wasn't being created in one of the updates of tribes and it got annoying, always going into the folder to start the game. Since this new launcher came out, I assume a lot of people are going to have the same exact issue if not new ones and there really isn't any Tribes support for us to help fix this. Simply just add:  game=200 product=10    after the HiRezLauncherUI.exe"" in the target line of your shortcut icon otherwise the game would kick out a Command Line error: (-1) and game crashes when you attempt to logon into the new tribes launcher itself."

Tribes,3dc7b3,Urtiza,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:13:45 2015 UTC,I can pm you my paypal and what do you mean by clan wars?   A tournament with proper teams that lasts over a few months would almost certainly not end(well).
Tribes,3dc7b3,Urtiza,3,Thu Jul 16 20:39:39 2015 UTC,"I joined T:A in August 2012 and I was recruited by [IWIN] but we never got to play anybody as a clan because everyone left ( and we didn't have enough T.T). Frankly I didn't get the chance to fight along side teammates that carried the same Tag as me. I guess what I'm asking is for that scene to comeback. I'm not sure how it's set up. Or if there are any teams left to fight, and I know my teammates have disappeared :(.   So what I was going to suggest is for people, on their own, to start making teams and start applying the tags. Teams made up of the current active players. Instead of having to choose teams on the spot. All of this for the NA Draft. I think this way people will be more enthusiastic about playing/showing up. If anyone has the power to do this is you guys making the drafts happen.  P.s. Yes please pm me your PayPal I want to add to the prize money :)."
Tribes,3dc7b3,Urtiza,2,Thu Jul 16 21:01:11 2015 UTC,"As much as I'd love to have another tournament with teams, it wouldn't be viable for a number of reasons.    Not enough teams, I think that kOut would be the only team left in NA that could get a reliable 7 players together. LPC/TXM/FHS might be able to, but then again no scrim gg A new team is going to have a horrible disadvantage in both skill level, and practice. The two teams I listed earlier take up the vast majority of the talent in NA (except prettzl who is dabes ofc), and kOut has been playing together for a long time. Both of which means that a new team is going to get rekt, buttmad, and rage quit, which leads me to my third point: People in this community are flaky as fuck. Its hard enough to get people to show up for two days in a row, and getting people to show up week after week is so much harder. Especially during the summer, when people go on vacations and such. There's always a lot of hype for a new season when it just starts, but after a few weeks it becomes much harder to reach people, and matches stop happening. Maybe a much larger prize pool would help with that, but I doubt it.   A longer term draft would help alleviate the first two problems, but I think that the third would still make it likely to fail."
Tribes,3dc7b3,tehredneck,4,Thu Jul 16 21:16:21 2015 UTC,"Well.. then its decided, I will recruit for [IWIN] and get a team going. It seems like my only option is to challenge clans. Hopefully I can prove you wrong that a new team will get rekt XD."
Tribes,3dc7b3,beerrun1,6,Thu Jul 16 23:07:56 2015 UTC,"I'm all for that but as Lazy said the team meta days with tags, scrims tourney's and seasons are over. The last season we had failed miserably and didn't even finish. Honestly it just lost it's luster. All the pro teams moved on or just stopped caring enough to participate on a regular basis. (The skeletons of what teams were left consisted of house league level merges to fill roster spots.) All we have left are these community run, sponsored and organized draft events. (APC always does whatever he can to help or contribute to the best of his abilities)  Props for the initiative Urtiza and by no means do I intend on detouring you from your efforts. I think many of us would love to see a strong community again. Unfortunately the strength and longevity of Tribes Ascend was very short. Tribers will always Tribe, but until Ascend is completed or another Tribes version is created/released we are among only a shadow of what was and or could have been.    I really miss what this community used to be. <3"
Tribes,3dc7b3,beerrun1,3,Fri Jul 17 01:40:22 2015 UTC,"It probably can't be the way it was, but it can be the way it is. I hope urtiza follows through and pulls together a group willing to play, win or lose. Followed by others willing to put in the time and effort to field a consistent team. Every journey... first step... blah, blah...  btw, thanks for YOUR contributions to this little corner of the internet."

The competitive community is stagnating because fuck-all is being done to keep anyone's interest except the occasional draft, and EU is NAs canary in the coal mine.   Drafts are going to keep getting smaller and kOut is going to turn into the mentally handicapped bilgewater from tribalwar but for T:A, reminiscing about the good old days when they were the best team ever, who already circlejerk each other and lord their control over the servers and rulesets over the general population like a know-nothing middle manager in a beaurocracy who was allowed to control pen distribution and acts like he's fucking king shit of turd island when he's really just fart the messenger boy.   And instead of using the ""power"" for any good like creating captains from the remaining ""pro"" players (puhlease my fucking sides) for long running teams that practice together every week and put together an actual comp season, they upvote each other's retarded jokes on reddit without attempting to put in any effort, happily content to be the glue-eating captain of a sinking rowboat while everyone else is trying to help.

Tribes,3dc7b3,vermice1li,2,Sun Jul 19 19:21:02 2015 UTC,"Lol honestly, what do you expect lazy to do?  You're basically berating him for not single-handedly saving tribes when it was destined to die a slow and painful death by hirez.  Creating ""captains"" from the remaining former comp players is a terrible idea; not only because they would basically have to recruit out of pubs to fill their rosters, but also because whichever team had the most former comp/experienced players would have a massive advantage over any other team.  Additionally, there is no motivation for these magical teams that would apparently materialize out of nowhere to actually try to win, because there's no prize.  We could probably get gold, but that makes it literally no different from a draft.  What we're doing now is probably the best option for the current state of the NA organized tribes community.  It allows people to play in a competitive setting every so often without having to play a (very) dead game constantly against teams recruited out of pubs.  Trying to create some kind of risen-from-the-dead comp scene from the smouldering remains of the NA community would only cause more sadness as people realized just how small and disinterested the community is.  Let tribes die as honorable and painless a death as hirez will let it.  This game doesn't deserve to be put on life support and have to suffer any longer :(  edit: grammar nazi stuff"
Tribes,3dc7b3,zombieofthepast,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:05:11 2015 UTC,"So, what you're saying is that people have a problem losing. That's why no one plays this game on a comp level anymore?

Tribes,3dc7b3,Theheartattack,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:04:59 2015 UTC,"I am being serious.  And here you go.  And if you want a serious answer then here.  Look at how season 5 ended, people didn't show up, they lost interest after a few weeks. You think that adding me to that team is going to help them stay together, or to show up? That's why we're not going to have another season. People wont dedicate the time to it. I would love to be able to scrim with a team, draft or not, but it can't/wont happen so I'm going to have to deal with that, and so should you and everyone else.  So we're left with pugs/drafts for any sort of organized games. Which is what we've been doing. And if you want more balanced drafts then I'll start being more picky with captains.  I'm not sure how you want to change the rules, we've tried them in pugs, and it's been bad, so we go back. Sure, maybe there's some holy grail out there that would bring the game back, however unlikely that is. And while we're doing that people are leaving pugs because they don't like the rule changes, because they're bad.  You want to try and help? Sure try and help. I played in some of the blitz pugs, and from what I understood there were mixed feelings about them. But if you think it would help them feel free to host more. And what else has you or anyone else done outside of Red, for this community recently?  So stop being a blurry eyed idealist and either realize like your idol that this game is long dead and leave it, or stick around like the rest of us and enjoy the game the most we can."

AU has organised games but not much public server activity, and anywhere else you're out of luck. To some extent, the people who are left are dedicated... but that doesn't mean they're any good. 95% of people you'll meet in public servers are bad. It will take you a while to not get your ass handed to you if you haven't played in a long time. Not too much; servers still exist. Basically the game is in the same state it was two years ago, with the same bugs and the same issues."

If you're talking about public games, you don't have to worry. Most public players are still quite bad, so unless you run into an actual pro you'll be fine. PUGs are also still happening. The only real problem is that the game is somewhat stale now, with no changes happening anymore. However it's not really something that causes the game to ""suffer"" that much. Mostly you won't notice that Hi-Rez abandoned the game."

Tribes,3da72f,Luka666,2,Wed Jul 15 09:20:49 2015 UTC,Here's my positive review and why I changed my vote on the video to an up vote now.  It looks really beautiful really nice aesthetically. Not competitive like I'd want a future e-sport Tribe game but pretty. And the music was nice and it was edited well very clean. Nice job.  And the routes were fast and cool and that reminded me of T1.  But then I remembered that you can't adapt those routes to mistakes and retain speed and that it's really rigid in gameplay which is opposite to what I like about T1 where I'm free to improvise after mistakes or someone blasting me and still go really really really fast and that's why I initially down voted and wrote the comment I did the game play of the game just isn't as good as I'd expect a Tribes game to be after T1 but no doubt it's good and fun because it is a Tribes game. It can just get so much better though and I really wish people would experience that.

Tribes,3da72f,Luka666,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:37:42 2015 UTC,give me an example because your definition of adapting is probably much different than mine as t:a plays 100x slower than t1

Tribes,3da72f,PPWGSCTPSGC4637,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:25:46 2015 UTC,"Cappers can extend or shorten their routes based on what is going on (cut regen, need e-grab, late offence...)"
Tribes,3da72f,sheepieee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:39:45 2015 UTC,yep i agree there's a small amount of timing to an extent. but how many plays need e-grabs or llamas or short routes in top comp and how fast do those short routes and llamas feel? how good does chasing those llamas feel?  from what ive obs'd of the 30-40 games ive watched of t:a vods over the years that is about as high/hard as the game play gets  to me personally these routes still are slow and they only happen rarely. when they do happen they arent clutch. vs t1 LT which is a llama based game where u end up with 70-80 kills as chaser sometimes and its played 5v5.  you dont have to believe me but i'd just say watch a vod like this and compare it to a t:a vod  this guy is on a pro dirty bomb team with tailspin now (talespin? idk how to spell it) but he never played T;a and kept playing t1. there are many other ppl at this guys skill level from t1 LT who only played t1 LT  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ssQeeYouM8  if you are capable of watching anything outside of your little t:a only bubble  which game has more demand for fast gameplay and clutchness constantly   its pretty obvious it's t1 LT. you simply wont see that stuff in a t:a vod.

Tribes,3da72f,Achus619,-13,Wed Jul 15 03:18:24 2015 UTC,y0 when you gotta cut your videos to not show the start of the route.  i.e. you walking and flying for 5 minutes to get to the top of the big hill where your clips start. you are playing a shit tribes game.  a real tribes route you start from a dead stop typically right where you spawn and gain speed without all of these concussion grenades and disc jumps those are just bonus for even more speed.  perhaps consider not punishing yourself anymore and play a real tribes game that wasnt designed solely to get hirez todd and erez more rich than they already are because it seems you really enjoy skiing and i dont think you should have to rely on running face first into a rock just to get speed and feel good and have fun   this also goes for the people adding fast forward into their montage kill videos like what the fuck.

Also they don't really like this sub, as it's ""tribes"" but we mostly talk about Ascend (weird uh?), so they basically come here and piss all over the place to reclaim their territory. There is no logic behind it, it's just a dark and old recess of the internet with its own rules that refuses to close down, like /b/ or somethingawful, and sometimes the trolls come out and want to play.

Tribes,3d4tig,Martywah,10,Mon Jul 13 19:40:25 2015 UTC,"In AU pugs, a team will sometimes go double LD, no snipe already. It seems like a viable composition that can still get the stop.  Banning snipers i'm all for. But banning Egocentric or unbanning Mines - I think you only want one or the other to go with no snipers.  Banning Egocentric means all the years of established routes and times are scrapped, not a good way to encourage new cappers i think.  I'm leaning more towards unbanning Mines. It'd cover the loss of a sniper. It makes offenses' role more critical because the capper has make sure the offense know which direction their approach and exits are to clear mines in that path. And resolidifies the fact that Doombringer is meant to be the HoFing class.  One issue with Mines however is should there be rules governing a class limit and where they can be placed. While it's obvious Mines typically go on the stand, they could also be placed beyond the stand on rock bounces/hills for a surprise."

Tribes,3d4tig,ZtriDer,5,Tue Jul 14 18:46:40 2015 UTC,"I dont know about removing egocentric from capping. It will severely limit the rout cappers can do because they simply can not get speed. Most of then known comp routs will be totally useless because you will not have enough energy to ""fly"" the distance that is required to do them. I guess if a capper do 2 minuts routs instead, they will be able to get back into the routs, but, do you want to wait 2 minuts for the capper?  And remember, a good team with offence players reporting back where the capper is going, do not need a sniper to spot. In this case you simply just ruin cappers totally instead of trying to balance it out. With the added player to go offence, you will have better spots. We alredy know that the top teams used to play without sniper spots."
Tribes,3d4tig,PowerTattie,3,Mon Jul 13 16:06:04 2015 UTC,"yes, we haven't tested anything at all but try some pugs with just snipers banned might be a really good idea"
Tribes,3d4tig,ZtriDer,2,Mon Jul 13 16:22:05 2015 UTC,"well, to an extent...A lot of the faster routes are the result of the capper jetting less after the initial climb. I remember playing around with impact nitrons and no ego a while ago and feeling like a lot of the same routes were still viable. Although this was close to 2 years ago I think, so I might not be remembering correctly."
Tribes,3d4tig,Yodsanklai,2,Mon Jul 13 21:09:28 2015 UTC,"If I am not mistaking, that may have been before they nerfed impact nitrons. If you want any amount of speed today, you need 2 explosives or 3 impact. Try run a rout today with 2 impact and you are better off playing soldier capping."

This would require people to play some other maps though, DD for one.."
Tribes,3d4tig,Luuigi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:49:32 2015 UTC,"Cluster was actually just the best. It really highlighted the skill of individual players with their aim, as well as the immense teamplay required to actually move the flag across the map.  I can't remember the exact rules but I'm pretty sure it was PTH/SLD/RDR/JUG for some time, but maybe JUG was removed from it because of mortars ruining clusters. I think Reach and concs were banned and there was some flagdrag applied."
Tribes,3d4tig,Nark51,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:11:57 2015 UTC,"Nitrons were banned as well, preventing easy concussions on stand. Also RdR missed the Emp as far as I remember. (I am not sure about Proxies...)"

I don't think I can believe there not being flag drag involved, since that would mean that cappers could just run routes and go 400kph as usual, without a sniper, a HoF or concs. The ruleset just doesn't exist anywhere anymore though (to my knowledge, since it was probably on a gameshrine forum thread) so I can't be sure about if i'm missing something or not. I feel like there was 150-200kph flagdrag or something."

Tribes,3d4tig,thynnmas,4,Mon Jul 13 15:40:41 2015 UTC,Dont ban ego because that will make capping harder for some. Setups would increase and caps would be slower due to regen. Just remove sniper then GGs. Perhaps new rule with reach. Perhaps first half if the game should not have reach and then last half enable it to increase frequent grabs for more intense esports.  I love the idea of escalation. Start the game slower and then add perks to increase intensity and franticness of the late game to get caps.  just an idea..
Tribes,3d4tig,angrypolak1,5,Mon Jul 13 15:32:35 2015 UTC,"To the people saying that banning ego makes all current routes impossible (or much harder) to run, try potential energy with impact nitrons and disc. You can double nitron and have 300 hp left, or nitron disc for 10 or so sanics more leaving you with 50 hp. I tried a few of the staple routes that people have been running for years now on arx, kata and dx, and could hit all of them more or less first try albeit a bit slower. You absolutely don't need ego for capping."
Tribes,3d4tig,duhlitz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:41:22 2015 UTC,"People probably wouldn't because its pretty tryhard, but most older RDR routes have enough leeway in them that you can run then without ego just fine.  Most of S4 sld-capping by jp was single disc if I recall correctly.  Bannning ego doesn't really make cappers much slower, it just encourages longer setups. If you really want to play no snipe and have chasing work try forced lightweight.  Or just play LT."
Tribes,3d4tig,AFireInAsa,-4,Tue Jul 14 05:38:44 2015 UTC,No snipers means 4 cap strat is actually viable and that's dumb because most of the time it doesn't require coordination.  Snipers are usually the main spotters and removing that role makes defense a lot harder on big maps.  Especially when you can have just doterow and blastman tdm on offense.Idk how the aussies do it but I heard they don't play Kara often because no snipers.  No snipers means figit cappers blackwaltz 2015 revival and grav cycles = ez grab ez game

Tribes,3d4tig,hobowithabazooka,2,Tue Jul 14 16:36:31 2015 UTC,"In my very limited experience, offence spotting is a thing. And I remember up until one year ago whenever I capped there was this uncertainty, like ""they haven't seen me yet, I might be able to cowboy this shit"", but now I get pinged by snipers on spawn, even when triple capping. It wasn't very fun one year ago, but now it's just unbearable."
Tribes,3d4tig,duhlitz,3,Mon Jul 13 18:56:29 2015 UTC,"Limiting the amount of coordination needed to move the flag off of the stand is one of the many things T:A needs. You've never played a game with lots of flag movement, and that's okay, but it shifts the coordination focus to be more about escorting, chasing, and standoffs.   When the flag is moving all the time, you need LO to be set up around the enemy stand in order to get e-grabs. This is why the four capper strat probably won't work out if the idea is everyone is for everybody to be running normal, long, setup routes. You're going to need offense b-lining it to the enemy base to pull off e-grabs. Any offense with a quicker pace of fast grabs, chain grabs, and even llama grabs will probably win out (this is what happens in other games like Tribes 1 and Legions).  With Muk's ideas, T:A might actually turn out more fun (hard not to be more fun then no fun at all). And I don't know what kind of defenses people are playing now-a-days, but it was a big part of the mMe defense for the chaser to spot and stop cappers (actually everyone on the team coordinated this including the cappers and LO, sometimes we'd even have our LO camp the capper spawns and fuck them up)."
Tribes,3d4tig,wordthompsonian,2,Mon Jul 13 21:23:40 2015 UTC,"pug defense nowadays is protect the hof or protect the snipe. LD is almost a pure fragging role. there's an ""honor"" agreement for offense not to kill cappers because capping in pugs is awful enough as it is.   In comp, it was always standard for LD/offense to camp cappers, some teams just did it better than others. As always pug!=comp"
Tribes,3d4tig,duhlitz,4,Mon Jul 13 22:42:01 2015 UTC,"the other problem here is everyone is going to disagree with something. Everyone wants to have an opinion, but nobody wants to compromise. Defense players don't want to get nerfed, offense players don't want to get nerfed. Everyone wants to have great games, but nobody wants to do whats necessary to get those good games.   Grow the fuck up people. It really should be about fun at this point, the try hard attitudes have GOT to go.   All I know is the current state of PUGS is pretty awful, and little is being done to prevent it from dying completely.

Seriously you dont want any of the 'oh shit' routes to exist? lmao, i guess majority of ppl playing that game and / or loving previous tribes titles (which to me for example look like boring shit without rock routes and 'easy to gain speed' movement system) are exactly the same. I am prolly among the few who loved inf, clutch sonic punches, cappers doing 400bounce routes and all that stuff; to me those things were among the coolest to watch / perform in the game, not that boring 'adad' with projectile shit which is only dependant on low ping and not actual skill and sliding down hills doing easy soldier routes."

Having two roaming D might help with the fragging power when it comes to battles on/near the stand but I have my concerns.

I am sure there will be exceptions but they will be far from the norm.  Currently, it is the norm to have to split up your offense if you want to take down a split defense around the same time.  The second LD (or whatever is used in lieu of the sniper) won't tempt the offense into clearing the snipe hill on Arx.  I HATE how strong snipers are in this game and if we can take it out of the game without fucking up others enjoyment of the game then I'm all for it.

Everyone else just parrots. Circle Jerks or just literally talks right out their asshole.   Again, you overestimate your own value.  No one wants to listen to someone who says ""I'm right and you're not even qualified to contest it.""  Even if you were right, who the fuck would want to listen to that kind of an attitude?"
Tribes,3d4tig,angrypolak1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:27:24 2015 UTC,"Ok lets break it down.    You want to talk about missing the point... how about the other day when I mentioned how much fun the LT tournament was (and that's all I did) and you came in and made it all about yourself. ""It only happened because I made it happen.""   NATL didn't host the LT tournament. I hosted the LT tournament via NATL. Organized, advertised, did the rule set, etc. It was all my idea and my pushing that got it done. The reason it didn't happen after that is because I didn't do it. You say I'm making it ""all about me"" , but you were literally IGNORING my involvement as if some other magical force was there to get it all together. It was me Rincewind, 100% me. So I'm sorry if it rubs me the wrong way that once again you fucks are ignoring a large contribution I made. Edit : To be honest, it was like pulling teeth to even get it done.   For me to ignore my years of experience playing comp and just let you spoon feed me everything you think and accept it as fact?   Like I said before, you made a comment by basically saying that there is no way to split an offense without a sniper. I gave a great example of how to easily do that on Arx. Your comp experience should qualify you to know what you are talking about, but you started off with something that to me, shows me that you aren't capable of thinking outside the  box that was made for you. Can you? That isn't an insult.    Again, you overestimate your own value. No one wants to listen to someone who says ""I'm right and you're not even qualified to contest it."" Even if you were right, who the fuck would want to listen to that kind of an attitude?   You are absolutely right, I'm fully aware people don't respond well to it. I'm just done caring about that particular aspect of things. I have my reasons."

Tribes,3d4tig,PPWGSCTPSGC4637,-4,Mon Jul 13 17:42:31 2015 UTC,i enjoy competitive gaming and would like tribes to be an e-sport like it really was in t1 which had a much larger following in game and of shoutcasted matches and was more influential on gaming than any of the sequel games no matter what idiot fan bois say with their incorrect statistics. t1 is also not boring to watch being casted unlike t:a which is just did he grab? oh hes skiing now. there is hardly any clutch ever.  this is something you have never experienced because you are most likely pub scum and stupid.  when tribes style game play gets standardized for competition (every game has the same physics and base game play but open modding) like cpma style quake did to quake 3 which has now created its own game reflex but with t1's physics and exact replica LT height maps and terrain shape the game will live again and be respected.  you all want another t:a tho so ull all probably get it.   me personally i want a game that plays as competitive both with aim and movement metagame as reflex does. and t1 was the only game of the series to provide that especially in duel arena and lt

Tribes,3d4tig,PPWGSCTPSGC4637,-5,Tue Jul 14 03:35:26 2015 UTC,i dont know what he plays like but ive heard positive things about his aim from multiple people.  im not calling him a bad aimer.  but i do know t:a is a terrible unskillful dumbed down game and that he's proud of being good at it to the point where he seeks validation from strangers  he clearly has an ego/attitude/insecurity problem that makes him vulnerable to being fucked with easily   so im calling him fresh meat if he wants to go that route
Tribes,3d4tig,angrypolak1,4,Tue Jul 14 03:46:36 2015 UTC,You basically just described me more so than Muhktar. (Minus the good aim lol)   So ya. I get that whole easy to fuck with thing. That's pretty much my M.O.   Nobody wants to spend a thousand hours perfecting something just to be told they are shit or what they did meant nothing.

Tribes,3czxxv,CasualBBT,8,Sun Jul 12 08:39:50 2015 UTC,Making evenly matched teams seems like the biggest problem in eu. Idk if it's being non native speakers or eaks' desire to win but from what I've seen some pugs are so blatantly stacked it's hilarious and no one wants to fix it.  It also happens in na sometimes but it's more or less people being quite during the game and doing random stuff like capping and not coordinating at all.  Idk how the same ppl play defense all the time too. Also offense needs to learn that you can shoot the ground and gain speed so u can go around the map to get to the enemy base and you too can interact with the flag.  I know very hard to understand for some especially skard.
Tribes,3czxxv,angrypolak1,5,Sun Jul 12 18:14:10 2015 UTC,Biggest problem with stacked teams in EU is that someone always cries repick after the first map instead of trading a player. Literally every time we repick atleast 2 people leave after we move back up to roles because they (understandably) don't want to wait the 10+ minutes it takes to get 2 more captains so we never have enough to start the pug again.  also stfu polak u kno flag is forbidden territoru

Tribes,3czxxv,duhlitz,12,Tue Jul 14 16:21:16 2015 UTC,"Make it worthwhile to cap. With such a small community, cappers are now few and far between. Everyone knows routes, and plenty of people run them in warmup, but no one wants to cap for a full game because it's boring spending 40 secs flying round the map only to get shut down almost every damn time. How about bringing back proxies for self clear, or maybe Reach (EU)?    This is the kind of stuff that made me quit the game in 2012. Seriously, this game is so anti-fun, I'm surprised it lived as long as it did. I can't believe people still PUG. Capping is like throwing yourself into a brick wall over and over. Chasing is practically non-existent. This game filled with uncounterable ways to kill you, like getting sniped from a mile away, getting infiltrated up your ass, or running over a mine field you can't see or clear.  You know what, I take that back. I can see why people still play it. This game is a true testament about how great the mechanics of Tribes really are. Skiing, jetpacks, midair combat, and capture the fucking flag. Even with these things boiled down to laughable levels, people will still play the shit out of the game.  I hope to the Tribes gods we all get a game in the future that keeps true the core mechanics and fixes everything else around them. A game that will make people quit Counter-Strike, and not the other way around, because it's more fun to play."

Tribes,3czxxv,-notacanadian,6,Tue Jul 14 00:08:36 2015 UTC,Something I think people overlook is that its easier to be shutdown D than it is to be perfectly synced offense. Especially x10 in a PUG atmosphere. People are lazy and most people play solo offense in a PUG. People have Totally forgotten the difference between a full scale comp offense and PUG offense. With that disparity its easier for a PUG defense to resemble a comp defense and easily shut down most half ass attempts. Throw in a mediocre capper against a shutdown D and you have 80% of PUGs.
Tribes,3czxxv,duhlitz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:24:03 2015 UTC,defense's respawn advantage to the flag is always gonna fuk with the metagame because offense always has to compensate for the travel time to get back in position and make plays. more so in bad games that have respawn delay timers like ta does to intentionally slow the gameplay worse so when theres a speed cap and 40 second routes (lol fuck that shit i aint playing a long distance driving sim im playing tribes)  this is why i really enjoy t1 LT because it does not have rigid regroups (in fact full regroup is a terrible thing in LT and if you watch historical LT demos you can tell who the not so good elite players are by how often they full regroup or call for it) you self clear and you can even cap 1v5 so u have more freedom to fuck with the game and psychology of other ppl by doing things to screw up the metagame in your favor - really terrible cheese tactics like repeatedly tossing the flag oob and off map to an unknown place on a dj 2 second front route can be a valid strat even to solidify and consolidate a 1 point lead for example vs a really good team thats owning your return routes with a psycho chaser like rtcll if you can pull it off  tack on 5 players that can do that and it takes the team awareness/metagame/teamwork game to the next level because of how much power and control individuals can have. the impacts of one person can become huge but so can team play. if each player on ur team is good at both then its gonna be gfg and you will see more clutch plays and demand for clutch plays in t1 LT than any other tribes game. thats y those legacy movies r so fuckin sick cuz a lot of that stuff is real shit that happened in competitive matches.   just because something heavily rewards individual skill does not mean it punishes teamwork or takes less of it.

Tribes,3czxxv,duhlitz,2,Sun Jul 12 20:02:32 2015 UTC,right. i know im speaking to the choir with you about the concept of LT. i know about tv LT and i didnt like it. and i know you get a lot of undeserved hate. and you were a regular tw member before a lot of bs drama.  but i also know ur brick headed as fuck.  and that before t:a even entered beta and you were looking for an active tribes game to play to get ur skills back up you came to t1 LT looking to be taught and u left cuz u got frustrated.  i think that was a really dumb idea and i think you'd like t1 style arena arcade LT more than chess style t2c base. both are great games im just talking about how i read you specifically and i encourage you to commit to it and try it again in small numbers pubs. it will give you a skill set in fps games that will make transferring to things like cpma pro quake game play or any other tribes like game easy.  im sure ill be down voted for this and proj will come attack me soon .  between rtcll and i we've put a lot of time into brainwashing fire. he's now at the piont where in a few weeks or so he'll be at the skill level where he could be considered even level with most of the greatest chasers in t1 (in a pub setting which is still huge and 95% of the challenge). he needs to be more aggro tho and break 30cks a few maps.  if u want to learn this or something similar but with capping ppl are around that will teach you srsly. or anyone else reading.
Tribes,3czxxv,PPWGSCTPSGC4637,2,Sun Jul 12 20:34:00 2015 UTC,"To be honest , Legions was the game that really set me in the sporty LT flag play based mindset. Id imagine it had quite an impact on fire as well.   I would have died and gone to heaven if T:A ever had a modded version of Team Rabbit.   Now combine Team Rabbit scoring with T2c chess base game and you've got my perfect tribes. One can dream.   Id play T1 LT often if I knew where/how/who. So far the only action ive seen recently is the occasional LT pub where i chain since its all i can do.   Since you read me so well you probably know Im an egomaniac so im usually only interested when there is something to win/prove. Pickups at least. Pubbing is just so..... bleh."

Tribes,3czxxv,Luka666,8,Mon Jul 13 06:09:58 2015 UTC,"How about bringing back proxies for self clear   If your solution to capping is to force every capper into using soldier, you may want to rethink it. Soldier capping is fucking boring (long, slow setups, hugely limited potential for flag-play), and proxies on self-clear are beyond obnoxious. When proxies were unbanned, and soldier capping was just being born, I could reliably self clear every single time. That doesn't incentivize capping, it disincentivizes every other role in the game. Offense thinks ""why should I clear for my capper if he can do it on his own"" and defense thinks ""why bother trying to defend the flag if the capper has a much higher chance of getting out without support?""  More LT pugs would satisfy your conditions, I think. Try some serious LT games sometime, they're fast-paced and incredibly fun for everyone."
Tribes,3czxxv,qhp,3,Sun Jul 12 09:14:41 2015 UTC,"I could reliably self clear every single time   You mean take the hof down or just get out? I'm sure reach would be a big factor if you're referring to the latter.  Proxies are pretty dumb for cappers yeah but what if the LD had them too? That way you give the capper and the defence an extra asset. Idk though, I didn't play comp/pugs when proxies were unbanned."
Tribes,3czxxv,Theheartattack,3,Mon Jul 13 02:53:21 2015 UTC,"I guess when I typed that I meant HOF specifically, but the LD can certainly get caught in the proxy crossfire. You can throw them mindlessly and as long as they don't bounce they will never hit you and the chance of hitting a target is super likely, especially with the common ways for LD to line themselves up to get splash damage on the capper.  Regarding proxies on defense: I mean, I'm all for trying things. I constantly speak against banning items, classes, maps, etc. If there's some way to balance proxies on capping, I'm all for it, I guess. I will have you know, though, that SLD defense (not only SLD LD but also SLD on flag) wasn't uncommon in the US at the time, and they certainly used proxies, but SLD cap was still an issue."
Tribes,3czxxv,qhp,2,Mon Jul 13 07:47:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah we just need to try out different shit really. The main concern behind unbanning reach in EU is the global effect of it on standoffs etc rather than giving cappers a slight buff. We banned fractals in EU and that buffed offence slides and offence in general but capping is still such a chore, maybe if we unbanned reach and also unbanned fractals that would buff defence enough against O slides to warrant cappers being able to use reach."

Tribes,3czxxv,Lowerend,2,Mon Jul 13 07:48:59 2015 UTC,"It might make a difference. If a single pug from picking to the end of the second map only took less than an hour total, I know I might consider playing a second one (and actually I'd probably be more likely to be pugging in the first place). As it is, sticking around to play more after the first pug took over two hours with all the waiting doesn't seem that tempting at all.  And obviously if instead of one long game you could play 2-3 shorter ones, it'd be more likely that at least one of those would be fun, and you'd never be stuck in an unenjoyable one for that long."

If we want pugs done in under an hour it's not the map times we need to focus on its the server joining and captaining. I'll make an effort to captain more but i'm only one guy, more people who've pugged for longer need to captain (lookin @ u zirien) also people need to not be shitheads and join the server in less than 40 minutes.

Well to be honest that seems to be the case no matter how long the match takes. Shorter matches seem like a good idea to me for pretty much the same reason why I'd rather bet 20€ apiece on five coin tosses instead of 100€ on a single toss. It's not that the odds get better overall, but at least it's less likely to be a complete waste. It's that prospect of spending the night stuck in a pug I don't enjoy that deters me.  It'd certainly be great if people were more active in getting pugs started, and by people I mean other people, not myself, but changing human nature is a lot harder than changing server settings."
Tribes,3czxxv,Billyb0i,2,Mon Jul 13 14:31:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was a bit surprised by the low turnout of this draft.  I wasn't following it closely or anything, just checked the TribesSchedule website and the other reddit post.  I knew it'd be low, but only 3 teams?  Ouch.  Plus it's during summer, where most people still going to school have a bit more free time.  It's interesting seeing the suggestions you threw out, as I've had almost the exact same for trying to make Legions a bit more active, like lowering the time limit.  What's the current capout you guys use, 7?  You could try lowering it to 5 and see how that plays out."

Seriously, I've seen a couple of AU pugs in the past where they just played without a sniper in either team and it still worked wonderfully. This would also take care of this:         Change something up to encourage more cluster play, to encourage semi-grabs, to encourage the whole O to simply walk it.             By the way, I wouldn't draw too many conclusions from this draft's low turnout, it's mid july and lots of people are vacationing, some are still studying for finals and some don't want to turn on the gaming pc with 35 degrees in every room of the house.

Tribes,3czxxv,PPWGSCTPSGC4637,9,Sun Jul 12 19:14:01 2015 UTC,they both have active and welcoming communities and as long as you show up willing to learn you'll get lots of help and support from either. even on tribalwar forums.   One thing T1 and/or T2c players forget is that many of these T:A players are European. Both of the communities you mentioned are mostly from NA which means EU players would have to play at potentially horrible times and with bad ping. That coupled with a T:A player's inherent inability to cope with the dated graphics will make it tough for one to actively enjoy T1.
Tribes,3czxxv,Ephixx,0,Sun Jul 12 19:47:11 2015 UTC,t1's community is filled with euros   in fact NA ppl might hate me for this but i get along with most of the euro and aussie t1 players better than i do with the americans.  in t1 the ping difference of an ocean is minimal.  for example TooL yesterday came and played on an NA server vs me with 16 ping he was at 120 and he fucking owned the server.  binswees frequently destroys everyone using disc only in t1 vs ppl with 16 ping laser precise cgs that have been playing for 16 years   idk about t2's netcode but i can promise in t1 with proper netsettings (interpolate and predictforwardtime set up correctly for your ping) you will not feel disadvantaged  please remember greaper and a lot of the most respected euro players are t1 fans at heart and know what good tribes games are about  they just arent dumb and primitive enough to start major dramas over video games so you dont hear about it a lot.   for a euro t1 irc channel try #t1mixed on quakenet or #t1alerts theyre low numbers now but these were full as hell only a few years ago  and international pu's were held between americans and euros and aussies for a long long time in t1 and were loved by all because the ping difference does not effect the game that much if interpolate is shut off and pft is set up right  the graphics thing i can't help. if you're a pro player ur probably playing low t:a graphics anyway so t1 or t2's graphics shouldnt matter. personally i prefer t1's graphics over anything because it looks jagged and video gamey like a tron movie or cpma pro game in quake   like an e-sport
Tribes,3czxxv,PPWGSCTPSGC4637,2,Sun Jul 12 20:46:29 2015 UTC,"I've known about the pingdifference being less of an issue in T1 compared to T2(c), though I didn't know it was that negligible.   That makes me wonder if it's due to skill or really due to the ping not being much of an issue. It would be cool if some T1 euro could clarify this.  The reason why I'm not convinced is because people said the same about T2(c). European T2 players like D_e_V_i_L got praised by many Americans yet iirc he wasn't able to frag on-par with NA players due to ping. So yes, while it's possible to be a good player cross-atlantic in T2, it wasn't remotely possible to be on equal terms. (with interpolate)   In my previous post I was merely relaying what stops many original T:A players from playing T1. Coming from T2 myself, I understand how even dated graphics have its allure, it's just that most T:A player's don't."
Tribes,3czxxv,Ephixx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:31:36 2015 UTC,you can see what was said about t2's netcode here   http://www.tribalwar.com/forums/showthread.php?t=49195  but sure ask euro players  i just know that i pu'd on euro servers quite a bit in t1 and aussie servers with no issues  and many euros and aussies pu on NA servers as well  i know about the devil guy and t2 and i dont want to talk shit but i just find t2 a lot easier and less demanding on mentall awareness than t1 LT which is more similar to an arena fps twitch shooter like cpma i also find t2 way more bloated and laggy even with interpolate and a low ping
Tribes,3czxxv,PPWGSCTPSGC4637,4,Mon Jul 13 16:24:38 2015 UTC,"It's not the graphics that hold people back, it's the shitty mechanics. I used to play t1 10 years ago but I can't go back to that skiing, it just feels weird and I don't see how anyone who started with T:A could possibly like it."
Tribes,3czxxv,eightnine,-6,Sun Jul 12 20:52:08 2015 UTC,"that;s a good point too.  but please keep in mind there are way harder game mechanics to learn than t1 skiing and aim that feel weird as fuck for people new starting out too. for example cpma, or starcraft beyond bronze league lel.  t1 skiing is gonna feel weird cuz it's jump and friction based. you stick and grip to things then jump off them. this even lets you ski up certain steep slopes without starting momentum. you don't really do a lot of ""frictionless boots"" sliding unless its down a steep hill when you arent even holding ski (you dont deadstop suddenly if you stop pressing spacebar in t1 and this lets you do some weird but very cool and rewarding things like carving)   i dont think anyone got pro in t:a in a week and i think if people that are frustrated in t1 or having trouble give it a week and vocalize what the issue is they can be taught and move on from it and realize it wasnt tough in the first place anyway.   please remember t1 skiing evolved on its own and wasn't designed it was a glitch like bunny hopping in cs or strafe jumping in quake and people just picked it up and ran with it and thats how tribes ctf competition as we know it even came to be. if people in 1998 with shit pentium 1 computers can do that why cant kids in 2015 with super computers?   quake built on its movement glitch and made an esport and cs balanced their game so it was more of an esport without it  companies that own tribes just nerfed the fuck out of it in the sequels for no logical reason other than devs not understanding the competitive communities wants ruining the easy freedom of movement concept that tribes fans loved  and tribes has been fucked since"
Tribes,3czxxv,PPWGSCTPSGC4637,2,Sun Jul 12 21:00:35 2015 UTC,"NATL hosted an LT tournament a while back and it was an absolute blast.  Lots of people enjoyed it, with the only real complaint being the custom physics they used.  People wanted another LT tournament but it never happened simply because no one organized it."
Tribes,3czxxv,Zwitterions,-1,Mon Jul 13 13:41:36 2015 UTC,"It only happened because I made it happen. It was ""vex hosted"". I was pretty much one of like 5 players that actually tried to organize LT teams and Pugs. Did you forget how much effort and leadership it takes to get people to try new things?   LT in TA is fun, but its p broken pretty much anyway you try to do it. Cant really play LT on stock physics without significant restrictions as well. But ya when I stopped putting in the effort to lead pug nights with new fun or made up gametypes like LT and others nobody else took up the torch."
Tribes,3czxxv,duhlitz,2,Mon Jul 13 18:28:43 2015 UTC,"Kind of agree with this.  T1 LT feels like a nice light version of T1. The 3 weapons have great balance, so it just feels like a cut down version of T1 without all of the base assets. T2 cluster is pretty similar, the 3 best weapons (plus mines this time though) - cut out the base assets and all the other crap.  Switch to T:A LT - it just doesn't feel right. Weapon balance is off - T:A works more as a complete game with other classes involved. It gets a bit tedious being limited to classes with 2 weapons.  We've tried T:A LT a few times, I think the fact that people prefer the standard ruleset compared to LT suggests that trying to go for LT just isn't going to work. People would probably be better off trying to tweak the existing ruleset to make it a bit more fun again."
Tribes,3czxxv,SudoAlex,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:32:21 2015 UTC,"To be honest the only reason we play without snipers sometimes in OCE is because no one wants to snipe any more, unless we get euro shitters in who can't do anything else. They do make for entertaining pugs though, generally.  The patented OCE 5v7 is probably one of the more successful things we've tried to do to pugs, at least half the time they end up being pretty close."

Just look at the games in early gameshrine ladders, they look so much more fun and interesting to watch/play then this retarded crap with latest rules you came up with where more then 50% of content is banned because tards couldnt counter particular strategies / aspects of the game. If anything, tribes comp community is as guilty in this game being dead as hirez is, you banned more then half of game content even tho people played with all that stuff for like a year+ without any problem. Everything should be allowed except orbitals which are the only uncounterable things in this game."

I liked playing tribes back when strategies were a thing, not when 50% of content is banned because shitters cant counter an inf / dmb mines / tcn repairing stuff / whatever else is banned in current shitrules im not following even."
Tribes,3czxxv,gst800,7,Sun Jul 12 17:13:56 2015 UTC,"The bans did indeed remove quite a bit from the game, mostly tactical depth and variety. But I wouldn't call the game being ""dumbed down"" as a result of the bans, more  ""one dimensional"".  In the end most bans were justified because the items that were banned had such a significant effect on the outcome and fun of the matches that it was needed.  That has nothing to do with people being unable to figure out a counter, in fact often they were already countered before they were banned. But what made the bans go through was knowing that regardless of the counter, the gameplay devolved into a state the majority of players disliked."
Tribes,3czxxv,Ephixx,3,Sun Jul 12 19:38:19 2015 UTC,"I did feel like the game had a lot more depth back when everything wasn't banned. As you said, the game has become more one-dimemsional. Clearing the enemy stand felt a lot more rewarding when you had to juggle mines, base turrets and alk mini-turrets. Sure it could be a pain in the ass, but it added some variety. Now every flagstand is occupied with a fatass brute or yolo-360 juggnaught with the standard pathfinder/sen combo(rip tcn :-S)I firmly believe though that turrets/deployables could have been a great part in the comp scene, if hirez gave a shit. // 4AM cant get all my thoughts straight but you get the essence of it.

Tribes,3cg3g6,nordsmark,3,Wed Jul 8 04:35:37 2015 UTC,"My game seems to crash quite frequently using this, mostly when joining servers or on map change. Also, sometimes the 1st person ammo counter will stop working (just showing a static number).  Still, great job so far! I love the utilities included in this release a lot :) Only thing I'd like to ask (other than crash fixes lol) - would it be possible to have the 1st person ammo counter untied from in game crosshairs, so I can use it with mumble xhair?"
Tribes,3cg3g6,MadWlad,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:24:58 2015 UTC,I will have a look.  So disabling in-game crosshair disables ammo counter too? As workaround you could just set crosshair scale to 0.01 or something and use chain xhair for all weapons. Should be invisible then I think.

Tribes,3cg3g6,bagofwiggins,2,Tue Jul 7 18:27:54 2015 UTC,Impressive stuff.  I'd like my damage numbers to alternate between L and O so a long string of chain makes a clean lololololololol. Possible? If so I'd happily learn a bit of lua
Tribes,3cg3g6,Zwitterions,5,Tue Jul 7 21:52:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's very possible... Check out the ""custom fancy damage numbers"", at the bottom of the documentation. What you want is pretty much already implemented, you just have to remove the code that makes the text rainbow, and the added damage numbers that goes into random directions.  This particular file is not commented, but the ""basic damage numbers"" example is heavily commented so you can start there. If you need more help I'll be happy to guide you, or to comment the file if that helps you.  You have to put the code in custom.lua in your config folder to make it work."
Tribes,3cg3g6,Schreq,4,Tue Jul 7 22:07:46 2015 UTC,those devs are so nice.
Tribes,3cg3g6,bagofwiggins,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:25:41 2015 UTC,If you have time to comment the file that'd be great.   And again I can make the first bullet hit say L and the next say O and have that repeat?
Tribes,3cg3g6,Schreq,3,Wed Jul 8 00:34:56 2015 UTC,"Ok I commented the source and updated the link in the documentation. Here's the direct link.  Depending on what you're trying to do, there are many ways to do what you're asking.   If you want single, disconnected numbers that say 'L' and 'O', you should base your script on the ""basic damage numbers"", and change it to store only 1 and 0 as the number value. Then when drawing the numbers, you can check if it's a 1 and draw a 'L', and otherwise draw a ""O"". However it will probably not always be beautiful to look at depending on the angle. If you want a single string of 'L' and 'O', you should definitely use the ""fancy"" base. You'll see that most of the work on the string creation and movement is done, you'll just have to change the creation and update of the string so that it only adds one letter at a time, a 'L' or a 'O' (you will need a counter to know if you should add a 'L' or a 'O' next). You will also have to remove some parts about rainbows and the damage numbers that go in a random direction."
Tribes,3cg3g6,Zwitterions,2,Wed Jul 8 09:14:34 2015 UTC,"Are more customization options for sounds coming?  I noticed that you included the t1 flag cap and return sounds in the folder and I want to use those soooooo bad.  Also, in the Hit Sound customization tab, I can't check ""use separate sound"" for Hit Sound.  I can do it for Blueplate and Air Mail.  If I change it anyway, I get an error when trying to save the config that says ""An error occurred trying to save the config file!""  Also, what is the purpose of ""Do not apply modification (clone)""?  Sorry for all the questions!  edit: uhhhh actually I'm getting even more problems.  Projectile swapping isn't working for me either.  I get this message in game: http://imgur.com/v3d5Hm4"

With it unchecked, the sound you select will be used for both midair types. It doesn't apply to hit sounds, that's why it's grayed out.  Yes, my plan was to have custom flag event sounds as well and that's why the sounds are there."
Tribes,3cg3g6,-notacanadian,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:19:52 2015 UTC,So to what extent will we be able to customize sounds? Custom firing sounds for all weapons would be a dream. Gotta have my shocklance make a fart noise.
Tribes,3cg3g6,420BROSCOPE,7,Tue Jul 7 23:31:45 2015 UTC,Dunno yet. Sounds like a nice feature but it's quite overkill in my opinion. Especially considering the amount of fucking weapons hirez added :D
Tribes,3cg3g6,Altairi,3,Tue Jul 7 23:42:05 2015 UTC,"About more customizable sounds, I think Schreq wanted to, but we still don't know how easy it is.  For the ""use separate sound"" button, it's not available for hitsounds because hitsounds are already enabled/disabled using the sound modes on the left (as well as the pitch settings, etc). The blue plate and airmail don't have pitch setting or a particular mode, because the damage is always the same, you just want to play a sound or use the default one, that what the button does (Schreq, mcoot, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong). Also for the sounds, I don't know if you had the issue but you have to manually create a sounds folder in your config folder to use them. I'll update the config tool download link soon so that it automatically creates the folders if they don't exist.  And about the ""clone"" option for projectiles, it's because of the scripting ability (or just color modifications). Let's say that you use devastator spins as mortar shells. And you want the spins fired by the mortars to be red, so you set the setting in the color tab. The problem is that the projectile is not cloned, so changing the mortar spin's color will also change the normal devastator's color. The clone duplicates the projectiles so that the modifications applied to one of the projectiles is not applied to the others."
Tribes,3cg3g6,420BROSCOPE,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:39:16 2015 UTC,"Fuck, completely missed the part where you said to make a custom sounds folder.  My bad.  Thanks for the info!"

I think the error messages are white in the new version, and it's basically saying that the projectile customization is not implemented, so I'd say that you're injecting an old DLL instead of the new one. Does any of the new features work ?"
Tribes,3cg3g6,-notacanadian,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:25:56 2015 UTC,Yes that was the problem. I figured it out later and forgot to update my post. I assumed that the injector would automatically grab the new dll so that's my fault.  Sorry for wasting your time!

Tribes,3cg3g6,MadWlad,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:20:41 2015 UTC,"Heh, I tried without the icons and names.  Yes, hitting people seemed better but how the hell can you tell the teams apart? Or see where the flag is going? At least for me the teams look way too similar despite the different skins. Could be because I have dynamic lights off or something, it makes colours less clear."
Tribes,3cg3g6,Coniks,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:08:35 2015 UTC,"removing player icons was something that was added in the last version. you're correct, I spammed the spot player button and it worked out okay, but it was really only good for rabbit. the new version has an option where you can change the color of the names and chevrons over peoples heads, or remove them completely by changing the alpha values to 0. this is very beneficial to players like me, playing on toasters at very low resolution, because the names over peoples heads don't scale with resolution and become absurdly large and it becomes difficult to see whats going on. you can change the values individually in the 0.4 version, so you still have the red and blue chevrons that indicate friendly and enemy players. It's working out p good for me."

Tribes,3cg3g6,AvianIsTheTerm,3,Thu Jul 9 02:25:50 2015 UTC,"Check out the ""basic damage numbers"" example at the bottom of the documentation. When a damage number is created you can see that 1.70 is passed to it as the timer value (that's the standard value for real damage numbers), so you can just change that to 2.0 or whatever you want. The only problem is that the damage numbers are really basic (they don't float up, change color, etc) so you'll have to customize them a bit if you don't want them basic."

Tribes,3cg3g6,Xolarix,2,Thu Jul 9 07:03:38 2015 UTC,Yeah pretty hard... I tried to make that work already but didn't manage to yet.

Tribes,3cc66z,evanvolm,6,Mon Jul 6 19:42:02 2015 UTC,Awesome! Thanks for sharing. I wish we had this stuff when we were working on TA. When we purchased the IP we got basically nothing physical/digital with it.   Very cool seeing where the origin of the tribes aesthetic came from. We worked primarily from in-game asset but used some of Royo's polished work for detail inspiration that the in-game stuff lacked.
Tribes,3cc66z,HiRezSean,3,Tue Jul 7 14:40:22 2015 UTC,"I wish you guys would have asked.

Diamond Sword looks are clearly space knights, with their templer helmets and armors, but there also the other Tribes with dif. looks. The desinger of T1 did a great job not to coppy the sci-fi-fantasy feel but vary it into something plausible space-mad-max like. Whereas T:A is going backwards in time making everything looks ""modern"" and less alien like. T1 is like 2k years in the future; T:A is like 100 years from now."
Tribes,3cc66z,bejesuses,2,Wed Jul 8 15:35:59 2015 UTC,nah ds in t1 look more like roaming armor tribe philosopher (is harry potter a knight when use that griffindor sword nah) it's just symbolic for combat and strategy in the ds pic  which is what they were supposed to be according to the lore  the ta being 100 year from now also doesnt follow the lore not that i really care about it but it was written p decently and interestingly in the t1 instruction manual for 1998 and a 11 year old kid

It's a really unique metagame too obviously and it's pretty deep in t:a  though i gotta say i like to play tribes games that take the highest level of metagame to really dominate in not just twitch aim or mechanics or even a good ping or computer and i go around and try to understand the metagame of every tribes game in the series deeply so im a real aficionado of this shit in the tribes series.   and t:a definitely for someone new to a competitive game involving tribes like fpsz gameplay could be really really deep as well  however t:a should have been allowed to be easily modded so ppl could make the game the way they wanted it and that would have made the community in total so much bigger and richer than just ""base"" t:a   t:a is great great game but not if you have tried a tribes game with better metagame. if you have you crave that instead and also im not sure if the engine or base physics were right for the series or if the skiing mechanic was that great. but this is only something that really happens to ppl on a competitive pro level most casuals don't care till they get competitive  mentally playing a game in a tribes like format has produced great metagame pretty consistently compared to any other game genre."
Tribes,3cc57h,bejesuses,3,Mon Jul 6 21:07:27 2015 UTC,recently ive noticed a few new schools of thought on the tribes series that influence its metagame heavily that have emerged since t:a and would have and have had a huge impact on the series  theres some ppl that want tribes to be more of a twitch hitscan shooter like cpma or quake live q3 more of legions style++++ where everything is super fast and precision aim reaction dependent the skill level is extremely high but getting there is terribly hard and time consuming.   theres some people that want tribes to be more about graceful artful precise skiing and route design a very specific skill set challenging to improve in hard to master but cool and powerful when you do  i think both of these new schools of thought are a bad direction to take the tribes series in or promote and would influence the fun things in tribes fpsz style metagame drastically changing it even further for the worse   perhaps there is a huge market for those 2 specific things but they haven't been major influencing parts of the tribes series yet and are only a recent thing so i do not believe they are important to anything market related historically in tribes
Tribes,3cc57h,bejesuses,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:31:56 2015 UTC,"schools of thought lol  ya im inclined to agree tho, i think tribes should be less about individual skills and more about teamplay. dont get me wrong, twitch aim, route perfection etc are valuable but id like to see a tribes game which is properly scaled and balanced, where gameplay demands that ppl work together instead of being lone wolves"
Tribes,3cc57h,TribalWanker,2,Tue Jul 7 08:01:23 2015 UTC,"i like being able to lone wolf and cowboy but also to have it equal with team work  here's wat natural the best tribes player of all time wanted in a tribes game and why he hated t2  http://www.tribalwar.com/forums/showthread.php?t=49195    -Heroism is gone -the gameplay lacks grace -you can't feel the enjoyment of a powerful disk shot that knocks a guy off track or finishes him off in a nice, crisp, explosion.  -same thing, except with mortars -more time is spent traveling than playing -skilled disk fighting D < robotic rocket launcher D -it feels like you're bulky in a huge mountain-filled world -poorly designed maps with flags indoors that are far too easily defended by overpowered turrets -the overpowered tank running over people -since you can't capture the flag so often in the capture the flag game mode, you get points for touching it instead -the network code was rewritten to become horrible... how many sub 30 pings do you see in T2 vs. Tribes/Quake/etc? -the game was the vision of one man instead of many -the beta process was oversized, then undersized, then rushed in order to meet deadlines (T1 was created much more carefully) -the wonderful promised ability to permanently ban accounts from servers was removed and now they claim that they would ""never support such a design element"" -renegades players are far too satisfied -the lead designer called Scarabre the best T1 CTF map (no joke)   I'm tired of typing. Feel free to flame, or add more to the list.  The tribes community is what made this sequel possible, yet most of us were utterly ignored. Ten years from now when people look back at T2, the greatness of Tribes 2 will be measured by its sales. And the artists of the original Tribes (whom we all owe a immeasurable amount of respect), most of which have left Dynamix, will soon be forgotten.   While this post is critical flame, it is also a pledge of thanks. An acknowledgement that although the sequel was tainted, I respect original the Dev TEAM members who created the first game, this community, and made our online lives memorable.   -Natural of IE  heres wat id want if i was spergin   if we r playing fantasy tribe game id like a t1 clone with better graphics theres just too much evidence and argument for it to happen  ideally at least andrew lspiro greaper nofix greyhound mj and bugs_ work on the project  so what is t1 with better graphics ifu arent porting the engine over directly.  short of that i want ppl to be able to do what they want with open modding on a game built around tribes style gameplay (mod diversity is key and is what kept t1 going forever and ever and ppl should be able to build the game they want easily)  then if thats not possible i want at least  a copy of t1 5v5 LT that plays identical to t1. or of t1 shifter_k or v1g mod. or arena. football mod. renegade. even annihilation mods. etc etc as long as it was a good and very popular mod esp competitive shifter arena and rpg  i don't want twitch aim   i dont want hitscan unless its a real improvement somehow but idk how or if i believe that it really improves latency   t1 was an internationally competitive game where u culd win at the highest levels on any other teams server even with 300 ping playing in australia from NA across the world because it compensated for it so well  and i like the projectile aim of t1 over hitscan of other games and its effects on the way it plays for those with xtreme latencies t1 was still very playable at high ping at the highest levels because of that setup.  i dont want complicated skiing i want it to be 1 button movement with no other ""movement gimmicks"" than jetting or with easy to learn good nuances that reward in good ways. for example disk jumping and also carving in t1 which allowed a lot of freedom of movement and improvisation from on rails routes/situations.  carving is basically when you see the jagged mean nasty terrain that screws your route up   lifting your thumb off the space bar momentarily before reengaging the space bar after moving over the jagged terrain  this really helps to keep things smooth and correct mistakes in route precision mistakes in a way that's very comfortable makes the mistakes far less punishing and more constructive and can be combined with jetting to do interesting fun things such as:   not spinning out while going fast on really really tight curves (sh be side back bowl) and in fact coming out faster on them. being able to reach your ideal trajectory and speed easily  momentary deceleration sliding downhill without skiing (no sudden deadstop)  good for correcting mistakes or to trajectory change mid route allowing you to change your momentum and route line slightly but critically (like skiing the back bowl of t1 sh and coming out shooting)   carving is like pivoting on skis or stopping with a snowboard or longboard.  t1 is kind of like street skating in commuter traffic in a major city. you plant weight on one foot (not engaging ski thumb off spacebar while targeting and lining up a new trajectory all in a split second) but still have momentum and are moving just possibly slowed or not before you replant your weight with the momentum and not against it (engaging ski again) which in those sports helps to create a slalom or carving or moguls traveling effect over rough terrain the same thing happens in t1 and you gain a nuanced skill to traverse terrain which is simple and not super challenging robotic autism kid stuff.   i want the combat to be as good as t1. seriously this is a big deal. t1 wasn't meant to have skiing so they spent a real lot of time on combat and physics and weapon balance instead and it turned out great. thats a big fukin deal. i dunno how to describe it more than that.   jagged terrain t1 video gamey tron style cpma aesthetic similar to this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ui0hz6sm0 but also with skin changing ability like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UInsRwP5sYA and solid colour skins  that is customizable in colour schemes . i want the terrain to have the option of being on a shape grid like this http://milk.iateyourbaby.com/Flag%20Models/sshot0047.jpg and also to be solid customizable or team based colours (again like tron) instead of terrain colours like lush grass etc but thats cool too   but the most critical thing really is the open modding cuz if its popular to start with but ppl have complaints about comp at least they can change it or even create their own community from the start and go in their own direction and that kind of diversity is key for a tribes like game cuz we all want to play it differently   also great server browser and tab score menu/objective screen/tab menus like tribes has and a very well put together gameplay guide"

Tribes,3cc57h,thynnmas,0,Tue Jul 7 07:12:23 2015 UTC,"What is interesting about using machine learning in settings like this is that there's a good chance it could pick up on things that people do that don't have a name, and don't realize how effective it is. We have names for basketball plays, but it's possible to objectively determine what factors are actually important to scoring. (Assuming all the information is there and decent features are utilized) There are a lot of subtle things that good players instinctively do that could be identified and taught to improve other players games.  The real problem with a lot of analysis like this is the amount of data.   HUGE amounts of data is required to develop decent models. It's one of the reasons why the NFL has added tracking devices to the players. Even then, the amount of games is pretty small considering the complexity of what's going on in sports games."

Also that txm roster was not pro league as were many other teams that moved up to pro league because a few players on the teams were pro and the rest were not."
Tribes,3c8b9v,mukhtar123456789,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:32:51 2015 UTC,"but whats so revolutionary of playing 5o on tart   Not a single team has ever run 5 O from the opening bell to the final cap in NATL.  on any map.  Besides Vex. That's what is revolutionary about it. Nobody else has ever done it and made it work. The thing that made 5O special was that it required you to perform well under crash type pressure regularly. You wouldn't understand that unless you've trained 5O , which no teams have done besides Vex and Txm, and TXM couldn't do it.   Other teams have ""tried"" it. One does not simply dip a toe in 5O, it's not like a 4 man D stack it's a significantly more complicated composition. It's also worth noting , and you can ask any of my teammates. I made it very clear that in order for 5O to work we had to commit to it from the beginning to the end. Other teams simply ""tried"" 5O and couldn't make it work. That is because it wont work unless you train it and commit to it as a team because all of the positions play differently.  Imo Tartarus and Katabatic are the maps best suited for it.    Its pretty normal for people to just quatra cap on tart and then just ""dstack"" when u die   It also was never ""normal"" for any team to quatra cap. Why do you keep making up weird not true statements?   Also that txm roster was not pro league   Yes they were. There was just a huge gap between the bottom of the Pro league and the top, much bigger gap then the bottom of the house league and the top of the house league. If you don't think that TXM roster was pro league, then Kout was never pro league either.  You were in the house league first weren't you Angrypolak?"
Tribes,3c8b9v,qhp,4,Mon Jul 6 01:38:17 2015 UTC,"i think you give the strat way more credit than it deserves. though i will respect that it is effective, it was new and the support behind it was strong but  when we played on raindance+dx very very long time ago (last match of TWL) it was basically like just 4 pathfinders running around spamming conks mindlessly.  the counter is pretty simple tho, just run 4d.  most of the time your strat was 2d and 5o.  you don't need 4 people playing offense when there is only 2 people there to receive them besides the occasional conk clusterfucks.  the other thing is that it really does make the game ALOT faster, you can't play shit like inf raider or jug, it's all soldier.  i had like 12 ping but the dps of even knives weren't enough at that point and i had to play soldier for the bigger impulse, more HP, faster strafe speed.  on raindance, it didnt feel nearly as strong because i could just run behind the stand and literally spam all 4 of my nades and some 900hp pathfinder was bound to die but that was alot more due to the restriction of the base itself.  on dx, it was completely different.  the base is alot higher and when there is like 4-5 pathfinders just waiting to conk from basically every angle possible, it became very very overwhelming.  i think the best map for it was DX at the time because the snipers didn't use the BXT (besides immune but that's because he didn't wanna play the inf minigame lol) and the map was so small that if you just got a thrust grab as path and started a punt train, it was basically a cap if you executed it well  kata is very very good also, i'm glad i was benched due it being my first match with the team :D  poor fucking zato, that kata game was a slaughter if you remember how it went.  lots of cover, fast routes, easy to clear (the hof is literally sitting on a pedestal and this was before brute or jug era) and self clear.  what was most annoying was that we got so much shit for realizing that running 4d against it was a very very direct counter.  you guys changed the meta to where it fit you the best and we had to find a counter because the 5o just everyone doing w.e the fuck they wanted was something very obnoxious for our team"

Tribes,3c8b9v,Implosions_,2,Mon Jul 6 04:25:21 2015 UTC,"i think you give the strat way more credit than it deserves   We beat 5150 , ZFZ, and other top 3 teams with that strat more than once each. I'm giving it exactly the credit it deserves imo. The credit is solely based on the fact that it works. My only agenda is to get it recognized as an equally viable strategy. I mean I thought winning # 1 on TWL would have solidified that, but the circle jerk here is stroooooong.   i think the best map for it was DX   I disagree. I think DX is the worst map for 5 O.    the counter is pretty simple tho, just run 4d. most of the time your strat was 2d and 5o. you don't need 4 people playing offense when there is only 2 people there to receive them besides the occasional conk clusterfucks.   Also disagree. From my experience the best counter to 5 O was zero cappers, and 4 raiders/jug combo to just kill the 2 D and get out with the flag and force stand offs. I feel like playing 4D against 5O is playing into 5O's strategy, not against it."
Tribes,3c8b9v,Zwitterions,2,Mon Jul 6 04:55:39 2015 UTC,4d worked as a pretty effective counter for us  i don't think 5o will have ever worked past twl outside of pugs
Tribes,3c8b9v,angrypolak1,2,Mon Jul 6 06:09:59 2015 UTC,"It was admittedly less useful once we changed the comp rule set , taking away turrets and all that extra nonsense. Also, as I recall you guys doing 4d didn't really ""counter"" it completely, it just nullified certain advantages and put us back on a more even playing field.   I would say that the fear of matin was what made vex change to 3D more than it was the enemies defense going 4 D. Either way they were usually good games weren't they? Fun exciting games, and imo that is what mattered most.   Also I don't think 5O has ever worked in pugs due to the insane level of comms and coordination to pull it off. And a hard counter isnt a hard counter unless it reliably shit on the strat. 4d never shit on 5 o it just made it slower and less effective but the games were still close.   been fun dudes. signing off."
Tribes,3c8b9v,LittleAscended,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:36:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with blitz, at least for when when I played. stacking more defense really played into the strat, especially with how robot mode most offenses were.

Tribes,3c8b9v,Zwitterions,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:14:40 2015 UTC,"I would say ZFZ did the closest thing to a hardcounter by not sending a capper and sending jugs/raiders to kill/walk.

Tribes,3c8b9v,pard0n99,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:47:43 2015 UTC,Btw it did work past twl up until S1 NATL finals.  Your team was the ONLY team good enough to nullify our advantage by having an offense so good we just couldn't afford 5o. Thats the honest truth and I know for most people truth hurts. From TWL to NATL S1 matin/bo/muk was just too fucking strong. No other offense even came close besides Vex.
Tribes,3c8b9v,angrypolak1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:19:00 2015 UTC,"We are talking about tartarus and the vod right? Cuz i have no idea what this rant about 5o is about. 5o is pointless on tart since it is already an offensive oriented map.  How have you not seen multiple cappers on tart before?  Idk im not going to argue about that because if you don't understand how to play that map by now then i guess you won't ever.  If you were trying to show off your 5o strats then you shouldn't have picked tart because that map is literally both teams get out and we go to standoff where you climb up trees. Or one team gets out before the other one and adoga + blackwaltz died early and d up to get the conk.  Comparing that txm roster would be like comparing the kOut roster with shepard. It wasn't proleague until we got people like snowy, bloody, and frell. Just like txm got people like soni, franchez...   Yes i was house league first.  also nice saber launcher strat totally not carried by Kigabit/Tasty"

Tribes,3c5qsf,bejesuses,0,Sun Jul 5 06:11:36 2015 UTC,Why are people playing T1 instead of T2?
Tribes,3c5qsf,Will12239,2,Sun Jul 5 19:23:25 2015 UTC,t2 was released with huge crashing issues and was really hated by most of the competitive community when it came out. a mod was made to clone t1 in t2 called t2 classic to try to save the game but it just isn't the same.  so y play a new game when the first one isnt broken and the new game isnt better or even as good?

Tribes,3c6ql0,perroTW,2,Mon Jul 6 04:29:10 2015 UTC,"It's gonna be dependent on map design as well. I don't have any real problems with legions other than the tricky skiing but tbh the two times I've played it they just threw me on home d so I have never really tried to ski. If it's better than t2 physic wise and projectile based weapons, it should be fun to play. We are never going to get our t1 clone just be hopeful that the next t1 ripoff is fun imo."
Tribes,3c6ql0,iateyour,2,Mon Jul 6 19:52:10 2015 UTC,legions looks like it could have had a legit chance at being a t1 clone if the physics were put in 100%  do u know if there ever was a t1 mod in legions. i need to ask fire that  when i play legions i feel like im bound to the ground but if i just had super jets and ez but deep skiing for speed like in t1 it might really be cool  the combat seems like it could also be tweeked to be t1  seems like the devs of legions were making it like that 4 a reason idk  anyway  legions movement is dumb 3 key movement instead of 2 is just retarded and wastes a key that could otherwise be something cool like crouch or toss pack or whatever (caps lock is normal toss nade left shift is crouch for me in t1)   almost as dumb as ppl from t:a and legions wanting tribes to turn into a twitch shooter.   completely taking the depth out of tribes 1 duel movement and putting it into some bipolar concept of either in insta gib ez mode shit like legions or dumbed down garbage like t:a
Tribes,3c6ql0,stuppor_terror,2,Mon Jul 6 19:59:37 2015 UTC,"a more t1 like physics set was tried out by a bunch of us, but it really didn't play very well honestly.  In some ways it worked great and in some ways it just sucked and was cumbersome feeling.  I do know it was tried on existing maps and those really needed needed the greater freedom of movement of the stock physics.  The smaller maps were simply too small, to the point where you just couldn't gain any speed or you basically ran out of room to do anything.  The whole game would have need a major overhaul, not just the physics."

Tribes,3c3kx8,pard0n99,3,Sat Jul 4 15:57:58 2015 UTC,Looks about as easy as T:A.  In T:A you have a lot less horizontal thrust so this route would prob actually be harder to do without thrust pack or exploding yourself.
Tribes,3c3kx8,pard0n99,-5,Sat Jul 4 16:25:59 2015 UTC,t:a is leagues harder than t1 in that its so restricting and boring (also has way more armors and shit than t1 base).  it's masochistic to play a game that slow imo.  maybe ill do a video comparing the skiing in all the games one day idk
Tribes,3c3kx8,mukhtar123456789,2,Sat Jul 4 16:31:18 2015 UTC,Ya a video comparing the different physics would be cool.

Tribes,3c3kx8,mukhtar123456789,2,Sun Jul 5 09:23:11 2015 UTC,"u like good combat in a game right? cuz ur some t:a pro gamer or something. t1 jets are not floaty. thats y ppl like rtcll enjoy fighting in t1. and he's legitly got pro gamer aim very close to any of those cpma guys https://youtu.be/C-THe3WLooE?t=840  look at this and tell me this isn't w0w  and it's not cuz the target floats in the air ez to hit.   t1 is way faster intuitively easier and rewarding man, than any other game in its genre of fpsz autsim. rewatch ur bud rtcll's pov in this shit level 2015 dead game pu specifically this clip https://youtu.be/C-THe3WLooE?t=840 for further proof.  but if u still disagree read a sperg essay about what i think about legions and some other shit below  other ppl have personal opinions that are different. but i make a point of going to each game and trying it to the point where i'm good enough to compete at a reasonably high level before i potentially write it off. i did this with t:a as well.          i played cpma and tried 1.6 when they first happened and settled in tribes 1 this is wat i like as far as competitive gaming goes maybe l4d or some other game that catches me one day idk but ive only ever been into t1 after everything ive tried critically   it's cuz of the way the t1 metagame plays out with its type of engine and physics. it's not floaty at all which t2 is.   remember t1 evolved on its own it wasn't designed to be some specific ctf type ski game just a squad based sci fi FPS game with jet packs. they were focused more on good combat than any movement shit. ctf metagame and skiing came after release when the ski glitch was found out about and ppl ran with it.   mods were so diverse. some ppl like matin went to t1 mods which had gameplay more like t:a some ppl stuck with regular t1 base like rtcll having the choice was the best part cuz a lot of those t1 mods are as different to each other as t1 is to t:a but are fukin amazing (competitive shifter, rpg, renegades, football, teamrabbit, etc)  but now that im high and drunk as fuck im gonna ramble some shit about some other shit  fact is t1 lt is the fastest / best / most deep / rewarding/ inclusive to new players (next to td or stuff targeted to sub genre audiences, mod stuff) / fast / fun game with metagame and gameplay when it comes to the idea of light jet pack combat ctf in small numbers that ive found so far. personally i think it's probably flat out the richest most robust esport type team game around and it's totally forgotten.   it is so fuckin deep, like the way some 1v1 quake champion thinks about item respawn timers positioning and the map while trying to out think and kill the other person and all the other shit they do deep but then t1 is even more deep than that for the ppl that want to learn, much more so than any of the highest levels in the other games.  simultaneously it's fast enough but not stupidly comically gib mod fast that it rewards my add craving brain more easily than any other fpsz style title yet that isnt t1 or a t1 mod. the base physics from the darkstar engine really have a lot to do with this, the luck of the base gameplay in t1 to be designed and eventually become cg/nade/disc for LT to popularize and work, but also for mods that had t:a style gimmicks like grapplers and weapon selections or played like totally different games or had no skiing only walking or base 10v10, all of which evolved on top of those base physics.   not only that but come on the videos clearly show how much more functional and just generally nicer feeling t1 is and it evolved to play this way it wasn't designed by some autist kids or corporate transexual (u seen john romero?) with huge egos. it just was a fluke chance that some spaceship autism game turned out to be competitively viable because of a ski glitch found in the beta. so fucking with that all these times making these different and unmoddable shit games and having these forum ego wars and shit is so pointless  im not anti legions at all i just never bothered sticking around with it when i found out it was not made to play like a tribes 1 or 2 clone by design (its similar but its not a clone of either game its more like a modded LT with a totally different skiing mechanic) which is cool i kno many good t1 ppl that really liked legions   i told fire this today   i taught myself legions skiing and can hit 200 on a route now (is that good?) idk im not pro i feel like skiing is really challenging and harder to perform much more than t1 but it's deep and feels nice once u get going fast (like t:a) tho it's still hard and feels restricting but ill have to play around with it more and watch some competition videos  it feels like you are being prohibited in getting speed like in t:a where as in t1 you are given speed and then encouraged to overdose on it if u want but u never really need to  i like the version of the torque engine (i think) its on cuz u could possibly import t1 height maps of jagged dx and create a perfect copy while scaling the physics and jump ski style of t1 and lt weapons real easily dang maybe i will try that i dueled some ppl and they said ""ugh its like you're not even new"" becuz i was out dueling them with the rocket gun but maybe they r retards idk gg   this was today the 2nd day ive ever sat down and tried legions. i think in total ive played 25-30 minutes but ive watched many videos on it and have followed it for years.   to me legions is a good game with cool graphics and what seems like a nice terrain engine capable of jagged terrain like t1 sh, but compared to t1 lt gameplay it's just too punitively challenging mechanically and demanding as far as skiing goes and less robust than t1 metagame   so it's like would i rather play a game where i end up with a demo like rtclls https://youtu.be/C-THe3WLooE?t=840 that's non stop action  or do i want to play games where it feels like im queuing in line to ski across a map at a pace that never changes or where i need a degree in pro gaming to figure out the highly punishing ski mechanic like in legions"
Tribes,3c3kx8,mukhtar123456789,0,Sun Jul 5 09:46:31 2015 UTC,so it's like would i rather play a game where i end up with a demo like rtclls https://youtu.be/C-THe3WLooE?t=840 that's non stop action  idk how to do fancy shit to quote but i skipped to bottom cuz really not interested in reading graduate essays  if you want constant nonstop action then legions is much much more qualified game that also takes atleast 20x more skill to become good at than the floaty noreaction games.  unless you meant that towards TA then oops
Tribes,3c3kx8,Rynex,2,Sun Jul 5 13:31:00 2015 UTC,sorry i am not on the tribes should be a twitch shooter that takes a lot of skill just to move around in like cpma or ut is  i like competitive tribes thats fun

Tribes,3c3kx8,MadWlad,3,Sun Jul 5 13:56:31 2015 UTC,All tribes games are welcome here. The fact that some people think otherwise is something that needs to be remedied. The fact that there's this weird turf war between the people who play T1 and TA exists because so many people feel that it doesn't belong here. Those people are wrong.

Tribes,3c3kx8,qhp,0,Sat Jul 4 17:30:06 2015 UTC,ya i dont like that. i like just being able to spawn and press right click and space bar and im 3 miles in the air and already going fast + half way across the map and ready to ski down or up a big hill   so much less tedious and more fun   can improvise with that shit too

Ya they were probably retards but it is easy to pick up Legions everything is easy to learn even the rocket.  Next time you load up the game press create game and try the map called Stygian. It's kinda like DX in Legions, it's even a little jaggy (guess bumpy would be better word). Maybe the hardest map to learn in the game."
Tribes,3c3kx8,prettzl,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:27:44 2015 UTC,200 wasn't that good was it.  I think my route vids were all 250+ and those were before a lot of the combo jumping hilarity that changed how people capped later.  I know on maps like zenith and blade run etc it was all about hitting 300.  Map size made a huge difference though.  Obviously hitting 200 at grab on frostbyte didn't matter in the least.
Tribes,3c3kx8,prettzl,2,Mon Jul 6 20:27:21 2015 UTC,ya but it seems like legions is more llama based in ctf anyway  and seeing the way u guys llama is pretty shit thus far  its cool that u all tried to play ultra ren style LT tho looks like it was fun 4 u :-)
Tribes,3c3kx8,qhp,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:54:03 2015 UTC,"depends on the map.  zenith is pretty much impossible to llama on against any good d.  frost is pretty much spam front routes and llama when necessary.  map size really determines play style, just like in any tribes game..."

Tribes,3bu34y,AFireInAsa,4,Thu Jul 2 15:04:24 2015 UTC,"I think the T:A maps are actually pretty close in size to the T2 maps they ported. T:A player models are, however, significantly shorter than their T1/T2 counterparts, something like 70% the height.  I suspect most of the perceived difference is just the difference in camera height and the physics being way more dependent on really long setups to get speed. If you'd ever played T:A DX with more classic style physics (scaled to the maps, not the player size) it feels much more similar.  This actually makes T:A by far the ""fastest"" Tribes game, whatever that means."

Tribes,3bu34y,AFireInAsa,4,Thu Jul 2 05:43:40 2015 UTC,"here is a quick clip that shows   dj in a high ark breaking the cloud line from dx base to dx base. no momentum added just a standing hop jump dj. aka a base to other team base's llama grab. llamas are a huge part of LT gameplay dj parallel to the ground to hopping on bridge pillars twice in total to the other base, no added route. just a flashy kind of look at how precise but ez these physics are to use.   both are like between 5-15 seconds to traverse the whole map   http://youtu.be/TEWpI52POCk  ya the map is smaller and the op post doesn't show how quick the routes can really get but the disc jump and movement is way easier and quicker in a good lazy way too than in ta's which is more lazy limiting/boring"
Tribes,3bu34y,AFireInAsa,0,Thu Jul 2 05:57:45 2015 UTC,"Why don't all your routes go into the clouds, like hooty routes, you are clearly invisible up there.  Look at all that fog lol.  I guess route visibility isn't really an issue in T1 since no one snipes you out before you grab.  You don't disc jump since the jets are so powerful you don't need to.  So you are never flying around with 20 some odd hp praying a stray bullet doesn't kill you like in T:A.  Man I shoulda capped in T1, looks so much less stressful and easy.  I guess you get blown up on the stand a lot though since no one ever clears, am I right."
Tribes,3bu34y,hobowithabazooka,5,Thu Jul 2 17:35:01 2015 UTC,"I guess you get blown up on the stand a lot though since no one ever clears   I mean that's the role of LO to clear the stand but it's not the same synchronized, coordinated, to-the-second effort that you had to do in T:A just to get the flag off. This is a good thing imo, and it's mostly because self-clear in T1 is very strong. Imagine playing defense and then seeing this come at you.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrh8tRHRjdw  That's 3 grenades. Maybe you're thinking of some cluster videos you watched where people play naked and don't have a grenade launcher as a weapon to clear, so stand defense looks a lot stronger. In LT or base where people carry grenade launchers, self-clear is very effective on most maps and most stands. Llamaing and chain grabs are also very important because of the power of discjumps, the size of the maps, and the ease of picking up speed.   If you watch a recording of someone playing LO, you'll see how flexible the positions really are in the game. The flag is constantly moving and off the stand so you'll see them escorting, playing defense, returning the flag, holding the flag, and making chain grabs whenever possible. A lot of the skill involved is figuring out what's the most efficient thing to do at any point in time because there are so many options.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrh8tRHRjdw  Playing offense is a lot more fun in T1, as is defense and chasing."
Tribes,3bu34y,pard0n99,2,Thu Jul 2 20:30:18 2015 UTC,it's synchronized to the second team work just done on a less rigid and more situational individual basis. everyone is compensating all the time for each other. t1 lt is the most team work intensive game ive seen by a large margin.   and what you are saying about lo is a big example that you can't follow it.  try clearing stork and rtcll to get a good route off on a hard to grab map. lo takes a lot of team work and precision and that's the metagame of t1 LT.  the metagame in LT is more like a fractal neural net than some kind of logical flow chart thats what always fucks people over is learning the timings/team play at higher levels  that route you're explaining  it isn't a big stop cuz of the 3 nades. its a big stop cuz the route he stops comes in completely blind devastatingly fast at that position and it was 7-7 vs rtcll in a pub this same map actually https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UfP9WaxYi0
Tribes,3bu34y,WorkingAsIntended,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:35:40 2015 UTC,I was showing off the self-clear with a grenade launcher is all. The most people generally do in T:A is to shoot a disc when they're coming in because they only have a disc/chaingun.

Tribes,3bu34y,pard0n99,2,Thu Jul 2 18:25:30 2015 UTC,"t1 skiing is retard ez   You really have a warped perception of the difficulty of learning Tribes 1. You've played it so long you don't even remember how hard it is to learn how to ski and route. It's second nature to you.

Tribes,3bu34y,duhlitz,2,Thu Jul 2 21:39:58 2015 UTC,"fire please tell me how holding space bar is more difficult than that shit in legions where ur pressing 3 different buttons and have all of these rules like not being able to side strafe. or ta having to fly into a rock to glitch a bounce and hit routes perfectly. or strafe jumping in quake live or any type of cpma ut movement.  that shit all sucks  t1 is retard ez you hold down spacebar  i didnt even have a ski script the first few years i played t1 because i played non skiing mods with real guns and stuff or magic where u walked everywhere (lol ya they have those there are servers of them up right now) or i just walked way oob to the fog line on scarabrae and sniped on the servers that always had 64+ people eventually i had played so many mods and was a master sniper in every one :-) i also picked up tapping jump once in awhile walking down hills to speed things up (ever use space bar to scroll through reddit comments without mousing? like that) and eventually i just did it rapidly but never super quick like pro ppl were doing that shit will break ur keyboard   one day i saw how fast the people were moving over the hills without disc jumping and then sliding everywhere (in t1 u slide down hills if you aren't pressing anything at all just not very fast) and got a ski script the guy just said hold space bar and u will go fast  that was it   learning routes, learning capper timings, etc etc is all different than just skiing  any retard can ski canyon crusade in t1 for example. these dx routes maybe not right off the bat but in 25 minutes the time it takes to practice a map ya they will be."
Tribes,3bu34y,duhlitz,2,Thu Jul 2 21:45:00 2015 UTC,"shit in legions where ur pressing 3 different buttons and have all of these rules like not being able to side strafe.   Not even sure what you're talking about. It takes one button to jet up if you have the combo binded. Not being able to side strafe? I'm pretty sure you could do that, whatever exactly it means.  I'm not talking about skiing as in just hold space. I'm talking about effective skiing. Skiing well enough to perform simple routes and paths consistently and not fuck up constantly. Learning the fundamentals and basics of the movement.  Flying into rocks to hit routes is pretty much what you're doing in T1 all the damn time. You need to land on every surface in a very precise way in order to maintain or gain speed. There's much less leeway with bouncey skiing than smooth skiing where you can land pretty much anywhere on a decline and know you'll be alright. In order to know exactly where to land at all times you need to know these jaggy maps in and out; all the creases and crevices and if you can maintain speed by landing in them. You have to have skiied them thousands of times in order to be a really successful skiier.  There's no air control without jets in Tribes so doing microcorrections in your flight are much harder. The jets are also very touchey and take a long time to get used to. One exercise I have people do who are just entering the game for the first time is to stand on the flat where the flag is on DX near the edge to the outside, jet out and up then back over to land on the landing above the flag stand. You'd be surprised how long it takes for people to even get this down. You need a jumpjet script in order to take off the ground optimally everytime, otherwise you will need to develop the muscle memory to jet at the precise moment after you leave the ground from a jump. I've brought in people who couldn't even leave the ground for more than a few seconds because of this.  Between learning how to ski effectively in a game like T:A (or Legions) and a game like T1, there's no fucking contest. You'd be an idiot to not see it (you probably do see it and are just fucking with me to begin with). T:A is so much more simple to learn how to be an effective skiier. Learning how to be an expert skiier and capper is closer in difficulty, but still easier in T:A in my opinion. The precision of rock bouncing is the only thing that compares to what you're doing at all times in T1 with bouncey ski.   in 25 minutes the time it takes to practice a map ya they will be   Rofl, I've taken more than that amount of time to attempt to learn fairly simple routes, fail over and over, and give up. I still don't think today I can run a single route well. Okay, actually I think I can run a front on Hillking.  Talking about a game like CPMA, that game is actually similar to T1 in difficulty. The ideas are even more far fetched than T1 and the movements and speeds you have to move your mouse are really hard to get down, way too difficult imo. Once you have the basics down of circle jumping, strafe jumping, and air control, it is easier to use these tools and not fuck up than it is to use T1 movements. But near the top end it gets much more difficult. Defrag and other movement stuff have much higher skill ceilings than skiing in Tribes. It takes years of playing to really get down the circle jump so you can clear certain gaps.  UT movement is literally just pressing the dodge button and wall jumping here and there. The basics are the easiest of any of these games, the hard stuff isn't too hard either."
Tribes,3bu34y,jesusboy76,2,Fri Jul 3 02:52:52 2015 UTC,"you and opsayo are like the worst teachers at this shit srsly u guys make it really overly complicated and you're very black and white thinking binary absolutest shit freaks me out.  most games were never designed to be super competitive but just fun and good sellers and t1 was one of these things so it never got the t:a, t2, t:v treatment of quick tutorials for learning skiing or anything. there was no skiing tutorial in t1 because skiing was not meant to be in t1 when it was released. the tutorial systems like t:a has t:v has or even t2 aren't that bad at all. in t1 there were just tactical walking based tutorials to shoot the weapons use the machines look at a map etc. buy the chaingun then shoot the got milk guy in the head etc. fly the spaceship.   effectively skiing. like i can understand wanting to learn the top level competition strategy but i wouldn't take instruction from a person like opsayo that make it more magical fantasy story time shit than anything basic. reading what ur telling me ur the same way.  want to teach people who have already played a tribes game to ski in t1?    get config with right click having jumpjet already bound. (all configs already have this) or if u want to be more sperg just tell them to always press jump (spacebar) before and continue to hold as they start jetting for a split second. get config spacebar ski script. all configs on the internet already have both these things built in. most people arent retarded change map to canyon crusade. tell person with said config to walk or jet or climb or whatever they want ""meet u at a high hill"" once they there tell them to jump off the hill and follow you. you can explain how they do it by saying press and hold ski and right click is jet or whatever. if u do this for 25 minutes they will know routes on canyon crusade the easiest most retard map in tribes that isn't flat. simply going in a straight line from one flag to the other flag is a route if you don't walk. if that map cant be skied in a circle after 25 minutes the person is legally retarded.   but y would u want to teach ppl that dont have an interest to learn it themselves idk. the only ppl id try that with are people already playing the game actively and just bad or wanted to learn because they were from a t1 mod that didnt use skiing or a real life friend etc. teaching video games to get people to enjoy them wtf is that. if people are interested in the game theyll figure out a way to play it on their own eventually or with minimal help like what t:a did with its simple tutorial system which would have been pretty decent if the game got any faster.   anyway skiing doesn't need some philosophy of the history of tribes bullshit or whatever the fuck that u ppl that say its hard get hung up on to learn. that stuff is just for nerds and people who are really into the history of the series.   so skiing was always taught to ppl by word of mouth anyways. everyone that ever played t1 competitively learned to ski on their own or from word of mouth. most of those people are on tw and are inbred retards. you are completely fucking stupid if you think t1 skiing is too hard or some bullshit. t1's skiing was an unintended engine glitch that people picked up grass roots because it was easy to do and then they made it so popular all the sequels had it included. some people played mods competitively that didn't require skiing that owned too.   takes longer to ""level up"" so i can get some kind of fancy energy pack in t:a to run the route i just memorized in one view on youtube in t:a.  t:a is both easy and hard in more ways than what i just said and every game is like that. to me its like a wacky t1 mod that fucked with physics and gameplay. there were lots of those. i have a.d.d. so i dont want to be sitting skiing like i would if i was playing heavy offense in t1 while im in ""pathfinder capper"" armor in t:a. where im waiting 5 seconds to ski in a straight line down a smooth hill.   anyway legions skiing is very fucked to me because the options menu has 3 buttons (jet, down jet LOL, and ski? or some other setup idk im not gonna check) and i thot o maybe this is jump jumpjet and ski. because a lot of tribes came with different sets of menus than others over the course of tribes. as so many ppl had proffered script packs by people that friends recommended. so sometimes u don't get a 1.11 or whatever download of tribes with just jump and jet. sometimes u get a ski script, sometimes u get an option menu button for a ski script, or jump jet, etc, etc many gui things. it really was a totally community built game. right from ctf being picked as the game type to play. and how the ctf would be played with skiing etc. that stuff was never even on the radar for the devs at all until way after beta. blah blah skiing in legions is way too complicated for me and takes pro gamer skills just to mvoe around with. im pretty g00d at vidya myself. i watched this youtube and a few others. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4CbBLLe2TI i cant figure it out. it definitely isn't as simple as ""Climb a big hill and hold spacebar to go down it fast in t1 and press jet to get up""  if u find ut and all that other button tapping shit easy you are a different type of person than me"

Tribes,3bqtya,perroTW,5,Wed Jul 1 16:10:29 2015 UTC,"3:31 is a great example of horrible physics.  Honestly, most of these route you are just wasting huge amount of time during setup to grab at the same angle, health, speed, etc as much shorter routes that have been around a really long time.  You also have a tendency to land on shallow slopes and at the top of slopes where you lose or remain at the same speed vs gaining speed on downslopes.  Work on your jet management as well.  You should be jetting typically in a single press with minimal if any corrective jetting needed before your next hill."

Tribes,3bqtya,pard0n99,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:10:00 2015 UTC,"It's always a good idea to ""sniper proof"" your routes, and set ups but you can only go so far on your own. Which is why I never really buy into anyones claims about ""route viability"" because with the right support structure, any route is viable. Every route is sniper-bait to a perfectly positioned sniper, and every route is easy when a sniper is dead. etc."
Tribes,3bqtya,qhp,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:12:16 2015 UTC,"O, ya this front route, I dont know why you would do any extended setups unless you can grab and get the bounce at full speed."
Tribes,3bqtya,pard0n99,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:28:03 2015 UTC,"You can go from 300 to 0 very quickly by holding back/S while in the air and not jetting. That gives much more precision and allows the capper to be more consistent and reliable than skiing poorly to go slower on purpose (???) and leaves you with significantly more energy. As Blitz said, if you need to go slower, why do a long looping setup? On a map like Arx, the sniper can see you virtually anywhere, a looping setup around your side of the map is just as likely to get dinked as being behind their base."
Tribes,3bqtya,Kirotera12,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:06:00 2015 UTC,"YA I dont know why you would do an extended setup.  But he is definitely slowing down to get the bounce,  Like 230-250ish you can get this front to aqua more consistently.  I don't think your method of slowing down is better."
Tribes,3bqtya,MKRWSeek,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:53:07 2015 UTC,"3:04 I jump to slow down, 3:08 I climb the small hill to make the front easier.. it probably slows me down a bit. Its mostly just poor skiing because of my poor mechanics.  I guess with the long looping setup you mean the route starting at 4:12.. It's just a fun route. The vpad U-turn route is better if you can run it consistently."
Tribes,3bqtya,duhlitz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:01:23 2015 UTC,"Your mechanics are way better than most players. I tried getting those bounces and I sucked balls. Then again, I'm not a capper. I don't think people realize these routes are just you showing them your fun creations. Too critical, these people."

Tribes,3bqtya,b00tyclap6969,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:39:35 2015 UTC,"LOL, thats doubtful, show some proof please.  I know these front to aqueduct bounces were popularized in America by Tastyham, and noone really ran them because of how difficult they were.  I don't think even Matin ever ran this front to aqua in a competitive match because how iffy it was.  He usually bounced off a rock in the river.  I don't think I have ever seen this 330 left route, but the extended setup is really not worth the extra speed cuz you get sniped out regardless.  So really no reason wasting time with a slower setup unless you happened to spawn snipe hill and wanted to do a left.  Not to mention the thrust in the air that he has to do to get to stand because he is going so fast really makes this route kinda iffy.  I'm sure people were experimenting with these types of routes, but no one was running them."
Tribes,3bqtya,pard0n99,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:59:16 2015 UTC,"pretty sure the first really public showing of the aquaduct bounce was done by aurora on zfz long before anyone had ever heard of tastyham.  It had been played with for a while even before that...  My point about speed wasn't that he should be doing a 330 left, it was that he is running super long setups and is still going slow.  He can cut off enormous amounts of time and hit the same speeds easily with better mechanics."
Tribes,3bqtya,angrypolak1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:51:34 2015 UTC,wish i had recorded all my routes from back in the day. i remember messing with aqueduct bounces back in the scrambler capping days.
Tribes,3bqtya,perroTW,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:20:01 2015 UTC,"Ya, I have no doubt people were experimenting with the aqueduct bounces."
Tribes,3bqtya,pard0n99,-3,Sat Jul 4 03:03:27 2015 UTC,You should be jetting typically in a single press I have yet to see any capper do that because the downside of jetting too much is far worse than correcting yourself after
Tribes,3bqtya,duhlitz,6,Wed Jul 1 16:33:23 2015 UTC,wut.  There is a huge difference between underjetting a touch and having to correct or overjetting a touch and having to correct vs constantly correcting on every arc...plenty of even mediocre cappers routinely do not have to use corrective jetting on routes they run frequently.  You get a feel for where in an arc you can stop jetting to reach whatever downslope youre aiming for pretty quickly...
Tribes,3bqtya,hobowithabazooka,0,Wed Jul 1 17:00:23 2015 UTC,"I think Angry is right in this. If you overjet in this game you really fuck the route and will most likely come in way slower than your supposed to, if you come in at all.  This is because your horizontal speed will carry you past your landing point and you will land somewhere garbage, like on the foot of a hill or something, and the route is blown.  If you underjet you can usually correct it, and you can feather your jets A lot to correct things.  You can single jet cap on certain archs for sure, but it is really not worth it.  If you have ever played the game you know you can make lots of micro taps to perfectly hit a curve on a hill without losing any speed really.  This is because gravity in T:A is so strong that once you are on the downside of your arch, the microtaps will not effect your momentum that much, but help you land smoothly.  There are a lot of parts of routes that have no archs and you want to feather your jets right into a bounce, because if you hit it ascending or descending it fucks the bounce."
Tribes,3bqtya,pard0n99,2,Wed Jul 1 18:10:44 2015 UTC,"His opinion for preference on over-jetting and under-jetting isn't what I was disagreeing with. I'm saying his notion that he's never seen a capper attempt 1 touch energy management is flat out wrong. It's not even a opinion.   As far as feathering your jets or jetting too much, either one is going to stop you from being the best capper you can be. /end"
Tribes,3bqtya,qhp,2,Wed Jul 1 19:24:34 2015 UTC,the point he's making is that ideally cappers should only be jetting when going up and meeting the hill perfectly when going down. Every bit of feathering whle going down will reduce your speed and leave less energy available for things like thrusting around a bodyblock.
Tribes,3bqtya,duhlitz,-1,Wed Jul 1 23:28:54 2015 UTC,"Fucking gelbatron telling us how capping works. =).  No he is saying that this new capper isn't a perfect capper cuz he's not single press  jetting.  Angry is saying that single press jetting on your ascent is dangerous due to over jetting and messing up the route.  Losing ten speed cuz you tap your jets a bit at the apex of your arch is worth not completely botching the route IMO. And, I would say most cappers in T:A tap a bit at the apex and right before they land to avoid retarded craters."

Tribes,3bqtya,pard0n99,3,Thu Jul 2 16:02:47 2015 UTC,Active with four people arguing about their autism. I am one of the four.
Tribes,3bqtya,duhlitz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:32:06 2015 UTC,"Single press jetting on each arc is ideal.  If you need to make a correction after the fact due to overjetting on the ascent, do it, but that doesn't mean it is ideal.  Most quality cappers will need minimal corrective jetting on routes they run frequently, and as such they will be much faster and effective cappers than someone who caps like the OP.  He is not making small corrective jets occasionally, he is constantly correcting and fluttering due to lack of mastery of the mechanics, and on top of that he is even landing in less than optimal places on slopes even after the corrections.  Most of these routes in the hands of better cappers would be 30-50 faster without even optimizing the route just because of mechanics.  edit: seriously, just rewatch even just the first route of the video.  I think on every single arc he is making at least one corrective jet, and seems to average closer to 3.  He is even tapping his jets on small arcs where he really doesn't even need to and doesnt even see a benefit from the tap, just a halting of his energy regen.  His thrust adjustments are done at about half of full both times as a result."
Tribes,3bqtya,qhp,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:46:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe, think these routes are pretty fast for what they are, you don't really need to go 330 on a left grab heh."
Tribes,3bqtya,duhlitz,7,Thu Jul 2 18:31:24 2015 UTC,"Perro is totally right. Perfect skiing would be one touch energy management. It's a universal rule among all tribes games, and every good capper tries to do this, I have no fucking clue what you are talking about.  I mean it's impossible to do it every time, but saying you haven't seen a single capper try to one touch energy manage an arc is , just... so wrong. wtf lol."
Tribes,3bqtya,perroTW,3,Wed Jul 1 17:45:29 2015 UTC,"If you guys want to hear it from someone who is usually on the other side of issues with Blitz: both Blitz and phana are right. The best, fastest cappers in this game only jet going upwards when they can and the way to be fastest/have the most energy is to do all your jetting at once. If you're underjetting and correcting afterwards, you are losing a lot of energy and a bit of speed.  I do find it funny to see less informed players argue about capping with phanakapan, though. glhf with that."

Tribes,3bjj9u,StorkSooFly,0,Tue Jun 30 00:40:14 2015 UTC,Top 10 active I can think of in quasi-order:  Rtcll  Izza  Vamp  Dare  Milk-Man  Snow  Ipman  RepairBot  Lestat  Orange

Tribes,3bjj9u,rawtpoker,3,Tue Jun 30 00:07:42 2015 UTC,"actually i dueled him yesterday and it was pretty much even. but the map kind of favored my style of gameplay, i think on other maps he would beat me. i also think he's really inconsistent and maybe was just playing bad but iunno. i don't play much at all tho since most ppl don't want to duel and would rather td or arena, if i could fine more ppl i would be way better. and not ppl like gim who say they will duel you and then ask you to td the next minute.  i changed it anyway to orange i think he's probably a better dueler and there are some more that are better that i'm not remembering."
Tribes,3bjj9u,shadoh210,3,Tue Jun 30 00:14:21 2015 UTC,michelob is not bad anymore  2011/2012 ya sure but him shado and all of them improved a huge amount  even gim   u should td more i need a good partner i always get stuck with ipman and that guy is crazy angry reminds me of chump or someone
Tribes,3bjj9u,StorkSooFly,2,Tue Jun 30 00:34:01 2015 UTC,"its funny because according to rtcll, stork is the best dueller (besides him and izza, ofc) that currently plays. which is odd because the last time i saw stork in arghs was like 3 years ago and he stayed for like 1 map. but then you have this like 15 year old rivalry where stork and mich used to shit talk each other on TWL so they still hate each other or something. its kind of funny to hear it from michs perspective, they both sound pretty butthurt over shit that went down on TWL like 15 years ago lol.  now, regarding fires list, what the fuck? lmao. IPman?? repbot???? orange???? snow? (rusty as fuck, nowadays) ffs fire. side note, i love duelling vamp and lestat, always very offensive oriented duels that end very quickly with lots of MA action. milk man is probably the most frustrating person to duel because his strategy consists of nothing else other than ""hide your feet"". also vamp is incredibly rusty these days because of triple whammy college/job/gf so gfg"
Tribes,3bjj9u,rtcll,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:47:05 2015 UTC,"lol. I used to mess with him because he was always mad and ready to argue. I don't hate they guy, I just love hating on him. Last time I dueled was against Rtcll and I went like 4:1~3:1 his favor. I'm not really a dueler I guess he said that just because of my potential 2 b deadly."
Tribes,3bjj9u,shadoh210,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:25:55 2015 UTC,I don't think I said stork is the next best after Izza. I'd say vamp but I didn't get to duel him so maybe snow
Tribes,3bjj9u,AFireInAsa,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:49:15 2015 UTC,o i should log in more to check my messages. i distinctly remember you saying that stork did the best against you of everyone you duelled :O but this was before you duelled either izza or vamp

Tribes,3bfsja,Dodgesabre,5,Mon Jun 29 04:37:30 2015 UTC,Is it even illegal in hirezs eyes? Modification of an ini file?
Tribes,3bfsja,Lazzirus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:17:39 2015 UTC,"I'm sure modification of the .ini file was always considered acceptable. But there's no way HiRez intended for that specific modification to be accessible.  Regardless of how a player accomplishes an ""ESP"" cheat...it's still cheating.   Furthermore, SultanFalls has been using infinite energy and aimbot with the pushback hitscan hack. So the whole ""it's just flash.ini"" argument is invalid."

Still looks a bit wild though. I figured they would use discs more often because of how slow the plasma is."
Tribes,3bilzh,persuasionlaser,7,Mon Jun 29 17:42:18 2015 UTC,"Plasma has a way higher rate of fire and is better for close mid-air engagements. You will probably see more plas in these duels because this map starts you on those big podiums. A lot of other maps start you on the ground and I think it would be a little different.  Izza is one of the best duelers of all time; probably the most dominate dueler for the longest period of time in T1 history. He controlled #1 on the duel ladder undefeated from 2004-2009 when it died. Dare is top 5 active dueler.  The two players with the highest peak dueling skills of all time are probably Izza and Rtcll. There was a lot of hype and trash talk between them both to duel this year, it was pretty much Mayweather vs Pacquiao because they were both far above everyone else and had never really dueled before. The fight ended up happening a few months ago and I won't spoil the results just in case the duels get posted here soon (I might just upload them myself; I don't like rawtpoker's config for watching duels because the weapon trails look funny).  Dueling in T1 is very skillful (they classic duel with Disc/Nade/Plasma, chaingun really makes it far less intresting). I can trash a lot of players and consider myself a pretty decent dueler, but up against players like Rtcll I can lose 40+ in a row without winning a single fight. That's how big the skill discrepancies are in this."

Tribes,3be0zk,pard0n99,6,Sun Jun 28 10:12:38 2015 UTC,I would not discount Hi-Rez based on that. Tribes had a strong fan base to start with. Plus a tried a true gameplay concept. Evolve it's a new IP with a new gameplay mode. Tribes was much harder to kill.
Tribes,3be0zk,Amuro_Ray,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:11:24 2015 UTC,"It was kinda similar to AVp where one person could be the queen vs the marines, or natural selection 1/2 where you would only have maybe 1 Onos vs many marines.

Tribes,3be0zk,NeoSniper,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:51:29 2015 UTC,I wouldn't compare it to natural selection. An onos can be killed pretty easily in some circumstances. That and it's heavily a team game rather than 1vs the rest

Got it day 1 as the deluxe for a reasonable price from Nuuvem, no regrets. The DLC talk was just terrible advertising on their part, the only dlc absolutely worth fussing with are the hunting passes with new characters. Their pricing on the first pass was a bit much though, but they've now lowered it by $10 which is much more reasonable especially during a sale. The PS4 version seems to have the most players by a long shot, and they've stated it's a permanent franchise so it's possible it will get new wings in the near future."

Tribes,3bb8yi,J4ckTh3Bl4ck,4,Wed Jul 8 17:39:37 2015 UTC,"Minimum entropy with 6 char with all ASCII printable chars (alphanumerical + symbols) is 956 = 7.35e+11  Now, you've said one must be a symbol (31 symbols) and one must be uppercase (27 uppercase letters), so with this restriction, the maximum entropy is now: 95*95*95*95*27*31 = 6.81e+10 or roughly an order of magnitude lower than no restriction. So while you forced the dude with ""password"" to change to ""Passw_rd"" you've significantly reduced maximum entropy.   Brute force got easier, but you think you've defeated dictionary attacks, right? Well, not really, because l33tspeak substitutions and trailing symbols (the common changes people make) are already accounted for in the dictionaries, and the cracking tools also offer brute-force subtition/appends on dictionaries where they aren't so they don't offer a lot...

Also, take 3 mins of the vid only to show previous footage was useless, even a bit irritating (Personnally I jumped to the actual new footage)  The worst thing imo is the time that it takes for every clip to show good stuff. I mean, we're almost waiting 10-20 seconds before anything happens ! Would've been much better to make it more fast paced, more synced with the song (Did not see a lot of syncing actually). A pass montage starts to be boring quite easily, you need to keep the viewer to the end, either by making the montage shorter (Not that hard, you only have to cut all the beginnings of the clips) or more synced, having both being even better.  Good luck in the future =)"

Tribes,3be6au,Achus619,3,Sun Jun 28 17:40:43 2015 UTC,"You see bud, first off you chose the wrong community to produce mid-to-low quality content for. The tribes people only expect the absolute best out every second they spend watching a youtube video, and if they think they're not geting it they will downvote your shit to oblivion.  In addition, you didn't take in any of the feedback you received in your previous thread. You even manage to put in more pointless sections of footage plus a freaking ""Previously, on pass...."" that doesn't help the flow of the montage in any way. Let alone the +1 minute intro. Also, it looks incredibly blurry for a 1080p video. You may want to look into other recording options if you wish to keep doing these.  I know it must have taken you a shit ton of time to put this together, but as long as you keep releasing this type of videos without any quality improvements people won't like. If that's ok to you, by all means, keep doing it. But if you want this sub to appreciate your work for once you'll have to try and change at least some of the things that the guys telling you."

Tribes,3b94ce,Grieves01,5,Sat Jun 27 02:05:22 2015 UTC,for now
Tribes,3b94ce,FeepFeepOG,4,Sat Jun 27 13:21:07 2015 UTC,"here's my take on it. GA2 was supposed to come out like 2 years ago but it didn't because Smite was doing too well. couple of months ago, someone on GA2 reddit met hirez at some event and they basically told him ""no plans for GA2 and they want to focus 100% on Smite since it is doing too well"". Now all the sudden this game is coming out. I think hirez is foreseeing a decline in Smite in 1-2 year time.  Smite is no longer #3 Moba in the world. Blizzard blew them from that spot already.  They are going to lose players to Gigantic for sure. They'll also lose a decent chunk to Overwatch as some of the folks will forget about Smite all together when Overwatch comes out. Then there is the fact that Battleborn is also coming out.  Smite has so many issues and all the sudden they can't get away with sidelining these issues because in 2015 there are actually buttload of games that people are really looking forward to try out!  Hirez also has sketchy ways of boosting twitch viewership and player account created...so I'm always skeptic to judge smite based on that. Regardless, it seems Smite is doing fine for now but I got a feeling that whoever is monitoring the numbers for Smite knows the game isn't going to last very long."

Tribes,3b94ce,IncognitoBadass,3,Sun Jun 28 03:59:58 2015 UTC,"Twitch stream auto plays in their official website or at least it used to for a very long time. It would be on top corner of the page and you might not even notice if you had it muted.  Stream auto ran for me multiple times within the game client.  They now spam smite client for every single SPL match. The announcement comes in the middle of the screen.  They have a referral skin. If 3 people you've referred play till they get to lvl 15 then you get a skin. Literally everyone i know in smite has an smurf. You pretty much have to coz you randomly get deserter and cant play for 30 mins.  Recently they introduced yet another referral skin which was met with much outcry in their own reddit. Its almost as if they want people to smurf.  I dont create smurfs. I dont havs one for tribes but ive smurf im smite. When i'm smurfing, i meet way too many people who're clearly smurfing like i am. I feel for those who are actual newbies and get paired with smurfs."

You really enjoy their music, start going to their shows, buying their albums and merch. But in every music store you visit, every venue you go to, there's a small group of people outside waving signs and yelling how bad the members of the band are and how they abandoned their previous venture.  To you, someone who simply wants to enjoy the music and is not interested in the history of the band members, these people seem whiny, annoying and irrational. If you were not such a nice person, you might even tell them to fuck off. But you don't. You put your headphones on and listen to some SMITE."

Tribes,3b94ce,BigMinnie,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:32:53 2015 UTC,Somebody from the tribes community managed to get Erez banned from reddit because he was begging for upvotes in exchange for teasers. This guy waited for months till Reffe said people should upvote a post so it gets some visibility in hopes of getting hirez to fix the server issues. He got Reffe banned as revenge.  If you check old threads on  /r/smite you will see a lot of hate towards tribes players who are just trying to warn the smite community of what will probably happen to the game once it stops being a cash cow.

For TV and TA they wanted to simplify it to make it more arcadey (t:v) and esporty (t:a) so they dumbed down that tactical gameplay for more skillful (aim skills) and player driver gameplay."

Tribes,3b4lhv,AFireInAsa,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:33:07 2015 UTC,"I guess the point is to have a good balance between an enjoyable game that is also decently popular. And that Tribes shouldn't be a too hardcore, niche game that is pretty unpopular, especially considering it is supposed to be a multiplayer game.  If not enough people play, it gets stale and most of the things you achieve seem to have less merit.  For instance, you can be a great speed runner but most people don't care because speedrunning is a somewhat small niche.  However, if you are a top cs:go or Dota player, that carries a lot more merit.  But, maybe it is more about having fun in a niche game and hoping it doesn't get stale or die.  But, you still need a certain amount of good players to have relatively exciting tournaments."
Tribes,3b4lhv,pard0n99,0,Fri Jun 26 21:36:14 2015 UTC,"Depends what one considers enjoyable. It's all about opinion and I like to think that there are lots of players who like it tad bit harder to learn. More rewarding imo.   T1 skiing isn't hardcore. It's definitely harder than it is in T:A, but what makes it more challenging is that most of the time you're skiing on terrain that wasn't created for skiing in the first place.   T:A used to have huge player base. It had moderately high competitive player base. It could've been better but HR decided to fuck things up with decision that broke the game. Regeneration, no fog and badly designed maps and broken spotting system were bad decisions to name few. Game was playable only because of countless band-aid fixes and tons of bans in high skill level game play.  HR tried to make the game noobie friendly and added tons of unbalanced weapons just for the sake of money grab. They lied to their community and that was pretty much the death of the game. It never made money for them really, but they never really tried. Well guess they did but they thought they knew better than people who had spend most of their lives playing Tribes games. Unfortunately they didn't.   Bottom line is that you can make noobie friendly garbage and it might live a year or two and make some money out of it, but it will certainly die fast. There is no depth once you surpass certain skill level. People still play T1 and after so many years they are still able to evolve.   Wonder how long would COD be alive if there wouldn't be a ""sequel"" coming out the next year..."

Everyone knows HiRez did a shitty job making TA and yet think it's some sort of industry standard. It isn't, in case you didn't get it.   Campaign, skins, actual physics, gamemodes, MMR, server tools. Out of this whole list the most frivolous addition is skins, but skins are a great way for players to look sw3g while playing. Everything else is just a way to create a strong base. Then you focus on bugfixes and finding more ways for players to interact and make sick shit. Playerbase will do all the work."

It's basically 90% stupid fucking memes, unfunny jokes and excessive editing and 10% actual content. How the fuck can people tolerate that kind of shit? Is it intended for teens with ADHD? I really feel like a small part of my brain has died after watching it all.  Getting back on topic, as already mentioned by /u/Martywah, asymmetric map design means CTF is not a good testing ground for this theory.  When it comes to TDM where both sides are on equal footing, I think the study done on UT2k4 applies. But since I can't access the full paper, I have no idea how, and if, they ran any control tests.  For example, it could be that due to map artwork, players were more easily able to distinguish blue targets than red ones from the background. Or maybe better players more often pick the red side than they do blue (would require a completely different psychological test)? What would happen if those same players were forced to play with team colors that are neither red or blue? How about having both teams have the same color and distinguishing enemies in some other way? What would the results be then?"

Tribes,3b4x4y,Meremothy,2,Sat Jun 27 05:41:07 2015 UTC,"There could be some psychology behind it.  Perhaps certain kinds of FPS players gravitate to one color or the other for whatever reason, and perhaps the personalities of the people who prefer red vs blue, or blue vs red, can give them an advantage.    I've read blue rooms will make people feel calmer and more relaxed, whereas a room with walls all painted red, can make people feel hot and aggressive.    Perhaps seeing a red player might subconsciencly want you to kill that person for some underlying psychology-based reason.    But, despite all that, Diamond Sword all the way!  I'd never play as a filthy-ass Blood Bird, even if they did have the advantage.  My hatred for BE is inexplicable to even myself.

Tribes,3b1gll,Dub_Heem,2,Thu Jun 25 08:40:10 2015 UTC,"In my experience, there are a few issues regarding getting hooked onto the edges of inventory stations and other people's shoulderpads. As I can tell, character model shoulderpads are slightly unhinged from the main body, leaving a small area where you may both get stuck AND gather some flight speed while mostly being stuck into the station or other people's shoulders. I suppose this issue derives from the fact that Hi-Rez wanted us to be unable to sit one on another's head. As you know, you normally just bounce off people's head and shoulders. So perhaps that capper struck that other player's shoulders? Furthermore, the person you bounce off likely needs to not be looking straight at you, but rather be at least 30 degrees sideways compared to your travel path."

Tribes,3azved,jesusboy76,7,Wed Jun 24 21:01:45 2015 UTC,"I both hated and loved rock bouncing.  It added a lot of fun and creativity to the game when it was discovered and opened up the ability to capture a flag a little bit more safely on maps that were far too open.  Like skiing in T1, I think Rock Bouncing has a place in the future of Tribes. If there is one :("
Tribes,3azved,CheezeCaek2,4,Wed Jun 24 22:33:11 2015 UTC,"I think it helped cappers in a game that is stacked against them. If TA had been properly balanced from the start, I think people would have hated it.  But this is coming from a chaser who thinks post-grab rock bounces are a crock of horse shit so take that with a grain of salt :).  People like things like beacon jumps in t1 though so who knows?"
Tribes,3azved,Zwitterions,2,Wed Jun 24 22:56:42 2015 UTC,"People like things like beacon jumps in t1 though so who knows?   Like you said, it's about balance. I would say chasers have the advantage in T1 and stop cappers more than cappers get home (both high level equal players). Beacon jumps give cappers another tool in their arsenal for avoiding chasers. At the same time, chasers can use them too so it adds two extra elements to the capper-chaser balance."
Tribes,3azved,AFireInAsa,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:49:53 2015 UTC,Beacon jumps are also very unlike rock bounces in many ways.  There is no such thing as a beacon jump where someone does a 130 degree bounce without losing any speed or health.  It just doesnt happen.  I would call them much more balanced than rock bounces.
Tribes,3azved,perroTW,2,Thu Jun 25 20:24:08 2015 UTC,I'm with you on that. Post-Bounces I've always argued against.
Tribes,3azved,CheezeCaek2,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:54:18 2015 UTC,I always thought no rock-bounce w/ flag would have been acceptable. The 350 front to front on tartarus would be a lot less horseshit if they deadstopped after grab

Tribes,3azved,Zwitterions,2,Thu Jun 25 02:20:22 2015 UTC,"Like skiing in T1, I think Rock Bouncing has a place in the future of Tribes.   I really don't think so. With a properly balanced game where sentinels aren't ridiculous, cappers don't have stupid grab speeds (no health regen mid route), and you can get up to speed faster with a disc jump, rock bouncing has no place. There are surely other interesting mechanics that can add to a new Tribes game to set it's mark that make way more sense."
Tribes,3azved,AFireInAsa,2,Thu Jun 25 08:56:20 2015 UTC,"the way I was seeing it implemented in the future is another addition of skill.  Instead of blindly bouncing off of every angle, there is an added skill level to it in terms of some sort of pack or button press that needs to be applied at just the right time in order to succeed on the bounce... otherwise you crater.  I do agree though that in its current iteration, it shouldn't exist in the next Tribes."
Tribes,3azved,CheezeCaek2,2,Thu Jun 25 16:53:43 2015 UTC,"Have to agree with Fire, it really doesn't belong in anything resembling it's current form in future games (assuming those games are well balanced unlike TA).  To put it really simply, rock bouncing isn't balanced.  It only ""belongs"" in TA because the whole game is full of horrible balance which is ""fixed"" by one bandaid on top of another bandaid on top of another bandaid.  The end result is pretty much a shitty game that we made ""work"" because tribes is so unique and the people who love the core of the series (FPSZ with skiing) needed to make it ""work"".  Rockbouncing is necessary in the face of no fog of war, shitty impulse jumping, weak active jetting, stupid OP snipers, etc.  How do you make it balanced for a future game?  Well, first you have to realize rock bouncing is grapple2.0 and come to terms with it being a horrible concept to begin with of course.  Next, you think about what makes the other basic mechanics of the game balanced.  Disc jumping is balanced because you gain speed but lose health (speed vs health).  Skiing is balanced because it takes time to build up speed (speed vs time), and to a lesser degree exposure to enemy fire through hang time between hills (speed vs health). You can go deeper and deeper into things like health kits vs regen and how one is balanced while one breaks the game, and on and on.  The main point though is rock bouncing should have a cost, either in lost speed or lost health related to the severity of the angle of the bounce and how fast you are hitting the surface.  Know what's great about balance, beyond the game simply working better for everyone?  It makes things like rock bouncing an active choice for a player.  Instead of it being something you HAVE to do, it is simply one of many options which all have pros and cons that must be weighed in the moment.  That ends up making the game more fun because it gives the player increased control through decision making, and it inevitably increases the skill ceiling of the game as well."

Tribes,3azved,hobowithabazooka,4,Thu Jun 25 14:10:24 2015 UTC,i dont really pay attention to T:A but rock bounces remind me a lot of beacon hopping. i think capper regenning mid-route is the main broken mechanic at play instead of cool stuff like this
Tribes,3azved,shadoh210,8,Wed Jun 24 22:05:41 2015 UTC,"If you couldn't regen during route no-one would ever cap the flag ever in T:A.  In fact, no-one would run routes.  They would just slide in with full health at 200 speed, grab the flag, chain whore everything that got near them, and right before they got sniped out they would punt it to the closest teammate.  Sounds like it could be an ok meta game, but it would definitely rip pathfinder capping.  Large maps like Kata/Perma would be terrible.  Offence couldn't disk jump to the other side of the map in fear of getting sniped out real easy before clearing anything."
Tribes,3azved,pard0n99,3,Wed Jun 24 22:46:58 2015 UTC,"hi. yeah TA is its own beast bro, im not here to be a zealot and say TA sucks and T1 is the greatest game ever. that all seems like such a waste of time to me lol. i think Tribes: Ascend is way better than 99% of FPS games, i just prefer t1 personally but i mean, everyone has their own tastes. the only argument i would care to make to someone like you who is clearly passionate about T:A, is that there should have been a greater deal of scripting/moddability to the game, T:A was way too locked down and that truly killed the games potential IMO. but, long live tribes. just removing regen from T:A would do absolutely nothing but probably break the game even further, i agree."

Tribes,3azved,pard0n99,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:00:43 2015 UTC,"well as you said theres standard bugfixing which is really best left to the community (see: Bethesda) but then look at a game like Reflex fps (/r/reflex) which just has the most minimal LUA scripting and see what it adds to a game....starsiege: tribes was ridiculously scriptable, and to a lesser extent so was tribes 2...thats how you get awesome stuff like lakrabbit. i think the community should be allowed to add to a game, thats what truly prolongs a games longevity. tribes 1 went into beta literally 17 years ago and its still being played, that would absolutely not be the case if it wasnt as scriptable as it is. maybe im biased but i really cant see people still playing tribes: ascend 15 years from now."
Tribes,3azved,shadoh210,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:06:37 2015 UTC,"It also opens the door to massive amounts of hacking, and you don't want that if the game is going to be an e-sport.  I think just the ability to make maps would have been fine, and the company actually fixing game breaking bugs.  More control over server settings.  Banning rage perk on sniper for instance is not possible, we just go by an honor code."

Tribes,3azved,pard0n99,2,Thu Jun 25 03:19:06 2015 UTC,"Beacon stopping was usually only one direction, though (up).  Rock bounces are pretty much any direction you want with literally no health or energy cost while retaining your original speed.  I suppose if I played longer as a capper my view would be different, but I think they're silly.  Had the game been designed a bit differently before and during beta they probably wouldn't have been brought back after Hi-Rez originally removed them (and the communities response...).  People comparing it to skiing is just...I don't even know how to describe it.  Whatever.  They got what they wanted I guess."
Tribes,3azved,evanvolm,3,Wed Jun 24 22:18:03 2015 UTC,"I wish it was any direction you wanted.  It is mostly a couple of directions that all suck/lose speed, and maybe one good direction that maintains speed.  A lot of rock bounces are bad or useless.  This one you see in the video is useless, you lose a lot of speed, some health, and prob get sniped out."
Tribes,3azved,pard0n99,6,Wed Jun 24 22:38:14 2015 UTC,"no, sorry fixious i love you but youre wrong...actually you really couldnt be more wrong, and hopefully someone who is really a pro at the game like rtcll can back me up but yeah you can absolutely control the direction of beacons 100% in T1 base. if you want to deadstop you can do this, if you want to launch at a 90 degree angle you can do this, 45 degree angle is doable easily, and anything in between as well but then you are getting into pro sperg territory   i am really drunk sry if this post is incomprehensible."
Tribes,3azved,shadoh210,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:41:38 2015 UTC,"nah it's good.  I just mainly see it used to go straight up or slghtly back, depending on the slope of the terrain.  or last night where someone beacon stopped on the broadside base and planted the flag there (lol).  they still aren't remotely as silly as rock bounces though."
Tribes,3azved,evanvolm,3,Thu Jun 25 02:13:17 2015 UTC,"yeah, most of the time beacon is like a panic button. but if you really plan ahead you can do a lot with them, which is why its nice that they are limited to 3. if beacons were unlimited i think people like rtcll would probably never die, heh"
Tribes,3azved,shadoh210,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:14:58 2015 UTC,"It isn't. Beacon jumps can be used by the capper and chaser and are far more balance then rock bouncing bullshit. There are no chasers in T:A because of cappers speed and even if they could keep up, you have shit like this."
Tribes,3azved,AFireInAsa,5,Thu Jun 25 08:52:17 2015 UTC,Rock bouncing is the best thing hirez did for the tribes series and of course they patched it out.  Only reason we have it now is because they fucked up the last patch then abandoned the game.

Notice how, except for what way the player is facing, hitting any* flat surface behaves the same; it's all just skiing (frictionless deflaction) with little or no speed loss if safe fall is equipped.  Edit: What is witnessed in the video is a double bounce; the surface of the cliff is not flat (more like this /--\ ), and the player has hit the right slant, deflected left, hit the left slant and deflected back. Some of the angles were large enough to cause damage and speed loss.  *some surfaces are fucked up because HiRez"

Tribes,3azved,prettzl,-10,Wed Jun 24 21:01:58 2015 UTC,"Rock bounces are just broken physics anyway and the way they are in T:A will hopefully never make its way in to another Tribes game. (Hopefully they'll be back with some realism accounted for.)  If you slam in to a potentially solid object going at 20kmh (Or, in typical cases in game, much much faster) and expect to go bounding off losing little/gaining speed at any angle other than a shallow dead stop directly in to the nearest gravitational pull then you're clearly not a fan of proportional negative and positive G forces, internal organs, and that an action causes an opposing and equivalent reaction, or (and this is the big one) friction.  That should have been a full momentum loss splat, even with safe fall.  Let's talk Sci-Fi though, maybe the suits of armor that Tribals wear accommodates for the sudden impact trauma with shields (I could buy that) but the sudden shift in trajectory would make even a jet fighter pilot pass out from a concussion since their brain is not likely encased inside their skull in something that negates fluid movement.  Then again rock routes prove that you don't need to have a brain in your head to survive bad physics.  Made parts that were already there bold to clarify how fucking retarded Dark Seed is. Completely unedited post otherwise."

Tribes,3azved,DarcseeD,4,Wed Jun 24 21:37:58 2015 UTC,"So should skiing have been removed from T1? Because that was only possible due to broken physics. Should bunny hopping have been removed from Quake? That too is only possible due to players exploiting the physics of the game engine.  Rock bounces made capping more interesting and varied, which in turn made SENs less powerful, which was good for the game as a whole.  Just because something isn't realistic doesn't mean it's a bad game mechanic. T:A is not a military simulator."
Tribes,3azved,prettzl,-3,Wed Jun 24 21:49:04 2015 UTC,"Are you suggesting that Rock Bouncing ""makes"" Tribes: Ascend the game that everyone expects to be playing when they play Tribes: Ascend the way that Skiing MADE T1?  Bunny hopping in quake was unintentional as well but the makers of idtech loved how much it added to their game that they made it easier to do thus improving quake as a series and it's player accessibility to the BASIC CONTROL FUNCTIONS by leaps and bounds.  If rock bouncing ends up being the same as it is in T:A now (in some future game) then the SENs of that future game will need to be adjusted to be MORE powerful to compensate for how broken rock bouncing is now. (Since it can make a chaser useless even if they were tryharding with rage/chain, gl keeping yourself close enough let alone going the same general direction to maintain solid accuracy when PZZZZJEW~ the capper suddenly goes underneath you and loses hardly any speed yet you're going the wrong way, might as well K out errtime.)  The more realistic a game plays at the fundamental level of control the more likely it will have a large number of players who excel at it.  More players = longer game lifespan.  Capping would have been a lot more interesting from the get go and also a lot more varied if the maps weren't surrounded by infinitely high walls that killed your speed."

Do you think that when players launched T1 for the first time they expected a game where they can ski around? They didn't, unless they knew about it beforehand.  So yes, I'm suggesting that you being against rock bounces is very similar to those people who thought skiing was stupid in T1.   Bunny hopping in quake was unintentional as well but the makers of idtech loved how much it added to their game that they made it easier to do thus improving quake as a series and it's player accessibility to the BASIC CONTROL FUNCTIONS by leaps and bounds.   How is that an argument against rock bouncing? If anything, it's an argument against Hi-Rez.   If rock bouncing ends up being the same as it is in T:A now (in some future game) then the SENs of that future game will need to be adjusted to be MORE powerful to compensate for how broken rock bouncing is now.   Of course a future Tribes game shouldn't adopt rock bouncing exactly how it works in T:A. Much like skiing in Tribes games that came out after T1 didn't work like it did in the original. But now you're arguing against the way rock bouncing should be implemented, not against the concept as a whole.  If a future Tribes game implements rock bouncing as a feature, rather than having it exist as a physics bug, then it would increase the skill ceiling of the game, making capping, sniping, chasing and flag defence in general more difficult. The bounce angle could be limited, for example to 90 degrees, thus removing the 180 degree bounces. Also, the maps would be designed (and perhaps later fixed/improved) with rock bouncing in mind.   The more realistic a game plays at the fundamental level of control the more likely it will have a large number of players who excel at it. More players = longer game lifespan.   This statement is simply incorrect. If it were true, why aren't the ARMA games the most popular games in the world? Or are you one of those people who think that player movement in CoD and CS is realistic?  And bringing it back to you seemingly being ok with bunny hopping in Quake and skiing in T1, how exactly were those mechanics realistic? In T1 you didn't have some special frictionless boots, you simply slid across surfaces because of a physics bug. Or in Quake, how is jumping around in a very specific manner, that exploits how the game engine works, realistic?  Do you think T1 and Quake would have been more popular games if those features had been removed, thus making how those games played ""at the fundamental level of control"" more realistic?   Capping would have been a lot more interesting from the get go and also a lot more varied if the maps weren't surrounded by infinitely high walls that killed your speed.   Again, this is not an an argument against rock bouncing, but against certain aspects of map design.

The current implementation of it being ""broken"" and suggesting it not be in future incarnations of Tribes games ""as it is now"" is somehow a big picture encompassing of Rockbouncing in general?   How is that an argument against rock bouncing? If anything, it's an argument against Hi-Rez.   Oh good, I thought I was alone in how much I think that Hi-Rez fumbled on Tribes: Ascend.  WHEW that is a load off my back.  And CoD and CS movement realistic? No, but easy to pick up and not difficult to master the mechanics of duck-jumping to gain extra height, nothing else about CS:GO's movement is advanced in any way. CoD no idea, wouldn't touch those games.   I'm suggesting that you being against rock bounces is very similar to those people who thought skiing was stupid in T1.   Your conclusion mat must have some deeply ingrained footprints in it.  Skiing not being something players expected after the first 8 months of it being in ""its complicated"" status then updating it's status to ""in a relationship with Tribes"" is one of the biggest reasons (via word of mouth between gamers) that T1 had as many players as it did/has now.

Rockbouncing is exclusively fundamental/essential to what calls itself the ""PUG/Comp"" community. These players will hopefully be overlooked and have no part in future Tribes style game development since they're all about eSports and narrow gameplay perspectives. Which leaves no room for creativity and demanding the game mode CTF be played in exactly one way instead of adapting to the developed game itself and making the most of what it is.

They even have booths at quakecon for how to learn to get around like ""everyone else does""- note that does not say ""get around like pros"", and they emphasize that too- that jumping and maintaining forward momentum is just a basic part of playing Quake and that by learning to walk in the game you need to learn how to hop around or you have not learned how to move.  I'm not even going to touch that weak argument calling Arma realistic.

This statement is simply incorrect.   Some day you'll understand that accessibility and expectations of the front end user is considered a ""realistic intuitive learning process"".  Did you know that Super Mario 3 teaches every single aspect of it's game mechanics before you've even gone 2 full screen lengths in to the first stage? You literally do not need to know anything else, it even teaches you how to CHANGE YOUR MOMENTUM WHILE JUMPING AND FALLING which is as advanced as that game's mechanics GET.  When someone picks up Tribes: Ascend there's only 3 hurdles to clear to learn the basic movement:   1 ) Understanding that gravity pulls you down slopes while skiing 2 ) Understanding that jetting fights gravity much more effectively as you pick up horizontal momentum 3 ) Running in to the ground and other things after a certain speed threshold makes you take damage   Rockbouncing negates one of the biggest fundamental building blocks of the FPSz movement style.  If running in to things doesn't hurt, why not just go as fast as you possibly can all the time and change your trajectory only with solid objects (including the fucking ground why don't we)? I do hope that a game like that gets made at some point for the niche that enjoys rockbouncing as is.  Rockbouncing for the ""professional sperg territory"" of players who think entirely too highly of their skill plateau is only in the game right now because the maps are all entirely too small for the speed with which is needed to be an PUG adequate capper (You gotta go fast- duh, 375+ or you're just not capping right) GOOD Cappers consistently hit 435+ and this is all relatively old information.  Know why nobody bothers with the old routes on maps that clipped just over 320 without rockbouncing? Well it's because the rockbouncing routes are not only easier to practice but they reach better speeds with the same amount of distance covered. Why bother learning routes and making routes that don't use terrain fuckery to confuse and ruin chasers? Let's all just make chasing a whole lot less effective, that'll make everyone think the game is harder because now we've made another role practically useless.  Fucking ban PTH then, SLD cap only. That'd BALANCE the game for sure. Just holy shit, you can't seriously believe that rockbouncing is anything but compensating for map size by squeezing the most efficient way to move around out of the minimum amount of space? Are you fucking kidding?  Additional: There is no such thing as a ""high skill ceiling FPS"" that term is just a way to say to new players ""well you just wont be good without practice"". New players never need their head pat to let them know that something is hard. Just let them experience it and fail, experience it and give up, or experience it and succeed to a point and give them an opportunity to grow as an individual. if there's a ""correct"" way to play a game then anyone who plays it long enough to master than fundamental mechanics will know it and be able to explain it in very simple terms.  ""To be good at tribes you need to be able to move around."" Not avoid getting shot, that hardly matters. Same with landing shots. Aim wasn't king in T1 nor T2, both were objective oriented team shooters with RTS live battlefield management elements that were unique to shooters at the time. The core concept that was abandoned and ignored all throughout development by HiRez and the popular vocal majority of the community at the time. But that's besides the point, this is about a bug, not why this game is bad.  This post is getting long and it's just going to be downvoted anyway.  TL;DR Fop off Rockbounce bleach drinkers, you literally have no place in the future of Tribes the way rock bouncing works right now."
Tribes,3azved,DarcseeD,2,Thu Jun 25 13:15:08 2015 UTC,"Clearly you know how to read, especially with all those quotes that you somehow took out of context.   I took absolutely nothing out of context. I quoted each and every sentence of your post in the correct order.   Having glanced through your reply, it's abundantly clear that you're the one who's cherry picking what points of mine to respond to and which ones to conveniently ignore, simply because you're unable or unwilling to counter my arguments. It's very annoying to have a conversation with someone who does this, so if you can, please do better next time.   When was I not arguing about how rockbouncing should be implemented? The current implementation of it being ""broken"" and suggesting it not be in future incarnations of Tribes games ""as it is now"" is somehow a big picture encompassing of Rockbouncing in general?   In your original post your whole point was pretty much ""rockbouncing is not realistic, ergo it's a bad game mechanic"". In your reply to me you did indeed specifically oppose rock bouncing ending up in future Tribes games as is, which is why I said that you altered your original argument. You can't just conveniently drop your original point that I opposed, because you're unable to defend it.   And CoD and CS movement realistic? No, but easy to pick up and not difficult to master the mechanics of duck-jumping to gain extra height, nothing else about CS:GO's movement is advanced in any way. CoD no idea, wouldn't touch those games.   You're not even countering my argument. I never questioned whether CoD or CS is easy to pick up. How about you quote the entire paragraph and respond to that, instead of trying to make some vague point that has nothing to do with the argument at hand?   Skiing not being something players expected after the first 8 months of it being in ""its complicated"" status then updating it's status to ""in a relationship with Tribes"" is one of the biggest reasons (via word of mouth between gamers) that T1 had as many players as it did/has now.

What has this got to do with our discussion? Simply making statements that have at most a weak tangential connection with the points I've raised is not how you engage in an argument, it merely makes you seem inept at making good counter points.   Rockbouncing is exclusively fundamental/essential to what calls itself the ""PUG/Comp"" community.   Care to provide any kind of an argument to back up this statement?   These players will hopefully be overlooked and have no part in future Tribes style game development since they're all about eSports and narrow gameplay perspectives. Which leaves no room for creativity and demanding the game mode CTF be played in exactly one way instead of adapting to the developed game itself and making the most of what it is.  New players reactions to seeing rockbounces for the first time range from ""hax"" to ""wow this game is broken"".   Seems to me that you're just bitter towards the comp/pug players for some personal reason and not even arguing against rock bouncing anymore.  Players who are good at the game and closest to the possible skill ceiling are in fact in the best position to provide critique and advice about a game with a high skill ceiling. A casual player, or someone new to a game, who doesn't have a good grasp of game mechanics, should only be looked at when it comes to advice about accessibility, not about in depth game mechanics.   ""I really like skiing."" Tribes Ascend Community 2012-20XX'   What quotes is that exactly and what does it have to do with any of the points I've made?   Also I'm pretty sure I told you in my previous post that idtech made the timing for rabbit jumping much more forgiving. They even have booths at quakecon for how to learn to get around like ""everyone else does""- note that does not say ""get around like pros"", and they emphasize that too- that jumping and maintaining forward momentum is just a basic part of playing Quake and that by learning to walk in the game you need to learn how to hop around or you have not learned how to move.   Which is why I said that a future Tribes game should have rock bouncing as a feature, not as a bug.   I'm not even going to touch that weak argument calling Arma realistic.

So pick some other game that you believe is realistic and exchange ARMA with that. Now counter the argument I made, instead of trying to avoid it, and prove your original point that ""the more realistic a game plays at the fundamental level of control the more likely it will have a large number of players who excel at it"".   Some day you'll understand that accessibility and expectations of the front end user is considered a ""realistic intuitive learning process"". Did you know that Super Mario 3 teaches every single aspect of it's game mechanics before you've even gone 2 full screen lengths in to the first stage? You literally do not need to know anything else, it even teaches you how to CHANGE YOUR MOMENTUM WHILE JUMPING AND FALLING which is as advanced as that game's mechanics GET.   So since a 2D platormer has game mechanics that are easier to convey than those of a niche 3D arena shooter with skiing and rocket packs, rock bouncing is bad? That's your argument? Really? You can't be serious.   Rockbouncing negates one of the biggest fundamental building blocks of the FPSz movement style.  If running in to things doesn't hurt, why not just go as fast as you possibly can all the time and change your trajectory only with solid objects (including the fucking ground why don't we)? I do hope that a game like that gets made at some point for the niche that enjoys rockbouncing as is.   No, rock bouncing doesn't negate anything, it adds to the possible movement mechanics a player can learn in order to add more variety to how they play the game. Much like skiing did for T1 and bunny hopping and rocket jumping did for Quake.  As I said in my previous reply to you, I'm not arguing for rock bouncing to be implemented into the next Tribes game as is. I'm arguing your original point that ""rock bouncing is not realistic, ergo it's a bad game mechanic"".   Rockbouncing for the ""professional sperg territory"" of players who think entirely too highly of their skill plateau is only in the game right now because the maps are all entirely too small for the speed with which is needed to be an PUG adequate capper (You gotta go fast- duh, 375+ or you're just not capping right) GOOD Cappers consistently hit 435+ and this is all relatively old information.   Yet again your displeasure with the comp scene is shining through. And again, this is not an argument against rock bouncing, but against the size of T:A maps.   Know why nobody bothers with the old routes on maps that clipped just over 320 without rockbouncing? Well it's because the rockbouncing routes are not only easier to practice but they reach better speeds with the same amount of distance covered. Why bother learning routes and making routes that don't use terrain fuckery to confuse and ruin chasers? Let's all just make chasing a whole lot less effective, that'll make everyone think the game is harder because now we've made another role practically useless.   Can you please take a step back and realize that you're not making any statements against rock bouncing and instead are being critical (and rightfully so) of T:A's map design?   Additional: There is no such thing as a ""high skill ceiling FPS"" that term is just a way to say to new players ""well you just wont be good without practice"". New players never need their head pat to let them know that something is hard. Just let them experience it and fail, experience it and give up, or experience it and succeed to a point and give them an opportunity to grow as an individual. if there's a ""correct"" way to play a game then anyone who plays it long enough to master than fundamental mechanics will know it and be able to explain it in very simple terms.   Yes, there is such a thing as a ""high skill ceiling"". It means a game has mechanics that are difficult to master. And if rock bouncing is implemented well into a future Tribes game, all of this would apply.   ""To be good at tribes you need to be able to move around."" Not avoid getting shot, that hardly matters. Same with landing shots. Aim wasn't king in T1 nor T2, both were objective oriented team shooters with RTS live battlefield management elements that were unique to shooters at the time. The core concept that was abandoned and ignored all throughout development by HiRez and the popular vocal majority of the community at the time. But that's besides the point, this is about a bug, not why this game is bad.   Yet another paragraph that doesn't even mention rock bouncing and is instead critical of other game design decisions Hi-Rez made with T:A.  TL;DR: You first said rock bouncing is bad because it's not realistic. Now it seems you're arguing that rock bouncing shouldn't be implemented into future Tribes games in the same way that it works in T:A. Those are two very different arguments. On top of that you've sprinkled a whole myriad of critique towards Hi-Rez and their game design decisions that have nothing specifically to do with rock bouncing as a possible game mechanic in future Tribes games."

Then after your second post it became clear it's almost impossible to even try to point out how wrong you are because of how absolutely retarded your argument actually is.  For you to be able to maintain your stance in the discussion you just kept quoting things and also changing the meaning of them in order to what? I don't even know exactly, you were trying to invalidate my perspective or- fuck- what WERE you trying to do anyway? Just fill empty space with a needless critique of what I said?  The misappropriation of something said is also a quaintly lowbrow way to deflect an argument into something that detracts from the actual conversation- so as a result is a method used to try to recover a usually unwinnable situation in which one person is most likely right and the other is wrong.  Guess who is wrong.  Go on, have a guess.  My very first post:   Rock bounces are just broken physics anyway and the way they are in T:A will hopefully never make its way in to another Tribes game.   Your final attempt at a lucid response to several convoluted quote bloated micro critiques.   TL;DR: You first said rock bouncing is bad because it's not realistic. Now it seems you're arguing that rock bouncing shouldn't be implemented into future Tribes games in the same way that it works in T:A. Those are two very different arguments.

My very first post: [quote from post]   That's only the first paragraph of your post and a small part of it. In the rest of it you argued that since rock bouncing isn't realistic, it's a bad game mechanic. That's the point I argued against and that's the point you were unable to defend.   You are a fucking idiot.   You really don't have to get angry.  I'll try to reiterate my stance on the whole rock bouncing thing in a concise list:   I don't think rock bouncing should be in a future Tribes game if it works like it does in T:A. I do think rock bouncing made capping more fun and varied in T:A and would have been even better if Hi-Rez had fixed the maps that allowed for overpowered rock bounces (180's, return routes that were too fast, etc). I also do think that if implemented well (limitation on max bounce angle, maybe a small speed decrease, maps designed with rock bouncing in mind, etc) rock bounces would be a welcome addition in a future Tribes game, because they add more tools to the cappers arsenal. Finally - I don't think a game feature should be removed simply because it's unrealistic. This is the reason why I responded to you in the first place."

Tribes,3azved,thynnmas,2,Thu Jun 25 01:39:25 2015 UTC,"You're confusing predictability and or intuitiveness with realism.   Are you trying to imply that DOTA (and LOL and CS) are intuitive or predictable? How about I jump-scout you while blinking 900 instead of 1200 units...  And I've said this before, but I'll say it again: Rock deflection is perfectly intuitive, it's just skiing. The only thing differing a turret ""bounce"" from the tower route on kata is the perspective...  Edit: Rock bounces are as deterministic a floating point based physics engine is going to get, but I will agree that the physics meshes not matching rendering meshes makes it difficult to predict a bounce unprepared. Luckily, decals are painted on the physics mesh, meaning the explosions from discs etc. let you see the surface you will be deflected along, allowing you to perfectly predict a bounce if you want to."

Tribes,3auvfy,t3hcoolness,3,Wed Jun 24 01:47:20 2015 UTC,"I played the alpha a bit. Surprisingly solid controls, although it seems like most weapons without AoE, scattershot, or homing just aren't viable with how fast the maneuvering is. Capture the flag in planes seems really cool just from trying out routes and stuff, but I never found an actual server that wasn't just ignoring flags and playing TDM. I would assume that has changed with the full release."

That shit was awful but the kill totals were pretty high at least.  Edit: I found it! http://www.twitch.tv/tribesascend/b/369259298  The shitty one I mean haha.  Winters really helped keep the cast interesting in the OT  The last play starting at 54:15 (vod time) is pretty exciting.  Edit 2: lol these kill totals http://i.imgur.com/E3rsQ8V.png  Would be so much higher on any other map.

Semifinals Map 1 is Midnight Mayhem Delux, which has a partially indoor (and easy to defend) Flag. We went to 3 overtimes the first night (30 min each), and then had to reconvene the following day where it took until midway through overtime 6 for a cap to happen and move on to Map 2. In all we played 3 hrs , 15 minutes on that map over a 2 day span... to get 1 cap. (we lost that cap also, but won maps 2 and 3)."
Tribes,3ar0fx,Mindflayr,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:24:13 2015 UTC,That sounds fucking terrible.  Especially considering it ended in a loss but at least you all took the series.  I would have been pissed if we lost that game.
Tribes,3ar0fx,Zwitterions,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:26:00 2015 UTC,"about 10 minutes before they got that cap (at the start of round 6 of OT a few members suggested throwing the map just to get on to ""something fun"". We didnt agree to do it, but its possible some of our D let it get out just to get to map 2.     As Much as people complain about Epi and Robo-Defense in T:A, Tribes 2 Took the cake for the ability to play lockdown D with 2 types of deplyable turrets, 5 interchangeable Barrels on Fixed Base turrets, Sensors to catch the cloackers, and of course the ability to actually Chase Caps. In T2 classic because we sped up the game so much it wasnt too bad, but in Tribes 2 Base mode 5150 didnt give up a single Cap for like 4 months of matches. When a team finally capped on them it was considered a milestone. Then they Lost a single map of 3 in a match and it was even bigger news. You can hear both of those moments in this Epic Montage made by my buddy TTHREAZ: Farewell T2 which is the best tribes video ever to feature no actual video of tribes."

I know some people didn't like him but you can't argue he didn't bring excitement to the cast. Also like the macgyver'd player cam. I can't help but think it would have become more popular from a viewing perspective if someone who didn't know anything could focus on an individual player with a proper player cam instead of watching what appears to be a bunch of ants skirmishing around. Subsequently the player base probably would have grown. Oh well."
Tribes,3ar0fx,duhlitz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:47:49 2015 UTC,"There weren't very many good camera men, and that was really the crux of the bad casting across the board imo. You could easily snap from player to player before the good plays happened if you knew what you were doing and what players to look out for . Problem was, the only people capable of doing that properly were usually playing."
Tribes,3ar0fx,duhlitz,2,Mon Jun 22 22:01:34 2015 UTC,"Yup, a true first person cam and some info overlayed on the screen would have been nice too. I'm talking about more than just the score.

Fucking Hi-rez happened.

How was it to get to meet your teammates in person and have you ever met them again since?  (or any other tribes players).  Did you think the game would start to take off after that event (well maybe you already answered that one haha).  This is not trolling btw I'm legitimately curious.  You were one of my favorite players to watch because you seem to be one of the more controversial/ unorthodox people.  Always interesting haha.  And you used to play Legions right?  Any plans on playing again?  Pugs are actually very alive on the weekends lately and we all know how much better that game is :)"
Tribes,3ar0fx,JohnShazbot,5,Tue Jun 23 04:41:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the kind words . I don't get that enough around here :)   What was it like to play in front of that many people?   At first I thought it might have been a factor since I've never played at LAN before, and I'd be lying if I said there wasn't a ton of pressure even if I put it on myself. However I was more concerned with the Tribes players watching from home, the tribes community was who I wanted to impress. The rest of the viewers that were there live were all there for Starcraft 2 and we were more of a side show, so while we did entertain them and I could feed off their energy a bit I more or less tuned them out 5 minutes after map 1. By map 2 , mentally, I might as well have been in mumble.   Fun fact, my mic didn't work for all of map 1. I was the main capper and screaming at the top of my lungs over the crowd, my team, the other team it was pretty insane. I thought I was going to lose my voice, but we were able to fix comms just in time for map 2 in which we got 5-0'd and I spent the entire time between maps yelling at ZP. My only melt down, lasted 30 seconds.    How was it to get to meet your teammates in person and have you ever met them again since? (or any other tribes players).   It was a mixed bag ranging from meh to awesome. We all met up in the hotel lobby waiting for bart to direct us to our rooms, there was some banter, not much. I remember APC coming in, eyeing Projectile up and down and saying ""wow man, you really are jacked"" .   APC always good for the giggles. Everyone on both teams I think were genuinely excited just to be there and promote tribes to the masses on the biggest stage available. There was mutual respect between the teams for sure, we all had dinner together the night before and several of us drank and partied in the hotel lobby. In fact, I didn't get to bed until 3:30 am, I don't think Bojinglebells went to bed and we had to be at the venue at 10 am so it was pretty wild. I think I was introduced and had a small conversation at some point with pretty much every member of both teams, some better than others.   I've also met several other tribers in real life, redneck, prismbreaker, and others. Everyones always chill.    Did you think the game would start to take off after that event    I hoped it would. I did everything I could, for better or worse to make that happen. I tried to get my team sponsored, I tried to be the best so that I could be there at the grand finals to make it exciting. I think I knew deep down it was a sinking ship, but I didn't want to admit it. If you read my post history on my older accounts you'll see I went from die hard supporting hi rez, to being bitter as fuck. I went all in and sank with the ship , but hey it was fun.    And you used to play Legions right? Any plans on playing again?    Yes.

Single Most Insane ""Cap Denial"" in the History of Tribes (imo) that was captured in the Montage/Movie Pure2.   Short (Long)Backstory: 5150 was #1 team at end of T1, and Held #1 from T2s Launch until they retired at 15-0 having defended #1 4 times from Vanguard. Then Vanguard inherits the top spot and holds it until they retire @ 21-4 (Base: 9-4, Base++: 12-0) including 3 Defenses of #1 vs Rapture . Then Rapture takes over and Holds #1 through the end of Base++ (8-0) and goes 9-0 to start off the Classic ladder before this match.      Why is this important... because Invictus Aeternum is formed by a group of returning Vanguard Players who added other top talents to fill in for their fallen bretheren. At the time of this match (2/14/2003) the #1 Spot had Never changed hands since the T2 Comp ladder launched (May 2001) other than when the top team retired. Over 250 tribals tuned in to Watch/Listen to it (I cant remember if we had T2TV yet, or just used the Winamp Shoutcast Plugin to Listen to the cast). I was one of them, and it was epic."

The stuff that isn't written down anywhere but will be passed down to the new generations by word of mouth.  The stuff of legends man :).  Also I just remembered I played with a player (Scythebearer, you hear his name a few times) from that match in the first draft tournament for TA.  It was basically my only experience with competitive tribes for a long time but it was a blast.  Such a great team too, I think we got 3rd place.  Anarchy (captain), Fire, Alakabon, Hydroxide, Clownboat, LeScythe, Dragoneb, Aeia, Myself (different name at the time but I was the capper).  You could have made a legit comp team with those players haha.  I feel like I'm forgetting someone hmm..  Whoever it is I'm sorry.

Aside:  That wasn't actually CB, it was someone else from the old T2 days but I'm blanking on who.  I actually originally teamed with CB in late 2001 with Sapphire Blade (S|B).  Was a fun time getting to compete again even it was just for fun.

Tribes,3ar0fx,JohnShazbot,2,Tue Jun 23 04:50:56 2015 UTC,"Fiyaaa.  I'm geeking out pretty hard with this story but I'll tell it anyway.  During that draft tourney someone was telling a story about how they were capping against you.  You had gone out wide to spot cappers, only this time you were just standing there.  Not shooting, not even moving, just watching  They come over a hill and see you in the most unexpected place, just standing like a statue or the fucking slenderman.  Then you k'd out and conc'd them on the stand or something.  Imagining their terror in that moment has always made me laugh for some reason.  See ya around in Legions sometime :)  (It seems I've been treating this thread as my own personal nostalgia trip and to subliminally plug Legions haha.  I'm da bess.)"
Tribes,3ar0fx,Mindflayr,2,Tue Jun 23 05:32:43 2015 UTC,"I didn't just spot cappers, I would hunt for cappers with low health after they djed the first time. If I could even put a ping of damage on them, it could fuck up their regen time and they'd hit the stand before or while regening. If I k'd out, it's probably because they already gained their life back and I wouldn't be able to put sufficient damage on them in any way so it would be just better to try to stop them on the stand.  I guess that's way less of a cool story, though."
Tribes,3ar0fx,wordthompsonian,2,Tue Jun 23 05:38:46 2015 UTC,Oh yeah I get why you did it.  It's just funny because that particular time you seemed to just be watching them and they were genuinely frightened by it.  Like they considered K'ing out right then and there and starting a new route just because you had seen them and you knew that was all you had to do.  That's how I imagined it anyway haha.

Thinking about it, it was kind of a natural progression in that S|B had their server which was for up and coming players similar to how Rapture East was for the top level comp players.

Tribes,3ar0fx,alphageek8,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:28:54 2015 UTC,"The comp match between VeX and DeadStop is probably my favorite.  Buhlitz, who essentially created DS, got kicked off of his own team.  Then he formed VeX, and not only did they beat DeadStop, but VeX beat DS with an O-Stack, which was basically never done in a comp match until that very match; and they won against a hardcore D-stack.  So, to see Buhlitz get revenge & Vex being a HUGE underdog, and all the drama involved, and seeing a D-stack (which are so damn boring to watch) get whooped by an O-stack (something unheard of at the time), made the match worthy of an Oscar.  Plus Craig's awesome camera work and the commentating was good, and the entertaining chat on Twitch was the icing on the cake."

Could find decent routes for each T:A map with no problems at all. Finding routes on T1 maps is like art. Anyone can go and try that on Spincycle. Most T:A cappers would trash their screen in less than 30mins of trying. Not even kidding. T:A was one of the easiest FPS+Z game for me to learn.   Aiming wouldn't be a problem because most people play other games and have mechanical skill already build in. Most problems would be caused the load outs and perks. I never got over the fact that if you pick a certain load out, you are limited to do only few things in a comp match. There was certain situations where you felt useless because of the load out you had chosen. In T1 you were able to be there for you team no matter the situation was. Naked load outs were able to trash bases, chase, def and cap. Was a lot harder but you could do it.   T:A also has broken spot system and no fog. T1 doesn't have flag indicators and have fog everywhere. T:A players wouldn't be able to follow cappers. T:A in other hand has everything that would be considered unfair advantage in T1 like happyflag and nofog hacks.   Getting down voted for this by butthurt T:A players, but doesn't really matter. Prove me wrong instead and go play T1. It's free. See how easy it is to get used to with all the tribal warrior skills you have build playing T:A."

That's a hypothetical team of course because that group would never play with each other due to drama issues. In T1, T:A players wouldn't even cross midmap with the flag and it would be capout shutout in about 4 minutes each map.  In T:A, rtcll was the only one on that list with comp experience. I played one match in the NASL and then didn't touch the game for a long time. But combined we have over 60 years easy of tribes experience. Maybe we sneak a cap here and  there and put up a fight defensively. Doubt we would win but we would have the real tiebreaker which is caps for total."

Tribes,3aqu8p,Meremothy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:57:34 2015 UTC,"It's obviously time dependent as well. 2 minutes in and it's probably not the best choice. That said, I definitely saw the more defense oriented teams (mono iterations, zfz, epi) pull that kind of thing with 10 minutes left to play on maps.   You were always of an ""offense first, everything else comes later"" kind of guy (which I agree with) but it doesn't mean other options weren't available"
Tribes,3aqu8p,leukos,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:14:46 2015 UTC,"I guess I am a little biased here, and sure we definitely saw teams do it from time to time. Even then, I'd argue that it was rarely if ever the most efficient way to close a game out. I'd argue that in most cases it's not even a safe way to do it. That's the beauty of competition, everyone got their chance to do it 'their way'."
Tribes,3aqu8p,Meremothy,2,Tue Jun 23 15:50:22 2015 UTC,"To me in the EU scene it always felt like T:A rewarded the defensive team more, as in the team that would dedicate more than 3 players on defense.  Assuming Team A plays 4D/3O and Team B plays 2D/5O the extra added defensive player adds more to team A's defense, than the extra added player to team B's offense. I know this is map dependant and T:A player allocation(and it's impact) isn't as rigid as it sounds, but in general that was always something I noticed.  Team A's extra defensive player would add another early-offense killer, spotter and most importantly: respawner. I know 5O can throw alot more variation in their attacks than 3O or 4O but in the end the stand needs to be cleared, which that extra defense player makes so much harder.  But the biggest difference is how Team B's defense would crumble. Due to T:A's class system the HoF, SEN and LD have specific roles which do not overlap much. With that I mean that if Team B would put one of those 3 on offense, there would be a hole in the defense which a semi-competent 3O can quite easily take advantage of.   But that matchup is quite unlikely and usually is only used towards the later minutes of a match when a team is losing. But it shows how the game itself can prevent comebacks.  A regular 3D/4O would have less trouble with 4D/3O but it would make the game increasingly boring. (especially for offense)  In the end of the day, I wasn't involved with the NA scene and it's meta at all thus this could be a difference in meta between EU/NA."
Tribes,3aqu8p,Mindflayr,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:59:12 2015 UTC,You make a lot of good points. However its worth noting that any combination of strategies is highly dependant on so many factors. Namely chemistry. Map Pool. Individual players strength and weaknesses. When VEX went Full 5 O it worked because we formed the exact roster to make it work. Extremely flexible calm defenders. Three cappers who flex as clear and offensive killers who figit. Without those exact players it just never worked quite the same.   Id say that NA meta typically favored defensive teams as well and I think I did a good job of showing a reliable way to beat a stubborn D stack. With all things relative equal if an offense has more bodies alive and in position the flag will move. Every single active Team lost to VEX at least once while playing 5o. So id say proof is in the pudding. And while Epi had some success it wasn't reliable or consistent. The only other defensive oriented team to have reliable success was MME for a brief period of time. However most of their success came from a standard 4/3. The teams with tighter offense pressure typically had more consistent tourament victories where as defensive teams like Triumvirate/Nv/Zfz saw only brief or singular moments of success. Like I said I am bias but the stats make me comfortable saying offense leaning strats saw more consistent success.
Tribes,3aqu8p,MadWlad,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:17:26 2015 UTC,"Oh, don't get me wrong. I know there are tons of other factors involved which decide how well teams will perform in offense or defense. I just used 2 fictional teams as examples without any specifications on qualities to try portray how T:A mechanics affect the tactics and player allocation in offense and defense. It would be impossible to create an analysis of how T:A promotes the stacking of O or D if I had to factor in every detail.   On VEX's 5o: You make it sound like VEX went 5o in reaction to dstacks, was it like that? Did VEX also play 5o against 3d/4o teams?  Honestly, I'm curious. I've always been quite pessimistic on NA meta and tactics, knowing more about it (even so long after) could change that."
Tribes,3aqu8p,StorkSooFly,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:26:52 2015 UTC,Much in the same way a 4o/3d would occasionally make a shift in composition 50 would do the same.  And yes we created it to discourage D stacking which was the current meta. After 5o swept the twl ladder and natl s1 everyone went back to play mostly standard.   The whole reason deadstop voted for 7 on 7 was to avoid more defensive games on average. Some.teams though TDM while playing the flag occasional was cool but viewers dwindled hard during that phase. Rose by 3x on average every time vex played.   It was equal parts calculated risk taking and unrelenting pressure. Add in flexibility and trust and you can run any composition.

Tribes,3aod6k,pard0n99,21,Mon Jun 22 04:19:30 2015 UTC,"I find this to be a really interesting, drama filled, shit post; so lets have at it; Is T:A the worse iteration; easiest version of the Tribes series?   what is this punctuation  you can't really classify it as a kiddie game based on skiing alone. it's a polished game in that aspect. the skiing mechanic was harder in old tribes games because it wasn't polished. there's no way t1 jumping skiing is more natural/nicer-feeling than smooth skiing like in t;a, t;v, or legions."
Tribes,3aod6k,qhp,-2,Mon Jun 22 06:54:06 2015 UTC,"You say polished as though the skiing was not correct in T1 and T2. First off, skiing was an accident by the developers in T1. Once T2 came around they made skiing a tad easier, but not too easy. The skiing system in T2 was improved but purposely left to be a little difficult. This allowed for the separation between an average player and an excellent player. You actually had to be skillful at skiing.  With TA, it's too easy and everyone can be very good at it from the very beginning.   So, it would be called ""overly-polished"" in keeping with your terminology"
Tribes,3aod6k,limerences,15,Mon Jun 22 14:15:07 2015 UTC,"With TA, it's too easy and everyone can be very good at it from the very beginning.   I think we just disagree on this. Personally, I don't see an issue with this. There's no reason to make a core mechanic of the game difficult for the sake of being difficult. Besides, there's still something to master. It's not as if pressing the spacebar will immediately make you ski like a champ. Here's an example from a capper's perspective: you'll notice that even though skiing is easy to be ""very good at from the very beginning"" that the best cappers (top 3 at any point) in T:A were leagues ahead of everyone else in terms of how much speed they could milk from even the same setups."
Tribes,3aod6k,qhp,4,Mon Jun 22 17:30:21 2015 UTC,What made T1 skiing difficult in comparison were the super powerful jetpacks and no air control. This made routes 10x as hard imo since there is significantly less room for error. Coming from someone to someone who caps I know you are aware of how easy it is to ad lib routes. I won games ad libbing routes at a competitive level and it was fairly easy in TA largely due to the air control.   So it wasnt difficult just for struggle sake. There is just a significantly steeper curve with less room for error. Thats pretty much the entire argument for most all differences in difficulty concerning tribes. Physics is the core of all issues.
Tribes,3aod6k,duhlitz,7,Mon Jun 22 18:11:38 2015 UTC,"Coming from someone to someone who caps I know you are aware of how easy it is to ad lib routes. I won games ad libbing routes at a competitive level and it was fairly easy in TA largely due to the air control.   I think comparing T:A and T1 in this aspect is just goes down to opinion again. Personally, I don't see an issue with what you're describing. I don't think it makes gameplay more simplistic, just different. Actually, I might even go as far as to say that being able to dynamically create routes, or change them mid-route, adds difficulty (or at least adds more elements that separate the great players from the just OK players).   So it wasnt difficult just for struggle sake. There is just a significantly steeper curve with less room for error.   The difference with error between T1 and T:A, at least from what I can gather, is the difference between being unable to run a route at all (T1) and being slower (T:A). All this does is make it easier for new players to start playing T:A, since even if they make mistakes (and they will make mistakes), they can still complete an objective, just be doing it less ideally (slower, less energy, more visible, etc). Again this is matter of opinion, but I think that lowering the barrier to entry for movement, especially in a game with relatively advanced movement mechanics like the Tribes franchise, is a great thing. Especially when you can still see disparity among cappers who have practiced enough to know how skiing works.  I guess what I'm saying is that yeah, T1 had harder difficulty to be* even remotely competent, but that's not necessarily a good thing. T:A has an easier time with players being remotely competent, but the difficulty scales fast and the difference between a pubstomper and a top competitive player is huge, and shows that the game still has plenty room to be difficult/complex.  I'm not disagreeing with your logic or point of view, I just think we feel differently about the issue.  e: be"

I don't think that is a matter of opinion at all. I think this is spot on, and entirely accurate and perfectly sums up and answers the question of this thread fairly well.   Since the question was is T:A the kiddie version? We just had a conversation about T:A's training wheels. At least , that is the way I'm reading it.   I don't doubt that T:A has the ability to produce a wide variety of skill, I mean that spectrum has msstar at one end and me at the other. Even among top skill there are huge disparities across the board, that in my opinion comes down to decision making and game IQ and you can find that in every tribes game imo. The intrinsic qualities of tribes games produce this since the meta game for any tribes game is always relatively similar (chasers, stay at home, llama grabs, chain caps, etc it's all there). At least in my experience playing T1/T2 , T:V comp/Legions Comp/T:A comp.   I would just say that T:A holds your hand significantly more than any other tribes game, the game even holds the TEAMS hand in comp with pre built classes sort of building your composition for you. Tribes ascend from the very beginning was about trying to stream line the ""tribes experience"" , which I think they did a fairly good job. However in doing so, lowered the skill ceiling across the board for pretty much every aspect of the game from dueling, to sniping, to even forming tactics and strategy. Jesus, spotting and spawning in loadout alone really made things significantly easier for a new tribes player trying to understand comp."
Tribes,3aod6k,duhlitz,3,Mon Jun 22 19:16:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think that is a matter of opinion at all.   That part is not a matter of opinion, what is a matter of opinion is what follows from it.  First of all, maybe my definition of what we're calling a kiddie game is different from everyone else's, since it's a pretty ambiguous term to begin with. I think, in general, when we say ""kiddie game"" we're talking about mechanics being dumbed down to the point where they could be mastered by a kid with very little gaming experience. Note that I do not think that ""kiddie game"" means that the game is easier to pick up or start learning, but specifically to master. More specifically, the climb to the ""skill ceiling"" of the game is short, and can be done very quickly/easily.  This is certainly not the case in T1, where it's hard to have control of even the most basic aspects of the game. In T:A, it is easy (or at least, easier) to ski to the point where you are maintaining/gaining speed in standard situations. I would like to point out, though, that a chief complaint of new players to T:A (and Tribes as a whole) is that the game is very hard; a combination of projectile weapons, skiing, and faster targets makes new players to the franchise feel overwhelmed with new mechanics to understand/learn. And that's in the easier game. From there, though, T:A's mechanics aren't easy to master. Compare most level 50 players to top competitive players. For a specific example, compare someone like OOO4 to mstarr. OOO4 has certainly played more T:A than mstarr, but mstarr is infinitely better than OOO4 at duelling. Better yet, compare OOO4 to someone like Matin, since they're in the same role. OOO4 has capped more flags in T:A than anyone else, but is nowhere near Matin's level of skill when it comes to running routes. This shows that there is certainly something to master in T:A, and it's not easy to attain (playtime alone doesn't cut it) even with the easier/dumbed down mechanics.  I guess an apt comparison would be comparing DotA 2 to WC3 DotA. DotA 2 is much easier to pick up for new players. There are integrated player guides, in-game tutorials, great customization and control changes. That said, no one thinks that DotA 2 is an easy game, at least at the top level. It's not a kiddie game, even when compared to its harder predecessor. It's easier to pick up, but that doesn't make it an inherently easier or less intricate game."

Imo, HotRodRe is by far the best example of this, Diplodocus and a few others were able to attain an insanely hi level of decision making with around 1/10th the play time as other hi level players. That's usually because they played previously tribes though. Players like Soni/Tasty really had to put in the hours to get mechanically on the same level and I'd argue even still don't possess the same decision making as someone like HotRod.    It's easier to pick up, but that doesn't make it an inherently easier or less intricate game.   I'd agree this statement is true, but I'd have to page mabel or someone more technically articulate to explain in detail how the dumbing down of T:A did make it less intricate.

Tribes used to be more complex with objectives that often directly impacted if a flag would move or a capper got their loadout (the base mattered), support roles mattered because power mattered to every player, and often a base had more than one power source, adding to the complexity. Tribes wasn't supposed to be a one man show, hence it's name. It was more than dueling or capping, the meta was simply deeper than that. Tribes had huge (and by huge I mean you could get lost) and small maps, not just small to medium maps, it also had maps with flags indoors and/or elevated significantly, some required llama grabs preferably with a heavy that would toss it out and a light capper took it from there. Some maps had powered shields to limit flag access, adding to the overall meta.  It was much more adaptive, K out for example, was often a strategic decision not a given...a chaser may be better off staying forward and doing some LO if the assigned LO was spawning in a powerless base or due to map size and time travel back to O position.   Tribes had different modes and mods and grew comp from popularity, there were all sorts of ladders, not just one. Tribes grew from it's ability to give all sorts of players the game they wanted to play. TA was designed with the mindset it was an esport first before it even knew what it was and which also limited or complicated its ability to expand and gave the whole game a feel of exclusion with whitelist servers and counsels and 3rd party communications, a complete reversal of how comp grew in previous games that also  complicated map making which TA was already anemic with when it came to maps. Ironically even with such focus HiRez was still unable to connect the dots with it's comp community.   TA's lack of maps (not to mention lack of variance in maps) make it more ""kiddie-like""...it's depth is reduced in an attempt to make every map fit the same reduced egocentric meta primarily consisting of duel and cap and lacking any real support roles of value.  Kiddie is just an inciting choice of wording, it's more negative than saying simplified or limited. At least that's how I'd interpret it....I would not say it is easier, that would depend on your role and perspective. It is easier to snipe due to lack of fog and smaller maps, it is easier to auto due to it's lack of spin up and spread and prolific number of autos, it is easier to ski, yes, but skiing is now fundamental like running or jumping, why should that be a challenge really? Easier to cap...yes and no, autos and nitrons and snipers are now easier too, while in the past the stands were less open and protected etc. I will say it feels smaller as a game, much smaller in every way, like Tribes Super Lt."

Ascend has a much simpler skiing mechanic, which was admittedly introduced in Vengeance.  It has a very forgiving health regen mechanic (at least Legions had some limitations regarding regen).  There are a lot more weapons that provide higher DPS (i.e. more rifles), while T1 focused more on projectile-based weapons (though the chain is pretty deadly).  Ascend's air control is more forgiving than T1's which required energy to change direction.  Deployables are considerably simpler in Ascend compared to previous Tribes games.  I know in T2 you could change the barrel of turrets and such; none of which is present in Ascend.    Everything was streamlined to appeal to a bigger audience."

Ascend's air control is not that great, and chasing was literally impossible until the perk rage was introduced, combined with lightweight.  Chasing is still pretty impossible on some routes/cappers.  In comp we banned most deployables because they were op in a 7v7 atmosphere."

T1 is mechanically more difficult to master and offers greater freedom of movement and control, and as a result it has a longer steeper learning curve."
Tribes,3aod6k,prettzl,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:34:54 2015 UTC,"T:A is still very difficult to master and compete against the top players.  CS:GO is probably one of the easiest games to pickup and play, and yet at the competitive level it is still really fucking hard, and not considered a kiddie game.  Something that is easy mechanically does not make it easy at a competitive level.  I think that would be my point in this argument.  Just cuz T1 is a hard game to learn how to ski and jet around does not make it a harder game at the top levels of competition.  The only reason T1 is even hard to learn skiing is because it was a glitch; because it was ""poorly developed and refined"".  You were meant to run around and jet around, skiing was never intended.  In T:A, skiing was intended so they could streamline it and make it feel more natural/easy."
Tribes,3aod6k,perroTW,2,Wed Jun 24 22:58:20 2015 UTC,"TA is not hard to ""master"".  I know multiple people who started playing TA without having played other tribes games who were competent enough to PUG in a few weeks.  I have seen people run rock bounce routes that were met with praise on this site who haven't even figured out how to turn off large weapons and hints.  It just isn't that hard to get good at because so much of the game is simplified compared to past games.  Hard compared to yet another FPS where you hold a direction and point and click? sure.  Hard compared to any other tribes game or really any game with complex movement? no."
Tribes,3aod6k,mukhtar123456789,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:47:15 2015 UTC,"I think you are wrong.  It took me quite a while, maybe months, to learn to ski and jet around decently.  It took me more months to learn to duel well. I have put thousands of hours in the game and am still learning the intricacies of all the positions.  It took me at least a month to learn all the routes on the three more popular maps and how to run them well.  And this is only after having invested a so much time in competitive.  I still cannot cap on the other half of the maps.  I still cannot snipe at a competitive level either.  I really think you have not played much competitive T:A to argue how easy it is at the top level, and how much time investment is required to compete at those levels.  Ya, a guy who never turned off the big weapon models can run a rock bounce route if that is all he does for a couple hundred hours.  But, he probably watched a video and practiced it over and over before he got it.  And he probably was not a complete noob who just installed like you think.  There are many competent pubby cappers who have thousands of hrs who have big weapon models on.  Like I have been saying T1 might have an even harder learning curve than T:A but it doesn't equate to being a harder game at the high levels of competition.  Because, everyone at that level has already mastered the mechanics and are fighting others who have also mastered the mechanics."

What tribes game did he play before ascend is what I want to know. If you were never good at any of the previous games and want to talk about  the differences of each game, you're talking out of your ass and your opinion deserves no respect.  T:A has smoother skiing, no fog, flag indicators, smooth terrain,  etc etc. I'm not calling it an easy game compared to other fps games. But to t1 and t2, it's much easier to pickup and become good at. Hirez wanted an easier game, it makes sense in the business world."

Tribes,3aod6k,emjay101,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:03:44 2015 UTC,pardon hit me up i can give you lessons in both games
Tribes,3aod6k,D4M45T3R,3,Thu Jun 25 04:17:46 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.... all Tribes games have had a high skill ceiling, being a pro at T:A was probably not much different to being a pro at T1 or T2... but getting to be a useful and somewhat competitive player was a lot easier in T:A than in T1 or T2... but then of course in those games you could always go for a role like Gen D or Turret Monkey which still required skill / planning / tactics, but didn't have the same skill ceiling as an LD or a HO.  Skiing and aerial movement in T:A is quite noobified... it took considerable time just to learn to time your jump jet in T1 to get decent height to reach floating bases/platforms. And the ultra forgiving T:A lets you dead stop on demand if you overshoot a target while skiing... if you're going ultra fast in T1 / T2 and miss your target you're out of the action for a good while until you can find a way to slow down and turn around. No little gimmicky impulse boost either. Disc jumps were a lot more boost inducing in the older games, but a big health hit & no health regen is the cost.   T:A isn't the worst iteration of the major releases - T:V was. T:V actually had a lot of potential but was released too early with too few decent maps. By the time they had released some good map packs everyone had left to go back to T1 / T2.   T:A is probably the most 'newbie' friendly of all the games though... although T:V did have a whole single player campaign which was decent & could get people into the game more than T1 / T2 / T:A did with their simple tutorials."
Tribes,3aod6k,burningheavy,2,Mon Jun 22 12:19:01 2015 UTC,"it was a lot easier to be a high level player in t:a than in t2, that much i can say with absolute certainty. however, you are right, the skill ceiling was still high in a relative sense to other games (or at least the skill curve is a lot DIFFERENT to other fps games). that and the lack of support is what caused the playerbase to diminish so rapidly."
Tribes,3aod6k,TribalWanker,4,Wed Jun 24 13:46:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know so much about ""kiddie"" as ""Neutered"" . Also, for all intents and purposes T:A is fundamentally about as much a real ""tribes"" game as legions is, which is to say, not much at all."

However, it makes landing projectile shots harder having more volatile air movement and inheritance plus the map boundaries reduce the fast capping routes."

Tribes,3aod6k,imfukinking,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:13:19 2015 UTC,"O please I barely have ever bashed on T1.  I'm sure the game is fine.

But to say T1 is harder and therefore better than T:A, and  T:A is a kiddie game irks me.  Not that you said this, but someone from that community.  And, the T1 community has so much pride in their old game, constantly shitting on T:A; it is kinda annoying.  Ya, T:A had a lot of failures, but it is still pretty good, and very difficult at the top level, I think you would agree. But, don't get the wrong impression of me I wouldn't say a game is bad if I have never played a decent amount of it."

My understanding is that many of the woes behind Hirez's mismanagement lie with the company's owner, who decided that Tribes was bad for business, and another Dota clone was good, thus pulling all the resources from this game."

The other team was stacked with Dare capping, me (I actually played a decent game), Stork and Thumper on defense. If they didn't have an afk at the start of the match or w/e they might have won because we got 3 quick caps and then the rest of the 20 minute game it was 1-1.

It's a shitshow, albeit a fun shitshow. Everyone realizes it's a shitshow. 5v5 LT and any teamsize under 10 base are far more complicated in T1 and T2C. Lots of routes are performed and the complexity isn't soley getting the flag off the stand (though there is more to that than meets the eye with smart routing), it's more about flag play, communication (especially in T1 where there are no flag iffs), and tons of micro-decisions that add up. The complexity is more in it's mechanics in T1 LT, and strategy in T1 base and T2C (more so in T2C imo).  I'll give some insight into 7v7 T2C where you basically have everything there is in T:A in terms of content, but much more powerful secondary objectives (the generator is crucial because you spawn naked, you can destroy inventory stations and tons more), more intricate and difficult mechanics with the skiing and physics, more versatile but varied positions (no dedicated snipers, they all have chainguns and discs too), more important and interesting deployables you have to allocate your time to set and keep up like sensors, and top this all off with a larger variety of maps (actual good ones too!) with profoundly different strategies."

Hopefully someone else will come along to more clearly articulate why, but since it's seriously that wrong, I'm not sure anyone will. There are just so many things intrinsically wrong with T:A , and very little about it's meta game was ever complex. Not to mention 7 v 7 was usually an after thought in most tribes games competitive scenes, and having 14 players to command on larger maps with more options and less restrictions. Do the math.  imo, the most complex thing about tribes ascend meta was managing to organize 7 players who got along, well enough to actually practice. Many things about T:A were stale in comparison, flag play, stand offs, chasing, duels, the list goes on and on."

Tribes,3aa8eh,pard0n99,0,Tue Jun 23 19:57:24 2015 UTC,"You make it look like a worse tribes ascend, I dont get why people play that over T:A.  I mean we could ban snipers, make it 10v10 or w/e and its basically the same game with better graphics."
Tribes,3aa8eh,StorkSooFly,3,Fri Jun 19 17:54:29 2015 UTC,"Judging by your comment,  I'd say the 99 in your name stands for your year of birth. Which makes T1 older than you. No, they are not basically the same game. One is garbo and one is the reason some hack company tried to make a game similar to it."
Tribes,3aa8eh,duhlitz,-4,Fri Jun 19 18:04:41 2015 UTC,"As usual, replies with no explanation. Did everyone just skip English class in high school where you write your thesis and then explain why your thesis is correct.  No, they are not the same game and this is why T1 is so much different from T:A...  And I'm 29 btw, if you are actually interested, my first video games were text based with no graphics and then the Atari..."
Tribes,3aa8eh,pard0n99,5,Sat Jun 20 00:45:46 2015 UTC,"it's true, you can get a similar experience if you take out the turrets/classes/call-ins/nades/etc and stripped TA to just pathfinder only. you would also need to find a way to strip TA of its ""energy pack"" and rely on less energy, because that's whats going on in the video. We are playing tribes ""naked"".  why would we not play T:A in similar fashion? because the maps are shit, the physics are shit, and the overall experience would be even more dumbed down than naked T1. It's much easier to gain speed in T1 which is part physics and part map design - they are perfectly matched. T:A without energy packs would be a sludge fest compaired to T1. T1's vertical jets are more powerful than T:A and you have a lot more air control at higher speeds + it's still possible to gain decent speed in T1 without the e-pack.  You also need to realize you are watching the best killer in all of tribes atm and he's playing in a scenario when killing becomes even easier due to slower speeds. If you watched this same game from a capper's perspective, you would probably see the huge difference between T:A and T1.  If you havn't played T1 extensively, you won't fully understand why the games are different. You probably still wouldn't prefer it to T:A because it is difficult to switch over from a game that took away the skill in skiing to a game with rough edges that you need to hit just right in order to maintain good speeds."
Tribes,3aa8eh,StorkSooFly,-2,Sat Jun 20 02:15:03 2015 UTC,"I think we are both in the same boat.  I never got good at T1 and I don't think you played much of T:A.  When I played T1 like 9 years ago I remember how impossibly difficult it was for me to learn to ski and fly as well as everyone else.  But after playing so much T:A I think I could do a better job today.  As I recall that was the game where skiing was a glitch and I was raping my space bar.  However, since you have not played much T:A you would know that maintaining good speeds in T:A is also very difficult, and you still have to hit hills precisely to avoid craters/maintain speed.  If you ever capped at a competitive level in T:A you will find this out.  In T:A you can achieve very fast speeds quickly if you use rage/lightweight perks with thrust pack; very equivalent to what is seen in the video.  This would also make life regen take forever because that is the side effect of using lightweight.  Which I believe is similar to what T1 had, no energy regen and health packs or something.  So, coincidentally I believe you could achieve a very similar experience as seen in the video.  You could even enable freedom physics to give yourself even more air maneuverability.  In fact, all this has been done in T:A so I still don't know why T1 players are so steadfastly against the game other than irrational prejudice.  All these points are moot though considering both games are dead so I guess my only point is that the games are or can be more similar than T1 players would have people believe.  Obviously, there are many differences, but more similarities that T1 players like to talk about."
Tribes,3aa8eh,pard0n99,3,Sat Jun 20 06:42:53 2015 UTC,"So a guy who couldn't handle T1 is going to tell a 17 year vet how T1 and T:A are similar. Did you play T2 or was that too hard for you as well? I played T:A. Day 1 private beta I was there. It's very likely I could join a T:A pug with you and out preform you. Maintaining speed in ascend is not hard. And with all of the bullshit needed to make ascend play like 10v10 naked dx, you're basically comparing LT to naked. I'm saying take away about 20% of your energy and then play T:A 10v10 dx. If you want to add perks and what not, then compare it to T1 LT. Which is a different animal than playing naked.  The irrational prejudice in our conversation comes from your side. You have no clue what you are talking about."
Tribes,3aa8eh,StorkSooFly,2,Sat Jun 20 13:14:39 2015 UTC,"So a guy who couldn't handle T1 is going to tell a 17 year vet how T1 and T:A are similar.   This is literally, verbatim, the text book definition of the Dunning-Kruger Effect.    occurs where people fail to adequately assess their level of competence — or specifically, their incompetence — at a task and thus consider themselves much more competent than everyone else. This lack of awareness is attributed to their lower level of competence robbing them of the ability to critically analyse their performance, leading to a significant overestimate of themselves.   It's ok dude, I loved T:A too, but it's just so inferior as a tribes game."

Judging by this video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UfP9WaxYi0 you wouldn't know how to kill anything and would probably try to llama grab the flag all game.  The skiing in Tribes Ascend honestly looks more difficult than this."
Tribes,3aa8eh,duhlitz,3,Mon Jun 22 03:04:20 2015 UTC,"That's not a demo of me. That's dare capping. Remember, T1 was too difficult for you. Rtcll is widely considered the best chaser T:A ever had. Rtcll comes from T1. I'm stork, considered to be the nastiest stand d in the whole goddamn series. You don't know me because you play the kiddie version."
Tribes,3aa8eh,yeum,-1,Mon Jun 22 03:23:12 2015 UTC,"Rtcll best chaser in T:A, he could be the best, but I don't think he was ever considered the best chaser, he mostly sniped and played Offense.  I wouldn't say his background in T1 is the sole reason he was good in T:A.  Rtcll is just a skillful dude who tries real fucking hard, he's gonna be good at most games he plays.  T1 wasn't really too difficult for me, I was a noob, put like 15 hrs in maybe, it was fun, OK game, but nothing I was going to try really hard in and go pro or anything. The game was already dated when I played it 9 yrs ago in college.  I really only played cuz my roommate wanted to play, and it was free.  Nothing is really too hard for me if I decide to to try hard at it.  But I found no reason to give T1 my time, we played more Day of Defeat classic.  I don't think Tribes:Ascend is the kiddie version.  I think it is pretty hard with a high skill ceiling.  You should ask someone who has played a lot of all three like Swordfish or Rtcll himself."

Tribes,3a7cyy,Dodgesabre,4,Thu Jun 18 12:40:55 2015 UTC,"First off, thank you for doing all of this, you iz amazing.     Now on to the underserved requests. You may have covered this before, but would it be possible at some point to package all of what you have done, With MagicChain (the 1 without broken 0ping stuff) that also prevents some of the glytches/hacks/exploits you can as a sort of CommunityUpdate. So basically for people to get your awesome goodies, they also have to sacrifice the aforementioned exploits. Like would it be possible to prevent toggleboxing/flash.ini/etc using your Inject, or is that not possible anyways?"
Tribes,3a7cyy,Theheartattack,2,Thu Jun 18 00:30:42 2015 UTC,"Maybe.  Alot of the issues with magic chain I see is the strength of the colt itself. I believe we agreed on fixing the speeds so it matches a user at 30 ping rather than the 16 ping fire rate that v3/v4 has and have it toggle-able in the ini. We really don't wish to break public games in any form(unfortunately, there are a bunch of injects that already do this).  An anticheat is kinda what I was aiming for, although I wont have any time to work on the project for the next month but toggleboxing/flash I was considering patching out in particular yes. Not 100% on breaking other injects, we haven't discussed it. The last time people tried an anticheat here it went sour as well which is something to consider.  I also proposed that we create a set of modified weapon/physics values for people to use in custom servers, where we hard code what serverID(some we own in each region) the properties are applied on and reset once you disconnect from the server. This is of course not a promise that we will implement it but it was an idea none the less and if there are any security bugs it can be a huge issue. Even if we implement it we probably wont release it until we test it extremely thoroughly."
Tribes,3a7cyy,Pumpelchce,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:36:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the problem with the previous attempt at anticheat is it was intended to be forced, and couldnt necessarily be easily verified, and offered no benefit. Ive always though if a worthwhile packaged tool were made, but its ""downside"" was it prevented the hacks, people may use it anyways even if it prevents their prev preffered injects. Its not forced at that point, so there is nothing to cry about.     Either way, It is awesome that you guys are doing this."

When I have Mumble running while starting it the document view can't display any contents. I have to open Mumble after Visual Studio. Maybe there similiar issues with other programs."

Tribes,3a1z59,Lowerend,5,Tue Jun 16 16:45:34 2015 UTC,"Well. Enemy high level player might have some usefull perks like survival perk which heals you on ammo pick-ups, they might have plasma guns, gladiators, passive class armor stats increased.   You know, a standart tech with ""auto"" and only 1 turret at base level for a new player is nothing, but when you go and attack enemy base which has techs with 2 turrets, thumper and other usefull weapons (even if they suck), that's already not balanced. Not even talking about them having more base health with armor upgrades than usual class with no upgrades :(  That's a pretty dumb example but I hope you understand what I mean. Despite that, some ""perks and upgrades"" **matter ."

Tribes,3a1z59,DarcseeD,9,Tue Jun 16 17:50:30 2015 UTC,"I agree that people who go to low rank servers to ""own newbs"" are dickheads. They can't deal with other players being better than them, so instead of improving their skills, they go and abuse people who are new to the game.  But I see from your posts here that you're attributing a lot of the advantages higher rank players have to the fact that they have more weapons/perks unlocked. I know it might seem like gear matters a lot, but in reality player skill plays a much larger role than whatever perks and gear they have unlocked.  First of all, perks are very cheap and only a couple of them have a significant effect on how well you can do (Quick Draw being the most important, unless you're a capper).  As for other gear, sure, some items can give you an edge, but if you give a bad player all the gear available in the game, they'll still get dominated by a good player who has default loadouts. Besides, if you focus on a few classes, instead of trying to fully upgrade them all at the same time, it's rather cheap as well.  The game has a steep learning curve (compared to popular FPS games), so once you get out of the kiddie pool (newbie servers) and start playing against experienced players, the game becomes much harder. But realize, the vast majority of players you run into in public servers aren't even that good at the game. If you put in enough practice and are at least somewhat decent at FPS games, you can easily become better than them."

Tribes,3a1z59,Mindflayr,7,Wed Jun 17 00:30:11 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, a player's focus on most of those things reduces as they become more experienced. Important activities are a) getting their flag, b) keeping yours, and c) activities that feed into a) and b)."

Tribes,3a1z59,Lowerend,6,Wed Jun 17 01:37:17 2015 UTC,"Well, in CTF kills really don't matter. The objective is to cap the enemy flag 5 times before they do the same to you.  Spending time upgrading base assets and focusing on the generator is a common mistake new players make. Sure, having turrets helps on defence, but the time you spend on making sure the gen stays up and the turrets are repaired is better spent doing more important things.  Let me put it this way, what does it matter if your turrets are up when a capper comes in at a decent speed and grabs the flag? The turrets won't be able to hit the capper and all the time you spent making sure the base assets are repaired will be meaningless.  So, if instead you'd have focused on defending the flag (spotting cappers, trying to stop the capper, helping kill enemy offence who are clearing your flag stand, killing enemy JUG's who are mortaring your stand from afar), you'd be far more likely to stop the enemy capper from getting out.  Furthermore, and perhaps more importantly, you'll actually improve at the game at a much faster rate compared to looking at the generator and holding down your mouse button. This in turn means that the more you play the more effective you'll become at doing things that actually help your team.  So yes, you are wrong, not about the people who come to newbie servers to be dicks, but about how the game is played. But luckily you have plenty of time to improve."

The Minute they made spawn in gear they made focus on the gens actually hurt your team because you have less bodies taking or guarding the flags, and that is how you win. In most pubs, the team with more focus on both gens loses to the team actually capping and retrieving flags."

Tribes,3a4bm9,Maatin,2,Wed Jun 17 13:49:38 2015 UTC,"the physics work by making you grip things when you ski, thats why you can ski uphill or on the jagged spiky terrain etc. letting go of ski will still make you slide down hill and not sudden stop. when you jet to go straight up in the air you should be jumping at the same time to start with and give urself momentum to get off the ground jumpjet isnt auto bound to right click like some of other other games unless you have a script so u have to press spacebar.  matin wasn't bad at base but he did come from a very active mod more similar to t:a than base so he wasn't that tuned in with the weird skiing but more like booster capping and moving all over the map with the touch of a button similar to your nitron grenades but much faster.  he pu'd with us a bunch of times though and eventually got really good in higher level pus with his gf laura   both real cool ppl to play with very nice d00ds   matin and rtcll both played t1 a lot for over a decade (lol losers)"

Tribes,39zj5u,scrambler_jumper,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:32:29 2015 UTC,"Latency was suprisingly good with the Darkstar engine. it handled even up to like 32v32 without causing extra Lag. People did suffer from ""Rubber Bullets"" from time to time, until Interpolate Settings were found and later edited to make the tracers more accurate to the actual bullets (sound familiar?) but with the bigger spread of the CG it was less noticable. TTK was way longer, in that even high level comp cappers sometimes took double Djs into grabs , and grabbed at 10-15% health and could make it home if they were fast enough. The Sniper rifle being a projectile combined with Fog of war meant high speed caps could escape before getting easily owned by highly accurate aim."

Tribes,39x1da,jesusboy76,11,Mon Jun 15 14:25:57 2015 UTC,"I was gonna make a post about this after work today but since you started, here goes:  Kata was the first map we played, and it was honestly fantastic. It was incredibly difficult to get the flag out but it wasn't a D-stack. There was a huge amount of vehicle play, and esports getting the flag out and throwing to poor PersuasionRaisin who kept getting melted. In the end, intense, 4-4 OT ending (the final 4-4 cap was with 8 seconds left) and I would absolutely love to do it again.  Next was Drydock. Another great game, a lot different for sniping and open stand, lots of slides and grav grabs. We were up by quite a bit but then Snooks went to spectator mode for 5 minutes to view a player he believed to be hacking/triple injecting (?) and we lost 3 caps. Still a great game, but lesson learned I'm a shit sniper on DD I should stick to crashing.     Re-picked teams, played Arx. Another great game but the ending was a little farther apart in score than we expected. Swordfish and Howsya shone through w/ a great double cap that ultimately led their team to victory. Final flag position was good for defending, not a D-stack at all on my team (not sure about the other team, I was on D the whole time).  Finished up second round of PUGs with Crossfire. My team dished right back to them what they gave us on Arx, our D was a lot more coordinated and efficient on this map. Sniper definitely showed his worth on both teams, lots of effective vehicle play here again.    Final round of games was started with Bella. Unfortunately Hi-Rez never created a No Sandstorm version of Bella for Blitz so that added a bit of a dynamic we weren't initially expecting to deal with (to add to that, none of the fucking map codes were correct either). Some great plays all around here though, again more vehicle play than usual, and there was a significant increase in Moth dying to Blastman melees. Very fun game.  Last map was CCR, which was a bit of a shitshow. Constant slides and crashes made for lots of flag movement and baller returns. In the end though the enemy team won with the constant llama thrusts and back hill slides. Rincewind, goddamn your midairs.    I want to thank everyone who participated, I had a great time and I know probably half of the people who played really enjoyed it. The rest either didn't notice a difference or fucking hated it. To the latter half, I thank you even more for indulging me. Regular PUGs may resume.  If anyone has anything to add, please feel free!"

Tribes,39rvjb,the5thpixel,16,Wed Jun 17 03:14:24 2015 UTC,"Real tribes is not dead it's just sitting around chilling while people complain or argue about the sequel iterations that failed.  Had the series been given the cs/steam engine treatment where they don't try to change all the gameplay every new release and stuck with the darkstar game engine instead of moving to torque then later unreal we'd still have a large and thriving game and community and probably one of the most popular ""esport"" type games around.   Here's some further specific reasons of how the franchise was mismanaged.    t2-released with heavy crashes, physics sucked, people didnt like the soupy mud coloring aesthetic and graphics that werent crisp and sharp, a lot of new gimmicks introduced like a homing rocket launcher that could have just been taken care of for people wanting the option of playing with them by modding, the lead dev dave g admits he was trying to reinvent the wheel in changing key components of gameplay from the original for career acclaim and ego stroking and that in the end it was a huge mistake to not simply make a t1 clone with better graphics, eventually modders made t2classic in an attempt to replicate t1 but by then a large portion of the population had quit or gone back to t1 and t2classic didn't turn out like t1 anyway. at this point the communal aspect of the series is completely fucked and only gets worse because the global tribes community has become severely divided and it still remained so. the divisions continue again and again in each new iteration splitting up the community to the point where there is no sense of history or heritage. people fall into their clique or micro community and stick to it with almost religious fanaticism as new games that are totally different or unmoddable come out the old communities with strong ties die off (see pretty much every large competitive mod community in tribes 1 this includes renegades which matin came from or arena which rtcll came from)  tv-released with heavy crashes, couldn't even use competition mode till heavy modding a year after release, also gets the gimmick treatment when the grappler is introduced which again fundamentally changes what many people enjoyed about tribes, physics also sucked, was a single player story focused production game more than multiplayer which is lol for a tribes game t:a-quick cash grab by hirez, physics bad, generally boring dumbed down slow game, gimmick weapons for points earned, marketing team vampires, and kids with no sense of community/heritage of the game series emulating memes they never were around to see develop such as tribes talk or i am king all while being afraid of posting on the real community hub tribalwar   at this point it's very blatantly ignorant to not even try t1 for a week or so to at least experience the first game that started the whole series  and im not saying these sequel games weren't fun or loved by many people. im just answering the question posted about why we haven't had sustained longevity in the life and growth of the tribes series."

Tribes,39rvjb,qhp,5,Sun Jun 14 09:10:46 2015 UTC,"His points aren't even close to the reason why t:a wasn't more successful. It's just the typical hate for sequel games which can be observed any where. Quake world players hated q2, q2 players hated q3, q3 players hated q4. Tfc players hated tf2, broodwar people hated sc2, 1.6 players hated CSS etc.  While I don't really disagree with his points, the reason why the game failed is simply that it's a niche genre made by non-AAA studio.

Tribes,39rvjb,CallShenanigans,2,Sun Jun 14 04:20:06 2015 UTC,"I've posted on the topic before, but here's my two cents.  First, the death of the game is due to a lack of vision.  Hirez wanted to do it their way, and we wanted our input as well.  What resulted was a weird blend of half-baked community tools that did nothing but disservice everyone, pubbers and comp players alike.  I believe that we as a community could have stomached a gimmicky f2p p2w game or that the general public could have stomached a hardcore comp-oriented game.  However, neither path was taken, and the result was a disaster.  Hirez tried to double dip, and they didn't have the resources to.    The other downfall was our decision to move to NAtribes from TWL.  Nothing against Jim or the developers for trying; heck, I voted to do it as well.  However, I can admit my mistakes.  I don't want to go into the whole argument for this, unless you want to hear it, but rest assured that moving away from TWL was the single greatest mistake the community could have made.

No, what really ended tribes, was the following   Post Beta Content that broke the balance of the game.

Magic Chain not being implemented to fix the hit reg.   HiRez was just seemingly incompetent with this game.

Tribes,39m4g8,Mindflayr,9,Fri Jun 12 22:31:55 2015 UTC,Not to make this into a T1 vs t2classic debate but the freedom of movement in t1 is much different and more powerful than t2classic (which is why LT never took off in t2).  Really more people should try T1 LT for a while till they get moderately used to it because the control and speed you get is fundamentally different and better than any other tribes game which imo is something that should be celebrated and enjoyed by everyone.

Tribes,39m4g8,FishStix1,5,Sat Jun 13 12:56:49 2015 UTC,rejectile   please explain how t1 the game that zodd and z0dd stated they had the goal of trying to copy 100% while making t2classic mod was broken in the first place  t2classic was made to be as close an exact copy of t1 base as could be done in t2 (it didnt turn out that way but it tried and it did fix a lot of issues that t2 had on release which was positive). the creators of t2classic said this. the dev team of t2 said this. the tribes community at the time wanted it. so i'm not sure how this whole t1 base is broken thing ever came to be and tbh ur the only person that ive ever read saying this so id like an explanation.  also LT was tried in t2 no one played it and the ladder died very quickly because it played too soupy floaty and slow in t2 unlike in t1

Tribes,39m4g8,T1LuiGi,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:00:39 2015 UTC,"What constitutes a good Tribes CTF game is subjective, but I believe the Tribes Gala match demonstrates why Tribes 1 base is broken. The first 5 minutes are fine. You have flag movement, capping, and all of the other secondary objectives of a Tribes CTF game. But after that, it turns into a 10 minute stay-in-the-base standoff where nothing happens. It's no longer a CTF game, it's a game of breaking a turtle. No one wins this. It's boring to watch and play.  In T2C, base standoffs are still a bit of a problem, but they can broken easier than in T1. You have concussion grenades that knock the flag out off of people. You have better designed bases with multiple entrances to give offenses an easier time at getting inside. And you have shield pack heavies with high time-to-kills that can last longer inside an enemy base. This is one way that T2C is superior to T1 base.  In DX, SH, and HB games, they turn into a cluster match with no bases. It's basically a large LT match with less epacks.  The Jelly RD and SaiYeN SB demos are pretty hilarious to watch, but they must have been a nightmare to play against. They show some big problems with the sniper rifle in T1 (unlimited ammo, crazy damage bullshit) and lack of spawn protection (no chance to react)."

Tribes,39klvd,DarcseeD,2,Fri Jun 12 15:37:47 2015 UTC,Thats just such a huge load of bullshit
Tribes,39klvd,pard0n99,7,Fri Jun 12 18:51:23 2015 UTC,"Indeed it is. Here's another bullshit reason they gave for forcing everyone to play with low FoV:   The rationale here is that we want to avoid creating a situation of ""Haves and Have-Nots,"" where those who are aware of the slider are able to gain an advantage over those who aren't. Instead, we'd rather develop towards a unified FOV that feels good across the board.   So basically, no FOV slider, because they're afraid ultra casual players who never open the options menu won't use it and thus will be at a disadvantage.  That's just such an incomprehensibly stupid statement. They trust all players to be able to configure their mouse sensitivity, which is far more important to performing well in FPS games. They also allow players to fiddle with a multitude of graphics settings, which I would imagine are far more confusing for casual players and also give more advantages than an FoV slider. Yet somehow a simple slider, which adjusts your FoV, is too complicated for people to figure out?  I would argue that the people who are too clueless to know how to adjust their FoV aren't going to be playing the game at a level where it really makes a difference for them.  Furthermore, having a good mouse/pad, a high Hz monitor, the hardware capable of running the game at higher FPS values and a low ping all give much larger advantages to players than a slight FoV increase. Are they doing to lock the game at 30 FPS so that those who don't have the hardware to run it at 60 won't be at a disadvantage? Are they going to not allow people with 15 ping to play with people who have 60 ping? Of course not! But gotta force everyone to 80 FoV, because that's going to level the playing field, right?"
Tribes,39klvd,scrambler_jumper,2,Fri Jun 12 19:08:55 2015 UTC,"You do realize that whoever said that is probably lying right.  Its like the guy who said the human eye can't see past 60 fps to sell 60 hz monitors or games that are capped at 30 fps for cinematic feeling.  They are all straight up lying, there is prob technical issues with having an adjustable fov and still get a good  frame rate in a game you don't plan to optimize.  Also counterstrike doesnot have an adjustable fov weirdly enough but if you change your resolution or  ""view model"" its the same as changing your fov.  There are also in game fov command that most of the plebs don't know about.  So CS:GO almost took the opposite route lol, lets include an FOV slider that most people wont know exists.  But CS:GO optimized there game so everyone gets 100 plus fps at whatever fov you want, what a novel idea in a competitive E-Sport fps."
Tribes,39klvd,DarcseeD,3,Fri Jun 12 20:35:06 2015 UTC,"So...what's your point? Obviously it's a lie to cover inadequacy or laziness, probably the latter. No fov slider is excused because of technical complications? As a web developer I know I wouldn't have a job if I told clients we couldn't include features because of 'technical complications'. No, that's what you get paid for."
Tribes,39klvd,pard0n99,2,Fri Jun 12 21:04:21 2015 UTC,"You do realize that whoever said that is probably lying right.   Yes? I would assume that was clear, since I started my post by saying it's a bullshit reason."

This is it. Politically incorrect but 100% true. And that's aside from the fact that their own reasoning is undermined by your other points; no fps or refresh lock, ping differences, etc. It's all relative."

Tribes,39ldt0,Symtex123,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:31:47 2015 UTC,Don't have to play a pug to know that trying out a new game mode might attract a different crowd. Also for newer players they might feel the playing ground is a little more inviting since even current pug players dont have hundreds of hours of experience in blitz specifically. And there were a few people who tried pugs for the first time with this blitz thing so that pretty much nulls your argument.

Tribes,39gxil,nordsmark,3,Thu Jun 11 21:19:52 2015 UTC,"Well I suppose its difficult for captain 1 to properly pick player roles without knowing which captain will be on each team, for example if one captain is a scope and the other is a capper, those are niche roles which you build the team around. Might not be a big deal in practice, just occurred to me. Other than that it seems pretty good."

Tribes,39gsue,Mindflayr,2,Thu Jun 11 19:24:56 2015 UTC,"Rock bouncing seems to be a little more forgiving with safe fall, could just be placebo though. With or without reach flags go right through me so idk"
Tribes,39gsue,scrambler_jumper,2,Thu Jun 11 17:01:32 2015 UTC,You got it just right there: if you're taking damage while landing you're either doing it poorly or using the wrong hill. You may want sf for rock bouncing but when it comes to getting ahold of a well defended flag reach is a must.
Tribes,39gsue,Achus619,2,Thu Jun 11 18:14:03 2015 UTC,"If you're having a bit of a tough time learning routes, it's fine to run safe fall. Just by merit of 'completing' the route you get experience so when you do take the training wheels off, you can perform it well.   If you ever want to run a new route though, Safe Fall is good to use. You'll begin to recognize when you hit something wrong based on your speed but at least you can keep going.   There are definitely some (Hootybird) routes that safe fall is required for. It's not a strictly useless perk for capping."
Tribes,39gsue,persuasionlaser,2,Thu Jun 11 20:09:37 2015 UTC,"Anytime you crater, whether you have Safefall or not, you lose speed. Not having Safefall teachs you to not crater, and your speed becomes more consistent."
Tribes,39gsue,Martywah,2,Fri Jun 12 03:07:35 2015 UTC,"NA - Reach, EU - Safe fall. (pugs ofc) After a certain level the only reason you use reach is to avoid being taken out by a shrike post grab. If you're just playing pubs then reach is incredibly powerful."
Tribes,39gsue,PowerTattie,4,Fri Jun 12 15:26:16 2015 UTC,"I used Reach in the beginning but as I got better clearing the stand, learning faster, sneakier routes (especially with rock bounces) I pretty much run SF all the time unless the defense has a killer hof. I'll switch it up if that's the case but if I'm getting out without consistent difficulty I stick with SF.   Personally I find that SF opens up more options to be creative with routes/returns. Particularly if you need to switch things up on the fly for any given reason. I like the flexibility and security.   Another thing for me not using Reach is that it really helped improve my flag grabbing/catching. May sound backwards but I focus a lot more without Reach and am way more precise when I go for the flag. It helps that you don't have to worry about your landing either when passing or field grabbing ;)   It's worth mentioning ping I think. Ever since NAW died and only central and NAE servers are active, I find SF helpful in that it can save you from clipping terrain due to lag you may encounter that will unexpectedly cause damage. So depending on your ping that may change what you decide to use. It's helpful for me especially when I play on NAE servers where my ping is 70. When you're going 300+ with that ping and you surprisingly die from clipping terrain it can get frustrating.    With all that said, to be a great capper with regards to this topic IMO you need to know routes where you can bring the bacon home without using SF. Always good to have a couple non-SF routes for each side of each map.   It's interesting to see the feedback here, I guess it's personal preference based on how you cap. I find SF helpful much more often then Reach but will switch it up if the situation calls for it. I think you'll have to feel it out as you get better at capping in general. Keep trying them both as you get better and see which one fits you best, that you're most successful with. Hope that helps! :)"
Tribes,39gsue,Gurhm,2,Fri Jun 12 01:46:43 2015 UTC,both reach and safefall are a crutch in a way but in my humble opinion reach is the greater crutch of the two and plus I actually feel bad for some hof thrusting past with reach is way too easy so I normally use safefall
Tribes,39gsue,Snowierfudge,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:13:04 2015 UTC,"If you run routes perfectly, you can use Reach. But i personnaly play with Safe fall rather than Reach cause it allows you to be more flexible when you cap. And it will probably learn you to self clear better :)"
Tribes,39gsue,Loxiasus,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:57:42 2015 UTC,Reach. Always. Unless there is a shrike or you are running a derp route on kata or something way too visible for fun.

Tribes,39gsue,Bloodwah,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:02:50 2015 UTC,"Reach IMO is wayyy better due to the power you get vs a hof. That and if you need to stop at their stand to return your flag after an e grab, its that much easier to get the flag back. Safe fall is 100% crater proof though so in case hirez does it's thing with the glitchy terrain you don't get punished too badly for trying to ski where you want"

Tribes,39a7e6,bagofwiggins,2,Wed Jun 10 16:21:06 2015 UTC,"Yes this would not be hard to do, but... Maybe the best option would be to give players full control over damage numbers, via a lua function. You would basically have as input the initial coordinates, number to display, and you output the text, color, position, scale you want. So you could do anything you want, but it would involve a bit of programming. Interested ? (or just grab someone who knows how to code in lua and beg him to do it for you). With that you could scale down numbers as they go away, scale numbers depending on their damage, etc..."
Tribes,39a7e6,indiceiris,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:50:04 2015 UTC,yeah that'd be great. rainmeter uses lua right?
Tribes,39a7e6,wordthompsonian,3,Wed Jun 10 22:26:18 2015 UTC,"Apparently. Lua is used in a lot of software, particularly video games, as scripting tool or configuration language. I hope people will try to do interesting things with this project !"

Tribes,39a7e6,AvianIsTheTerm,4,Wed Jun 10 18:26:23 2015 UTC,"I tested it briefly. One problem with the flag icon: If you disable it, it will be shown when somebody grabs the flag, so that works as intended. The problem is, if the flag is loose somewhere off stand, it has no icon as well. Dunno if you guys can do anything about that but it would be best to always show it when it's not on stand.  Crosshairs work flawlessly now and damage number scaling and positioning is a godsend. Good job you guys!"

Tribes,39a7e6,420BROSCOPE,2,Fri Jun 12 11:43:29 2015 UTC,this is amazing...thx for all the work put into this. for a future patch is it possible to add the ability to change chain bullet colors for easier visibility?
Tribes,39a7e6,Kirotera12,2,Fri Jun 12 16:37:17 2015 UTC,"easier visibility   Yeah sure... You obviously just want rainbow bullets to match the damage numbers :)  Joke aside, idea noted !"
Tribes,39a7e6,Kirotera12,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:01:56 2015 UTC,"let me first say, as someone who plays on a toaster with resolution set very low, the disable player icon thing benefits me hugely because normally player names and health bars are distractingly large. I tested it out, very cool! Unfortunately I cannot tell friend from foe without first spotting them, based on my 10 minute test drive i just did. Do you think there is a possibility breaking down the player icons, into what specifically the user wants to remove? Really the only thing that bugs me is the gigantic names hovering over players heads. The damage numbers changes are awesome, I'm going to have fun tinkering with this in the next couple of days, keep doing awesome things, and thank you."
Tribes,39a7e6,angrypolak1,3,Wed Jun 10 12:19:36 2015 UTC,"This is the same problem as scaling icons basically.

And there's a bug in the tool with decimal values, so you'll have to put them manually in custom.lua if you want scaled damage numbers/crosshair for now  EDIT: Ok I see where the problem is, it's still because it doesn't like decimal numbers.

It's especially strange coming from a company like Hi-Rez, which was largely financed by the CEO spending tens of millions of his own money to get things started. Sadly not every game developer is a multi-millionaire and crowd funding is one way for them to put bread on the table while working on their games.

That said, he relies completely on the high health pool of the DMB class. Always walks straight towards you while eating damage and hoping that his high health pool allows him to out DPS you.

Tribes,394hi8,DusttoAshes,3,Tue Jun 9 05:29:47 2015 UTC,a .ini command that allows you to see player hitboxes from across the map/through fog (including invisible people).
Tribes,394hi8,yeum,2,Tue Jun 9 05:34:31 2015 UTC,"Ah I see, that might be the case though he rarely missed a bullet and rarely hit an explosive unless you touched the ground, he basically spammed gast's rifle 24/7."

Tribes,394hi8,AvianIsTheTerm,0,Tue Jun 9 20:45:44 2015 UTC,"Were it not for the fact that it makes spotting trivial I'd be fine with it being used.

Box.ini is a cheat though when it comes to organised play, because it can be used to get unfair spots."

Tribes,394hi8,Lazzirus,-1,Tue Jun 9 21:58:47 2015 UTC,Or they're just better than I am at honor play. Most of us know how to spot botters by now. Accusing an honor fusor of using some magical fusor aimbot isn't really my style.  Now the kids using triggerbots with hitscan weapons...lol
Tribes,394hi8,vermice1li,2,Tue Jun 9 22:41:02 2015 UTC,You should spec him. He toggles. It's obvious when he chains or uses hitscan and still pretty obvious when he uses fusors.

Make sure your PC has packet priority and nothing is stealing your priority or bandwidth.   Use a wired connection, no wi-fi Turn all your graphics down to as low as possible, despite whether or not your PC is capable of handling high graphics Tweak your .ini file Use Windows 1:1 mouse to cursor ratio fix (link at the bottom of post) Find the best OS DPI & sensitivity, mouse DPI & sensitivity, and in-game sensitivity that best suits you.  Some like to switch it, on the fly, depending on the weapon.  I personally prefered high mouse DPI and low mouse sensitivity and in-game sensitivity. Get a good mouse with a perfect sensor.  Make sure you get a good mouse pad that operates best with your particular mouse, and there's no skipping and whatnot, and that the slide/grip suits you. Make any adjustment that benefits your the physical movement of your arm, wrist, hand, etc.  Proper chair, desk, and heights of those are important to me, as is the placement of your mouse and keyboard. Make sure to make T:A and all it's services an exception to any type of real time protection or scanning from programs on your PC Never ever use V-sync.  Make sure it's disabled in the game and on your card. Learn how to properly use third person Realize this game has a much higher skill ceiling and learning curve than most FPS's, and a lotl the weapons have different timing, that are also effected by your players speed and direction of his current movement when you shoot.  Raider tip - it's all 'bout learning how to properly manage your energy with the shield Get on VoIP with someone good, duel them, and ask them for tips while you're dueling and ask them to specifically tell you what you're doing badly or wrong. Don't give up.  Once you get the hang of it, nothing else will compare.     After trying everything else to no avail, I saw a player, cough /u/Soninova cough, go from horrible to incredible just by finally turning off v-sync, no joke.  The little things matter and add up.   Have fun!     Edit:  Here's the mouse fix link = http://donewmouseaccel.blogspot.com/2010/03/markc-windows-7-mouse-acceleration-fix.html Edit #2:  Forgot to mention, make sure to disable acceleration, prediction, angle-snapping, and enhance pointer precision in your mouse, OS, and game options, if available.   Edit # 3:  This seems to be a pretty good list of mice considered to have ""flawless"" sensors, as in no acceleration, angel-snapping, tracking, skipping, or speed issues  =   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZzbKDmFOqsP_ut2RdctD01OEbZzbXol6HLwqVkSmZcg/edit#gid=0"
Tribes,390bn7,Meremothy,2,Mon Jun 8 09:58:31 2015 UTC,"What does v-sync do that creates the need to disable it? Also, is it only in this game or most FPS games where v-sync should be off?"
Tribes,390bn7,kabosh7117,2,Mon Jun 8 12:17:36 2015 UTC,"V-sync introduces input lag by forcing your game's frames to match your monitor's refresh rate, without deviation.  In any first person shooter it's crucial, in my humble opinion, to disable v-sync right off the bat.  I can handle a lil' bit of screen tearing in return for less input lag.      Edit: To be on the safe side, I would also disable it in your .ini file, in your video card's settings, as well as in-game."
Tribes,390bn7,Meremothy,2,Mon Jun 8 12:25:26 2015 UTC,Great info! Thanks for the quick reply. I always followed blindly and had my v-sync off but never actually took the time to ask the reason for it being off. I'll have to make sure my other shooters have it disabled as well!
Tribes,390bn7,kabosh7117,2,Mon Jun 8 12:55:17 2015 UTC,I'm surprised more people don't third person. If I'm not fighting and not about to disc jump I'm in third.

Tribes,390bn7,PowerTattie,4,Mon Jun 8 09:16:07 2015 UTC,"The strength of raider comes from survivability and avoiding damage. I used to sometimes join a dm and not fire a single bullet, but purely work on avoiding as much damage as possible. You'll find that over time you'll start to internalise timings of when to jet to avoid splash, and when to adad. Also, hills are OP... fighting up them vs a soldier as raider is a free kill for the most part.   Edit: Also try to get used to dodging splash damage without jetting.

Tribes,390bn7,scrambler_jumper,3,Mon Jun 8 18:17:24 2015 UTC,"Do you really think there's that much of a difference in fragging power/dueling strategy from pug to pub player? It's not like every pug player is an mstarr. Don't get me wrong, plenty of pub players are incompetent, but there's also a shitload of good duelers.     Aside from that you're often getting 3v1'd in a pub, if you can mitigate damage while being 3v1'd then I doubt you are forming bad habits."
Tribes,390bn7,PowerTattie,3,Tue Jun 9 15:44:08 2015 UTC,"exactly, this isn't a series of 1v1's. You're timing the reload of the guy behind you, while dodging the guy in front of you."

If he wants to, I guess. I agree that would be the best way to practice.   But I fail to see how practicing in any fashion would form 'bad habits' unless you were playing all level 1's or didn't have any common sense."
Tribes,390bn7,Gimmesoup,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:34:21 2015 UTC,"It's nice for picking up some basic hill hiding stuff, but you can get used to pubbers missing sometimes if you're not super careful about it.

Tribes,390bn7,Symtex123,2,Sat Jun 27 08:37:17 2015 UTC,"True, but you are not a good representative of the pub community at large. The vast majority of pubbies play sub optimally so you can be lazy in your own technique or may not be forced to discover new ways to play.

Tribes,390bn7,oceanembers,2,Sat Jun 27 18:26:39 2015 UTC,"What meremothy said. As for the rest, I'm no pro player, but I have had some fun playing around with raider so:  Jamming makes you invisible to turrets. Use this to stand as close to them as you want and spam them with your weapon of choice.  It's takes a small amount of practice, but it's totally possible to 'nade jump off the grenade launcher or the stickies, if you fire them on the ground ahead while skiing. Not entirely practical, but fun and occasionally useful if you're in the right time/place to go for a flag grab.  Dropping a cluster grenade right before you die will occasionally be immensely satisfying, as you watch your killer go for your ammo drop and get hammered by five or six explosions  Raiders are most useful in base offence. You'll get nothing but frustration trying to defend with a raider, unless you're in the gen room, spamming the entrance (which lbh isn't all that fun).  It should be noted though, that it's always good to switch it up a bit. Have fun with all the classes. I'm guilty of not playing enough sen or brute, myself."
Tribes,390bn7,DarcseeD,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:43:50 2015 UTC,"Jamming makes you invisible to turrets. Use this to stand as close to them as you want and spam them with your weapon of choice.   While this is of course true, I would pretty much always suggest using a Shield Pack instead. It's fairly easy to avoid turret fire and the advantages of the Shield Pack are just too good to give up.  Look at it this way, the Shield Pack is useful wherever you are on the map and for everything you could be doing (duelling, absorbing sniper damage, boosting yourself with explosives, etc). The Jammer Pack is only useful when you want to avoid turrets from targeting you and when trying to make yourself harder to spot. Since as a RDR your primary goal should be duelling enemy defenders and clearing the flag stand, survivability is far more important than concealment."
Tribes,390bn7,THEM0RNlNGW00D,2,Mon Jun 8 23:24:32 2015 UTC,"General Advice:   If you're in a low point or hit a plateau remember than nothing about progression is linear, keep pushing forward. Challenge your own decision making. Take the time to analyze the decisions of others. Be wary of entering decision loops which result in nothing. If you duel and lose, take the time during respawn to look back on what worked, what didn't, and what you can change right now to alter the outcome of the next attempt. The only thing better than practice is more practice. Make time to spectate others, if you see a good duelist feel free to follow them around a bit. Learn how they think, how they approach different situations, and figure out how you can apply this to yourself. Ask someone to duel you, doesn't hurt to ask and if there is time try to get some feedback. Don't forget the objective! Its easy to become self indulged, especially with Hi-Rez's accolade system feeding your ego, but if you're playing CTF play CTF.   Raider Advice:   Work on your ADAD, strafing, and positioning. Even if you start with a terrible opening you can recover so long as you position yourself close to cover or LOS blockers (such as juking on a mound or hill), strafing away from slower projectiles, and ADADing to minimize chain damage you can make the comeback. Don't forget to use your belt items! EMP/XLs may not hit as hard as APs or Frag XLs but without an energy pool many are victims to the great AOE of Raider primaries and mulched by NJs. Clusters are great at flushing people out of cover. Use the knock back momentum of explosive projectiles to regain your footing, Raiders have the advantage at a distance with either pack so if you need breathing space take it whenever it may come. Conserve your energy. Turn off packs when not necessary, try to ski more and jet only when necessary. Energy is movement, movement is survival. Use your primaries to zone your opponent, preventing them from getting into their ideal situations leaves them playing on the back foot. When you learn to land direct hits they double as zoning and premium damage. If your opponent is hyper aggressive EMP to nerf their movement, primary to zone them away from you, and chain them down as they charge like a mad bull/back off trying to regain momentum. Lead, don't be lead. Following is not a strong suit of any class."
Tribes,390bn7,socalpk,2,Mon Jun 8 15:53:33 2015 UTC,"if you're playing CTF play CTF   There are so many games out there to play DM. Where there is no other objective other than KD ratio or kill count. TA can be more than that, it is more than that for many and sadly it is only that for some. Enjoy Tribes for what it was meant to be (from it's inception), and get it's full potential, it is much more than just killing. TA makes it a bit harder to realize but Tribes has always been deeper than just that (killing). Even duels were supposed to be more eventful and rewarding and were until TA invented ADAD."
Tribes,390bn7,MadWlad,0,Mon Jun 8 19:43:01 2015 UTC,"ehm no.. autos where always a part of Tribes.. I heard so much MG-fire in S:T, I still can playback the spinning up and firering in my head (300 rounds with ammo pack non-stop?).. T2 even invented the ""Chainwhore"""
Tribes,390bn7,socalpk,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:41:36 2015 UTC,"Umm, yes. Didn't say the chaingun didn't exist, you know with spin up and spread and limited effectiveness with distance and most players on a 56k modem. lol. TA made the auto prolific and the most effective killing tool in Tribes for all classes and roles, never before had it been the primary weapon for the vast majority of players, fundamentally reducing the duel to an ADAD mess and leaving encounters more ho-hum than in any other Tribes....just hose and move on, nothing to see here. The problem with autos is they became a crutch in TA and as a result reduced the depth and thrill of the franchise overall, like bringing a gun to a knife fight...might be wise but hardly memorable."

Tribes,390bn7,SJ0,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:09:38 2015 UTC,"edit: I wrote 1 and 2 thinking you were a newbie. Instead of deleting them i will let them be there and and some other stuff at the end.  1) Soldier is the best class for a newbie. You can have chain weapon AND spinfusor at the same time while having solid health, mobility AND great grenades along with excellent utility pack.  2) I'm not sure if Raider is the most friendly class for a newbie. Arx buster is flat out not newbie friendly. Grenade launcher is best used while playing on offense however since it isn't exactly the most reliable weapon during duels you'll be required to chain. Your belt item aren't exactly 100-0 unless you can hit clusters but that won't happen if you're in open. While your packs (both shield and jammer) are great, I would assume it will hurt newer players more as they will run out of energy constantly.    Specific Raider Tips:  Primary  Arx Buster is love. So many times if I hit 2 shots, I get free air mail kill because the first exposition launches the enemy on air lol  Don't view Dust Devil as a downgrade. Start with Dust and then later move into Arx.  Grenade Lanucher is best used on offense to clear stand, spam enemy defense during flag holdouts, etc. Greth has done some GL videos where he stands far away and shoots at enemy stand. 90% of the time it isn't the most effective thing but it is fun nevertheless. https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=grenade+launcher+tribes+ascend  Secondary  I use Desert NJ4 SMG because I can miss 50 shots and not feel bad lol  Belt Item  cluster grenade if you're playing closed door. always use cluster grenade on crossfire.  while it may not be 100% accurate, I think people can still benefit from this wiki http://www.tribesascendwiki.com/Raider  P.S. play jug if chaining is hard and proceed to 1 shot people from 50 miles away."

I need to wait until I have enough XP to purchase all the Raider's weapons so I can mess around with them and find what works best for me, but I'll check out the Desert SMG and the Dust Devil.

Tribes,38wo2y,H3Cki,15,Sun Jun 7 13:46:42 2015 UTC,"It's sad, but in my opinion this montage is boring. You did good shots and a nice work putting it all together, no doubt. It just looks like many other montages out there on YouTube. I love comp or pug scenes, it's great if something works out as intended because of good teamwork. I also like consistent play. The midairs you did were very good, but most of them seemed too casual for me, too... random. I'm not telling you cannot midair consistently. You had some multi-midairs (multiple enemies in one short clip) in your montage which impressed me more than any ranged rabbit midair. There just should have been more of that kind, or (which of course is only my personal preference) a more enjoyable music and shots that fit right in. A good example for this in my opinion is Senexs montage 'Ludo', he did some great editing there. This comment will probably get a lot of downvotes which is fine by me. Just please don't think of it as a 'hate comment' of some kind, I watched the montage more than once to make sure I can write a good criticism."

Tribes,38wo2y,Dodgesabre,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:52:59 2015 UTC,Tbh I found this way more entertaining then comp montages. I'd rather see something that happens 1/100 then what looks to me like regular gameplay. There are negative aspects to both types of montages I guess and it's all subjective.
Tribes,38wo2y,DarcseeD,-3,Sun Jun 7 20:39:55 2015 UTC,"Tbh I found this way more entertaining then comp montages.   You can't be serious. You found this more entertaining than some of the best comp montages, like jpWAI's Outrun for example?   I'd rather see something that happens 1/100 then what looks to me like regular gameplay.   So you'd rather watch luck than skill? Because let's be frank, throwing hundreds of disks in Rabbit and getting a few midairs has more to do with luck, while making good plays in comp/pugs usually takes skill."
Tribes,38wo2y,Dodgesabre,9,Sun Jun 7 23:04:38 2015 UTC,"Oh get over yourself.  Not everything in ""comp"" is skill based and the only thing worth a damn is the stuff that happens out of the ordinary(which for most common ""comp"" folk, involves a lot of luck).  Sure you can show me how fkn keeno you are with hitting >60% chain on floaters or getting a tripple on people not even shooting at you that were a couple shots each or less, that isn't going to be entertaining to watch though.  Things that happen that are out of the ordinary, plays that actually matter and stuff where there is actual pressure is more entertaining. Getting out against a full stand, getting a decent shot under pressure(yods latest montage had quite a few of those for instance). That shit is entertaining.   When it comes to these pub montages, hitting a shot out of the ordinary is still special and since I don't do it on the regular this is entertaining to me. If someone made a montage of just hitting shrike or tank mid-airs I'd fine that entertaining.  Then there is the way people edit which could make the video entertaining and blah blah blah. Who the fuck cares what it is from.  Think of it like how YooNiZz hit that massive mid-air conk that was in his montage or got out by duking the hof. Way better then some new to pugs cunt gettin one clipped.  I didn't state I hated comp montages either, yoonizz's and jp's are probably my top 2."
Tribes,38wo2y,DarcseeD,2,Mon Jun 8 00:33:29 2015 UTC,"Oh get over yourself.   Not sure how this applies. I'm not a comp player nor have I ever made a Tribes montage. I simply don't think I'm good enough at the game to put out a montage.   Not everything in ""comp"" is skill based and the only thing worth a damn is the stuff that happens out of the ordinary(which for most common ""comp"" folk, involves a lot of luck).  Sure you can show me how fkn keeno you are with hitting >60% chain on floaters or getting a tripple on people not even shooting at you that were a couple shots each or less, that isn't going to be entertaining to watch though.   Where did I say any of that? Stop using straw-man arguments and putting words in my mouth. You are cherry picking the less impressive moments from the less impressive comp/pug montages and claiming as if I said those are the ones that should be looked up to, while completely avoiding the fact that I explicitly mentioned jp's Outrun, which you later yourself say is one of your top 2 favorite montages.   Things that happen that are out of the ordinary, plays that actually matter and stuff where there is actual pressure is more entertaining. Getting out against a full stand, getting a decent shot under pressure(yods latest montage had quite a few of those for instance). That shit is entertaining.   Exactly. Which is what most of the good comp/pug montages consist of. You said that you found this montage more entertaining than comp montages, but now you're disproving your own statement by pointing out exactly what makes comp montages more entertaining than watching random MA's in Rabbit.   When it comes to these pub montages, hitting a shot out of the ordinary is still special and since I don't do it on the regular this is entertaining to me. If someone made a montage of just hitting shrike or tank mid-airs I'd fine that entertaining.   That's great. But in your initial post you said that you found this specific montage ""way more entertaining than comp montages"" - a montage which consists largely of MA's made in Rabbit (not out of the ordinary, don't matter, no actual pressure - so lacking all the things you just mentioned you feel make montages entertaining).   Then there is the way people edit which could make the video entertaining and blah blah blah. Who the fuck cares what it is from.   Really? Who the fuck cares what the footage is, as long as the editing is good? What happened to all the things you mentioned that make montages entertaining to watch? So if you made a montage showing ""how fkn keeno you are with hitting >60% chain on floaters or getting a tripple on people not even shooting at you that were a couple shots each or less"" and used great editing, it would suddenly become an entertaining montage?   Think of it like how YooNiZz hit that massive mid-air conk that was in his montage or got out by duking the hof. Way better then some new to pugs cunt gettin one clipped.   But earlier you claimed that you found this montage ""way more entertaining than comp montages"". Yoonizz's and jp's montages fall under that category.   I didn't state I hated comp montages either, yoonizz's and jp's are probably my top 2.   I feel like I'm repeating myself, but this isn't what you said in your initial post. I'm arguing your original statement that this montage is ""way more entertaining than comp montages"". Sure, you didn't say you hated comp montages, but you said this montage was more entertaining. Don't you think that does discredit to the amount of practice and work comp players put into becoming good at this game, recording footage and making montages? They could have just hopped into Rabbit, gotten a few MA's, slapped some epic music behind it and would, in your eyes, have made ""way more entertaining montages""."

Tribes,38wo2y,SJ0,3,Mon Jun 8 01:22:09 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but much like /u/iOMelon, I'm going to have to be quite critical. This is partially due to me just being completely jaded when it comes to T:A montages. If it's not a PUG or comp montage with really good plays, I just don't find it impressive or engaging. The one exception being montages that go for comedic effect and showcase funny plays.  To start off on a small positive note, I think the music was really well synced. That said, I also feel the music was a bit too ""epic"" for the footage that was being shown. Powerful orchestral singing while showing midair shots in Rabbit just seems out of place.  This leads me to the next issue I had. I think Rabbit footage is just awful for montages. The whole point of that game mode is to fling disks ad nauseam at the target and hope to get a midair. It's not a special thing if you midair someone in Rabbit, it's not something unique, it's not montage worthy.  A montage consisting 80% of Rabbit MA's just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. The few clips that you had from regular gameplay were much better (like the long range concs for example). We've all seen plenty of midairs, what's more, we've seen them in competitive and pug environments, where they have much more value.  Again, sorry for the negativity. I'm sure there are people out there who enjoy MA montages like this, I'm just not one of them. I would suggest that if you make a montage if the future, try to mix in a bit more CTF footage. It's far more entertaining to see someone chase down a flag carrier and MA or conc them right before they cap, than it is to watch someone play Rabbit."

Tribes,38ud47,MadWlad,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:54:47 2015 UTC,"Hehe. Well the physics of it is kind of silly: You twist a magnet into a coil fast enough to generate a voltage differential (THROUGH THE ENDS OF THE COIL). LOTS of voltage, hence...the spring-loaded mechanism spinning the magnet so fast.  But this would normally just create a gap; electrons would flow one way, electron holes the other. One end of the wire would be packed full of negative charge, the other end would have lots of free spots for electrons, and would be positively charged.  The middle would be conductive wire wanting to equalize; you would then separate each end, and while filling the positive end with electrons supplied by..whatever, you would hold the supercharged capacitive plate out on a stick away from you.  Theoretically I guess you could design the gun shape so that the electrons wouldn't want to zoom around and just zap you, instead just...ionizing the air. There's a name for that phenomena but I can't remember.  tl;dr: Yes, and I already have been. :P"

So the disc could be some kind of spinning magnet ..I think small magnets should rotate on x or y axis, and a big ring o could rotate on z.  ..in theory you could end up with a donut-like spiral.. it also should have rotor shape inside to generate enough lift opposed to the gravity to keep it straight"

Tribes,38smi6,J4ckTh3Bl4ck,3,Sat Jun 6 13:58:29 2015 UTC,the creators don't want to release yet
Tribes,38smi6,AvianIsTheTerm,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:32:19 2015 UTC,"It will be released Soon(TM) - whenever Ensiss is happy with the featureset we've got. There have only really been a few things (including the dmg number stuff) added since the last public release, and there are several major things we've got in the works that will probably make it into the next release."
Tribes,38smi6,qhp,6,Sat Jun 6 22:41:40 2015 UTC,Wait a sec do those damage numbers add up your total damage done to a target on each hit? Something like a timer that resets after n ms without damage? The fuck am I looking at? I'd love to see something like that for shotguns (one damage number which is the sum of all damage done in one shot's pellets).
Tribes,38smi6,AvianIsTheTerm,4,Sat Jun 6 19:23:45 2015 UTC,"Hey, I implemented the 'chain damage streaming' / 'adding up' feature you can see in the video. It'll be available in the next release of the mod, but it effectively works as follows:  If the showDamageNumberStream config variable is true, then the mod keeps a track of the total damage given, and displays that rather than the individual bullet damage (note that this is purely based on the 'show damage number' event that's hooked into by the mod, so it doesn't distinguish between targets or anything).  There's also another config variable, damageNumberStreamTimeout (if you don't set this, it will default to 0.5 seconds), that sets how long it counts for. Basically, if you don't hit a bullet for longer than the damageNumberStreamTimeout, it will reset the counter to 0.  There's also an alternate version (using another config variable) that counts bullets rather than damage - so if you were chaining, you'd see the number of bullets you'd hit rather than the damage they'd done.  The rainbow bullets are /u/Dodgesabre's work, and they're beautiful :')    As to the shotgun thing: that's an interesting idea. Currently, because the bullets are drawn separately, what you'll see with the shotty is a whole bunch of numbers with different values - the highest of these being the total damage given. I could probably implement a check just using timing (i.e. are these bullets being drawn within some tiny amount of time of eachother) and then have it only show the total tally. Consider that idea noted, I'll have a look at it later on!"
Tribes,38smi6,qhp,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:34:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Let me know if you need any dev help, I'm happy to do what I can to contribute."
Tribes,38smi6,AvianIsTheTerm,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:42:53 2015 UTC,"Ensiss would be the person to ask about that, since it's his project originally. We definitely don't want to give out the source code too widely, but with the three of us at the moment, I can see benefit in having an extra person or so. Plus we have no Americans working on it currently, so it's not yet truly a 'global' project I suppose :P  If you're interested, message Ensiss about it; I can vouch that you aren't a hacker / cheat developer or whatever. All our code is hosted through a private git repo using Visual Studio Online. To be able to work with it you'd need to have a copy of VS2013."
Tribes,38smi6,vejket,2,Sun Jun 7 01:28:28 2015 UTC,"I am assuming that mod counts amount of damage done by you (to an target), and resets after certain time.

Tribes,38smi6,AvianIsTheTerm,2,Sat Jun 6 20:19:17 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's precisely how it works (I implemented this feature yesterday).  You can also set the reset time with a config variable - it defaults to 0.5 seconds, which means it will count chain, but will reset between reloads / pounds / switches. However, I believe in this video snowy has set the timeout to something massive, so it effectively just keeps counting."
Tribes,38smi6,Ensiss,4,Sat Jun 6 22:36:28 2015 UTC,"Official confirmation: this is exactly what it does. Thanks for the idea for shotguns :)  Edit: to be precise, it's not damage done to a specific target, but all damage done."

I posted on the hirez forums for that ages ago (when development still happened).  e: if possible, could you make it such that only the most recent damage number is visible? A cloud of 4 digit numbers (especially if rainbow colored, lol) might be annoying to aim through. If the previous damage number disappears when the new damage number appears it would reduce screen clutter."

Tribes,38cxi0,jesusboy76,6,Wed Jun 3 22:13:03 2015 UTC,I never understood shifter and renegade mods.. To me it was just a bunch of really overpowered weapons and deployables.
Tribes,38cxi0,sh4z,3,Wed Jun 3 17:55:52 2015 UTC,"So I was in middle school when Renegades came out and it was my first experience really doing any sort of competitive games. In a time where what you played online was early half life mods, quake, and so forth, Renegades allowed you to BUILD A BASE. It was rad. You could set all these traps and were racing the other team to get it built and keep it up faster than they could base rape it.  In practice the concept became escalatingly dumb. What could have been tuned for balance instead got tuned for ridiculousness, and pretty soon we had infinite jetpack, auto railgun ultra ren servers, and those were the norm. RIP a kinda cool concept."
Tribes,38cxi0,Shaikoten,2,Thu Jun 4 10:47:36 2015 UTC,Renegades always seemed a bit too much for me. I found shifter to be a decent balance between the faster gameplay of renegades and the slower simpler style of base. Trying to capture the flag was more of a breaking and entering strategy to get past deployables and get back out with the flag.
Tribes,38cxi0,Troutsicle,3,Thu Jun 4 18:55:17 2015 UTC,"What became Renegades and what Renegades was originally are two vastly different things. Ren used to be somewhere in between where Shifter and Base in terms of complexity and speed, and then Ultra Renegades came out, and now what people think of as Renegades is what used to be Ultra Ren. There was no standardization or anything back then, people would fork the code on a per-server level and so you could sign onto what you thought was a standard Renegades and would be like ""What the hell is this?"""
Tribes,38cxi0,Shaikoten,2,Thu Jun 4 20:13:21 2015 UTC,I was 8 years old when T1 released and would play it with my brother (Mogg) all the time.  I loved the base game but when I wasn't playing with mogg I liked to play (ultra?) renegades because it was easier for my little 8 year old gamer self.  I didn't have to worry about energy management or leading shots and stuff like that.   I also really liked the American football mod.

And I am sure you know that to be true as well...  Not that ANY of that matters... I am not here to say how good I was or wasn't.. That is just trying to answer your ""Hate Comments"" I am here to try an help bring Shifterv1G back to tribes.  Do you have that ability?  No Well the people you seem to hate for no reason...except some  ????  15 years ago someone kicked you out of a server?  I don't know...  and I don't care.   its ancient  and it's dumb.  and you really need to move on with your life. I mean if this was something that happened yesterday ...I could see you being upset.    but wow.. you hold a grudge..  I am sure you don't even know why your mad... you just spew lies about racism and it was a game.  really  how was someone racist?   did they talk bad to you in a game?  and you blame the whole community? You are too ridiculous to even respond to....  but it is soooo far out there I can't help but point out your lies. (easily I might add) The problem here for you is... I say who I was....   I can back up what I have said about being a trainer via youtube. You - don't say who you were....  you can't back up any of the lies you have typed.  iwin  -Peace"

Tribes,38dfxt,GWej,5,Wed Jun 3 21:04:27 2015 UTC,Getting a steady 60 FPS will be a big help for you. Check out the ini thread on the side bar over here --------->  I'd also recommend gradually lowering your Mouse sensitivity and possibly DPI as well to as low as you can comfortably play.
Tribes,38dfxt,doitnever,2,Wed Jun 3 16:39:04 2015 UTC,DL'd and tried most inis on the side bar. Never could get it to look like the screen shots so I figured I or the comp was too old to get it right. Most dramatic change for me was upping the refresh rate from 60 to 75. Notably sharper rendering. I guess I'll have to wait until my son builds his next gaming rig and I get his old cast-off. ;)

Tribes,38dfxt,vermice1li,3,Wed Jun 3 20:21:49 2015 UTC,"Go into target mode (super duper easy because of 0 ping). Start chaining on a moving target about 15 feet away. You should be able to hit every shot. If not, practice till you do. Then go back another 10 feet, rinse and repeat. Then move all left when you chain. Then move all right when you chain. Up, down, side ways etc. Don't stop until you get a hit with every bullet. In a pub, do the same exact thing. Makes sure you hand is relaxed. When in a dual it always helps when you move with you target but if the other person is better might not be the best move. It is always fun if you don't know the person to let them chain you out at first because they have a tendency to come for you again. Then just totally crush them everytime because they will keep coming back."
Tribes,38dfxt,NeXuid,2,Wed Jun 3 19:38:36 2015 UTC,Sounds like you've done that... worth a try!
Tribes,38dfxt,kigabit,3,Wed Jun 3 20:24:59 2015 UTC,"Try a minimalist ini.  Maximizing framerate is key to good chain.  I would suggest duck ranger's ini because he played on a toaster.  Make sure oneframethreadlag=false.  Lowering your resolution will drastically improve your framerate.  I would shoot for a solid 90 fps by lowering resolution, turn off all lights and shadows. Next turn damage numbers off, because at lower resolutions it will completely block your target, but duck used to use them and his chain was good; but he had 12 ping.  Lastly play with your sensitivity and make sure simulated proj. is on when you use magic chain. Though, at 40-60 ping, magic chain is really unnecessary."
Tribes,38dfxt,xLuftwaffel,3,Wed Jun 3 22:57:26 2015 UTC,http://pastebin.com/uXKDpM2a This ini is pretty good.  You don't need to mess with notexturestreaming with this one
Tribes,38dfxt,s1non,3,Wed Jun 3 23:03:26 2015 UTC,"My advice is that you should practice your chain with high rate of fire weapons like the NJ4, desert NJ4 or the default technician SMG. The higher ROF gives you more frequent feedback on connected hits and it helps you get used to your ping and the amount by which you need to lead your shots. It might be worth trying if you're still having trouble with the NJ5, which pretty much requires placing each bullet since the ROF is so low. If your sensitivity is low enough, you'll want to track your chain using your arm rather than with your wrist, but this is a matter of preference. Once you've got a good handle on your ping, every other projectile weapon gets much easier (close-medium range midairs will get much easier too, as a bonus).   Also, this last thing is a little beside the point, but I remember you usually roll with the DMB. I'd suggest using the jugg LMG instead if you feel like playing a heavy with a giant auto clip. The throwing discs will let you take ""free damage"" when someone isn't watching his positioning, and that's good to have if your chain still needs some work."
Tribes,38dfxt,vejket,2,Thu Jun 4 21:53:38 2015 UTC,"using magic chain wont magically make you good, im not even sure that you can b gud with 40fps ive been using mc for 2,3 days now and think it really does make chaining a bit easier"
Tribes,38dfxt,prettzl,2,Wed Jun 3 14:44:34 2015 UTC,God damn right it makes it easier. You're seeing where the bullets actually are instead of where HiRez pretends they should be in magical 20 ping fantasy land.
Tribes,38dfxt,prettzl,0,Thu Jun 4 01:50:06 2015 UTC,cough* (t00l) cough*
Tribes,38dfxt,qhp,2,Wed Jun 3 14:55:43 2015 UTC,Hi. Lower your sensitivity until your hand stops fidgeting your aim like I fidget offense then slowly work back up. Above 25cm/360 turn is good. I use around 130cm/360 but that's probably shit. A 4:3 Resolution can also make it easier to chain as targets stretched horizontally. Use simulated projectiles off if you decide not to use magic chain later. If you are nervous or have cold hands chaining will be difficult. Add a drop of lavender to your bath and soon you will soak yourself calm.

Whether the mod was injected or not, I had problems changing the loadouts via the in game menu.  My changes weren't saved when I reconnected to my profile.  You can solve it by editing all your loadouts in the .conf file. However, in game, u can edit your skins and voices with the usual loadout menu. Skin & voice of the loadout 1 applies on the 7, 8 and 9 too.   I've checked too if you could use locked weapons/loadout slots using the mod with a smurf and the answer is no."
Tribes,37yp6e,kwikkwik,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:25:08 2015 UTC,"In-game loadout change not working even when the mod is not loaded seems weird (all the mod is doing is applying the conf file to the loadout when you change class, it should be the same as manually going in the menu and changing it) but I'll take a look.  I could have just bound every loadout to in-game loadout 1 (so you'd have 9 loadout even if you unlocked only one in game) but that didn't seem very fair :3 And the not-bought items that's not me, there's a server side check preventing you to do that."

Remove it's respawn timer though, so if they neglect it, it doesn't come back on it's own.  I think that's everything. I could swear there's more, but that's probably me being tired.

Tribes,37p4c3,Lowerend,2,Fri May 29 14:08:25 2015 UTC,"Aside from Sunstar and Perma being gen dependent, simply making generators invulnerable won't solve the problem of people camping in the gen rooms.  Yes, a few might stop going there, but I would bet that most wont. Why? Because a lot of players don't go to the gen rooms because they want to defend or attack the generator, they go because it's easier for them to get kills there. If you're new to the game or just bad at it, you're going to get a lot more kills in gen rooms, because  knowing how to chain, ski or manage your energy well are not as important there. On top of all that, most of the good players very rarely go indoors, which makes gen rooms ideal for people who want to avoid running into more skillful players."

Tribes,37pmkl,Maatin,7,Fri May 29 12:12:33 2015 UTC,"It's more due to your gpu config tbh. The better nvidia hardware you have the less the game is reliant on cpu cycles. I have had a 2500k @ 4.5ghz and a 4690k @ 4.5ghz and it didn't give me any boost in fps (even though my gpu usage is 60%, cpu is 80%). I have a 7950 though so the gameworks stuff is killing me.  With that chip you may only hit 4.4ghz at a stable temp.   If you are looking to get 144fps while being mirv'd, that's not ever going to be possible."

Still only get around 110 on Arx with DL on, it's just a ridiculously bad game in terms of optimisation.   Liquid cooler will be essential, 16gb ram recommended and turn off any unneeded services."

Tribes,37llos,Schreq,3,Fri May 29 03:29:34 2015 UTC,"Please make the crosshairs customisable on a per weapon basis so you could say sniper has the chain crosshair etc. In general everything you do should have a console variable or a config setting (seems you've done that already with the DMG numbers, awesome!). I think changing the crosshairs should be pretty easy because all weapons have a crosshairs index number. Changing hud graphics is not I think because all that shit is in flash/scaleform AFAIK.  Another thing I always wished for was bringing back the stat net command. We still don't know the fucking server tick rate.  How about customisable hit sounds and maybe even kill sounds?  Edit: All the different weapon classes have a m_nReticuleIndex and m_nAltReticuleIndex for the scope. Should be quite trivial to make those customisable.  You could also fix mouse input by adding seperate sensitivity variables for the 2 zoom levels so we can disable fovscaling and use whole numbers."
Tribes,37llos,Schreq,2,Fri May 29 11:55:50 2015 UTC,"If you only mean changing the m_nReticuleIndex of the classes to use other already in-game graphics it should be easy yes. But it would be better to be able to put your own png files and use them as crosshairs...  Also, about the variables I was planning to add a scripting language into the mod (probably lua, maybe python) to handle all the variables/configs and allow for more customization (you could add the loadout randomizer directly in your config file for example). I'll probably test that someday and see if it's not too slow/big."
Tribes,37llos,s1non,2,Sat May 30 12:59:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean only being able to change m_nReticuleIndex and the zoom alt variant for all weapons. That way you could give all pistols, shotguns and sniper scopes the chain crosshair. At least for me that would eliminate the need for custom crosshairs completely and you could still tell what weapon you are holding when you disable weapons.  What happens if you hide the weapons btw.? Did you add the ammo hud you normally get in 3rd person? Otherwise you wont be able to tell what ammo you have left.  Also what do you think about the hit sound idea?"
Tribes,37llos,ticklemethere328,1 point,Sat May 30 13:39:18 2015 UTC,"The weapon hiding is currently just the same as in the normal game, just without the hand/weapon model. So yeah you don't know the ammo but even with the 3rd person hud you have no way to know the total ammo left (only the clip). The best solution would be to add a new hud or change the current one to display more info, I don't know how hard that would be.  About the sounds, what do you have in mind exactly ? It doesn't seem that useful to me, but I think I'm just missing something there."
Tribes,37llos,Schreq,1 point,Sat May 30 20:27:52 2015 UTC,It's not that useful besides customizing the game to your liking and making hitting stuff more satisfying for yourself. You can use your own hit sounds in tf2 and reflex for example and I always loved that feature.

The injector included with magic chain (winject?) will allow for multiple .dlls to be injected, so I'm assuming there's some other conflict introduced by this mod?  I know that me and many other higher ping players (including any NA ppl playing in EU or vice versa) won't use this simply for the lack of compatibility with magic chain, so if it wouldn't be too difficult to fix I think it'd be a good thing to do."

Tribes,37k1sp,_goonz_,17,Thu May 28 04:51:56 2015 UTC,The lord of a Holdfast? Pretty sure they are usually small castles on trade routes or important strategic areas etc. so they can be defended or allow safe places to stop and resupply on trips etc. Somebody responsible has to sit there and maintain that shit.
Tribes,37k1sp,jojotmagnifficent,16,Thu May 28 06:52:27 2015 UTC,"Oh shit, a Lore question! And more importantly, a touch of lore in T:A! Lemme get set up!  For this, I shall be referencing the Tribes Universe Guide (tuguide) V.2.    Holdfast  (aka Hold, Toring [SW], Polis, Vár [CoP], Arx, Chapterhouse [BE], Sentaken, Tazan, Chuo [DS])  Holdfasts are settlements where the Tribes of Man make their homes and raise their crops and families. Since terraforming and agricultural conditions are primitive enough to limit food production, holdfasts typically stock up on fundamentals in case of a siege. This wealth makes them attractive targets for raiders.  There are comfortable quarters in holdfasts, though greater effort goes into making attractive common areas for the tribesfolk to gather in. A heavy deployment of autoturrets and guards defend holdfasts. Holdfasts typically consist of a central stronghold, sentry posts, a landing pad for dropships, and a surrounding city or town. Other holdfasts may indeed be a city with several smaller citadels. However, if a settlement lacks any citadel fortification, it cannot properly be called a holdfast.  Each of the Four has its own customs and outlook regarding holdfasts. Though “holdfast” is a universal term throughout the wilderzone, the Four also substitute or add unique terms that fit within their particular culture. The Starwolf add “Toring” after a holdfast’s name if it is the primary settlement on a world and has a Thane in residence. The Children of Phoenix add Vár as a suffix to any holdfast where a Wing is stationed. The Blood Eagle add Arx as a prefix to their most heavily-fortified holdfasts. The Diamond Sword sometimes add a prefix that fits with the particular facet to which the holdfast is considered “attuned.” Many independents also add their own linguistic twists.  In terms of holdfast planning, the Children of Phoenix prefer wide streets and many public places in their spacious urban grids, whereas the Diamond Sword make theirs more temple-centered and district-oriented. The Blood Eagle maintain a strong fortress at the center of their holdfasts, a place usually called the Chapterhouse, but aside from a few main cross-streets that center on the Chapterhouse, the tribe allows a snarled knotwork of growth with few regulations. The Starwolf vary greatly, but seem to prefer compact settlements with easy access to open spaces and parks. Many Starwolf holdfasts are simply a citadel surrounded by agridomes."
Tribes,37k1sp,ShiningRayde,6,Thu May 28 14:41:37 2015 UTC,The Blood Eagle add Arx as a prefix to their most heavily-fortified holdfasts.   Damn HiRez actually did quite a bit of research

Tribes,37k1sp,wordthompsonian,3,Thu May 28 20:36:56 2015 UTC,"For the former: Sure! Follow the link and search for 'turankchart', a .zip with files for each of the major four Tribes, their rank hierarchy and force composition. I don't know T:A's ranks, so I can't say much about that... but it's possible.  As for map names, there's a few.  The Arena map name 'fraytown' is mentioned as well in the TUguide; fraytowns being the small, unconsolidated towns that form around holds and fortresses. Think towns around castles: not affiliated, but benefiting one another. They can also be temporary; firetruces often gather large enough groups of semi-permanent settlers that their temporary structures are called a fraytown in it's own right.  A few of the maps are callbacks: Raindance, Stonehenge, Canyon Crusade. Notably, in the original T1, all the maps had an official description and planet name (including maps that had lost alien technology, which is another huge point of crunch contention.)  The two named maps I can find - Bella Omega and Arx Novena - have their own fluff, but as far as I'm aware have no mention in other Tribes games."

Nothing I can think of beyond that - it's not really a rank name in the Tribes.  Ghost is... wow, okay, actually, that one has a LOT of weight behind it. A LOT.  Warlord, Colossus and Avenger are fairly generic, fluff-wise.  Immortal is another one of those terms in the Metaltech (nerdnerdnerd) universe that has quite a bit of weight behind it. The Immortals are all those who underwent the Methuselah Transfer, the creation of a organimech brain interface, installed into your own body - computer immortality. The First Emperor was one, as was Harabec, which is why at the end of Starsiege it was important to remember that Canaan brought back his brother's head. The original T1 manual had entries for each of the tribes with their general thoughts on each other, the Empire, and the immortals. Pragmatic tribes (Read: Blood Eagles) consider immortals to be nothing special - remnants of an age long past, most of them driven mad by cell memory drift. Spiritual tribes (Read: Starpony) consider them nigh unto gods, while the Children consider Harabec to be a man - but a god amongst man. Unless you're with the Harbingers, the Southern Baptist style CoP where Harabec is your lord and savior and I WILL show you his divine flame, etc etc."

Thank god someone decided to trim down a little after Starsiege: Tribes.  Also, you are now Sainted Gierling to me.   No, seriously, I got into Tribes way back in Middle School - right at the climax of it's golden age. A friend suggested this great mech game - Earthsiege - but I turned him down. Forward several years, I'm in college, and I want to get back into Tribes so I buy the bundle disc that came with Starsiege, and that offer suddenly clicked in my head. My college career was part researching psychology, part researching the Metaltech universe - I ended up building a folder of something like 70mb worth of material, from html copies of the old websites to fan art that happened to have HERCs in them. When someone on here posted a link to the Compendium, it was the closest to a full fandom freakout that I've ever had.  I've been kicking around a bunch of questions that I wanted to ask, if I should ever get the courage to hunt down Hutchins/anyone who worked on the universe... and the guys who worked on SS2845, but I've yet to figure whether that was canon or not. Was even considering posting them to this subreddit, just to let people see what a massive tool fan I am and how complex the story became, but lore rarely comes up here."
Tribes,37k1sp,ShiningRayde,1 point,Sun May 31 05:36:04 2015 UTC,"There is a ton of material out there, make sure to search for the Starsiege writers guide. There were also annotated copies with details about what happened after the Starsiege.  There were a lot of people who contributed to the lore Blake was just one. Chris Cole, Ian Christy, Jason Lennox, etc in addition to Dave Selle and all the guys that contributed to the story of all the individual games that were rolled into the universe. There were also many fans that were intimately involved such as myself, Seung Park and a lot of the guys who hung around the Writers collective (and Seung's site Datumplane). Unfortunately there was a lot of stuff that was hammered out about the nature of the universe and the various factions that was only found there.  Fair warning though, avoid the SS:2845 stuff. Blake did some work on it but Trajan misrepresented the status of the project and the disputes colored a lot of stuff. The project head made it seem that he had permission to develop an official follow on as a mod that would be published if it was popular enough. None of that story material was ever incorporated into the Universe by Cendant (or Vivendi) and was not included in what was transferred to HiRez with the IP. It's all basically fanfic that  never went anywhere.  I had to end up calling Marweas (Alex Rodberg) and getting it straight from the horses mouth that there was nothing official about it and the SS:2845 was just a pet project mod. That news is basically what killed the once great Starsiege community, a lot of people bought into it and a lot of really talented community members were turning in a TON of work because they thought they were resurrecting Starsiege.  Anyhow, bitterness aside... If you want a hard copy of the compendium buy a retail release box of Starsiege off Ebay. It came with a hardbound copy.  Anyhow if you have any specific questions feel free to PM me. I'm very strong on the ES and SS material, and the real dope on the inconsistencies in the universe, as well as the layout of the factions (especially the player factions) but I never did much if any work that touched on Tribes or was around the people that were after Dynamix folded so I probably can't expand much on whatever lore pertaining to Tribes in particular you've already found."
Tribes,37k1sp,Gierling,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:58:31 2015 UTC,"Had the Writer's Guide bundle a few years before I finally got a copy of the compendium - complete with Eviscerator's outline of The Chase era.  I apologize for making it sound like Mr. Hutchins did all the work; he just happens to headline a lot of the material as I've found it, so I've come to single out on him for most of it. I've been wary of fan-written works ever since stumbling across a few segments of Ghosts of the Antipodes - I know every fandom has it's more theme-liberal side, but that story was going well out there from what I could tell.  SS2845 and the subsequent collapse was a damn shame, but at the time (Pre-'Kickstarter') not entirely unexpected.  I'll clean up my question text file, and send them your way soon. It's been a while since I added anything to my Metaltech folder."
Tribes,37k1sp,ShiningRayde,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:08:20 2015 UTC,"Oooh that is the rare version of the writers guide, not a lot of those got into ""circulation"". (There is a more comprehensive earlier guide floating around there, but it doesn't go into the after bits as much).  I was really happy with what they decided to do post-SS, and particularly proud of what they did with the NTDF. The eventual fate of the New Terran's is something I worked on, and one of the best parts of the contemporary Siege universe IMHO.  Anyhow, even Blake would credit everyone. There were dozens if not more collaboraters. The Siege universe is one of the richest (and in my opinion Best) sci-fi universes out there. Dealing with Fan stuff comes with the territory though, a very great deal of material came from the fans. Nearly every significant player Squad (NTDF, CAN, BDU, EG, SK, WP, etc etc) ended up mentioned in Game, and incorporated into lore, we all contributed to the writers forum and formed a bit of a council that ideas were bounced off of and contributed too.  I just need to be particularly clear though about the 2845 thing, if that was a kickstarter it would have been sued out of existence by the copyright holders. This is a point that can not be more clear, Trajan lied about that project to everyone involved. There was nothing in that project which ever had a hope of making it into the canon and it's existence helped hasten the death of the property and the community.   Send over your questions, I'll answer what I can, and offer whatever additional Data I can."

Tribes,37h0f9,Dodgesabre,1 point,Wed May 27 17:02:41 2015 UTC,It's actually below 4.5-4.6 with FOV scaling on and should only be bad when you are fully zoomed in with the sniper at 20 fov(I think).
Tribes,37h0f9,Schreq,1 point,Thu May 28 04:53:27 2015 UTC,yeah but decimal numbers are bad as they have rounding errors and just cut some digits off
Tribes,37h0f9,Dodgesabre,1 point,Thu May 28 09:00:15 2015 UTC,"It's a tad different to that. Disabling FOV scaling provides the ability to get lower sens than 5 with fov scaling on(which is equal to 6 with it off). With FOV scaling on, decimals can matter and you wont have rounding errors until 4.501ish sensitivity.   Read http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/1w8ahr/ta_mousing_an_attempt_at_busting_the_below_5_sens/  And  http://pastebin.com/TDZ2ac5w"
Tribes,37h0f9,Schreq,3,Thu May 28 10:09:45 2015 UTC,"It seems people keep misunderstanding and I have to repeat it every time it comes up in a reddit post.  No matter what sensitivity you use, a whole number or not, you will always have rounding errors with fovscaling on. Only a real sens of below 1.0 will result in dead pixels, BUT ONLY when you move your mouse slower than (1.0 / real sens) mouse counts per frame. Let's say your real sens is 0.3, you wont be able to turn at all when you move your mouse at a speed of less than 4 dots/counts per frame, because 3 reported mouse counts would be 0.9 and ""rounded"" to 0. Knowing your own DPI and frame rate, you could even calculate what speed that would be."
Tribes,37h0f9,Dodgesabre,1 point,Thu May 28 14:49:33 2015 UTC,Oops I used rounding errors for the wrong explanation.   I meant with scaling on you can use decimals (like 120 fov with 5.9 sens and 6 sens would be the same sensitivity). The rounding errors occur post fov scaling calculation so if your sensitivity value in game is a decimal that could increase your sens to the next int.
Tribes,37h0f9,Schreq,2,Thu May 28 15:10:05 2015 UTC,"Decreased to the next int ;) Think just snipping everything behind the decimal point off. So you mean 5.0 and 5.9 would be the same but that is wrong as well.  What you have to understand is that the conversion to int happens every time the mouse is asked for data which is every game frame, I think. So other variables like your framerate, speed and distance of a mouse swipe affect how much data you lose. 5.0 and 5.9 could be the exact same at a very specific mouse swipe with certain fps while it differs with every other movement."
Tribes,37h0f9,sardiili,1 point,Thu May 28 15:28:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah sorry it was hard to convert thoughts into words while I was heavily medicated last night.   I mean 5.9 in game at 120 fov post fov scaling calculation it should be the same as 6 after fov calculation right? (Assuming the swipes and fps remain the consistent) Or is the int conversion is earlier? I thought it was a float until it was parsed after the fov calc.  Also, wouldn't having different mouse swipes effect it mean you pretty much have - acceleration that cannot be removed? Again assuming your fps is constant."
Tribes,37h0f9,Schreq,2,Fri May 29 02:10:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand your example correctly. At 120 fov 5.9 would be:  5.9 * 120 * 0.01111 = sens 7.86588  While 6 would be:  6.0 * 120 * 0.01111 = sens 7.9992  Close but not the same and it depends on the counts the mouse reports because that's what gets multiplied at the end. 10 counts and you would end up rotating for 78 vs 79. 1000 counts and the difference is bigger (7865 vs 7999). If you move your mouse just 1 count, then yes, it would be the same.  Regarding acceleration: I think it depends on what the result of all the calculations is at the end. A certain swipe could mean it has positive acceleration vs a slower one for the same distance. I don't think it would be very noticeable though and wouldn't always be the same acceleration across the board. Also it's not acceleration per se. It's just that faster swipes means the game gets the mouse counts in bigger chunks, meaning you lose less data so the mouse data is more correct, while on slow movements you could lose more data overall because it adds up. Losing more data means rotating less."

They fire projectiles too.  e: about your idea, it might be a better idea to advertise a mumble/TS server in the description of that pub server to make it half-pub/half-pug.

Tribes,37gj9g,mizzu704,22,Wed May 27 14:36:00 2015 UTC,"Raspe's rowdy roadhouse is the probably the best you'll get.   Honor is simply not good enough when it comes to performing certain roles that you would have in a competitive setting. As such the meta would probably be focused around 3(2) jug offense, 1(2) capper(s), 1 superheavy jug a tcn and a soldier.   The ""nail-biting"" action? run straight at the stand and groundpound everything you see until the capper gets out because the defense has no game awareness.  Then you have a standoff. If the flagholder is smart they'll just rabbit the flag as a path with 56 hp because it's not like they're going to die anyway.  There you go, that's an honor pug. Proceed to circlejerk about your 1/20 bp to kill ratio.   What you don't seem to understand is the necessary role that chain, snipe, and pistols play into an actually competitive meta. There are just too many ways to abuse something honor. So if you like it, set up a voip with Raspe's nerds or play on Swordfish's LT server with no chain.  Why should anyone else set it up for you?"

He has since joined us again and is always welcome as long as he doesn't abuse.  Chain has always been looked at as a last resort for the guy with 50 hp that's rabbiting or does a lightweight disk jump off the stand.  I also apologize on behalf of those who tried tunneling you with chain.  It was wrong of them and are not the type of people we want around the mixers.  I'm guessing you are talking about me with the K outs?  I was probably having less fun than you were...  Here's a guy coming into my house and breaking all my stuff.  I'm disappointed you left the mixers for good, you are a nice guy and I wish you would have just taken the hint and conformed to our play-style rather than sticking to pug rules inside of the mixers."
Tribes,37gj9g,wordthompsonian,3,Wed May 27 14:09:35 2015 UTC,"I was there when potty was banned for shocklancing. In the TS server. We were on Drydock, he was playing shocklance PTH and he got kicked.   As for the people who are morons about chain, in pubs mainly because I haven't mixed in a while, Gorthaur and Tiki were the main offenders. It had progressed to a point where, if I was on the enemy team, tiki/gorth would deliberately single me out and kill me midfield. Whatever, I can make easy work of them, and I have thick skin. The last straw came a few months ago where I was once ""accidentally"" team killed by gorthaur, then again I was playing on Bella, same team as tiki and gorth, on enemy stand for a return, and tiki flew by and team-killed me with a shocklance. THAT is why I quit for good. Despite Iceman inviting me all the time, I never felt welcome with those two around and I decided they could have their fun and I could continue playing Tribes without getting singled out.  I used to play honour only, I liked it, back when we had enough people interested to actually pick teams in TS and play 2-4 hours of good Tribes. Unfortunately for me, that welcome was worn out as I became a better player and (it seemed) everyone else got stubborn.  I might consider returning if base assets are disabled and turrets and mines are banned, and I don't think that is too much to ask or imposing my pug rules, it just makes for better play."
Tribes,37gj9g,Razgrisss,2,Thu May 28 00:54:14 2015 UTC,"As other people have said in this thread, cappers are overpowered in an honor server.  Base Turrets, Turrets and Mines being enabled are to establish a balance by limiting the damage done by the offense.  They will not be disabled now or in the future because they are key in helping the defense stay alive to catch cappers when they come in.  In all honesty, they aren't much of a threat especially when you aren't being chained/sniped, no base turret upgrades are available and there are more players than 7v7.  As for Potty, I was there too and I know for a fact it was the Rhino because I was one of the ones complaining.  Also, it wasn't a one weekend thing.  This was the accumulation of a few weekends of abuse.  There's no possible way anyone would be kicked out for using shocklance path...  Mind as well kick half the players in mixers.  As for Gorthaur and Tiki, like I said before you were chaining everyone as if it was a pug match and within their own server.  What they did was wrong, but you full well knew the expectations of the server, especially being a previous honor only player.  You may have become a better player in pugs (Most likely outside of pugs as well), but you should know Pug loadouts and rulesets are designed to give the most killing power.  This heavily imbalances an mixer game and when you are the only one doing it people are going to get salty, me included.  You should show up again though!  We usually have full mixers for at least 3 games on Saturdays.  Just meet people half way and try our ruleset.  You might be surprised."
Tribes,37gj9g,scrambler_jumper,4,Wed May 27 15:07:52 2015 UTC,"to establish a balance by limiting the damage done by the offense   you've already done that by removing chain  if offense is groundpound only it is much harder to advance on the defense - who more than likely have cover and positioning in their favor  so you, as offense, try to be strategic in your approach to the defense, and get knocked off path and taken to half health by an auto aim turret.   and if your offense manages to kill the 5 LW chasers on stand (which is the norm for this server) then the barrage of deployables will get your capper anyway  i played on this server for the longest time but the base assets/deployables finally killed the fun for me. literally no incentive to do anything other than LW chase and get those glory plates. server gets stale because you sit on stand with no offensive pressure waiting for 1 or 2 cappers with a team of chasers.  maybe it could work if the entire server was offense-oriented but that is definitely not the case"
Tribes,37gj9g,Razgrisss,1 point,Wed May 27 19:19:36 2015 UTC,"I apologize, my earlier posts with Thompson was in regards to our mixer servers which are not fully “honor” servers like the RD public one.  Poor choice of adjective for the server on my part.  The only thing banned are sentinels and smoke grenades.  Upgrades for base assets and tacticals/orbitals are turned off as well.  They are private servers reserved for our mixer community, who place more emphasis on larger groups (10+ vs 10+), flag play and discourage the use of chain/pistols unless it’s as a finisher.  We do play with lower numbers, like 7v7, later in the night after the majority of people leave but smaller games aren’t nearly as fun.  Anyways, onto your comment.  Offense benefits from no chain as well.  Without the killing potential of chain/pistols/snipers the offense tends to live longer and realistically none of them need to be right on top of the stand and within turret range.  LW chasers need to stick close to the stand or at least in a potential rage jump location so they can't perform as a PUG LD would by eliminating the enemy offense.  On top of that the defense has to keep track of 2-4 cappers, which is almost impossible to time correctly while being shot at by mortars and medium offense.  Finally, when a capper does get out all of the lights have left to chase leaving the remaining defense to get slaughtered by the offense.  Offense shouldn't K out because they need to be within 5 seconds of the flag stand for an e-grab because the situation can be turned around very easily.  Within the mixer servers, base turrets, technician turrets (rare) and mines are necessary otherwise the defense lacks the firepower to push the offense off the stand.  This may be a bad example, but the RD server used to have no base turrets but it became a game of who has the more dominating offense, so even if a capper went for a 5-10 second grab to cap, the enemy offense was already camped on the stand to e-grab it."
Tribes,37gj9g,Kirotera12,2,Wed May 27 23:49:36 2015 UTC,"Hey now, we can't ask someone to meet us halfway if we don't try to meet them halfway too. Maybe taking away base assets and leaving mines could make the gameplay better? It sounds like a good match for me. Most of the time, base assets don't even stop or hit cappers, and having mines only allows cappers to destroy some of them before hitting the stand. This gives a chance to the offense and also keeps cappers in the air. Just a suggestion worth trying out for a while. You can see how it works for a while and if you don't think it's working out, you can switch it back. Honor is a niche playstyle inside of a niche game. We can't ask people to join us and not try to meet what they want from a game they love as much as we do.  E: phrasing"
Tribes,37gj9g,Razgrisss,1 point,Thu May 28 00:02:37 2015 UTC,"We can try it if there's interest, but it's already been tested in mixers.  What happens is exactly what I said in the other post, offense overruns defense, capping becomes impossible, flag stand is full of red."
Tribes,37gj9g,Kirotera12,1 point,Thu May 28 00:42:26 2015 UTC,"But then again, if it's 7v7 and they have a lot of O then their D isn't strong. Idk, lots of ways to think about it and counter whatever happens (as a team of course) Like if there is more enemy O when the enemy flag is grabbed, instead of trying to rush in and cap it off, - which would be near impossible if there were enemies on stand - two or three teammates could defend the capper, two chase the enemy flag capper if there was one, and the rest could go beast mode on the enemy offense. Well coordinated play like that can be hard though, but a mixer has TS so it isn't impossible to accomplish."

EDIT: If you think that flag play can't happen on these types of servers, you're wrong. Maybe it can't for you but it can for others.

Tribes,37gj9g,AvianIsTheTerm,4,Sun May 31 19:54:22 2015 UTC,"Maybe it can't for you but it can for others.   If by others you mean ""people who can't cap"", then sure.  The guy is calling for some 'organised / high level honour', when 'organised / high skill level' is literally the antithesis of 'honour' play.  It's like if you played counterstrike and got mad every time someone told you you couldn't both play at a high level and do nothing but P90 rush. The two things are just incompatible."

The implication is that he wants to play an organised game while ignoring the mechanics that make it possible to have such games. Numerous others have pointed out why organised honourfusor is never going to work if you've got anyone who can cap."
Tribes,37gj9g,Kirotera12,1 point,Fri May 29 14:55:09 2015 UTC,Agreements could be made to make chasers the only ones using chain. Compromise is a thing.
Tribes,37gj9g,AvianIsTheTerm,3,Wed May 27 21:54:23 2015 UTC,"That wouldn't really be 'disc only CTF' then, though, would it?    Even if it worked, that's such a hack-y solution to a problem that is solved by learning to use other weapons; it's starting with a basis that you're going to only use a small subset of the game mechanics and then wondering why you run into huge balance issues.    In other words, OP here is blaming the community for his hangups over chain. If he got gud and went outside his little honourscrub bubble, then the inherent problems with disc only organised games wouldn't even matter, because he'd be able to play a real organised game.    But 'honour' players rarely can look outside that box; it's a great example of the Dunning-Kruger effect in action - it's not just being ignorant about the game mechanics, it's being ignorant enough that they don't even know that they're ignorant of these mechanics, and can't see the broader picture of how chain (along with other mechanics) is balanced."

I wish Hi-Rez had made it easier for us to find servers, I wish they'd created an explosives-only mode and given it some preference (since the Spinfusor was created by God and he saw that it was good, and then he tried to cash in on Trobes gold for a bunch of other crap), I wish they'd have made a mode where mid-airs counted (insta-gib) and there was no ground/splash damage, but they didn't. So we do what we can.  And for the record, when I play Far Cry 4, I use the mother-scratching bow and arrow. Cause I like it. It's more difficult and it's cooler."

So finally after about 6 months of hashing out ideas for formats, scripts, content and everything in between, GWej and I have put together the first of our Tribes GuidesTM videos. We hope these videos will help new and old players alike. If you see anyone in-game who could use some pointers, please refer them to our videos so everyone can have a better gaming experience.  This particular video is quite basic, and will likely be stale to the majority of you the reddit community, but that doesn't mean you can't pass them on to newbies who could use a little help.   If you have any suggestions for future videos please let myself or GWej know, we do have a pretty full docket of material we want to cover.  We hope this video series is informative and helpful for anyone who plays T:A, and for any niche video guides like sniping and capping, we hope to get some guests on to speak from their perspective, we understand we are not the experts here.  HUGE thanks to Achus for hooking us up with the animation in the intro, you rock bud.  Thanks for watching!"

I mean, when you're just focusing offence and the offence can't reach you cause you're hidden among 5 dooms and 3 inf d isn't very fun.   For me, the main rule in pub is : if i play like that, would anyone have fun? I try to not chain out lvls 10 (i'm bad at chain anyway), to not kill chasers who go for MA, etc..."

Tribes,374prc,mizzu704,9,Mon May 25 17:46:05 2015 UTC,When sniping in a pub you need to ask yourself a few questions:   Are cappers coming in with such speeds and regularity that without a check they'll cap out in a few minutes? Is the HOF overburdened trying to prevent cappers from grabbing and offense from egrabbing/llamaing? Are your chasers unable to keep up with the routes being used? Is the enemy offense manhandling your defense? Is your offense nonexistent/unable to retrieve the flag?   If you cannot answer yes to any of these questions then its a good idea to play a different role as all you're doing is tormenting a crippled team. When they're able to fight back pick up sent and go hog wild.
Tribes,374prc,THEM0RNlNGW00D,7,Sun May 24 22:37:29 2015 UTC,"Sentinels can be legitimately pretty frustrating in pubs, because 9/10 times they're not actually trying to do their 'job' and are just d-stacking.  If you want to get better, and you're legitimately spotting cappers then go for it, and damn what pubbies think. But before you do, take a look at what your defence is like - if half your team are on D already (and ESPECIALLY if there are other snipers), then you're probably just making the game awful for the other side.  If you want to learn sentinel 'properly', you should try to pug in your region, or at least go onto your region's mumble voice server and ask for help from people there. Most of the time in pubs nobody is capping, and you're unlikely to really get much better by pub-sniping. People on mumble though may be happy to go into a server with you and show you where to spot, general tips and so forth."

Tribes,374prc,OceanSheep,2,Sun May 24 22:56:20 2015 UTC,"Sents are usually alone, so if someones gonna try to deal with you,  it is kind of imperative they will need to focus on you. Don't take it personally.  I tend to focus on sentinel harassment (non-verbal) primarily because I love the mortar and spamming the flagstand is boring.  Also, if the sents are on some hill away from other action, there's usually no-one else bothering, which is not fun for cappers or anyone else except maybe the snipper (although I can't see how sitting alone on a hill clicking dots could be anything else than boring but whatever floats your boat).  Anyway, while many snippers seem to enjoy friendly dueling shenanigans, the amount of whiny / delusional snipers thinking I'm focusing on them for personal reasons, trolling or something, is just mind boggling. Oh, you didn't get your rampage / relentless this game, boohoo. It's multiplayer game, if you can't handle people, you know, attacking and playing the game, maybe you should stick to minesweeper or whatever.   My advice for you would be, just play what you like, but maybe try and stay close to the action, keep moving etc, so other players will find you more... ummm.. approachable/good sport. No-one (except me) likes to walk 1000 miles for a single opponent only to die to what is one of the most annoying/best chain hoses in the game (falcon). Equipping pewpew gun (nova blaster) instead will earn you insta-respect, too.   If you keep getting killstreaks without dueling anybody, you probably really are ruining the game for others, that's just unfortunate fact. I'm not saying it's your fault; Maybe the other team sucks, you are too skilled for that game, or the other team is all just whiny little bitches, whatever. But if you care about fun in PUBs, and see you are doing maybe too well, you could considering doing something a bit different, stay near flagstand, go O for a change, ask for a driver and hop in a Grav, attack the gen with pewpew, harass the enemy sents, switch teams or something :)"

Tribes,374prc,DarcseeD,3,Sun May 24 21:36:26 2015 UTC,"In pubs, sent is 2nd most impactful role, and incredibly easy. Is it rude? No, of course not, it's a pub, there is no etiquette. Do your thing. And if you're getting hate in the chat, you know you're doing well.  Additionally, it is baffling to me how the players who complain about sentinel do NOTHING to mitigate the effectiveness of a decent sentinel. For instance they run the same stupid PTH routes, dj themselves, etc. instead of running low-vis routes, SLD cap, hop in a shrike, dedicate a SLD/RDR to contest the sniper. If you want to snipe in a more competitive environment, check out pugs."
Tribes,374prc,PragMalice,6,Sun May 24 21:47:51 2015 UTC,"Is it rude? No, of course not, it's a pub, there is no etiquette. Do your thing. And if you're getting hate in the chat, you know you're doing well.   I very much disagree with this. First of all, of course there's etiquette, or rather, just common sense. Things like not abusing players who are clearly less skilled than you, not interfering when it's clear two people are just trying to duel and it's not effecting the rest of the match, filling the roles correctly instead of stubbornly playing whatever you like the most, etc.  And getting hate does not mean you're doing well, it means you've made another player angry. Whether or not that anger is justified is the question. It could be that you just playing really well is causing them frustration, but it could also be that you're D-steacking, O sniping against a weaker team, playing with a smoke nade INF, etc.  I hate when people cite making others angry as an indication of doing well. It creates such a toxic environment in games.   Additionally, it is baffling to me how the players who complain about sentinel do NOTHING to mitigate the effectiveness of a decent sentinel.   You realize we're talking about PUBs here, right? The SENs are usually tucked behind a heavy D-stack and there's often more than one of them. Sure, you can put in the effort to focus down the best SEN on the enemy team, but then there's even less players fighting off the rest of the defenders, clearing the stand and trying to cap. Besides, taking out the SEN for 10 seconds is meaningless, since there's such a small chance that this tiny time window will be used by an uncoordinated offence and capper (if there is one).   For instance they run the same stupid PTH routes, dj themselves, etc. instead of running low-vis routes, SLD cap, hop in a shrike, dedicate a SLD/RDR to contest the sniper.   Again, we're talking pubs, not pugs here. How are new players supposed to get into capping when the enemy team is D-stacked and there are several SENs constantly pinging them? In order to get good at running low-vis routes and anything more fancy a player needs to get good at the basics, which can be very frustrating if a good SEN is constantly shutting you down, and the few times you do go unspotted, there's two DMB's and a myriad of mines and force fields on the stand."
Tribes,374prc,GWej,2,Mon May 25 09:22:26 2015 UTC,"There are also maps where ""low vis"" is literally impossible vs. any sniper worth his salt (let alone using tweaked inis to maximize visibility of jet trails). SLD/RDR capping is the only thing that even remotely approaches being viable, and only if able to do so at considerable speed with a stand bereft of any other defenders/mines and getting lucky with someone randomly killing the competent SEN at an opportune moment.  Bottom line, SENs are broken and a competent one not only decides games, but literally crushes the opposition to the point that it's simply not worth playing against.  Mind you, there's tons of other retardedly broken aspects of the game that people should rightly get pissed off about... but SEN is easily the worst of the bunch."
Tribes,374prc,Wengatang69,2,Wed May 27 04:38:18 2015 UTC,I was afraid of not being skilled enough for PUG's.  I'll check them out per your advice.  Thanks!
Tribes,374prc,beerrun1,4,Sun May 24 23:59:40 2015 UTC,I suggest playing some other role (like offense) if you are new entirely to pugs. Sentinel is so important in 7v7s that it's not the best place to start.
Tribes,374prc,rgzdev,1 point,Mon May 25 01:30:21 2015 UTC,While it is not rude to play sent offensive is going to harass you constantly. In PuGs (competitive) for example the 3 offense players usually target the sniper first going 3v1 or if the LD shows up 3v2. In pubs the better you are playing the more the offense will go for you because of your success. If inf becomes a problem just use the drop jammer I guess. Just don't be surprised when a soldier chases you done for an entire map because that is just the role of offense
Tribes,374prc,luola,1 point,Sun May 24 21:47:08 2015 UTC,"Even in pubs, it's best to have the pug roles filled. When I'm joining a pub, I'll HOF if no DB, then snipe if no sent. I'm a bad sniper, but bad is better than none. If another shows up, I'll move on to another role."

Tribes,374prc,Rynex,1 point,Sun May 24 23:35:15 2015 UTC,"One thing I try to do if I use sentinel is to not use the scope for shooting. I try to spot the cappers normally, but when they are in reasonable range I try to shoot them without scoping in. Of course you need phase rifle for this to be effective, but that is one way of leveling the playing field. IMO it balances quite well the skill of less experienced cappers to the effectiveness of sentinel."

Tribes,374prc,ticklemethere328,1 point,Mon May 25 20:09:56 2015 UTC,"Is it considered rude to play sentinel in public servers?   To some people. Sentinel suffers from the age old problem of ""snipers being cheap and overpowered"" creatures, so naturally people get mad.   Where can I improve my skills with the sentinel class?   PUGs.  Also, in Pubs: Make sure you taunt VGTB after every kill, it's like hitting people beyond the grave."
Tribes,374prc,Obyeag,1 point,Mon May 25 14:47:09 2015 UTC,"Today another player actually followed me between games with an infiltrator, then shocklanced me every single game relentlessly, while ignoring everyone else. After this happened it got me thinking, Is it considered rude to play sentinel in public servers?   yes going against a sniper can be annoying in pub but there is never ever a reason to do that to anyone regardless of what they are doing. You are not the problem, he is."
Tribes,374prc,Will12239,1 point,Mon May 25 16:12:11 2015 UTC,"I dislike sentinels, but is it rude to play sentinel in public servers? No. Like pretty much any class, it depends how you play it. Don't focus someone half of the game. Also, don't stop cappers on their routes constantly. I'm sure that's no fun, and there's no reasonable defense against it in a pub.  If you get decent at any class and do well in a pub server where most players are not very skilled, expect to get negative comments and cheat accusations. This happens in nearly any FPS, as the average player is teens or mid-twenties and not a social butterfly."

The teller asks his name and the frog says that his name is Kermit Jagger, his dad is Mick Jagger, and that it is OK, he knows the bank manager. Patty explains that $50,000 is a substantial amount of money and that he will need to secure some collateral against the loan. She asks if he has anything he can use as collateral.  The frog says, ""Sure. I have this,"" and produces a tiny pink porcelain doll, about half an inch tall. A vibrant pink and perfectly formed.  Very confused, Patty explains that she'll have to consult with the manager and disappears into a back office. She finds the manager and says: ""There is a frog called Kermit Jagger out there who claims to know you and wants to borrow $50,000. And he wants to use this as collateral."" She holds up the tiny pink doll. ""I mean, what in god's name is this?""  The bank manager looks back at her and says, ""It's a knick knack, Patty Whack.

Tribes,36x6in,Meremothy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:15:38 2015 UTC,"Well there's two of my favorite players in the same dag-gum thread, yessir!    I do agree with variable about thinking the hate was silly.  This community was a strange one, that's for sure, but very entertaining in its hey-day.    It honestly just seemed like youngin's piggybacking off of some weird harsh teasing of Buhlitz that carried over from Tribalwar.  Those TW people are a complete and total breed of their very own.  I've been involved in tons of different PC gaming communities for a long time, and haven't seen anything quite like those people.  But some people are just dicks, most of 'em cowards, and the cowardly dicks will all gang up on the same person because they feel more secure in numbers.  Buhlitz was one of the main people I played with, and I've spent hundreds of hours talking to him on VoIP, and a lot of you guys know I don't have much tolerance when it comes to assholes, and I can assure you, Buhlitz wasn't an asshole.  He was actually a very cool guy, easy to talk to, and I've personally seen him, several times, respond to noobie players that had questions or problems that he tried and help.  I saw it first hand.  TW, a good chunk of some T:A players, and even his own fucking team treated him like dogshit for no apparent reason.  It's one thing when it's just some kids purposefully being trolls, but it's a totally different thing when it turns into vitriolic hatefulness, especially considering the time and energy some of these guys put into making the attacks personal.  It was mob-mentality.    The mistake Buhlitz made was responding to some of it in defense instead of just completely ignoring those people.   That just gave 'em more fuel for the fire.   But, I tell yah what, it did make for some awesome drama, entertainment, and comp games."

Bowie's a solid player when he's not trying to captain and micromanage, but he always tries to captain. Regardless, I feel he's smarter at captain/coach than he is powerful at any particular role. There was no one else like him in T:A. I listened and participated in other top teams' scrims and discussions, and no one was as thorough or logical as Bowie's approach to playing competitively.  edit: I'd also like to point out that he is the only egocentric player on my team, so everyone else on our team was demoted to a not-anything position."

Tribes,36wmri,Melur,3,Fri May 22 19:26:16 2015 UTC,"Dat morale raising ""trash talk"". When Tribes was dying/dead (2013-onwards) we had to entertain ourselfs in some way. Why not at the expense of others? :D   Honestly though, Trickz is underrated. He is the complete package as a player, it's just hard to see when you're not on his team.  He would probably be on my dream team aswell."
Tribes,36wmri,Ephixx,6,Sat May 23 13:05:14 2015 UTC,Underrated? He's probably the most overrated player ever.    it's just hard to see when you're not on his team.   How can you be sure it's not the same thing with a lot of other players who haven't been on your team?
Tribes,36wmri,Melur,1 point,Sat May 23 16:52:05 2015 UTC,"How can you be sure it's not the same thing with a lot of other players who haven't been on your team?   Don't get me wrong, the same thing can be said for alot of players from other teams.     Underrated? He's probably the most overrated player ever.    Calling Trickz overrated implies he is rated higher than he should be. I've always been under the impression that he wasn't rated high at all, atleast by people not involved with our team. He hardly showed up on people's best lists nor was he praised often. I feel like most people (mis)judged him by his antics on reddit which don't reflect his skills ingame. Therefor calling him overrated, or even the most overrated player ever is a massive exaggeration.  When he joined Vertigo I was against it. I rated him far lower than what would be required to join [v] aswell. But the guy showed excellent mentality and played really well during [v]'s possibly  most dominate period  in the game. When you are    the most overrated player ever    you don't do stuff like that."
Tribes,36wmri,Ephixx,3,Sat May 23 18:23:58 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm misremembering but I thought I had seen people from outside of Vertigo mention him in these type of threads. Even still, I remember a thread where I think it was Knutsson that ranked Trickz as high as top5. At the time I thought it was just meant to be a confidence builder for the newest player on the team but seeing his name mentioned twice already in this thread I'm starting to think he was serious. Come on, Trickz wasn't even the 5th best player on your team (Knutsson, Matin, BrainD, You, bins)... he wasn't even the best player on klimaxx when he left (Barrel, Dropkik)...  He may have been a good fit for your team and a great teammate but I feel it's pretty safe to say he was overrated."
Tribes,36wmri,Melur,3,Sat May 23 19:23:20 2015 UTC,"If this was a best player per position thread it would've been different, but it isn't.   It's a dream team thread, so I need to pick players who are likely to play well together with each other, not the players who are the ""best"". And there are 3 offensive positions so it's not like I choose him over someone else, I choose him with 2 others.   Trickz is like the type of player in an offensive team who fills in the gaps other players leave. He's flexible enough to take a different role. He was excellent at on the spot adapting to situations. That kind of depth in gameplay is not easy to recognize for both the opposing team or VOD watchers.   A great example of this was his offense play during Raindance in the EUTL S3 Finals which probably was the key factor in us winning.  So basically what I'm trying to say is that his contribution to a team isn't something you easily observe nor qualify above or below others. You could call his skill a form of gamesense, and that is a skill I rate very highly and would always want on my team.  I don't regard the [xXx] Trickz to be the same player as the [v]Trickz, as he improved significantly when he joined. (As do many other players when they leave their lower level teams to join a top team)  I also doubt Knutsson would praise Trickz with the purpose of building his confidence, he isn't like that. He probably saw the same qualities I saw in Trickz.  edit: sp"
Tribes,36wmri,Ephixx,3,Sat May 23 21:04:29 2015 UTC,"This post is exactly what I mean when I say he is the most overrated player ever.  Sure, it's a dream team thread. If you really like the guy and want to play with him put him on your team. Since Tattie didn't list himself on his team (even though he is a way better player in every aspect) I don't think that's what he was going for. Creating a team with 3 offense slots and putting Trickz in one of them over players like Kennet, Matin, bins, sh4z, t00l, lov3 is laughable."
Tribes,36wmri,Melur,3,Sat May 23 21:29:45 2015 UTC,"That's because you don't seem to see Tribes in the same way we do. We often joked in [v] that we didn't play the same Tribes: Ascend other people play (figuratively) and this reply is confirming that, seeing as you rate players based on a different (seemingly more superficial) skillset.  It also seems like you're implying that I (over)rate him due to him being my friend? I tend to see past that and am very critical and direct about such matters. I've always been very critical of my teammates/friends to the point of one even leaving the team. That's harsh but that's who I am and I don't see a reason why I would rate Trickz less objectively than others.  And besides, I'm not the only one regarding Trickz as a top player. If all of us internally attested/confirmed his skill, isn't it the external(your) opinion which is lacking?   As I mentioned before, our results speak for themselfs. With Trickz in offense we played better as a team than without. When a new player joins and adds a considerable increase in quality results in a super critical team as [v], I can't not put his name out there.   Dreamteam  I don't think putting Trickz as 1/3 in a dreamteam offense would be laughable at all. If he added something to [v] he would add something to a dreamteam aswell."
Tribes,36wmri,J4ckTh3Bl4ck,3,Sat May 23 22:17:45 2015 UTC,"isn't it the external opinion which is lacking?   just lol   Trickz in offense we played better as a team than without   No, you didn't.   If he added something to [v] he would add something to a dreamteam aswell.   He didn't add anything to your team that a ton of other players wouldn't have, he was the 7th wheel playing the least important position where you can easily hide a lacking player.   our results speak for themselfs.   I'd like to remind you of s4 where you actually put Trickz in a key role and you forfeit the season because you realized that he would never be able to play at the level you needed him to.  Laughably overrated."
Tribes,36wmri,ArmoredPenguin94,1 point,Sat May 23 22:55:31 2015 UTC,"No, you didn't   In between S2/S3 continuing into S3, coincidentially right after Trickz joined (and we tried Crossfire again) we had the most dominant period of playing. It's something I still remember clearly, as my uni schedule freed up quite a bit of time and I could play a bit more again.   Besides, I doubt you know as much as I do about my team. Results, let alone gameplay itself.   He didn't add anything to your team that a ton of other players wouldn't have, he was the 7th wheel playing the least important position where you can easily hide a lacking player.   I don't regard any of the 7 positions capable of ""easily"" hiding a lacking player. The way we played didn't allow that, the team didn't allow that, I didn't allow that. Don't you think we would've known if he we really had a 7th wheel in the team? Like we had known with L B?   The multitude of players back then were brainless fraggers, the more experienced ones were even worse as the chance to change them to fit the way we play was significantly less. Even I didn't see it in him at the start, I was against him joining. But I can happily admit I was wrong.   I'd like to remind you of s4 where you actually put Trickz in a key role and you forfeit the season because you realized that he would never be able to play at the level you needed him to.   You can't qualify someone's offensive skills as overrated and then give their HoFing as an example, that way you can make anyone look bad. Besides you know that's not why we quit, if anything the results pre-togglebox relevation showed promise.  I expected you to disagree, that's obviously fine. But the replying with basic one liners, making up reasons and comparing uncomparable positions kinda ruined it for me. That's not worth replying to anymore."

Tribes,36p024,wrightrj,6,Thu May 21 00:02:31 2015 UTC,"You can fully disable fog in training/roam mode. Not an intended feature, but you can. EDIT: Dug up my old spreadsheed, Show FOG as a command on a bind in TribesInput.ini will accomplish this. I believe that after activating it once in roam mode, you will be unable to enter online servers until you restart your game (don't quote me on this, it's just from personal experience but the servers were extremely shit at this time). Example on DX NOTE: All of these commands ONLY work in roam/training mode. NONE of them in multiplayer games.  Lowering gamma will allow you to see further through fog at the cost of a darker game.  I expect the videos you've found are of low gamma, very tweaked inis, roam servers, or hacks. Got an example? That would be helpful.  Also note that fog is a game-play mechanic designed to balance flatter maps, or maps where the sniper vantage point tends to be the highest point on the map (Stonehenge, Dangerous Crossing, Permafrost). It's not just a visual thing the devs added in for shits and giggles."

And yes, the expansion stuff sorta killed the game, but the early days were indeed something special.  (Is is just sequel-itis? Can any of these remakes and reboots ever really capture the feeling of the original games? Sometimes I wonder. Hell, even this list has WolfET but not the superior RtCW. I'd like to think there is more at work here than just nostalgia, however.)"

Developers of games like the original Halo and UT2k4 credit Tribes for breaking those barriers and ""showing them the path"" (not in so few words). The game sold 250k copies in a gaming realm with way less players than we have today. It also was pirated at least 750,000-1 million more times since it was 120 meg install that didnt require the disc to play. They identified over 1 million Unique players in the games run. Its Competition ladder reached 125 teams where even being in the top 25 was considered a big sucess, and when OGL stumbled the game was big enough to drive a new gaming platform under the TWL Banner, which later hosted like 30-40 other games.

I want to thank every single one of you Tribes players for keeping this game alive, so long that even someone like me, who started playing competitive at the end of season 4, can play this game untill now. I wasnt sure about my capping skills at the beginning but some people kept telling me that I am a good capper. Thank you <3  One player was suprised that I havent played this game that long and he told me that I will turn into a beast cap if I continue practicing. Special thats to that player. You are the reason I kept on playing as a capper! :D  I also want to thank for all the great feedback of my earlier montages, thats kept me motivated to create more montages. It was so much fun to play this game with this awesome community and i will never forget this time :D  Last but not least:  Krampo and Shaquon, thank you guys for being so good friends in and outside of the game and keep telling me that I am the best <3  Flex"

It was a ridiculous and asinine argument, as Vehicles Never were apart of LT in any previous iteration of the game, for specifically that reason - not balanced."

Tribes,35n4bd,MKRWSeek,1 point,Mon May 11 21:45:56 2015 UTC,To nerf capper speed since there is no sentinel.
Tribes,35n4bd,scrambler_jumper,3,Mon May 11 21:52:35 2015 UTC,Yeah but wouldn't a chaser with rage/lightweight catch up to a capper running lightweight in no time. Unless the capper is running 10 min setups
Tribes,35n4bd,sh4z,1 point,Mon May 11 23:24:07 2015 UTC,"He could, but unless he's snooks he probably wouldn't kill offense in time with LW instead of Quickdraw. Also most cappers run routes that are hard(er) to chase than a lot of routes spammed in pubs"
Tribes,35n4bd,scrambler_jumper,2,Tue May 12 00:55:33 2015 UTC,"Regardless you can only get going so fast with lightweight if you wanna hit the flag in under 5 mins and have more than 250 health. Any capper with 250 health is going to get chain spammed in an instant; especially since he likely won't be over the 300km/h mark, if that.   I haven't seen many, if any, routes designed around running lightweight.   It's certainly interesting and I'm all about LT but I don't know if banning ego would make it any better"
Tribes,35n4bd,-notacanadian,5,Tue May 12 01:59:24 2015 UTC,"a capper would (almost) never run lighteweight, I'm not sure where you got that idea from.  With quickdraw and 1 explosive nitron setup you can still grab at ~250 speed full health on a 20-30 sec route, which is pretty much what you'd like in LT.  The problem when you allow ego in LT is the super visible mega high routes that you cant shoot down, grabbing at 400+ and being unchaseable"
Tribes,35n4bd,MKRWSeek,2,Tue May 12 11:14:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah after reading what I wrote I'm not sure either. I was really baked and thought you needed to use lightweight.  I still think, though, that a chaser with rage/lightweight will wreck a capper not running ego. It's a tough balance to find and certainly not one that Hi-Rez ever came close to."

Tribes,35n4bd,kigabit,3,Thu May 14 23:49:00 2015 UTC,"Remember that we're also using a custom physics preset, so your current notions of capper/chaser speed don't apply.  This is why we really need to test all these settings to see what, if any, needs tweaking.  Also, because of this, getting to your capper to escort will be a much faster thing - by the time a chaser has caught up to the out-capper, his teammates will probably be near.  The fun of LT is in the speed, the cluster and flag play."
Tribes,35n4bd,qhp,3,Tue May 12 02:14:10 2015 UTC,"The fun of LT is in the speed, the cluster and flag play.   Totally agree. But wouldn't the physics changes be relative?

Small, but fairly active for a  (not so) dead game. Drafts quite often (one per month and now a bit less since exams). Pugs are still played i think.   Anything else I should know?

The remaining playerbase might be too small to argue that 'if one cannot play now, he plays then'. The drafts would need as many ppl as possible anyway.  How about a scheme like this: bi-monthly, EU and NA one after the other. Like this, EU and NA have 6 official drafts per year,  ..and if some players would like to play more often, they can join drafts on the other continent, what is actualy done very often already."

Had a server and everything.   Everyone has/had a great time at Monday Night Blitz, even PUG players, but the second someone not traditionally a comp player like CAS brought up something new? Nope, not happening ur a shitter, despite mstarr even wanting to try it.    You're all a bunch of hypocrites, and now that our PUGs are getting as stale as a loaf of whole wheat bread in an American household you suddenly decide it's a great idea.    God dammnit.    Anyways, I'm clearly all for this. Despite flag location changing the O/D dynamic, we have way more routes to come up with for cappers, more places for hitboxing snipers to look for those routes, an injection of change into our boring maps, making maps like Drydock more viable, and a general change that might get more players out in mumble.   As for cap limits, I still think 5 is the way to go. This is 7 v 7 not a 14 v 14 Monday Night Blitz pub - the #5 flag location is not nearly as bad with fewer players, and we could consider banning fractals on the maps/in these pugs. We already don't have deployables and mines - I simply don't think it's going to be a problem  Either way, playtest, I will happily donate a server if we need one."

Tribes,354yfy,persuasionlaser,1 point,Thu May 7 16:32:17 2015 UTC,Nah I disagree. You can do actual speedy routes with the locations as they are.   Think about the standard front left from beagle perspective and how easy it is to spot/snipe. By changing the route by 1 hill you can ski down the tower hill to grab probably 310-320.   I think the difficulty is just in the route creation. The speed should be the same and it doesn't change offense runs really.   PS there's a really op bounce that lets you run a back but bounce down in front of the base to pick the flag. The possibilities are endless.
Tribes,354yfy,persuasionlaser,1 point,Thu May 7 19:53:44 2015 UTC,"What's the return time of that route? Also creating routes may be hard but is fun and rewarding, as long as you make a good one. Got a video of that route too?"

Tribes,354yfy,Mindflayr,1 point,Fri May 8 04:46:42 2015 UTC,"so a 4 bounce route, compared to a standard b2f any schmoe (me) can run ezmode for the other team?  All I know is everytime i've played Kata Blitz, the 2nd spot on that side always causes issues, and the other team almost always gets to 4 caps while we would spend the entire rest of the map trying to pick that flag up and all the D had to do was sit 3 people on it. Usually the fact that the 5th cap was inside was the only thing that gave our team time to catch up. it often took 10-15 minutes to get that 1 cap, then you could tie it up at 4-4. So if you play without the 5th cap, my guess is that youd have a 60-70% win rate advantage based on that 1 cap position. It was a real bummer as there were 3-4 other great places they could have put the flag, and Kata blitz is v fun other than that 1 spot (and for some ppl cap #5)."
Tribes,354yfy,Flexsintekk,1 point,Fri May 8 16:18:38 2015 UTC,"That's just the way Kata is, BE is better. The point is that you can still normal setups and still find a way to reach the flag spot.  O yea and just have offense toss the flag on stand gg"
Tribes,354yfy,snakke1,1 point,Fri May 8 17:54:22 2015 UTC,I understand the workarounds. I am saying in practice (ive played Kata blitz 20+ times) it always ends up lopsided due to that specific flag for that team.. which is why it is a bad blitz map. I would hate to play it in a pug.

Tribes,355bu2,Will12239,4,Fri May 8 18:33:19 2015 UTC,"Doesn't it help out high ping users more? Since without magic chain their bullets are displayed even more inaccurately?  I use it because without it, ""simulated projectiles off"" bullets are too small to see and move erratically, almost like their location is updated at a much lower fps than the game runs at. 'Simulated projectile on' bullets are too large and shoot out of your eyeball, taking up half the screen."
Tribes,355bu2,wordthompsonian,-3,Fri May 8 19:15:56 2015 UTC,Yea but just the fact that it helps low ping players too kinda makes it exploiting. Low ping players get an unfair advantage and high ping players are more normal
Tribes,355bu2,Zulieu,5,Fri May 8 20:16:09 2015 UTC,"Anyone with sub-30 ping isn't really benefiting, it makes their colt worse. As for chain, sim projectiles on or off to change bullet size, magic chain doesn't give them any more of an edge, esp when it comes to colt"
Tribes,354okv,pard0n99,8,Thu May 7 02:03:34 2015 UTC,"i don't mind 5 caps if we play 3 maps all of the time, but i prefer 7 caps as it takes quite a while to start a pug. However, i did like what soni mentioned previously about there being a mercy rule in which after one team is 4 caps ahead, the other may surrender the map. This is because i assume you are trying to change the cap limit because your goal is to make pugs better for people when a team turns out to be much better than the other in which the losing team just has a horrible time, and you want to shorten their suffering. However, if the the cap limit is so low, it lowers the chance of a comeback if the losing team was possibly just doing something wrong and manage to resolve their issue. So yea i want 7 cap limit and after a 4 cap lead the losing team may have the option to surrender the map to prevent excess rage/salt/tears."
Tribes,354okv,blastman125,3,Thu May 7 06:45:43 2015 UTC,"great analysis. i agree with most of your points, except for maybe lowering the chances of a comeback. non-game-ending-caps are often let go in order to stage a good offensive run or prepare for the next cap, which could be game ending. this is true for any score-limit and is why games often will end at A:A or A:n where A is one less than the score-limit (e.x. 6:6/6:n for 7 score-limit, 4:4/4:n for 5 score-limit).  personally, i think every numerical server setting could use some experimenting, from vehicle prices/health to class restrictions to banned items (and, of course, score limits). you shouldn't vote on something that you've never tried before (multiple times). granted, we have tried 5 cap before, but there was a reason we shifted away from it.  edited for accuracy"
Tribes,354okv,qhp,1 point,Thu May 7 07:03:49 2015 UTC,vehicle prices/health   what's wrong with those?
Tribes,354okv,angrypolak1,1 point,Thu May 7 18:36:02 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would reduce vehicle price to promote more shrike play. Shrikes are the fuckin best, and more of them is always fuckin hype. I would then possibly reduce vehicle health to balance shrike play."
Tribes,354okv,qhp,1 point,Thu May 7 20:16:37 2015 UTC,Gravs are the fuckin best.   Fixed that for ya.
Tribes,354okv,saturntribes,1 point,Fri May 8 18:02:36 2015 UTC,"Sure. I think if Gravs were readily available (cheap), maps like Raindance would see more play."
Tribes,354okv,qhp,1 point,Fri May 8 21:19:18 2015 UTC,they already are fairly cheap like 1200 i think and the shrike is 35k with perks.  So i don't see the problem with prices since u can easily get 3 shrikes a game.  Shrike play is pretty cool even though most matches i remember ppl use it incorrectly by being greedy and not shrike grabbing.  imo vehicles are too op such as having the ability to grab at pretty much any moment and the shrikes strength in cluster plays.
Tribes,354okv,angrypolak1,1 point,Sat May 9 22:44:58 2015 UTC,"I like this solution though it is a little messy in practice, kind of makes it feel like the losing team is rage quitting when in fact they don't wanna play the rest of a bad stacked pug.  But I would support this solution.  There have been many pugs where say, blackwaltz will say, ""this sux, lets switch the map"", and I will agree, but we can't get the rest of the five players on board, or they are indecisive.  This is where this solution gets messy.  The winning team might also get salty because we end the map early and they don't want to have short pugs. So then it is a question of quantity or quality.  Is the quality of the pug more important than how long it is?  Can a long pug where your losing on the scoreboard the entire time still be fun for a capper who is running into a hof for 25 mins straight?  At what point does said capper, Soni, me soon, just leave the game feeling he wasted 25 mins of his life.  And we wonder why all the cappers leave the pugging community."

I reseated the GPU last night and made sure my cable management allowed for good airflow and I didn't even see an improvement in temps. It can't operate at temperatures lower than the room it's in."

Hirez is still very implied in the development of the game, they interact a lot with the community.  Not much more. Have fun ? :)"
Tribes,34uy2z,Gaouchos,2,Mon May 4 20:02:07 2015 UTC,"Now, what did I miss? My perfect timed midair mirv kill on a 250 kmph capper on Katabatic BE right to left route playing with ~16FPS and 110 ping on NAE while diagonally crossing his path.  Is the competetive scene still going, are there many casts? Draft. But I guess, as soon as there is no sponsoring anymore even those drafts will disappear or be scaled down to once in 3 months or less.  Are pugs still played a lot? PUG servers are usually full.  Is Hirez doing anything at all? Yes. They pleasure themselves on the suffer of us remaining and fap over a SMITE ad.  Anything else I should know? The simple fact that Tribes is a fucking great invention (Z-axis) has given us the circumstance that - still - some hundred (thousand?) people play regularly. You should focus now too on Project Z, now officially called ""Midair"", http://www.playmidair.com."
Tribes,34uy2z,Pumpelchce,2,Tue May 5 13:12:42 2015 UTC,"Now, what did I miss? Nothing, we still got tribes  Is the competetive scene still going, are there many casts? No comp scene. Only PUGs. Some people cast the Draft stuff  Are pugs still played a lot? Yes. Every night.  Is Hirez doing anything at all? No. HiRez hates the Tribes community.  Anything else I should know? So you probably do not know this , but Tribes has not received a patch in two years. Since then, a ton of games have come and gone. Tribes:Ascend however, for all it's mistakes HiRez has made, has managed to some how keep a regular community of roughly 300-400 people playing. I'm sure people could chime in on this post and tell us what game communities have died, but as far as I'm aware, Firefall, Titanfall and Evolve have all met their maker way before their time. Some food for thought I guess."

Tribes,34uy2z,Achus619,1 point,Tue May 5 05:29:31 2015 UTC,Apparently a seriously lack of dev response to a bunch of bugs killed the game dead. I know Xanthyr/Hooty is not playing it anymore and was pretty serious about it. They are only pushing the esports thing because they feel like trying to grub ez PR from it.
Tribes,34uy2z,Rynex,2,Tue May 5 07:48:25 2015 UTC,that's so sad :(
Tribes,34uy2z,Achus619,3,Tue May 5 16:02:45 2015 UTC,If you think that's sad look at Toxikk. Dead before it was even breathing.
Tribes,34uy2z,scrambler_jumper,2,Tue May 5 18:07:31 2015 UTC,"Confirmed. Toxikk died on its first update. Strike Vector also died. Also, if you want to laugh harder, Monday Night Combat died within a month and Super Monday Night Combat is also suffering. Both those games have come and gone during T:A's life time. Also Loadout is dead? Also maybe UE4 as it seems a bit thin on players right now but I'm sure there will be more if I check prime time.  There's a lot of dead FPS games actually during the existence of Tribes. T:A can run a couple of full servers for people to join even after the development for it stopped."

Soni played HoF, then ran half a route to get a spot on the capper, and never touched a flag. Lazy's team claimed he was capping, bitched that we ran a quadruple cap against them to trounce them 7-2, and decided that the game wouldn't count anymore. It was lame"

It's common that from capper pov the player isn't warping at all on his own end but for whatever reason as packets reach the server and are sent out to other players there's increased jittering between higher ping players  If this is the case then I don't blame Bloody, he probably assumed people were full of shit when they told him he's warping"

Tribes,34s033,angrypolak1,7,Mon May 4 15:48:59 2015 UTC,"Real talk though, you guys need to chill out with the accusations against eaks to be honest. I played on his team the draft where he sniped, and there was quite a few things that went unspotted, and a lot of the spots on cappers was from O. He got a lot of frags and did a lot of work for sure, but the spotting he did was not really anything out of the ordinary sniper. Good O and cappers can spot much more than a single sniper, I think you're forgetting that. At high level play it's normal that O and cap get the spots more than sniper, so the sniper can focus on dealing damage to enemy O."
Tribes,34s033,nordsmark,6,Mon May 4 16:36:51 2015 UTC,"I dont know for sure if hes toggleboxing, but he can record and imo he should do it most if not all games just to shut everyones mouth. The fact that he only recorded a bit of some maps, coupled with the fact that he suddenly got a lot better at sniping and spotting makes people think he's hacking. Also, how can you know for sure hes not using toggleboxes?"
Tribes,34s033,TheBlackPanda1,3,Mon May 4 18:16:29 2015 UTC,"Of course I don't know it for sure, but from playing on his team it sure didn't feel like it. I mean it's right there in my post, a lot (if not most) spots during that draft was from O/capper.   This community is so fucking quick to accuse everyone from hacking/exploiting just based on what it ""feels like"" to play against a certain person. I mean for fucks sake, people have to prove their innocence here, just from what people think they do. This is not just in the case of Eaks I'm talking, and I think it's fucking pathetic that people are so fast to dismiss someone else 'cus they ""might be cheating"" - without any proof, just your own gut feeling."
Tribes,34s033,nordsmark,1 point,Mon May 4 22:10:03 2015 UTC,"Unless they post vods, you can never know if someone is using it or not. Some people you'd never suspect might be using it and hiding it well, but you're not going to lose any sleep over that and rightly so.  I don't think any one person should have to endeavor to prove the legitimacy of their gameplay indefinitely just because people have suspicions. What can be done is establishing a rule requiring people to post vods, which was done last draft, and from what I can see, there are already some vods up. I honestly don't see what the problem is."
Tribes,34s033,Billyb0i,5,Mon May 4 18:55:16 2015 UTC,"Besides the fact that practically every sniper posted vods except for eaks who makes consistent excuses about not posting the vods.  I believe the eu rule was to have vods posted a week after the draft and he has posted 2 maps, dx and rd.  Which are the easiest maps/require the least amount of spotting by a sniper. There's also the fact that eaks is a spoiled baguette and can have one of the most butthurt personalities at times making him quite the unlikeable person."
Tribes,34s033,angrypolak1,2,Mon May 4 19:11:11 2015 UTC,"Says here that the deadline for posting vods is the 6th of May. If 'practically' every other sniper posted vods, I take it there is someone else who hasn't fully complied. Are they being given the same treatment?  Maybe he is boxing, maybe not. It's going to be up to the draft admins to decide what constitutes sufficient evidence of innocence. But applying different standards to people based on their personality is indefensible.  Edit. Also, it all seems a bit silly considering eaks' team placement in the draft. Didn't he get dropped first?"

Only NA community is paranoid like you are. Europe is thinking or saying but do not persecute me like You Na ppl do ! I'm not gonna record all my PUGS just because you made a prejudice that i was a toggleboxer and WITHOUT proof, it's not like a do all spots and kill all the capper.

I never said he was hitboxing nor do I actually think he is, maybe some people do but i think most of the time it's just them complaining.  Sekae was accused of hitboxing by some people and then he streamed proving his innocence and he also has garbage internet.  It's just a joke because eaks has a grudge against me and tries to taunt me in pugs and calls me a sheet when he has the chance.  It's quite amusing how someone can get that mad at vidoe gaems.  It seems eaks cannot accept losing and wants the most dstacked defense to make pugs bad for the other team.

I mean not showing his vods is kinda stupid at this point, but accusing him without basing it on actual fishy moments is just as stupid."
Tribes,34s033,Schreq,1 point,Mon May 4 21:27:30 2015 UTC,"Neither is there the slightest indication of him toggle boxing besides ""he not show vod, so he cheater""   True, but theres absolutely no way we can tell if someones toggleboxing other than assumptions and seeing vods to be proven right or wrong. And i dont think having people speccing him could be of any more help, considering that it will still only be their opinion, so not 100% right or wrong."
Tribes,34s033,TheBlackPanda1,3,Tue May 5 01:40:14 2015 UTC,"You don't have to be 100% right or wrong. Basing the whole accusations on questionable spots/shots would just be fair, because the method of the current accusations is not."

This right here I certainly didn't think I'd see from you, Panda, as I think you're a pretty intelligent person. But how is it fair in any way, shape or form that people have to proof their innocence because of accusations? There's no proof that he uses them outside of fucking accusations either. I mean fucking hell, you guys accusing eaks of boxing is as much proof against him as random pub players accusing me of aimbotting is proof of me doing so.   The guy actually did post parts of one of his vods, but that's apparently not good enough either 'cus of the map that he picked. It just seems so desperate, like you just really want eaks to be boxing for whatever reason."
Tribes,34s033,nordsmark,3,Tue May 5 12:02:12 2015 UTC,"But how is it fair in any way, shape or form that people have to proof their innocence because of accusations?                It isn't really, not if the accusations were made after the fact, leaving Eaks effectively defenseless. But when the FIRST map ended our capper, Oceansheep, said clearly in chat something like ""I can't wait to see your POV eaks :)"", as we were all under the impression that snipers were recording (and they ALL were, except for Eaks).              Now, he might not have gotten the memo about recording and I wasn't expecting to see VODs from the first map, but he should have at least recorded from then on.              The fact that he didn't and the fact that other teams shared our suspicions about Eaks (I think jack's team went triple capping on Tartarus because of that) made it very shady.         Now, we all know that nothing can be done at this point and I don't think there's anyone sour about that, but it's just silly to dismiss these arguments as unsubstantiated."
Tribes,34s033,eightnine,3,Mon May 4 22:17:32 2015 UTC,"boxes, they kinda aim for u.  Edit: Also I totally agree. The burden of proof is on the accuser. Just because people think eaks became too good to be legit, amplified by how disliked he generally is, doesn't legitimate such a witch hunt on him. Of course he could just show vods to make everybody shut up but will it stop then? Recording every pug so people will stay silent? c'mon...  Didn't he say his upload speed is total garbage? Yes, he posted a montage, but that's only like ~10 minutes, not several 25 minute maps. I guess not being a noob at video encoding would help too but w/e.  At some point we just have to trust people, even people you dislike. It's the only option we have besides having everybody recording everything."
Tribes,34s033,Schreq,2,Tue May 5 05:57:50 2015 UTC,"The recording of every pug was an exageration, but he should have recorded the whole draft like he had to.

There wasn't a rule about it or anything.  If it's regarding the latest draft, I was under the impression there was a clearly defined rule about, in which case a ban from next draft for not following the rules seems like a simple enough thing."

Yet it seems like he doesnt try to do anything against it, even though the last draft providing vods on all maps if sniping was a must.   And its true it does seem a bit desperate. The fact that all he has to do to prove his point and be left alone is just record draft maps, and upload the ones that people had a lot of doubts about is what i dont get.

Tribes,34s033,TheBlackPanda1,1 point,Tue May 5 06:32:39 2015 UTC,"In my unconcerned eyes the main problem is the whole accusation thing based on... What? I agree that if someone gets accused of cheating whatsoever he will have to submit proof to be innocent.  But before we talk about how the proofing progress is going on we should ask ourselves if the accusation ist not either just an excuse, a stereotype we built about eaks in particular or the feeling of actually unfair treatment towards you.  We attribute wrong in this situation, maybe its not eaks who is a cheater and tries to get away from it by refusing to record, but maybe, just maybe he is not aware of why he should have recorded in the first place. He didn't record, but you take it as granted that this is a sign of him cheating instead of just attributing that circumstance to him being damn stupid."
Tribes,34s033,Luuigi,2,Tue May 5 03:59:46 2015 UTC,"In my unconcerned eyes the main problem is the whole accusation thing based on... What?    Its all based on peoples opinion about him hacking or not because theres nothing else we have. Its not straight up aimbotting, making it easier to detect, its more of subtle thing. I cant see any other way of detecting it other than actually seeing a vod of someone using it.   About the stereotype, it most likely has an influence on peoples opinion about eaks, but its not decisive, at least not for me.  And im sure eaks knows he had to record, the admins made it clear last draft, making it a rule for sniping. And theres no concrete signs of him cheating as theres no way of telling he is not. Thats the problem. Without vods no one can say for sure if hes toggleboxing or not."

Tribes,34p008,Dirty_Merkin,11,Sun May 3 05:42:23 2015 UTC,He's using the rage perk. Which means he gets a certain percentage of health back when his flag is picked up.
Tribes,34p008,PowerTattie,9,Sun May 3 10:04:23 2015 UTC,He's using rage :3
Tribes,34p008,zombieofthepast,11,Sun May 3 08:40:46 2015 UTC,"That coincided with a flag grab, I think. Look at the Rage perk.  The other things that can give instant health are ammo pickups, but I didn't see any of those near where he landed."
Tribes,34p008,benburhans,6,Sun May 3 06:42:55 2015 UTC,u should try not playing with default sensitivity and big weapon models
Tribes,34p008,angrypolak1,3,Sun May 3 16:51:20 2015 UTC,"Hmm I did have the weapon models on small at one point, don't remember switching it back.  Oops.    I'm curious what level of sensitivity do you use higher or low :)."
Tribes,34p008,angrypolak1,5,Mon May 4 01:55:28 2015 UTC,the default is at 30 and mine is around 6.  You don't need to go that low but it depends on how much mouse space you have and just what feels comfortable for you.  It will probably be awkward at first but you shouldn't be able to make multiple 360s in game by moving your mouse an inch.
Tribes,34p008,qhp,3,Mon May 4 02:24:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I'll give it a shot."
Tribes,34p008,Obyeag,2,Mon May 4 02:53:24 2015 UTC,One of the most common DPI/Sens combo is 400/10 or 800/5. You can start there and adjust accordingly.
Tribes,34p008,Obyeag,3,Wed May 6 01:00:05 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info everyone.  I've never really spent any time learning all the perks.  I knew it was some pack/perk but I didn't know which one.  I got comfortable with my perks and never really tried the others :)

Why settle on 5?   Because it used to be the standard.   So? 7 is the standard now, and you want to change the standard. You should vote as for whether the capout should be reduced or not, and then experiment with new cap/time settings."
Tribes,34les5,qhp,3,Sat May 2 05:22:06 2015 UTC,"The idea was that reducing the cap limit would make stacked matches shorter and leave close matches virtually unchanged. I wanted to try 6 and see what that would be like, but that didn't fly. I think below/around 5 you feel incentive to d-stack since each cap is that important.  The other thing we want to adjust is the time limit. Maybe a shorter time limit by 2-4 minutes would give incentive to play more offensively."
Tribes,34les5,Soninova,2,Sat May 2 05:26:12 2015 UTC,"I think below/around 5 you feel incentive to d-stack since each cap is that important.

Ending stacked pugs quicker makes sense, but I feel like if you set the cap score too low, you risk shortening games that have lots of flag movement.  Were that we were free from the shackles of HiRez, what would be awesome would be to have like a 5-cap limit, but make it so that in order to insta-end the game, you had to be ahead by 2 caps (outside of overtime / 'golden cap')."

He doesn't waste a single beat and he uses different effects and clips for different parts of the song: at 1:15 he speeds up the clip as the music speeds up, at 1:32 there's a screenshake as the song goes a bit shaky and right after that he once again speeds up the clip as the song speeds up, at 2:10 the song repeats the same part three times, so he puts 3 similar clips one after the other, and when the song goes back on track so does the rest of the clips. these are all factors you've got to consider when you are making a montage. keep practicing, keep getting better"

Tribes,34c1ke,qhp,2,Wed Apr 29 23:18:03 2015 UTC,Wasn't this during the NASL tournament as well?  I recall Fire being...displeased by the LAR change.
Tribes,34c1ke,evanvolm,5,Wed Apr 29 23:26:46 2015 UTC,"Unsure, but I wouldn't put it past HiRez to push updates in the middle of the largest tournament T:A had ever seen (at that time). LAR was basically useless this patch, and most chasers were forced to use the shotgun. So slow, so bad.  For anyone who doesn't know, the LAR used to be burst fire for each click. Meaning every time you clicked, you fired 3 bullets and only 3 bullets. Since the only people using LAR were chasers and having to click over and over again to fire all your rounds thoroughly fucks with your aim (not to mention the LAR has the 3rd worst spread in the game, its already inaccurate), the weapon needed a change. The buff, which everyone was asking for, was to make it hold-to-fire, so you wouldn't have to spam click to fire all your bursts. In enabling hold-to-fire, they somehow lowered the fire-rate to the lowest shit ever, making the weapon useless. Finally, the solution was just buff the rate entirely, and now we have the current LAR (which is significantly faster and stronger than the original, even with a macro)."
Tribes,34c1ke,qhp,-4,Wed Apr 29 23:32:32 2015 UTC,LAR was better like that. Pth didn't need an auto. And they kept the burst fire which was just weird.
Tribes,34c1ke,Will12239,6,Thu Apr 30 01:32:59 2015 UTC,PTH definitely needs an auto in this game where explosives are almost entirely ineffective for chasing.
Tribes,34c1ke,qhp,-5,Thu Apr 30 01:44:01 2015 UTC,Auto is barely any different than how it was. It just used to require a little more precision which helped differentiate it.
Tribes,34c1ke,Will12239,6,Thu Apr 30 01:46:09 2015 UTC,"It still requires precision. It's not a bullet hose, especially since it bursts. You can't possibly think that PTH chasing is strong with the improved LAR?"
Tribes,34c1ke,qhp,-4,Thu Apr 30 01:47:57 2015 UTC,It's just barely better. I didn't see any need for the change to make it auto especially since it was kind of unique.

Whenever they start to REALLY malfunction at lot I set them to 500 hz, run through all the dpi levels, set them back to 1000 hz, run through all the dpi levels and that seems to clear it for a while.

Tribes,348b4u,Will12239,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:24:07 2015 UTC,"Just remember that if you got 60ish ping, the actual damage will be applied a little after you see the claw swing in front of you. The whole skill is mastering this lag"
Tribes,348b4u,Auzymelts,1 point,Wed Apr 29 12:34:37 2015 UTC,"60 is really okay. Honestly. When you play at 120+... That's getting tougher. For eg, you move at the same pace (or maybe a bit quicker) behind someone, you won't even be able to melee him. Even if you are really close to him, these 0.12seconds are too long to get the melee to hit."
Tribes,348b4u,Will12239,2,Wed Apr 29 12:45:31 2015 UTC,"tbh, if my ping was consistently over 90, I would stop playing this"

Tribes,348b4u,scrambler_jumper,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:44:06 2015 UTC,"Best way to practice is on incoming cappers. General rule: always melee a 1/2 second early and just in front of where you want it to actually land. Although this will vary depending on your ping.   The melee mechanic is very wonky in this game in general, I can't even count how many seemingly perfect melees I had on a moving capper, except that instead of a melee I would just bounce off the capper in the opposite direction."

Tribes,345h0w,ArmoredPenguin94,8,Tue Apr 28 13:33:33 2015 UTC,I think it might be a good idea to wait at least a month or so before the next draft. People could just be burned out and these next weeks are incredible busy for most students. Also instead of the time when games start it would be nice to have the check in deadline since games pretty much never start on time but the deadline for check in is always exact. Thanks!
Tribes,345h0w,Wengatang69,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:32:53 2015 UTC,"For the check in thing: sure, we can do that.   For the wait: Oh I absolutely agree, these dates are all right before or in the middle of my exams crunchtime. Hence why I put many of the mid/late June weekends in.   But its not my choice, if people want to have drafts earlier than that then so be it."

Then you'd guarantee more midairs from even the noobiest player and they won't be so frustrated. Also, if the course correction was limited but constant you could see things like a disc shooting too far to the right of a player, curving left, and continuing to curve around the player, perhaps shooting off to the left at a 90 degree angle from the shooter. Imagine it like as if it entered the gravitational field of a player, did a partial orbit, and then fell out. Eh, just an idea."

Tribes,341l11,jamiemccomb,1 point,Fri May 1 20:25:40 2015 UTC,"I want the games I play to retain their playerbase. The steep tribes skill curve chases new players away (among other things: cheaters, trolls, griefers, etc.). Besides, they're calling it Midair, so why not? I used to play Tron 2.0 multiplayer with manual disc guidance after it left your hand (you control it with your mouse) and that was still incredibly fun and challenging. Also you could block with the disc if you were still holding. It was great.  I'm not saying rocket launcher level of lock on and guidance, just a slight punishment if the enemy is generating heat - shooting or jetting."

I feel like the PTH/SLD Projectiles Only Arena battles I've had have been pretty damn competitive, but maybe that's baby stuff for your neuronal disorder that isn't satisfied by anything less than a rat tat tat hit point drain per second. It's just different playing styles, man.  When I went to PUGs it was full of dismissive condescending little bastards who sigh heavily at everything everyone else does because think they are better and know better. Does that sound familiar? None of that for me, thank you. I'd rather find people that laugh and have fun and have respect for each other and are willing to limit themselves in order to correct the money-grabbing sins of the developer that turned this franchise into a boring gun fight.  When I tried Magic the gathering (waaay back in the day) I had fun for a bit and then my friends started spending a lot of money and getting crazy competitive and angry, so I dropped it. I used to enjoy getting together to play Texas Hold'em and the same thing happened -- they started playing with real money, then higher and higher stakes, and the drama began. And then I walked away. It's not the competition, it's the drama I don't want, and you red-facers are full of drama.  You see how calm I am in the face of your fury? Yes, I am sort of a troll - at least, I was stirring you up a bit - but this calm is what I had to find in order to find out how to disc. That's what's beautiful about it, it's like zen. When I used to play unreal tournament I'd play exclusively InstaGib - 1 hit, 1 kill with a precision laserbeam thing. It was maddeningly frustrating, especially for the kind of netcode and pings we had back then. I'm sure I beat myself up too much for stuff that wasn't my fault. I really wanted to be the best. I was high strung like you. And now I'm 41, and I don't give a rat's patoot about nothing, and if I lose, so what? I remain calm as the discs are flying about me, I raise my fusor and take aim, calculate the lag and the falling rate and the 50% inheritance all in the flick of an eye, and then fire. Nothing could be sweeter. I'm sorry you don't understand.  p.s. I don't have a ""list"" or know what that means (ban list?) and I don't downvote for people having opinions."
Tribes,341l11,Gierling,1 point,Sat May 2 02:19:06 2015 UTC,"Then you admit that what you want from the game is not indicative of good competitive gameplay. The drama is always going to be a consequence of that, as with any sport. You realise you aren't interested in competition and therefore I don't understand your argument at all. TA was a competitive game. It was even marketed that way. I am astonished I bothered continuing this argument after you used the term 'aspergers' to be honest.

GG hirez...  joining private servers is really your only hope if there are assholes in the novice servers.  As for the second, the tech SMG is one of the most powerful weapons in the game. Hitting every bullet is not unreasonable, especially against people in stonehenge, who tend not to be all that great at movement. 100 kills is a lot, but definitely feasible without hacking. Also, hacking tends not to work very well with autos because the projectiles screw things up. So no, they were probably not hacking."

Tribes,33xq9s,freefoodd,2,Sun Apr 26 18:13:32 2015 UTC,Yea the strobing thing is a nice idea but in reality it doesn't improve things very much from 144hz and mostly serves to just dim your monitor.
Tribes,33xq9s,QuiteKid,3,Sun Apr 26 22:30:04 2015 UTC,The only sort of person I could imagine saying something like that would be someone who hasn't done side by side comparisons. The differenced in motion clarity is huge for me.
Tribes,33xq9s,sh4z,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:35:32 2015 UTC,"Well I only have one 144hz monitor, so I cant do a side by side, but I spend enough time on it to know that the benefit of ""motion clarity"" did not out weigh the hit to brightness. Which monitor do you have?"
Tribes,33xq9s,QuiteKid,3,Sun Apr 26 22:42:41 2015 UTC,VG278HE. Set up lightboost and run blurbuster tests with and without it enabled. Brightness isn't an issue if the monitor is set up right to begin with. Strobing is very popular and not without reason. Can your computer push enough frames to benefit from it? If you aren't getting 120+ fps this is all moot.
Tribes,33xq9s,lllllllolyolo,2,Sun Apr 26 22:56:45 2015 UTC,"But who gives a shit about ""blurry-ness"" in tribes? The only reason more hz is better for tribes (imo) is the responsiveness off the game. Going from 60 to 120 removes so much mouse input delay. Not sure about 120 to 144 tho."

Tribes,33xq9s,s1non,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:09:02 2015 UTC,"Its not something that will instantly make you best player in the world, how big your aiming improvement will be will depend on your hand-eye coordination and to what extent you can utilize it. Friend of mine tried to play quakelive on 200 and 160hz @ my place, his usual scrub 33% lg from 60hz lcd improved to mere 36-37 which is almost nothing, both have same mice and just slightly different cloth pads (he had qck i gave him goliathus speed). Maybe problem is not in monitor but you being unable to capitalize on this advantage, focus more on shots timing if thats hitscan weapon, or, well, do something to your chain (change provider in hopes to reduce ping lol, chaining in tribes is a joke on low pings). You cant track your accuracy percentages in tribes anyway so how do you measure your aim in here lol, it might not be the aim thats a problem but your poor positioning on the map that makes you lose duels, in tribes positioning is actually like 60% of win in duel, not aim."
Tribes,33xq9s,Dodgesabre,-1,Tue Apr 28 17:22:45 2015 UTC,"Very true. And, great advice.   Yeah, a friend of mine (ign:implausability), told me that I should shut off my reticle and chain like that for a while. And, he's right. I am already getting my aim back.   A few other old friends on here have given pointers as well.   But your right. Positioning is key. Movement, energy management. That's my weakest point I would say right now.   But I'm getting it back. Already feeling smoother whilst skiing, also dueling is getting back on point.   Thanks for the advice.   See you in the Wilderzone my friend.   :)"
Tribes,33xq9s,gst800,-1,Sun Apr 26 23:23:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah view at it like that - you have good starting conditions, good devices to play on so now whats left is to improve on actual game aspects. I never bothered training chain because i hit my own limit long ago and couldnt go past it because of 50-60 ping, so i personally focused more on hitscan and was pleased with results. I would honestly say if your ping is above 28 dont bother much with training chain since youll always be at disadvatage vs 8-16 pingers with projectile autos if you just go for exchanges, outplay enemies by positioning and smart nade spam/groundpounds. If you look at sld duels its all about nade spam and groundpound, its not like 1v1 lg duel in quake."
Tribes,33xq9s,s1non,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:54:54 2015 UTC,"There's 0 people in my region with sub 0-16 ping who can chain better then some of us with 40 ping.  There is a large misconception imo with chain and ping, I don't mean to offend but I don't believe you hit your limit. I've been 1 clipped by a 120 ping SLD for instance more times then I can count on my hands. Especially with the game in it's current state you aren't going to be ineffective with chain at higher pings. No region has a team of god tier chainers that all have 16 ping most people with that ping rely on their chain and have many other faults anyway."
Tribes,33xq9s,s1non,-1,Mon Apr 27 09:16:57 2015 UTC,"EU has best chainers in this game with lowest pings possible, majority of them has 20 and below ping, there are people with legit 0-8 pings in here which i never seen in usa or aus. It is physically impossible to outchain somebody who cant miss a single bullet and with 50 / 60 ping its really tough to do so. Plus i didnt care much about wasting time training projectile chaining and wouldnt bother even if i would have 30 and below, its a skill worthless in any other game as only tribes series has projectile chaining, for the same reason you almost never will meet anyone from top comp tribes anywhere near close to competetive levels in other games, i know like 4 comp tribes players who are actually good in other shooters, rest cant switch to other shooters and play on the same level because no groundpound, no projectile autos, and there is an actual adad which is not present in tribes. If you plan to play tribes ascend forever (lul) with all 3 people thats left in there, go for it. Im abit more realistic and even back when i played i sticked with hitscan almost exclusively."
Tribes,33xq9s,gst800,2,Mon Apr 27 11:06:50 2015 UTC,"Being realistic and giving up aren't the same things. Just because you chose to limit yourself doesn't mean that others need to and definitely doesn't mean it's advice you should pass out. EVO is from NAW as well so that advice doesn't apply to his region.   Please link me a video of someone who doesn't miss chain, I'd love to see that :D"

Tribes,33uzmy,hobowithabazooka,18,Sat Apr 25 22:04:42 2015 UTC,"play a different class. Odds are in a pub game, there will be 5+ other players dealing with the gen already. It's where we all started, and there are plenty who never left. Learn how to chase or HoF if you still want to play defense. Learn how to cap so you can go fast. Play offense so you can actually see the prettiness of the maps."
Tribes,33uzmy,fl1po,6,Sat Apr 25 22:17:45 2015 UTC,"Tech can be used as an offensive class with thumper and some shotgun, for example."
Tribes,33uzmy,DarcseeD,-1,Sat Apr 25 22:10:36 2015 UTC,"When things are fine and dandy our end I go on the offensive quite effectively, the thumper is solid, and the repair tool is great for knocking out turrets with the right perk"
Tribes,33uzmy,sund3r,2,Sun Apr 26 00:28:43 2015 UTC,"If you're insistent on playing the Tech even when you go on offence, consider switching to a loadout that has the Sawed-Off Shotgun instead of the repair tool. Switching the thumper for the TCN4 is also probably a good idea, unless you can't chain at all (in which case you should practice). And of course the belt item should be the TCNG grenade, or Quickfuse if you want something more overpowered.  Your goal should not be to fight enemy turrets, if you want to do that, you'll be far more effective with the JUG class. Instead the Tech can be a very formidable duelling class, especially if you use the TCN4. If you want to use the thumper tho, it too works quite well in combination with the Shotgun. Use the thumper to force the enemy into the air and once they make themselves an easy target by floating in the air, switch to the shotgun and blast them out of the sky. Switch back to your primary weapon after the passive reload and rinse and repeat. The Quick Draw perk is a must.  Throw your grenades to help clear the enemy flag stand and use your turret as a defensive tool. If you're low HP, try to get behind a crest of a hill or break the enemies' line of sight some other way and then plant the turret where they can't see it from afar. You will get a lot of hate for this if you do it well, since it is a cheap tactic.  So basically the ideal loadout for TCN offence would be:   Primary - TCN4 (or Thumper) Secondary - Sawed-off Shotgun Pack - Light Turret Belt - TCNG (or Quickfuse) 1st perk - Looter 2nd perk - Quick Draw"

Tribes,33uzmy,DarcseeD,0,Sat Apr 25 23:37:06 2015 UTC,"Lots of people saying this but I'm not sure how keeping the gen, turrets and radar going is useless? Especially the gen which powers everything else."
Tribes,33uzmy,krokooc,7,Sun Apr 26 00:22:43 2015 UTC,"Just a playstyle, I know personally I get upset when someone I'm fighting is 1 health and some tech repairs a mk. 4 base turret that shoots me in the face. Every offense has to worry about the inevitable 3 LD's in a pub, probably a snipe or two, and then turrets shooting their feet every 1.5 seconds. Not to mention doombringer HoF's that lay 2 forcefields and 3 mines every time they get set up on stand, pinkmisting the capper every run. Then comes the people getting upset, d-stacking, and 35 minute blueshift games"
Tribes,33uzmy,krokooc,6,Sun Apr 26 00:36:53 2015 UTC,"It's not useless per se, but doing anything else is almost always more useful.  If you're focused on keeping the gen alive and a few other techs are running from turret to turret trying to keep them up, that's 2-3 players that could instead be helping clear the enemy flag stand or trying to cap the flag.  Secondly, pub games are almost always D-stacked. It's undersandable why players gravitate towards it - D is just easier to play. Adding turrets into the mix just makes playing O even less desirable. It's not that turrets are hard to take out or avoid, it's simply not fun and the they also slow the game down.  Basically, similarly to how INF's are annoying for you, tech's are a nuisence for those who play offence. You're making the game less fun for other players, since you're forcing them to fight static defences instead of actual live players."
Tribes,33uzmy,gammaTHETA,4,Sun Apr 26 11:02:54 2015 UTC,"there will always be someone to repair the damn gen/turrets/radar... Always. Easy work for easy point will always bring someone to this role.   It sucks to have to fight throught MK4, trying to avoid their projectiles. I don't say it's hard. It sucks. Its not fun, will never be, and all you gain by repairing the turrets it killing the game. there will be no grab, no fights on flag stand, yay.  But, there is never enough guys in Offense, to retrieve the flag, destroy the turrets (dont go to gen). Why, because people repair the gen and no one wants to fight against stupid turrets. Or try giving up the gen, and learn to fight with the tcn. It's hard to deal with if you play well.  Hurray for pubs game destroyed by techs. Go Offense, learn to cap, but stop repairing, please."
Tribes,33uzmy,Theheartattack,3,Sun Apr 26 10:28:12 2015 UTC,"I never really thought about it like that. I do play offence quite often if there's already a tech about, I'll either go brute and disrupt their defense or pathfinder for the flag capping. I've never really enjoyed it quite so much as tech though, I guess the feeling of accomplishment is more tangible when you see people's belt items in action and things like turrets helping the team.   I've got quite a lot of progression on pathfinder so perhaps I'll force myself to do that for a while and hopefully I'll start enjoying it more!"

Tribes,33uzmy,beerrun1,1 point,Sun Apr 26 10:37:41 2015 UTC,"if i recall correctly Tech has a type of proximity mine that doesn't do much damage, but does enough to temporarily reveal Infs. I used them a lot if there was an especially good Inf but on pubs i rarely ever get outgunned by them. They work well in small gen rooms, but if you use your head you can use them in any size room."

Tribes,33uzmy,Voidspawnie,4,Sat Apr 25 23:03:13 2015 UTC,"Playing against INF's is annoying, because the ability for players to go invisible in an FPS game is absolutely fucking dumb. A good INF can always choose when to engage and if they're using smoke grenades, they can also often disengage if the encounter isn't going their way.  Sure, you could spend time learning how to better counter INF's, but I feel that time would be better spent on learning to play other roles than a gen tech. Believe me, once you put your big boy pants on a learn a few more roles, you'll enjoy the game much more due to the added variety. Is your team lacking on offence? Switch to RDR or JUG and go help clear the stand. Is your flag defence scarce? Go out there, spot enemy cappers and help kill the offence. Nobody capping? Learn a couple of simple routes for each map and have at it!  If all the time you spend trying to fight INF's in the gen room would be spent on literally anything else, you'd likely be more useful to your team. Those INF players will keep wasting their time in the gen room, while you're out on the map actually contributing.  But I get it, it's tempting to hide in the gen. The better players usually don't venture there, you don't really need to learn how to ski or chain well, you have cover, static defences and team mates to hide behind, etc. But if you never stick your neck out, you'll forever be fighting for supremacy against players who hunt newbies in gen rooms."

That said, first thing: turn off the music, turn up your sound. Those bastards make footsteps that you can hear. You'll be able to pick up on the pitter-patter of their tiny feet before they get in range for a melee. Second, don't stand still when you're repairing, or better yet, use repair kits to fix the gen. Then you can be moving around the room getting ready for the next assault. Sentry turrets are great against them because if it picks up on them once and starts shooting them they can't cloak.  Motion sening mines work well because it kills their energy pool so they can't cloak right away. Lastly, like everybody else, they make visible footprints at the bottom of gen-room shafts like in bella omega, or in the snow of Kata. If you see a little puff of dirt, or a nugget inexplicably disappear,  that's one of those bastards. Shoot it! Worst case scenario it's nothing. Throwing knives are typically used outdoors more, but that said, once you engage in combat with an inf, don't miss, or they'll disappear on you again and then you have to play a game of battleship in the gen room and hope you get lucky with your thumper."

It's nice to have your generator up, sure, but it's not good if you spend all your time in there defending it. If one infiltrator is drawing several people into the gen room to defend it, he's doing a great job on offense by keeping defenders occupied with something other than the flag. The general goal of an INF is to be as annoying and damaging to defenses as possible in an effort to draw defenders away from the flag, making it easier to cap."

Tribes,33uzmy,mukhtar123456789,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:44:51 2015 UTC,"Tribes CTF is a fluid and adaptive game. Dealing with a more skilled player or numerous players attempting to camp the gens can be frustrating for sure, and INF or INFs especially so due to cloaking and sneak attacks. Adjust, and get to know player names, you will find some players play the same role, like gen camping, or capping, or flag D. At least then you have an idea of what to expect.  Some thoughts in the gen room:  Check the roster, if you see INF's on the other team assume they are in the gen room. Make a quick pass through the gens area and listen for following footsteps and randomly fire behind you. Assume they are waiting near Inv's and for sure near the gens (esp if they are down) hoping you will stop to repair them. Fire weapons randomly in areas you would hide yourself. Also take care of any and all threats before repairing, the longer gens are down the more friendlies will naturally come to help or check what's going on down there. When you do repair don't stay still, again assume they are there and waiting for an opportunity, quite often they will trow a sticky and it will miss you and hit the gens and they are now visible and vulnerable.  If you are defending, play aggressively, get in their face, worst case is you respawn nearby and can get back in there to finish what was started...when you close distance they have less time to adjust their aim accordingly, while you are prepared for this move, and consider if you die the splash damage of their weapon will often damage or kill them outright.  If you still find the fight difficult change to heavy, brute is great if you like an aggressive tactic mentioned above otherwise go Jugg and mortar from more of a distance and if they attack you drop mortars where you are as you move away and let them follow into the mortar, this works with gladiator too.  Also always assume if you do kill a gen camper, they will be back. Many players are very predictable, they become more determined to genhate and will return like clockwork, get ready for them. Get turrets in places they may not turn on cloak yet or in tandem near gens so they need to take out the turrets before killing gens. Then pay attention to your indicators, if you lose your turrets you know someone is going for your gens. I often use turrets and repair kits as I used to use motion sensors.  Another tactic is to simply do something else and let them get bored in there. Go get their gens, I can't tell you how many times I've fought like crazy for my gens, against what seemed like half their team then changed and went after their gens where there was no defense whatsoever or better yet get more involved with the flag. I personally was late to the fun of Shrike CTF, but in a shrike you can play general O and D, chase, clear, as well as protect your capper, be a capper and egrab! You can do a lot and really focus on the whole of the CTF game like no other position. I am to the point that I have a loadout where I carry only the thumper and repair kits and repair gun. I pilot first and fight second. But that is my style, and geared by what I find the most fun...I like to fly!"

Sorry, I'm having too much fun playing inf for exactly the reason you made this post: It pisses people off! :D  Also, infs are hilariously inefficient at doing what you think they're supposed to do. Upgraded base structures simply become too tanky for an inf to deal with. You're nearly always better off attacking structures with a jug or brute, making it completely silly to use an inf for that purpose. There's no real purpose for the class anymore.  If you want to piss infs off, become good with Raider. It's pretty difficult to deal with that shield pack. We can't just attack when you're low, since you'll still have the shield pack for basically extra temporary hp."

Tribes,33ttcj,Schreq,6,Sat Apr 25 19:32:46 2015 UTC,Using whole numbers is pointless with fovscaling on.
Tribes,33v3yb,Auzymelts,2,Sat Apr 25 22:35:01 2015 UTC,Perhaps some node alongside the path between your PC and their servers is causing an increase in ping. I hear that that WTFast program reroutes across the best route.
Tribes,33v3yb,Netsky200n,2,Sat Apr 25 22:37:40 2015 UTC,Yeah I forgot to precise I did try WTFast but no change in my ping... Thanks :)
Tribes,33v3yb,TheBlackPanda1,1 point,Sat Apr 25 22:49:42 2015 UTC,Have you set the server to NL or closer to your location? I had best results setting it to where the game servers are (AMS in this case) rather than where I live.
Tribes,33v3yb,UTF64,-2,Sun Apr 26 12:18:19 2015 UTC,NL? Sorry I don't get what you mean.

Tribes,33v3yb,UTF64,1 point,Sun Apr 26 14:46:18 2015 UTC,Yeah I got that but I was asking what he means. I'm on the AMS servers and I still have a high ping.
Tribes,33v3yb,DigitalBoy760,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:03:00 2015 UTC,"Was talking about WTFast. No matter what country you're from, set the WTFast server to one of the Netherland ones. Maybe that helps."

The inability to mod the game splits the community imho because we're forced to play that one tribes we got and different ideas how tribes should be played and stuff clash, e.g. honorfags on the one side and chainwhores on the other.

Tribes,338gk6,dahlesreb,2,Tue Apr 21 01:52:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link fix. I'm confused though. Is Tribes one the same thing as Starsiege Tribes?  Also, the link I posted can get you a download for Tribes 1.11, but this afterhope patch specifically says it won't work with 1.11, only 1.40.  Soooooo... is the link to Starsiege Tribes in the sidebar the thing I want?  Edit: I got it. The link in the sidebar got something that works properly. I was able to connect to a server and actually shoot stuff. Cool! Singleplayer crashes the game though... Guess I've still got some stuff to figure out."
Tribes,338gk6,DireDrop,2,Tue Apr 21 06:53:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Starsiege: Tribes is Tribes 1. They didn't call the first game Tribes 1 since they didn't know it would be a franchise yet, heheh.  And 1.40 is an updated version of Tribes; some company got their hands on the source code and updated it to work better on modern systems, I believe, and I think AfterHope patches things to prevent some forms of cheating. Some servers will auto-kick you if you try to connect with earlier versions. Were you able to find a working link to 1.40 or just 1.11?  Here's a download link, here's the forum post about it."

Tribes,338gk6,mymanonaplane,4,Mon Apr 20 16:41:50 2015 UTC,"I'd motion for regular tutoring hours. Like Sunday from 3-5pm, depending on who is free, you can jump into mumble and talk to someone about what you're having problems with and get feedback. Also updating the General Guide for New Players with vods from workshops. BM is a tradition we are probably going to have to give up soon. Its hard enough to pick up the game and play with sharks, you're likely to uninstall faster if the shark keeps eating you and shitting on your corpse."
Tribes,338gk6,THEM0RNlNGW00D,2,Mon Apr 20 15:23:05 2015 UTC,"I can update General guide for New Players, just give me the vods that you want there. And if you have something else you want to be added / changed tell me."
Tribes,338gk6,vejket,2,Mon Apr 20 15:46:20 2015 UTC,"Training hours and VODs ist a great idea. The game is - after all - more complex than most others (or: all others) due to the speed and the third axis (jetpack).  But I believe that any tutorial outside of the game will not succeed due to the fact that most players - and 'surviving' means to build a big playerbase with many people - are not willing to spend time for learning.  I believe, the best way to teach people is if some trainings maps with AI enemies have to be played and right there - in the game, on that very map, depending where the player is, lay-over graphs are being shown and a voice says:  Press A (= the configured ski button), follow this red arrow while skiing, now - shot behind you in the ground and turn front again, etc.  Best Case: Game is downloaded, new player goes throught two, three maps like this, then is thrown into the normal map rotation. No website to read, no clip to watch... they're just supplement."

Tribes,3356q8,manbra,6,Sun Apr 19 22:49:51 2015 UTC,Kingston hyper x cloud would be my suggestion.
Tribes,3356q8,xLuftwaffel,2,Sun Apr 19 20:19:14 2015 UTC,"+1 for the Cloud, really nice sound quality and very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.  Mic quality is pretty good, but you can always just buy a modmic if you want better sound quality."
Tribes,3356q8,zombieofthepast,1 point,Sun Apr 19 20:39:09 2015 UTC,"Agree w/ zombieofthepast, HyperX Cloud is super comfortable, simple, great sound quality. I unfortunately got a dud of a mic (bzzzzzzzzzz sound all the time, perhaps a loose wire), but I'm happy with everything else."
Tribes,3356q8,GWej,1 point,Sun Apr 19 22:22:56 2015 UTC,Gotta agree here the hyper x headset is very well reviewed and from what I've read the best at that price point.
Tribes,3356q8,T1LuiGi,4,Mon Apr 20 02:13:06 2015 UTC,"Go to /r/headphones, get a $90 pair of headphones there, and find a $10 mic from wherever."
Tribes,3356q8,hobowithabazooka,4,Sun Apr 19 17:39:29 2015 UTC,"A lot of the microphones bundled with headsets are shit so if that's something you're actually concerned about then I would suggest a desktop mic. In fact, even if you don't care about your voice so much you still might want to get a desktop mic so you can afford actually decent headphones or IEMs"
Tribes,3356q8,persuasionlaser,3,Sun Apr 19 17:54:52 2015 UTC,"If you really want a headset instead of headphones + mic, take a look at the Sennheiser 360. Good-quality mic, good-quality open headphones. Doesn't get better than this without going the separate route."
Tribes,3356q8,pineconez,3,Sun Apr 19 17:44:16 2015 UTC,"+1 for Sennheiser.  These guys make headsets for aviation/military/other ultra high importance jobs, they know their shit and do not fuck around.  I don't own any headsets from them, but I own 2 sets of cans and they're both as close as you can get to audiophile quality without dumping $1000 on a set of cans and another $1000 on a decent amp."

Tribes,3356q8,D1eze,2,Mon Apr 20 16:18:52 2015 UTC,"I got these babies for science because price was about the same as AKG K240 velour pads. Sound quality is just hideous, but somewhat better than in default earbuds.  On topic/to OP: I wouldn't touch gaming headsets like SS Siberia because those are overrated, bass boosted, overpriced products to put it nicely. If it's related to gaming, skip it. With that budget I would target to $100 AKG/KRK/Sennheiser headphones and you can't go terribly wrong. Use your old headset/webcam as a mic. If possible, go test what headphones sounds and feels good for you in some store."
Tribes,3356q8,DrLota,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:08:22 2015 UTC,Buy a pair of used Sennheiser HD555s or equivalent  and then whatever cheap 10$ desktop/snap-on mic  better than any headset you could get for the same cash

So if your monitor is already in that ratio you can just record it straight off. However, since I want better frames I downscale the recording to 720p or 1280x720. This way I know I'm getting the best 720p quality and the most frames. I'm probably going to make a tutorial going over OBS settings soon since a couple of people have asked me to"

I use a Coolermaster keyboard with Cherry reds, a Zowie EC1 Evo white, and an Artisan Hien of some type.  If you ever come visit St. Louis you can use one of two spare computers:  A Phenom X6 with 8 GB and a 5870 or a FX-8350 with 16 GB and a 7970.  If you ask nicely you could probably use the Wife's computer which is another i5-3570K with a GTX 660 Ti.  There's also a guest bedroom down there and a BEagle that would love to be your friend."

Tribes,32v151,CheesyCharlies,2,Thu Apr 16 23:56:06 2015 UTC,"you clearly didn't read all of it then or just have low reading comprehension  if people enjoy a t:a or t2 style game then i hope they enjoy it and play it i said that in the thread and since forever  please realize i was a mod player before t1 base and i am fine with the various ways people can enjoy a tribes game. matin came from a tribes 1 mod and people consistently vote him as a top t:a player especially because t:a plays more like that mod (t1 ren) then it does base. and that's fine.  personally its not for me but who gives a fuck video games are about having fun but that wasn't what that thread was about or my comment in this thread  that thread was mostly about the possibility of hirez suing archetype studios as a likely tactic to shut down development or commercialization of a game that will encroach on their profitable unique niche market  it wouldnt matter if they won or lost the law suit the thread was more of a risk analysis of putting a tiny company like archetype studios in court and if hirez will have grounds to sue or would be caught paying court costs for archetype  as most of these types of claims are settled out of court without court costs being transferred to the opposing party even if the settlement was in favor of archetype games or not the fact that they don't have the money for court costs at that level most likely means hirez has a high probability of using a court case as a way to stifle or completely shut down that game  project z is the first tribes knock off to attempt to commercialize itself which sets it apart from things like legions, or legends, or the hundred other crap projects bugs pray tried to make over the last decade and that makes the situation particularly interesting to me  especially with todd harris being on record as saying he doesn't want to sell the tribes IP and the track record hirez has with protecting and promoting their games  this will probably be my last post on this matter as fixious works for the project z team and is very sensitive to any critical information of the game he's working on and just censors or deletes these types of comments"
Tribes,32v151,TribalWanker,1 point,Fri Apr 17 07:40:18 2015 UTC,jfc half of that thread is just u being bitter that prj z team is not recreating t1  anyway i see ur concern but surely they wouldve anticipated something like that?
Tribes,32v151,CheesyCharlies,2,Fri Apr 17 08:06:06 2015 UTC,"the people behind project z have also been behind numerous tribes knock off failures of the past such as Ascension in 2004, legends in 2003, and renworks which was 04-08 or something  bugs pray the owner of archetype studios especially  they are counting on the fact that hirez won't sue not that it can't be done  IP/copyright law and patents are such a cluster fuck of interpretation especially in video games where you're getting judged on analogy to the music or book industry by 60-70 year olds who have never played a video game in their life it really can go any way  it's clear you didn't read the thread entirely as many examples are all laid out there with a bunch of websites detailing various major claims by companies of copy right infringement dealing with video games  to put this another way one lawyer could say there is no claim and another could say there is it's purely subjective and its not who would win the claim that matters it's that court is expensive and a cheap and effective way for a scummy company like hirez to bleed out a small company like archetype studios that has little money because they'd have to pay for expensive court costs and lawyers fees vs corporate lawyers that hirez could afford  these things are not black and white or perfectly accounted for if they were you would never see video game companies go to court against each other"
Tribes,32v151,TribalWanker,0,Fri Apr 17 08:41:40 2015 UTC,"ya dunno if all ur saying is true but even if it was, what is ur point exactly? should we just give up on the genre entirely? or are u saying its only possible to make a commercial tribe game if ur a big company? tbh i dont think its good to jerk ppl off based on pics of cg model, but i dont see how ur constant bitching is helping the situation"
Tribes,32v151,CheesyCharlies,2,Fri Apr 17 09:15:50 2015 UTC,"please understand these community driven tribe remakes have been done so many times before they are largely a joke at this point  especially when the person leading this current one that will attempt to commercialize itself has also lead various failed and terrible attempts in the past  regardless this isn't really what i wanted to talk about here  my only point in this whole thing was that the chance of lawsuit against archetype games interests me and i think it is likely  your reading comprehension level is so low you consider a person interested in the legal aspects of IP and copyright to be ""bitching"" so why you'd ask my opinion on commercializing indi dev tribes knock offs or if the genre is doomed would just be a waste of time on my part to answer"
Tribes,32v151,Mindflayr,2,Fri Apr 17 14:18:14 2015 UTC,"I am very curious where you are getting your info from. I have known Bugs for many years (since we met at multiple TribesCon's), and this is his involvement with past ""remake attempts"".  1) He (with help) ran a Mod called Great Tribal War for T2 which was playable and awesome. They Later tried to port that mod to other versions of the game but it never made it due to those games failure.   2) One of those games they tried moving it to Ascension by Renwerx (Not 2 seperate projects, Renwerx was the group, ascension was their game), but to my knowledge he was never part of their team.   3) The Legends team is listed Right Here and is not connected to the Project Z team that i know of unless people changed names.  4) The Only ""Full Game"" BugsPrae was involved with before PZ was Legions, which was created by GarageGames and then the Community Devs took over when the game was already abandoned, and considering what they started with (Code and Community Wise) they did a pretty good job with Legions.  5) Here is my reply from the other day about the PZ team vs Other Tribes Projects attempted:   1) They were going to make Legions 2. Then They decided to make their own project, so avid fans of the franchise already knew this team existed, and that they were working on something. To ""Throw us a bone"" and keep us in the loop they have slowly leaked minor assets so we know progress is being made. but if you notice they have a very simple web presence and arent spenting time trying to overly hype something that isnt ready for it yet. They arent trying to ""raise anticipation"", they are just letting us know they hve a heartbeat and didnt drift off into a coma like every other community based team that has tried to make a tribes like game and blew their ""hype load"" early and never finished.  2) While I can't claim to know their professional credentials, these gentlemen started working on Legions at a code level many years ago. Mabel and I don;t get along at all, and yet he is a genius when it comes to his game work and his vision of what makes tribes mechanics good is excellent. BugsPray is a friend i Have met on multiple occasions and has been dedicated to this vision for years, and I think the Art team speaks for itself with what we have seen. They were very selective of who they included in their team, rather than having an ""Open Casting Call"" like almost all of the previous projects tried, as every single person in this group isn't just a Tribes Enthusiast Pseudo-Developer, but they are all looking to make a Career out of this, and this is their Mona Lisa. Hopefully it will be awesome and appreciated before they are dead.... but Of all of the Attempts so far I think they have the best chance of completing something that could gain popularity.  Past Attempts:     Legends (2005-2007) - Fairly Polished Standalone game but never gained large player base     Renwerx: Ascension (2007-2008) - Died in development     Crysis Mod: Rise (2008) - Died in development     ET:QW Mod Tribal Wars (2010) - Basic ""Light Tribes"" gameplay finished with 3 Maps but Never Popular as it was Just a Mod     Legacy (2013-2014) - Standalone Unity Game - Single Developer - Died in Development"

Tribes,32vlyl,prettzl,2,Sat Apr 18 21:37:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a Mayan Calendar.   With the new curtains, the entire living room gets blacked out. No worries there. :)   I can't wait until it's all done. Been working on the house for weeks.   The PC is my reward. If I got it sooner, nothing would get done.   I am finishing the floors tonight.   Furniture goes in tomorrow, and the setup begins."
Tribes,32vlyl,Dodgesabre,2,Sat Apr 18 21:47:59 2015 UTC,Good: Sensible not going with a 4790k as with your uses its not really needed.   Your ram gives you room to add more if you ever need to which you probably wont.  hmmm: Why have you spent that much extra on that motherboard? I fail to see what you have gained over a lesser board considering your running a single GPU and average overclock?  The features you paid extra for are pretty much worthless to you. A motherboard wouldn't have been the limiting factor in any overclocking you could possibly achieve with that cpu cooler.  I really hope you have included a decent SSD from a previous build or something.  Whats with the 980ftw spamming? Just get a normal 980 if you do and dont waste more money on something you wont really make use of.  Nioce Rig btw.  Maybe we should have a post your rig thread again. Btw what monitor do you have? 120hz+ is a great upgrade if you dont have one already.
Tribes,32vlyl,evanvolm,2,Fri Apr 17 16:02:41 2015 UTC,"Yes. I have an SSD from my laptop I bought just before it (my laptop) died. Samsung 840 EVO 250g.  My monitor is the Asus 24in 3D ready 144hz monitor, that I have been using with my laptop, but was never able to take advantage of the refresh rate. Because my laptop couldn't push it out.   So that will be new to me as well.   The motherboard is more of a personal decision. I know it's overkill (price) for what it delivers. Idk, I like it. Just a last minute impulse buy from my original EVGA Z97 FTW 1150 I was going for.   As for the 980, well... With EVGA, if you buy any of their flag ship models, and you have issues whilst under warranty (limited lifetime), then they replace it with the newest series of the same version.   Eg: my buddy bought the 580 ftw way back when. He started having problems, so he did a trouble call, etc...  In the end it was found that the card was the issue, so they sent him a replacement of a 780. Don't remember if it was an ftw, so, or the like. But, he got a brand new card, that was even better.   Hence my reasoning."

And probably better power delivery for overclocking.  I woulda gotten the FTW and spent the money saved on an i7 4790k, but there's no denying that's a pretty sweet mobo"
Tribes,32vlyl,Dodgesabre,1 point,Fri Apr 17 05:14:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was looking for a good solid footing for the rest of the build. There are other better rated MOBOs , but my laptop I been playing on for the last 5+ years was an MSI GT 660 R. And... It did me good, so I figured I would give this one a go. It's kinda their new flag ship for Z97 1150.  If I have issues, changes will be made.   As far as the 4790k, I still can. I have local friends irl , that will take it off my hands (they just don't play Tribes (losers :P))."

Tribes,32lcvj,prettzl,-8,Wed Apr 15 20:51:51 2015 UTC,"I'm poorly soluble at best, good try though. You should have said ""can we throw you in a toilet and reunite you with your kind?""

Nice try though, hope that university/college/drivel you're going through is helping you learn things. I'd love to believe it is.  :3"

I've chosen not to join them in their boring game mode. Just like a lot of the newblood and Failhards that abandon the game these days.  What's defensive about that?  They keep playing, they keep killing the population of the game off with boredom.  vgw pugs~ SARCASM"

Tribes,32lcvj,prettzl,-4,Tue Apr 14 21:16:07 2015 UTC,"Ah, so I'm not being defensive.  Thanks for clearing that up; I doubt I'd have known otherwise.  I've been saying the same thing for going on 3 years now, I know that no matter what I post on on /r/tribes that I am not just ""starting"" shit I am redirecting the attention of the remaining community at an ancient pile of shit that will continue to grow until the game dies completely.  It's pretty funny because I didn't make it. They did.  But being mad with me is easier than trying to fix the issue.  It's not a fundamental problem with the game itself, or with the developers who abandoned it, it's how the PUG community is ran by an echelon of fools who refuse to change and refuse to expand their skills beyond their narrow focus.  They remain entrenched like ticks to their flawed standard, it's no wonder Hi-Rez left. T:A was NEVER going to be the game that PUG failhards wanted.  :3"
Tribes,32lcvj,justasyuuki,6,Tue Apr 14 19:47:15 2015 UTC,What change would you make to the PUG ruleset? I'm curious.
Tribes,32lcvj,prettzl,-2,Tue Apr 14 20:01:10 2015 UTC,"I know that it falls on mostly deaf ears, but whatever. You asked.   Smaller team sizes (5v5) No Bans on load outs whatsoever Naked Spawn Base management returned to primary focus (T1 style) Only in game communication allowed No call downs at all No vehicles at all   Making call downs and vehicles the only difference between pub and pug play  If you can't coordinate a team of 5 with vgs and player spotting keys then you're bad."
Tribes,32lcvj,krokooc,2,Tue Apr 14 21:11:46 2015 UTC,"i can see it be almost a good idea, if pugs continue... There should be a matchmaking system with almost what you suggest (i do not agree with everything, but whatever) AND pugs/comp so there is a higher tier without stomping (put a decent sniper/inf and its a stomp for the team who got it with the rules you suggest if the other have none)  I think we tried naked spawn, and it turned in a turtle the gen fest because a decent brute/jugg is all you need against pth in small areas.  mines (for your loadouts part) are bugged, see Mstarr post he remade a week ago, and cant really be used on some map without using undestructible mine, glitched etc.  But whatever, you're not that wrong, but why hate on pugs, which are different from what you ask for (a casual/matchmaking oriented 5v5). In game, to me it can work. With good coordination, without some tweaks, with what hirez left, i cant see it as a really viable thing"

It will probably be this coming Sunday since the drafts are taking up the weekends after.  I still won't be able to be there in person (I have work during the best times to have it) but I'll have someone I trust be there in my place. In the meantime I need some serious help on getting mentors involved. Being 5 hours behind GMT doesn't make it easy to get time to talk to EU guys about stuff. I also don't know many people in EU so if people who are interested in mentoring could make an effort to reach out that would be so helpful.

Bugs is a good Project lead as well, and they had a Playable Alpha at PAX 7 months ago. They did not want to put anything like a video of gameplay out there until it was closer to being available and in a fairly polished state, because they didnt want a bunch of Hype for a game nobody would be able to try for a year. Give them time, these guys know what made the previous Iterations great, and will give us a great game. Will it reach as many players as T:A, who knows, but it will be worth the wait."
Tribes,32a23o,Mindflayr,0,Mon Apr 13 15:40:30 2015 UTC,"I completely understand not wanting to preview gameplay until the game is at a point closer to completion. But this raises the question why they would bother unveiling the game so early out in the first place, only to release nothing but a handful of unfinished art assets that do little to raise anticipation for the game.  They may know what has made previous games great, but what makes them a talented team? Are they experienced in game development to any professional degree, or is this a bunch of guys that were essentially modders trying their hand at their own project? Let's be real here: without experienced professionals, a publisher, and a decent budget the odds of executing a quality title (even if they understand at a design level what makes the series enjoyable) are low."

To ""Throw us a bone"" and keep us in the loop they have slowly leaked minor assets so we know progress is being made. but if you notice they have a very simple web presence and arent spenting time trying to overly hype something that isnt ready for it yet. They arent trying to ""raise anticipation"", they are just letting us know they hve a heartbeat and didnt drift off into a coma like every other community based team that has tried to make a tribes like game and blew their ""hype load"" early and never finished.   2) While I can't claim to know their professional credentials, these gentlemen started working on Legions at a code level many years ago. Mabel and I don;t get along at all, and yet he is a genius when it comes to his game work and his vision of what makes tribes mechanics good is excellent. BugsPray is a friend i Have met on multiple occasions and has been dedicated to this vision for years, and I think the Art team speaks for itself with what we have seen. They were very selective of who they included in their team, rather than having an ""Open Casting Call"" like almost all of the previous projects tried, as every single person in this group isn't just a Tribes Enthusiast Pseudo-Developer, but they are all looking to make a Career out of this, and this is their Mona Lisa. Hopefully it will be awesome and appreciated before they are dead.... but Of all of the Attempts so far I think they have the best chance of completing something that could gain popularity.  Past Attempts:     Legends (2005-2007) - Fairly Polished Standalone game but never gained large player base     Renwerx: Ascension (2007-2008) - Died in development    Crysis Mod: Rise (2008) - Died in development  ET:QW Mod Tribal Wars (2010) - Basic ""Light Tribes"" gameplay finished with 3 Maps but Never Popular as it was Just a Mod     Legacy (2013-2014) - Standalone Unity Game - Single Developer -  Died in Development"
Tribes,32a23o,Mindflayr,2,Tue Apr 14 16:38:27 2015 UTC,"A lot of companies do it. It's usually because they want new talent. Their dev team has expanded recently, in fact. They didn't really just mod Legions, they had to rewrite most of the code. They made many positive changes to the game, like a better netcode and a more balanced weapon set. The odds of them executing a quality title are higher than ever with UE4 and full access to the source code of games like the new Unreal Tournament."

Tribes,32a23o,Zwitterions,6,Sun Apr 12 13:42:46 2015 UTC,They deserve at least as much of a chance as Hi-Rez got.  They're trying to make a game that Tribes players will enjoy.  Who cares if it ends up sucking? They deserve some respect for trying.  It's far more than most people do for this game or the genre.

Tribes,32a23o,ropeadoped,-1,Sun Apr 12 09:32:46 2015 UTC,"While I hope that they do, I do think that it is unlikely they will be successful. The previous track record of ""home made"" Tribes projects has established that."
Tribes,32a23o,AFireInAsa,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:40:18 2015 UTC,"They were all amateur. This one is a large bit more professional in terms of the amount of employees, resources going into it, and tools used to create it. UE4 is the best engine ever made for a small project like this to succeed. Right now, a large portion of the Tribes playerbase are left without a Tribes game they enjoy. This hasn't always been the case because Tribes 1 and 2 had fairly large, stable userbases for years. Now that time is coming to an end, and after the fuss about Hi-Rez and T:A, now is the best time for a new game to succeed."

For the captains, you make it clear to a small, competent number of people attending the draft that if there's a shortage, they might be the one drawing the short straw. Just reduce the sample size is all.   The cappers would be voting on maps along with everyone else who's actually playing. Again, it's not likely to matter but it still could."

Tribes,322i7c,raptor3x,7,Fri Apr 10 18:39:02 2015 UTC,Is the hard part of HoFing in america stopping cappers?
Tribes,322i7c,Melur,2,Fri Apr 10 22:38:11 2015 UTC,"ITC I discover I'm a massive sperg, use too many parentheticals and am a #salty NA HoF  Not necessarily (depends on the skill level of the capper and offense), but reach adds a level of complexity that EU HoFs don't have to deal with.  Bodyblocks in NA are a much less sure way of stopping a capper because of the increased grab distance, so positioning/stand awareness becomes far more important, because you can't just hide from offense then afk on flag to get the stop.  Last-second spots become far less stops in NA because the capper can position so well to get around you. Reach also makes it far more difficult to get a body-block stop on a capper when you have offense on you, as positioning has to be far more precise to actually get in the cappers path across the stand, and that precise positioning can be hard to achieve when you have someone pressing F repeatedly and a raider spamming GL on the stand.  Surviving on stand vs. offense is arguably more difficult in NA than EU because of Safety 3rd being available to give people unreasonable numbers and sizes of pineapples to hurl at the stand.  Four Frag XLs, if nothing else, forces the HoF completely off the stand to avoid eating 4k dmg.  Jetting up above grenades is essentially only an option if you already have a spot on cap and he is imminent, as you'll get perfect chained instantly if the offense is at all competent (and while that chain is less damage than the grenades, it still can take up to half your health in seconds).  Jetting above grenades only extends your life slightly on stand (and you lose BRT shield).  F spam causes problems especially on a stand like Kata, where there's no where to go but down off the edge of the stand, where you can easily be EMP'd and you become a non-issue for the incoming capper.  Essentially HoFing in NA is very different than in EU, and (in my opinion) much more difficult.  This is all based on ruleset, and I think it's worth mentioning that the two rulesets are custom-made and tailored to each community's playerbase, with average chain in EU being much better than NA due to ping.  Better chain benefits offense more than anyone (except probably LD), and as such certain nerfs are used to keep the O/D balance as even as possible.  TL;DR Stopping cappers is harder in NA than in EU because reach, surviving offense in NA is also harder because Safety 3rd (Solely based on ruleset, I'm not commenting as to relative average skill level of NA offense players vs EU)"
Tribes,322i7c,qhp,4,Sun Apr 12 01:26:10 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily (depends on the skill level of the capper and offense), but reach adds a level of complexity that EU HoFs don't have to deal with.   I don't think this difference is as significant as you're making it out to be.  It can be a major difference on DX and for routes on other maps where there are a very narrow range of approach angles (i.e. back-right on BE kata or hallway routes on Arx) but in general the quality of the capper's explosive clear is just as, if not more, important (i.e. fuck Bloody's twinfusor routes).   Surviving on stand vs. offense is arguably more difficult in NA than EU because of Safety 3rd being available to give people unreasonable numbers and sizes of pineapples to hurl at the stand.   I agree that EMP XL's on Kata with safety third suck but other than that I don't think safety third makes that big of a difference.  Honestly, I would gladly go up against the ~S3 NA style offense + safety third rather than dealing with the Euro style offense where you have to play chicken against three soldier semi-routes in addition to watching for the capper.   Essentially HoFing in NA is very different than in EU, and (in my opinion) much more difficult.   I'll agree that it's different but I'm not sure that it's all that much harder, it mostly just requires adjustments to the strategy of how you position the LD."
Tribes,322i7c,Zwitterions,3,Sun Apr 12 21:51:40 2015 UTC,"well i wouldn't say hofing in eu is that difficult.   It was this comment that bothered me. First of all I think HoF is the hardest role to play, by far. However, I think stopping cappers is the easy part of it. I always expect a HoF to win a 1v1 with a capper. Staying alive, knowing when to hide and when to fight is the hard part.  On top of that I played some scrims with a mix of some european players against top NA teams sometime during EUTL s3. The biggest difference I saw was in the HoFs. They had never seen a semi-route before and they could barely touch our capper. It was pretty disappointing to be honest.  Sure, reach makes HoFing harder and I have no clue why you guys still have st3 allowed but I can't accept ""hofing in eu isn't that difficult."""

Tribes,31zg61,nordsmark,6,Thu Apr 9 12:23:42 2015 UTC,This happened just yesterday and I thought it was worth posting. It's really easy to get so focused on your aim that you forget all about your movement. Sometimes in a duel you'll do better by avoiding being hit rather than trying to get the kill first.
Tribes,31zg61,Mindflayr,5,Thu Apr 9 10:46:01 2015 UTC,"I've taught about 20 friends tribes since 98 in T1, and Lesson Number 1, even before skiing is... Focus on Movement and Staying alive first, shooting 2nd. Anybody that focuses on Shooting first (often from playing shit 1 hit kill games) ends up dead to anybody that understands movement 1st."

Tribes,321d01,fireboat,13,Thu Apr 9 20:06:21 2015 UTC,"Good read!  In my opinion it would be better to have leagues of player classification and styles of play be matched against their mirrors and then have the top of each league compete against each other rather than an ELO style trickle upward bracket.  But eh, maybe that's jes me.  Noobs playing noobs (everybody at first)  Casuals playing casuals (solo queue)  Tryhards playing tryhards (teams)  Trying to tryhards playing Trying to tryhards (duos, trios, new teams)  Until ultimately all of each leagues best play against eachother to determine the best of the best league champion.  Maybe even let people choose initially where they WANT to or think they should be placed and let observation and encouragement to succeed be a part of the league system to direct them in to the appropriate pool of competitors."

Tribes,31yzjc,nordsmark,5,Thu Apr 9 14:25:25 2015 UTC,"Games are for fun.   I beg to differ. Games can be just for fun, but they can also be more. Sports can be played just for fun, but if you want to and you're capable, it can be more. Reading a book can just be fun, but it can also invoke other emotions, such as sadness, anger, compassion, etc.  Being competitive and/or getting emotionally involved in what you do, be that gaming or whatever other activity you choose to occupy your time with, is not somehow wrong. I would even argue that spending a lot of time on something that you don't really feel invested in emotionally is a waste of time."

Tribes,31waea,ArmoredPenguin94,3,Wed Apr 8 18:38:47 2015 UTC,I believe the link he is talking about will be just a fancy shmancy google sheet that keeps track of who has signed up & who hasn't.   So you just sign up by email or in thread & then Lazy puts it in the Sheet so everyone can see who signed up & what roles they are playing. Also useful for when the picking happens as Captains have a clear-ish list of ppl & roles to choose from.

Tribes,31waea,hobowithabazooka,2,Mon Apr 20 15:15:45 2015 UTC,It's a weekend long 7v7 tournament. The teams are picked from the players signed up.   Rulesets are changed off the top of my head these are the differences:   7 cap limit No base assests No inf stealth 1 sent limit No mines/tech turrets No soldier/tech quickfuses No raider plasma No proxies
Tribes,31waea,revofire,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:08:48 2015 UTC,I see. I was thinking I could make a website that has a sign up with match line-ups and results inputted manually or pulled from a Tribes tracker API.

He played mostly during the time before HoFs and the only reason he tapered off during the end of his career was because HoFs became more important to a team than soldier stay-at-home defense. This was because of all the shit Hi-Rez added to Doombringers (they didn't even have mines for the longest time) and people figuring out how to abuse them.

Tribes,31kzor,qhp,2,Mon Apr 6 02:43:15 2015 UTC,"Yep. There is not much you can learn from 1-on-1 advice with capping. It all comes down to practice and route knowledge. In fact, if you want to be a more valuable capper, you should practice offense (killing/dueling). A capper who can only cap is useless in every other situation."

Tribes,31kzor,LXZY,1 point,Mon Apr 6 04:09:40 2015 UTC,"I think that knowing what length routes too run is something very important, and tbh not all that many cappers know how to do it. If there is anything the capping workshop does other than give them kiga's/soni's videos then that should be it."
Tribes,31kzor,qhp,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:18:49 2015 UTC,"This is something that is so situational I'm not sure you could scratch the surface of the possibilities. It comes down to skill level of the individual players on the opposing team in each position (including their offense and capper), on top of their playstyle, on top of the enemy teams offensive timing. It is certainly something worth discussing and theory crafting about, but not something I would include in a ""newblood workshop."""
Tribes,31kzor,Loxiasus,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:22:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not really agree with you!! To have a good experience of capping and sync offence, you have to learn some things in capping. Like communicate properly (ask BEFORE running your route if the offence is ready, spot cappers, self clear, decide which route you gonna run depending on the position of sniper, the cowboy, etc...) :)"

Tribes,31hc9r,qhp,8,Sun Apr 5 02:12:57 2015 UTC,"Nice, as always! Such a treat to see your stuff, man. The clip that starts at 1:55 is fucking awesome.  The clip at 5:16 makes me depressed, as a capper. It wasn't until the end of my Tribes play that snipers I was playing against got this good at shooting. I went from liking Arx to hating it very quickly. A good sniper will absolutely carry his defense on Arx and you show that here. Against a player as good as this, you just feel hopeless.  BTW: I much prefer sacrificing syncing to have longer clips. The longer and consistently good clips are far more impressive than any 10-second 2-shot miracle plays. Do not feel bad for not being able to sync well with these clips (you still sync'd pretty well, fwiw).  Also if you haven't listened to Crying Over Pros for No Reason, the classic album, I'd definitely recommend it. I recently got it on red splatter vinyl and it's fuckin beautiful. I don't even have a record player."
Tribes,31hc9r,qhp,6,Sun Apr 5 07:25:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, arx can be a nightmare for cappers. It has gotten a lot better tho when people started soldier capping. Lange as main cap for example was always really sneaky and hard to spot at spawn (harder than others anyway). Offense also has become a lot better with semi grabs etc. which kept you busy while the capper already started another route.  Will definitely check out that music later, ty."

The way you swap between targets to keep them at bay, basically controlling how they have to play, is beautiful. So many times in those clips where you could've gone full fragwhore, as many others would've, but you always seem to pick the right way to deal with situation instead.

Tribes,31gnd7,persuasionlaser,1 point,Sun Apr 5 20:23:27 2015 UTC,"ppl wanna play videogaem on that day tho  also is np if its on the same day, just a couple players less for each draft nbd"
Tribes,31gnd7,ArmoredPenguin94,2,Sun Apr 5 20:53:15 2015 UTC,"kinda is tho, if mericans are gunna be waking up early for eu draft then I doubt they'll stay up for NA draft. Also NA draft had 4 teams last time so they really need the players."
Tribes,31gnd7,Theheartattack,2,Tue Apr 7 04:46:28 2015 UTC,"If such a situation occurs, I'd expect the mericans to prioritize NA draft over EU.   Which is fine as even without the NA ppl, EU draft should have 6-7 teams easily."
Tribes,31gnd7,ArmoredPenguin94,7,Tue Apr 7 10:14:18 2015 UTC,"If newbloods is 12th, and next eu draft is 25th, then I'd rather postpone NA until May.   As good teachers we may think ourselves to be, it's not all going to stick and repeated practice is necessary for teamwork to happen effectively. 18th is not a good date because of this. 25th is better, but still might be too early. I'd want a couple of weeks for the new guys to play before doing something so competitive like a draft, where tryharding is going to occur.   Wait longer, collect funds, be prepared to alter pug play a bit for the betterment of new players."

Tribes,31hicw,zombieofthepast,2,Sun Apr 5 05:29:10 2015 UTC,"You joined a team and started shooting us in the middle of a duel because we weren't responding instantly as to when we would be done using our own duel server so that you could use it.  That's not ok, not sure if you realize that.  Banning you was a joke, I'm sure you have other duel servers.  Gladmir's Perfect Chain is angrypolak's server, not mine so fuck off."
Tribes,31hicw,angrypolak1,-2,Mon Apr 6 03:27:35 2015 UTC,"Not true at all. I stayed in spectator mode and asked ""what time will you guys be done?"" You then banned me and when I asked why you said something along the lines of ""I don't want you spilling blood on my server."" I don't join duels that are in progress. I'm not an asshole, which is more than can be said of you. If the other server is polak's, then I apologize for my assumption. polak also appears to be an egocentric douche bag, so I can certainly what you say."
Tribes,31hicw,fireboat,2,Mon Apr 6 04:04:28 2015 UTC,"I think I was streaming the duel, I can go find the part where you join a team if you really don't believe me.  Regardless, bitching about it on reddit is not exactly the move of someone who's not an asshole.  You could have just pm'd me about it when I wasn't dueling, and I would probably have tried my best to find you a server you could duel in.  I know the passwords to most of the duel servers that are left, and I'm happy to let people use them that aren't going to mess with others using those servers."
Tribes,31hicw,saturntribes,2,Mon Apr 6 05:49:23 2015 UTC,"No need. I searched my memory and realized that you were right, I did join after asking in spec and getting no response. I thought that maybe the server had been set to mute spectators, since that is an option in many games. Not sure if it is in tribes. Anyway, apologies for the false accusation.  I still think the ban unwarranted. If it was a joke, it has been a long running one. You could have just asked me to spec or kicked me. However, it's your server and therefore you call the shots. Sorry for intruding on your duel. It was also wrong of me to resort to an ad hominem. Sorry for that. It has been removed from the OP. I think I'm just annoyed with a lot of people in the community, as they apparently are annoyed with me as well."

A good sniper can make it so the enemy can't get close enough to be a real threat. Also, your secondaries can be abused.   My suggestion, just play another class.

Tribes,317tw1,krokooc,6,Thu Apr 2 18:57:45 2015 UTC,"Since your montage focuses on one mechanic - it should be much shorter and much more selective.  Especially for flag passing - show some odd angle passes, punt passes, passes where you're being chased or avoiding a shrike, e-grab to capper en route pass, really just anything to give it context.   1ft passes from a guy directly in front of you going 60sanics isn't going to get you any upvotes.

Tribes,30w9gj,sh4z,1 point,Tue Mar 31 22:03:04 2015 UTC,Do 2v2 instead! makes it a team game and stops ppl from just kiting each other for 3 minutes per kill.
Tribes,30w9gj,FreII,2,Tue Mar 31 07:53:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 2v2 is more strategic and fun imo. 1v1 is more for training and not for a tournament. Furthermore, after each kill, all is reset, then, even if a guy is just a little bit better than an other, there might have a huge difference of kills."
Tribes,30w9gj,DarcseeD,2,Tue Mar 31 08:40:51 2015 UTC,Sorry but I think 1v1 is more interesting.

Tribes,30w9gj,sh4z,1 point,Tue Mar 31 11:17:10 2015 UTC,"The lesson to be learned here is to mute your mic or use push to talk. Raging is fine as long as you keep playing and don't bother your team. :P   Anyway, I really wish modding was possible, so spawn locations could be changed in order to remove all the randomness. I'm sure Hi-Rez will release mod tools soon."
Tribes,30w9gj,Obyeag,3,Tue Mar 31 11:30:14 2015 UTC,"Kennet didn't hit his push to talk in that clip, Schreq didn't hear him. Regarding Lester's comment I don't think anyone played as much 2v2 as Kennet, so I doubt the rage was about how much he hated the gamemode.  My biggest issue with the 1v1/2v2 Gameshrine ladders were brutes. The random spawns are definitely annoying but if anyone put up a 2v2 soldier tournament in europe today I would play."
Tribes,30w9gj,LXZY,2,Tue Mar 31 17:55:22 2015 UTC,Brutes are fkn aids in 2v2s why would any class other than SLD be allowed.
Tribes,30w9gj,FreII,3,Wed Apr 1 22:23:03 2015 UTC,"we wanted it to be fair to everyone or something. I don't know tho, no brute team managed to beat me and kennet (or if it was me and knutsson) while playing 2v2. I'm pretty sure you can always outplay brutes in 2v2 due to how slow they are. Also I personally liked being able to switch out to pathfinder for a quick kill, or going raider to soak some damage for your team mate. SLD is still the ultimate duel class, so disallowing the other classes doesn't really make sense to me since everyone should be playing SLD anyway"

Allow all maps, maybe with pick/ban process, or just have loser pick map after the first one being walled in.   Just do soldiers for simplicity, no quickfuses or proxies.

Tribes,30w9gj,prettzl,2,Tue Mar 31 11:52:15 2015 UTC,It's not my fault you're a shitter and don't pay attention. All you have to do is look around the map to know where your enemy respawned and you should see them well before they throw a nade or get close enough to groundpound.

Tribes,30w9gj,sh4z,-1,Tue Mar 31 18:58:43 2015 UTC,"Seems like people only get shot in the back in 1v1 because they're used to gentleman's rules and never had to position properly and watch spawns to avoid being surprised.

Tribes,30ukwq,krokooc,13,Thu Apr 2 16:13:57 2015 UTC,i think snipers should record because most good snipers already have pretty good fps already and recording a 240p video wouldn't cost that much performance.   P.S Still waiting for Eaks vod  P.P.S.  You can put my money to next draft or heart's child charity.

Tribes,30ukwq,Loxiasus,7,Tue Mar 31 23:07:40 2015 UTC,"Because he was toggleboxing. He was called out in every match, and if he chose not to record it's easy to see why."

Tribes,30ukwq,ACDtubes,-5,Tue Mar 31 20:05:11 2015 UTC,"I have the record, some minutes in matches, because i use the copy mode in Shadowplay, and i save it when i got a clip. I can share my clips, or 5 minutes in 2 maps, but nothing more because i don't have something else or i don't have enough conection for upload too much files. Also, there was any Admin that asked me for that... So i don't really think it's a real problem for me actually. I'll show it when an Admin will come with some ppl like you who rly want to see it... In addition Angry, you saw my record vs Soninova on Tartarus and Arx Novena (when he thoought i was toggleboxing) It's one youtube and i showed that it wasn't toggle, should i make it again and all the time when i'll snipe ?"
Tribes,30ukwq,Fulled,11,Wed Apr 1 11:19:14 2015 UTC,"To be honest, you could just record the full match, render it in Sony Vegas (it'll reduce the size by ALOT) & then upload overnight.  That's what I used to do and had somewhere around 0.5Mbps upload."

Tribes,30ukwq,D1eze,3,Wed Apr 1 16:45:02 2015 UTC,"He uploaded 18 minutes at 1080p60, meaning he can equivalently upload 12 times at 480p30 (which should be enough) in that time. Which is roughly day 1..."

Tribes,30ukwq,Fulled,5,Wed Apr 1 18:40:30 2015 UTC,upload at 10 fps 240p. good enough to show you're legit and would take 20 minutes to upload if those numbers are right
Tribes,30ukwq,hobowithabazooka,3,Wed Apr 1 20:40:38 2015 UTC,Seems to me that people want to see the recordings so show them.  Also for next time it will be better if you record the entire matches. If you are not cheating you have nothing to worry about and it will give everyone proof that you do not cheat.
Tribes,30ukwq,eightnine,3,Wed Apr 1 11:46:08 2015 UTC,"Seems to me that people want to see the recordings so show them.          He says he only has saved 5 minutes in 2 matches, that's not enough to judge if he was toggleboxing, he just saved the clips where he wasn't. Useless.       Also for next time it will be better if you record the entire matches.           It's not just better, it's completely useless if he doesn't (or if every other sniper doesn't). And next time? Is he just gonna get a free pass on this? We know he can record full matches and upload them as he has done in the past so I can't understand how it's ok to have that huge discussion on snipers having to record and then not follow up with anything concrete.               We all expected to play clean games or at least to be able to check if anything dirty happened on the snipers side, this shouldn't be brushed aside so easily."
Tribes,30ukwq,Maatin,3,Wed Apr 1 12:25:07 2015 UTC,He did record in the past? Interesting.   We'll discuss this internally and see whether or not to allow Eaks to play in the next one or not.   I'd still like to see those recordings /u/Fulled. And I'm really hoping you wouldn't do something utterly pathetic as cheat in PUGs or Draft Tournaments.
Tribes,30ukwq,Theheartattack,8,Wed Apr 1 12:30:36 2015 UTC,"You'd be surprised the lengths people go to, to win.  It's pathetic really, it's a dying game with a small community of people and this still happens!  Not pointing any fingers but I will laugh my ass off next time he records and gets 0 spots & 10 kills."

I'm not saying you're bad, I was saying it would be funny if you only got 10 kills and little spots the next time you recorded a game.  You should prove everybody wrong and record ENTIRE matches next time. It really isn't much effort, you can clear your name too."

Tribes,30ukwq,leukos,3,Wed Apr 1 15:30:02 2015 UTC,but your recording of tartarus was you shooting the capper after you got the spot. Anyone could just cut off the part of finding the capper with boxes and then turn them off.

Tribes,30ukwq,LittleAscended,5,Wed Apr 1 00:09:47 2015 UTC,"thanks a lot for organizing armed,you did a great job there! feedback: a strawpoll is kinda fucked up because its easy to ""manipulate"". also id like to see something forcing some people to atleast record(coughfulledcough). it was still really fun to play and thanks to my teammates(shaz jamie schreq a9/h3art ensis and intopus)!"
Tribes,30ukwq,Fulled,2,Tue Mar 31 22:13:31 2015 UTC,"I know the strawpoll can be easily manipulated, that's the entire reason for the Captain Vote."
Tribes,30ukwq,eightnine,5,Wed Apr 1 11:07:26 2015 UTC,"I thought it was a great draft, despite getting somewhat crushed. One issue that came up before it started was that someone who had only checked the first mega thread didn't realize he had to check in on the day itself on top of signing up. Given that it was only mentioned in the thread that was posted the day before (or at least in a separate thread from the initial one) I can understand where he's coming from. That's easily amended by just making sure you mention that check ins on the day are a thing in the initial sign up thread though.  Short of that the only issue was that the whole snipers recording/streaming thing wasn't stated by any admins as a definite rule, which I think it should have. Admittedly any sen with a bit of sense who wasn't before would have started recording after that jp thread, but I think we can all agree that fulled might be somewhat lacking in that department, so I would personally be willing to give him a free pass this time around and simply make the rule very clear for next time."
Tribes,30ukwq,tumii,2,Wed Apr 1 16:09:24 2015 UTC,One issue that came up before it started was that someone who had only checked the first mega thread didn't realize he had to check in on the day itself on top of signing up   My bad.   I guess I just assumed everyone knew about the check-in (its been that way since the first draft I remember). Didn't put it in the megathread because I tried not to make it too much of a wall of text.  Will def put it in next time.
Tribes,30ukwq,sh4z,3,Thu Apr 2 10:47:39 2015 UTC,"Right, about the /u/Fulled situation.   We have decided it wouldn't be right to ban him for a rule that wasn't official. For what's worth, I personally believe his reasons for only shadowplaying some parts and not fully recording like last time.   However, from now on it will be an official rule of Drafts that every sniper has to stream or record* (if record he needs to provide vods up to 1 week after draft is over). Failure to record/provide the vods will result in a ban from the next draft. If cheating is found, ban from all drafts.  I've also spoken to Fulled and advised him to record everytime so if someone calls him out he can just show him proof that he isn't cheating. So that should put an end to it.   *I'll put this in clear letters in the next megapost when the next draft date is decided. Its looking like it will be the 25-26 April weekend atm."
Tribes,30ukwq,Maatin,2,Sat Apr 4 12:22:35 2015 UTC,"I am releasing a heavy weight, I can play again and being comfortable. I would and i will take the capture of my games in drafts for get any problems. I now have the obligation (personal) to record my Drafts game (when i snipe). Now is the question, do i have to record my games in pugs (when i snipe) ?  I think, i'm gonna record these games but i'll upload only when someone is thinking that i'm using kind of cheats. So if someone isn't agreeing with my plays during a pug, tell me to upload it (Only sniper). And not all the games, cause i need an entire night for upload 25 minutes.  Thanks."
Tribes,30ukwq,Theheartattack,2,Sat Apr 4 22:48:18 2015 UTC,"3) Eaglee proposed that for the next draft we have a clear protocol regarding subs. So there's no complaining about percieved unfair subs. For one team or the other. What are your thoughts on this? What should the rule be?                If there are a few possible subs just get the 2 captains to agree on one of the subs, if that doesn't happen an admin should step in to ensure fairness. Btw only clearly unfair subs should be disallowed (like Matin subbing in for me), anything else is a no-brainer.   4) Anti-Cheat. Even if I think nobody would be scummy enough to cheat in a draft (wishful thinking I know) its still something that needs to be talked about. jp's thread[8] raised the question and I believe all snipers recorded/streamed. Do we want to make this a rule?           Yes, I won't expand on this as there seems to be a general consensus in the other thread. Plus I think certain snipers were called out during the draft and will need to provide VODs, at least before the next event.            Do we want to make this a rule? And should we expand it to everyone, not just snipers?             No, not everyone has good machines, and we shouldn't limit an already dwindling userbase just to feel safer against cheats. It's easy to enforce it on a single class tho, only people who can record should be allowed to snipe (as per JP's thread).         5) What do you guys think of the Captain Vote format? Strawpoll         I feel like the strawpoll is useless, as EVERYONE can vote (even people who never ever played comp). If you want to do something broader or more democratic than captain votes, you could select 20 random people in the pug channel and ask them before the captain vote.         Good job on the draft btw, I had fun and got to play with cool people (except for drax), even tho any team I play in is gonna suffer a bit on the fragging side."
Tribes,30ukwq,sh4z,2,Tue Mar 31 08:57:11 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to let a big thank you here for the organization, all the captains and lesser players. Although the inital wait (day 1 until picking started) was too long, after that it felt much more organized than the last draft. Playing two maps in a row made the game flow much better, short but well scheduled breakes between matches and the big brake were also all good.  Apart from the organizatorical part I really enjoyed my actual time playing (played more videogaemz this weekend than in the last months \o/) since the teams were very well balanced. 3 Teams with 5 points after group stage, a stale-mate etc. say a lot. Especially Lazy's (my) team had close maps all the time - which is how I like it best, win or lose.  Congrats to the winning team of Jack and the unlucky second placed team of Shaz (who had to play without a9 in the finals?!?).  Thanks to all the casters. The promotion scheduling of the casts could have been better, but still great to see so many people doing it <3"
Tribes,30ukwq,Luuigi,4,Tue Mar 31 11:10:16 2015 UTC,"Losing a9 due to hirez in the finals was of course real sad. I personally think he's the best capper in the game atm. But in the end I'd say it didn't really matter, H3art was probably a stronger player to have on Drydock with his strong D/O crazy flag return play, and on Kata it was so close anyway. GG"
Tribes,30ukwq,Theheartattack,4,Thu Apr 2 01:39:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think A9 would've made a huge difference - he maybe a excellent capper (#1), however, H3art had some really good returns, cluster plays, defending and standoff play in which I think A9 would've lacked.  They're both really good players in their own ways."

Just thought it was sad that the final team was different from the team that played group stage and playoffs, had different strengths and weaknesses etc.  Maybe in the end everything cancels out. Still I dislike subs in the content of a tourney in general (I know they are necessary), no two tribes players contribute the same skillset and thus it does never match - which is beside the point of this thread.

Tribes,30ukwq,LittleAscended,2,Thu Apr 2 08:37:58 2015 UTC,"For the captain thing, to me the best thing is to get the admins to choose captains, ideally players of roughly equal skill, or the likely top picks. If you sign up to play, you are signed up to potentially captain.. However people seem so afraid of being captain that you may end up with less players. It's a painful problem.  Also, you cannot ban Eaks for not recording when we never asked him to record. If you have that rule in the next draft, fine, but to accuse and then ask for proof that he cannot provide after the fact is pointless."

Tribes,30ukwq,Luka666,2,Wed Apr 1 16:03:32 2015 UTC,if that doesn't do enough try downscaling resolution to 640x360 or something. It will look horrendous but it should be plenty to cover any potential recording requirement.

Tribes,30qzrl,TheDaemon89,2,Mon Mar 30 13:34:45 2015 UTC,Did you download it from Steam or from Hi-Rez's website? Generally the Steam version tends to be fickle in whether it works out of the box or not.

Tribes,30ntov,Dodgesabre,6,Sun Mar 29 04:27:55 2015 UTC,2 guys not flying and adad is exactly how I want the Tribes meta to be.
Tribes,30ntov,nordsmark,6,Sun Mar 29 02:56:28 2015 UTC,neither of those two classes have a groundpound. I dunno what you expected
Tribes,30ntov,Dodgesabre,9,Sun Mar 29 03:07:07 2015 UTC,Rdr does have a primary weapon believe it or not though. Mind you the only reason to use it is to force people up in the air so you can chain them.
Tribes,30ntov,sh4z,3,Sun Mar 29 03:22:16 2015 UTC,"It also depends on whether you're using Arx or GL if you actually force them in the air - if you're close range like in this clip and you have GL then you can't really do that, with Arx you could tho. On longer ranges it's more or less the opposite. It also depends whether you're running QD or not, as some RDR's run survivalist or PE 'cus they dunno how to duel with the primary (or just prefer not to idk)."
Tribes,30ntov,Dodgesabre,1 point,Sun Mar 29 10:50:23 2015 UTC,Why doesn't it work with gl? Same thing just area denial. Guess you need to actually be good at aiming for that. XLs are better also but I assume he didn't have any in this clip.
Tribes,30ntov,Will12239,2,Sun Mar 29 11:42:39 2015 UTC,"GL at very close range is just not gonna do much in terms of making people jet because of how it bounces, it's excellent at medium to longish ranges though. Optimal weapon would be plasma, but that's banned in EU as well."
Tribes,30ntov,hobowithabazooka,1 point,Sun Mar 29 12:30:38 2015 UTC,"I usually get caught off guard by it at close range, I think it was martyw who was dueling me with it and kept hitting directs while I was ad'ing.   I don't usually run into the situation where I miss that much chain thanks to the nj4 so I'm no expert on close range gl, cheers."
Tribes,30ntov,Pumpelchce,1 point,Sun Mar 29 21:54:13 2015 UTC,xl's are banned in eu.

Tribes,30ntov,nordsmark,-8,Sun Mar 29 12:12:36 2015 UTC,I expect people to not play shit classes like those. Pubs have slowly devolved into who can troll the best whether it be invisible sen or shielded plasma raiders.
Tribes,30ntov,Lowerend,8,Sun Mar 29 03:08:56 2015 UTC,pubs   implying they havent been shit for years anyways
Tribes,30ntov,jamiemccomb,5,Sun Mar 29 03:30:45 2015 UTC,They haven't. They actually were shit'anized after there was no real comp left and certain ex-comps started flooding the perfectly working pub realm.

Tribes,30oga4,freefoodd,1 point,Sun Mar 29 11:47:36 2015 UTC,I'm from eastern Kentucky and went to UK for undergrad and still here for Pharm school.  Met quite a few kids from Louisville since I've been here. I was raised to hate Louisville but honestly have a pretty good time whenever I go in town.
Tribes,30oga4,Soninova,0,Sun Mar 29 14:38:29 2015 UTC,i was raised to hate kentucky itself (of which louisville is a part) so i suppose i can say the same thing  but wut who are you in tribes

Tribes,30oga4,Dboy187,1 point,Wed Apr 1 03:10:55 2015 UTC,what is your ping normally in cent/east? also for one week did your pings for those servers randomly switch?  somehow despite my city is so much closer to Chicago than Manassas I get 45 ping to cent and 30 to east but for one week I was magically getting 45 to east and 30 to cent. I wondered if you figured any shit out to fix these gei high pings to cent
Tribes,30oxvy,Fulled,3,Sun Mar 29 11:59:02 2015 UTC,"Not all competitions have a 3rd place match.   However, if both teams agree to play it, go for it. It will be at the same time (or earlier if you like) as the Grand Final tho. Otherwise, as Dort said, it would delay the Final too much.   Note that there is no prize for coming 3rd, so it would be purely for bragging rights."

Tribes,30oxvy,WorkingAsIntended,1 point,Sun Mar 29 19:01:01 2015 UTC,I personally don't think this is possible. It would delay the Grand Finals by 1-2 hours and this would be way too late to start. We also cant start earlier because the Murricans are lazy and dont want to get up too soon.

Tribes,30i2r6,reffee,3,Fri Mar 27 17:47:10 2015 UTC,well au doesn't have any good snipers and they don't play kata because of the need for spots
Tribes,30i2r6,Dodgesabre,1 point,Fri Mar 27 18:06:40 2015 UTC,"60% of the routes are often spotted by offense, not by the sniper..."
Tribes,30i2r6,reffee,1 point,Fri Mar 27 23:30:05 2015 UTC,So 40% get home.  320+ sld routes on kata which each have rocks which allow them to change the route half way through or bounce b2f.  Good games aren't games where teams do nothing but stack their best players on D and rely on their capper to get out uncontested.
Tribes,30i2r6,Dodgesabre,4,Sat Mar 28 05:59:45 2015 UTC,"Well, you don't have to be a good SEN to spot 1 side of the map, while the offense spot another side for you... Don't understand what you mean by the other part tho, you can go 320+ sanics routes on every map kind of, so don't know what you mean by that...sure kata is a strong rockbounce map, but it's not rocket sience, most people know the routes by now, even if you bounce on rocks."
Tribes,30i2r6,reffee,2,Sat Mar 28 07:01:54 2015 UTC,"I was just trying to show how strong capping is on a map like kata, speed being the cappers can come at you with only 4 seconds to see them and in this time you usually have to fight off 2 O. If you get a spot you can't say that it's 100% a route for one, people run path routes to inv stations to go O, then there is the bounces on top of that which allow cappers to litterally change their route if they feel like it. We don't constantly have O skiing out wide because they're focus'd on doing their job which is not die to the LD while trying to clear a stand.  Here we have some of the strongest cappers in the game(although bloody hasnt played here in a while) and we are constantly getting new players to play roles which people should have refined by now(like offence, ld, hof ect.). This makes the cappers some of the strongest tools to have (snowie gets picked first over me in pugs for instance) while our other roles are lacking. It doesn't matter how good you are at fragging if your capper gets out without anyone needing to be fragged or without any timing."
Tribes,30i2r6,Dodgesabre,1 point,Sat Mar 28 08:08:42 2015 UTC,"""We don't constantly have O skiing out wide because they're focus'd on doing their job which is not die to the LD while trying to clear a stand.""   First of, it's O job in the current meta to spot cappers wide going wide, that's why you go wide in the first place, to avoid getting spotted/build up speed and to also change if you need to semi grab flags and avoid roam as much as possible. Going straight for the stand sound dumb to me.    Every capper can change routes mid-route, and have always doing that if needed.   ""If you get a spot you can't say that it's 100% a route for one, people run path routes to inv stations to go O""   Well, you can pretty much sort a real route from a fast pth going to call an inv, that's pretty simple, and if he starts doing a route then call inv, people will see that and call it out pretty quick tbh..."
Tribes,30i2r6,pard0n99,1 point,Sat Mar 28 10:15:37 2015 UTC,"Nobody goes straight to the stand, my point is that you will be missing clears or be unavailable for E-grabs while going wide and looking out for spots as effective as a good sniper would. Unless your capper is running 1 route every 2 minutes I guess.   Do you guys have super awareness where each of you are looking at a player all the time over there? I haven't seen anything like what you are describing in NA/AU.   Anyway on topic. Kata sucks on it because the meta evolves into double cowboy cap with no clear due to lack of awareness. You should try out your suggestions and tell me if they work over there. Then link me vod so I can teach newbies pls."

Smite was his idea and was initially created as a mod for GA (while they were bleeding money!)  He was always just as involved with Smite right from the start (alpha, beta, you name it) and continued to be stayed super involved until around Launch.

I have a few ideas of what to do after the workshops are done, but it may not pan out at all so I'm not going to mention those plans here.  The easiest way to fix things is to fix the shitty attitude (at least in NA) towards the state of the game. Naming the pug servers 'pugsded' and making the roles channels in mumble uninformative and really useless don't help either. It's all about the mindset. If you believe that the game can be active again then believe it and try to make it happen. That's what I'm doing (with help from a few others that believe - looking at you, /u/Swordf1sh_ ) and yeah, maybe it wont save comp. Maybe we won't get any new players at all and the whole event will crash and burn, but thinking like that will only make it more likely to happen. Also, at the very least, if everything fails and the game really truly dies, at least we can say we tried, instead of giving up and spewing nonsense like 'it died because hirez' or 'shitty players and hax killed it' or just 'game is ded, gg no re'.   If your game is dead make an effort to revive it. If you have no plans to try and revive the game or at least help then don't complain if it gets to the point that getting one pug a night is a rarity."

And now since I'm a captain I will have to vote, so some reach-discussion seems suitable!  Any Americans who wants to give some insight on how the game plays with reach now? I haven't used the reach perk for probably over 2 years now - or whenever we banned it in EU - and that was with a totally different ruleset (INF, mines etc).  In my mind what playing with reach would change is:   more flags get out more insta-retrieves on stand-offs people would have to decide between rage/looter/reach, often favoring reach   Is there anything else to add to that list? Why should / shouldn't we unban it?"
Tribes,30f3uv,MKRWSeek,2,Thu Mar 26 23:00:29 2015 UTC,"Not really in the mindset to give an in-depth discussion but from what I observed...   1.) There aren't too many more flags getting out, unless your hof relies solely on bodyblocks and has noodle aim.  2.) Batman's are a thing, but insta-retrieves after getting close conks are not that more prevalent (Idk where this 20 second standoff w/ reach idea came up but in NA our standoffs can last quite the long time if both defenses play well)  3.) Since safety third isn't a thing in Euroland, reach would be on probably 95% of classes, considering how much more ability you would have to move the flag. Rage would only be used for crashing/chasing, and looter is almost never used (although with raider it can be fun)  Hope that helps, imo reach isn't that big of a deal, although now every retrieve will be blamed on reach if this gets unbanned, and that WILL get annoying"
Tribes,30f3uv,hobowithabazooka,2,Thu Mar 26 23:30:01 2015 UTC,"slightly more flags get out. Body blocking should be the HOFs absolute last resort anyways.  instaretrieves are still rare. If you get conc-ed in a standoff to begin with, you have bigger problems than instant retrieves. looter is meh. We also have S3 unbanned over here. Having choices isn't a bad thing.   Reach helps high ping cappers. With 100+ ping and without reach, it is very easy to go right through the flag and whiff.  It also makes the HoFs job more difficult(I say this as a HoF). Without Reach, the HoF can park his ass on the flag and go to sleep. Reach creates mind games between the HoF and capper and it puts more emphasis on actually hitting your shots.  There will be some cheesy returns, but those returns will likely be outnumbered by the increase in flags that get out."

Tribes,30f31j,nordsmark,7,Thu Mar 26 21:22:24 2015 UTC,"The TL:DR post mortum.  Last patch was March 12th, 2013.  Kept up the game? Servers are regularly rerouted to regions they do not belong to; AU becoming NA, NA servers shifting to the east (e.g. NA West suddenly becoming NA Central or East upon map rotation.) That's assuming they're still up after they crash during or at the end of the match. Latency is 30-50% higher than other games to the same server region. Performance is subpar in comparison to games with the same engine, game breaking bugs and glitches were improperly fixed or ignored entirely. If anything was going to get done we had to basically come with pitchforks and torches.  Hi-Rez customer service can be related to their approach to bug fixes and game balance. Pester insistently or forget about it. What makes it more painful is that the people employed by Hi-Rez seem to be good people at heart but the manner in which the company is structured and run makes their jobs far more difficult than it has to be. Our experience is similar to Global Agenda, lots of propaganda and interaction but the moment the next project comes out they're suddenly nowhere to be seen and the answering machine is full."

The menu is still broken, some weapons are stupidly balanced, some bugs are here since day one, pubs are shit, vehicle are almost all useless (sry for the gravecycle lovers), competitive banned an entire class because it ruined the small fun we can have, you cant look at a place in one map without losing 30FPS and more (oh and btw, they know all of that)...

Right now, idk what you think about hirez, but most of the tribes players will agree with me when i say that they treated us like shit, and still do. Also do your research and be objective about the hirez/tribes thingy, yup, we are a weird community, but most of us started like nice people, trying hard to like hirez.

Tribes,30f31j,jamiemccomb,1 point,Mon Mar 30 05:47:58 2015 UTC,"So? Starting an ad campaign on something that is already dwindling in it's margins is a waste of money. If they had done that with either GA or TA both games would be in the same position they're in now anyway and Hi-Rez would have lost all that money on top of it.  They did SMITE right, tapped a market of casual consumers who EAT UP the gameplay they've spoon fed them all with old technology they already had ready to go and all without getting any new licenses and manpower.  And that was JUST STARTING SMITE.  Erez made the correct money making decision, which was fuck GA and fuck TA they're worthless. They'll never look back, they dont need to when they have money lining their mattresses."

Tribes,30blsv,Achus619,13,Thu Mar 26 01:10:54 2015 UTC,"I would love for that last thing (about notifying APC) to be possible. There are just those griefers who are actually skilled, yet are complete assholes, who probably turn away countless new players by their childish actions in novice servers.  It's unfortunate too that there is currently no great way for honest players to get their new friends accustomed to this game outside of joining their friends in novice servers."
Tribes,30blsv,GWej,8,Thu Mar 26 01:44:01 2015 UTC,"I might get an 8-35/30 server up, regular pub rules so new players can try what they like, and others can just play what they feel comfortable with. Still kinda doesn't excuse the fact that people won't just take the beating and get better by playing with people their own level, but games are meant to be enjoyed so who am I to tell people how to play"
Tribes,30blsv,MKRWSeek,2,Thu Mar 26 01:16:52 2015 UTC,"Still kinda doesn't excuse the fact that people won't just take the beating and get better by playing with people their own level, but games are meant to be enjoyed so who am I to tell people how to play.   While I do in general agree with this, I also think it was much easier for new players to start out when the game was new(er) and the player base was larger. I would argue that percentage wise there are currently more skilled players playing pubs than ever before. This means that if you're new or just not very good, your chances of finding a game where there aren't any players who are far more skillful than you are slim.  When I started playing the game 3 years ago, having no Tribes experience and relatively little arena shooter experience, the skill range of players I ran into was much more varied.  That said, I actually enjoy playing against people who are much better than me, since that way I can improve my own skills faster. But not everyone is like that. Most people either want a ""fair"" challenge against people of relatively equal skill level to their own, or they want to feel that they are awesome while killing a bunch of other players (which is why you get players who abuse newbies)."

Most of the skill just comes with time and thought for considering why something happened to you. Im not surprised there is people there, its too easy to abuse.  If you're a baddie its much more fun to be beating down on people than be getting it back I suppose"

Tribes,30blsv,vejket,3,Thu Mar 26 03:47:10 2015 UTC,"Ughhh... 25 fps is no excuse, I played at 20fps for 35 levels and was competent enough."
Tribes,30blsv,Obyeag,3,Thu Mar 26 05:30:34 2015 UTC,"1) This is Hirez Fault. There is NO REASON a Higher level player ever needs to join a Low level server. If you are high level and your friends are low level, they join you in the regular server (or an empty server or private server if you are teaching them the basics) and you play/learn together that way. It was just a bad design which we told them about but they never fixed.  2) I am pretty sure there are either 1-30 servers or 9-30 servers (cant remember which) but they never got used, not even when the game was full of life. The community itself divided into 1-8 or 9-50 only basically. If I am wrong maybe itsthe 30-50 servers I remember throwing me off.  3) People are dicks."
Tribes,30blsv,Mindflayr,2,Thu Mar 26 18:33:57 2015 UTC,"is there enough players to split the game in 3 kind of servers. I mean, if you create some lvl8-25 servers, we maybe may not be able to find 3 servers full each evening.  Yet, it's true that people in regular servers are today almost always lvl30 or higher."
Tribes,30blsv,Loxiasus,2,Thu Mar 26 09:06:20 2015 UTC,"Pretty much agreeing with what everyone's saying. My occupation allows me to meet dozens of new people, and I manage to introduce around five new players to T:A every week.  Due to that I spend around 90% of my time on 1-8 servers playing with those people to get them on a good start, telling the basics (I also recommend them to try pugs if they decide to stick to the game), and while doing that now for the past two years or so, I've been keeping track of the ratios of ""high"" levels, hackers, smurfs / new players on these servers.  As far as I've managed to summarise from the gathered data, there's still enough time on the servers for new players to play in peace for about a quarter of a day in-between the times when the higher leveled players log on and off, and the rest of the day is pretty much peak times when the larger groups of higher level players come on and the servers transition from playable to still playable, but pretty much a certain area around both bases turns into a non-survivable kill-zone, often resulting in a scorebard dominated by 0-0 kill-assists compared to the 5-10's filling the scoreboard on non high level peak-times.  However the ratios have been getting gradually worse as more players decide to come on these servers, something needs to be done."
Tribes,30blsv,Redwardas,3,Thu Mar 26 09:11:17 2015 UTC,If I start playing NAW/NAC again I'll consistently countertroll players in Novice TDM and CTF servers as well as teach Newbloods the basics.  I've always enjoyed helping new players.
Tribes,30blsv,prettzl,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:58:30 2015 UTC,"I thought novice servers didn't allow higher levels in. I selected one by accident once and it refused me entry. Are we talking about non-official servers?  I think your suggestion to add 8-25 servers is a good one, but it'll probably have to be done by the community.  Edit: I'd also like to suggest to the veterans, if you spot obviously newblood players on regular (1-50) servers, take it easy on them. Don't engage unless they engage you. And even then, maybe just damage them (""catch and release""). Avoid ground-pound/chain/hitscan. That's what I try to do. I know sometimes I kill a copper/silver rank player before even seeing their name, especially with reaction snap-shots, but I at least try not to. I'm sure you can imagine what it'd be like for a true newblood to play against our usual crowds. Makes it hard to grow the community.  *except smurfs. Fuck them all."

Tribes,30blsv,Lowerend,1 point,Thu Mar 26 17:20:01 2015 UTC,"I think 8-30 servers existed at one point, but after the playerbase started to decline there wasn't enough people playing to warrant keeping them, so it was cut down to just 1-8 and 8-50 or whatever it is now.  I still believe this to be the case, there is definitely not enough people playing to support splitting up what remains of the pub community even further, it's hard enough to find one or two semi-full pubs at what should be prime time.  There really is nothing that can be done which won't actually damage the game further, I do wish those shitters bullying the bronzies would come back to the 8-50 servers so I could bully them but this is a fault in HiRez's fuckawful code that allows them to join servers with much a lower level limit than their level is and not something that will ever be fixed (even though it's an extremely simple fix, at that)."
Tribes,30blsv,Nark51,1 point,Sun Mar 29 11:51:38 2015 UTC,"What if instead of adding a 3rd tier of server, we request that the novice services get extended from 1-30, and the regular 8-50 servers get bumped to 20-50?  I say 20-50 instead of 30-50, because by level 20 you can generally have at least one class down enough to at least try the big boy servers."

Offence - Kills the enemy defence to be sure his capper will be able to grab the enemy flag safely. This requires precise timing, if the offence clears the flag too early, the opponents will have the time to respawn and come back to defend their flag. 3 per team.  Sniper - His main role is to spot the incoming enemy capper and to kill the enemy offence. 1 per team.  LD(Sometimes called Roam or RoamD) - Defends his base, flag and teammates from the enemy O. 1 per team. (They fight 1v3 so they have to be good fraggers, even though they have the advantage of quick respawn that makes them back in the action ~10 sec after their death, while an Offence has to spend ~45 secs to come back to the enemy base.)  Hof(Heavy On Flag) - A Fatty with ""Super Heavy"" perk equipped, his role is to kill the incoming capper by standing directly on the flag and bodyblocking/killing the enemy capper when it comes to steal the flag. This job does not requires you to be a good fragger, but you need a good gamesense, as you will be forced to move away from the flag to avoid the enemy offence, but you also have to be on it (and alive) when the capper comes in.

Tribes,301oeb,prettzl,-6,Mon Mar 23 22:55:24 2015 UTC,Workshop? What for? It's called playing the game and offering help in PUBs.
Tribes,301oeb,MKRWSeek,15,Mon Mar 23 23:40:31 2015 UTC,I'll be honest here.  I think the only reason you haven't been banned from this subreddit is because your responses are so dumb it gives everyone a laugh.  Your opinions might actually be respected around here if you weren't contrarian just so you can feel like a victim.
Tribes,301oeb,prettzl,6,Tue Mar 24 00:04:44 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, prettzl's posts are pretty much the most entertaining thing left on this subreddit, in that ""I can't believe someone actually believes this shit"" sense."
Tribes,301oeb,Obyeag,-6,Tue Mar 24 06:11:49 2015 UTC,It's responses like these that give me good laughs.
Tribes,301oeb,prettzl,9,Tue Mar 24 00:12:07 2015 UTC,Sure.
Tribes,301oeb,Obyeag,7,Tue Mar 24 00:16:30 2015 UTC,"If you actually bothered to read my post you'd understand that these workshops are directed at people who want to try out pugs. Please, don't comment useless things like this. Nobody benefits and you'll just worsen your already awful reputation."
Tribes,301oeb,prettzl,5,Tue Mar 24 00:34:31 2015 UTC,"learning the PUG ruleset will only improve their pub ability. 7v7 promotes a lot more individual skill. There are no static turrets, 12 other defenders, etc. to back you up. The best situation you will realistically find yourself in is a 2v1, and rarely a 3v1.    How to move around and health/regen management.   Dueling is probably going to be a huge portion of the offense/LD sessions.   regen management is a moot point in non-honorfusor duels to begin with. In PUGs, waiting to regen is very rarely a good idea. That 15 seconds will kill an offensive run, and a defender can suicide and respawn back in position with fresh ammo before then.   Hitting near your target.   Poor phrasing, but I get what you're saying. groundpounds do have their place, but that's teaching bad habits. The most efficient damage comes from GP on the ground, chain in the air. Teach both at the same time.   Being observant and using vgs to communicate/using self spot.   Voices comms are infinitely better than VGS.   In my experience with various FPS games, ""Newblood"" in general doesn't mean new to the game as a whole. It's used to describe pubbies who want to break into the organized scene"
Tribes,301oeb,krokooc,5,Mon Mar 23 23:52:07 2015 UTC,"owow, this isn't even that shitposty, good job.  ""newbloods""(in this case) is referring to people who want to get into the pug scene but don't really know much about it and want to learn.  What this is not, is a introduction to the game in general. The game has been out for a couple years now, not knowing basic mechanics is not anything that you would need a workshop for."

Tribes,3004g9,Loxiasus,14,Mon Mar 23 12:56:23 2015 UTC,It's not THAT much harder to stop a cap with reach. It's everything else that makes the perk dumb. Sp get ready to put reach on 99% of your loadouts cos u have to run it.

In standoff/scramble scenarios, anyone without reach is a liability and dumbs down the art of flag passing to boot.

Come to think of it, I'd actually be really interested in seeing how the game plays out if the only perks allowed were ultra capacitors."

But in light of the fact that a vast majority of players suffer from bad ping/packet loss/etc the flag is much more likely to go through you on a pass that looks perfect (so much so that I've trained myself to aim an entire flag underneath its server projection WITH reach when my ping is irregular; which is a lot of the time) or not be picked up on a grab around a HoF where you seemingly touch a significant portion of it, if only for a split second.   inaccurate passes still just somehow get all the way home.    as in punting to the stand when you're halfway home? if you have an ld and a hof with half a brain they should catch it everytime. long passes don't have to be accurate as they give the catcher more than enough time to adjust   It looks like everyone's forgotten the retarded returns from behind your back if you're not running it   You mean getting conc'd from behind and the returner getting it even though you're ahead of them? I think this has more to do with the fact that there like a 2 sec delay between dropping the flag and being able to pick it back up again  edit: downvotes are cool, discussion is cooler. neither of the points he presented have any validity towards banning reach specifically. the only thing I can think of is HoFs are worried about having to do something other than sit on the flag for 25 mins"
Tribes,3004g9,scrambler_jumper,4,Mon Mar 23 16:02:12 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't stress out about downvotes.  I don't really agree that the returns from behind are related to the pickup delay. While that definitely does happen it's separate from what I'm talking about, which is if there's a cluster going, and someone without reach goes for a field pickup while someone with it swoops in from behind and gets the return despite the person initially trying to get it being physically closer. It did happen, people complained about it a lot.  In regards to inaccurate passes, again, you're taking one example where the effects of reach aren't really that impactful and pretending it's the only case. I'm talking about clusters where someone ends up tossing a flag slightly ahead of them willy nilly and someone comes in and picks it up from half a map away and suddenly that's happened 4 times in a row and the flag is all the way back home. Either that or the opposite happens where you make a sick pass and someone flies by and returns mid air from a mile away. Again, one of the main points brought up when it was initially banned, and considered valid by most active comp teams at the time."
Tribes,3004g9,xQer,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:14:50 2015 UTC,"Understood, but if that's the case then just ban all perks? You're saying that because a perk does what it's intended to do it should be banned?  And if you don't agree with that then why wouldn't you agree that reach should just be the default range for pickups so that everyone's on a level playing field and this isn't even a discussion in the first place? The default pickup range for flags is laughable in more instances than not (whether free floating or on stand), if this is due to lag or shitty code idk, but it's why I think it should just be the default value. No I haven't played years worth of comp but I guarantee I've experimented more with the flag than most tribes players.   Your second paragraph, as you wrote it, basically just assumes that no one has the skill to land midfield pickups and the only way they could possibly do it is by having reach equipped. If someone gets a midair return off a pass intended for someone else then there is something besides reach contributing to that.   I don't expect to change your opinion, I respect it and youre entitled to it, but competitive tribes (or whats left of it) is so stagnant in terms of flag movement and tactics compared to what it used to be that it's just a bore to watch and I don't see how banning reach contributes to regressing that.  In the end, I don't really fuckin care. I'm just a pub shitter and it has no effect on me."
Tribes,3004g9,LittleAscended,3,Mon Mar 23 18:42:35 2015 UTC,"I will say I don't like the idea of perks in general. A lot of them could do with just not existing or being base lined with tweaked effects. Straight up removing them all though wouldn't be great for tribes in its' current state I don't think, just because so many of them are integral to roles like capping, hofing, and just generally getting around the map quickly. I think removing them would leave us with some very clunky feeling loadouts. Maybe if the game was more alive with some dev support we could discuss some alternate perk system.  That said though, I don't really think the default pickup range is bad, actually. I'll admit most of my higher level tribes experience is limited to sniper and LD with a bit of capping thrown in at one point. Not exactly roles that see massive amount of flag play, so perhaps my opinion on the subject isn't the most interesting one. The flag play I do see though, feels very good to me (35-50 ping). With reach it feels like I can miss a pick up completely and still grab the flag, and that feels weird and shitty as far as I'm concerned.  With the midfield pickups all I'm saying is it makes the cluster plays a lot less precision based and bouncing the flag away from an incoming chase or someone trying to pick the flag up becomes harder and less predictable since you don't actually have to physically connect with the flag. Maybe I could have expressed that better above.  Regarding the midair thing, it's not super relevant, but I might as well say that the times I've had chase downs and somehow managed to get a mid air retrieve, reach or not, it's mostly been down to pure luck. The capper had to look the right way for the flag to come out at the right angle and I had to be at the right place at the exact right time. When both people are going like 300 that feels insanely hard to properly calculate. There is some skill involved in the chase and even having a chance at being there obviously, but nothing too huge. It seems to me that reach only increases the odds of those lucky returns. Like I said though, this isn't exactly the most relevant point, but it does contribute a little I feel.  I don't know one way or another about how stagnant it looks to a spectator, I personally enjoy watching it a lot and it feels quite exciting to me since there are a lot of nuances to comp games where both teams are actually trying (admittedly that doesn't exist anymore), but I understand it's not for everyone."
Tribes,3004g9,TimerClock14,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:52:10 2015 UTC,"Respectfully, I just have to agree to disagree with you on some of that.   But, one thing I think we can both agree on is that ping changes the dynamics of flag play (along with everything else) so much from player to player that it's really hard to find a compromise that makes everyone happy - obviously.    With reach it feels like I can miss a pick up completely and still grab the flag   If that were the case for everyone I wouldn't even be discussing it, but again this is something that alters from player to player based on ping. Seriously, go to a server with 80ish ping and toss the flag with a friend; you will literally see it go directly through you. That being said, I can completely see how your examples of cluster play and other scenarios could become frustrating.   Thank you for a well written, thoughtful discussion though and not the typical ""lol pub fag"" card. A rarity on this sub nowadays.   And I think, whatever happens, this game is too far gone to actually be able to 'fix' certain elements that were left broken. This being one of them."

Tribes,2zy4ju,zombieofthepast,3,Sun Mar 22 22:32:24 2015 UTC,"I don't really like colt being hold to fire, but I don't think it's any more overpowered than single click.  I only use colt inject (30 ping colt) when playing in America; if there were a version without hold to fire I would use that (I aim better with single click anyway), but seriosuly at that ping you're at such a huge disadvantage that it's ridiculous to call the hold to fire OP.  And at low pings, there's no difference between someone using magicchain for colt and using an ahk script, so there's not much you can do about it."

My point is just get over yourself and use it everywhere and be done. Stop pretending it matters if you only use it on high ping servers its an advantage to anyone on anything except maybe a listen server. And with the hold to fire modification that is only more obvious it is altering the parameters of the game.

More to the point completely different, a dll inject is modifying the code a game runs on and if you allow it and it can do almost anything it wants that is completely different than modifying variables in a text file that the game developers can choose to lock down or ignore. A game developer isn't going to be able to lock down what a dll inject can and cannot do. And we have now already seen people bringing magic chain replacements that are doing more and more and as said this same shit would be insta ban in any other game. But hey keep justifying it and making up excuses, the games abandoned no one cares which is why there are so many aim bots running around.

They're quite different unless you don't have the mental capacity to realize that a 4 ping player can out dps people using those allowed dll's.  The devs also locked down demo recording and net_stat to hide their own flaws (cheap servers+inability to code).  As someone who has developed games before I'd support anyone who tries to modify my engine for the better.

Tribes,2zy4ju,TimerClock14,5,Sun Mar 22 23:48:21 2015 UTC,Personally I hit more shots with the nova when I actually aim and fire each shot individually. I know a lot of ppl actually agree with me on this too (had this discussion before) so I don't think it's really that broke. Just my opinion though.
Tribes,2zy4ju,Sebaceous_Sebacious,6,Mon Mar 23 02:00:22 2015 UTC,"Personally I hit more shots with the nova when I actually aim and fire each shot individually.   You can maybe hit more if you take your time to adjust each of your shots, but thats way slower than actually holding your fire button hoping your shots connect.   Plus the high fire rate makes it so your target doesn't get to move as much between shots. This and the bouncing effect it has while your on the ground is really good for almost ""immobilizing"" your target, making it really easy to hit with more shots.  Imo it would've been fairest to have 12 ping fire rate without the actual hold to fire."
Tribes,2zy4ju,zombieofthepast,2,Mon Mar 23 03:51:34 2015 UTC,"I was among the better nova colt users, and I would aim and shoot 6 times individually per magazine, but I would do this as quickly as I could, ideally at the same max ROF that the gun would be firing at in hold-to-fire.  I trained myself to get faster playing a lot of Eagle Pistol soldier.  The fingernail of my index finger wore a hole in the paint of the left mouse buttons of two difference mice over the course of 18 months.  I'm lucky I didn't deform my nailbed."
Tribes,2zy4ju,TimerClock14,2,Sun Mar 29 00:47:04 2015 UTC,without the actual hold to fire.   ahk is a thing
Tribes,2zy4ju,PubFiction,1 point,Mon Mar 23 04:27:36 2015 UTC,"True however the bouncing only happens if the shot lands. With only 6 shots per clip you can't really afford to spray and pray with the colt because your next most reliable source of damage is going to be the disc and that could get you anywhere between 1250 and 0 damage. However if you're already able to land all 6 shots anyways,the bouncing people around is already mostly irrelevant because you've done a stupid amount of damage already (720 dmg at least, enough to cripple a light and a sizable amount of damage on any medium class) hold to fire and the stupid impulse that comes with ping are basically ""win more"" effects, all things considered. By that logic I stand by my original statement that I don't think it's broken."
Tribes,2zy4ju,Sebaceous_Sebacious,1 point,Mon Mar 23 04:35:42 2015 UTC,"You are missing the point other people will get better. No one holds burst fire on an auto and says well my accuracy is better, no even if it is better they train themselves to get better accuracy while holding down the button. Inject users will quickly adapt and treat the nova more like a auto where they track players down and the increased DPS will be apparent. With practice they will be hitting you with more average DPS then they could before and you will feel it."

Tribes,2zy4ju,Dodgesabre,3,Mon Mar 23 13:02:52 2015 UTC,"Ok, accuracy doesn't necessarily mean more dps, with same rate of fire it does. But I thought rate of fire was the discussed point here, so..."

The hold to fire only matters if you jet like a fkn nub or chain close range instead of exploding all over their face   From what I've noticed, it can also help landing more shots while on the ground. As I've said, faster firing rate + hold to fire, so just moving your mouse around, + the bouncing effect makes it a pain in the ass to duel.  Also, it's not just a minor change in the game, it adds something completely new: the ability to hold to fire in a weapon that was press to fire."

Being more effective on the ground only is true if you both spam instead of being careful with your shots.   It doesn't add the nockback and the fire rate doesn't matter to you does it? You have an issue with the colt not the hold to fire otherwise you would have thought ahk scripts were stupid before it even came out. If they are legal this is just as legal.   The reason to make it easier is so cunts like me (250 ping to central, 350 to eu) can compete when out aiming almost everyone.

Do you rest your whole hand on the mouse, using your arm to move it in relatively large movements like a caveman? Clicking is unlikely to disrupt your aim.  Like many, only my fingertips touch the mouse, I use relatively high sensitivity, and use more fingers than arm to aim with delicate physical movements.

About the ahk scripts, I've never heard anyone using it, especially now that there's magic chain that does the same plus more, but i might be wrong.  I know it helps people with high ping, what I'm saying is that it was a bad idea to add the auto-fire to mc. Having the 12 ping fire rate without actually hold to fire would be ok.Colt is supposed to be click to fire.

Tribes,2zz8ub,thisgameisverydead,6,Mon Mar 23 05:06:22 2015 UTC,"I would bet on the soldiers. Raiders are not good at all for stand D or chasing, and soldier is also a far better capper. I think pth is the only class that could give sld a good match in 7v7 classwarz, mobility is just too important in ctf."
Tribes,2zz8ub,WillMandella,3,Mon Mar 23 05:12:26 2015 UTC,"While soldier capping is almost always superior, raider capping is actually good enough to be a valid tactic in this matchup. Look at JP's comments below.  http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/2u8d0a/raider_routes/  Also I would consider not even running a defense if I had to run only raider. Just 7 man down the field and play for a stand off every time and try to play for caps off of winning standoffs. This makes up for the lack of a quality stand d and for having inferior capping."
Tribes,2zz8ub,Symtex123,6,Mon Mar 23 06:05:49 2015 UTC,"But.. that would let the other team play 6d and 1 capper, not sure if that would turn out too well"
Tribes,2zz8ub,sh4z,1 point,Mon Mar 23 12:22:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah it sucks, but how realistic is it for the raider to get the stop on a blazing capper + clear? What tools do you even use? And this isn't the most foreign concept, Vex has proven you can beat a D stack with an O stack, just not on this scale though."
Tribes,2zz8ub,Symtex123,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:45:22 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's pretty un-realistic that a squad of raiders would stop soldier clear and cappers. ergo I'd think raiders wouldn't really win the SLD vs RDR scenario.  The only benefit that I see of raider over soldier is their survivability on offense (esp not losing hp from sniper fire). But in straight up duels sld still beats raider, and for capping sld is still better in almost all cases (even if u are JP).  Still I do agree that an O stack would be a good choice if you had to play with these restrictions :o)"
Tribes,2zz8ub,sh4z,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:45:00 2015 UTC,"7 O would (always)in a perfect world with all things equal except strategy, beat 6D and 1 capper. This has been proven more than once."
Tribes,2zz8ub,duhlitz,2,Tue Mar 24 17:59:39 2015 UTC,"too bad the world aint perfect. tbh I'm not really sure what you're getting at here? why doesnt (didn't) everyone play 7 O then?  my logic reasoning: in best case scenario 7 O goes for standoff every time - which in an ""equal skill setting"" i'd count as a 50/50. But then you have to count in the times that the 6D manages to block a 7 O run, which I would say happens at absolute least 10% of the time (probably 50%). But even with only like a 10% or 1% chance of stopping the 7 O you'd be running the advantageous strategy.  I'm guessing you're thinking about chain-grabs / re-grabs. But with the knowledge of the enemy team running an O stack, regrabs should never come in unexpected and really, with 6 guys on D they shouldn't even be possible.."
Tribes,2zz8ub,sh4z,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:17:39 2015 UTC,"I just think it's a much harder feat for 6 people on defense to stop 7 potential grabs. If executed perfectly the defense will always be 1 man shy to stop the 7 potential grabs (which is how the offense should be running, not 6 o 1 cap or even 4 o 3 cap).   The real question is whether or not the 6 D can cap under non stop pressure from 7 coordinated players. They can, but staying calm under that sort of onslaught is beyond hard.   Either way I was never a fan of a 7 O stack in 7 on 7. 5 O 2 D is the perfect composition for an O stack in Tribes, and 4 D 3 O is the perfect D stack with all variables considered accounting for 'balance'. Too much D and you can't move the flag consistently enough to score, too much O and the other team can hard counter knowing to expect a stand off only match by executing chain grabs when they open up.  all imho of course."
Tribes,2zz8ub,duhlitz,2,Tue Mar 24 19:52:00 2015 UTC,"the Raiders might do ok on maps like dx or arx where they can slide, but the ability to actually groundpound and chase can not be underrated. Also in standoffs people go sld on d all the time because it gives great mobility and jets. The thing about all these theory craft arguments is the sld is proven in these roles and situations. When given the choice, people chose sld over rdr to get the job done."
Tribes,2zz8ub,WillMandella,0,Mon Mar 23 13:06:59 2015 UTC,"its funny raiders have 100 less hp than soldiers.  Their grenade jumps are extremely more difficult and require specialised routes in order to fit them in.  The self clear is the raider cappers best utility, but even that is not so much stronger than 2 xls and twinfuser.  And lastly the raider has the shield pack after the grab which he can rarely ever use in fear that he uses the energy he needs to have a speedy return route.  All in all I would say the raider is worse in every way compared to soldier capping.  However, raider slides/escorts through mid on maps like dx and arx work because you can use the shield pack even thou your slow."
Tribes,2zz8ub,pard0n99,3,Mon Mar 23 17:29:31 2015 UTC,"Don't listen to his lies. You can often use shield pack after grab to prevent kill snipes, as mstarr + 5 tao D will never forget. If you're good at energy management (seek, jp), you'll make it back with the same speed and can use the shield to block shots. Raider definitely has more survivability, but less burst clear. It's just different, not flat out worse."
Tribes,2zz8ub,Soninova,-1,Mon Mar 23 21:15:30 2015 UTC,yah ok soni keep grabbin at 230 so you can block exit snipes with your shield pack =) I can slide faster than that

Tribes,2zz8ub,pard0n99,1 point,Mon Mar 23 05:19:09 2015 UTC,"no groundpound, no boosting, long respawn time. There was a time when people could run multisnipe, and it was rare to ever have more than two. Theory craft is great, but look at actual game situations. Capping, chasing, standoffs, and getting stops on stand are the most important roles, and sld/pth will always be better at more of those than any other class."
Tribes,2zz8ub,WillMandella,1 point,Mon Mar 23 13:12:57 2015 UTC,"long respawn time sux.  I mean can the snipers use rage sap cuz it just gets more op.  I've seen snipers grenade jump and get flags out.  As far as 3 sniper dfence, cap would never make it to stand, then all the soldiers would die trying to grab the flag or escort.  And they would die to snipers from different directions and too far away to chain at.  Imagine a sniper going midfield on kata, and you can't start your route and you yell at your 3 soldier o to go kill him, so they try to go kill him and they all die b4 they get up to the  hill because of other snipers in position focus firing them.  Your whole team would be locked in a box by sniperfire and eventually a sniper running a route would grab your flag.  It would be difficult for the snipers to score but I think it would be impossible for the soldiers to get away from their base lol."

Tribes,2zz8ub,duhlitz,4,Tue Mar 24 19:55:46 2015 UTC,"Do the raiders get plasma gun?  Raider routes kinda suck and they would get gp on stand, where as the soldier routes are fast with xl/dual spin clear.  How does the raider gp the soldier cappers?  With no sniper you prob want one guy on a grav or shrike spotting cappers.  I really think the soldiers will win with more mobility.  You can disc jump or thumper jump which will be really important on crashes.  A raider crash will prob be pretty shitty/slower to respond.  Soldier capping I think is better/faster and soldier on stand has the better instant ground pound capabilities.  Give the raiders a plasma gun and it might be closer but you still can't crash with that thing.  Dueling is extremely important in ctf but mobility is also extremely important.  I think the speed at which you can move around the map is extremely important which is why pathfinder is so heavily used for crashing/chasing and escorting cappers/clustering.  Its more important to get there and have a chance at making a play than never arriving because you are in a slower class.  This is also one of the reasons I think shrike is op, its mobility is just unmatched (with a high hp pool) and you can get caps out with it.  If you don't think shrikes are op we should make them free in pugs and see how that changes things."

Tribes,2zv1w8,Fumz,1 point,Tue Mar 24 06:51:32 2015 UTC,"""Fixed"" means the servers crash at a far more infrequent rate. When they were crashing (presumably due to some hardware issue), they were crashing every 1-2 map changes. Now they generally stay up. Infrequent crashes do still happen in all server zones, and any other issues that didn't have to do with server stability still exist.  My ping is generally stable if I keep other people off my wifi, but your mileage may vary. Erratic pings generally tend to indicate backbone router or ISP issues if they aren't coming from local network activity, so it's probably out of HiRez's control (well, unless they decide to let people run their own servers).  Server locations did change at once point, I think. My ping dropped from ~95 ms down to ~60, so it was good for me, but probably not for everyone. I don't know exactly when that was. I want to say ~1.5 years ago? My memory is probably way off."

I lost count of the number of mtr and pingplotter traces I ran, but I was just fine right up to the data center; it was what happened beyond the edge servers that screwed me over. It was really strange. My pings inside the data center were triple and quadruple what they were getting to the data center, and that constant state of flux was just too exasperating. I don't know what exactly hirez did when they ""moved all their resources to smite"", but in terms of the game being playable and not, there was a clearly defined demarcation line starting dec 2012.

Tribes,2zvaxb,xaduha,6,Sun Mar 22 03:48:53 2015 UTC,"Inf tactics do not relate at all to the other classes. Sure you might get some good energy management out of it but your combat sense will be built entirely around going invisible for kills and cover. Its better to hone your abilities on map cover, visibility, vantage, approach, positioning, movement, and timing as it translates to all classes and more importantly opens you up to playing different roles as needed. So you can become a versatile credit to team who helps capture flags or a one trick pony."
Tribes,2zvaxb,prettzl,3,Sun Mar 22 05:02:18 2015 UTC,"I was a bit brief and tired and didn't explain further. But basically what morningwood said. Having stealth is such a crutch that many inexperienced players using to get pickoff kills. Really, you should be using a class to fulfill an objective or a class that goes toe-to-toe dueling. For new players, the default Soldier loadout is great for learning the mechanics of the game.  And people loathe being killed by infiltrators."
Tribes,2zvaxb,persuasionlaser,2,Sun Mar 22 14:28:23 2015 UTC,"I can agree about the long term, but you gotta ask yourself - what is your goal when it comes to games?  I had a lot of fun playing as INF 1, 2. Jackal is fine.  You're playing a different game from what the other classes play, that's all."
Tribes,2zvaxb,prettzl,2,Sun Mar 22 14:51:38 2015 UTC,I play to have fun. I also enjoy specializing during matches. My pth capper loadout is finished and I only need lar for chaser so that adds some flexibility. Thanks for the input.
Tribes,2zvaxb,Rynex,2,Sun Mar 22 16:45:37 2015 UTC,It always blows my mind to see such incredibly skewed class playtime distributions on Wilderzone profiles. Do you really enjoy INF so much more than other classes? How does it feel to have never gone fast as PTH? :p
Tribes,2zvaxb,MadWlad,2,Sun Mar 22 17:32:32 2015 UTC,"You know, that surprised me too. I played TF2 before that. Often MVP as any class, except maybe as a 'normal' Sniper, I played mostly KOTH though.  And in TF2 (KOTH mode especially) it pays to counter top players of the other team by switching to another class or loadout. But in T:A you don't have that, not really.  Most success I had at doing anything was as an INF. Yes, that includes capping."
Tribes,2zvaxb,prettzl,1 point,Sun Mar 22 18:05:07 2015 UTC,Ikr path is my second class behind inf
Tribes,2zvaxb,Shadowfax7337,0,Sun Mar 22 17:58:40 2015 UTC,Because it's not fun or satisfying to be killed by one.  Which is why I love playing INF.
Tribes,2zvaxb,prettzl,2,Sun Mar 22 07:24:16 2015 UTC,"Plain and simple, it's not the best primary for inf because of it's damage and mechanics.   Buuuuut, it can be fun to use for sure. Let's you be a giant dick to enemy players with smoke nades and knives.  You can sort of make a comparison between spinfusor and chain primaries. Spinfusors are fun, but chain is simply a better option. If you enjoy stickies, I would suggest playing with the raider.   Two sticky primaries- Arx buster and Dust devil Durable with shield pack or sneaky with jammer Chain secondary for consistent damage Emp-xl's have a retarded radius   What's not to love?"
Tribes,2zvaxb,Rynex,3,Sun Mar 22 09:12:29 2015 UTC,No reload airburst on single shots. :(
Tribes,2zvaxb,prettzl,1 point,Sun Mar 22 21:17:25 2015 UTC,It's a bad weapon because the masterminds of hirez's balancing division nerfed it so hard that it's become shit by comparison of the INF's other weapons.
Tribes,2zvaxb,Rynex,1 point,Sun Mar 22 18:26:28 2015 UTC,"You can make some air jumps with it + pot. energy..works better with shoot+reload script, but the force is to weak to use it as an propeller.. would be nice to have this kind things in new fps+z games ;D"
Tribes,2zvaxb,prettzl,-1,Tue Mar 24 18:03:49 2015 UTC,"It used to be good, at under 30 ping you can reliably air burst with it visually. Above 50 you're doing it absolutely by feel the visual information is mostly useless.  It would be my favorite weapon in the game if bandit damage weren't a thing.  It's one of the only weapons I know of that gives you a disadvantage against higher ping opponents."

Tribes,2zu7c7,WTFlub,6,Sat Mar 21 20:33:59 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for the feedback guys. I was cleaning out my hard drive and decided to put the clips I found into a quick montage. In the future I will definitely try to make a better montage."
Tribes,2zu7c7,Gaouchos,3,Sat Mar 21 22:56:56 2015 UTC,"We can't really say a lot of effort was put into editing, and I am not a big fan of repetitive music, but some pretty clips there.  If you do more of this, focus on finding good songs and syncing (At least a bit) (:"
Tribes,2zu7c7,Theheartattack,2,Sat Mar 21 22:52:53 2015 UTC,Some of the shots were alright and judging by the shot delay it looks like you have highish ping  pretty good for a pub montage  nice one m8
Tribes,2zu7c7,MKRWSeek,2,Sat Mar 21 23:41:09 2015 UTC,"I actually like montages having more laid back music like this, so that was cool. Sure the shots could have been better but I can tell you have 80-110 ping most of the time so that is still kinda impressive. Only thing I can say is pls no sap20+rage click dots ezpz w/ that combo"
Tribes,2zu7c7,ZtriDer,1 point,Sun Mar 22 02:02:54 2015 UTC,"Nice to see new videos being made :) Keep it up :)  A bit of feedback from my pov.  My biggest point is that the song choice did not work well, with me. The song has no good beat to sync the hits with, and the way that you made the video did not work well with the song. Pick a song wih more ""omph"" where you can sync the kills to. It enhances the effect of the hit that you are doing. And use more time to sync the hits wit the beat of the song. You where way too often off the beat.  IMO, I like to see a bit of ""history"" before the epic shot is being made, but not every shot. You have way to much ""deadtime"" in a clip before you do the shots too often, and many of them has no relevant effect or meaning to the shot. Shorten them down and have more hits in the video and only use ""longer"" clips now and then. The one at 2:34 gave me a laugh :p  Do not use too many groundpounds in a video. It simply is not wery interesting. I am all for a variety of clips and not just über longshot blueplate all the time. Showing more off what Tribes is about is also interesting to watch. Nice grabs, returns, melee's, curiosity happenings, just interesting things all belongs in a video.   And don't use SAP + range ;) There is a reason why it is banned in PuG's and Comp play. Good players will respect you less if you use it."

Tribes,2ztcaw,Lowerend,3,Sat Mar 21 17:50:57 2015 UTC,"I'd say the Soldier team would come out on top with access to a larger selection of 250+ routes, better mobility, and more versatile loadouts. A heavy BRT O push could keep SLD flag off stand but without the speed to get back into position its eventually going to cap as SLD capper rabbits waiting for the VBC."
Tribes,2ztcaw,THEM0RNlNGW00D,1 point,Sat Mar 21 17:04:16 2015 UTC,"Definitely this. Purely due to mobility the SLD team could make more plays for the flag throughout the match, which means more potential chances to get the flag out. Add to this the ability to get back on D faster and the BRT's wouldn't have a chance."

The soldier has been used at the highest level in every role except sniper. The brutes might be able to win with gimmicky play at lower levels where chain isn't as good and people can't run 250+ sld routes, but even then it assumes better aim and organization. I can think of a group of 7 that could pull it off vs a mediocre team with poor leadership,  might be fun to try to do in a pug sometime."

On Stonehenge its feasible because of the short walk back, but on a map like Kata or Raindance it would be a nightmare.

Then I took some drugs and drove another car it's like a Mitsubishi Eclipse special edition TYPE R or something beats me who cares when you own like 20 cars and three mansions and then I went to a stockholders meeting for Microsoft and Dupont and ExxonMobil and made lots of important decisions and then I took a limo with three hookers in it that the government paid for and they gave me blowjobs while I fingered their pussies and snorted coke off of their tits. And then I brought them home where my supermodel wife had sex with all of the hookers and I videotaped it and then we all did some online shopping and I bought a few more cars and a hot tub and we adopted some kids from the Tsunami because it is important to spread the love and be socially aware of things going on in the world, okay don't you think so? So then I drove the hookers home and they said that they had so much fun that they were not going to even charge the government and one of them said that I had the biggest cock she had ever seen and everyone else agreed LOL. So then I went and played some video games with my girlfriend and some of her supermodel friends and they invited some rock stars over and we all partied and played games and then all of the supermodels piled on top of me and we had incredibly erotic sex in one of my mansions and four of my other cars, all of which cost over $100,000 each. And also I totally owned at the video games. Then after that we went out for a restaurant and it was so good that I bought the restaurant and the head chef, who is also a supermodel, came out and gave me a blow job while she made unagi rolls which are my favorite. Then my wife and my girlfriend had lesbian sex in the restaurant and everyone had an orgy and everyone in the whole restaurant had a vote and I won ""Largest Wang"" as well as ""Best Eyes"" and ""Most Semen"". Then I drove home in 12 different cars and left the ones without gas on the side of the road for homeless people to take because it is important to give back to the community, and then I went to bed. And that was the best day of my life, for real."

Tribes,2zsqx0,fybix,8,Sun Mar 22 19:32:07 2015 UTC,"Tribes? Not just Ascend? Ok.  1999~2003 - I started playing in my parent's garage in Texas. Pretty sure I had broadband by this time and wasn't using NetZero's free dialup in which you had to delete a .dll file so the advertisement pop-up window wouldn't show on your desktop. I played a lot of base so I eventually joined a team called Team 187 but my heart belong to my UR mod team, nOn. We had a guy nickname Drive who worked for MCI. He was our server guy so we grew a little popular among the UR people if I remember correctly. We played a few TribalWar tournaments and some OGL (Online Gaming League?) and this other League that had gold and black as the color scheme for their website? I can't remember the name (WGL?). Didn't get too far, maybe top 10 but nothing groundbreaking. I dropped out of school sometime when T2 dropped (by this time I finally had gotten happy flag, magic chain and the 5150 voice pack working) but my friends and I didn't drink the kool-aid. We stuck to our UR mod and fancied Shifter every now and then (VFX too). Eventually I got my GED and went on to join the Marine Corps. Relocated to MCAS Yuma, Arizona.  2004~2006 - I believe the UR mod was dying out so I stuck to base servers but by this time I was gaming a lot more in Counter-Strike. Eventually the Marine Corps moved me to Okinawa, Japan and so the only servers I could play in where West Coast servers. I decided perhaps would be a good time to try out Vengeance and indulge in their storyline and single player game and it was good timing because I had gotten a girlfriend and orders to Iraq soon after. In the little time I did have in Iraq I would complete a mission/stage or two in Vengeance on my laptop I had bought at Best Buy the week before we left to Al Taqqadum. I'm certain I was able to finish it before I depart the war because I was stuck on rear party (last group of the unit to leave) so I had two weeks of downtime all alone with a few other Marines at the USO.  2006~2012 - Now back to Okinawa, I married my girlfriend, had a kid and reenlisted for another 4 years in the glorious Corps. Australia provided very few base servers so my gameplay was almost non-existent. I also had my laptop stolen so most of my scripts (god I miss my scripts) and files were lost. By this time though Tribes was a free download. I tried hard to get some local people into it. Talking about it's glory days and crowning achievements such as being the first online multiplayer FPS (or something to that tune) and how you actually needed teamwork to win. I still had a soft spot for Blastside (or the other ""side"" map). Of course no one wanted anything to do with the game and its aging graphics. It stayed installed but with little hope. I separated from the Marine Corps (honorably) and started working as a contractor for the Marine Corps. Also had another kid in 2010. By this time, my son was interested in online games, especially FPS.  2013~Now - Ascend is released. I have no idea of the backstory on how they got it and who hates who but I was happy to see a small momentum in the player base. Steam (https://steamcommunity.com/id/9LUNA)(1041 hours in Ascend, yay) was inline to pick the game up and I was a long time member of Steam since their Counter-Strike addition so felt good to have a community in place for it. I also found some Singapore servers to play in so ping wasn't terrible from my tiny island of which I have decided to call home. My son took up Ascend too and so it was more fun to show him how to play vice myself playing. The last time I played was in November last year. I play on a 2011 27"" iMac that is BootCamp with Windows 7 for Ascend and CSGO. The partition has very little room, 100gb, so I removed Ascend to make room for a ton of movies I was moving over to my tablet for back-up. I plan on installing it again today because my son asked about it. He has been busy with Super Smash Bros on his Wii U but felt the itch for some Ascend.  Shoutout to all my UR mod players who loved pressing 'B' to go fast and loved the sound of the AutoRifle. Shoutout to all the players who loved voicing ""I've Got the Enemy Flag, Heading Back to Our Base"" and right after that ""HELP!"" Shoutout to all the script kiddies who gave us sweet HUDs and skins.  Oh right, my achievement. Well, I'm about to be 31 years old and had a lot to be thankful for. Writing this, I'm reminded how I never got to live out my dream of becoming a pro gamer. I felt I was good in Tribes, Unreal and CS but it just never happened. I eventually stop caring about becoming pro and just wanted to be known but that hasn't happened either. I'm just a regular guy who plays online FPS and that will never change. And because of this, almost no one knows I still play FPS. My coworkers think I read books all day, my family thinks I work all day, my friends think I photograph all day and they are all right. I do all those things pretty much most of the day but when the sun goes down, the kids go to sleep, my wife reads her news app...I boot into Windows 7. I load up Ascend, or CSGO, or L4D2 and I shoot. So my achievement is, that after all the experiences I've been through, all the growing up I've done, I still love being a FPS gamer.  PS: Some dates and events might be a little out of order but that is the gist of it."

I never played Base as felt so slow but annilationLT and Elite renegades Base LT was amazing how much flag play came into the team play. Lots of this was lost in TA but we gained lots that T1 didn't have.

Tribes,2zoqne,mizzu704,11,Fri Mar 20 12:05:50 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I’ve never played the old titles competitively, and only played pugs in TA.  I think the overemphasis and search for “skill” as opposed to “depth” during game-related discussions in this community has lead to a mindset in people that favors strongly skill based, but really shallow and (in my opinion) boring gameplay, where combat and execution (in all departments, i.e. movement, spotting etc) are all that matters and decision making on a quantifiable level beyond the combat aspect is more or less irrelevant.   Assuming your post is even halfway serious, it is a stellar example of this attitude. In the old titles, there are complicated class, deployable, inventory, loadout, and base management systems in place that have huge implications for how a game turns out in the end and where decision making (which is inherently necessary to manage these systems) is much more important.   Comp T:A has had to strip most of these things out of itself to produce a game that is considered non-frustrating by its players (mostly thanks to hirez). And the result is a game    where there’s not a single ressource system apart from credits (which really don’t matter)* where you can make pretty much any strategy work if you have a team with the dmg output of seven Kennets  where, after like a half decade of existing, nobody has bothered to try to understand the sodding spawn system yet and where asking yourself why you lost a situation almost always comes down to ""my enemy hit his shots better than I did""   As a result, the only thing you, as a T:A player, look at when discussing T1 is its combat (which is a really boring topic IMO), when gameplay of the old titles have so much more things and depth to offer. Maybe. I do not actually know.  * also, full spawn for everyone, how retarded is that"

Tribes,2zoqne,perroTW,5,Fri Mar 20 21:01:38 2015 UTC,"This really is a great post and gets pretty much to the heart of the issue.  Ascend is just a boring and simplistic game.  It gets incredibly repetitive because it is just super simple to play compared to older tribes titles.  Just think of how simple it is vs the older titles:   spawn in loadout means the flag is the only true objective, instead of flag + base, tactics simplified as a result effective loadouts are highly limited due to slot limitations and poor balance. player choice and customization is limited health regeneration is automated, removing yet another player choice the horseshit maps all playing exactly the same, meaning the same handful of team compositions and tactics are used on literally every map on and on and on   The only people I know who enjoy ascend more enjoy it for one of 3 reasons: they never played the previous titles enough to understand and compare the depth, they have some form of autism that makes them really enjoy how every combat situation comes down to crunching dps numbers and optimizing stuff like mouse sensitivity, or they have some form of OCD where they latched onto something like rock bouncing or spotting and spawn sniping and just cant play a game without their preferred gimmick."

There are plenty of people who put a lot of time into each game and still prefer tribes 1, or at least agree it is still the most solid game.  Some of those people argue t2 classic beats it out for a few reasons.  Basically none of those people thing T:V or T:A are the best and can point to lots of reasons for it.  I actually think legions was the best game when it came to the actual movement/physics (downjet and overdrive were really neat), and a few things like the chaingun balance and flag play worked really well.  It had plenty of issues though and a pretty lame community in many ways.  There was never a very large group of good players, which really made the game boring for those who just ""got it"" right out of the gate.

Tribes,2zoqne,Billyb0i,6,Fri Mar 20 15:45:46 2015 UTC,"is this where you try to sound smart again about mechanics  why is it about luck if the same good players consistently have the same large margin of midairs over the worse players  why is it that when i duel people, i don't get midaired and I get 40+ a game  if you duel me do you think you will get many midairs at some point just purely out of luck?  you make no sense when you talk about luck fundamentally designed into them... there's absolutely no truth or sense in that at all... the ""luck fundamentally designed into midairs"" would just be going for super long shots like 80m+... but if you're talking about standard dueling midairs which are all pretty much 50 meters and less, it's all aim, prediction, and movement"
Tribes,2zoqne,rtcll,4,Fri Mar 20 16:00:45 2015 UTC,"you are stupid  there is a large element of luck inherently involved hitting an MA  when you shoot from a certain distance, even if you have aimbot-tier mechanics, you are still shooting a shot with the expectation that the enemy player will move in a fashion that you predict and have no control over.  It becomes more luck based the farther out the player is.  It's not entirely luck, but depending on a variety of factors, there is still a strong element of luck involved.  it's literally the same complaint people have about the huntsman in tf2 (the 'lucksman')  This is why the chaingun is both more favored and more skill-based than the disc for midair targets  why i bother explaining this to an idiot t1 player that has no understanding of game design, i don't know"
Tribes,2zoqne,Billyb0i,4,Fri Mar 20 16:07:33 2015 UTC,"I mean you can define it that way and call it luck or you can look at the amount of prediction involved that highly experienced players have learned to master. There might be a better way to put it.  I am glad you regard me as an idiot t1 player when I simply think the word luck can probably be replaced with a few different words.  I don't know what I could ever do to earn the respect of a kind, proven, and respected game developer like you"
Tribes,2zoqne,rtcll,9,Fri Mar 20 16:57:39 2015 UTC,"I mean you can define it that way and call it luck or you can look at the amount of prediction involved that highly experienced players have learned to master.   The two are not mutually exclusive.  Let's say a bad player has a 5% chance of hitting a shot, while a player with better prediction has a 20% chance of hitting the same shot. Pointing out that either is lucky to actually score a hit in that situation is in no way incompatible with the notion that having a higher probability to hit the shot means the player is better able  to predict the movement of the target."
Tribes,2zoqne,StorkSooFly,0,Fri Mar 20 18:08:34 2015 UTC,"Billyb0i, if you think that is how t1 midairs work, then you are gravely mistaken.  I know when I'm going to hit a midair. I don't say alright well there's a good chance my shot hits here, but maybe not. I nearly 99% of the time know when my midairs are going to hit. Tell me how that's luck? I am the best dueler left in Tribes 1, I was named the best player in NA in Tribes:Ascend. I can assure you I know what I'm talking about when I tell you that luck has not a god-damn-thing to do with hitting midairs in T1. But thanks for your input."
Tribes,2zoqne,AFireInAsa,3,Sat Mar 21 07:06:11 2015 UTC,"But that is indeed how midair hits work in any game in which the projectile has significant travel time, and the target has air-control. (Obviously this is true of groundshots as well, but the binary hit or miss nature of midairs makes their case more interesting.) You simply cannot know how the opponent is going to move, you can just take a guess, which some players are a lot better at than others.  The luck/chance/randomness/uncertainty of midairs is intrinsic in the sense that no player, however magnificent their game sense and aim mechanics, can ever hope to do what amounts to reading other people's minds with such consistency as to account for the opponent's ability to either consciously or unconsciously dodge the shot.  For example  Sure enough, in the above video I seemingly predicted how far the carrier might get before the disc reached that point, and managed to aim the disc in the general area. People often enough take that route back to the flag from the midfield. But the other side of the story is that I've gone for that very same shot likely hundreds of times, and it has hit just that once as far as I can remember. If he had turned left and seen the disc approaching from afar it would've been trivial to dodge. Or he might have depressed his jets button a second later and the shot would've missed. So many things outside of my control had to come out just right for that shot to hit that it would seem ridiculous to suggest that therefore I accurately predicted all of them, instead of having taken a guess and lucking out.  Now of course that is an extreme example, but the same principles inevitably come into play at shorter ranges as well, and only seize to matter once the target can only alter their trajectory less than half a hitbox-width in any given direction before the disc reaches them, at which point an aimbot could reach close to 100% accuracy. (This is probably slightly inaccurate, but the principle should be sound.)  As for your feeling that you can tell when you're going to hit, I would guess that looking at your actual gameplay would show that even though you might hit a good percentage of the shots you take, you still miss quite a few as well, which either means that you take shots you know with near certainty are going to miss (which would be a waste of time), or you don't actually 'know' the shot is going to hit as you fire it, but rather only a while after, in hindsight. I think that in many ways this mentality of understating the luck factor is a close cousin of other ideas prevalent in long lasting gaming communities, such as the idea of being 'one with the disc' or 'in tune with the way people dodge' or the idea that the way to see who is right is to have them duel, all of which could charitably be called voodoo.  TLDR: Anyone can look at demos of the best players in any game that has weapons like tribes disc or rocket launcher etc. and see that though most short range misses are due to insufficient aim, the further away the target is, the more likely it is that shots are missed because there is no way of knowing where to aim in the first place. When long range shots hit, it is always due to a combination of a gamble paying off, aim ability, and in many cases fortunate misaim."
Tribes,2zoqne,AFireInAsa,2,Sat Mar 21 13:46:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you wrote an essay to reiterate what I already explained.  I believe that the 'luck' factor of midairing really only is something worth mentioning in long range shots (45-50meters+ in T1). As someone who duels all the time, if they are under that range, and you know how to time your disc shot judging by the moment they make their first lateral movement in the air, you can nearly always hit with proper prediction and aim.  I don't know why you've decided to take such a strong stance behind this idea of luck in midairs, because as far as I'm concerned the disc in T1 is one of the most skilled weapons in FPS gaming. Trying to explain why midairs have ""intrinsic luck"" involved just seems really weird to me.   Moral of the story: Any long range projectile weapon hit in an FPS requires some degree of luck if the enemy knows it's coming and can move in any direction. The point that people aren't focusing on enough is that the closer range shots with the disc launcher can be hit with so much more certainty than you are led to believe. Aim and prediction is 99% of the game at closer range shots and I think it's ridiculous how strong you have tried to push this 'luck' factor.  If you want to see it empirically, I'd invite you to duel me and I would bet that you get midaired at least once every single duel."
Tribes,2zoqne,Symtex123,2,Sat Mar 21 19:35:27 2015 UTC,"Proj play t2. t2 disc is used for mine-disc and shooting the flag.

It's like saying that beating someone at chess has a lot of luck involved in it.  Which there is ... when you and your opponent both suck at it.  The factors out of your control are things you have to account for when using the disc.  Getting a MA is about out thinking your opponent and knowing what they're going to do before they do (which, believe it or not is a skill that can be developed), as opposed to keeping the crosshair over them with the mouse button held down.  So sure, there's some luck involved.  But how that luck factors in diminishes as the player skill increases.  Basically, people with no skill will get the occasional lucky MA.  People with high skill will consistently get MA's purely based on their skill."

I've played Ascend for almost 3 years now  and it's a way better game in every aspect.      exceptformodding  I have no idea how veterans can think otherwise, but it might be the fact that they transitioned directly from a game to the other expecting only graphical improvements and a faithful trasposition of every other element from the original game. And were let down every time.           I also can't fathom how anyone could think that chainguns with spread are better than Ascend's. The first is spray and pray, the latter requires actual skill.  This isn't meant as a serious thread but this drama is weaksauce and boils down to ""i like x"" ""no, fuck you. i like y."".

The chasing sucks and boils down to if you can hit an impact nitron or not, snipers are stupid and broken, capping is about as fun as running into a brick wall over and over, top level combat turns into adad strafe duels way too often, so many of the stupid guns are broken that competitive play has to ban them, you will see duels where people will literally start regenerating health in the middle of them, discjumps have no impulse, chainguns are stupid strong, midairs are way too hard to land with consistency, all of the maps are terrible, there's practically no other worthwhile objectives next to the flag, rock bouncing is stupid as balls though it is practically essential because of snipers being broken, there's way too many deployables that fuck over cappers (mines, claymores, forcefields), you need the coordination of a synchronized swim team to get the flag out against a good defense, the game pace is abysmal, vehicle combat is a joke, shrike vs shrike is the stupidest thing I've seen in a multiplayer game, the call of duty calldowns are fucking retarded, the grind to get the weapons you want is stupid, the perk system takes away a bunch of elements that should be in the game by default, the class system is restrictive and dumb, and there's so many stupid aspects of the physics I'll just lump it all together and say it's all horrible.  No doubt T1 and T2C have their problems, I don't see them through rose-tinted glasses like a lot of other Tribes players do, but they are totally and utterly superior to Tribes: Assend."
Tribes,2zoqne,StorkSooFly,3,Sat Mar 21 01:11:52 2015 UTC,"All of these things are accurate.  there are a lot of other problems with weapons as well. namely, the 18 different kinds of DLs. The armors were balanced before by having more weapons/utilities available to them and by being harder to kill. in TA they have all of that PLUS an enormous boost to their basic weapons.   I think a lot of T1 players can recognize a large number of improvements that came with TA. unfortunately, the gameplay of TA doesnt match it's visual appeal. TA looks pretty. There were some decent ideas. a couple of the maps had potential. but in the end, the physics, weaponry, and maps feel so restrictive that it's like having 4 adult men having a sleepover in a refrigerator box.  by that i mean it's really fucking gay"
Tribes,2zoqne,MKRWSeek,2,Mon Mar 23 21:40:57 2015 UTC,"I think this is the best, most comprehensive, list I have ever seen of TA's problems. Fix those things and you would have an amazing game. Smooth skiing and pretty art/graphics were the only things that stood out as improvements."
Tribes,2zoqne,mizzu704,2,Sat Mar 21 15:01:42 2015 UTC,Legions players know whats up.
Tribes,2zoqne,Schreq,2,Sun Mar 22 03:28:17 2015 UTC,"Nail on the head...  TA is ""prettier"" to some people.  I don't agree, and I actually LOVE how T1 looks with a few relatively old mods for skies and explosions.  The game is much brighter in general that most of it's sequels which I always liked.  There are lots of other basic visual aspects I enjoy more in t1, like it is easier to tell where things are in relation to terrain, you can actually tell where flags are in the air and how they will move, explosions actually render where they are supposed to when you hit an MA, the explosions actually ""feel"" powerful, etc.  All of this is moot though since you have to run minecraft ini to even play unless you have a top end computer.  A few things are better in TA when it comes to the rest of the game, but those things are all related to it being 15 years newer and a ""modern"" game.  TA didn't actually come up with any of the ""modern"" improvements, but they implemented them (often poorly) so I guess TA has an edge in a few places as a result.  Core gameplay though...not even close.  edit: o and you forgot some glaring issues with TA like no fog of war, banded damage, terrible huds, tons of horrid bandaids and crutches that end up causing more problems than they fix, etc"

Tribes,2zoqne,magnetswithweedinem,-6,Sat Mar 21 01:29:15 2015 UTC,"nope, wrong about everything  fun fact: t2 cg has more spread than t1, and it's still empirically the weapon with the greatest separation in skill between players  another fun fact: ascend was by far the worst tribes game.  Given how janky t1 and t2 are by modern standards, that's a pretty impressive achievement"

Tribes,2zoqne,Ethorei,5,Fri Mar 20 16:14:58 2015 UTC,i really don't feel like bringing up the same details and examples that have been brought up ad infinitum about why t1/t2 are vastly superior games to t;a. it's been done a million times   Has anybody really thought about these things and written stuff down? Where can one read up on that?   Crossing my fingers and hoping the answer isn’t tribalwar
Tribes,2zoqne,yeum,9,Fri Mar 20 21:25:06 2015 UTC,"The stuff which has the biggest impact on gameplay boils down to:   health regen instead of medkits ruins the capper vs chaser balance because regen means the longer your setup, the faster you go. You frontload speed a chaser can't reach. the small amount of impulse from disk jumps further amplifies the issue above and makes the game slower in general you can't really have naked spawns and invos tied to the gen when you have health regen because you can't bleed out the players raping your base/generator. Spawn locations is an issue as well. no fog limiting view distance makes snipers way more powerfull. lack of powerful and directional jets so hirez had to add air strafing/control which has 2 consequences: 1. players can dodge MAs for free without spending energy and 2. running proper cap routes probably becomes a bit more forgiving. only 2 weapon slots makes duelling less diverse. class system."
Tribes,2zoqne,Mindflayr,3,Sat Mar 21 01:11:08 2015 UTC,ok.
Tribes,2zoqne,CheezeCaek2,4,Fri Mar 20 21:24:46 2015 UTC,"T1 was better.  It came out earlier, and therefore i think it's unfair to compare it to TA. let's compare it to other games out around that period.   unreal  quake 2  half life 1  turok 2  T1 was the only game with such large maps.   Also while everyone brings it up...mods mods mods mods made it great. i really enjoyed the one where everyone had infinite ammo and super fast firing speeds.. shooting the sniper like a chaingun, or rushing a base with literally a wall of mortar explosions coming at the base before you, killing crazy amounts  or my fav, getting the interceptor pack and flying around running into people, then jump out, jump back in, interceptor at full hp! spent many a hour getting people pissed off and laughing at them.  Sure, you wanna say TA is better when viewed comparitively with just classic gameplay and no sense of time? Sure. But T1 had some fucking soul in it. It had more game modes then you could shake a stick at. It had maps that were suspended in air miles up. It had a damn good community, and you weren't worried about fucking unlocks. When you deprived someone of their generator, it hurt."

Health regen,  2 weapon loadouts, nade jump instead of disc, these were all clear cut ideas that we needed in a tribes game. It's a wonder why the t1 and T2 vets stopped playing this game and why t:a will die before t1 and T2 will. shrug"
Tribes,2zoqne,DeadInAFlash22,4,Fri Mar 20 15:52:59 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree with you that T:A was really well thought out and designed, and I was prepared to embrace T:A as the successor back when HiRez was actively working on it.

Tribes,2zoqne,yeum,2,Fri Mar 20 23:30:24 2015 UTC,"To actually give an honest response rather than just being snarky: I think they're fundementally different games, at least if we're comparing T:A to T1 base.  They encourage different styles of play, and I don't think either is 'objectively' bad. However, the style of T1 really doesn't interest me at all, where T:A does."
Tribes,2zoqne,MKRWSeek,2,Sat Mar 21 02:11:32 2015 UTC,"CG having a huge cone of fire makes it require more skill to use and not less.  Why do you think we all started doing the thing where you move your mouse in circles to try to get the T2 CG bullets to all come out in a smaller cone?  TA auto is literally just point and click, there's so much less skill."
Tribes,2zoqne,phatalphreak,2,Sat Mar 21 04:02:42 2015 UTC,"I mean T1 is from goddamn 1998... 19 ninety fucking 8.  That was 17 years ago.  It is outdated.  Parts of T1 are better than T:A and parts of T:A are better than T1 and anyone who says otherwise is not being fair.    I played T1 when it first came out and it blew my goddamn mind.  T:A didn't have quite the wow factor since it was a rehash but it took ideas from good roots and made them modern and enjoyable.   Unfortunately, the business model and some of the design choices were not for the better and we were unfortunately left with neither an inferior nor superior alternative to the original tribes.  I can understand enjoying one version over the other but to call one superior over the other is silly.  It's subjective.  Gun to my head I think t1 has elements that are way more fun than T:A but I still enjoy playing T:A more.  I could write an essay on why but it's just not worth it.  Tribes fans are tribes fans.  Who gives a flying fuck what version they prefer or hate.  We still love the same core mechanics and franchise."

Tribes,2zoqne,Luka666,1 point,Fri Mar 20 23:34:36 2015 UTC,"If both came out at the same time then T:A would be more successful... but comparing them both based on when they were released then T1 wins by long, long way.  The number of people who have played all the tribes games and think T:A was the best of the lot are few and far between.  T:A is no-frills tribes. Some people like the fact it works better with smaller teams and a higher focus on sniping and chainguns... but most of the oldies prefer a bit more variation...  Turret monkeys that had a huge impact on games Generators that were actually worth attacking & defending Balanced vehicles Balanced weapons! The CG spread was a great thing as it made other weapons more valuable.   I still enjoyed T:A but it was very vanilla compared to what I was expecting of a Tribes game."

It had a TON of problems after launch because of the really incredibly bad patching...but the game itself was great.  Once it was stabilized through patches and mods it was awesome.  I still think it had the best mix of speed, maps and tactics.  Tribes Ascend is awesome in a lot of ways but I do miss the bigger maps and larger player counts.  Playing in a 32x32 was awesome because it was like a real war.  You had squads and you'd assault in groups and hold territory, etc.    Your goal was usually to assault the base in force, control the generator room long enough to bring down any forcefields and draw defenders from the flag.  THEN someone came in for a capping run."

Voting doesn't work on a subreddit this small (yes, it's small).  The only thing that can combat that kind of spam is if more 'quality' content were to be submitted an upvoted, which really isn't happening these days.  Mumble drama, boring route videos and ini requests aren't any better than videos of T1, and are arguably worse content.

Tribes,2zmo1f,AvianIsTheTerm,8,Fri Mar 20 02:21:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  I was going to post a T1 vid today actually until this stuff popped up.  A T1 player from back in the day has recently started recording commentary over old demos of 5150 and other teams, and is actually interesting, at least to me.  https://www.youtube.com/user/gmacdonalddc/videos"
Tribes,2zmo1f,evanvolm,1 point,Fri Mar 20 02:27:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I recognize that the content won't be hidden, since posts are few and far between, but to anyone casually browsing (or seeing /r/tribes on the frontpage via subscription), it should be down far enough to not annoy too badly. It's not like the content is actually rulebreaking (even with prior rules), just boring."

Tribes,2zmo1f,AvianIsTheTerm,0,Fri Mar 20 09:04:45 2015 UTC,maybe years of playing the same game caused it or maybe they're all old causing them to be really grumpy idk
Tribes,2zmo1f,angrypolak1,-7,Thu Mar 19 22:44:40 2015 UTC,has anyone noticed the correlation to being a T:A player and obviously being a no-talent ass clown?  T:A is unarguably the easiest and most asperg of the entire fucking series.   anyone with half a brain that was born before 1998 recognizes the '69 shelby cobra that T1 is versus the mitsubishi that is T:A

Tribes,2zmo1f,Netsky200n,1 point,Fri Mar 20 09:51:19 2015 UTC,T1 players were a tough bunch. If new players didn't leave due to the massive learning curve they were verbally attacked and admin abused pretty much until they did. Tbh I thought it was mostly how Americans were to each other.   Not mentioning any names but one well known TA player/T1 vet smurfed asking for help to set up a server only to send a file to the guy who offered to help that when opened formatted his whole pc which he could do nothing about.   Over all they can be a very hateful bunch even to each other.

This focuses the game on very few interactions and marginalizes support roles.  The faster the pace of the game, the more it punishes actions that do not DIRECTLY interact with win conditions.  This is a HUGE point of contention in the community, with some people drawn to Tribes for the diverse team based aspect, and some drawn to it for the fast paced frenetic twitch aspect. These two play considerations can be at odds with each other."

Tribes,2zq4t4,qhp,1 point,Fri Mar 20 23:04:35 2015 UTC,A lot of the mid field healing etc slows the overall speed of game down which speed is what makes Tribes fun.   Unless you have some pug level sniper then one or two offence should be able to clear a stand in a pub for a decent capper to get out.
Tribes,2zq4t4,vejket,-2,Fri Mar 20 18:35:36 2015 UTC,"So I'm trying to repair the ADHD nature of tribes and you're saying that's what makes it fun? That was certainly true for disc-only arena, it was frenetic and I loved it, but I wouldn't mind a slower game with more self-made storylines in standard CTF matches. I just remember in Tribes 2 I had a lot more ""and this one time..."" stories. In T:A it always seems to play out the same way."
Tribes,2zq4t4,mizzu704,0,Fri Mar 20 18:46:43 2015 UTC,"Not at all, many like myself prefer a slower paced game that has a wider ecosystem to play and contribute in.  However, the more the team based aspects of the game are emphasized the less discrete influence a single individual can have with his own skill. Some prefer to emphasize rewarding individual skill above all other aspects of the game.   A game that rewards ten people displaying modest skill in unison over one person displaying GREAT skill by himself will naturally be less interesting to the greatly skilled player."

But seeing as you don't even use magic chain, this is pretty odd.    My ping has also been relatively high lately, about up 20ping to all servers, but it's still stable.  It's just really hard to pinpoint the problem, could be the tribes servers, could be your particular routing to the servers, could be an update to your OS changed some API that tribes uses and it's messing with the game (this is just an off tangent theory because some injects cause this for people and some injects completely crash their game while they work for most people), it could be your hardware like MKRWSeek pointed out.  What I'd like to see is someone using a network tool of some kind and seeing if there's spikes in ping/lag to the server while they play.

Tribes,2zct7x,DarcseeD,5,Tue Mar 17 17:52:32 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but this is just poor advice. How is this the top voted comment? I'm going to piggyback this comment and hopefully provide some actual help.   First, ask yourself why are you getting angry at people. It's probably for a really fucking stupid reason.   Yes, identifying the true core reasons of your anger is a good starting point, but telling yourself that ""it's fucking stupid that I'm angry"" is definitely not. That is most likely to increase the feeling of anger, as the person will get more angry at themselves for behaving in a stupid manner, or place even more blame on others for ""forcing"" them to act stupidly.  One popular school of thought is that people don't just get angry because something that they perceive as bad happens, but because of an irrational view of reality, themselves and others. I suggest you read up about REBT or rational emotive behavior therapy. Seriously, read it, especially the ""Theoretical assumptions"" subsection.  Applying this specifically to your anger towards other players in video games, you should figure out if your expectations of other players and yourself are rational and work on turning the unhelpful feelings (""my team sucks!"", ""I'm not good enough to win with this shit team"", etc) into constructive ones (""how can I help my team play better"", ""what can we learn from this poor performance"", etc).   People go out their way to expose weaknesses of others. The moment you are pissed off at someone, they've basically won a huge advantage over you AND your team. Why your team? Well, they have to deal with you acting like a vapid cunt for 30 minutes, while they just sit and chill from the side lines.   While true, it's again not helpful to simply acknowledge that you getting angry is helping the opposing team win. That way of thinking serves to further enforce the disappointment one feels in their teammates, since in their eyes, the teammates are to blame for making them feel angry.  Instead of thinking ""my teammate is bad because they made the wrong call"", think ""they may not have had all the information I had, they did the best they could"". Try to replace unconstructive thoughts like ""my teammates must play better if we want to win"" with more constructive ones such as ""what can I do, or we as a team do, to perform better"".  There's often not even a right answer to those more constructive questions, which itself can be a source of frustration, but at least you're attempting to use your brain for something other than simply being angry.   Seriously, stop being angry. Especially at the internet. ESPECIALLY AT VIDEOGAMES. The whole point you're playing a videogame in the first place is to chill while attempting something intellectually and mentally stimulating, but if you're getting frustrated at videogames... then perhaps you shouldn't be playing them. Go outside or read a book or something.   This is the worst answer yet and frankly what prompted me to make this post. The ""it's just a game"" argument is so useless and counterproductive that I'm honestly surprised how many people still use it.  Being emotionally invested in a game, or any activity, is not bad or wrong. Telling yourself that you are somehow in the wrong for getting emotional about something you enjoy doing is actually harmful and serves only to increase the feelings of frustration towards yourself and resentment of others who partake in said activity.  It's perfectly fine to feel angry when playing a game, especially when competing with others. What matters is how one deals with that feeling, that they figure out the true reasons for their anger and find ways of using those feelings in a constructive manner.  PS! I'm obviously not a professional psychologist, so all of this should be taken with a grain of salt. If you truly have anger issues and are unable to work through them yourself, I suggest consulting a psychologist."

Frustrating situations come about often, where it feels like you're getting shit on because other people aren't doing enough. How you react sets the tone for the rest of the pug. Try to talk to your teammates about why you're not succeeding, what the problem is, how to solve it.   Focusing your efforts as a team will likely result in a much better game for everyone. As long as everyone is staying focused and trying to play well it should be a good game.

Everybody is going to tell you to just not get mad because, ""is only game, why you heff to be mad?"", but I know it isn't that simple. Team based games or any game with some sort of reliance on others can be very frustrating.  I personally began to channel my frustration into my work, because you can't get mad when you're the one stomping fools into oblivion right? I also began to question my anger as to why I kept getting mad and from there I realized how pathetic I was becoming and slowly began to stop getting so mad. It takes time to go from being toxic to not, and it is hard, believe me.  The bottom line of it still being a video game and while there is definite reason to get angry, whether it is cheap mechanics, or idiots fucking you over, when you walk away, you need to walk away from the anger too."

Tribes,2ywl8n,TimerClock14,7,Fri Mar 13 16:43:55 2015 UTC,What an effort - thank you. My only feedback for a possible #2 is:  Feature yourself for the effort in the prologue and in the credits - but show - while the montage is running - the names of the protagonists so that old men like me don't have the hassle reading at the bottom left who did show off that move. Thanks!
Tribes,2ywl8n,Pumpelchce,3,Fri Mar 13 17:51:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I feel like the names of the editors could have even been youtube annotations so if you want the information it's available but can be turned off. Got a little distracting having text in the top left the whole time."

Tribes,2ywl8n,Myst3r1on,2,Fri Mar 13 13:55:49 2015 UTC,"I had considered it, however it was a bit of a pain in the arse because every clip is a different player and they're short shots usually. You barely have time to notice the shot after registering the player name or vice-versa. I think this allows you to focus on the shots, and if you are desperate to see them you can always look at the kill feed."

There also is the -MAXQUALITYMODE command-line switch:   MAXQUALITYMODE - Forcibly overrides certain system settings to their highest quality regardless of performance impact.   Not sure if it actually has an effect and I was too lazy to compare screens with it on and off. Also look into the tiledshot console command. It basically lets you take screenshots in a higher resolution than you are running the game at. If you take ridiculously high res screens, and scale them down later, aliasing will be less of an issue.  Check out my  video. I used all of the stuff I described above to make it."

Tribes,2yxql4,jwapplephobia,0,Fri Mar 13 22:38:12 2015 UTC,"Titanfall did alright before dropping though, not dead on release. As far as Tribes though, I kind of agree - it was the guillotine that killed us outright. The numbers were pretty damn good comparatively though the money might not have been for HR. Lots of people have bragged about ""I never gave a dime to Hi-Rez"" and I would wager that's true. As Todd recently said, a $20 price point for entry with no fishing-for-dollars mechanic would have been so much better. I think I'd rather play with people who would sacrifice some money to play anyway; they'd take it seriously and try harder to pry the value out of the product. Ah well."
Tribes,2yxql4,Abe_Odd,1 point,Fri Mar 13 22:54:31 2015 UTC,"I personally enjoyed the grinding to unlock system. I paid $30 close to the onset because I enjoyed the game. I never used any boosters, and made heavy use of the deal of the day to unlock everything and had a great time doing it. I would not have enjoyed the experience as much as simply paying $20 and having everything.     What I believe killed it was the lack of community modding support. Hirez didn't have faith in letting the players decide what and how they want to play. There are tons of fans who would have churned out new maps for free, and with iterative testing refined the existing ones to perfection.    They also failed to monetize cosmetics effectively. The community was almost begging at times for custom contrail jetpack colors, custom vehicle and weapon skins, etc. Instead they made a number of player models that cost way too much.    They spent too much time and money modeling maps which they released for free ( and then people hated ) and player models which no one wanted to buy for $10.  Perhaps they could have had VIP servers, where only paying members could access. That would have alienated newer, less invested players, but could have incentivized the common player to ante up."
Tribes,2yxql4,Moriella,1 point,Tue Mar 17 18:07:51 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't make much sense to have a wall-walking mechanic in Tribes since the movement is already fundamentally different and it would be very hard to produce decent maps that work well with both that and skiing. There are already ways to produce movement in the way you're suggesting in the second paragraph. Surfing with ""voxel terrain deformation"" sounds cool at first, but also like a nightmare for performance and gameplay. Would be cool to see though. What was this thread about again? How did I even get here?!"
Tribes,2yxql4,MKRWSeek,0,Fri Mar 13 19:07:29 2015 UTC,"Hehe. Yeah sorry, I'm slightly ADHD and I have a load of ideas that are often rejected by Tribes players, which delights me for some reason.   // Point 1. I think it is T:A's crappy jets that DO make wall walking/hanging necessary. Any time you can hang and let your energy recharge is a blessing. Ever tried to climb up onto a high base wall as fatty? God, it's miserable. It seems like the longest wait in the world for the energy to recharge and if you try too early and can't make it over the lip you fall back down and have to wait even longer. It certainly doesn't make one feel heroic. We can use jets for limited hops, but we aren't birds by any stretch -- wall walking dynamics and bases that utilize more of the height dimension would certainly go hand in hand. Jet... cling... jet. Always moving.  // With the voxel terrains changes I've seen in Space Engineers and Medieval Engineers I'm not so sure it would be such a huge hit on performance. It would be neat as hell. Even 'skiing' where the ground was like snow and you left a sort of ski wake that someone else could ramp over -- with the terrain very slowly removing the dead bodies and settling the carved ice back to landscape equilibrium. Neat stuff."

Tribes,2yuz6m,jihad4jesus69,7,Fri Mar 13 01:02:27 2015 UTC,"and more so that dynamix was scheduled for the chopping block years before t2 was even released due to the corporate buyout of seirra and change in management  which as dave g aka qix has explained it basically came down to a choice between seirra management of ""use dynamix as a scape goat or face losing our own jobs"" so what option do you think they picked?  this article is poorly researched"

Tribes,2yuz6m,senitelfriend,3,Sat Mar 14 00:23:49 2015 UTC,"Let me translate some of this.   The concept was for an MMOG called Tribes Universe, which would be similar to Global Agenda in scope. Hi-Rez’s development had always prioritised early playability and regular iteration, however, and this – as well as seeing the weaknesses in Global Agenda’s structure – led to a different direction.   We already knew, but forgot, but then remembered, that we actually had no idea how to make an MMOG.   “Our project management philosophy is not that complicated,” Harris tells us. “We build the game every single day, we work to have it playable every day, and then we play it every day.”    We had no experience in planning things so we made stuff and then observed what came of it. Somehow this cost 20 million.   In Tribes’ case, this produced a multiplayer shooter where both the combat and the series’ unusual movement mechanics were working early in the process. Seeing the strength in these principles, Hi-Rez refactored Tribes Universe as Tribes: Ascend, a free-to-play competitive shooter.   Unreal engine had a make FPS wizard, so we started from that, added skiing by absolutely butchering anything related to physics or demo recording, and left it at that.   Ascend scored well with critics for its smart refinement of Tribes’ formula.    By ""smart"" we mean ""dumbed down"", and by refinement, we mean ""unreal engine came with nicer graphics""."
Tribes,2yuz6m,Algerus,2,Sat Mar 14 21:17:16 2015 UTC,"Our one regret is that there’s an expectation of ongoing updates with a free-to-play game, and we haven’t done that.

Conceptually, the game is easily expandable in many directions and game types but my guess is they made a house of cards and can't build on it, so they abandoned it.   Tribes has never had a company think of it this way, as a growing and expandable experience, but the community did, and where it could, mods and maps were born.   HiRez has shown us that this will never happen with the franchise under their thumb, they don't understand the passion of the community or the social and synergistic elements involved. They don't understand the importance, of the importance of support roles and how it plays into matchmaking and training, which ultimately builds into competition. They don't understand teams grow from loving the game not building as if it should be an esport day 1 (whitelists lol really!). That esports have to come organically to truly be Tribes.

It may have been because my son always had us play TDM, I think it was called domination. The game didn't make sense, as many games today don't from a skill level perspective. When you start you get weak and almost useless weapons and as you play you get the toys and the experience and it becomes just stupid. PS2 is like that too but to a slightly lessor degree. Ascend, arguably fell into this anti-noob grind, but at least some configurations available like the SLD were pretty formidable out of the gate....but yeah, I like the idea of wall running, but skiing is king! And in my opinion, Ascend was the first Tribes that seemed to make it more accessible and natural in the game, perhaps too accessible for heavy armor even IMO."
Tribes,2yrwzz,socalpk,1 point,Sat Mar 14 15:32:12 2015 UTC,"The last Battlefield I played was 2. I've been told that 4 is pretty good and may mess with it sometime soon. I play Planetside 2 from time to time with my son and we have a good time, but nothing like I have with Tribes. Ascend does have some good qualities in it's own right, but it just feels like a solo game to me. There are very few direct coop strategies. Although I did really like the recent grave bike montage. Ascend is hard to make friends in. The pace leaves no time to interact other than to shoot each other. I remember being able to have actual conversations with players between waves of attack in T1 and 2. I remember ""feeling"" the balance of the match change based on the waves. Ascend feels intense all the time and attitudes seem to match the intensity and not in a good way. There just is no feel of balance at least to me.  Part of the beauty for defense was how intense the interactions could be, a sudden wave of battle then the calm...the calm before the storm. And on offense, how important the element of surprise was and changing up tactics to exploit weaknesses to be more effective. Ascend take less thought and more direct confrontation, the waves are there but they are individuals spawning and then independently attacking, often you can predict the time it will take the same players to arrive and you already know what they are going to do....I really miss feeling that balance change that Tribes had, people adjusted their positions based on them and again you'd feel tha balance change again. I miss that."

It's hard when there's not much out there yet on a game like Project Z, but I can tell you that the game has been better than T:A since the conceptional stages before development even began. That's when T:A failed, in the board meetings when they were imagining the game. Not when during beta, after release, or when they stopped updating it."

(also I've never seen any detailed comparison on the physics of T1 vs T:A so please link I'd like to see it)  T2 by most accounts was the worst tribes ever made and the farthest from the original tribes play style; summed up it was slower with more reliance on vehicles.  One could argue Tribes: Vengeance was the closest, but I think it comes down to preference in most cases.  But of course most of this is 'opinion' and none of these games are 'objectively' worse as we'd have to agree on a set of parameters that makes 'a good tribes game'"

Tribes,2yu1cc,TheBunnzzy,5,Thu Mar 12 20:30:22 2015 UTC,"There's a few things that you can practice on. Probably #1 would be timing. Sounds simple enough but it's a very prevalent concept in organized gameplay. Depending on the strength of a defense, you may find yourself dying early and not providing good clear for your capper. For something like that you want to go in a couple seconds later than you were before, so hopefully you can land a bunch of AoE damage as the HoF or ld remain pretty static in anticipation of your capper arriving soon.   Another example would be when to kill the snipe, often the biggest threat. Really good snipers are going to have to be killed multiple times in a run, and being able to engage a sniper at the appropriate time is exceedingly valuable.   How you arrive at the enemy base is pretty important too. A primary function of the offense is to spot enemy cappers for the defense. So what you want to try to do is flank around the sides of a map and keep looking around for whoever the capper is, just make sure you make it in time to clear. It takes some practice to understand how fast you can get to the other side but it's a great help to the defense knowing what side the capper is on or which side he isn't.   There's some more things but hopefully this helps some."

Some things are banned in Eu and unbanned in NA. Currently, in Eu, sap20, turret, plasma gun, mines, fractals are banned. You can't use reach perk and the stealth pack. You're allowed to use only one forcefield at the same time. Team can only have one sniper.   You're welcome. It's always nice to have some new bloods. :) People will teach you some things in game and you probably won't play roamD at your first PUG, cause it requires a good map awareness and killingpower."

Lazy unbanned him but don't think he's going to be back.   Basically, there was a huge skill deficit between him and other players, even though he's played for a long time, so it was really hard to balance teams.   I feel kinda bad but it was getting to the point where people would just quit because they're salty that he's on their team and it would kill pugs.   Wasn't something that was addressed properly when it started being a problem so because of peoples bad attitudes something had to give.   Need tribes bootcamp plz"

Tribes,2yqf7k,DortmunderJungs,1 point,Thu Mar 12 00:16:45 2015 UTC,It is quite consistent if you know about where to hit it. You can actually hit it toward the bottom if you are on Blood Eagle to come towards the flag from an interesting direction.
Tribes,2yqf7k,sh4z,1 point,Thu Mar 12 00:26:50 2015 UTC,There's literally no reason to disc off the stand. You have a significantly cleaner and faster exit if you maintain energy and have >0 vertical movement and jet off the hill.
Tribes,2yqf7k,Wengatang69,1 point,Thu Mar 12 03:15:37 2015 UTC,"I know, but it is flashy :) You can take the last bounce low before you grab for more energy and less visibility too, but it just looks cooler this way.

Tribes,2ynuju,Will12239,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:19:48 2015 UTC,Other classes riding might be more hype but with 0% inheritance good luck doing anything effective without hitscan (sniper) or chainguns (which are not hype).

To be honest, this montage barely scratches the surface. I have so much more footage to sift through still, since I was only looking for clips with GWej. Hopefully I'll actually keep at it and produce a few more before nuking the ~1.5TB of footage still left."

My one suggestion is when you have the dual screen just to have one person's view then the other view next instead of split screen. I find that the split makes it hard to focus on what is going on and I'm always feel like I have to re watch the section to fully understand how awesome the shot was. Overall awesome montage and I would love to see more!! :D

If it's shitty trolling and he's just getting downvoted no matter what he says then he would have an easy excuse to back out and not answer any questions.  Instead, ask hard questions that are rooted in fact.  Both him and his company have fucked up enough times that there is plenty of evidence lying around.    If you troll, he can ignore you and even possibly cancel the AMA.  If you ask real questions that are rooted in fact, he can still ignore them, but it's a small subreddit so it will be obvious that he is dodging real questions for the sake of them being too hard to answer."

Tribes,2ynlwy,duhlitz,1 point,Wed Mar 11 14:14:57 2015 UTC,"Heh, after a show I once got yelled at for ""asking tough questions"" to Bart during an early Tribescast I did.  When I actually asked Bart about it later, he didn't think it was a problem, as it gave him a chance to clear the air. Of course he has that unique gift of being able to say standard cliche type things like ""At the end of the day, it is what it is"" and make them seem profound in the moment, so yeah..."
Tribes,2ynlwy,w1nters,2,Wed Mar 11 19:21:10 2015 UTC,"That's not exactly what I meant, but I have always appreciated and respected your casting in particular. You are clearly a professional in your execution of 'radio personality'. You do a fantastic job.   I'm talking more about how most post game interviews became a platform for circle jerking nonsense instead of actually breaking down and analyzing the game vs what people expected and using relevant in game information to discuss.   It was always ambiguous."
Tribes,2ynlwy,duhlitz,1 point,Wed Mar 11 20:22:05 2015 UTC,"instead of actually breaking down and analyzing the game vs what people expected   If only we had demos to look back to...  But srsly, I always hated that there were never any replays we could be shown for the casters to analyse with the involved players, because a nail-biting game usually has so many individual events it's hard to remember without some sort of playback (as far as relevant in game information is concerned)  I know a few people who would be interested in casting (me included) a new Tribes game (or an updated T:A), that would benefit from lots of casters watching individual players like dodge w/ NASL to put out a solid cast"
Tribes,2ynlwy,wordthompsonian,1 point,Wed Mar 11 20:30:38 2015 UTC,"Early on, there were more streams where we replayed casts and talked to players about them. The Area 51 guys in particular often reviewed their games later on their personal channels. I always thought this was a cool thing, much like the Sun morning local football coach shows of my youth where they watched game film from the previous week and gave insider analysis. But yeah, without demos it was the best that could be done, along with the weekly retrospective shows like Blue Plate.   (I won't get into the whole entertainment vs analysis thing here--have already said plenty on that in the past, haha. It's important to strike a balance with a good mix of both, though; I think that's something everyone agrees on, at least)"
Tribes,2ynlwy,w1nters,1 point,Wed Mar 11 21:17:01 2015 UTC,Bingo!
Tribes,2ynlwy,duhlitz,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:18:24 2015 UTC,"I appreciate that a lot man, thanks.  And yes, postgame emotions tended to run high in most cases. We did our best to redirect questions back toward the run of play whenever possible, but in the end it was about what the players themselves had to say. Sometimes that resulted in more philosophical conversation, and sometimes it was a bit more on the salty side. But hey that's showbiz, yeah?   I know that it would have been nice to have more tools available to casters (demos and etc) to help with breaking down some of the more densely packed events that happened throughout every game. There was so much happening worth deeper analysis in any given match that even if you put fourteen casters out there to follow each individual, there would be things missed. Hopefully these new titles currently being worked on will keep these issues in mind and come up with ways to address them more directly."

Tribes,2ymdr8,HighDiveTV,2,Wed Mar 11 00:07:58 2015 UTC,"I was looking over some of the stats, namely U.I.S. Disguise, and was curious as to what some of them are. GLMA is presumably Grenade Launcher Mid-Airs, and Rocketeers would be the Rocket Pod, but what are the rest?    Metric Number    MA pluses 231   MA supremes 66   Eat discs 20   GLMAs 25   MMAs 1   Rocketeers 9   SweetShots 85   OMGs 1   Fkag denses 145   Flag attacks 61   Flag pickups 61"
Tribes,2ymdr8,THEM0RNlNGW00D,2,Wed Mar 11 00:47:15 2015 UTC,MMAs could be mortar mid-airs.
Tribes,2ymdr8,evanvolm,2,Wed Mar 11 00:58:03 2015 UTC,"MA pluses, SweetShots, MA supremes, Eat discs and OMGs are ""rewards/statistics"" for the spinfusor disc. They are ordered from ordinary/short range to highly unlikely/far range. An OMG for example requires the disc to travel a few hundred in game distance, before it gets triggered, for example. As a direct result you can clearly note the difference in the amount of times he hit an Eat Disc (20) and a MA plus (231), to give an example.  As for where did the names come from? Someone simply made them up. They can be changed to whatever we want.  GLMA does indeed mean Grenade Launcher Mid-Air. Analog to this, MMAs stands for Mortar Mid-Airs.  Regarding the bottom three, there are some typing mistakes there. ""Flag denses"" stands for Flag defenses, not sure whether it reflects on the amount of times he killed an enemy near the flag or the enemy flag carrier. Flag Attacks stands for the amount of times he killed an enemy flag defender (I suppose) and Flag pickups speaks for itself, the amount of times he actually picked up the flag.  Please note that the data shown on that page is VERY incomplete (sometimes not even half the data got collected from a map to give you an idea) and hasn't been updated for over half a year, if not longer.  Hope that answers the question.  HighDive"

This game has the potential to be as big as any MOBA but noo..... they refused to give us the freedom that it needed."
Tribes,2ybktp,revofire,45,Mon Mar 9 21:01:34 2015 UTC,"We are ready for more Tribes now. The question is: Is HiRez ready? so far magic 8-ball says ""all signs point to no""."
Tribes,2ybktp,jojotmagnifficent,11,Sun Mar 8 08:26:19 2015 UTC,"thing is i think he is right. we are like 500 hundred active players left in all regions combined. tribes is such a special game with a very specific gameplay that you cant reach many people like you could do with smite. when we get more games like evolve, titanfall and so on where people get to know fast jetpack movement, maybe we'll reach that point soon. but i agree that the world is not ready for tribes yet."
Tribes,2ybktp,DortmunderJungs,33,Sun Mar 8 12:42:58 2015 UTC,"Part of the problem is that HiRez helped kill off the community by creating Ascend and bringing people into it and then not supporting it, refusing to give the players dedicated servers because lol modding and lol marketplace, not keeping their servers up and their ping down, not creating maps and not giving players the tools to create their own, et cetera. And Ascend helped splinter the community so now those who are unhappy with it have to choose between sticking to it, switching to Tribes 2, switching to Vengeance, switching to Legions: Overdrive, or just quitting altogether and playing entirely different games instead, like I did.  Tribes fans are ready for a new Tribes game, but we want a good game this time, we want what we were promised with Ascend. I have every confidence that if HiRez took the engine and graphics and sound they made for Ascend, gutted the progression bullshit and ""sidegrade"" items, gave map tools and dedicated servers to the community, and called it a relaunch, the playerbase would skyrocket. Counterstrike hasn't thrived for nearly twenty years because Valve stomped out player creations, it's because they embraced the maps, the mods (gun game), et cetera. HiRez could learn a thing or two from Valve on this."
Tribes,2ybktp,Mutericator,3,Sun Mar 8 12:51:34 2015 UTC,"Tribes fans are ready for a new Tribes game   yeah sure we are, but this few people would not justify Hirez to invest millions of dollars if they dont make any profit out of it again. Smite is so popular because it fits in the what i call ""MOBA-Meta"". LoL and Dota have 4 times the viewers all the other games on twitch have combined. Hirez wants another money maker just like Smite.   They dont want the Tribes Fans to be ready for a new Tribes, they want the world to be. and this will take some time"
Tribes,2ybktp,DortmunderJungs,5,Sun Mar 8 15:15:08 2015 UTC,"The world was ready, already tired of the modern military shooter as denoted by the sales of the genre following Ascend's release. But they were an indie studio attempting to monetize a workload only possible by a passionate community in the tens of thousands. Hi-Rez likely won't make another Tribes, a competitive FPSZ is not in line with their business model of churning out new characters to sell skins, voice packs, items, and booster packs."
Tribes,2ybktp,THEM0RNlNGW00D,3,Sun Mar 8 19:43:00 2015 UTC,"a competitive FPSZ is not in line with their business model of churning out new characters to sell skins, voice packs, items, and booster packs.   I disagree,  there were plenty of ideas thrown around by the community that would have made perfectly acceptable monetization schemes for HiRez, probably much more profitable than what they did. One I and many others proposed was armor sockets for each armor piece that you could use to mix and match different custom armor pieces like helms, pauldrons, chest plates etc., and you could do the same for base weapon skins (i.e. do it in parts with custom grips, discs, fusor rails etc., custom jetpack colors, disc trails, hell, even a ""trophy slot"" like the Griever skin's belt etc. etc., there could have been endless amounts of opportunity to add content to it a la TF2 style drops and marketplace, and it would have been fine with the old 3 armor class system that everyone wanted so long as aesthetic design was appropriate for identification (and they could have done so, their art/design team is by far the most competent part of the company). None of that would harm the comp scene, if anything it would strengthen it as it means fans can easily identify their favorite players by the custom armor they use.  Then all they had to do was stop using that shitty launcher and run through steam and get all the benefits of being able to release patches for free (a huge barrier to updates according to them), store/marketplace integration, and not having a shitty launcher that breaks all the time and makes people not want to play the game."
Tribes,2ybktp,jojotmagnifficent,2,Mon Mar 9 06:29:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think we actually know if Tribes could've been the success we all want it to be even if HiRez had played all of their cards right (or as right as they can be played). There's plenty of arguments against that being possible at all and several of them have been brought up. Tribes is inherently difficult, complicated and unique in a way that very well might scare a lot of people away. It's possible that a game like Tribes can't even be a viable product without being F2P and it might be the case that any F2P model is detrimental to the gameplay of Tribes. Yadda, yadda. We could ramble and speculate about that for years (in fact, we already have).  What we do know, however, is that there's been a lot of Tribes-like games over the past decade that have had no noticeable success whatsoever. Not because they've been bad or flawed, but merely because they haven't gotten enough attention to unite even the enthusiasts. T;A was the first game of this kind since T2 that got enough publicity to do that, even if temporarily, and it's safe to assume that we won't see another Tribes-like game garner that much attention unless one of the Big Studios goes nuts and decide to make one (yeah, right). It doesn't really matter whether Project Freefall or any of the other ones are just straight up better than T;A if they can't get high ratings, articles and videos onto the bigger games media stuff (PCG, Total Biscuit, IGN, EuroGamer etc. etc.).  That's the first obstacle to overcome for a game like Tribes to reach beyond the core communities and to break the splintering of the community at least temporarily. After that comes all the stuff that HiRez messed up and that's what annoys me. T;A was the first game in some ten years that could even attempt to answer whether Tribes could ever be an e-sport and it might be another decade before we see another attempt that can even overcome that first hurdle. Maybe it would have been possible if T;A had tutorials, if the tournaments got the support they needed, if there was demo recording, if there was balance, if it was less buggy, if the core mechanics weren't broken for high level play, if there was match making, if there was a map creator... Perhaps that would've been enough. Perhaps we needed even more stuff beyond that. Perhaps even if it was perfect it wouldn't be enough, because of reasons. What infuriates me the most is that HiRez didn't even get close to answering those questions."
Tribes,2ybktp,Shaeress,3,Mon Mar 9 08:03:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think it ever would have been DOTA or LoL kinda big, but I think it could have been both profitable and self sustaining.   After that comes all the stuff that HiRez messed up and that's what annoys me. T;A was the first game in some ten years that could even attempt to answer whether Tribes could ever be an e-sport   Completely agree, T:A was a serious case of the stars aligning for HiRez, they got handed pretty much the most amazing start that you could possibly have hoped for, but they basically did everything they could to squander that. They ignored so much good advice by the community and yet the things they did do were so obviously moronic that it hurts to even try and comprehend why they would do that."
Tribes,2ybktp,jojotmagnifficent,2,Mon Mar 9 08:17:45 2015 UTC,"They ignored so much good advice by the community and yet the things they did do were so obviously moronic that it hurts to even try and comprehend why they would do that.   To be fair, they also managed to ignore a lot of bad advice and almost all of the things that mostly everyone agreed would be good additions were big things that would take a lot of work to add. And I think a lot of it came down to the somewhat poor timing of the publicity. T;A got a lot of publicity, but it got almost all of that attention in early beta. I think it's natural and actually reasonable for a small studio like HiRez to try and press that advantage by rushing things along to the point that they have a marketable product in case that publicity runs out. That would explain the early release and some of the haphazardly put together features and the focus on profitable content early on.  I guess that was the safe and easy route for HiRez, since it pretty much guaranteed a moderate success for T;A. Can't blame a studio for doing that, even if it's disappointing... but it hardly excuses or even explains all of it. The poor communication (which is the mild way of putting it), lack of organisation and planning, bad design decisions after the early rush, lacking support and development of the game after the rush."
Tribes,2ybktp,Shaeress,3,Mon Mar 9 09:53:49 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Honestly, the way I can see a Tribes title succeeding in the modern market is via a community marketplace of skins for your guns, characters, etc. Look at CS:GO. People in the community create content, HiRez sells said content while giving tiny cut to the creators. Variety and money for all!  Obviously I'm a shitter and it isn't that simple, but it's a better system than they used."
Tribes,2ybktp,VGTGreatest,11,Sun Mar 8 21:35:54 2015 UTC,"However, Tribes: Ascend was absolutely hopping in its heyday. There is no doubt whatsoever that the people are out there, it's just that Tribes 1/2/V are old, decrepit and (mostly) dead, and T:A has been thoroughly ruined.  However, there are still small communities in the older Tribes games, just like T:A, most or all of whom would try out a new Tribes game. And there are also still oodles of people who are just biding their time, waiting for a good arena shooter and/or Tribes game to show up and part the seas of dull modern military shooters.  If a new Tribes game came out, and it maintained the core gameplay values of the old Tribes games, and it got serious, meaningful developer support, and there was community involvement through mapping modding and whatnot, and the approachability and learning curve were managed decently, then it would explode all over again.  People are just waiting for a good high-speed shooter to come along.  There just haven't been any that will grab people for a long time.  T:A was damn close, and if Hi-Rez hadn't all but purposefully killed it off, it would still be going strong."
Tribes,2ybktp,KoboldCommando,3,Sun Mar 8 14:56:36 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's sad but even with games like titanfall/advanced warfare there is still no real comparison with Tribes for the ability for casuals to pick it up and play. The only way I can really see it working is if there is a huge playerbase and good matchmaking so that you never play with people out of your league, but even then it will still suffer as an eSport because the people watching it will be all ""what the hell is that weird slidy thing they are doing down hills and why are they shooting the ground and hurting themselves :\ I don't get it"".  Tribes worked back in the day because all gamers were nerds who loved gronking game systems and developing skill etc. These days gamers are all average people who fry their brains at work/school and just want to come home and switch off and let brain cells seep out their ears as they get liquefied by Jersy Shore and the Kardashians. Having to actually put time and effort into learning and mastering a game is the opposite of what they want. It's why MOBAs are so popular, you can just pop open your buy order/time list on one monitor and then just click around on the screen at random and have your hero auto attack when appropriate without needing to aim anything, and even more commonly they don't even play it, they just watch streams of someone else playing it."

In the case of ta, far too many of us simply can't... not for lack of want.  Back in Nov/Dec 2012 when hirez made decision to move onto smite they did something to our servers. What exactly nobody knows, but all of a sudden servers that ran reasonably well for 2 years took a dump, globally, and never recovered.

Tribes,2y9bta,Radmite,7,Sat Mar 7 18:07:01 2015 UTC,"No.  880 damage for both. Yes, but only some.  Some have 0%, Most grenades have 20%, Most projectile weapons have 50%, Blinkfusor has 100%.  See this for more detail. They are most likely using their weapon/ grenade to disk/nitron jump to gain more forward speed at the cost of some health or just thrusting to the side to avoid the HoF. Grenades can be opinion based.  I use explosive, but I know plenty of people use the impact nitron.  I'm not sure if anyone uses compact. Superheavy, the perk that allows damage upon impact, does work just as well on a light class as it would with a heavier class.  I would, however, recommend that you use it mostly for HoF (or LoF in some situations) as it doesn't have much of a purpose outside of that (except maybe using it as a sniper so you don't get booted around as much by enemy disks..) Tribes is...empty.  I don't like using the word ""dead"" that a lot of people tend to use, because there are still a couple hundred regular players, but the game was dropped by HiRez and it lost the majority of its player base over time.  Some of us have stayed, though :D Fractals are cheap in some situations.  I understand how they could be useful for clearing stands and such, but a large amount of people use them for spamming the inside of generator rooms for easy kills.  They have amounted a bad reputation as just being spamming devices. PLAY A LOT.  Just play and play and play.  The more you play, the more you'll understand and figure out.  You'll find some friends that can help you, gain more skills, and learn to ignore the trolls and meanies.  :D"
Tribes,2y9bta,Schreq,3,Sat Mar 7 18:26:29 2015 UTC,8) pratice
Tribes,2y9bta,Theheartattack,6,Sat Mar 7 20:14:09 2015 UTC,"1) No  2) Everything has 50% inheritance except blinksfusor which has 100%  3) You can flick your mouse to the left or right and thrust to get around the heavy on flag if you time it right  4) A lot of cappers started off with impact nitrons and then moved onto explosive nitrons when they were more comfortable with the routes.  5) Super heavy is the perk and it works with every class but they have to be skiiing into you, it's not the other way around so you can't be a bowling ball.   6) Timezones? What region are you in? Also the quick match is REALLY bad so use the server browser.  7) The recent complaints about fractals on reddit are mostly in the pug scene of tribes. In pubs its prolly cause people like to ""gen party"" which is grabbing the flag and going into the gen to dump fractals and get kills. (if you want to try pugs details are at playapug.com)  8) Stick with it honestly, try to gradually lower your sensitivity/dpi, turn off big weapon models, maybe up your FOV a little bit. You can find the best loadouts for each class and position on this subreddit. If you're having issues with framerate in the sidebar under ""player guides and gameplay tweaks"" you can find out how to change your settings more than you can in game."
Tribes,2y9bta,qhp,2,Sat Mar 7 18:34:50 2015 UTC,"some misinformation, but a lot of good answers here. compiled my list:   1.) Is there a damage difference between the Blinksfusor and the Dueling Spinfusor on a direct hit?   No.   2.) Do projectiles inherit forward momentum? (Will they move faster forward if I shoot it forward at high speeds)   Yes and no. The link given by /u/Radmite is pretty accurate. Note that projectiles inherit all directions of momentum, not just the way you are looking (often forward). To get your weapon's trajectory, do vector addition of [your weapon's muzzle velocity at the angle you are aiming] + [your momentum in the direction you are moving]*[0 <= inheritance value <= 1.00]   3.) Why do I see flag cappers flick their mouse right as they touch the flag?   Most likely you see this in montages and stuff? If they flick the mouse (with real purpose) just before grabbing the flag, often they are using a thrust to redirect themselves in an attempt to confuse/avoid the HOF.  4.) What grenade should I be using on a flag capping pathfinder?  This used to be arguable but these days there's very little reason not to use Explosive Nitrons. Their impulse (on both you and enemies) cannot be ignored. If you want to be more versatile in pubs, you certainly can run routes successfully with Impact Nitrons, usually using 2 nitrons and 1 main weapon shot to boost, saving your last nitron for a boost before you grab the flag. Having this impact nitron means you can break off from route and have a good chance at stopping an enemy flag carrier from capping.   5.) Does the ""damage other players when they run into you"" (idk what it's called atm) work as well with light classes or is the damage based on mass?   Damage is based on speed of the target when they run into you. This does not work the other way around (a pathfinder running superheavy and thrusting into someone will not cause any damage). You can run superheavy on non-heavy classes although the limitations on movement is usually enough to consider a different perk. You'll see many infiltrators running superheavy and sitting on their own flag stand to troll incoming cappers into thinking the stand is empty.   6.) Why can't I find any servers with more than 3 people?   Change your filters to get every server in the browser. There's always servers with more than 3 people playing, but maybe not in your region. Game is not very active and is only active in NA and EU regions now.   7.) Why does everyone complain about fractals?   Well, not everyone. They are annoying because there is nothing you can do to ""counter"" them. You cannot destroy them by shooting them, you cannot always jump in for just a second (knockback is just annoying enough to mess up these attempts) to get a block, and they are just plain ""easy."" The most vocal of Tribes players, in general, are against things that are fundamentally ""easy"" or ""free"" like turrets or fractals even though they do play an important part in the game.    8.) How can I get better?   As with anything, practice. Pick a role, stick to it. Play PUGs, play other Tribes-like games (and Tribes predecessors) and just keep trucking on. The game is not created to be easy."
Tribes,2y9bta,wordthompsonian,1 point,Sun Mar 8 05:18:38 2015 UTC,"Blinks and duel are both 880, and yes the faster you go with any spinfusor will give it more speed. There is 50% inheritance on all fusors except blinks, so you will always impart more speed to the disc the faster you go. Everything else achus said is correct"
Tribes,2y9bta,MKRWSeek,1 point,Sat Mar 7 18:26:07 2015 UTC,"1.) No they're the same   2.) Yes, most projectiles inherit 50% of your forward momentum (minus the blinksfusor, and the dust devil/arx buster I think?)  3.) They are probably using thrust pack to go to the side of the defense (effectively juking their blocks and shots)   4.) All about preference, but explosive is what most people use on PTH capping   5.) Super heavy works on all classes no matter the mass (max 1000 DMG however)   6.) Use the server browser to find servers in your area (region) unless you are from s. America or asia, there should be servers with more than 3 people (Australia/Oceania is hit or miss)   7.) Fractals are tools for area denial commonly abused by people to get free kills without even aiming at anyone, fractals on stand (especially with no team damage) is an easy way to clear for cappers if you are against a poor to below average defense.   8.) Just keep playing. Find a role you want and stick with it. Chain people when they are in the air, shoot their feet with an explosive weapon (ground pounding) when they are on the ground. And if you are dying consistently, study the enemy and see what they are doing and why they killed you. Positioning is important also, if you can get around a hill or corner and avoid being groundpounded, it is much harder to kill you.   EDIT: In the time it took me to make this other people have said p much the exact same things. You can get some definitive answers from everyone else"
Tribes,2y9bta,Achus619,-2,Sat Mar 7 18:30:01 2015 UTC,"1.- don't remember right now  2.- nope. (Blink will tho)  3.- what? you mean when grabbing? there's no need to flick when doing it, you may have seen videos where the capper aims to one side and uses thrust to slightly dodge the HoF  4.- explosive or impact nitron. Explosive won't make you conc yourself if post grab jump, impact can be used right before grab, giving a little more speed without taking much hp   5.- AFAIK damage inflicted by super heavy perk is based on the speed of the other player, has nothing to do with type of class/mass  6.- gaem ded. If you're NA, there's at least 3-4 servers with 20-28 players every night, and I'm quite sure yurop is the same or even bigger.  7.- they mad  8.- play more"
Tribes,2y9bta,Will12239,-1,Sat Mar 7 18:23:10 2015 UTC,"1.) Be careful with the blinksfusor. It uses different inheritance from all other projectile weapons while being no other different than a standard spinfusor. I think it destroys your aim for other weapons. 2.) Projectiles use all movement for inheritance. I often step forward and shoot in order to boost the speed of the shot a little. 3.) I flick my mouse 180 degrees to either disc jump or see who's chasing. 4.) Explosive nitron. When you disc jump or grenade jump, remember to hit right click (jet) right as you do it and you can get even more speed. It's not too hard. It looks like you're jumping into your disc jump, if that makes sense. 5.) Only works while using Super Heavy Perk. 6.) Look in both east and west for servers. 7.) People can't jump out of the way before the fractal begins b/c they're noobs. 8.) Practice using double discs so you don't have that easy pistol finisher and you have to connect with discs all the time."

There is so many groundpunds (most of your kills are groundpounds) and chains that there is no fun to look at the video. If I want to look at good people frag, I just have to log on to Twitch. A bit of chain, then groundpund a target that is right in front of you, just no. A person as skilled as you should never have them in a video.  There is soooo many times where the enemy is 1vs2-3 where your teawm are chaning him and you groundpund him to death, after your team have wakened him.  The worst ting you put in this video are where other people are weakening a target and then you turn around and put one bullet into the target to kill it, and put it in the video because it was a kill.... Man that is so wrong in so many ways if you wan to make a ""highlight"" video.  I know I am being a bit of an ars when I post this, but I rather be honest about it than you get the wrong feedback. Most people are not interested in watching you do a ton of ""easy"" kills, even if it do take skill to do get them regularly. They want to see highlights of the game. Good kills, random shots, mindpopping e-grabbs. Not groundpunds."
Tribes,2yas5z,ZtriDer,-5,Sun Mar 8 09:01:13 2015 UTC,"Do you know what is a draft ? Do you know what is roaming Defence ? Off course it's not a real Highlights, i just introduce the draft and what my TEAM does. But it's a lot of the time the highlights. I was having an idea, and this one was to have an other kind of editing. So i decide to put clips map/map. And because it was a competition, i was also thinking that if i shew a fully map, why i might erase this score board at the end? Don't tell me that nobody cares about the scoreboard (at the end).  For the ""groundpounds"" : We'll do a comeback into the first questions. Do you know what is roaming defence ? Do you know what is a draft ?  I'm asking because you are thinking that i should make only midairs on a draft competition ? Ok groundpounds is bad, but i'm roaming for destroy the enemy offence, the capper too if possible. So if i groundpound it's for kill to being free without enemy harassment.  More i kill faster more i'm usefull, so i groundpound. It's a draft competition and we must make our best for win. No? What i want to show is not on Groudpounds it's something else, if i has a clip with only one gp, it's for show something else.   In addition, for the ""1v2/3""  it's what defence are supposed to do. Play together for being coordinate? (Between Thanks Hapster for this, you was Awesome) It was a draft competition and not Pugs or Pubs, so i only made this video for 6 maps for show the draft plays.  I was knowing that i'll have that things in my thread. But i can understand you, it's just not the kind of editing that you like, you are over the gp. :) Or bellow mine sometimes ?"
Tribes,2yas5z,Lesteriuse,13,Sun Mar 8 11:45:01 2015 UTC,"hes right, though  2 minutes in, not a single truly montage worthy clip.  just felt like watching a slightly edited vod of a mediocre roam, which is exactly what it was"

Tribes,2yas5z,Loxiasus,-5,Mon Mar 9 09:15:47 2015 UTC,"Associe toi à gaocuhos la prochaine fois et faites un texte à deux où vous pourrez réunir vos forces afin d'argumenter, de commenter, ceci m'atteindra peut être venant d'un français. Sinon, pour te répondre, enfin, vous répondre* de première part, Shad il a fait un montage Pug, et j'ai simplement fait un edit récapitulatif de mes matches durant un Draft(1JOUR), crois-tu franchement que Shad a pondu ses clips en 1 jour comme je l'ai fait ? Je suis aussi en train de travailler sur un véritable montage où tu pourras retrouver ce genre d'actions(faites en 2MOIS). Alors avant de poster un message de ce genre, qui au final n'a aucune grande utilité, je te prie de bien te renseigner, car je ne vois pas le rapport entre le montage de shad et le mien, qui sont tout deux illustrés de deux aspects distincts, l'un sur l'histoire d'un joueur qui a joué 2 mois et l'un l'histoire d'un jour. Alors excuse moi de ne pas être E-sport tout les jours. Franchement, navré. Sinon à quand ton montage pour que je puisse me régaler ?  ""the critic of Ztrider relies on a lack of knowledge of the Tribes universe!"" C'est sur que l'on ne peut en dire la même de toi..."
Tribes,2yas5z,Loxiasus,5,Mon Mar 9 17:33:44 2015 UTC,"Google translate taught me French :D  Man, you really need to learn how to communicate with people. Attacking everyone around you because they do not agree with you is not a good way to ""share"" your fun.  You may think that criticism is an attack on you as a person, it is not. Most of us are trying to tell you what is working and what is not. You are quite young and have a long life in front of you, and during that time everyone will tell you what works and what does not. You can't go all protective every time someone criticism you.   As for Shad's video. Why do you think he uses several matches? Because even good players are not ""e-sporting"" every shot. They do not shoot midairs out of their arses.  It is because they don't use uninteresting shots in their videoes that they need to use several matches to be able to get a ""full"" video. Some ""highlight"" videos out there are just 2-3 minus long.  Well, anyway. Good luck on the next one. Don't take critisism personally. Look at it as a way to learn more. My motto in life is: ""To learn minimum 1 new thing every day""."

Tribes,2yas5z,Achus619,6,Mon Mar 9 17:52:46 2015 UTC,"You are seriously mistaking why people make this kind of videos. No one tells you to only do midairs in the game. You should do your best when palying, but when you make a video you only use the best skillshots from the game. Do not use all the useless shots or groudpunding. What your role is in the game does not matter. You need to understand what a “highlights” video is. Making a “highlight” video is not about showing off every kill you do, it is to show of the cool stuff that happened in the game from your POW.  Look at other videos from any other good comp player. You will not find any groundpunds or massive chainusage with lots of misses. They actually show point of interests. No one cares for groundpunds in a highlight or comp video. You are better off making a “Fulled’s fraggvideo”.  No one cares for a chainkill that used 2 clips to kill.  No one cares if you get 400 kills in a game, as long as they are just boring nonskillshots. Sure I’ll watch you do 400 skillshots, but I will not touch a video that has 400 groundpounds. I’m better of wach the stream from any other POW. No one cares to see the scoreboard at the end of a game in the video just so you can show off your 400 kills. You may think it is important, for you, but for us who watch the video it is just not interesting. You are showing yourself off as a person who tries to brag instead of trying to make an entertaining video."
Tribes,2yas5z,Theheartattack,-5,Sun Mar 8 14:30:24 2015 UTC,"Ok... Do you apreciate video of tribes ? I just make it cause it was a draft, i'm not taking my head for a video edit, i'll not make everything just for you. I was thinking that it was good, but like you JUDGE shamefully... It really motivate me to make other video...  You can never apreciate something in your life ? There isn't a video edit from tribes all the DAY. So yes if you don't like, don't put your bad things here and leave...   Don't talk for other people. Judge by yourself, not for someone else."
Tribes,2yas5z,freefoodd,11,Sun Mar 8 16:50:19 2015 UTC,"I never said that you should stop making videos, keep'em coming. Everyone should make videos IMO :)  But you have an serious problem with critical feedback. You can't take critic at all, if someone is trying to give you feedback that is not ""good"" as in ""oh my god you are awesome"" and tries to tell you a critical feedback, you go all ego and pull out ""I'm to good for this shit"". Making a video is not trying to show off how awesome you are, but how to entertaining a crowd.  But I guess this will just go in one ear and out the other....  I suggest that you sit back and take a good look at the better videos out there and how they are made.  Because you my think what you are doing is important and is awesome does not mean that everyone ells will think the same. You have the right to believe that what you are making is good, but ones you put it out there, I have the right to give you critics about your work. If you don't like feedback, then don't make a video available for everyone.  You need to evolve a bit more intuition around your own personality and skill. Take a reading of what people like to watch by seeing what is made already and what is populate.   Sure you should be proud of videos you make. It is about creativity and evolving your own skill and knowledge about video-editing, but if you are not willing to take any form for critical feedback that is not about praising you and how good you are, then there is no helping.   Keep making videos, it helps ""promote"" Tribes."
Tribes,2yas5z,OceanSheep,-1,Sun Mar 8 21:19:34 2015 UTC,"i know what you mean, but i also saw that some other person do not think like you and feel that it was good to make it like i did. So it's maybe not a Highlights, but it's an edit, that doesn't correspond as you want but there is everything for all flavour.   I don't like critic when they come like that."

The term MOBA gets thrown around a lot, but it doesn't really feel like that. You don't purchase items, although you can upgrade skills. There are koth capture points around the maps, where you summon monsters that offer specific bonuses (healing, defense, damage, adorableness).

Tribes,2y2utm,IhateAngryBirds,2,Fri Mar 6 16:16:03 2015 UTC,"My critiques:  you are losing tons of speed from poor skiing and as a result your routes really aren't hitting speeds that would make them better than very standard and much faster setups.  You are also not showing returns, which are important in my opinion, often more so than the route up to the grab."
Tribes,2y2utm,perroTW,2,Fri Mar 6 00:16:04 2015 UTC,I just figured the returns are standard returns that (most) people know. And yea agreed on the poor skiing these were just beta versions so to speak I made them about 10 minutes before I recorded these. But thanks for the opinions though
Tribes,2y2utm,angrypolak1,2,Fri Mar 6 00:18:48 2015 UTC,The point of these routes is to confuse the defense of where the capper is going with setups that look like other standard routes. Visibility and different approaches on the stand is more important than speed.
Tribes,2y2utm,Melur,4,Fri Mar 6 01:19:12 2015 UTC,"My biggest issue with these routes and the sh4z ones is that they go right past your own flagstand at really low hp. Any time there's any offence alive at your stand they're likely to chain you out. Could be really effective as a first route or when you know the other team just reset.   m&thers represent, tho. Great fun to see cool new routes posted daily!"
Tribes,2y2utm,turbohjelle,2,Fri Mar 6 01:46:18 2015 UTC,"I actually thought about that while making these. I justified it by thinking of routes such as the front on sunstar and the loop setup on arx, both I go in front of the stand at around half health (twice on the ss front sometimes) and usually never get killed. That was enough to make my lazy mind dismiss that:) But if it becomes an issue in pugs and such then I will look towards making an alternate setup that regens near the stand (or before it)   EDIT: moms2015"
Tribes,2y2utm,pard0n99,1 point,Fri Mar 6 02:08:02 2015 UTC,For all I know these have been done before but either way the 1st one starts GST and ends back right and the 2nd is just an alternate setup for the front mid route.

Tribes,2y0f6f,Sopar,1 point,Thu Mar 5 11:07:56 2015 UTC,So what would you say is the 'trick' to getting this consistent front-load speed?
Tribes,2y0f6f,Vondrak,13,Thu Mar 5 12:13:11 2015 UTC,Shooting yourself in the ass. Repeatedly.
Tribes,2y0f6f,indiceiris,2,Thu Mar 5 13:18:33 2015 UTC,"A couple of things, using the blackout grenade at the start is key otherwise you don't have enough energy to make it to the bowl after the last grenade jump. Then it's just a matter of working out exactly where/when you want to place your nades.   I use the reloading of the grenade launcher after the 2nd jump to get the timing on the 3rd jump right. Also jump-jetting after the second nade launcher jump to get the angle I'm shooting at more consistent."
Tribes,2y0f6f,Soninova,5,Thu Mar 5 22:23:38 2015 UTC,should try to do the sh4z route

If your hitting it at 340, you might get a return speed around 280-290.  That's pretty good.  I never got a 130 degree bounce Dort was talking about, I must be hitting it wrong.  A 130 degree bounce would be great for this route.  I never got 340 on this front, usually I get 310=( , basically I just keep going instead of hitting the first bounce in the video when I run this route normally.  Is there a better setup (I don't like going high in the air)?  Is there a video of this front run perfectly somewhere, I wants it."

I haven't been able to successfully launch it for a while, even after a reinstall. The trick to getting the good bounce is to not be descending when you hit the rock. Try to hit it at a flat angle.

Tribes,2xq4st,Rynex,9,Tue Mar 3 17:08:38 2015 UTC,"Back when the red reticule sniper triggerbotting was a thing, we found a way to circumvent it by using the raider's jammer pack. Testing this against you (and others) we found your aim went from being godlike to pretty mediocre. We went off the basis of your frag videos, that show you had difficulty hitting targets beyond the reach of the red reticule working, and missing shots that most ""good"" snipers would be hitting. This isn't meant to shit on the fact that you're a good player Vampwood, but this has always been a matter of concern.   You and people like you, are why I quit.   You quit because of people accusing you for exploiting a known flaw of the game (which was fixed the very moment you left) and calling you out on it? If you had continued playing T:A past the patch that removed the red reticule thing, I'm pretty sure you'd be a shining star of the game at this point, and many would have felt bad about even accusing you. Look at Flusha from CSGO. So many people are accusing him of cheating, yet he's shrugged it off and gained a loyal fanbase of people, probably larger than ever now. He simply doesn't care what people think. I'm also pretty sure there would be a lot of people feeling mighty embarrassed of themselves if they were wrong about it.  The thing is, with the time of your departure, you only confirmed our suspicions more that something was up. This is also the very first time I've brought it up, and the first time I've asked you.

Tribes,2xoldx,DaJ4ck3L,1 point,Sat Mar 7 02:47:24 2015 UTC,well yeah. My router comes from my ISP which sucks ass so they refuse to let me log into it myself. I asked them to open a 28000-28002 assigned to my internal IP address. That didn't work so I asked them to assign it to my (dynamic) external address. which they said they cant do cause it wont work. Am I on the right track for this stuff. I am also using particles repack as the base for my hosting files but Its looking like a few needed files for hosting might be missing such as I never had a temp folder or a masterserver.cs My Serverprefs should be set up correctly but there is a chance its they're not lol.

After that, you might get one more base map (SB, CC o RC), then it's usually PUB maps.  DX PUB and SH PUB are common.  PUB being naked spawns and no inventory stations(i.e. cluster).  Tonight's games so far have been Raindance base, DX base, and CC Delux.  Ain't over yet though."

Tribes,2xjr1h,persuasionlaser,2,Mon Mar 2 19:41:09 2015 UTC,"You don't actually have to be fast on DX, and can also do the route 300 on pathfinder, or just take another disc for extra speed on soldier.   It provides an option for when the offense can't get on stand to throw the flag up on the base."
Tribes,2xjr1h,MKRWSeek,2,Mon Mar 2 23:09:47 2015 UTC,"""slow"" should only refer to route setup time given how proficient defenses are in the current state. This has the same setup time as the path version, and the whopping 50 health of fall damage lost is because I'm a shitter."
Tribes,2xjr1h,angrypolak1,1 point,Mon Mar 2 23:43:51 2015 UTC,"With the behind the base bounce, you need to have offense on stand at the right time to throw the flag up on top of the base.

EDIT: Never mind, just tried, HiRez can't or wont handle + symbols, gmail aliases don't work. Can't comment on others."

Tribes,2xf4eg,Hellmark,2,Sat Feb 28 10:21:05 2015 UTC,I mean....
Tribes,2xf4eg,Dooder39,3,Sat Feb 28 17:49:42 2015 UTC,To those coming late to the party: there ARE some codes which still work. Use an AHK script like:   ^v:: SendInput {%clipboard%}   to try all codes faster. Start from #84 and go downwards.
Tribes,2xf4eg,DeadSource,2,Sat Feb 28 09:56:05 2015 UTC,"Or even:  Loop, read, putthefilenametothekeyshere.txt {     KeyWait, Control, D     SendRaw %A_LoopReadLine%     KeyWait, Control } return   Pastes a new one every time you press control."
Tribes,2xf4eg,mcpower_,1 point,Sat Feb 28 12:41:22 2015 UTC,Doesn't seem to work.  Scratch that. Just gotta start AHK before the game. I did manage to get it going.

Tribes,2xf4eg,angrypolak1,2,Sat Feb 28 10:28:53 2015 UTC,"You can't, and that's what this script is for. It sends the clipboard as keyboard strokes based on the hotkey Ctrl-V.  If that doesn't work, try replacing ^v:: with ^!c:: which is Ctrl-Alt-C."

Tribes,2xf4eg,Rickey985,0,Sat Feb 28 14:26:34 2015 UTC,p2w? You could probably get the strongest weapons in the game within a week or so.  Getting some of  the easy badges like going 300 sanics gives you 5k xp. The only thing p2w are perks mostly quickdraw. The goty unlocks all the weapons which unless you think the gladiator is op or something it won't help you and doesn't lvl up all of the items to mastered. Soldier has the best weapons in the game unlocked from the start so if your only complaint is it's p2w then I recommend not even playing.
Tribes,2xf4eg,Theheartattack,1 point,Sat Feb 28 15:17:28 2015 UTC,Yup. I am level 31 and I have everything in the game I want. I saw this goty thing and didn't even bother because I don't even care about the items I don't have.

Tribes,2xdphn,qhp,1 point,Sat Feb 28 23:10:38 2015 UTC,Basically what word said. The one real advantage to pathfinder in capping is how little time it takes to set up routes. I'd much rather have less attempts with each attempt being very strong than more attempts with each attempt being very weak.

After 10 minutes we were 7v7 and the rest of the night was some of the best T:A pubbing I've had this year."
Tribes,2x85an,FreeWebMason,2,Thu Feb 26 13:55:37 2015 UTC,"The only problem i have with pubs is the player limit 14/14. Immediatly, either the offense is stacked, or the defense is stacked.  This is why pugs are fine for me: The 7/7  makes the offense and defense (often) balanced"
Tribes,2x85an,abxel,5,Thu Feb 26 12:50:57 2015 UTC,"There's no reason you can't play both.  14/14 with good players who try to have fun, rather than prove something, allows for a fucking great Tribes experience in my opinion.  I didn't notice any stacking problems that couldn't be easily overcome either way when playing on that server. – When the snipers are benched, you get a ton more flag play."
Tribes,2x85an,FreeWebMason,2,Thu Feb 26 13:52:12 2015 UTC,"OF course you can have an epic 14/14 pub, but this is so rare. With 28 players on one server, it becomes stack very fast.

Tribes,2x93f5,Wolding,5,Thu Feb 26 17:33:29 2015 UTC,"Sniping in pubs is pretty easy, you can hit people on the other side of the map who can't even see you and you usually don't have to deal with spotting good cappers (or even care about them really). Plus it's a hassle to deal with a team with 2/3 snipers at the same time cause there's no good way to coordinate an offence push, that's usually when you see whining coming from the other team. If you care about good games and ""fair"" stuff, a rule of thumb would be to just play another class if your team is already stacked with snipers. If you are the only sniper, go bonkers with it. The other team shouldn't have much problem shutting you down."
Tribes,2x93f5,eightnine,5,Thu Feb 26 17:51:29 2015 UTC,"I only rly skimmed your post, so I hope this answers your question.  Sniping is a necessary evil.  Defense simply would not work w/o 500 dps  from fucking everywhere. LD open field battle w/ raider? lol.  HoF 1v2ing F spamming soldiers? gg  Unseen 400+ back route bouncing off 4 rocks w/ 20% packet loss? 'rb chasing.  To this day I'm not rly sure how defenses survive - no way will the meta work as we know (& love) it.    The game is fun when snipers are force multipliers: do enough damage for a HoF to gp + chain stop, help LD duel a LO (dps from sniper forces LO into awkward, ez ground pound low ground + making LD vs LO duels more interesting than pingvsping chain duels), duck hunt the crash enough so they're chainable / 1 diskable.   It doesn't rly matter how many kills / assists a sniper gets (within reason) - good sens can only assist their team, not carry (rip schmical).  Great snipers assist their team more in the time allotted.  Snipers are op / not fun to play against when they can do all that shit solo - like we see in pubs / highlow mix pugs.  When there is a huge skill differentiate, snipers aren't pressured for time or positioning. shitters can't sync, LO ez spot/chip damage routes, cappers high vis / low sanic, even medicore snipers can dominate games.  This divide quickly closes a the high level - tryhards disrupt in sync + only when needed, but rtcll/immune/remics/schmical/matin/iinferno do more in their limited time (tailspin was garbage, 5 sec respawn crutch op) Snipers do not have a skill ceiling - they are not limited by mechani-configs, only awareness / positioning / luck.    Snipers might be more fun to play against if scoped shots didn't reset regen (maybe noscope +  full damage shots reset) or it was a 1/2hk 4000+ sanic projectile (force positional games w/ cappers even if shit open map design + prevent long range chip if actively dodging).

It's difficult/frustrating for your average pub to deal with that. I think there were a few good colt and eagle users too. It takes some skill to point and click, the frustration comes in when 3 can point and click dots on 70% of the map and the dots can't fight back. That's very powerful. And yeah, people always complain."
Tribes,2x93f5,Likos,2,Thu Feb 26 18:23:27 2015 UTC,"Yea, eagle/sparrow isn't a big deal cause they are one of the weakest weapons in the game, even if they are scrubscan. You can deal with it by also having good aim but having a higher DPS weapon. Colt is really powerful so it can frustrating against really good players. You can generally still beat most by having ebtter positioning and playing smarter though. Some SEN sitting half the map away plinking you to death before you get within range of anything... you can't do shit about that. There is only one legit way to play SEN in pubs and that is swag blaster and nades only, playing O. I call it manly SEN."

Tribes,2x93f5,Gierling,1 point,Mon Mar 2 03:58:26 2015 UTC,"Easy? No, not really. Simple? Yeah, for the most part. Too easy? Hitting stuff in general is pretty difficult in T;A with any gun. The snipers are certainly different from explosives and chains, but sniping is generally more straight forward and simple than getting a blue plate or the intricate positional play, prediction and leading that chaining requires. All in all, I'm not sure which I'd consider easier... but that's not really what the question is about.  Is sniping too powerful? Is sniping too easy and simple? I don't think there's really a straight forward answer. More interestingly, why is there such a disdain and annoyance with snipers? Snipers certainly have a function to fill in T;A, for several reasons. One of these is just simply the movement systems. Since it's easier to maintain speed than it is to gain speed this means that chasing isn't really much of a thing in T;A. Since there's a high amount of air control you can't really reliably hit stuff at any considerable range. Explosives are rather easily dodged in any situation that's not close quarters, and this also explains why autos are so powerful. T;A also requires this reliability, rather than just potential to deal damage, since there's passive, quick and timed health regen. If you can't reliably deal even a bit of damage at a distance, enemies can just run away and regen. You can't really chase them because they can easily maintain their speed.  Sniping would be useful even if they only dealt 1 damage, if only to reliably disrupt regen. I doubt they'd see extensive use, but they'd still have a function to fill. Still, snipers deal a lot more damage than that, but the damage output in and of itself isn't an issue whatsoever. Really, the biggest issues/annoyances with snipers is, firstly, that you can't dodge them. With infinite range, no delay, clear visibility and instant hits there's not really anything you can do reactively to dodge a sniper. It's not a huge deal and I'm not even sure it's necessarily a problem. It is, however, very annoying since it removes a lot of the interaction that should arise when someone is killing you. The 1v1 of HoF vs Capper, LD vs LO, HoF vs LO, HO vs LD can all be greatly interactive and tense for both parties... dueling involves two active parties. But when you're getting sniped (just the wording of it gives it away), only one party is really interacting with the other. At best, you can try to move unpredictably to make it harder for the sniper to kill you, but that's about it. This is why it feels so shitty to be up against a sniper that's a lot more skilled than you. There are some ways to handle this, but they're not very viable. The two ways I've considered is very fast projectiles (which would also counter anyone claiming sniping is simple), but the game engine doesn't handle that too well. Super fast projectiles can sometimes clip, due to update rates and such, but that's a manageable problem if the engine is supposed to handle it (UE3 kind of isn't, I think). Server sync issues, however, tend to only get more notable the faster things are moving and the longer the distances are. T;A struggles with syncing as it is, so a super fast projectile sniper rifle aimed at fast moving cappers at very long distances is a situation that's just asking for problems. The other idea I've had is to just have a visible laser sight for zoomed in sniper rifles... but I'm not sure how significant the effect of that would be and such beams result in a lot of clipping, stuttering and cluttering. Just look at how the beams for call ins work sometimes.  The second, and more significant issue, is that snipers don't really have a setup time. The second a sentinel spaws they can be at maximum usefulness. Unlike other roles, they don't really have to get into position. Sometimes a position is a bit more useful, but for other classes it's generally necessary. This is magnified when we consider that the best sniping positions are on top of large hills, where enemies have to spend a lot of time just getting to you. The time investment to counter a sentinel is always greater than the time invested by the sentinel. This is why sentinels have longer respawn times, even if that's probably the most straight forward and ugly solution to the problem. It's also why sentinel stacking is so incredibly powerful and thus there's only one sniper allowed in comp play. After all, it just takes one good sniper to stop almost all cappers (even reactively) and even with double respawn time it takes impeccable timing to shut them down at the right time (provided that they don't get an early spot or late snipe :I ) and you already have to invest more time then they're putting in to counter them... if there are two good snipers in completely different locations it can be literally impossible to stop them both from killing your capper. If there are even more snipers? Well, we know how that goes.  None of the things I've brought up really stems from a design issue with the sentinels and sniper rifles themselves, but rather from design complexities from the rest of the game. Map design (fog, LoS blocking terrain, map size, reasonably achievable speeds, return routes, number of reasonably available routes etc.) and spawn positions HUGELY affects these things. If spawns were less random and generally at the base of hills (rather than on top of hills or the base, where vision is good and time investment for enemies is greater) or in the gener room snipers wouldn't need a 10s respawn timer (both of these spawn locations would greatly increase the time for offence to get into position though). If chasing was more viable, it could possibly replace sniping as the reactive way of dealing with fast cappers. If the health system was different there'd be no need for snipers to pick off weakened enemies, no need to poke at cappers just to disrupt regen or anything like that. If the movement system was different and the maps different, there might be more equal time investment for snipers compared to other defenders. If the combat and health system was different and some of the other classes were tweaked the other defenders might not need a constant support. If there were different spotting, communication, coordination and information tools there might not be a need for a constant spotter and over-viewer. As the game stands, we need all of those things for things to be even remotely stable (which is basically what mstarr said), and so the sentinels remained as they are to fill in all these gaps, to patch those leaky holes and to help keep the utter mess of band-aids, semi-improvised patchwork and criss-crossing balance issues that keeps the confusing mesh of a game that T;A is even remotely playable(?). All of the issues with the sentinel could probably be solved without changing even a single thing about the sentinel. Of course, changing these things would instead require a complete overhaul of several of the most essential and core mechanics of the game."

Tribes,2x3lz1,vejket,1 point,Wed Feb 25 15:43:39 2015 UTC,use 800 x 600 resolution (or something similar)
Tribes,2x3lz1,vejket,1 point,Wed Feb 25 13:54:48 2015 UTC,I'll try that thanks. I remember resolution not affecting fps when I first tried to change settings oddly enough. Hopefully it works this time.
Tribes,2x3lz1,VeradilGaming,1 point,Wed Feb 25 13:58:20 2015 UTC,"hmm... btw you can go actually lower than that, you can add custom resolution from windows + add it in tribes .ini. And limit targeted fps lower than 122hz since your monitor does not support it"

Tribes,2wzhwm,Nark51,10,Tue Feb 24 13:44:56 2015 UTC,"All of them, except HiRez pay2win milkingmachine T:A and probably like... Aerial Assault. Mod support effectively lets you change anything and everything that is opened to you by the devs through the use of a modding SDK or open source code. Custom mapping was also a major part of it."
Tribes,2wzhwm,Nark51,1 point,Tue Feb 24 14:54:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for explaining, I only played T:A so I had no idea what did the other Tribes Games provide to the community, it's both good and sad to hear, I just don't know why didn't HiRez develop T:A with modding in mind."
Tribes,2wzhwm,Zwitterions,6,Tue Feb 24 16:03:52 2015 UTC,"The bottom line on the reason for mod support is that nobody knows the game better than the people who invest hundreds (or thousands, in some players' cases) of hours playing it. Not even the people who developed the game could know more about it than the hardcore players. This is why HiRez failed hard, they were too strung up on selling overpowered jackals and plasma guns instead of fixing the huge amount of issues the players had with the game.  You can look at T2 Base and T2 Classic for what a game that the community was unhappy with, but the developers were can look like when the community has their hands on the tools to rebuild it."

Sorry the video does have ads but it is also one of the better videos I could find that talks about many of the added modifications. Shifter MOD
Tribes,2wzhwm,socalpk,9,Tue Feb 24 21:33:57 2015 UTC,"Proper tutorials and pub matchmaking - despite the enormous comp presence in the /r/tribes community, a lot of comp players came from simple pubbies. The pub community was always my home, but I never felt like the newbies had any game sense until we tried to train them, or even just explain a few things in chat. Once they had levelled enough they were thrown in with the entire population of high-ranked players, not all of whom are exactly welcoming. Tutorials and matchmaking would make the newblood experience a million times better and retain a lot of those people who gave up after level 11"
Tribes,2wzhwm,Altairi,1 point,Tue Feb 24 13:37:30 2015 UTC,That's a good perspective of what I wanted to hear about the learning curve. So having a good pub matchmaking would help noobies to match up with noobies and vets to  match up with their dear lovers.  Didn't Ascend have a matchmaking before the server browser came up? How was it?
Tribes,2wzhwm,duhlitz,4,Tue Feb 24 13:47:16 2015 UTC,"Tribes has never had matchmaking rather it had more roles that allowed even new players to help and contribute. Base defense for example was appreciated by all players in T1 and T2 because without it you only had naked spawn. Also there was no regen so having a TCN with a repair tool was nice as they could heal you. In T2 newer players often went heavy and loaded up onto transports and rained down mortars on enemy defenses and dropped flares when locked on, it didn't take tutorials or much experience to figure out these roles. Ascend focused more on solo skills so support and beginner roles never existed or were never useful or appreciated only demeaned and criticized, leaving many casual players out of the game entirely."
Tribes,2wzhwm,wordthompsonian,1 point,Tue Feb 24 17:10:58 2015 UTC,At one point when there were loads of players some kind of match making was in place. I think this was right after the games Steam release. The match making tried to throw people with similar rank on same server. I guess the player base just wasn't big enough for that so people kept ending on half empty servers and among wrong skill level. Or it just didn't work properly. So they ditched it.
Tribes,2wzhwm,duhlitz,1 point,Tue Feb 24 19:35:58 2015 UTC,but I never felt like the newbies had any game sense until we tried to train them   say what now
Tribes,2wzhwm,wordthompsonian,1 point,Wed Feb 25 03:22:26 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not, there is a community outside the PUG/Competitive community, of players who a) have never played Tribes before in their life or b) who never went into competitive, can still understand how the for-fun aspect of the game, are very skilled at what they do, and are very welcoming to new players in the game. [CAS] is one of those groups in category b).  Our mantra has always been to make sure new players don't get abused by shithead high-rankers deliberately fucking around to keep them interested in the game. A side effect of this is new players trying to understand how to move around in the game, how to play the objective for each different game mode, how to learn the ins and outs of a class, what the class is best used for, the basics of how to do things like playing Heavy on Flag, or chaser/LD, how to duel, teamwork, using the VGS chat, all that stuff.   So when I said ""we"", I was referring to [CAS], the clan I am proudly a part of, and when I said ""newbies have no game sense until we train them"" I meant we train the newbies to understand things like playing the objective, and different roles.

Tribes,2wzhwm,AFireInAsa,10,Thu Feb 26 01:29:17 2015 UTC,"A large enough community for decent matchmaking. This is probably the hardest thing to accomplish on my list. No gameplay affecting microtranscations. Map maker. We need lots of good maps and I don't think that's really happen in any Tribes game. Ascend was the worst culprit. Balanced and fun to use weapons. Aka fix the chain and disc. Lots of flag movement. None of these games where the flag is on the stand 90% of the time and offense have to play like a synchronized swim team to get the flag off. A balance between capping and chasing. And this is without any bullshit impact nitron mechanics. There shouldn't be a whole lot of unchaseable routes where if the capper gets the flag off the stand, there is no chance of catching him. Fun standoffs. No turtles where it feels like your offense is thrown into a meat grinder over and over. Lots of things to do for every player. Noobs should be given opportunities to feel like they are doing something productive. Some sort of high level matches. Whether that be some an integrated lobby system, ranked matchmaking, or easy-to-access-and-play pugs. And whatever it be, it should have voice communication. And this is a personal preference, but no invisibility stealth bullshit. I do think it could be balanced to be kinda shitty, but I'd rather just not see it."

I do think it could be balanced to be kinda shitty, but I'd rather just not see it.   What did you think of the cloak pack in T2 Classic, that had a relatively loud noise when it was active, plus footprints?  I've had a lot of fun with that - you know there's a cloaker around, sometimes you even know where he was a second ago (footprints), but you still have to guess where he is now.  That's always seemed pretty balanced to me.  People who are really good with the cloak pack can pull it off well, but it takes a lot of smart decisions - energy conservation, knowing when to walk/when to ski/when to shoot etc."
Tribes,2wzhwm,Xanthyr,2,Wed Feb 25 17:59:01 2015 UTC,"I'm still not a fan. I think, if anything, the TF2 method is the best. Where they have to undergo an uncloaking animation that takes some time before they can attack. It's also audible.  Another way to go is to make stealth only a mechanism to combat vehicles. They did this in Titanfall. Infantry can see someone stealthed fairly easily, but players in vehicles could not. This is a way to get around someone in, say, a shrike who's been wrecking you.  I really see stealth in FPS games as being fun for a few people and super anti-fun for everyone else."

It's very hard to feel like I'm contributing when the flag just doesn't move. It makes for stale, brainless repetition that doesn't feel rewarding or engaging. Not to say I don't have fun and that strategy isn't involved, but for a newblood like me it's very discouraging since there's such a high ceiling you have to get through, both in your own skill and how you amplify the skill of your teammates. I've yet to really feel like I'm contributing in a game even when I solo-clear the HoF and LD in one run because then my cap gets snipes, LD beats me for the return, I K-out, repeat."
Tribes,2wzhwm,Nark51,0,Thu Feb 26 01:39:24 2015 UTC,"Because as he said, you can't have a good offense at the highest level unless they run like a coordinated synchronized swim team. All the best offenses to ever play this game played that way with the exception of Vex that played an offense that sometimes saw 3 or 4 cappers in a match, very few other teams did that.   That's why I play PUG's the way I do, lightweight pathfinder offense, grav cycle raider grabs, etc. With snipers and LD as skilled as they are today you absolutely cannot rely on your capper to score points.   It's amazing people STILL don't understand that."

Tribes,2wzhwm,admax88,7,Tue Feb 24 21:55:46 2015 UTC,"A theoretically ""perfect"" Tribes game cannot exist, because it would need to be two conflicting things.  It needs to be Accessible to noobs so it can attract a mainstream audience, and is thus well-funded with frequent patches and support.  But it also needs an extremely high skill-ceiling, otherwise the hardcore (early-adopter) fanbase will get bored quickly.  So it creates a Balance nightmare, where you can't make controls too simple (e.g. this sub's disgust at TitanFall's movement), or you have what's killing NS2 right now: 1-2 leet players can stack and kill entire servers, with noobs just dying repeatedly instead of having fun."

Tribes,2wzhwm,Nark51,5,Tue Feb 24 14:58:40 2015 UTC,"This.  Matchmaking has come a long ways.  You don't need to somehow balance the gameplay so that a few pros can't nuke a server full of complete noobs.  Just balance the skill levels of each team.  The real challenge is in providing gameplay that is fun for noobs and fun for pros, but it doesn't have to be for both at the same time."

Tribes,2wzhwm,Nark51,1 point,Tue Feb 24 22:40:40 2015 UTC,"The thing that's unique about Tribes is the Z-axis element adds a huge degree of possibilities for play and strategy development, but is also ultimately the one single thing separating it into a category of its own from other FPS titles.   Outside of the Z-axis, Tribes is as easy to comprehend to a Quake player as it is to a CS player, and yes, a COD player. Mechanically, as soon as you realize that every weapon behaves similarly to a rocket launcher from any other FPS, you know how to play. From there it's mastering moving through a map (for the sake of argument, that is opposed to learning your timing on pickups in Quake, or headshot positions in CS)."
Tribes,2wzhwm,DR_MEESEEKS_PHD,4,Tue Feb 24 23:02:07 2015 UTC,"I'd just build on the solution that evolved organically in Tribes 2:  You had your 32vs32 player pub mayhems on large, overtly complex maps with on average long travel times. You mostly avoid the issue of 1-2 players owning up the entire server simply by the volume of total players and size of the playing field.  Then you had your 7v7 comp, favoring simplified maps (smaller, more exposed assets) optimized for small teams.   The base game ruleset is technically exactly identical for both. But as the maps and amount of max players change, so does the viability and impact of different equipment and strategies."
Tribes,2wzhwm,THEM0RNlNGW00D,2,Tue Feb 24 16:18:24 2015 UTC,"CS:GO handles it pretty well. Casual pubs are full of shitters using AWPs because they're easy (especially massed in a 10v10 vs other shitters), everyone gets free armor and more money because it's more accessible for new players so they don't get raped by the economy game.   Comp matchmaking follows competitive rules which is all about the economy, but isn't different enough rules-wise for people coming from casual to not know how to play (look at T:A with the latest rulesets compared to the shit allowed in pubs, THAT is different, you have to brief any player new to it with 5 pages worth of rules).  Easy for casual shitters to get into, high skill ceiling in competitive matchmaking if they want to better themselves. Game is chock-full of $kins/$tickers/crate$ micro-transactions/drops to keep it alive even to people who like to just look at pretty guns. Some keys for certain crates get sold for money to go towards tournaments and the like.  I remember when HiRez promised competitive matchmaking for Tribes Ascend back in 2011!"
Tribes,2wzhwm,yeum,1 point,Tue Feb 24 15:01:36 2015 UTC,"Indeed, the learning curve of any Tribes Game is really hard, but would you think making a set of simpler maps would help new players to get in touch with the controls? While veterans would just have the normal Tribes Maps or community made ones to have fun with each other, and once a new player could learn everything they need either from simpler maps or a good, single player tutorial and then just jump in with the vets.  Maybe having a good single player tutorial would do it."
Tribes,2wzhwm,DR_MEESEEKS_PHD,1 point,Tue Feb 24 13:42:20 2015 UTC,"Actually, Evolve's system of unlocking weapons would be great for getting noobs up to speed.  Every new weapon they unlock plays a tutorial video before their next match, and they need to be proficient in all weapons of each tier before moving up.  That, plus (skill-weighted) Force Scramble votes would be a step in the right direction.  EDIT:   a set of simpler maps would help new players to get in touch with the controls?   In my experience from Supraball, smaller maps just meant that noob's mistakes are amplified, and they get dominated harder.  Maybe a Vs BOT Arena though?"

So let's say you choose to practice Heavy Offense. Once you get within a certain radius of the enemy flagstand, an allied Bot spawns in a random pre-programmed route, says [VFF], and a countdown timer at 0:20 appears on your screen. Your goal is to knock the enemy HoF Bot off the flagstand (or kill him) before the capper Bot grabs at 0:00.  This could be a nifty practice mode for pros, and would teach noobs what to expect from their teammates. Other roles could be added too, and if done right, would actually be a fun way for both noobs and pros to get better."

Tribes,2wzhwm,Nark51,17,Tue Feb 24 23:04:20 2015 UTC,"Not free to play. I'm sorry, but games like this generally can't survive in a populated and balanced state when you can just buy weaponry for real cash out of the gate. Microtransactions are fine, but they can only be cosmetic. The game needs to follow either Toxikk's way of thinking, where it's a one-time purchase to play and everything is unlocked from the get-go, or like CS:GO where it's a one-time buy in to the base game with cosmetic-only purchases you can also opt to buy. Editing tools so the community can create maps and modify game modes. No silly xp grinds. The way Ascend was built it's like being kicked in the teeth. You grind to buy a weapon, and then have to grind some more to make it better. This puts players without loads of free time or cash to burn at a disadvantage compared to those who do. Proper tutorials. When I think of the older Tribes titles, or even better, Battletech games, those tutorials might've been dry or sometimes really basic, but they're necessary and cover all the entry-level info you need to start playing. Player movement, weapons & items, vehicles,  communication, etc. Simplify this nonsensical class-based system. We never needed 3 separate classes for each armor type. Go back to the classic style of ""everyone gets access to these types of weapons, and each armor has exclusivity of one or two specific pieces of the arsenal."" On the topic of weaponry, every armor needs a Spinfusor primary. Not a chain primary, or a hitscan primary, or a grenade primary. A Spinfusor. If you want to have different ""classes"" of fusors, fine, but don't complain about having to balance it. Then each armor should have a slot for a unique chain-based weapon. Finally, have a third place for the weapons that are only usable by that armor class. So you would have setups like: Lights with fusor, an SMG (think like Ascend's Rhino or TCN4) and a sniper rifle; Mediums with fusor, AR, and a grenade-launcher; Heavies with fusor, chaingun, and mortar. This way, it follows a ""energy/ballistic/special"" style loadout. Why is there an Infiltrator in my Tribes? I'm here to go fast, not creep around hoping for an easy frag on a Sentinel/Technician. Please, no stealth-focused packs/items. Camo and Smoke nades are just terrible. Ditch the HALO-style one-button quick melee. It may look cool to land mid-air, but that's what the Shocklance is for. Ditch hitscan weapons. Outside of a sniper rifle for light armors, they really have no place in a Tribes game, IMO. Ditch perks. Seriously, I view this to be one of Ascend's biggest missteps. Faster weapon switch and belt throws, increased belt radius, reduced self damage for easier boosting/disc jumping, extra mines, gravity and run-over immunity, increased flag grab range. It makes skilled players even harder to deal with while teaching new players bad habits because the perks can simply be relied on like a crutch. Better matchmaking. I can only imagine that with the joke tutorial Ascend has, there might've been thousands of newbloods that downloaded, ran through the tutorial and hit level 8 after one day of playing or less, and then were thrown to the wolves, being stuck in pubs versus series vets and people involved with competitive. Many probably didn't bother to stick it out and went back to other games or found something else. We needed a setup where there were servers for every ""x"" levels, so a 10 and under server, a 10-20 server, etc. Also, better friend management so people could easily play together and join each others games. A reliable in-game voice chat. While I've always felt Tribes had one of the absolute best quick-chat systems, there needs to be a high-quality, in-game voice client. At newbie levels this might result in tons of chaos, but as people play with more experienced players, they will learn to use it effectively just like how their skills and game sense should improve also.  Retool this health regen nonsense. Either regen needs to take longer to start and be slower, or bail on it entirely and have health packs the player has to actively use. Ascend's health system breeds gen-camping fatties and careless cappers. Especially when combined with the super-fast respawn.   EDIT: A few more for your consideration -   Remove Orbital Strikes entirely. Players who can already shitstomp a defending force solo in a pub shouldn't be rewarded with a means of potentially wiping a 12 man team, or a large portion of it. Tactical Strikes can stay if they get more tweaking, but you might as well throw them out too. Mid-match credits need to go. Inventory stations should be a pack item available for all three weights to equip and deploy, at the cost of the class' ability to equip a pack unique to it's weight. Pack items should also be unified. Start each class with some form of the Survival pack to begin with, and then have the weight dictate the style of pack available. So lights should have energy regen and thrust packs, mediums should get general purpose ""good for anything"" packs like jammer and shield, and heavies get health regen or shield wall (not Heavy Shield from Brute - heavies already have the most HP and highest damage weapons, they don't need to turn their energy into EHP for an even larger health pool)."
Tribes,2wzhwm,matisata,1 point,Tue Feb 24 16:14:35 2015 UTC,"I like everything about this recommendation. A word on perks though; I feel like CS:GO almost uses balance updates as ""perks,"" of a sort. In Ascend occasionally perks would allow a player to tweak a class to better fit the evolving meta, whereas in CS:GO, a weapon balance change will often forcibly change the metagame (see the recent CZ changes). Sometimes this can be detrimental to the game, but sometimes it can help keep things fresh.   Whether this sort of thing is approached as perks or constant updates from the publisher depends on how the publisher has laid out their business model. Constant support is great, but for that they need a constant stream of cash. That either means cosmetics, sequels, or DLC, as gaming currently does it."
Tribes,2wzhwm,AvianIsTheTerm,1 point,Tue Feb 24 21:39:22 2015 UTC,"Currently, the perks are simply too powerful. Instead of what we have, the upgrade you get for leveling up a weapon should have been the perks. So we have a perk that give everything extra ammo, or increased clip sizes, or increased reload speeds. These would be minor chages that can give certain people the edge in combat they need to win based on their position, without being as silly as something like a Juggernaut that can spit out 3 fusor disks faster than you can blink. Or having a Pathfinder that can hit max ski speed in one disc jump and be immune to both fall and vehicle runover damage.  It'd be best if it was cosmetics only for microtransaction purchases. You could do something a-la Payday 2, with Overkill pumping out official updates including new maps and weaponry alongside of regular balance updates and patches for fixing bugs/hacks, but it runs the risk of exactly the same balance issues Ascend currently has, and the fact that the player base might also start feeling ""nickel & dimed to death"" because each new addition would require a $3-7 purchase to stay current with base. The CS:GO model would be best, as everyone has access to all new content as soon as it's live, and has the opportunity to use it when the community says it's OP, over-nerfed and just right."

Financially they probably couldn't have copied DOTA, but this game had a pretty big playerbase, if the base game cost $15 with cosmetic unlocks then they could have made total bank without gimping their ability to add mod support et cetera."

They made mistakes, but I thought it was a brilliant story and really showed just what can be done in this vibrant universe (even if my personal theory is that the T:V story is a movie in-universe, I even did a big writeup about it...)"
Tribes,2wzhwm,VeradilGaming,3,Tue Feb 24 20:20:50 2015 UTC,"Difficult to write down what one would want in a so-called 'perfect Tribes game' without taking into account what made it great back then and recent gaming trends, since unfortunately they conflict with one another.  That, and these damn rose-tinted glasses can get in the way at times.    Without even going into gameplay design, the Tribes player in me would want full mod support, including a built-in map maker, a decent server browser and the ability to host our own servers.  This is how Tribes 1 and I believe Tribes 2 shipped.  However, most developers (both AAA and indie) are fully against most of these in today's world.    The most common reason given is that it simply takes more time and resources to implement said features, but unfortunately in a lot of (if not most) cases the underlying issue is that these tools would directly pose a threat to their business model.  No dev is quite comfortable with coming out and flat out saying this, since it admittedly makes them sound a bit sleezy.  I commend HiRezBart for doing so during the oh-so-lovely Tribal Council when user-made maps came up.   It's understandable when someone like DICE doesn't include these features because they have a big publisher looming over them demanding tight deadlines and expecting DLC after or during launch.  I don't like it at all, but I've come to accept and expect it from most AAA devs.  However, when indie guys also withhold these features it's pretty disappointing.  I won't name names or anything, but if an indie dev says that including tools like mod support or user-hosted servers would be too resource and time consuming, that says to me that they made a conscience decision from the very beginning not to include these tools at all.    If they wanted them, they would have started working on them from the beginning as they went.  When they side-step questions about mod support or never really give a clear-cut answer, then announce that their game will be F2P, color be unsurprised.  They probably never intended to include such features from the very beginning and were eying F2P from the get-go.  The benefits of going F2P are pretty big for both the consumer and business owner, but more-so for the business owner and it's not surprising seeing both AAA and indies going after this model and making it the norm.  As I said before, I don't like this at all but I've come to accept and expect it.  Fighting it is useless since it's a losing battle.  I'll never support it, but I've come to realize most people are okay with how things are these days.  As for actual gameplay design, I have no real concrete answer.  There's just too much to take into account and talk about, and I've already made a wall of text."

Tribes,2wzhwm,MortRouge,3,Tue Feb 24 22:23:34 2015 UTC,"I mention this below but for those who don't see it:   SUPPORT ROLES  Matchmaking is not necessary if the game included support roles. Support roles rarely need tutorials, most of these roles are simply obvious. Repair, help, destroy. As I mention below, all previous Tribes players appreciated the casual player who would defend and repair a base, without which there was only naked spawn. Also there was no regen, so some guy using a repair pack on you was helpful and appreciated. That guy may not know a lot but he could learn as he went repairing AND making that bit of difference. Support roles make the game feel like a team game. Load up a transport with a bunch of heavy noobs and their mortars can rain down on the enemy base without knowing how to ski, or even aim very well. But they had a great time doing it. And that my friends keeps players, many eventually choose to continue to go from noob to casual to comp.  CUSTOMIZATION AND ENDLESS MAPS  Allowing the community to build the game, allows the game to grow and meet all the various concepts of what is fun in Tribes. I used to love just getting online and exploring new maps people made, getting lost was actually possible due to the larger sizes of some maps. Indoor flags, MODS like Shifter, allowed players to keep experimenting and learning new strategies while others enjoy the raw minimal or classic elements of the game, it's all good...and should be possible.  MAKE FRIENDS  The game should allow and encourage communication. Nothing calls you back to battle than hanging out with friends. They are the ones to say ""Remember that time when.."", they are the one's that help you votekick players with bad attitudes etc. They simply make the game more interesting and fun. TA made zero effort in this and it shows how much they (HiRez) never understood what made Tribes really work for many of us. A Tribe isn't a bunch of strangers covering solo roles. A Tribe is a family or in this case a group of friends. Profiles, forums, lobby chat, in game voice, etc. all critical to Tribes, building groups of friends who like to play together. It's never been just a game of skill and tryouts, it's also been about teamwork, coordination and strategy even in pubs.  MINOR STUFF  Heavy armor should be heavy and slow, even when skiing. But it should also repel most autos and accept a lot of damage. TTK should be long. They should have a way to transport groups of heavies that is more efficient and faster than they can ski. Also some maps then should be bigger to make their attack more challenging to arrive.  Maps should be diverse not just cookie cutter flag on open vulnerable stands with gens in camp friendly locations for heavy access to flag clearing. This is where comp was a pain, they wanted every map to fit their formula, not every map had to be a good comp map, nor should it. But this is where custom map making comes in, if HiRez dumped a ton of maps out there then the players could pick and choose, which is a better option for all.  Personal opinion, autos were/are just overkill in TA in every way, and they make the game boring compared to the fights in previous Tribes. They should have been balanced to only a few situations, like finishers and chasers, IMO. But again customization and MODs would fix this through community popularity and acceptance. Those who love them would have their option as would those who don't and those who don't care either way."
Tribes,2wzhwm,Pumpelchce,2,Thu Feb 26 18:17:38 2015 UTC,"Expecting mod support is like assuming that devs will get it wrong no matter what. I think it's important to have proper tutorials as well as match-making in place before anything else.   As far as gameplay is concerned, I'd like to see realistic scales and physics; 3 classes (light, medium and heavy) with 2, 3 and 4 weapon slots respectively; weapons balanced around ctf; healthpack not regen; no broke mechanics like grappler lol  Bonus points for in-game irc function & proper demo system :-)"

Tribes,2wzhwm,factoid_,2,Tue Feb 24 21:29:14 2015 UTC,"A lot of things.  One that seems under-appreciated, though:  A proper Tribes game doesn't have perks/armor/weapon upgrades.  Tribes games in particular should stay away from this sort of thing, because little itty bitty differences between different players' equipment take away from the more intellectual, strategic type of combat you get in Tribes games.    For example: take reload times.  I play T2 a lot (there are a few of us left still), and I've pretty much got the spinfusor reload time burned into my brain by now.  That means that when I'm dueling someone, I can very precisely time my landings so that I'm (ideally) on the ground while their spinfusor is reloading, and in the air when they're firing.  With perks/weapon/armor upgrades, though, since you don't know which ones the other guy is using, you can't tell as precisely.  This both makes it harder to pick up the skill (since it's less consistent in your experience) and less precise in its use, meaning that the ceiling of this particular skill is lower.    Note that perks are a bigger culprit here than weapon/armor upgrades, because most of the time you can pretty much just assume that the other guy has all the upgrades for whatever he's using.  This is not true of perks.  This argument also applies to weapons that have minor variants which are basically the same thing, e.g. thumper vs. thumper DX.  Not knowing how big the other guy's splash radius means you don't know precisely how far to dodge, etc.  I know they tried to make the various variants distinguishable via different projectile colors, weapon sounds, etc. but that's just a band-aid.  The real issue is that they wanted to have lots and lots of weapons so that people would have more shit to buy."

It fundamentally restructures a game when you are told and advised to use spinfusors, but chain/hitscan are easier to use and yield better results. It altered comp into using whatever works best (as any professional would), but I would've liked to see comp develop more towards pros making incredible MAs on a regular basis and having projectiles run the show. I'm not saying it's easy to be a god of chain or hit every snipe, but including these weapon types take away many aspects that I think separate tribes from other fps (and why I can't find a replacement for this game).     Autos remove aspects like predicting shot pattern due to reload times, removes the large difference between being in air and on ground/cover, and it is easier to finish a low enemy (no chance at coming back from low hp). Ultimately it makes games more boring and predictable, adding features from the already withered genre of generic fps rather than the dynamic weapons found in arena fps.  I believe this confliction has lead to the demise of the game. You don't need updates to keep interest in a game, just interesting gameplay. The unique and exciting qualities of projectile weapons are why so many of us still play. Mastering midairs seems to have a skill gap matched only by real life skills such as shooting hoops."

Tribes,2wwbx6,angrypolak1,2,Tue Feb 24 02:22:22 2015 UTC,It's much easier to get a consistent bounce if you come at it from a different angle.  This is one setup I was playing around with.  http://youtu.be/nsF8vH3ZXVA
Tribes,2wwbx6,perroTW,1 point,Tue Feb 24 08:20:09 2015 UTC,"Well shit now I'm even more confused. I'll have to take a look at the wireframe of that rock or something. Thanks for the info, fam. Glad to see you're doing well :~)"
Tribes,2wwbx6,duhlitz,1 point,Tue Feb 24 08:49:16 2015 UTC,a friend of mine found a setup for himself aswell with that angle 3 days ago :D but thx :)
Tribes,2wwbx6,persuasionlaser,1 point,Tue Feb 24 08:35:42 2015 UTC,"it's been around a long time, and obviously would be considering it is the only rock in that area of the map that would offer an advantageous bounce.  Every time someone ""discovers"" a route this long after the game came out they should think to themselves ""how obvious is each part of this route?"" and realize that there are very likely few ""new"" routes, unless they are seriously out of left field.  Even before rock bouncing, most of the setups and final angles you STILL see today were being used, because they had been optimized by all the tryhards based on tearing apart the terrain.  Rockbouncing in most ways only added speed, lowered approach angles, and allowed people to elongate routes by pinballing around to add speed over time, but with few exceptions didn't change route beginnings from spawn or final angles of approach."
Tribes,2wwbx6,duhlitz,1 point,Wed Feb 25 17:27:38 2015 UTC,no shit because you can only make so many routes with limited maps and those old routes would have been discovered either way

Tribes,2wwbx6,T1LuiGi,1 point,Wed Feb 25 17:21:30 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to be all original content to be a ""new"" route. Think of the three left to right routes on Katabatic from the BE defense's perspective. They all look exactly the same up until the couple seconds before they grab the flag, but they're all different and were all ""new"" at one point.   Old routes will always be new to someone since there isn't one place anyone can go to view all the routes ever made. Hell, i've tried looking up routes that are currently standard but could never find them even though most everyone who plays pugs knows what they are.   Not a bad thing. It's nice to know people are still looking."

Tribes,2wtaqj,Bimplup,3,Sun Feb 22 23:52:25 2015 UTC,"Dynamix tried to slow down the gameplay with Tribes 2. The default game is known as ""base"". The community helped put together an update with a game mode known as ""classic"" that speeds it back up and is the mode people are referring to the majority of the time when they reference Tribes 2."
Tribes,2wtaqj,Aldaron07,1 point,Mon Feb 23 00:48:36 2015 UTC,I'm playing Tribes Next hosting my own game of capture the flag with bots to practice. Would that be an issue?
Tribes,2wtaqj,Zwitterions,1 point,Mon Feb 23 00:52:52 2015 UTC,I haven't played Tribes Next much but I think the offline portion still loads up base but the servers you join in multiplayer are running classic.

Tribes,2wtaqj,Ephixx,1 point,Tue Feb 24 21:58:51 2015 UTC,I just booted up Tribes 1 and have no problem skiing and going fast in it. Is Tribes 2 really that much slower?
Tribes,2wtaqj,socium,1 point,Mon Feb 23 02:35:43 2015 UTC,"If you were playing Tribes 2 Base, maybe.  It's noticeably slower than Tribes 2 Classic."
Tribes,2wtaqj,Ephixx,1 point,Mon Feb 23 02:39:27 2015 UTC,"Tribes Ascend baby  felt much easier    Tribes 2 isn't an easy game.   The clunkiness and jump skiing are part of the charm of the game. T:A's skiing might seem smooth and easy but it's also extremely predictable. T2's wasn't nearly as predictable, making groundshots, snipershots and the like harder to hit. Overall the movement system is just far more complex, where T:A's seems relatively straightforward and quite intuitive.   I mean, why else would someone like Etheralking put up a $500 reward for people who could beat him in duel. Can you see that happening in T:A?  You might like smooth and easy, that's fine because that's what Hirez wanted with the game. But give me that (to quote Lester)""clunky, non-responsive"" (lol) old game where the gameplay isn't severely limiting the player's capabilities. I would rather be challenged by the gameplay than being bored of it.  I don't want to come off as some T2 elitist, I do understand why T:A players wouldn't like it. Besides the gameplay, the lack of players or servers (ping) doesn't help. T2 also doesn't have the community to encourage and support players getting into the game like T1 seems to have. Not knowing the difference between base/classic is an example of that lack of support. Your best bet is to get into the game with someone who knows about it, rather than by yourself. Even then it would still take a while to appreciate it and understand why some players remain loyal to the game."
Tribes,2wtaqj,thisgameisverydead,1 point,Mon Feb 23 12:08:26 2015 UTC,"So all of the clunkyness and the difficulty of skiing in T2 you described, is the same apparent in T1? Is it harder/easier?"
Tribes,2wtaqj,Lesteriuse,1 point,Mon Feb 23 13:13:24 2015 UTC,"I've hardly played T1 so I can't comment on it accurately. Maybe someone else who has, can do."
Tribes,2wtaqj,Millimetri,1 point,Mon Feb 23 17:43:17 2015 UTC,"T1 skiing isn't quite as jumpy/bouncy as T2 skiing. You can actually hit a number of slopes and have it feel relatively smooth like in TA (not as smooth, obviously, because it wasn't intended to be). You can still crater while skiing down a slope like in T2, or hit a rough edge and bump, so it's more skill-based than TA.  I still prefer T1's skiing out of all the Tribes games tbh."

Tribes,2wp7v4,thynnmas,1 point,Sun Feb 22 15:45:52 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned in mumble, I think scheduling the games in two blocks with a planned break is the way to go. For this tourney with 7 games on sat, that would be something like 3 games at 5pm, then the last 4 at 8pm, giving you 45min per game with a 45min break (35min per game because potential OT + 10min setup between games). If your team needs more breaks between earlier games it just means less break in the big one. It will still ripple through and screw with other teams, but since it's only 3 games before the break that ripple should be smaller, and it incentivizes not fucking about as you then have a longer break to go eat/nap/shower of the stench of defeat...  In general though I think 7 maps may be one too many on a single night of trobes, especially for a draft..."

Timing 6.5 out / 7.5 out on a capper for last tick explosion is tricky, although knuttson stated in one of the last threads (pre S4?) that he had a hitrate of ~50% if not under fire and Sauon claimed in mumble he hits 20-25% of last ticks on cappers; and it's even easier to hit a ""move the flag if capper can't""-attempt since you have up to a 2s windows where they are in range."
Tribes,2whd8d,thynnmas,8,Fri Feb 20 00:01:24 2015 UTC,"I want to elaborate on this because it seems to be hard to get. If you throw 2 fractals (assuming extended for this, because that is what hofs do) before you die, you have about 6s where they are active on stand. This gives you a 75% chance of 350 damage on a 270 cap (avg high level SLD cap or pug pth cap), 50% chance of doing 700 damage. Without being on stand, having been dead for potentially 5s and having respawned already. That is better than mines half the time, and it cannot be avoided; it's RNG with statistically better stats than something we banned for bullshit. 700 dmg 50% of the time is not ""not an issue for cappers"", that is fucking important. It's 2 snipes. 75% chance of 350 damage is comparable to a 2nd shot from a sniper; sniper down on exit is important enough that most O-players don't K out if they can get it. So saying it's negligible is just flat out wrong."
Tribes,2whd8d,thynnmas,-2,Fri Feb 20 00:34:53 2015 UTC,"Your numbers are incorrect, see my edit to my post."
Tribes,2whd8d,thynnmas,6,Fri Feb 20 13:29:09 2015 UTC,"There is no need to do experiments, the value for fractal ticks is 0.2s, the speed conversion is 50 UU / m. We know this from the game's actual source files, the google doc I linked to angryploak below contains the numbers. My numbers assumed you get hit by every tick, because I had no numbers on the chance of ticks hitting you. You assume 1/4 in your edit but as far as I can tell that number is dragged out of thin air.  Lets take your invented 1/4 number and run with it. Percentages are now adjusted to a 0.25 of mine above, so we're down to 12.5% of 700 dmg at 270. That is still 1/8, or roughly twice per game, which is STILL bullshit. My damage calculations ignore the chance of getting hit by the final explosion, which would skew them higher. Also, that explosion works over the full area, meaning it adheres to the above percentages, and if you can time it, that's indeed a 0.3s window in which you can throw it to instagib any 270 PTH/SLD capper. That's a pretty big window...   Edit, 5. Damage from fractals is reported in the wiki to be done ""along the beams"", probably in an AOE that is not reported anywhere. Meaning the chance of getting hit is related to distance from center, making the calculations more tricky than assuming a raw 1/4 anyway. We don't have the numbers to do full math on this, the point of my illustratory math is that the chance is non-negligible, and that that in itself is bullshit enough to ban it."
Tribes,2whd8d,angrypolak1,-2,Fri Feb 20 13:40:28 2015 UTC,"(1+2+5.) The purpose of the experiments is to make accurate assumptions. In this case the area in which a fractal shot will actually hit, is such an assumption. And choosing 1/4 roughly matches with experimental data.  (3.) This is only relevant if the HoF dies on stand while having fractals and being able to throw them on stand while the capper is less than 10 out, which all together probably happen less than 8 times per game. So it's rather 700 damage less than once per game, which is rather negligible.  (4.) As I have shown the fractal burst will hit 1 out of 50 times. Making it also rather negligible."
Tribes,2whd8d,thynnmas,3,Fri Feb 20 13:58:20 2015 UTC,"(1+2+5) I'll see if I can find the SDK again and check the source for actual data because I'm piqued now, but you're matching to experimental data for which you have provided neither samples size nor evidence, and with the rather emotional attachment you're showing to fractals (see the wall of text in OP), forgive me for not trusting your data to be non-biased.  (3) Killing a Hof before 8 out (which is roughly when the fractal has to be thrown if thrown straight down, earlier if in an arc) means he's back up with concs. HoFs these days always have invos on stand and refill fractals after throwing them if done early. If you don't account for instagib-fractals, that is a misplay; we can assume that you have the chance to hold onto one and throw it you you want to, so ""less than 8 times per game"" is pardon my language, bollocks. And again, this requires O to be on stand 5 seconds earlier, with more chase built in because of it. It changes the way the game has to be played for the entire offence because of an uncounterable mechanic!    (4) As you have ""shown"", by assuming HoF is dead somewhere in a range pulled out of air with no planning involved on his part or thinking of other consequences related to killing a hof when cap is 10-15 out, you've shown that something that has no soft or hard counter is ""rather negligable"", while we still have games that go into OT when that negligable thing is accurding to your own (imo) VERY conservative numbers is likely to happen once in a BO3 (and an instagib on full health capper is cap-vs-non-cap chaning). We have different views of negligably my friend..."
Tribes,2whd8d,thynnmas,-2,Fri Feb 20 14:13:21 2015 UTC,"If the HoF gets killed early, then he respawns in PTH and fractals won't matter. If the HoF gets killed while he was off stand he can't throw fractals there. If the HoF gets suddenly killed by an unspotted offense he will be dead before getting to throw his fractals. If the HoF doesn't have fractals because his invos got destroyed, or he used them early, or the position of the invo makes it too dangerous to go to; then the HoF can't throw fractals. If the HoF is busy finishing off an offense player, he will not have the time to throw fractals. If the HoF is alive when the capper comes in he also can't just throw fractals on stand.  There are many common situations in which the HoF will either not die, or die without being able to fractal the stand. And it is for that reason, that fractals thrown upon death are negligible. It happens, but it certainly doesn't happen every run. And even if it does happen, the chances of the fractal having significant impact is low.  Just for comparison, consider a juggernauts ability to shoot a mortar straight up in the air when the capper is 10 or whatever. This would also have a chance to have significant impact on the game, but it won't happen very often. The same applies to the fractal, and while it is bullshit if it happens, it is NOT reliable, or common enough to justify the complete removal of one of the core items of a HoF."

Tribes,2whd8d,luminel,2,Fri Feb 20 13:07:56 2015 UTC,"Stats from https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApP4Z-Ep0n6TdDNXcEY2ODU2cjlBQjhwUk1GTi1kU1E#gid=2 (via the chain DPS chart) for AOE and fractal tick rate. Chance of being in area (300 radius) without getting hit going straight through the fractal (assumption I made that I didn't state) is given by the chance of the time it takes to travel through the fractal while it's not on a tick (meaning the relation between time in fractal area and the tick interval, given as 0.2s in the chart). I used 50 UU/m as biven in the chart, meaning 3000 UU/s (the speed required to travel 600UU/tick (0.2s)) is 60m/s or 216 km/h and rounded up to 220. That's the ""chance of not getting hit""-percentage. The other ones assume a uniform distribution of tick timing vs. entrance to sphere of damage for the capper and are simple statistic :)"
Tribes,2whd8d,qhp,0,Fri Feb 20 13:24:55 2015 UTC,"As stated in my edit you must consider that a fractal shot does not cause damage in the entire fractal area, which drops the chance to be hit significantly"

Tribes,2whd8d,Rynex,6,Thu Feb 19 23:16:57 2015 UTC,"WARNING: LONG UNORGANIZED POST AHEAD. HISTORY LESSON, Y'ALL. (TL;DR at the bottom too, yabish)  Everything below is from an old, US, competitive perspective.  Stateside, we have been using fractals in competitive play for significantly longer than EU (see this for a perfect example) and with different purposes. There are a few reasons they weren't banned from US competitive play:   Fractals started seeing real use in the US as a counter to glitchy mine placements (such as the ones on the outside of the stand, on the slant, on Katabatic). Fractals killed basically all of them and were basically the hard counter to these ... inventive ... mines. Way down the line, mines were banned while fractals were ignored. The burst effect wasn't explored enough in US competitive play until NATL S2-ish. This is because...   ...there was a point in T:A's life where the burst did not happen. Then, after some patch, the burst was added. I'd like to claim that Egocentric figured this out before many other teams did. At the very least, we tested it much more thoroughly and much earlier than any other team. Since it wasn't included in any patch notes, the weapon description for fractals were unchanged, and the burst happened seemingly randomly, I figured the new behavior was added entirely on accident. Some bug in changing its damage or something.  I did extensive testing and learned that this happened all the time with one color fractal (green), and rarely with the other (orange). I wrote an email to APC with a detailed bug report (it should be noted that, at this time, the development team was still active). My intended interpretation of my email was ""this buggy burst behavior should not happen on either fractal,"" but the actual interpretation on HiRez's end was ""this buggy burst behavior should happen non-randomly on both fractal types."" That's right, I am to blame for the current state of the burst effect.  So, the active development team patched it such that both fractals now burst 100% of the time. Even at this time, the consequences of this patch weren't explored fully. Fractals were still only an offensive tool, and weren't used on defense basically ever, because DMB with mines was still the best kind of HOF.  Then mines were banned. You still saw some BRT on offense, but not nearly as much as before. Most Brute players at this point were people who didn't have top-tier with chain (Blitz) or people who played hyper-defensively (bojinglebells). The burst was still not regarded as a problem until maps like Permafrost and Dangerous Crossing became common PUG/Scrim maps. The small/enclosed stand made for fractal bursts that killed everything. Egocentric also used this strategy (2-fractal 1-cap offense, sometimes 1-BRT 1-INF 1-cap) on Raindance to great effect (undefeated, IIRC. we made ZFZ forfeit a real tourney match because we picked Raindance), before and after the burst change.  Even then, they were not whined about as much as other offensive tools, only that the maps were very favorable for the Brute class.  But, with the ban of mines, people started dropping DMB for HOF. JUG HOF gained immense popularity after great success from Vir (who used JUG HOF even prior to the mine ban). Suddenly, while every HOF switched to JUG HOF, Vir switched to BRT HOF.  Vir is nothing if not consistent. He does not showboat. He does not take risks. He is, by far, the most consistent HOF of T:A (and probably of all Tribes, including his 5150 times). His strategy as HOF is simple, but incredibly effective:   Stay alive. Stand on flag. Look down and shoot the floor when the capper comes in. Get any exit-damage you can if the capper gets out.   Vir does not go for mid-airs on incoming cappers. Vir does not go for mortars on incoming cappers. Vir does not float to get a bodyblock pre-grab. He follows the above 4 steps like clockwork... which made him wonder: ""why bother with JUG?"" Having a mortar for exit shots is nice (and Vir's exit mortars were definitely on point), but the damage on the BRT disc is higher than the damage on the JUG disc. The switch made a lot of sense. Egocentric's HOF, Xanthyr, switched between JUG and BRT after that, depending on map.  Defensive fractals were popularized by Xanthyr, I think. Xanthyr has always had great timing. He could probably fire a mortar straight up at the perfect time such that it hits the capper when it comes straight back down. He started using the burst of the fractals to his advantage. Even if he dies, these burst fractals are like timed mines that are indestructible. As the capper who practiced endlessly against Xanthyr (to train us both): if I see those fractals while coming into the stand, I might as well press K. He had them down to a science. If the sniper had a remotely accurate call, the capper was going to die to fractals almost every time, and there's not much a capper or offense can do about it. A mechanic which has no counter (hard or soft) should not be in the game.  TL;DR: Yeah it's worth considering banning (defensive) fractals now that mines are banned. If I were HiRez, the fix would be to make fractals destructible to a direct hit. Also, if you want to know some T:A competitive history and see me throw a little shade, try to read my incoherent ramblings."

Tribes,2wf422,MKRWSeek,-7,Thu Feb 19 18:21:10 2015 UTC,"How about no?  Fractals are a tool for area denial on a limited scale. They are not terribly powerful and they are not a no-skill weapon. They are a reasonably well balanced tool for HoFs, and while they might be annoying at times, they are not so imbalanced or badly designed that a ban is justified."
Tribes,2wf422,hobowithabazooka,9,Thu Feb 19 12:10:38 2015 UTC,how about a ban on extended fractals?
Tribes,2wf422,Darksteve,0,Thu Feb 19 12:15:00 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you want to accomplish.  If you want to have fractals have a less lasting effect (similar to how mines got banned for being long lasting items), then banning extended fractals would serve that purpose, albeit just a difference of one or two seconds.  If you want to ""fix"" the ""problem"" that fractals can be annoying and not fun to play against, then banning extended fractals wouldn't achieve anything. But annoyance alone isn't sufficient reason for a ban anyway.  EDIT: It must be noted that fractals don't effectively deal a lot of damage, so one or two seconds more or less won't make much of a difference."
Tribes,2wf422,Schreq,6,Thu Feb 19 12:21:53 2015 UTC,"The problem with fractals isn't that they last a long time, it's the stupid 1500 damage instagib burst at the end."
Tribes,2wf422,reffee,12,Thu Feb 19 12:52:38 2015 UTC,"I'm still amazed at how much we seem to base the competitive rules based on intuition and emotion, rather than on analysis or on arguments.  There are some arguments for keeping fractals and some for removing them. The arguments for are rather simply that they have a function to fill and they're hardly overpowered in any regard. Sure, the burst damage at the end is very significant, but so is all grenade damage and dodging fractals is a LOT easier than other stuff. The extra damage is hardly unwarranted. Really, for something to get banned there should be very substantial arguments for such a ban, rather than substantial arguments for keeping it.  The arguments for removing it is firstly that it's not filling the function it's supposed to or that it's not filling that function in the way it's supposed to or that it's a bad function for something to fill to begin with, due to the core mechanics of the game. Area of denial is an incredibly powerful thing in T;A and that's why we've ended up removing practically everything that grants any kind of area of denial (tech turrets, base turrets, mines, proxy nades, half the forcefields), and when a fractal's gone down it's impossible to get rid of it for the duration of the fractal.  Personally though, I find that to be a rather weak argument. At worst, fractals are an annoyance and anyone going fast should be fine unless they get hit by the end blast (which is a timed effect, so it shouldn't be more avoidable than, say, a sticky nade and we're fine with those). I think that the main argument against fractals is the emphasis on that should. Fractals are random as fuck, sometimes leaving someone walking straight through them unscathed and sometimes hitting fast cappers more than once (sometimes even killing them, without the end blast). They're also glitchy, with their radius sometimes extending and the graphics glitching through walls, suddenly going super far or even not showing up. This is really the biggest issue with them, because it makes it impossible to assess how dangerous a fractal will be and since they can end up so very powerful sometimes and so weak sometimes that randomness can certainly determine the outcome of important situations. Something being both powerful and random could be a sufficient reason for removing it from competitive play... but what do I know?"
Tribes,2wf422,Fulled,1 point,Thu Feb 19 14:35:59 2015 UTC,I think it's more of the annoyance factor that 2 well placed fractals on a small stand can give the hof nightmares when he sleeps at night
Tribes,2wf422,angrypolak1,1 point,Thu Feb 19 15:21:54 2015 UTC,Nah whenever that happens I just dump 6 fractals of my own and transfer the nightmares to the capper
Tribes,2wf422,reffee,-1,Thu Feb 19 19:33:50 2015 UTC,"the only difference is that extended fractals stay like 0,9 seconds longer. if you know how to time them correctly it doesnt matter at all if you use extended or normal ones"
Tribes,2wf422,Schreq,-1,Thu Feb 19 13:12:29 2015 UTC,"It is not possible to throw fractals so reliably that they kill the capper with the 1500 damage burst. So while it can happen, and if it does it is annoying, it is not an actual issue since it only happens very rarely.  And against offense the final burst doesn't matter either, because they can see the fractal and therefore won't walk into it."
Tribes,2wf422,thynnmas,2,Thu Feb 19 14:46:21 2015 UTC,"Thinking it's impossible to get reliable last-tick kills with fractals is pretty naive. Nobody put real effort in to it (well, according to qualm xantyr did) and I'm pretty sure after season 3 or 4 nobody was tryhard enough to sperg out about routes so much, that one could call out ETAs of most routes with +/-1 seconds accuracy.  Just as an example: In 1 or 2 cappers vs hof warmups we did, instead of calling capper is on a back 35 out when I saw them start their route, I was giving an exact time of arrival using the in-game clock (e.g. capper hitting our flagstand at 12:43). More often than not I was only off by 1 second, and that's from the moment the capper started. It gets more accurate the closer the capper is to grabbing.  Just because last-tick kills haven't been a real issue until now, doesn't mean it will never be. Ok, it probably won't but that's because nobody is nerdy enough at this point."
Tribes,2wf422,Lowerend,1 point,Fri Feb 20 19:34:33 2015 UTC,"Problem is certain maps for sure. ""they see the fractal?"" Thing is, on maps like DX where hof can hide inside stand, and just pop out when capper comes in, meanwhile roam and snipe can shut down the most. Offense have to get up to the stand, with energy, with health enough to clear hof, spamming fractals are to strong on certain maps and requires no skill what so ever. And your argument about not walk into it, on small stands it's hard to not ""walk"" into it because of the small stands like DX."

Tribes,2wf422,MKRWSeek,2,Thu Feb 19 13:15:13 2015 UTC,"I think the main reason brute is more viable than the other classes simply is its survivability. The strongest spinfusor combined with an amazing secondary PLUS shieldpack. Also not having quickdraw hurts brute the least because with jugg and dmb you have ramp-up time on the chainguns and have to rely more on belt items while dueling. With the removal of fractals, brute would still have better survivability than jugg and dmb. If you want to have those 2 classes played more, you'd have to ban shield pack or super heavy but that would be stupid imo."

Tribes,2wf422,Lowerend,2,Thu Feb 19 16:26:19 2015 UTC,"I think banning fractals is a bad idea. Despite being abused on offense in the way we all know and love, fractals are a really important tool for brt hof. Aside from the shield pack, the main reason to brt hof is to use fractals as aoe denial around your stand. On the flipside, reach -is- banned in EU making hof incredibly easy compared to NA (which I'm used to) so I could be skewed in my thinking. Either way, I think it's a bad idea.   I agree with reducing shrike price. Shrikes usually play a part in excellent offense strategies and offer some variance in the game overall (for o and d).  I think unbanning emp xls is a good idea too. Raider capping is crazy hard but it pays off a lot if you can do it well. I think jammer pack on cappers should be banned imho because I think it's just as bad as inf capping was, if not worse . However, that's just me."

The Brute can almost instant kill with his Spinfusor, which you can easily finish off your target with a nova colt or shotgun. Also the Fusion mortar is insanely powerful.  Also the AP grenades are deadly.  That's about it. You're more likely going to get chained down by people since doing direct hit Spinfusor hits is not as reliable.  Hope this helps."

No. There are no oneshot hitscan weapons in the game like AWP or railgun. The only hitscan weapon in the game does not do enough damage to be able to instakill people.  As other people have mentioned, there are a few weapons in the game that can oneshot you, but that require you to be in a light class and being on the receiving end of a good shot as this weapons are not hitscan and requires experience and timing to get off. And of cores, at times, luck :p"
Tribes,2w96ae,ZtriDer,1 point,Thu Feb 19 09:34:54 2015 UTC,"Well, actually, there's a mechanic that gives a small chance to weapons to instantly kill a guy, whatever health he has left. It only works the first hour of playing, so as a new player you won't notice it, and Hirez supposed the killed guys won't notice it neither since they are noobs aswell. I think it is made so even bad players can get a kill x)"
Tribes,2w96ae,Gaouchos,-2,Wed Feb 18 07:32:12 2015 UTC,"There's Sentinels, which have hitscan sniper rifles with no sway, very similar to the rail gun. Fortunately, it can shoot across the map since every map has tons of visibility and spawns are on top of safe hills. When players spawn and disc jump (which is 95% of players), they make an easy 1 hit kill. Almost.... too easy."
Tribes,2w96ae,Will12239,-1,Wed Feb 18 04:51:21 2015 UTC,"Lights can be one shot by soldiers and brutes with their spinfusors. It takes a crack shot to land a hit, and lights are also the most mobile classes. You'll have a hard time getting instakilled, unless you're up against someone good or lucky.  You can also get install killed as a soldier or a light from a shocklance to the back, but that's sUP3rl33t MLG status (aka some burnt out level 50 who only does crazy trick shots).  To be clear, its very likely that you'll meet quite a few players who are good enough to land spinfusor shots consistently, but compared to every automatic, they're hilariously underpowered/difficult to use  The equivalent to the AWP or any other OP weapon in tribes is hitscan or auto. Against a really good auto user it's impossible to win no matter how good you are at any other non auto/chainable weapon."

Tribes,2w2504,salamander-,1 point,Tue Feb 17 17:11:27 2015 UTC,in regards to that RC game.. It really underscores the importance of a great rep/turret farmer. I was playing HOF for Diamond sword (janitor) and I just couldnt suit up.
Tribes,2w2504,evanvolm,0,Tue Feb 17 01:33:12 2015 UTC,"RC bases are really, really, really shitty to defend.  As someone who has been the repairman for several of these PUGs, the person who designed these bases is a giant cunt.  The solar panels, which are literally the only thing keeping things up and running, are entirely too exposed.  Any weapon can take them out from a distance (besides ELF).  You can spam the blaster from the hills and take them out within seconds if you wanted.    The inside of each base only 1 level and 2 inventories, in which a single mortar can render both unusable.  The forcefields...fuck the forcefields.  At least they're bearable in T2.  The base turrets are entirely useless except in rare cases.  The plasma turret is higher than the ELF, and honestly I think if you switched those things would be better. Let the Plasma turret take care of those below the base, and the ELF can focus on cappers and LO.  The one thing that helps players out when shit hits the fan is if the repair/turret guy placed a few mobile inventories, which are fortunately self-powered.  Sadly, for someone like you they're entirely useless because you can't switch to a heavy armor from them; just get weapons and ammo.  Deployable turrets really wouldn't do much good even if strategically placed, since as I said people can so easily destroy the panels.  So yeah, fuck Rollercoaster if you're on defense.  I don't even know if they made any changes to it in T2 since I never really played it.  Should it be brought back someday, or spiritually revived in Project Z, at the very least it should have a second floor/basement with a generator for backup.  It would make things infinitely better, at least for me."
Tribes,2w2504,ThatDarnRosco,3,Tue Feb 17 02:16:21 2015 UTC,"It's the same for both sides, it's a testament to a snipers accuracy picking off would be rapers, and a farmers persistent repairs and turret/inventory deployments.   To change it would ruin it, it's always a tough base to defend but that's what makes it fun and exciting."
Tribes,2w2504,evanvolm,0,Tue Feb 17 04:28:04 2015 UTC,"I'd hardly label it as fun, for repairmen at least.  Yes, you're constantly doing something.  Repairing, deploying stuff for your team mates, dying, repeat.  Not much room for fun.    Snipers, chasers, and LO probably have a fine and dandy time.  RD is a bit better because getting into the base is harder and has better turret placement options.  Plus, goalies help a lot on that map.  But once it is taken over by a HO or two...gg.  I just thank god deployables are self powered.  Without that it'd be so much worse.  That, and the fact that base assets can function when at least 50% repaired."
Tribes,2w2504,ThatDarnRosco,2,Tue Feb 17 04:37:04 2015 UTC,"I have run farmer on RC many times during the competitive years of Tribes, and I had fun at it. It was never straightforward and easy, you had to make as many judgement calls as those other so called fun positions, I had a blast.   Also if you can't remove a few campers in the RC base, and you find it tedious and boring then it's not the position for you."
Tribes,2w2504,yeum,1 point,Wed Feb 18 01:28:15 2015 UTC,"The invos on RC in T2 are IIRC self-powered, the Solars only keep the shields up. Also T2 solars have shields, tho you can still take them out with continous disc spam (~5 discs). Also the big base turrets are somewhat annoying and difficult to take out without pre-defined spam (small target floating in air + recharging shields).  Stock version has vehicles, but TWL version does not, I guess because Shrikes have a tendency to turn the map into a really terrible shitfest for the offense."
Tribes,2w2504,colblair,0,Tue Feb 17 20:52:31 2015 UTC,"There was a T2 version - it was mostly the same except of course in T2 you have the ability to swap turret types so that was nice (unless someone happened to swap in two mortar turrets). Was a bit harder to base rape if I remember, but not by much... mainly because of shocklances and better deployable turrets"
Tribes,2vzzpx,ArmoredPenguin94,7,Sun Feb 15 20:00:13 2015 UTC,"One suggestion - for your group stage allocate the maps in advance. You've got the most popular maps listed in the poll, just take the 5 most popular maps and use those for the 5 rounds. If you don't then you'll be waiting every time for captains to do map banning (they'll consult their teams, making it slow), and for an admin to pick the map.

It was be awesome if we could include the maximum number of teams possible. I know people may miss check in and that would result in less players. NA has struggled with this concept and I feel everyone should be included if possible. Again thanks a ton for doing this!
Tribes,2vzzpx,Fulled,1 point,Sun Feb 15 21:37:00 2015 UTC,"Of course, if on the day we have more checkins than expected we will tweak things. We'll prepare a 7/8 team scenario.  However in my experience 15-25% of signups don't check in/play. I will be happy if we get 6 teams, but 4-5 is also a real possibilty. I hope I'm wrong and we get 8 teams but I wouldn't count on it."

Tribes,2vzzpx,Coniks,1 point,Tue Feb 17 00:13:01 2015 UTC,"In general the 8th ones are the guys who are last picked, so i personaly prefere to pick a sub who is in mumble when it's needed.  And also, for the prize pool, it will be splited /8 and not /7 so, if this 8th one was usefull, it's ok but if he was'nt it can upset the something . So stay at 7 players/team. Or see that with more people like with an other strawpol."
Tribes,2vzzpx,MKRWSeek,1 point,Tue Feb 17 02:26:16 2015 UTC,"I think we'll see on the day, it depends on player numbers. If possible, we'll try to stay at 7 players per team.

Tribes,2vy3cn,Pumpelchce,0,Mon Feb 16 07:26:41 2015 UTC,"You did enough damage to the shrike just as you capped, and he ran into something and destroyed it, killing himself, giving you the kill, the shrike down and revenge award after you'd respawned. I've seen it  when destroying base assets, and I'll take out a turret almost completely, then get sidetracked, and someone else will give it a finishing shot, and I get the award. Or dueling somebody, and they kill me, and they're almost dead, and drop too far and crater, and I get the kill and an aftermath and revenge award.  From what I could see, the shrike was nowhere near you when you used the nitron to accelerate yourself, so it wasn't you killing the shrike with that nitron."
Tribes,2vy3cn,DigitalBoy760,0,Sun Feb 15 22:59:26 2015 UTC,^ I agree. Similar to damaging a chaser and then they K out a little bit later nowhere near you. You were the last to damage them so you get the kill. The shrike essentially suicided after the capper respawned and started his route. Cool effect tho...like nitron magic

Tribes,2vqhni,vornska,8,Fri Feb 13 15:12:55 2015 UTC,"I really wish that people would stop talking about how HiRez abandoned T:A. The real problem was how they failed to address serious flaws while the game was still in development & post ""release,"" flaws which destroyed the playerbase quickly after it peaked. An abandoned good game is still a good game: it wouldn't have to die. Ascend was dying long before HiRez started trying to euthanize it by wrecking the servers.  Wrel's take is much better than most because he addresses problems with HiRez's relationship to us & the game during development. I think it's a mistake to frame that issue in relation to abandonment however."

Tribes,2vqhni,SudoAlex,1 point,Fri Feb 13 18:14:14 2015 UTC,"As someone who played DAOC (Mythic's previous game before WAR) - I'd say that WAR was just flawed from the start.  A 2 way PvP MMORPG is just asking for trouble. When one side is winning, people on the winning side will stay, more people will are likely to join it, it's easier to get stronger. When one side is losing, people are less likely to stay if they're not having fun, new players aren't keen on joining a losing side, it gets worse. 3 way may have a dominant side - but it's less likely to maintain it for a long period of time.  They kept the formula for capturing a zone a bit of a secret - although it involved taking objectives from tier 3 to help tier 4. So people of lower levels had to help you with locking a zone to be able to continue towards the capital city (although they did offer an alternative to this in a later patch).  They overpromised so much, underdelivered so badly."

I was never arguing for high skill people not to beat on lower skill people, I was always arguing for lower skill people to have a lot more options to contribute to the team, and for the really abusive stuff to have some sort of downside commensurate to its upside.  Think about it this way, take an extremely high skill player (top 1%), and a moderately skilled player (50th percentile). The competitive crowd seemed to argue that the result should be akin to Superman beating down an infant.  Casuals thought it should have been more akin to Superman beating down Booster Gold, same ultimate result but at least somewhat comparable.  Skill needs to determine outcomes, but it should not prevent everyone else from having any fun."
Tribes,2vqhni,jamiemccomb,1 point,Sat Feb 14 20:05:02 2015 UTC,"But the skill curve in Tribes:A isnt punishing at all, it's a fairly easy skill based fps game. I never understood people on this subreddit saying that. The people who are shit at tribes would also be shit at battlefield or planetside, or whatever other shit.   The truth is there were never enough people playing the game at any given time, and not enough money was thrown at the comp scene for it to go anywhere. Not to mention that the game is so unbalanced that I wake up nights screaming, just thinking about it."
Tribes,2vqhni,jamiemccomb,1 point,Mon Feb 16 05:07:44 2015 UTC,"Thats because the pub scene means nothing, if there's money in the comp scene, people will line up to play shitty 64 tick MM with million year long bomb timers, because all the ppl want to feel like they're part of the 'scene'.  I've said it before, there are only two steps to making a succesful competitive fps game.   Make a game that's at least semi balanced (even TA achieved this stage, it doesnt have to be that balanced.)  Throw endless cash at tournaments, streamers, etc. Nothing else matters, and on the scale that valve make games, their pub scene may as well not exist."
Tribes,2vqhni,rgzdev,-1,Mon Feb 16 05:03:10 2015 UTC,Funny that he uses Planetside 2 as an example of a game that isn't dieing after Planetside 2's dev team was almost completely laid off.
Tribes,2vpncv,evanvolm,1 point,Fri Feb 13 00:31:43 2015 UTC,"Nice podcast. Thank you.  Matchmaking, works best - imo - when taking certain relative values like amount of shots per kill or time moved above a certain speed while also capping or grabbing alot, etc.  Just like this an algorhythm might match a probably good capper to a team with probably no capper or only 'slow' cappers, etc.  The difficulty lays within modelling those rule-sets that define a certain role. And of course, the more roles are defined and the more variables a role has, the bigger the need for a bigger playerbase."
Tribes,2vpncv,Pumpelchce,1 point,Fri Feb 13 21:28:51 2015 UTC,"very nice explanation of matchmaking for a tribes type game  pumelchce. I was wonderign the same thing today at work like, I had the most body blocks ad clutch grabs in a 3V3 match, but I had a score of like 3 O and 2 style (so 3 kills and 2 MA's) yet I prevented the most grabs and caps overall. Witch this is my typical role as I'm a terrible aim, but rarely am I an essential part of the team in this role ."
Tribes,2vpncv,Dice-Rolla,1 point,Fri Feb 13 23:39:18 2015 UTC,"For this very case, the algorhythm might 'know' you as a good body blocker (something that is done in D, flag D, not in O usually) and if there are not many players at flag stand area, it might put you into that team. Also map preferences might be stored so have reference of past playstyles map wise and even side wise.  Well. Long speach short: Good Matchmaking is about BIG DATA analysis."

Tribes,2vouoa,socalpk,2,Fri Feb 13 02:55:36 2015 UTC,"What no one agrees or cares to check out the song. lol. I remember thinking this is the perfect theme for the TA community, especially the comp scene unfortunately, when I first played the game. Then over time I felt it was even more perfect!  The attitudes made it really hard to give a crap about playing, until I just accepted it and ignored it. In T1 and T2 I had a team of friends and we stuck together and played with others with a similar mindset...more game less attitude. But TA was full of attitude and really hard to avoid.  TA is a challenging game and can be very frustrating in it's own right, it has minimal support roles for non-twitch or more strategic roles or high ping players, and then loads and loads of attitude topping it off put a lot of players off."

Tribes,2vkfec,Rynex,2,Thu Feb 12 00:32:54 2015 UTC,"An Exception is a particular type of error.  In C++ there are try/catch blocks that are similar in concept to but work differently than an if/else block.  Basically it tries to do the actions in try{} and then if an exception is ""thrown"", you can attempt to gracefully handle the error in the catch{} block.  A UE occurs when an exception is thrown but no handler can accept it.  The specific cause of UE's in T2?  No idea, but that's what UEs actually are."

Tribes,2vkfec,Arcadizz1e,3,Thu Feb 12 10:23:33 2015 UTC,"Best post from DaveG on the TW thread posted:   A few answers to questions I saw since my last post:   Q: What is your biggest regret about your time working on the Tribes franchise?  A: The way it ended. Not being able to tell folks how frustrated I was about the buggy state of the game, having to be the captain going down with the ship, watching the community lose faith in me because I couldn't explain anything, and (without trying to seriously kiss ass here), having to leave the best gaming community it's ever been my privelege to be part of. Tribes Community was riotously creative and a pleasure to work for...especially when paid in beer.  Q: Did you or did you not discuss the possibility of removing skiing from tribes? It always seemd like you were trying to trim back the speed of skiing.  A: No. At no time was there ever a discussion of removing skiing from Tribes. That would be removing one of the chief identifying characteristics of the original and it was NEVER considered. To my knowledge...not even as a joke.  Q: Do you actually think Tribes was ahead of its time. By this I mean no other game even today can compare to its steep learning curve, speed and required skills to really master the game (would explain the small fan base).   A: ""Ahead of its time""...yes. Small-squad action games didn't hit the big time until the Battlefield series capitalized on everything created by the original T1 team. Now it's big business, but back then, Tribes was still trying to convince folks that ""teams are cool"". But as to the learning curve...that tough learning curve is probably what held Tribes back from real success. It's too hard for the average player...and it kind of holds back the ""critical mass"" from occurring in the community. There's just not enough people playing to achieve that wildfire word-of-mouth ""omigodyagottaplaythi s"" kind of effect that the million-plus sellers get due to population density in their multiplayer community. That's the ""consensus thinking"" version of the story. Personally, I just think the right combo of features hasn't been combined around the concept. It's a SKILL GAME...and it should be touted as one with a community grown up around it that worships the superstar. Given a new conceit like that, then you NEED a high-skill, hard-to-master game like Tribes as the central pivot point to make it all work...and that could lead to a new Tribes kind of game again. T2 made motions toward what needed to be done with the integrated community features and the stabs at a more ""sport-like"" atmosphere...but I think it only went a small percentage of the way necessary. Anyway...blah, blah, blah...it's just noise unless I can get someone to pay for it...but I never really stop thinking about it.  Q: Do you think a tribes game will be released in a few years by some major company claiming they invented the next generation of game and the community was ready to add a third dimension (jetpacks, not hovering or anything, plain jetpacks like in Tribes) to their fps'es? All this probably forgetting or barely stating the Tribes serie and simply renaming every item in the game to avoid copying anything?  A: My guess is that folks will shy away from the jetpack conceit until someone figures out a way they feel will capture the same gameplay with a simpler to master interface. Guesswork of course, and making skiing easier would almost certainly not help the gameplay since skill is the key element they'd be taking away with that change, but if someone makes a jetpack game, that's probably how it would come out now.  Q: Have you played T:V extensively?   A: No. Except for one 10-minute stint at the E3 before they released, I have not played it at all. What I recall from the show was: a) pretty, b) the spinfusor was really slow, and c) the vehicles seemed overpowered. I'm sure that all changed by release."

Tribes,2varz1,CallShenanigans,8,Mon Feb 9 14:25:52 2015 UTC,"Short answer: Yes but legally no.  Long answer: The Tribes Ascend Community SDK is able to create a semi functional, not really connectable private server. The official word from Hi-Rez is we can do whatever we want so long as it does not interfere with the revenue stream of Ascend (lol wut?). Because you have to buy gold to pay for custom servers in Ascend any private community server and server OPs would be stuck down with a legal hammer the size of a Greyhound bus. A similar event happened to a Bittah user who was on the verge of successfully patching in custom skins, all progress stopped once the C&D letter came in.  If Ascend is ever to get private servers the official servers must all go down."

I mean a truly community-run game?!? That's fuckin great!   HiRez would never...."
Tribes,2varz1,yeum,2,Tue Feb 10 02:57:02 2015 UTC,"Nope.  Vivendi put up Tribes 2 as a free download some time around the T:V launch, to drum up hype for the series. It was a pure marketing move.   They eventually they ran out of keys required for account creation, though (hoarded by spergs for their smurf accounts), and for a long time the only way to get to play T2 was to pick it up for 5$ from the bargain bin, even though the game theoretically was ""free"".  Eventually they got bored of keeping the toaster that was running the T2 master server up, and announced they'd turn it off for good sometime 2008.  TribesNext was released by Thyth sometime ~2009 after that. It is entirely his own creation, without access to any of the game's actual source code, aside from the regular-plaintext in-game scripts that come with the game and make up a large part of its functions.  The TN patch was intentionally constructed in a way to give the property holders minimum ground to form a litigation case - the game download is the same as the one Vivendi released to the general public ages ago. The TN patch itself is a ""separate piece of work"" which belongs to Thyth. It does not actually modify the game itself directly in any way, but instead somehow (  IIRC ) fools (hooks?) the game to load a ruby interpreter into memory at run-time, on top of which the actual user backend for the new account authentication service was built on.  tl;dr: Vivendi or any other Tribes IP owner never did anything for Tribesnext, other than keeping their greedy hands off it."
Tribes,2varz1,fauxkingping,1 point,Tue Feb 10 09:24:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response--fills in some gaps despite too many hours playing. I would still say that sometimes no action is positive and purposeful; I imagine that if profits were in any way at risk the story would have run differently. I still think the TribesNext project represents some altruism in the gaming community.

Tribes,2va2wy,salamander-,3,Mon Feb 9 17:05:12 2015 UTC,Does anyone go on the pubs anymore? I checked the server list tonight and there were hardly any games running besides some duel stuff.
Tribes,2va2wy,Charlie_Wax,3,Tue Feb 10 05:51:03 2015 UTC,"Is has its active hours, mainly between 6-10pm EST.  And there are only 3 active servers these days; The Community, BR Annihilation, and Argh's Duel."
Tribes,2va2wy,evanvolm,4,Tue Feb 10 06:01:37 2015 UTC,"Okay, cool. I played some duel last night and had a blast. Spent some time earlier tonight flying around Rollercoaster on The Community all by myself. Kind of sad to reflect.

Tribes,2va2wy,Charlie_Wax,1 point,Tue Feb 10 23:38:09 2015 UTC,It was really eerie man. Capping the flag in an empty server. That familiar triumphant .wav sound digging up memories from 15+ years ago. It felt like I was walking around a ghost town or a graveyard.

Tribes,2va2wy,rtcll,1 point,Mon Feb 9 20:44:42 2015 UTC,honestly the only people talking in mumble were 2 defenders from each team  literally that is it  and also fixious I don't even remember you talking at any point
Tribes,2va2wy,imthekingukno,-3,Wed Feb 11 00:16:51 2015 UTC,"this is great, this is a rage post 12+hrs after the games took place, u r real salty and wat not  u need 2 not get worked up, ur not even a top tier player so u shouldnt even be raging in the regard  12v12 base shit pu is not something to get worked up over at all  maybe 8v8 cluster or a higher level 5v5 lt which doesnt exist anymore is a little more justifiable and wat not but a 12v12 base pu is a cluster fuck and hsould be treated as such  we need 2 start 5v5 lt pu again, then u can get on rtcll, dare or opsayos team and have them really make u feel like shit  i kno from experience they broke me a long time ago and now i just accept that i am scum etc"
Tribes,2va2wy,jihad4jesus69,2,Mon Feb 9 23:21:11 2015 UTC,no ur wrong dp he has a right to get mad  all rtcll ever does is whines and cries and says PUT FIXIOUS ON TF MGENAGN  and fixious doesnt want to play tf every fuckin game and i guess he doesnt like cluster and spam maps like dx pub or sb either   that is fine not to like   FUCK YOU
Tribes,2va2wy,rtcll,2,Mon Feb 9 23:23:59 2015 UTC,"actually  i picked fixious and i normally expect him to tf because i seem him TFing even in regular base pubs and I thought he liked it  in this last PU i picked him and told him to TF he sighed so then I said ok nevermind you can play LD  what did I do wrong here? if you never tell me you hate the position you are given and you only want to play something else, what do u expect to happen? idgaf who plays tf it does not matter to me as long as everyone gets picked"
Tribes,2va2wy,imthekingukno,1 point,Wed Feb 11 00:14:40 2015 UTC,"well ya that is kind o fmean of rtcl 2 do this idk y he do this 2 him  fixious if we lt pu i will pick u, then u can show ur weakenesses in lt game and u will learn the hard way justifiably"
Tribes,2va2wy,jihad4jesus69,-1,Mon Feb 9 23:31:42 2015 UTC,no one on the dx or rd team that won was on mumble aside from some losers that wanted to talk about personal real life stuff and make jokes   mumble isn't needed for this game at all and i highly discourage its usage   i never use mumble and i captain the majority of those games   u clearly like this game and play almost every night so whats the reason why you had a terrible time? was it losing? or being stuck in a position you dont like? or the map selections?  if you write what you didnt like specifically people will change it around.
Tribes,2va2wy,DaJ4ck3L,2,Mon Feb 9 21:37:41 2015 UTC,that's actually wrong.
Tribes,2va2wy,evanvolm,1 point,Mon Feb 9 23:33:27 2015 UTC,"if you write what you didnt like specifically people will change it around.    Hardly.  Both because no one in T1 really cares for me or my opinion, and because they won't change things that have become standard over the course of T1's life.  The majority are fine with how PUGs are run, so there's no point in making any changes.  One less person, especially me, won't make a dent in how things are run."
Tribes,2va2wy,StorkSooFly,5,Mon Feb 9 23:53:58 2015 UTC,I'd like to hear what you have to say about the pu's
Tribes,2va2wy,rtcll,1 point,Tue Feb 10 00:39:59 2015 UTC,I am confused at what the issue is
Tribes,2va2wy,jihad4jesus69,-2,Wed Feb 11 00:17:59 2015 UTC,just vocalize what you want done and we'll change it  it might seem like we are all scummy but aside from rtcll and pedophile crow most of us are just joking about being scum and don't take it seriously   i too dont like the standardized map pool or sticking someone to one position so having another voice would be good   you would be surprised how much 1 persons voice does matter
Tribes,2va2wy,DaJ4ck3L,2,Tue Feb 10 00:18:24 2015 UTC,"The rd team had lots of communication on mumble. DX was the only map that lost with mumble communication.   Also me and Fixious are cool. You can't joke about being scum when you really are scum. Your posts here are literally the first normal posts I've ever seen from you. I never did anything wrong to you from the start, and yet you felt the need to attack me. You have without a doubt one of the most fucked up personalities I've ever seen in Tribes."
Tribes,2va2wy,DaJ4ck3L,1 point,Tue Feb 10 01:55:51 2015 UTC,"Though I think our defense which did have mumble communication wasn't the problem. But out of the 5 maps, the team with mumble communication won 4 of them. Not to mention the team with more voice communication has a way better W/L ratio out of all the pu's played so far. This is why voip is such a common thing now days."

Tribes,2v6nmm,Shaeress,1 point,Mon Feb 9 00:50:26 2015 UTC,"It's even funnier since that platform doesn't have any collision. Even if you do manage to jump all the way over there, you can't land on it."
Tribes,2v6nmm,Radmite,1 point,Sun Feb 8 13:03:59 2015 UTC,Isn't there a way to call an inventory station on the platform to give yourself something to stand on?  I'm almost certain I've seen that before.
Tribes,2v6nmm,CallShenanigans,1 point,Sun Feb 8 15:12:09 2015 UTC,"There is no collision on the platform, so I'd guess not"
Tribes,2v6nmm,Shaeress,6,Sun Feb 8 15:22:39 2015 UTC,"I checked it out and it seems like that particular platform is surrounded by a field of instant death and while you can call inventory stations down on it they disappear after just a couple of seconds.  The other platforms, however, don't have collision, don't cause insta-death (except for the lowest one that's under the fall death limit) and can be covered in inventory stations as expected. You can even get an inventory station to stand on on the giant thing in the sky.  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12053509/airarena1.png https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12053509/airarena2.png  To clarify, the troll face [VGB] platform does cause instant death, but none of the other platforms do."

Tribes,2v6nmm,shazface,2,Sun Feb 8 16:31:55 2015 UTC,"AFAIK, from a long time ago if you called it offline then you could actually land on it. I just have a vague memory of landing on it and surviving, I might be wrong. I'll head on later today and check. Watch this space for updates. :)"

Tribes,2uusld,FM4k,11,Thu Feb 5 08:50:44 2015 UTC,"So, here's a little history lesson!  Dynamix was it's own company, which was owned by Sierra. Around 00-01, Sierra was bought by Vivendi and underwent some pretty aggressive restructuring, which basically fired a majority of the original Tribes 1/2 team, who then went on to form Garage Games (who then built the Torque Game Engine, built off of the original Tribes 2 engine source).  As it stands currently, there's 5 potential avenues for a new Tribes title coming out:  1) Sierra (who's now owned by Activision-Blizzard) buys back the rights from Hirez. This is unlikely, as it was ultimately Sierra who sold the rights off in the first place 4 or 5 years ago to GarageGames (who then sold them to HiRez);  2) GarageGames buys back the rights from HiRez, though this is also unlikely, as, again, they sold the rights;  3) HiRez makes a new tribes title. This is probably not a possibility, either, since HiRez's business model focuses on ""Low input, High output"" games, which first-person shooters cannot be;  4) Somebody builds a Tribes clone on top of a modern gaming engine (like HiRez did);  5) Someone builds a Tribes rebuild on top of the original Darkstar engine (which has been floating around for a few years now). The code is old, but obviously solid (and, at this point, very documented) - It would require insane volumes of work, but would yield the most ""true to source"" product."
Tribes,2uusld,evanvolm,6,Thu Feb 5 15:39:31 2015 UTC,"Slight correction: IAC bought GargageGames in 2007, and were the ones who sold Tribes to Hi-Rez in 2010.  GG had no real say in the matter, and weren't even GG at the time.  After they separated from IAC they became GG again.  So, it's possible they could have interest in acquiring the Tribes title again, but of all the options you provided, #4 is the most likely to happen."
Tribes,2uusld,FM4k,1 point,Thu Feb 5 19:12:13 2015 UTC,"Ah, you're right! Apologies on that :)  And yeah, #4 is most likely to happen... though I secretly wish for #5 almost constantly."
Tribes,2uusld,jihad4jesus69,1 point,Thu Feb 5 19:25:55 2015 UTC,it'd be cool if #5 came true and they just upgraded the lighting or graphics engine or whatever and a few of the things that make it crash from too many explosions in mods
Tribes,2uusld,FM4k,1 point,Thu Feb 5 21:38:30 2015 UTC,"It's certainly possible :) You can buy the old T1 source code for around $300 if I remember correctly? There's some shady guy who was selling it off - forgot where to find 'em, though."

Tribes,2uusld,madman55,3,Thu Feb 5 09:20:18 2015 UTC,"No one can ever make a good tribes and make people happy. T1 was an accident. And nothing will ever make these players happy again. Dynamix made T1 it was garbage but the community stitched it together, discovered exploits, turned them into a game. Then Dynamix tried to make T2 and the community just made mods to put it back like T1. If the damn company who made the game and started it all cannot make people happy lol WTF can? What gamers never seem to realize is there was no fucking great plan its all a moronic evolutionary accident. The only way for another great game like tribes to ever happen again is for some totally unrelated company to go in and make something with out even thinking about tribes, another accident. Sadly most of you will shun it. Tribes was a great game but it was very simple shit that made it great unfortunately the people here in this community cannot let go of all the millions of things that didn't matter in the game. Because people obsess over every detail they will never be able to build a simple beautiful base game that can be the start of something new and great. T1 creators didn't even know about skiing, it wasn't in the game by design. Think about it. How can people whom are such shitty coders they leave a bug like that in the game purposely design something better?  Honestly if you wanted to bank on a company bank on Valve, they are pretty similar, wonky games with broken balance but valve does one thing right, they leave the game open and modifiable enough that the community is free to make a game better or strait up ruin it."

If they did re-acquire Tribes then you can bet they either hammer ""HD"" re-releases of the old titles for minimal effort that would go nowhere or they would butcher it and turn it into a Titanfall clone with everything being auto-aiming hitscan scrubguns."
Tribes,2uusld,Troutsicle,2,Thu Feb 5 22:57:34 2015 UTC,Sierra only ever owned the rights to the game. The only project they fully controlled was T:V  which did terrible after they had Irrational Games produce it for them. T1 and t2 were done by Dynamix which later partially reofrmed as GarageGames and took a 2nd shot at the series in the form of Legions:Overdrive. Sierra is the shitty company that shitcanned Dynamix to save some of their own shitty jobs when Vivendi told them to have some layoffs.
Tribes,2uusld,THEM0RNlNGW00D,2,Fri Feb 6 00:14:41 2015 UTC,Has there ever been precedence of a game company doing this?  My fear is that the only way that Tribes is going to get the exposure that it needs to be successful to the general public is to dumb it down for a console. CoD+Z

Anybody could name themselves anything, and they could install the game on any PC they wanted (including work, school, etc).  t2 sold ~450k copies and that was in 2001-2004 so pretty popular for a niche game. It was the most financially successful tribes despite its poor launch due to being forced out (to release in q1 (thanks Sierra)) 2 months before the dev team wanted to release it.  t:v sold like 40k copies in the first few months and maybe 60k total. It wa sa complete failure both financially and as a product."

If it is the passion of the developers to make a game more similar to T2, then it's not really anyone's right to tell them what they can and can't do.  However, if more people want a T1-like game than T2, and the devs don't listen, then they shouldn't be surprised if the game is not well received for that reason.  Also, you never mentioned how many copies T1 actually sold, just how many people ended up playing it.  What's the source on all of this?"

It was highly modable and had pretty lengthy dev support, and by the time the devs left, there were enough community members who knew the ins and outs of the code to keep fixing bugs and adding features.  what those of us who played t1 remember fondly was quite a bit different from the original shipped game due to the changes.  the player base was HUGE and constantly saw fresh blood due to the lack of drm.  I got it for free from my cousin before eventually buying the game just to have the case/book/etc.  i have lost and downloaded the game countless times over the years without issue as a result."
Tribes,2uwyre,bugsprae,1 point,Thu Feb 5 23:41:37 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, The CLQ.  I remember being super proud of a score I had on that once."
Tribes,2uwyre,perroTW,2,Fri Feb 6 15:11:19 2015 UTC,"The numbers you mentioned for T1 and T2 don't match my memory.  T1 appears to have sold 210k copies, T2 sold 400k as this article seems to state.  You're correct in that T2 didn't reach millions of users, but 400k sales in 2001 is pretty decent and double sales of T1.  Anecdotally, I would argue that most people aren't referencing Tribes 1 due to my personal experience at trade shows and general conversations with Tribes players.  I know pirating was big in Tribes (and also the Demo, which a silly number of people played extensively), but I'd like to see your numbers on that ""6 million reached"" figure (which is just shy of total Halo 2 unit sales in NA)."
Tribes,2uwyre,bolunez,1 point,Fri Feb 6 00:09:02 2015 UTC,"the t1 demo was insanely popular and even though it only had 3 maps (raindance, fog of war, and some C&H map I don't remember), it was otherwise the full game and had dozens of active teams who would take over servers and play each other.  Some ok later base teams transitioned as full teams from demo (5000, ESA, ANGEL, etc) and a lot of those members ended up being LT bigshots like Chump.  Lots of good full game players also played demo on occasion just to shit on newbs."
Tribes,2uwyre,Rynex,1 point,Tue Feb 10 22:48:14 2015 UTC,"The amount of piracy in T1 is why nobody wants to make a moddable Tribes game.  I think that the right route would be a DRM free version with support for (preferably server side) mods.   To combat piracy, require an account to play. Anyone without an account can still play, but not on modded servers and they only get a basic load out."

Tribes,2uppf9,mukhtar12345678,1 point,Wed Feb 4 19:57:34 2015 UTC,no the hitbox is MUCH MUCH for spotting because you don't lose any frames while doing it and it's just so obvious where shit is.
Tribes,2uppf9,Rynex,0,Wed Feb 4 22:20:10 2015 UTC,ya but that would also mean that injecting the 0ping nova shit is also equal to blatant hacking (which is really what it) but barely anyone in this community believes so :/  the thing with the hitbox thing is that things like that generally arise in most games if you look hard enough.  in toxikk if you pressed f8 it supposedly gave you wallhacks tho fortunately it was patched out a few hours after the discovery.  it's been over a year since the discovery toggle boxing yet hirez still hasn't done anything although it isn't really their fault; i never expected them to do anything about it anyway.

It's true, I was in spectate, It's true I was telling someone to do a different strategy.   My only defense here is that what I was asking them to do is the exact same thing I would have said had I been watching a cast or listening to their comms in the channel. I wasn't saying anything like ""capper back in 30"" and if anyone has the match recorded then I'm sure you'd gladly back that up. I'm sure some spergs took screenshots.   I've never used any enhancements to ""beat"" anyone , ever beyond enhancing my ini for performance only. Which to be totally honest most of the time was a fucking liability in visibility I traded for frames  Don't dare try to tarnish me that way, if anything I've done some amazing things with HUGE handicaps in ping,  hardware, mice, and framerate, monitors etc.   It is pathetic really and I have zero respect for anyone that had to enhance their game with hacks to be able to 'hang' with competitive players. That makes the person doing it a pathetic person IN REAL LIFE.   I may have done a lot of things wrong in my tribal career, but I always respected the spirit of competition too much to ever stoop that low. I would only ever stoop as low as poaching players, or gaming the map pool. I'd happily admit that.   So fuck you. Scumbag.

You can't deny that blitz has done a lot for the game, whether it was trying to perfect macro strategies like 5o, Play4RealSports, and inciting other continents to hate on him (lol euros), or calling other people out mstarr style,. Wouldn't have had it any other way."
Tribes,2uppf9,jamiemccomb,5,Wed Feb 4 21:19:45 2015 UTC,"ok but blitz worded his side of the story as the nice guy who made an honest mistake and then completely switched subjects to further attack kOut.  But he still cheated and it pretty much cost us the match.  The score for the match ended up being 2-1 for the 3 maps, so that map was pretty much the deciding factor and his ""accident"" helped them out in the win since we were actually winning that map.  I cant deny that blitz has done some things for the game, but that's all in the past.  Now he's just can't stop gloating of his past accomplishments and is just a dick to what's left of the na pugs. It's great that he's won all those tournaments but you don't have to state them in every single reddit post and then say your better than every other team.  Blitz just wishes it was 3 years ago where he could run his shitty routes and can't accept the fact that players are better than him now. One of the reasons he attacks people from kOut and then says they cheat but I guess he's just delusional or people are so ignorant of these hacking videos.  If you want the real Blitz cheating drama story I can write it out but idc really."

Tribes,2uppf9,rtcll,5,Fri Feb 6 05:55:39 2015 UTC,"kOut can only report what they saw. You also said elsewhere that you meant to send it in a private message...which means you could easily have been giving enemy positions, etc in other PMs. There is a reason that NATL matches were only supposed to be 14 players + casters/admins, and that is exactly why.   Obviously only you and whoever you meant to message are the only ones who truly know what was actually contained in those messages, but if I were a tourney admin and saw something like that, innocuous as it may have been, I wouldn't hesitate to make you forfeit the map, if not the match entirely.   Try to look at this from an objective point of view. If you saw somebody from Tao or Denial who was clearly not supposed to be in the server message their team, how would you react?"

You guys are jumping to conclusions when you don't know shit, and are forgetting about the actual cheaters who energy hacked(hotwire), 0ping colted(will remain nameless, no proof), orbitaled(tastyham, ACD cappers...), warpy lag inducing cappers(every capper ever), spectated and told his team what to do(fucking buhlitz), and boxed(never any proof) during tournaments/scrims.

Hell I installed [...] hack [...] does that brand me a cheater[?]   Yes. Especially when there's legitimate, built-in ways to do that on a roam map.   There is a huge difference between cheating in pugs/tournaments and cheating outside of them.   What difference is that? One ruins a subset of the community (comp players) and one ruins the subset of the community (all active players). They're both despicable.   I mean I remember cappers abusing speed cheats in private servers to test routes/rock bounces. Does that mean he [sic] is a cheater?    I believe this would also make them cheaters, but playing alone is another matter entirely, so I won't delve into that.   Or new snipers using boxes in scrims when both teams agree its ok, so he can learn where to look to spot.   This is a grey area (when both teams agree). It's not a ""hack"" (just an unpatched exploit), so I can't just say that it's straight up bad (such as using aimbots in a private match even when both teams agree; that's wrong). Encouraging people to ever use boxes to spot is just stupid. That said, I don't think a scrim of this nature has ever been done. I can't imagine agreeing to both teams using an exploit that literally breaks competitive play. 1v1 (sniper vs capper) training... maybe? But if you're 1v1 training the capper can just tell the sniper where the route sets up and his location at all times. Spot (L-Alt) is already very generous (even after nerfs). This is how snipers since the dawn of T:A practiced spotting/shooting outside of matches, and it works very well for learning route setups and where to plink cappers. I should know, I trained at least 5 different snipers while playing on Ego and all of them ended up top tier snipers (some already were, but you get the jist).   You guys are jumping to conclusions when you don't know shit, and are forgetting about the actual cheaters [snip].   Uh, no we aren't, lol. Have you seen the posts above where its basically Blitz vs Everybody? Hacking, cheating, exploiting, you're all fucks.

Tribes,2uppf9,pard0n99,-3,Fri Feb 6 17:57:06 2015 UTC,"Yes. Especially when there's legitimate, built-in ways to do that on a roam map.  There is a legit way to have infinite energy on roam maps? Not even spectator mode goes that high in the map, infinite energy hack can make honor dueling very fun.  What difference is that? One ruins a subset of the community (comp players) and one ruins the subset of the community (all active players). They're both despicable.  No one was cheating in pugs or pub or tournament he was just dicking around in warmup, and your blowing this way out of proportion.  AngryPolak is a great person whom I have respected and known for over a year.  He would never cheat vs people unless he had a very good reason.  It's not a ""hack"" (just an unpatched exploit), so I can't just say that it's straight up bad (such as using aimbots in a private match even when both teams agree; that's wrong).  First, how is using aimbot when both teams agree its ok wrong?  Man you have some really weird morals/ideas.  This scenario would in no way hurt anyone, infact Blizzard designed an open Battle.net in Diablo II where players could hack their balls off with no repercussions and they knew that in no way did this hacking hurt anyone.  It was a very good place to hack and try out new builds to see if they were any good/worked before you spent time making them in the closed battle.net servers where hackers were banned etc.  Second how can you not say hit boxes are straight up bad lol wtf???  They are straight up bad and break the game regardless if they are a hack or exploit.    That said, I don't think a scrim of this nature has ever been done.  How do you know?  I specifically remember iHunted playing with this idea and suggesting it to new blood snipers who needed help spotting.  Your method of training a sniper abuses an in game mechanic( slowly spamming L-Alt) that was probably never intended to be as powerful as it was but its ok because its in the game?  Even though we as a community ban things that are in the game because we believe Hirez fucked up and made thing op.  Who is to say spamming l-alt is not op putting it right beside hitboxes as a exploit.    To quote JimChrist regarding cheaters: [...] as far as I am concerned you're [all] fucking loser[s].   If Jim said this he disappoints me too grouping people together, labeling them all losers cuz some people dick around in cheats that don't harm anyone.  Cheats fucking exist you can't make them dissappear and pretty much anyone can get there hands on them.  Using them against people in competition when they are explicitly banned is wrong, simple.  But that is not what happened in this event."

Not even spectator mode goes that high in the map, infinite energy hack can make honor dueling very fun.   Yes. Changing classes refills energy. This is how cappers quickly spam thrusts to get back in position and how Dodgepong took his map overlays from the skybox as infiltrator.   No one was cheating in pugs or pub or tournament he was just dicking around in warmup, and your blowing this way out of proportion. AngryPolak is a great person whom I have respected and known for over a year. He would never cheat vs people unless he had a very good reason.   I know he's a good guy, but you can't start classifying people who only cheat in pubs as good people. Once you know someone cheats, you can't know when they are and aren't cheating. All of their credibility is thrown out the window.   [Blizzard creates special game servers for hacks]   Tribes does not have special game servers for hacks. You can't just say pubs are a stomping ground because they aren't ""real games."" They're ""real games"" to everyone who doesn't play pugs.   how is using aimbot [...] wrong?   Using hacks, ever, lowers the value of honest practice and honest players. You won't find CS teams scrimming with ESP.   Second how can you not say hit boxes are straight up bad lol wtf???   Boy you changed your mind quickly on that subject. They are bad, but I specifically meant in the context of both teams agreeing on something. I still don't think it's smart, because it's cheating like anything else. Thus a gray area.   I specifically remember iHunted playing with this idea and suggesting it to new blood snipers who needed help spotting.   I started ignoring Hunted's ideas about these things after he admitted using the exploit against teams who did not agree in advance. Encouraging the use of exploits/cheats, even in private servers, pubs, and other non-comp environments is a straight up slippery slope and Hunted is the proof. Of course the biggest proponent of this kind of training is the one who has already admitted to using it, as a way to legitimize his cheating to win in scrims and possibly matches.   Your method of training a sniper abuses an in game mechanic( slowly spamming L-Alt) that was probably never intended to be as powerful as it was but its ok because its in the game?    Yes. It's built in the game and is known to be intended because the developers intentionally modified it to be weaker than the original spot area. The original spot area was significantly larger, and after the community complained on the forums, it was fixed and the community was significantly happier with the new spotting system. Since you say spamming spot is already ""broken,"" why would we need a mechanic that is definitely not intended that is inherently more broken to train? This whole argument was really badly put together.   Who is to say spamming l-alt is not op putting it right beside hitboxes as a exploit.   The devs that put it in the game and the community that worked hard to have it corrected to a point where it was considered balanced.   Cheats fucking exist you can't make them dissappear and pretty much anyone can get there hands on them. Using them against people in competition when they are explicitly banned is wrong, simple. But that is not what happened in this event.   Using cheats is wrong PERIOD. Why do you think using cheats is EVER a good thing? Especially cheats that aren't ""balance changes"" like magic chain. Infinite energy, ESP, aimbots, triggerbots, why are we putting up with any of this shit, ever?  This is the stuff that kills games. Stop whitewashing cheaters, even innocuous ones.  Jim quote"

Using hacks, ever, lowers the value of honest practice and honest players.  What does that have to do with anything,  where do you have the right to tell people they can't hack in a private server vs other people who agree it is ok in this hypothetical example.  You took my Blizzard example way out of context good job. No one said hacking in pubs is ok lol where are you getting this shit?    Like you said magic chain is an inject which makes it a hack which makes us all hackers if you want to follow some sort of righteous strict definition of the term hacker.  Your saying spamming l-alt is balanced?  Its stupid and I easily get bullshit spots with it even after the nerf.  Boxes would be a much better training tool because it would show you exactly all the high points/ view points of any route on any map quickly and efficiently w/o someone having to talk you through it constantly.  I would be fine with people training with it; it is just sad that we could never get it perm disabled for actual comp games, like say a server option (boxes on/boxes off).  Using cheats is wrong PERIOD. Well like you said magic chain and colt inject are cheats.  Infinite energy, ESP, aimbots, triggerbots, why are we putting up with any of this shit, ever?  The only valid example there is infinite energy.  Your definitely struggling to twist this argument the wrong way.  We are not putting up with any ESP, aimbots, or triggerbots lol.  Most people including myself despise hitboxers in any sort of comp BUT ironically, incase you forgot, it was Jim Christ who allowed hitboxing and flash to be legal (though frowned upon) in comp because he had no way to police it."

Tribes,2uk0r2,Schreq,2,Tue Feb 3 04:54:49 2015 UTC,"It's not off. It's occupying half of the absolute center   or slightly more than it because the diameter of the lines are an odd number, while resolutions are an even number.

I don't claim to be a good player (far from it) but on my time I've seen some brilliant ones doing incredible stuff in this game. Unlike all the call of duty, battle fields and alike, this game required a a very special sort of skill and for that it stands out from most fps games nowadays. I'll miss it very much!  This video is just to remember some of the best moments in the game, its not even carefully edited, it is what it is or what it was! Cheers!"

Tribes,2u8d0a,Nark51,1 point,Fri Jan 30 20:24:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, here is the one you mentioned and a couple of others:  http://youtu.be/QVU6zPkkeZM?t=7m57s  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiVQ3wYm5kc  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uzl9u6kptQ  I had a few more non-shit ones that I never made videos of, unfortunately. And I play the game so sporadically in pubs now that I doubt I can pull them off anymore. Most of what Raider capping is are just Soldier routes with a modified setup to take grenade launcher/blackout jumping into account, because they are not on-contact explosives like the Spare Spinfusor. Crossfire is a very good map for adapting Pathfinder and Soldier routes into Raider, because 98% of it is rockbouncing with very little energy management.  The benefits of this are being able to use the jammer pack for a route that can be pretty much invisible (in the case that you don't get marked by a random spot-tap) on some maps (such as Sunstar or Blue Shift) or using the shield pack on a return route to give you a much higher chance of getting home alive in medium."

Tribes,2u40vi,SerEaglee,2,Thu Jan 29 20:05:02 2015 UTC,The drafts I played in so far usually had the following timeline:  12:00 CET: Sign-in  15:00 CET: Picking  16:00-21:00 CET: Games  I'm guessing we'll have it similar to that unless there's complaints.

Tribes,2u40vi,ArmoredPenguin94,1 point,Thu Jan 29 20:18:34 2015 UTC,"well, depending on the signups we can have sign-in/picking start later if we have less ppl. (meaning less games)"
Tribes,2u40vi,angrypolak1,1 point,Thu Jan 29 20:49:43 2015 UTC,Why do u guys start so early anyway? Games and picking usually only last 4 hours at most  from what I've seen.
Tribes,2u40vi,ArmoredPenguin94,1 point,Thu Jan 29 21:59:11 2015 UTC,"we don't start that early, at 3-4 PM usually. And that's because picking/looking for extra captains always takes too long.   the 12:00 sign-in used to be only checking a box on Gameshrine to confirm you were attending, you didn't actually need to be in mumble until the end of the picking process (unless you were an admin or a captain)  We haven't actually discussed a set time yet."
Tribes,2u40vi,sheepieee,1 point,Thu Jan 29 22:07:32 2015 UTC,This is not the normal timeline... you seem to have saturday and sunday mixed together. 12:00 CET sign-ins are complete 13:00 CET Picking 14:00 CET games start.  Games start later on sundays though as no picking

Tribes,2u1d40,Solinium,2,Thu Feb 5 09:09:54 2015 UTC,They have stated that the game will support custom maps.  Outside of that they've been fairly standoffish regarding modding.  I too am very supportive of modding and realize it made Tribes what it was.  It can prolong the life of any game indefinitely if it has a large enough (and dedicated) playerbase.

Tribes,2u1d40,qhp,1 point,Thu Jan 29 21:02:29 2015 UTC,That's a good point. I think a little inheritance feels good though. 0% feels too slow in a game as fast as tribes
Tribes,2u1d40,spleeeem,1 point,Thu Jan 29 06:24:27 2015 UTC,0% feels too slow in a game as fast as tribes   Agreed. I also (personally) think that 1-99% feel too slow for a game as fast as tribes :~)  But I know that people like not seeing still plates floating in the air and stuff so I'm not arguing too much now.
Tribes,2u1d40,wordthompsonian,1 point,Thu Jan 29 06:27:48 2015 UTC,"I've always found the ""floating disk"" argument to be completely asinine and just plain silly.  First off it's incredibly tough to do, it's not like it's something you'd see every game, or ever.  People goofing off with the Blinksfusor specifically to do this take a ridiculous amount of time to get it right, and that's without concern for placement, timing, or generally making the thing useful at all.  And even then any and all problems it would present are completely circumvented by the fact that disks have a lifespan.  It lasts for a couple seconds at best, then just harmlessly explodes, you'd always be better off just shooting someone directly.  Sorry I know you said you don't want to argue and here I am arguing.  I really don't think there'd be any problems whatsoever if they just straight-up had a slider when you customize your loadout to set your inheritance."

Tribes,2u1d40,qhp,1 point,Thu Jan 29 13:39:05 2015 UTC,0% is preferable in any situation that isn't chasing.
Tribes,2u1d40,AFireInAsa,1 point,Thu Jan 29 18:03:43 2015 UTC,"Only because aerial movement in T:A is too difficult to manipulate, forcing ground ADAD battles. With directional jets (as this game will have, I imagine) air combat becomes longer and more difficult to predict. At this point, I'd prefer having 100%.  Watching Legions you'll see many more air-based duels, with great air control with directional jets."
Tribes,2u1d40,Mabeline,1 point,Thu Jan 29 21:04:17 2015 UTC,Wouldn't 0 inheritance go exactly where you're aiming at the time you pull the trigger?
Tribes,2u1d40,qhp,3,Thu Jan 29 08:00:23 2015 UTC,"Yes (it also always travels at the same velocity relative to the map). This is how most games with projectiles (quake, TF2, Firefall, BF, etc.) handle inheritance because it's easier to code."
Tribes,2u1d40,eject_eject,3,Thu Jan 29 08:02:39 2015 UTC,Because it's easier to play with in those games.*
Tribes,2u1d40,qhp,5,Thu Jan 29 16:21:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seriously. The velocity inheritance code is actually 4 lines of code including comments and serialization annotations.  You really don't want to play with 0% in Tribes, it's totally awful if you're moving at any appreciable speed, even if the projectile is really fast.  Proj and I tested this at some point with the chaingun in TAC (which was something like 2x faster than T:A bullets already) and I switched it to 100% after like 3 tries at chasing because it was so obviously and incredibly terrible."
Tribes,2u1d40,eject_eject,2,Thu Jan 29 19:23:15 2015 UTC,True.
Tribes,2u1d40,KoboldCommando,1 point,Thu Jan 29 20:29:59 2015 UTC,Seems like less of a challenge in some respects. It would be much easier to hit that bastard sniper while you're trying to run a flag route
Tribes,2u1d40,prettzl,1 point,Thu Jan 29 15:27:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, but then in high speed situations you're at a serious disadvantage. If you are moving and your target is moving instead of figuring out your targets movement relevant to your own (easy to do) you have to figure out your targets movement relevant to the map (hard to do, especially if your target is in the air)."
Tribes,2u1d40,Pumpelchce,1 point,Thu Jan 29 18:41:37 2015 UTC,That's definitely a tradeoff. I'll opt for a toggle button.
Tribes,2u1d40,Zwitterions,1 point,Thu Jan 29 22:54:53 2015 UTC,"I agree, this would be ideal.  In fact it would play right into the customizable loadouts!  0% inheritance is really nice for peppering a base, but a pain if you're trying to chase someone down, and vice versa for 100%, being able to swap them out could really help distinguish your role/specialization."

Tribes,2u220b,cowcaddens,2,Fri Jan 30 09:57:10 2015 UTC,It's the most important rating out of all of them.
Tribes,2u220b,gurowizard,2,Fri Jan 30 10:16:24 2015 UTC,"http://puu.sh/fdQO7/792716cc76.png  2 ""algorithms"", both with anti-stack:   best first, ie. the player with the highest skill points for a given role will be chosen first. This usually leads to players being put in a role they don't actually play (eg. dodge in HOF, mysterion in offence, etc). 1 work around is to simply set the skill points of a role to 0 if the player does not actually play that role (regardless of how good they are). That way an LD like mysterion wouldn't be considered for offence, or dodge for HOF. skill first. It sorts players in accordance to their best skill in comparison to their total skill and then picks from there. ie. Funks has a high cap/total skill % and hence is picked for that role, despite not being one of the top 2 cappers in roles. This is a better picking process as players are picked depending on their strengths in a certain role. This also allows more high skilled versatile players to fill out other positions, eg. by putting scandium as capper in BE (instead of snowy who has a cap skill of 10), we can then put snowy into HOF where he has a skill of 8.   there's also some extra stuff like randomized role picking orders just to add variation in roles (mostly so the program doesnt pick the exact same teams when the same 14 players are playing)  tl;dr - make your points system more accurate (maybe upto 100 instead of 10) and get better data"
Tribes,2u220b,AvianIsTheTerm,1 point,Fri Jan 30 06:15:51 2015 UTC,"That second idea is particularly interesting. I'm not sure exactly how to incorporate it, but (role skill / total skill) sounds like a useful metric to consider.  And yeah, some randomness is a super important goal for any algorithm this uses; it's useless if it just picks the same teams every time.  As to the points system, the main problem I see with increasing the granularity of the ratings (e.g. to 100 instead of 10) is that doing so makes judgements more difficult and arbitrary.  For instance: it's hard enough trying to decide what criteria makes a '7' ranked HoF better than a '6' ranked HoF... but what criteria makes a '66' ranked HoF better than a '65' ranked HoF?  I mean, I guess the skill ratings are always subjective up to a point, but if you increase the precision at which players are rated, you have to make sure you can determine skill levels with enough accuracy."

I like it, but there are definitely days where people are a lot betterworse than they usually are.   Neat idea. Could implement a way to pick for off roles, or if one person wants to play a specific position. But then you would need each player to fill out a small survey and they would need to update that information whenever you want the bot to recalculate. Pretty doable though.   Make a website, and have all active pug players make an account and set preference of roles.   Have a couple admins who would be in charge of assigning numerical values to each player.  Thing about that is the admins would have to actually be unbiased in their decisions.   It's cool though.   EDIT: I didn't actually look at the code before I made previous comment. I have now. Wtf this looks flawed as fuck. I mean, I get what it does but the logic makes no sense to me. I'm really tired so I can't explain myself properly.

Tribes,2u220b,AvianIsTheTerm,3,Thu Jan 29 08:33:11 2015 UTC,It's more of a tool to get things going. See in AU people complain if the teams are stacked each time and we sort it out from there.

Tribes,2u220b,SudoAlex,2,Thu Jan 29 11:06:02 2015 UTC,"I think it's extremely hard to come up with something that ranks players as accurately as possible. You can't really take something like points or k/d into consideration without tracking separate role specific stats. So determining who had what of an impact to a victory is next to impossible.  One can only dream of an in-game point system that actually makes sense and represents peoples performance. Combine that with a proper stats api or the ability to make mutators using the TCP-Link class. I'm looking at you ProjectZ :D  GReaper, how did your pug stats worked back in the day and what rating system did you use? I guess it was just based on team scores?!"
Tribes,2u220b,Schreq,3,Thu Jan 29 14:15:15 2015 UTC,"It was just me testing trueskill - everyone on the winning team gaining points, everyone on the losing team losing points.  One post which interested me in this not too long ago was Zen and the Art of Balancing a Lobby, based on TF2 pickup stats. The same guy has created http://beta.tf2playerrankings.com/ since then.  But yeah - to get anything half decent out of it you need more stats, especially class/role stats. For T:A trying to get this data is insanely difficult due to the number of classes and positions, the fact that it's CTF just makes things more fiddly. If I'm soldier defence one map, then switch to soldier offence the next - there's absolutely nothing which we can scrape to detect this, and manual reporting just isn't effective enough."
Tribes,2u220b,zombieofthepast,2,Thu Jan 29 17:13:02 2015 UTC,"That link seems to be an interesting read, thank you, will read it later.  I think a tribes-like ctf game is a really special case and with what we have available in T:A for example, basing a rating system around wins and losses, is the only thing you can do.  In most other games it's a bit easier, simply because frags or how often you died has more weight to it than in tribes ctf. In such games, more often than not being on top of the scoreboard also means you played best. Edge cases like TF2 medic is also easier to solve when taking points healed and deaths into consideration. Of course there will be situations where the stats you have are too broad to make a detailed analysis of ones performance and it would probably fail to detect clutch plays, but it's still much better than the problem of not knowing the role of somebody in tribes ctf.  The only solution I can come up with, is a very detailed points system. Almost like achievements in other games like ""kill a sentinel while he is shooting your capper"" or ""get a conc while you are the last remaining player on D (certain radius)"". Those then categorized by role. You need a lot of those for most of the plays you can do in every role and give certain points for it. If you then could access detailed stats about gained points, split by role/category, you should be able to have role specific rankings. Edit: Pretty much just the hirez accolade system beafed up and balanced properly.  Now I'm actually really curious how ProjectZ will tackle that problem for their match making."
Tribes,2u220b,thynnmas,1 point,Thu Jan 29 19:07:25 2015 UTC,"In TA PUGs consistency is huge for most roles. Unless you are a capper. Hitting 80%+ of chain will make you a god at LD+O, even if your timing isn't perfect. It's like you need something to determine how well you do before your capper comes in within like 15 seconds of the capper coming in. For both LD, snipe and O. HOF would probably come down to how little damage you take and how consistent your stopping ability is which could be based on accolades for flag defender. It's too difficult to implement unless someone bothers to work on the SDK again."

You also get flag defender for killing offense near the stand and (I think) killing flag carriers anywhere (standoffs), so you'd have to to take that into account when crunching the numbers (maybe have kills on offense be separate from cap stops somehow, not sure)."

Tribes,2txcha,AFireInAsa,1 point,Wed Jan 28 08:07:18 2015 UTC,"For some reason people call the DS route between the BE spawn tower and turret a ""front"". So if you assume that, then the rest falls into place. I think people also called the BE route that bounces on the trapezoid rock a ""straight back"". These two don't conflict so I think that's where it comes from.  If you adopt the line between bases convention then you get weird shit with Bella and a few other maps."

Tribes,2tv9gw,ACDtubes,2,Wed Jan 28 04:22:01 2015 UTC,"bans require manual action from apc, and are extraordinarily easy to dodge, even if you're using known hacks, because it's not hard to circumvent the game's detection either."
Tribes,2tv9gw,ACDtubes,1 point,Thu Jan 29 19:21:11 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is APC no longer responds to hackers. Perhaps his job title or duties have changed. But the fact that these 2 accounts are still active says it all :/  Three actually. Footage was submitted of a third hacker quite some time ago. No response or action taken on that one either.   It makes sense I suppose. If they're looking to dwindle the playerbase even more, an effective tactic would be to let the hackers run free."
Tribes,2tv9gw,Pottytrainedtoilet,1 point,Thu Jan 29 20:12:25 2015 UTC,"APC is no longer employed to work on tribes. Nobody is. Any time he bans someone, it's because he likes the game and is willing to take time to do it. He's given no incentives to do so. If you really want something done, then send an email to him directly, because nothing else is going to be checked. This is compounded by the fact that T:A is a coding disaster with awful security, and making a new account takes less than 30 seconds. I know a guy personally who got tired of making new accounts every time he got banned, so he made a script and registered 250k accounts in one night. There's zero method of keeping people from dodging the bans, so for most of the known people all APC can do is log into T:A and punch in some IPs, which according to him are the same half dozen or so that he's memorized at this point.  HiRez isn't letting hackers run free because of some kind of malicious plan, they're doing it because they're incompetent and don't care."
Tribes,2tv9gw,FM4k,1 point,Thu Jan 29 21:28:45 2015 UTC,"These emails have all been sent directly to APC. I think all of the hackers posted on that YouTube channel have been banned solely because of the emails sent directly to APC.  However, several months ago APC indicated in one of his responses that he no longer has the ability to ban players' Tribes accounts. He began to forward these emails to ""someone else"". Didn't matter much because the bans still happened. Although it would take a day or two longer than it had before.  Currently though there are no further responses from APC and no bans being given out.   You're right about the bans being super easy to bypass anyhow though. I suppose it's all moot. Just as the game itself is now."

Tribes,2todym,Achus619,1 point,Mon Jan 26 19:22:08 2015 UTC,"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxapIMMbN0  All the important shit here it seems.  I don't know much about capping as some other guys, but the game stays alive because of people willing to give it a shot.  Be mindful that there's a good amount of videos out there that will teach you all kinds of things. Some things may be out of date, as of April 2013 (the last patch) and may not work. Also rock bouncing is a real thing and is a great tool in a cappers box.  The only other thing you really need to learn as a capper is how to fight, and you're good to go."
Tribes,2todym,DortmunderJungs,1 point,Mon Jan 26 21:19:55 2015 UTC,"I made a thread and some videos about playing pathfinder defense and chasing, although it is aimed at the competitive ruleset.

Tribes,2todym,Lowerend,1 point,Mon Jan 26 04:44:33 2015 UTC,"For routes, check Kigabit's capping compendium on the sidebar.   For ld (light defense), you want to make full usage out of your concussion grenades and 'conc' cappers right after they grab. It's a bit more complicated than that if you're facing an organized team but for pubs you want to float around your stand eliminating threats the best you can and of course, being in position for the conc.   Loadouts are also pretty important. Say for example you're dead but you know there's a capper that's going to be coming in soon. You'd want to switch to a loadout with rage/lightweight so you can chase. Typically though, you'd run rage/quick draw."

Tribes,2tao6x,Zwitterions,4,Thu Jan 22 17:14:41 2015 UTC,I think this is the perfect length for a capping montage.  Great speed and control!
Tribes,2tao6x,Schreq,3,Thu Jan 22 17:33:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Was pretty good and not too long. 60fps on youtube is somewhat both, a blessing and a curse, though. Awesome smoothness but it also means you can't do slomos with your 60fps shadowplay footage."
Tribes,2tao6x,Zwitterions,1 point,Thu Jan 22 18:03:58 2015 UTC,does 60 fps hurt slow-mo? I would have assumed it would help.
Tribes,2tao6x,J4ckTh3Bl4ck,1 point,Thu Jan 22 18:08:22 2015 UTC,"it hurts because it's only 60 and you have no excuse to make a 30 fps montage if you have 60 fps clips, I think that's what he's saying"
Tribes,2tao6x,Schreq,3,Thu Jan 22 18:11:46 2015 UTC,"Yeh. If your source and the final thing is 60 fps and you make a part playback at 50% speed, that part will essentially look like 30 fps (duplicated frames). Depends on how picky you are, but those slomos are a lot choppier and I instantly noticed it in this montage. Anyway, I'd still take choppy slomos and 60 fps over an all 30 fps ;)"
Tribes,2tao6x,sheepieee,1 point,Thu Jan 22 18:19:32 2015 UTC,it is choppy at 30fps on youtube though
Tribes,2tao6x,Schreq,1 point,Thu Jan 22 20:49:25 2015 UTC,Then it might be even less than half speed. 50% was just an example anyway. Or it's caused by youtubes conversion to 30 fps.

Tribes,2tao6x,Lowerend,5,Mon Jan 26 00:07:20 2015 UTC,nice editing(as always) and very nice clips but imo the intro was a bit too long for a montage thats only ~3 minutes long. still pretty cool :D

Tribes,2tao6x,MKRWSeek,3,Fri Jan 23 12:27:01 2015 UTC,"NIce, it was interesting to me to slow these down in youtube to see exactly how you cowboyed the HOF.  I used to HOF so I always wondered how a capper got out on me sometimes.  It seemed that when the HoFs did the little hop right before you grab you were able to impulse them out of the way or grab around them, or go right underneath them.  I guess the hop technique might not be the best but how can you stop toegrabs.  Anyway good montage."
Tribes,2tao6x,AvianIsTheTerm,6,Thu Jan 22 16:58:11 2015 UTC,best way to stop tricky cappers like this is to be completely unaware of them and just hop/ski around on the stand until they crash into you by pure accident 100% skill on your part. Trust me I'm an expert in this department.
Tribes,2tao6x,pard0n99,1 point,Thu Jan 22 17:43:27 2015 UTC,thats actually right :D you cant judge a random running HoF as capper :D

Tribes,2tao6x,J4ckTh3Bl4ck,1 point,Thu Jan 22 19:35:44 2015 UTC,xDDD
Tribes,2tao6x,Lowerend,4,Thu Jan 22 20:53:10 2015 UTC,"To my mind those situations are an argument against relying so heavily on Super Heavy for stops.    Back when Australian comp was a thing almost none of the higher tier HoFs used super heavy.    Even since then, AU pugs have usually had a pretty high standard of capping (i.e. bloody and snowy), and still, at least speaking for myself and the one or two other people who have HoFed long enough to play when comp was alive, we don't often use Super Heavy.    I usually run JUG with Safety Third / QD or BRT with Rage / QD. Generally I'll only use Super Heavy on DX.    Playing without Super Heavy frees you up a lot to deal with O (e.g. playing 'Roaming JUG' and only jumping on the stand at key times), but it means you can't rely on a bodyblock to stop a capper.    Instead you have to rely on a combination of chain as they come in + groundpound or MA + bodyblock as a final backup. It makes it easier to screw up and let a capper out at full health, but it also gives you more versatility to deal with cappers who toegrab or who thrust-dodge as they hit the flag."
Tribes,2tao6x,J4ckTh3Bl4ck,2,Thu Jan 22 22:29:21 2015 UTC,"Yah, kout hof, sekae, used to use brute without superheavy.  In the early days of comp tribes, Hofs like Titan, promoted using quickdraw instead of superheavy.  I used to hof w/o it as well but we also had mines so a lot of times you could get a mine hit and ground pound. The meta has changed so much, I think if you are spot on with the nova colt you wouldn't need to get a body block.  You can gp the capper fairly easy and nova colt him in the back on his exit and your snipe could cover you for the colt shots you miss.  But, this tactic means cappers are going to get the flag off the stand and it can be dangerous on maps like Arx when the flag gets midfield."
Tribes,2tao6x,wordthompsonian,1 point,Fri Jan 23 18:11:32 2015 UTC,"Going QD isn't without its drawbacks, for sure.    And you also do make a good point w.r.t. mines - certainly when I was learning to HoF we had mines to make the stops for us (I can still remember the glitch mine placements, at least on Arx/Kata).    If you're facing a PTH capper then your stopping power isn't too diminished by going QD - a groundpound will take most of their health, and a few colt shots / X1 shots on the way in or out should get them.    Against a SLD capper you really have to rely on knocking them off-course more. In that situation Superheavy is probably more useful a lot of the time."
Tribes,2tao6x,Achus619,2,Fri Jan 23 21:25:32 2015 UTC,"I'm a very very bad hof, tho what I usually do in those situation is try to be between the capper and the flag and go for MA/bodyblock. it's very risky because if the capper has a decent amount of energy he's gonna thrust around you and you are gonna cri liek lil bby. but it's still your best shot in my opinion"

Not to mention they are building the game with the help of the community.   There was a playable build of UT4 (they officially just call it Unreal Tournament) within a month or two of development for anyone in the community to play. You just have to make an account on their forums and download the UE4 launcher and you can play right now.

That way it minimizes the button presses so you don't necessarily need a drop-pack, drop-gun etc. key but you can use them for more fine grained control, or as a simple pick everything up by just walking over stuff, after you threw equipment away, instead of having to mash use-button on 4 different items. Best of both worlds and I don't see how else it could be improved without using some weird inventory menu type thing.  About ammo I don't know. Was ammo for every weapon a seperate drop or was it just the weapon which basically gave you that type of ammo? I guess nades are seperate drops?!"
Tribes,2t6miq,yeum,3,Wed Jan 21 17:51:59 2015 UTC,"I would say this, + the holo projection suggestion showing contents of the dead body if the backthought still is that the entire dead player loadout must be accessible as a pick-up.  That being said, while I agree having so many ""throw/drop X"" keys is definitively excessive and confusing, I kind of also have a beef with the ""press <generic ""use"">key to switch weapon/pack"" -option.   Thing is, it basically forces you to stop completely and aim precisely at that little thing on the ground/targeting a hovering list of stuff. Flicking CTRL-whateverthrowkey and just straight ejecting the unwanted equipment in the air and then walking/skiing over what you want makes you much less of a target and gets you on with the game much faster once you're accustomed to it.   To avoid unwanted weapon pickups, you could simply have auto-weapon pickup prioritize picking weapons in your currently selected loadout, in accord to the order they're listed in it (ex. slot 1:spinfusor: slot 2:chaingun: slot 3:mortar: slot 4:GL: slot5:plasma:), before moving on to pick up anything not in your currently selected loadout.  Which is to say, ideally I'd prefer to have it possible to have both the speed of the old-style individual drop binds, as well as the more general simple/user-friendly option of ""loot pack contents with use key"". Is there any reason to not have both? You could just leave the individual throw-keys unbound in the default config setup to not confuse new players.   Was ammo for every weapon a seperate drop or was it just the weapon which basically gave you that type of ammo?   Ammo stays on the dead body/dropped weapon, unless the player specifically threw it away via the drop ammo key. In that case it'd spawn its own ammo entity.   IIRC you also only picked up as much ammo as the dead player hadn't used up already, so at times you got nothing of what you wanted even if the enemy carried that weapon, because the enemy player had used up all of his.  Lack of a ""universal ammo nugget"" also prevented base-camping heavies from picking up mortar/GL ammo from naked spawn lights, which would obviously be pretty nasty from a base defense PoV if possible."

Flicking CTRL-whateverthrowkey and just straight ejecting the unwanted equipment in the air and then walking/skiing over what you want makes you much less of a target and gets you on with the game much faster once you're accustomed to it.    You could give the player some leeway in terms of pickup radius to resolve that issue. As in, you ski over/near an item, a notification persists ""press <x> to swap weapon/item/pack <y> with weapon/item/pack <z>"" for a certain distance and then goes away. This way you don't have to stop what you're doing and you don't have to preemptively clear a filled slot.  Edit: To simplify weapons/packs/etc you could bundle each player's loot on death into a special object. When a player passes over the bundle they are given a mini swap menu with each element of the bundle keyed separately. For ex player 1 passes over/near player 2's death bundle you could just have a popup say something like:  Key <X> Spinfusor --> Bolt-Launcher  Key <Y> Energy Pack --> Shield-Pack  Whatever player 1 takes is removed from the bundle, and whatever they swapped it for is added to the bundle."
Tribes,2t6miq,Schreq,3,Wed Jan 21 23:59:04 2015 UTC,"Increasing the pickup radius doesn't work that well when there are 2 or more items laying pretty close to each other unless you want to display 2 of those messages with 2 different pick-up keys.  Best is to keep it simple like I suggested, imo. You can further improve the grabbing with the use-key by having small 2D icons like quakes ""cg_SimpleItems 1"" (see mizzus post). If you can see those items from further away, you can decide what to grab beforehand. Then when skiing by, it becomes a matter of timing your use-key and quickly aiming at the right things :) Pickups don't have to be simplified to the point where you would never have to stop."
Tribes,2t6miq,Schreq,1 point,Thu Jan 22 09:53:43 2015 UTC,"Loot pack content is a nice idea in combination with individual items/weapons on the ground and could be done as follows: Pressing use-button on the dead body will fill all your empty slots and loot all ammo you and the dead guy share. Holding the use-button will replace everything. Of course if you do that, the individual items will also disappear from the ground. Such system still wouldn't know which weapon to prioritize but I'm not sure how important that really is. If you want all the ammo somebody had, and only one specific weapon, it would be 2 key strokes."
Tribes,2t6miq,wordthompsonian,3,Thu Jan 22 15:07:32 2015 UTC,"Are we being realistic or are we playing video gaems? Let's assume the latter. I would suggest each weapon pick-up be bound to a key. You can tell which weapon it is by an IFF that grows as you get closer (so you see there is dropped stuff, as you get closer there is a holo-projection of sorts detailing the weapons) and as you go over it, if it's in your pack, say flare grenades, you auto-update ammo. If you have flares and want concussion grenades from the body, press a keybind to eject current nades and pick up floor-nades. Have a different keybind for each, so you can eject your primary or second ondary or tertiary weapon, and pick up the floor weapon.       Does that make sense?"

Tribes,2t6miq,Grimbl0r,3,Wed Jan 21 17:32:00 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest that you auto pickup weapons in your selected loadout, dropping the weapon in that slot or shifting it to an empty slot if you have one.  So say in your first slot you have a blaster, and in the loadout it's a gren launcher, and you run over a gren launcher, you'd drop or move the blaster to an empty slot and put the gren launcher in the first slot. If you run over a weapon thats not in your loadout, it goes into an empty slot.  You could also have preference ranking of weapons on top of that if you want, so if you run over 2 weapons at once and have a single slot, it'd pick them up in a known order.  Maybe even drop non-loadout weapons if you run over a higher preference weapon."

Allow the item/corpse pickup mechanic to work like INV'ing:   Imagine being LO (Spin/GL/CG) and you kill a LD (Spin/Laser/CG). You want his Laser Rifle. Before skiing over his body you would press your LD loadout-shortcut, which would filter the weapons you want.  Added to this could be a new feature on the inventory screen, at weapon selection screen you could add an ""replaced by XXX upon pickup"" option. To make it even more advanced you could add priorities in there. Like 1. Laser 2. GL 3. Plasma or whatever.  This would be reasonably intuitive, would not add keybinds, still allow mid-game weapon customisation and it's rather quick."

Tribes,2t6miq,Shaeress,3,Thu Jan 22 01:10:09 2015 UTC,"Well, that would need to be a broader issue to design around. If you want weapons to be completely swappable that needs to start with weapon and class design. If there are any weapon restrictions between light, medium and heavy classes there'll be a lot of weapons that lights can't pick up. If there are full class restrictions were every weapon can pretty much only be used by one class the system becomes too convoluted to even try to have swappable weapons and a battlefield approach might be better (where people do drop their equipment, but as their complete set of equipment). In general weapon variety and complexity will need to be compromised for weapons to be conveniently swappable. With the vast amount of guns available in T;A there are some combinations that wouldn't really favour the game if it was allowed. A good example of this is the raider in T;A, that can become what the comp community has rather unanimously deemed OP, if it gets to have it's auto, plasma gun and shields. Not because any of those weapons are actually OP in the context of T;A (plasma is on brute and not considered OP and both shields and NJ5b are still allowed), but the combination is. I'm sure there are other combinations of pack/primary/secondary/class that would become extremely powerful if all weapons could be put on any class or even if we just reduced it to light/medium/heavy restrictions. I guess it's not inherently so, but if you've got two weapon slots, five guns and two grenades that's 50 combination you need to balance. If you've got 6 weapons and 3 grenades that becomes 108. It grows rather quickly and with a large and open set of equipment you get a huge number of combination and the balancing is bound to either take forever (a la Blizzard), that will be poorly done or that relies on a lot of restrictions (a la T;A).  T2 has less weapon variety than T;A because of this. T;A pretty much has all of the guns from T2, with a lot of variants, and more still. T;A instead suffers from problems with balance (which I can't really comment on for T2) and restrictions. Can you imagine if T;A had weapon specific ammo drops? You could kill someone playing the same class as you and still not get any ammo... and trying to group things together into a few distinct categories still make for a lot of exceptions or very small categories (like inf laser knives and arx buster).  Another important factor is, like you mentioned, the idea that an enemy O can overrun and then hold your base. We also get some factors on this from T;A. One is map design and spawn locations. Since T;A has random spawns it becomes rather easy to see how much of a difference something like that can radically change how easy or difficult it is to retake a base. How spawn locations work, how near they are to inventory stations, whether inventory stations are destructible, gener powered and how easily, quickly and cheaply they can be called in also plays in significantly and on some maps, with some spawns the enemy O can get to your base almost as quickly as you can. T;A also has health regen, which means that the D can't wear the enemy O out very easily, since any lull in the retaking of the base means that the enemy can get full health. Having shield packs and the survivalist perk means that even without health regen some enemies in your base could become very resilient.  If any of these things work in certain ways it means that equipment swapping and looting might not only be superfluous and convoluted, but also a poor and balance breaking mechanic. If all of those things do enable, more or less, naked spawns and more open loadouts then I think I'd try to do it like this:  When someone dies they don't drop all of their equipment. They only drop the currently equipped weapon, their grenades, their pack and potentially a small, generic ammo nugget. This both reduces clutter (if people can have three weapons, a grenade and a pack that's five items just like that. Three of which uses the same slots). Then I'd do it rather simply by letting people drop their various equipment with different keybinds. This makes for more controls, but the option is to have a swap key, like suggested by others, so that you just aim at something you want, grab it and it swaps with whatever you've got in your hands or with the appropriate grenade/pack. I'm not a fan of this, especially if people drop all of their equipment, because it causes a lot of clutter and it also means that you can't do swaps while moving. If an enemy drops their gun and you want to pick it up you have to approach the body, aim at it and click. If you can drop one of your weapons and they only drop one, then you can just ski over it and pick it up. This won't really work if people drop all of their weapons (how would the game know which of the three guns you skied over you wanted?). I'd rather have the complexity and the inconvenience be in the controls than inherent to the gameplay mechanics, especially since swapping equipment doesn't even need to be a necessary thing to do for most players in most circumstances (and you could still have the use key swap for any equipment you're aiming at, for people that have the time and don't want to bother with the controls). The generic ammo nugget would just be there to fill in any need to swap weapons just for ammo or to try and scavenge for your gun. Especially if people just drop the gun they're using, since then you could kill someone that used a mortar just to get the mortar ammo, only to have them duel you with a chain gun and only get the wrong ammo.  I think that if you want to have the complexity, the looting and the swapping then you're either going to have concede certain things (like swapping packs, grenades or having generic ammo drops) or you'll have to deal with either cluttering or complex controls... and honestly, I don't think conceding some things would necessarily be bad. Having intricate and varied gameplay doesn't need to come from such complexities. Personally, I find the scavenging or completely naked spawns to not be a necessary part of Tribes. The game has enough complexity and intricacies from its core mechanics. But I also see how it certainly can be a nice mechanic to have and the best way to counter complexity is to have good UI. If the game is constantly telling you how things work, then things can work out even if it's complex. T;A lacks a lot of complexity because they obviously didn't want a lot of in-game UI, so there's no base turret customisation or anything like that."
Tribes,2t6miq,THEM0RNlNGW00D,2,Wed Jan 21 20:10:38 2015 UTC,"I feel the modern one button weapon swap approach to be much more convenient. Switch to undesired weapon, point reticule to desired, press G. Fast, simple, no fuss. If the player wants to make it LSHIFT+F5+NUMPAD7 let them do so on their own time. Skiing over the body could allow any currently usable ammo to be collected, doesn't need an explanation since its just looting. Alternatively a generic ammo pack can fall along side with some extra information inside, if the player had a ring and grenade launcher but no mortar or mines then the ammo pack doesn't replenish either."
Tribes,2t6miq,CheezeCaek2,2,Wed Jan 21 17:14:40 2015 UTC,"Why not a preference system you can include with your current loadout/armor?  So your 'chaser' skin would pick up the grnade launcher before it picks up the plasma gun, etc. All these settings can be adjusted in your loadout screens."
Tribes,2t6miq,dold_,1 point,Wed Jan 21 19:56:36 2015 UTC,"I had a lot more written, but people smarter than me are also writing long comments. So in the interest of not contributing to the essay collection, I'm just going to add one (very) minor idea, concerning weapon drops, assuming we are only dropping one weapon.  What if, instead of dropping the currently equipped weapon on death, the player drops a random weapon in their loadout?   1) It eliminates the tactic of ""I'm about to die, I'm going to switch to my worst weapon"". The tactic may not be a problem to gameplay, but it is another thing for players to learn, and doesn't add to the fun (in my opinion). There is already enough to learn in these types of games.  2) It may actually increase variety in what is littering the ground, since players will probably have their weapon with the most ""utility"" out more often. For example, if it turns out that the Disc Launcher is useful in most situations, players will have it equipped and ready to fire more often than a more situational weapon, say, a Mortar. Nonrandom drops would have a lot of Discs, and very few mortars, while random drop would have comparatively less Discs and more Mortars. This is only theory, of course.  Obviously, this is a super small detail, but I like thinking about small details."

Tribes,2t6miq,PubFiction,1 point,Fri Jan 23 00:27:44 2015 UTC,"I only have one suggestion which would probably be shot down due to the untraditional nature and the seemingly unrelenting tribe’s nostalgia that causes people to constantly try to force the game to be like it was in the past.   Basically copy the half-life 2 death match gravity gun.  You point it at the weapon you want and pull it to you if you are in a decent range. If you can take that weapon it will replace the weapon in the slot. This would be intuitive, IE noobs would understand it without having to think much about random keys you have to press. Second if you grab a gun you cannot take, you could hold on to it and throw it to a team mate or just throw it away. This would add another element of team play that is intuitive. And it would make the game a little less ridiculous having to go walk over each item. No funny keys to press that are unintuitive or anything like that. And it opens up the game play for more depth.  Another note, why does tribes need to be only 1 weapon falling. You all realize that was probably originally coded into the game to reduce system load and resources right? Why do people think the greatest thing in tribes is switching to a bad weapon and letting someone kill you? It’s not and no one outside of tribe’s players cares about it. Letting that tactic go will not matter at all to the game. Now days everything is just so different. Tribes is played with far less players, computers are far more powerful. We could easily make it so all your items drop not just 1 and a pack. And basic physics interactions could cause them to spread out enough for you to grab the one you want in most cases."
Tribes,2t6miq,jojotmagnifficent,1 point,Sat Jan 24 05:00:52 2015 UTC,"I like the system ""futurist"" styled games seem to have adopted where salvageable items get a high contrast outline/silhouette to make them obvious (fits with having a HUD capable visor) and then as you get closer they can display text/info when you look right at them. In some games I'm strongly against manual item pickups (i.e. the looting in the new wolfensein game), but it a game like Trobes I think it's fine. Having to manually look at what you want and press the swap out key is simple and reliable and doesn't take too long to do. Having to manually look at it prevents accidental pickups and using the highlighting idea makes it obvious to users what they are getting, and can even be more useful by not highlighting stuff they can't pickup (i.e. fusion mortars on a light).   For tossing/Pickup I also like the idea of simply using ctrl/alt + the key for that particular item i.e. alt+1 tosses or swaps out weapon 1 in your inv, alt+ g tosses/swaps out your nades etc. modifier keys are simple and easy to make intuitive. You also need to pay a little attention to how items are dumped on death, if you can put in some spread then it stops fighting to highlight the correct one. Maybe avoid clutter by only dropping the equipped weapon (add some strategy by swapping to a weak weapon before you die to deny an enemy at the cost of not doing that last bit of damage).  For ammo, I think a segmented style of universal ammo works best in terms of gameplay vs realism. Having all chain variants use a single ammo type, all nades share fuse modules, all explosives share explosive cores or what have you. An alternative for this can be to have weapons run on energy and make that somewhat universal (but that can have it's own drawbacks too). Maybe have some weapons energy fed (like a blaster, laser chain and sniper) while others require a secondary ammo source (i.e explosive core for rocketlaunchers/grenade launchers) and some have unique ammo like the fusion mortar. Tieing everything to a single source tends to go bad, especially when you have a high drain weapon (oops fire my mortard twice, now no chain ammo left...), but having everything require dedicated pickup types can make running out in the field to common and costly (have to stop whatever you are doing, go to inv, fucks over attackers on sustained assaults).  I think looting is a good mechanic though, the game would likely be much better off for it than not having it."
Tribes,2t6miq,Pumpelchce,1 point,Thu Jan 22 04:50:08 2015 UTC,"I would not go with a solution that allows pre-settings like: I prefere Plasma the most, so with prio 1, pick up plasma, if there is no prio-list, pick plasma or nothing. I believe this might scare away ppl who take a sneak peak.  It's very tempting to have a system that does not create popups to pick the desired item from, but this might leave new players struggling with what did they now actually pick, no! I have to drop it know, and walk away and over it again, rince and repeat. If one has the keyboard skills and exp/overview, it's the smoothest one.  I think, mainly also to feed the bigger mass of lazy/comfy players, best solution is actually something like evanvolm has presented: popup that allows to pick, but maybe that popup should also show all items that are hold right now and in case there is no space you can drop one of your items just to doubleclick pick an item that is on a dead body."

Tribes,2t6miq,mizzu704,0,Wed Jan 21 17:05:05 2015 UTC,"Being a quaker, I would obvously prefer to be able to hold as many weapons as there are in the game, so I would only drop a weapon if I wanted to give it to a teammate. But that obviously wouldn't work in a tribes-like with inv stations where there are also subtypes of holdables like Grenades, Mines etc..  Regarding pickups after dying, I know of three systems, which all come from quake and probably wouldn't work at all, but I'm gonna write them down anyway: One is the backpacket system from QW. It works like this: If you frag an enemy, he drops a backpacket. Contained in that is the last weapon your enemy held when he died and all the ammo he had for other weapons. If you grab it, it just gives you all that, including the ammo for weapons you do not currently posses (only ammo tho). If the enemy had no ammo left, you're obviously not gonna get any.  The other system is from QL and it just gives you the last weapon the enemy had and some ammo for it, where it doesn't matter how much ammo he had left. E.g. a rocket launcher pickup would always give you 10 rockets, even if he didn't have any left. So you only get ammo for one weapon, but you can be sure to get a decent amount.   I'm not sure if I remember the third system correctly, but this is from Q3 CPMA: If your enemy dies, he just drops everything he had. Meaning that if he had weapons that you do not currently have, you get them even if he didn't die holding it. If he had all weapons, you suddenly have all the weapons.   In addition, if you run over enemy bodies, sometimes you pick up the wrong weapons (why did it give me this heavy's plasma gun instead of a grenade launcher?).   A way to solve this would be to make the body disappear immediately after he died and drop every weapon he had seperately (or only the one he was holding). Also, regarding weapon pickups (or any pickups really), don't make the models just lay on the floor where you can hardly see them, let them levitate a bit above ground (on waist-height or so) or use simpleitems   If you had flare grenades and ran over a body with concussion grenades, you wouldn't get any more flare grenades.    Regarding this, I think it depends on how many types of grenades/weapons you have. If there are 5 types of grenades, it would maybe make sense to make grenade-ammo unified (or differentiate between ""combat-grenades"" (anything that does damage) or ""tactical-grenades"", (e.g. flashes/flares)). If there's only two (e.g. frag nades and flares), make them incompatible."
Tribes,2t6miq,evanvolm,-1,Wed Jan 21 18:33:08 2015 UTC,"Hm.  If it really needed to be addressed, I guess something similar to the Arma inventory screen could work, though I'd like to see things sped up as much as possible.  I've watched a lot of Arma 2 and 3 videos, and the whole system of checking someones bag, giving them ammo, taking ammo/items, is so god damn tedious and unnecessarily long.  But it does cover the issue of accidentally picking up a blaster rather than laser rifle.    I mean, in T1 and I assume T2 it sort of does a decent job at making sure you can only pick up things your armor can hold, so lights can't pick up Mortars and heavies can't pick up laser rifles.  Another issue would have to be addressed though.  Weapons and packs don't always end up right on top of a dead body.  If someone gets a disc shot up their ass or a mortar lands in their lap, both the body and its weapons will be spread out quite a bit.  For this 'fix' to work, you would need to make sure everything stays in tact or at least nearby the corpse somehow.  Picking up an accidental blaster is annoying, yeah.  But looking around for an epack or LR when you KNOW that body had one, is even more annoying.  It just wastes time.   I suppose you could just ignore that whole 'looking for x weapon' part and have it magically be available when looking at their corpse, popping open the inventory screen, and pick what weapons they had in their loadout.  This would be one of the better solutions, imo.  Just double click the icon, and it's added to your invo.  http://i.imgur.com/bLUTj8N.png"
Tribes,2t6miq,KindaGamey,-4,Wed Jan 21 21:39:01 2015 UTC,"I discussed something just like this in the ""Tribes Wishlist"" thread and, surprise, it got ridiculed and downvoted.  Basically, Tribes repair guns use nanobots to repair. I suggest that nano-material could be the essence of everything constructed in the Tribes Universe -- you need the base 3D printer/assembler to be enabled/have power, and you need to have enough nano-material (and the appropriate blueprint) in order to complete the job. You can 3D print: new respawns, sensors, inv stations, turrets, whatever.   A portable assembler might have a limited capacity in the field, like deployable inv.   A suit may even have a very small assembler that could create grenades, etc. You could swap weapons you find, or disassemble them into material. Spare nano-material you can return to your base stores or use for yourself to construct something.  Nano-material left outside too long decomposes and returns to the sky where it can be collected with collectors that do so at a certain constant rate (like solar panels.) That way you can guarantee you only have so many objects at one time on any map. Also, there is a penalty cost for creating too many fatties or people wasting too much ammo. YES, it actually makes SENSE why you'd have disc launchers instead of spraying and praying with bullets.    http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/2l5jlb/wishlist_for_next_tribes_game/clruzly"

If the game revolves around conserving nano material then nothing will get done. People already d stack with turrets because it's safe and easy, but now you want to provide them a real reason for doing so.  The part about using nano material for invos, vehicles, deployables is fine. It would be similar to T:A except it wouldn't be points.   Needing nano material for ammo however, is so not cool. Look at how bad people are already, then imagine what's going to happen when you punish newbloods for missing too much. Players will get frustrated and stop playing.   I'm going to assume, that if you collect a good amount of nano material then die, you lose it. That too, would be awful. If you deposit it at the base, someone else will likely use it then you'll get pissed off you can't afford anything. If you keep it, you'll probably die at some point then you have nothing. Such a mechanic, if it existed, again creates an environment where it's increasingly hard to upgrade.   Your ideas make sense, but I have a VERY hard time believing that it would be fun. Fun is first, not ideas that make sense."
Tribes,2t6miq,KindaGamey,1 point,Wed Jan 21 22:29:13 2015 UTC,"Of course you would manipulate the amount of ""scarcity"" to reach a point where it was fun and loose enough that players felt free to do what they wanted, but you retained some manipulation of player behavior towards conservation and coordination. Linear single player FPS's do it all the time with limiting the amount of ammo finds, but letting you go on rampages without punishing you too much -- you gotta find that nice balance point. If people are creating turrets and people then a few bullets are a relative drop in the bucket. Someone dying too much, though, would be devastating to the team -- same as it is in arena or deathmatch. A loss of a vehicle would be felt far more than a point loss. Coordinated attacks would be less wasteful and more ensured to be victorious.  It isn't intended to be something you micromanage. It is a subtle pressure, the same way that capitalism operates on us. It hangs in the background and changes people's behavior, rewarding cooperating and teamwork. The command console would have to come back - positions of leadership would be handy.  I'd even capitalize on the name ""Tribes"" - have teams be able to cast out players from their tribe which can then be snapped up by the other team or they are just wildlings... fighting to break down either Tribe from succeeding.  Why not take team stacking and make it a metric rather than something that needs to be legislated?  I'm sorry you can't see this the way I can in my head. My favorite Tribes memory is actually reading the T2 manual on the way back from Toys R' Us and thinking, ""this is incredible! this makes total sense!"" (gens powering station devices, etc.) I'd never seen anything like that in a first person shooter before.   I'm sure there were people shooting down the ""complexity"" of that too - ""it'll never work in a first person shooter... flags, gens, shields, sensors... it's too much.""  I think games are amazing when they make gameworld 'sense' and there are little strings everywhere connecting everything - like when game economies are legitimate and not set by the program. This stuff matters and has real (game) world consequences in player behavior whether you realize it (as a gamer) or not.  I'm making a board game out of this whole concept so I rescind my idea anyway. It will be fun."
Tribes,2t6miq,KindaGamey,1 point,Thu Jan 22 15:49:23 2015 UTC,"""Money"" is basically a nano-material that makes anything in video games. I could have said that and there'd be no complaints. I just like games where everything is a mechanic and has in-game consequences.  Hi-Rez's approach is to divorce in-game ""reality"" and just say screw it. You aren't created in base, you spawn on a hill. Do gens affect deployables? Ummm, yes? no? We can't decide so you figure it out. The HUD sensor arrow appears above an enemy head no matter what, but not behind another object IF the sensors are down. What??  They just don't care about plausibility and the game suffers for it."
Tribes,2t6miq,persuasionlaser,1 point,Thu Jan 22 17:52:31 2015 UTC,"one dying too much, though, would be devastating to the team -- same as it is in arena or deathmatch   That just seems too sketchy to me. A single player could easily destroy the entire enemy team if they got fed by even only a couple of players.    I'd even capitalize on the name ""Tribes"" - have teams be able to cast out players from their tribe which can then be snapped up by the other team or they are just wildlings... fighting to break down either Tribe from succeeding.   Wouldn't this require all the players from a certain tribe being online and playing with each other? Like competitive play? Seems much simpler to have skill based matchmaking. Player profiles would have a tab that shows their score and a breakdown of why their score is what it is. You could have graphs and shit using past matches to see how you've improved and what your average ""score"" is when playing differently.   Wish I could see it better from your point of view, but good luck with your game."

That a lot of the plays themselves are painfully mediocre (and rather pathetic if those are the best plays they could pull within HiRez) isn't something someone new will really realise.  Apart from that I mostly tend to show I Am King and Knutsson's ESL highlights, for a bit of variety that still offers both impressive and easily appreciated play.  Mostly I tend to start with the explanation: So, you know of Quake or UT, right? Cool, so imagine that, but with huge outdoors maps with steep hills and you play CTF. Now imagine everyone's got jetpacks to climb those hills and when you press space you turn friction off. So, you fly up a giant hill, hold space and slide down it building more and more speed, and it was CTF, so you can go super fast and snitch the enemy flag up quickly enough to outrun their bullets. That's usually all it takes. If it's still just ""halo with jetpacks"" your friend seems to struggle with even the concepts that a shooter can be something in an almost completely different genre than CS, CoD, BF and Halo and primarily be about something other than shooting dudes in the face. If that's the case you should just sit him down and play... TA or some arena/twitch shooter. Just broadening horizons."

Tribes,2t01uk,DarcseeD,4,Tue Jan 20 22:06:02 2015 UTC,"First of all, if your friend doesn't want to play you won't convince them with a montage. To be able to fully appreciate the truly good montages one requires an understanding of the game that someone who hasn't played it just won't have. I'm not talking about montages with fancy editing and effects, but those that actually show good plays from comp/pug games.  The only way for someone new to the game to really understand what's going on is if you go through the montages with them and explain the more complex clips. Because how would your friend be able to appreciate the ""skill shots and clutch"" if he doesn't even understand the game?  The problem is, that much like with jokes, if you have to explain them, they lose a lot of their value.  But if your friend truly wants to put in the effort, you should sit him down and go through these montages while pausing, replaying and explaining the more complex plays:   jpWAI - Outrun Shad - Think"

Tribes,2t01uk,DarcseeD,-2,Tue Jan 20 12:37:17 2015 UTC,"If someone cannot appreciate a montage without out an previous understanding of the game then its a shit montage. Of which most of them actually are because they are not made to show off the game to a wide audience, the vast majority are just made to show off someone's cocky self to people who don't really care. But if you find a good one even a novice can certainly see how cool a game is.   A good montage should have a wide use of many weapons, include the points of the game IE flag caps, returns etc... And of course not be the bias view of someone of what they think is the ""best"" way to play. Many montages do nothing but try to pump up the spinfusor, but tribes players often forget the spinfusor is not even a unique weapon its no different than a rocket launcher in 15 other games."
Tribes,2t01uk,PubFiction,5,Tue Jan 20 05:16:30 2015 UTC,"If someone cannot appreciate a montage without out an previous understanding of the game then its a shit montage.   That's such a ridiculous statement. If you don't know the rules of the game and haven't at least tried playing it yourself you won't be able to fully appreciate high level play.  If a person doesn't understand the rules of basketball, they might be able to appreciate an impressive slam dunk, but they won't be able to appreciate the tactics and plays that set that dunk up.   Of which most of them actually are because they are not made to show off the game to a wide audience   Since when has that been a requirement? Sure, you can make an overly edited flashy montage that's dumbed down so that even someone who has never played an FPS game can somewhat understand what's going on, but that doesn't mean it's a good montage and that it's a good representation of the game.  Those kinds of montages are little more than flashy trailers designed for the lowest common denominator audiences who are intrigued by flashy lights and bright colors, instead of the gameplay itself.   A good montage should have a wide use of many weapons, include the points of the game IE flag caps, returns etc.   That's my no means a requirement. Variety is good, but not a necessity. By your logic a sniper can't make a montage without forcing in clips of him playing other roles he's not very good at. Or a capper can't make a pure capping montage without adding clips of their sub bar chaining.   And of course not be the bias view of someone of what they think is the ""best"" way to play.   What does that even mean in the context of a montage?   Many montages do nothing but try to pump up the spinfusor, but tribes players often forget the spinfusor is not even a unique weapon its no different than a rocket launcher in 15 other games.   Again, what has that got to do with making a good montage? A bad montage that focuses on spinfusor shots will be bad and a good montage that focuses on spinfusor shots will be good, it has nothing to do with the weapon itself."

Using anecdotal evidence to back up your claims sure is nice, isn't it? Your arguments have no substance at all.  ""I can show tons of gamers a good video like [insert good Tribes montage] and they will appreciate the video and get excited about playing it.""  You see how empty such a statement is without actually backing it up with something?   It is not a requirement for you or some tribes player to screw around on youtube it is a requirement if you are asking for something like the OP.   And your proof is where? You're argument is that a more focused montage is worse than a more varied one, yet you offer no proof.  One could even argue the complete opposite. A Tribes montage that jumps from capping to sniping to O to D to chase to TDM to arena is harder to follow and understand for someone who hasn't played the game, than a montage that is more focused.   If just showing any decent tribes player stroking his own ego was good enough the OP wouldn't be here asking cause you can see 9999 of those on your tube any day.   I don't get what you're problem is. So any Tribes montage is a ""tribes player stroking his own ego""? Yet montages from other games, like the Q3 one you mentioned, are not?

Has nothing to do with q3 other than that was a good example of a good montage. I have such videos from multiple games. Unfortunately even though I enjoy tribes I have as of yet been unable to find such a good montage in all the videos tribes players have made. ( I admit to not seeing them all show me one if you think you know better )  Also you realize everything in life is an anecdote right? Hey if you know so well then post up a video and see if the OP comes back going OMG DarceeD that was IT. MY FRIEND TOTALLY CHANGED HIS MIND after seeing that one guy play the same class 99% of the match and shoot the same weapon the whole time. All judgement of art is an anecdotal opinion deal with it. I really don't care if you buy my argument I said it so people who actually want to give the guy something can think critically about what they are suggesting not so some guy who is clearly set in his ways could argue with me.   Simply use your brain for a second to look at the comments the OP is posting back and you can clearly see where things have failed and how the videos people present simply fall into the exact stereotypes I listed above.
Tribes,2t01uk,MKRWSeek,1 point,Sun Jan 25 19:52:25 2015 UTC,"Oh great we got us a lawyer here. You cant prove its wrong so im right HA!   No, what I'm saying is that you should offer some sort of evidence to back up your claims.   You don't get it because you cannot separate your personal bias from reality. I didn't say any tribes montage is a player stroking his own ego. I simply said show them one that is not that. Has nothing to do with q3 other than that was a good example of a good montage.   If anyone's suffering from heavy personal biases here, it's you. You didn't say that all tribes montages are by players stroking their own ego, yet you say you have yet to see one that is not. This implies that you do believe that a lot of them are just stroking their own ego.  My question to you, which you've yet to answer, was how is the Q3 montage you mentioned different? Just like good Tribes montages, or good montages from any game, it shows people playing the game at a high level. If that qualifies as stroking your own ego, then the aforementioned Q3 montage is guilty of the same.   Also you realize everything in life is an anecdote right?   Even if that were true, we're not talking about life as a whole, we're talking about a very specific thing.   You made a rather far reaching claim in order to disprove what I had said, yet you didn't back your claim up with a shred of evidence. Simply saying that you've showed a Q3 montage to ""tons of gamers"" and they all got ""exited about playing"" means absolutely nothing.   Hey if you know so well then post up a video and see if the OP comes back going OMG DarceeD that was IT. MY FRIEND TOTALLY CHANGED HIS MIND after seeing that one guy play the same class 99% of the match and shoot the same weapon the whole time.   Did you even read the original post I made here, or are you too occupied with trying to discredit all Tribes montages? I ask this because you can't make a single post without implying that Tribes montages are somehow of lesser value than montages from other games. Statements like Tribes montages are ""just made to show off someone's cocky self"" and ""tribes player stroking his own ego"" really do suggest that you just have some issues with people who are good at this game.  It might be a stretch, but the only reasonable conclusion I can come up with is that you're a decent FPS player in other games yet are relatively bad at Tribes, so now, in order to feel better about yourself, you shit on people who make montages, since you don't want to admit to yourself how much better some people are at the game than you.   I really don't care if you buy my argument I said it so people who actually want to give the guy something can think critically about what they are suggesting not so some guy who is clearly set in his ways could argue with me.   I disproved your argument, since I feel you're misleading people. I don't want to argue with you, I just don't want you spreading bad information.   Simply use your brain for a second to look at the comments the OP is posting back and you can clearly see where things have failed and how the videos people present simply fall into the exact stereotypes I listed above.   Where have things failed? People have linked some good montages and made other suggestions as well. What stereotypes? Oh, the one's you made up in your head? Yeah, I don't think anyone other than yourself is worried about those stereotypes."

Tribes,2t01uk,youtubefactsbot,3,Tue Jan 20 01:39:29 2015 UTC,"Of course long range MA's have a fair bit of luck associated with them. Considering how much air control players have anything other than close range MA's can always be seen as lucky shots.  Why are you even arguing about MA's with him, instead of explaining that skill in this game doesn't revolve around being able to hit long range MA's?"
Tribes,2t01uk,Radmite,1 point,Tue Jan 20 03:05:53 2015 UTC,"The way you show its not all luck is you find a good montage that shows a player pulling off sequences of these shots. IE killing 3 people in short succession with mid airs, or juggling a player with disks multiple times till they die. There is an element of luck in all shots in all games but when a player can hit 4 mid airs in a row, the luck argument starts running a little thin."

Tribes,2sy7pu,Shadowfax7337,1 point,Mon Jan 19 23:11:33 2015 UTC,Firstly I know nothing about Aeria and I'm not sure I understand but I believe if you signed in and played Tribes Ascend then you have an account (regardless of how you access it).   I don't believe it matters if you use the direct launcher or the steam launcher to access the account. You should be able to uninstall your old launcher and then install Tribes Ascend from steam then when you run the launcher in stream it will ask for your login and password and run your account.   IOW your account and progress is not client side.
Tribes,2sy7pu,socalpk,1 point,Mon Jan 19 23:47:31 2015 UTC,"You still had to sign up for a HiRez account. any idea what email you used? If so then use that to do a password reset and then log into the HiRez site to get the user name of the account (if it didn't tell you int he reset email). Then start the steam client and log in with those credentials.  And yea, Tribes support is kinda dead. Because it's an account thing though instead of being about the game specifically then you might get a response still."

Tribes,2svm5m,CasualBBT,2,Tue Jan 20 21:07:05 2015 UTC,"Use a mix of chain/hitscan and explosive weapons.   When chaining focus on your bullets not your reticule.  Try to chain when your opponent is airborne, use explosives when they land.  Lower the quality settings so you can maintain a steady FPS.  Lower your mouse sensitivity for betting chaining accuracy.  Practice skiing and jet pack control as the whole game is about movement."
Tribes,2svm5m,LancerKagato,1 point,Mon Jan 19 16:10:54 2015 UTC,dont use one type of weapon. Mix auto's and explosives or hitscan and explosives. dont use AR/Eagle pistol SLD or Spinfusor/thumper SLD

Tribes,2svm5m,prettzl,-9,Mon Jan 19 13:00:41 2015 UTC,Shoot the ground behind you with explosive weapons while going fast to go faster.  Tap jetpack repeatedly while going up to use energy more efficiently.  Quit the game before you get attached to it.

Tribes,2svm5m,prettzl,-6,Thu Jan 22 01:44:35 2015 UTC,Rather than holding it down- do you even play this game?

Tribes,2svm5m,prettzl,-7,Mon Jan 19 04:53:38 2015 UTC,ikr
Tribes,2svm5m,Rellics,2,Mon Jan 19 05:16:16 2015 UTC,"Tapping jetpack while you still have energy is not energy efficiency. It is more efficient to hold down jetpack during the ascending part of your trajectory arc and release jetpack during the descend, followed up by a perfect landing (not a single jetpack tap during descend) on whichever hill you're trying to land on.   Tapping jetpack while you still have energy does not gain you more altitude than holding it down. The only way to gain more altitude from the same amount of energy used is to rock back and forth."
Tribes,2svm5m,persuasionlaser,2,Mon Jan 19 13:10:23 2015 UTC,tapping jetpack makes you go farther not higher.
Tribes,2svm5m,qhp,5,Mon Jan 19 02:08:18 2015 UTC,"I trust your thought-process over ...his, and would like to attempt to clarify.  For a new player: do not worry about ""using energy more efficiently"" just yet, at least not at this level. If you want to cap, learn that you should only use your jetpack as you ascend, and not touch it as you descend.  If you tap your jetpack while you are empty on energy, it's like squeezing as much possible upward thrust out of it as you can (in these situations, you will usually go higher and also longer by nature of trajectories). If you tap your jetpack while ascending and still having sufficient energy,  you will not go as high as you would if you used your jet all at once. Your trajectory will be flatter, but this still has its uses.  Overall, to the new player, if you want to learn how to cap, focus on some simple routes for now (might I recommend Arx Novena?). You will quickly find yourself slower and less elegant than videos online, and at that point you should focus on only jetting while ascending, and doing your best to minimize using jets on the descent. By following that rule to the highest level, you will by nature end up doing the tapping patterns I describe above."
Tribes,2svm5m,persuasionlaser,3,Mon Jan 19 04:00:36 2015 UTC,"Ah, you're right of course. Glad you corrected that."

Tribes,2skhbb,Loxiasus,2,Fri Jan 16 06:24:01 2015 UTC,"Just a small, seemingly random influx. Maybe some youtube video somewhere got promoted, maybe T;A was on some top games list again, maybe someone, somewhere wrote an article touching upon it or whatever. Maybe people just wanted some cozy skiing for the winter. Regardless, it's nothing too significant, even if it's nice with some fresh meat. Poor bastards."
Tribes,2skhbb,beerrun1,1 point,Fri Jan 16 14:23:33 2015 UTC,"Influx may not be the right word. But the Novice servers are always full, which I imagine has to do with T:A being a free-to-play game found in Steam. I wanted to make this to keep those players playing."

Also if you have a suitable setup for high settings, you should probably turn off Light shafts in the ini.

Tribes,2shtz2,socalpk,1 point,Thu Jan 15 17:21:51 2015 UTC,I know better than to ask for things like this because I know they won't do them.  You have to ask for things within reason. What I asked for isn't too much and it's not too little that it won't make a noticeable difference.
Tribes,2shtz2,socalpk,2,Fri Jan 16 05:17:54 2015 UTC,"This was just my personal opinion responding to the title of this post.   Firstly, I don't think HR has any intention to do a single thing for TA, including what you have requested, that being said, my opinion is:   If asking is going to be done, then ask for what makes the game viable not just less segregated. Newbs should at least have a somewhat viable place to learn to ski and figure out the maps and where flags and gens are etc. It is sad that some vets go in and slaughter them and perpetuate the death of this game but it is at least something, some newbs might find times when they can get a taste of how fun this game is and see the value of fighting the good fight until they can hold their own. I think the novice servers should stay.  Secondly, removing some permanent servers is ok, I guess (but not regions), I think more people might actually rent servers if they thought they'd get used but there are so many empty permanent servers of many flavors that there is little reason to actually rent one. I'd like to see HR just have a few official vanilla servers for each region and leave servers like Air Combat and 24 hour to community rented servers. I suspect HR would actually see some revenue from this too and it might actually encourage them to look at releasing those maps Kate already made. False hope I am sure but money talks more than emails, unfortunately.  Thirdly, I believe that removing the quick match is an easier and faster solution than trying to make it so it's use lands on populated severs....but I've never liked quick match at all."

I hoped on an Lt server and was just blown away how bad I was/good everyone else was. I always played a HoF role or D sniper.. so I am SUPER pumped to show up for PUG base!! Thanks so much for organizing this!
Tribes,2sg1ng,Snow_Monky,1 point,Fri Jan 16 01:13:02 2015 UTC,t1 really is an international game   even playing on an na server from aus is easy and you're more than compeitive   some of the best players would play overseas and still have great aim  remember this is a game made in 1998 with 98 netcode on computers from that time and it was meant to be played overseas back then too  you can easily get a 0-16 ping if you're playing in the same country and overseas the highest you might go is 120 which with interpolate and pft isn't going to change the game that much for you at all  the truth is with a computer that has more than 1 gig of ram (which didnt even exist on the consumer market in 98) your 120 ping will feel like a 1998 16 ping in that game. with more than 1 gig of ram it stops mattering even more. unless you end up with a 300+ping the game plays great internationally

Tribes,2scz4a,gothaggis,1 point,Wed Jan 14 13:48:52 2015 UTC,"What teamwork means to me. Well I witness teamwork everyday whether it be in school or online. 5150 is a great clan, I remember is T1 how big they used to be and people used to be scared. In TV if I get accepted I will make them even more scared with teamwork. I have seen Eldee play, Eldee is always using teamwork. Teamwork is what makes a clan great. Every one has been important since people first formed organizations to accomplish tasks too big to be performed by individuals working alone and every one will continue to be a challenge as long as people work together. That’s how things work in a organized manner.   The Challenges of Teamwork Working on teams can normally prove very challenging, with all of the variations in personalities, strengths, and weaknesses. I heard 5150 makes you feel at home no worries. Getting people together in the organization does not create a team. They have to remain together for a common goal, and for that they should have different skills. That what I think 5150 is it’s a team with a bunch of skill. The value of teamwork the team holds certain values, it develops blame-game and faultfinding strategies that ultimately destroy the team and frustrate the goal. One of the key essentials in teamwork is togetherness. If something goes wrong, no one will blame anyone. Rather, the team members would jointly mull over the problem and try to identify the pitfalls and correct them. If they succeed the honor is shared and everyone earns praise and recognition.   Team members always look up to the team leader. The team leader has to be a facilitator, inspirer, motivator, counselor, conflict resolver and a communicator. He has to be a role model for the members of the team. That’s what I think is another KEY to teamwork. The leader does not say, do this, do that. He says, Let us do this. A true leader has great appreciation and recognition for team members and teamwork. Extraordinary team building challenges that require people to explore creative solutions, practice and improve working as a team in a fun spirited atmosphere (which is when we win ). A good team also keeps in touch with other teammates. However, the effectiveness of a team is influenced by both internal and external factors. Internal factors include clear purpose, informality, participation, listening, open communication, shared leadership, consensus decisions, and clear role and task assignments. I have seen Adrenaline be a leader giving out commands for his team to be better to get more caps or more kills. Since this essay is so long I have been learning about Gandhi in school and about his leadership. Gandhi was a man who possessed three distinct qualities that every successful leader can testify to as invaluable. First, he could proclaim his message to a crowd of thousands as if he were speaking to each individual one on one. Gandhi had an incendiary sense and talent of communication which set him above everyone else. Second, Gandhi had humility. He was one of the masses; he humbled himself to the level of the common man. I am not saying 5150 does this, they are a great team but they would have to be GOD to do this =D. Trust is the most important element of a team, without it nothing happens. This is probley one of the most important quotes of Gandhi’s life time.   We wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for teamwork. Teamwork is a great thing that only great teams have, and that team is 5150. I have seen them play in servers and kick ass, that is because of there skill, teamwork and determination. Without that a team would be nothing. Throughout the worlds lifetime there has been teamwork everywhere from when Gandhi was around till now 2004. Whether its in games or in the real world teamwork isn’t different whatever your doing and how your doing it, its still teamwork. Mostly everything we do with another person is teamwork. If you’re a loner you might not know what teamwork is, but the people who get out and do stuff with people know what teamwork is and how it works. Together everyone achieves more. We are in war right now people are dieing but they are working together to overcome this tragedy. Families are working together to overcome the fact that there son and or daughter is in the war.  TV is not the real world, I know this but you can DEFINITLY use teamwork in this game I will give you a few examples. On Winterlake you can send a HO in to distract the turrets and defenders and go in grab the flag and get out of there. Or if your fighting a guy and your about to die and say eldee comes and MAs him and saves me that’s teamwork trying to stay alive. Or if your about to cap the flag and a guy kills you, so the flag is dropped and a 5150 guy gets it right before the other guy gets it, then caps it that’s teamwork. Or a 5150 guy could give you a ride on a ship over to the base so you don’t have to fly or walk, then you go and concur there base. TV is full of teamwork situations I named a few of many. I am sure 5150 uses Team speak when you tell the team that a guy is about to cap the flag so you go and kill them. On Team speak the word team is in it, so obviously you can tell that it is all about teamwork in game.   In conclusion to this 1000 word essay I would like to say I really hope I get into 5150. I really like this clan, and I think it would be the best one for me, I would never leave I am very loyal. Thank you 5150 and a special thanks to my Mom for helping me with this =DD Autoload"

Plus from this video it looks like it would have a pretty decent base counter (not that it was exactly strong in comp).  I'd say it would be a decent addition and wouldn't shun the idea at all.

Tribes,2s710m,Gierling,1 point,Tue Jan 13 01:48:14 2015 UTC,4 offensive players and a vehicle hitting the Defense all at once... That's crazy to think about.  Plus the possibility of midair high altitude flag carrier docking to enable crazy unorthodox cap moves.
Tribes,2s710m,persuasionlaser,1 point,Tue Jan 13 04:00:14 2015 UTC,"That thing's usefulness increases so much when the map is larger. Being a counter to the turrets is not that big because you have to stand still to actually hit it, then you take discs and die. Transporting offense to get clear is also not that big, since they should be able to make the time anyway and probably don't all want to be in the same place.   It would be fun as fuck to get 4 jugg's in there but it's not something for comp."
Tribes,2s710m,orthag,1 point,Tue Jan 13 08:04:30 2015 UTC,A transport vehicle that could quickly shuttle 3 or 4 players across the map and provide light aerial weapons support would be incredibly valuable. Or something that has no guns but players can fire out of.

They made the maps bigger yes, but when they did that they also decided to make all of the terrain a lot higher, which was a bad idea. They could make a huge crossfire map and it would work just fine"

Tribes,2s8ijq,Rynex,9,Tue Jan 13 10:14:54 2015 UTC,"T2 Duel  My first favorite moment would involve playing Darky^ for #1 in T2b Duel. Darky^ was already quite the legend in  non-cg duels, but he was considered by quite a margin the best dueller when cg was used. And there I was, some 15yr old brat ready to take him on in a CG duel. This duel ended up being memorable for me because I beat him, the person I looked up to the most at that time.  T2 Arena  What memorable moment followed was me playing arena with him and Etheralking on the 3v3 arena ladder. We played against the other top team at the time: Keewee, Mortalc & Piotrusek. (ex .idk?) We played on Morena where I managed to do a full clean 1v3 against the entire enemy team.   T:A  PGW Game winning cap  Even though I wasn't there due to a do-or-die exam, I do consider this as one of my favorite moments in T:A. During the week before PGW Shaz and I were messing about on Crossfire on an empty server. Due to .idk? being our main rival, we were talking about preparing some stuff if we would play against them. As Shaz tried some Back-to-front hidden Shieldpack/RDR routes, I mentioned that Shad  didn't seem to use claymore's at all. (It seemed like he opted for the more hollywood nades, for his montage maybe?)  Thinking about that, one would assume the back-to-front on Xfire would be mined by Impaler. (They did so in the past in scrims vs us) At that point in practice I went HoF and laid the most generic (through the middle) mines on the B2F path. Shaz, normally preferring nj5, would try to nj4  chain the mines down, while grabbing and getting it into midfield. (an already big accomplishment in that meta at the time) We did this for a few hours.   Who knew that exact same scenario would made us win PGW? There were many examples of our strategies trying to counter an oponent's personal playstyle, but this one was the most important and  got us the win."
Tribes,2s8ijq,Ephixx,4,Tue Jan 13 21:33:28 2015 UTC,"oh, easy to read names  yea, that xf issue was known. to me claymore are gimmicks. i hate to rely on those. in the end i got guilt tripped into using them, but that was eutl 2 or something  i rather think the hz difference i was busy trying to handle distracted me a little, so that was the better strategy. honestly i wouldnt have been able to focus on claymores anyway, so fuck them!  my worst moment: realizing a lan grand final was a bo3 after xf ended. that kind of sucked and felt interesting, because abrupt. i think i was the only one who didnt know. i just assumed it would be bo5 for some reason"
Tribes,2s8ijq,Shad_idk,1 point,Wed Jan 14 12:43:45 2015 UTC,"oh man i remember that moment, the look on your face was pretty crushing. i agree though, it should have been a bo5.  ...though i think a bo5 on those maps kinda sucked for the spectator."

My favorite moment was when after i had built my first ""gaming"" PC, i took it over to my wife's friends house. Her BF introduced me to tribes and played it with an addiction.   I set up my PC (ASUS P3F-B, Celeron Slot 1 333mhz, Viper V770 gfx card) on the coffee table, next to his and with another guy in the dining room, we got online. All 3 of us sharing a dual 56K modem connection.   I played Raindance online, on my own comp for the very first time.  That moment of crossing over the midfield gully and seeing the enemy base, (and almost instantly being gibbed) is something i will remember."

Tribes,2s8ijq,EVOLiTiLE,6,Wed Jan 14 13:21:16 2015 UTC,"In the pro scene my favorite storyline was the Vex O stack against Epi and 5150. It was the perfect battle of strategy, egos, and people having the fire to win more than anything.   For myself my favorite story was getting 55 kills and 55 assists sniping on Crossfire then being asked to ring for Vex in a scrim. This was before I was in on the comp scene and after I recently upgraded from my macbook to a pc. So it was the first moment that people started taking notice of me in a not shit way.   My favorite pug moment is a toss up between McMuffin being banned and sniping for Titan in a pug. I was a fan of his stream and we did really well together.   And finally, my favorite streaming moment was when APC used to do tournament recaps and previews live on the TA channel. I was always enthralled by the pro scene and loved hearing people's thoughts on who would win or who the better team was on certain maps. This eventually lead to me writing match previews and my short-lived show State of Play because I just really loved discussing competitive Tribes and I was frustrated that no one else was doing it yet.   If there's interest I'm happy to share more, but I don't want to make this wall any bigger."

Tribes,2s8ijq,EVOLiTiLE,8,Tue Jan 13 04:13:40 2015 UTC,"I'll talk about the months leading up to me joining Egocentric then, as I haven't touched on that yet.   Near the end of my time with Emporium is when I got my new PC and things were getting pretty weird. Pretty much half the team was good and the other half was pretty mediocre at best. They were a blast to play with, but some people wanted to be more tryhard than others and that lead to the split which included chickennwaffles, expect, and myself leaving to make a new team called Jerkcity, which eventually changed its name to Internap. This happened just a little after the Jimvitational.   This team started out really strong, we were able to beat egocentric and epidemic in scrims. We got a shoutout thread by Blitz saying we had strong talent. I was sniping until we picked up GST and rincewind. But I was really unhappy about maybe a month or a month and a half in with the team chemistry. I told chickennwaffles(the captain) when I joined that I had two rules or I would quit. The first is that we have to be active and the second is that everyone has to like everyone.   The first rule was broken a few times in my time there. GST went afk for like a week or two and didn't say anything when we were preparing for the house league in NATL. The second was when we didn't practice for six days leading up to our loss against Puppy Kisses near the end of the house league(maybe finals?).   The second rule was broken many times. I really liked rincewind, naka, and gst when he was there, but our offense was really toxic. Aeia, chicken, expect, and indiecore would rage on a regular basis. I eventually got fed up with the offense and told chicken that I was going to leave in two weeks and that I may be done with Tribes to train for a local SC2 lan(which I won). I also told him that I would join ego if I decided to come back. Interesting to note, DavidBowie said he would refuse to poach me, and would only take me in if I became teamless.   Now there was a shit ton of drama and miscommunication to come out of this. The words I conveyed to chickennwaffles did not get sent to the other teammates. So they saw me as a team hopper and seriously hated on me for it. They eventually banned me from their public and private irc, gst cursed at me in reddit threads, irc, and mumble. Their perspective towards ego was pretty shit as they thought I was poached and the whole scenario would have been avoided if chicken told the team I was leaving.   I was really happy I ended up at Egocentric. They were almost all truly great people, great sports, and pretty damn good at the game. For now I'm gonna make some food, I'll talk about why I stopped State of Play(my old show) as I never properly said why I stopped to anyone really.   edit: I actually have some of my old scrim vods of our pre rage era on my youtube, check out the playlists at the top. https://www.youtube.com/user/Rzamortis/playlists"

Tribes,2s8ijq,chickenNwaffles723,0,Sat Jan 17 17:31:46 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is actually heartbreaking to read. Almost everything you said about Internap was absolutely bullshit. How can one be this dense?  This is what really happened (or at least how my mind remembers it),  I was on Emporium, a pretty low-tier team that would never progress due to the difference in skill between most of the players. They were all really nice, genuine and cool dudes, but when it came down to playing tribes, they were not the best. I worked with them, put my best effort into the team, but eventually I just felt like the team was holding me back. So I created my own team, jerkcity in collaboration with Expect. We were pretty serious about the whole thing.  Our first pickup, if I recall correctly, was you Symtex. I don't remember a whole lot about the pickup, but I do remember that I asked you in mumble and you eventually said yes. Cool right? Later on, since we were only a team of three, we decided to pick up our capper, Mogg. Mogg was a stellar capper. He was calm, collective and a chill guy overall (the perfect capper I might add). With him, rincewind (his brother) joined. That was the arrangement, if mogg joined, rincewind had to come too. I didn't even know how good rincewind was at the time (actually I thought he would be bad and we would have to take him with Mogg and suffer). They were both amazing pickups and amazing people. Next, was Aeia, our fourth offense player. He wasn't the greatest mechanically, but he understood the game and was a super cool dude to talk to, and the was the only guy we had to pick from. I was super excited when I got Slyce on the team, because of how good of a player he was, but due to scheduling overlaps with his job, he almost never showed up to practice and barely played. Last, but not least was gst. Holy shit was gst amazing. The most relaxed russian point-click god I have ever met. Awesome dude I have to say. He was super dedicated to being on an American team and he worked very hard despite the time difference between him and us.  Internap, like you said, started out strong. We did better than I every imagined. Everyone was very dedicated. We practiced hard and consistently to try and improve all the time. Aeia and I would stay up really late, theory crafting and strategizingabout. Not once did I doubt our team chemestry, as we all were just a bunch of friends playing tribes. I had some of the best moments in tribes on that team. Everyone had a great sense of humor and we all seemed to get along really well.  Now, here is where the story starts to deviate a little bit from what you have stated. It might be the fact that I just don't fully remember how our team was or I just might be lying to myself. However, I don't recall you stating your ""two rules"", or being very vocal to me about anything of that matter. However, everyone on the team was active (except for gst who got eaten buy a russian bear for a week) and very friendly towards one another. We were like any tribes team. We loved to play tribes together, joke around and have fun. I would get mad and frustrated (as anyone playing tribes would) at times, but so would aeia, rince, hell even mogg would get upset and start bitching. I mean, it is literally a side affect of playing tribes. However, the way you portray our team, is completely exaggerated. We all put our best effort into the team and wanted to succeed as much as anyone else would have, thus, when things weren't going our way, we got upset and made it clear we were upset (mostly the offense, you are correct about that). That's what happens when you care about something and put a lot of effort into it. When you see that if your guys were just a little bit better at chaining or were just a bit more on time to the flag, that you would have won that match, you get frustrated (especially as a captain).  You, worked as hard as anyone else, and when you told us that you would be leaving tribes to play for your starcraft tournament, we got set back quite a bit after that. Before you left, our defensive setup was: you and rince (double ld), and gst. Our offense was: Me, Aeia (sniper bitch) and sylce, Expect if he couldn't make it. After you left, we felt like our defense was fucked, but picking up Naka made things a whole lot better. But, the team was ok with you leaving, and we didn't hate you or despise you. I don't recall any miscommunications between you and the rest of the team and, well to be honest, we still liked you (I did at least).  This all changed however. Shortly, well almost instantly, after your ""retirement"" or break, whatever you may call it. You joined egocentric and were on their roster. To us, you were going to leave for pretty long time to practice sc, and THEN join ego. That was fucking alright, but when you showed up on their roster right after you left, we got pissed. If you really wanted to fucking leave and join ego, you should of just told us. I value honesty above anything else, if you were to just have told me, things would be much different.  That's why there was a lot of toxicity towards you. You fucking team hopped and you refuse to admit it to this day. Stop trying to justify it please, it's insulting. Shortly after you left, we picked up Naka an outstanding hof for the time he was on the team and indiecore (we might have got him earlier, but I don't remember). We continued playing for long time, before many of our member started to become inactive and eventually our team sort-of disbanded. Rincewind kept most of the team together, while I was on a hiatus, and made Knightron. Props to him, he became a kick ass ld.  The point I am trying to hopefully somewhat make clear, is that, although our offense could get upset, frustrated and quite toxic. We still were a great team and group of friends. Never once did I ever dislike anyone on the team. Same goes for everyone on the team. It is only human to get upset, but the way you portray our offense is far too ""overboard"". Mogg almost never got upset, gst was no bullshit and only spoke about the game. He was the most quiet and funny motherfucker ever. Rincewind was super chill, for the most part and so were you. Me, Aiea and expect would get mad often, but by no means were we as pessimistic as you said. You fail to explain to everyone here all the great times we had and how we were a pretty fucking awesome team.  I for one loved team Internap and all of its members. I always have. I still am friends with everyone on the team. I will never forget that team, the amount of time and effort I put into it and all the great times I had playing with those dudes. It truly was something special.  Please Symtex, don't spread bullshit like this. If you truly that bothered by the attitude of members on the team, then why the fuck didn't you just say it?  Also, I was actually pretty upset at the egocentric dudes for the whole teamhop thing, but shortly after playing a shit ton of rust with them, I found myself loving them. Super nice guys, davidbowie is a total bro."
Tribes,2s8ijq,Symtex123,5,Wed Jan 14 02:57:51 2015 UTC,"Hokay so I'm going to quote the things that I disagree with and you should just assume everything else that I ignore that I agree with.   However, I don't recall you stating your ""two rules"", or being very vocal to me about anything of that matter.   I understand that you may not remember this, but this is something that I did tell you the day I joined. If it helps you remember, I jokingly said this was my contract at the time.   However, the way you portray our team, is completely exaggerated.    I'm specifically going to be talking about two weeks or so before I left. Expect every single time he played would bitch about his ping every few minutes. Whenever Indiecore would get shutdown repeatedly, he would bitch. Aeia would rage in nearly every single hard game we would play. You yourself would consistently being saying things on the lines of ""How did you guys let this happen?"" or ""How are we losing to them?"" in very aggressive condescending tones. This environment was fucking shit to play with and I was sick of it. Note I'm not calling out everyone on the team and saying you guys were not great friends or were all ragers, I just had serious problems with the team and I was not enjoying my team(edit time*) there at all. I feel like this accurately depicts what was going on and was reflected in a minimized version in my op and would not say this was sensationalized.    Shortly after you left, we picked up Naka   I actually played a few games with him on iNap. Not really that important or relevant though.    If you truly that bothered by the attitude of members on the team, then why the fuck didn't you just say it?   I did in several cases, both in IRC and in mumble. I don't have recordings or vods of this though, so that kinda ends there.   This all changed however. Shortly, well almost instantly, after your ""retirement"" or break, whatever you may call it. You joined egocentric and were on their roster.   This happened I believe 2-3 days after I left. I genuinely felt like I was going to be done with Tribes and wrote up that gbye post. But I really wasn't enjoying SC2 as much as I thought I would have and was hanging out a lot in ego's mumble and it happened naturally. I never intended to use SC2 as a scapegoat to leave iNap and I don't think I could ever convince y'all otherwise, but that's how it honestly went down.   As a quick ending note, I had no bad intentions with my original post. I was just interested in telling a story. Also if Aeia reads this, I'm sorry I was being such a shithead to you during later matches. I always felt kinda guilty as I felt that may have been a contributing factor to cause you to leave comp."

I totally forgot about that.  Agree about Expect being very negative.  He got like 50 kills in that epic game on permafrost vs (nV?) and still managed to talk about how ""awful"" he played.  He was really only negative towards himself though and is a very nice kid.  Always happy to hear from him once in a blue moon.

I have no idea why you go full retard and blame something on chicken, when in reality you came to mumble and told all of us that you are quiting tribes. I never cursed you, all i did was mute you and remove from friends because you acted like a scumbag to team. Ill share this post of yours with rince and mogg and other ppl from that team to see their reaction, you are really a piece of shit.

It felt really rewarding being first in eu to use knives in comp and bonus of having knutsson as first sent target was great. I think that was the game http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgjbsIlaZW8 :D"

Even during the two week period where I said I wanted to quit I still played for you guys. I rang for ego once in my time with you guys. In my post above, I said I told chicken that I was quitting and if I was going to return, that I was going to join ego. If you go through old reddit posts you can certainly find posts of you raging at me. And to the point of you saying you didn't disappear for a bit ask mogg/rince/chicken about the time we were joking about you fighting a bear."

Now you blame chicken))))))))))))), god fucking awful trash you are, you came into mumble and TOLD US, me, mogg, rince that you quit tribes and go train sc2 only, then 1 day before natl we see you in ego roster and actually find out you already trained with them at the time when you were claiming to train for sc2. No point to blame chicken for something that you supposedly said to him, while you said to me, rince, mogg (cant remember if anyone else were in the mumble that time) that you quit tribes and train sc2 only. Worst part of it, i long ago forgot about tribes and you in particular, its quite hilarious that even after a year+, when nobody remembers anything about it, you still are so insecure about yourself that you have to prove everyone else was the reason you lost something, everyone except you ofcourse. We didnt have strongest team or anything, but i would never blame my teammates for my own mistakes or team losing, nor do i remember any hate / toxicity in our team at any point in the time. You are like a murcan version of demonsnail, damn this thread, made me remember symtex and demonsnail actually existed. You were a good ld, but you acted like a piece of shit and deserved every single comment about you scumbagging us. Never had anything against ego, so dont bother trying to say i didnt like them or whatever, only person in ego we and me in particular ever had something against was you after your teamhop."

But to your point, this is just a casual share your story thread, I'm not really showing any insecurity, and I never anywhere in my post said anything about us losing. I just said I was unhappy with how inactive we were and how toxic the offense was. You really seem to just be grasping at straws here.  edit: Actually I did at one point say I was upset that we lost to Puppy Kisses in NATL, but the part I was upset about was that we didn't practice for like a week leading up to it."

Gave link to this topic to chicken, hopefully he will give it to rince / mogg aswell so they take a look at 'your vision' of things; i myself find you quite a disgusting loser, who is so insecure about himself that he still, after a year+ tries to justify his lies in a videogame subreddit."

Especially the Finals, when all would be watching, (several thousand viewers) commenting on plays , the cast, commentators, etc...   It was just fun.   The different metas discussed from different regions.   The back and forths .   Watching behind the blue plate and discussing what's going on with Tribes on a weekly basis.   We had a strong dedicated following.   I wish Hirez, would have stuck with us. At least a small dedicated team working on maps, bugs and customizations to keep the community going.   Those were the good times. Back when we pushed each other to get better and work together.   The comradery we had as Tribers.   All of it as a whole back in mid 2012.  There was so much to look forward to.   I never found myself so excited with a game.   T:A, made me feel like a kid again.   Lol, I really looked up to certain players as Pros. And valued their opinions. Even though I was (am) older and have done and seen more in my life. But, to me they were it. They were the Pros. I haven't ever felt that way since I was like 12,or even earlier.   Sad I know, lol.   But I enjoyed those times. I miss those times.   I can't wait to get a new pc.   Story time over.

I personally have never seen or heard of something such as it before, that was created by the community, for the community, in following of a game.   I loved it.   It helped you feel like you were apart of something.   Cause, to be honest. And, I know it's my personal opinion. But, it's also the only one that matters. :P lol  But despite its flaws. T:A is/was the best damn game ever made. And, everyone knew it. You could feel it. That excitement.   Unfortunately though,   Hirez let us down. Hard.   Tossed aside to jump on the coat-tails of League and Dota.   Ultimately for money reasons (understandable).   But they had the game to really put them on the map.   And, now COD, and several other games are moving into a Tribes direction.   The movement, teamwork, etc...  That made Tribes stand out among the rest.   All they had to do was support it.

If it got 1 million with a bad studio, just think about how many they could've had if it was with a proper studio, or if hirez changed their ways.  Even after all that hirez did to it, as long as there were hills, skiing, jetpacks, and spinfusors, people still played it.  And that's because, at it's core, it's still tribes.

Sure we don't have the newest stuff, and we have a couple issues here and there, but in the end, I'd rather live in a small town. My favourite moment, was by far, was when I pubbed 1 match in stonehenge as a level 18 genlyf against mstarr, doterow, and kindagamey in the same match...  I used to think I was good, then, those 3 completely destroyed me, and after that, I was inspired to get good.  The simple fact, that I was playing in the same match as mstarr my role model, someone that I'd seen rek people in videos before, and that now, he was rekking me, it's so unique.

AU comp was always pretty toxic; I only even started playing at around the same time high-level comp here died (i.e. the Immunity cup tournament), and even from then til when comp died we went through three different mumble servers... ultimately Zooster had to host one himself so that we could play pugs, because different people were banned on both existing mumbles.    But once comp died the pug community was surprisingly pretty civil, and even though everyone was bad for the most part it was pretty fun.    What I'm trying to say is: rip in au pugs."

I reckon most of the better fraggers would outfrag just about everyone from when comp was alive.

Tribes,2s8ijq,sh4z,2,Wed Jan 14 22:45:22 2015 UTC,"The first NASL tournament, we literally had just recruited a team of pub players (none of us being white listed or whatever that was) and signed up.  It was fun having all the tribes veterans ranking teams based on performance and history etc.  This was special because this was the first time I was able to start playing competitively at the start of what seemed to be a promising long-lasting tribes title.  (t1 I was late to party on 56k, t2 was meh, t:v I was there but the game comp. died immediately imo, so here we were...)  We were able to beat VuP in a snooze fest which was important cause VuP had a long history of tribes and then went on to get utterly stomped by Tao and then getting eliminated by OWA.  Next up, Another tourney, again we are now a few weeks or maybe months into competitive play - already having player erosion.  We were to face idk? in the starting round and being oblivious to the euro scene and the majority of the NA top tier - we thought maybe the tournament hosters were giving us a ""fair"" match-up.  So, the team practices for a few and then we effectively train showboating moves - how to ride shrikes, all this dumb stuff.    Shit only got real when w1nters came in our mumble asking for info. and we asked him what he could tell us about the other team.  He thoroughly informed us that we were likely going against the #1 across all regions.  Needless to say, we got stomped.  Next up, dL vs OWA - I re-watched the game cast the other day and was such a great game and potential grudge match.  OWA had some of the best raw talent imo at the time with muhktar, cowflare, broccoli, snooks, lowradio (I had to include him, he reads reddit :) )  The game had zero stand-offs and went into OT 6-5 each map.  Next up, dL vs Rev newblooods - one of the best and most fun matches played ever.  Only downfall was that we didn't win and Rev were white-out grenade spammers! (those grenades were the only part of the tournament that made no sense...)  Lastly, Any tournament we played after our roster stopped changing and that we didn't have player / connection issues which usually led to huge upsets."

Tribes,2s8ijq,sh4z,1 point,Wed Jan 14 13:14:57 2015 UTC,"Tribes 1 demo I was around 11 years old, and the tribes 1 demo was included in a PC Gamer magazine that I bought. It was the first time I ever tried playing any game online, and I got totally devoured by it. It was like nothing I've ever played before, huge outdoor maps and so many loadouts and options to explore, 28.8k modem and my familys phone bill sky rocketed, but it was all worth it the day I learned how to ski, hitting that spacebar key like crazy. Freedom.  T:A The best moments for me in matches were both from PGW. The one Ephix already described getting a cap out on Crossfire using a quite silly raider self-clearing mines with nj4 trick that we had been working on just for the LAN finals, and the mid-air and return on Crysta that miri brought up.   Outside of playing, I strongly remember when I was getting approached by both working as intended and heartbreakers to join their teams. I was on Grumpy old veterans at the time, and although we were a decent team with some awesome dudes we were never close to the top (at the time idk?, hindsight, WAI and uE), there was quite a huge gap from those teams to the rest (and also between hindsight/idk? and wai/uE).  So one day nvc started talking to me about joining wai, and I instantly got the jitters. Since I started playing and watching T:A in beta it was always my goal to play and compete with the top teams. He said there were already sponsors being talked to, and the possibilty to even get a team house in the future. Just as I was about to tell GoV I would leave to join WAI, bins approached me and said hindsight was disbanding, and some of the players were starting up the new team heartbreakers.  There I was, being approached by two of the best teams, one even having a foot in with sponsors already. Don't think I slept that night, as I had to make a choice where I would go, also feeling pretty crappy about leaving my old team.  Finally I decided to go with bins, and heartbreakers, and it was probably the best choice of my T:A career. No sponsors or team-houses ever came to WAI, meanwhile (after a few roster changes, and a lot of bins yelling at me to step up my game) we managed to win the PGW lan with -3-."

Tribes,2s8ijq,Etheralking,5,Thu Jan 15 18:50:30 2015 UTC,"The good old days of ""early"" T;A is just full of wonderful memories. A more innocent time and even if there were a lot of setbacks it was always taken with ease, because back then we all felt like it could all be fixed... should and would be fixed, even. I remember my innocent pubstar days before my first PUGs, where I started out as some goof not understanding anything, struggling to hit the ground. I remember seeing some guy disc jump and freaking out. Both because I'd been so stupid for not thinking of that (we all know of rocket jumping from other games) and from how cool and awesome it was. Remember getting the scrambler unlocked and thinking it was the ultimate class. It had the best weapons, it could run routes, duel anything and still infiltrate and wreak havoc in the enemy base. I mostly played scrambler until I could reliably mid air with the arx buster, but since they were so gosh darned bugged I had to move on (when more of half of your hitting mid airs doesn't register any damage it just gets frustrating). I remember getting 100+ midairs after that, because doombringer mines gave air mails if the player they killed were in the air and back then everyone in pubs were stupid. It wasn't rare for me to be the only one (or one of just a few) on a server of 32 people not playing pathfinder and just like that I just accidentally started playing the objective and winning games on purpose... not just running around and killing stuff and sometimes just happen to win. I remember when classes came and people started playing other stuff. I remember Adrius infing against me and how wonderful the HoF vs inf relationship can be, how he'd just do everything in his power to troll, distract and outwit me to save his cappers. How I learned to predict infs, visualise and predict and aim. I remember the constant discussions and the plethora of large texts I wrote on the HiRez forums. How I started to play to lead the pub teams. How I'd choose classes, roles and playstyles to force the teams to play well. How I'd shape the entire PUB I was in consciously and how seriously I took it all...  and I remember my reluctance when Fleur tried to drag me into the reddit PUGs. Even though the PUB play had grown stagnant, even though I was confident I was a really, really good player of pubs. How they nagged at me for so very long to join in on it, but I've never been much of a social gamer and even playing an online game like T;A in pubs is something I've usually stayed away from. And when Fleur finally managed to drag me into a PUG I expected to get stomped. Even if I was good, these were the real players. The pros.  And I got picked as HoF and I remember the condescending questioning I got when they noticed I ran HBL. I remember the belittling chuckles from the enemy team and the annoyed ""Ugh!""s from my own. I remember we played X-Fire and Arx. I remember how hectic, pressured and adrenal it was compared to a PUB. How hard I stomped JP that tried to cap against me. How complimented and redeemed I felt at the warm sincerity of his insults afterwards(I believe ""fucking cunt muncher"" were the words of choice that evening). We played for hours and I realised that I wasn't too shabby, even compared to these real players. I think I was the highest ranked one, being in the high golds. And somehow me and these guys got along (I hadn't laughed that much in months) and like three in the morning we kind of made a team and somehow I, the new kid, got to play on it and that's been a hell of a ride. (Fun note: This is around when I got myself a new mouse.)  I remember playing a casted scrimm against some new team and how Fleur called me a ""a fat little pelican"" afterwards, because apparently I'd been called a fat little pillock, but apparently he didn't know what it was. We joked about that for hours, joked that we should name our team the ""the Pelicans"" and all have clan tags that were different parts of a bird([BEAK], [WING],[FEET],[BODY],[TAIL] etc.)... and together, we would assemble an entire pelican, but the name should just be ""Pelican"". We joked that we should all be different birds and we all googled ""birds with four letters"" at the same time, found the same Yahoo answers page at the same time and we tried to tell the rest of the guys about it at the same time, only to realise what had happened. And somehow, at three in the morning and drunk on laughter (when all of our important decisions were made) we became Pelican. How we decided we should make a pod-cast (a flock of pelicans is called a pod) and so on. I love those guys. That should be soon before we were invited to PGW for the ESL Europe finals, but realised we couldn't go.  And that's around when T;A started stagnating completely. Players started leaving, everyone had issues with their rosters, the upper ranks of Gameshrine stood still for months and when the community kind came out the other end of that process we kind of got to where we are now. We carried on with the routines, but even if it was fun and rewarding, it didn't have a magical shimmer and glow around it anymore... and we never did make that podcast."
Tribes,2s8ijq,saturntribes,3,Tue Jan 13 12:14:10 2015 UTC,"early on for me it was taking the step up from being on sub-top tier teams in tribes 2 to joining hindsight and forcing my way in to the main lineup (we had quite a big roster in the beginning), playing in the show matches vs. idk? where we tried out a bunch of crazy stuff and feeling like i really belonged at that level was a great feeling.  then, of course, starting -3- and leading the team on to winning PGW was really special. one particular moment always comes back to me and that was sh4z's incredible play on katabatic:  http://www.twitch.tv/smitegame/b/338086022?t=57m03s  we were totally in control, 4 caps up and then we give away a silly cap to make it 4-1, then another for 4-2. with about 4mins left we were all too aware of idk's comeback potential and their momentum, we began to get nervous because we knew how huge winning the first game would be - because even if we lost on idk's map choice in the 2nd game, the decider would be our map and we felt pretty much unbeatable on crossfire - with the clock on 3mins, crysta makes a shrike grab and in my mind i can just see the 4-3 before it even happens and then the last 2mins would be extremely difficult. then sh4z swoops in and the rest is history. when that happened i knew we'd win. we should really have won arx but nerves got the better of us and idk werre incredibly strong on that map, so fair play to them.  really hope there'll be more memories to make in the future, not a day goes by where i don't miss playing tribes."
Tribes,2s8ijq,TAWriggles,2,Wed Jan 14 11:29:57 2015 UTC,"My favourite Tribes moment was and still is, whenever I can play Tribes 2 duel against someone really good. Win or lose, it doesn't matter. It's just... awesome.  But to mention a specific moment, I guess it was when our team of friends in late Tribes 2, Team Synergy, won our first game.  For Tribes: Ascend I guess it would be winning against idk? at Paris Games Week, arms still jelly from nervousness, knowing that it would be the biggest deal in EU T:A history. Pretty sad, really. But it felt good standing there with the team, victorious :)"

Tribes,2s8ijq,LittleAscended,2,Wed Jan 14 07:09:20 2015 UTC,"additional to my previous reply, didn't realise people were adding stuff from the other games... soooo:  t2 base - taking #1 on the 10v10 ladder with -99- from flatliners was incredible, flatliners were a legendary team and we worked so hard to get #1 with a team made up mostly of unknown players who just wanted it that much that we put in the hours to make our team better than the sum of its parts. this taught me a lot and thinking back it really makes up a big part of my approach to gaming, the way we worked so hard in -3- etc.  funnily enough, we were knocked off #1 by my future teammates - hindsight, then still as ET (the core of which became hindsight).  t2 classic - playing as a smurf for an undisclosed team against idk? taught me a lot about what i needed to improve to really mix it with the best players. got a real rush out of playing well as an unknown against incredible players.  t2 cluster - getting recruited by Mc| massively improved me as a player, playing alongside crea (who obviously played for our biggest rivals in t:a) and an insanely talented roster i had my demos ripped to shreds by tang, krib and siex. can't thank those guys enough for teaching me an incredible amount about playing my position. best moment was winning the final t2 cluster tournament, but we had a lot of good times.  and finally an enormous shout to all the fun moments we had with the #clustermixed guys, we kept t2 alive for such a long time after many others gave up and we always had great games. lov3, pio, hanhi, crea, mim, tang, geto, piece, nembot.. so many names, my memory fails me."
Tribes,2s8ijq,ArmoredPenguin94,2,Wed Jan 14 14:37:33 2015 UTC,"Fav moments was being in my original clan and when I took part in the newbloods tournament.  My original clan was a blast. We were a goofy bunch of shitters. Nothing note worthy but we at least knew the basics of playing the objective and that alone gave us the edge against pubbies (also rustling their feathers was a hoot.) but as Hi-Rez kept fucking up they left one by one until we were but a memory. Today I wander the Wilderzone, the last regular of my tribe. Once a blue moon I see someone with our tag and I remember the good times.  The tournament was a blast I was so nervous that I wouldn't cut it, but my captain was an awesome and supportive guy. We did our best after some hiccups we made as far as we could. I would later get some invites to join house league teams but turned them down due to time constraints. I look back and would what it would be like to have been in comp if I had the time then."
Tribes,2s8ijq,justMupp,2,Tue Jan 13 05:54:21 2015 UTC,"Man, the new bloods tournament was an absolute blast, I'd probably put it up there as one of my favorite experiences in tribes too, was just amazing at the time, as someone completely new to tribes to get in there and have our games cast. We only won like 1 or 2 games the whole tournament, but it was still amazingly fun."
Tribes,2s8ijq,ArmoredPenguin94,3,Tue Jan 13 06:15:34 2015 UTC,"So many good moments.   Jumping in the pug mumble for the 2nd time ever for a Newblood team forming event, then playing for hours. Last pug was a mix (since most of the newly re-formed team Shazzers went to bed) at 5 am. Shaz was on my team, and he was p much the most famous EU player at the time. That pug was amazing, even if me & gerard were absolute shit on D.   Winning a draft tournament with a team that I picked. It is a satisfying feeling, let me tell ya.   Beating team UK on Arx in overtime and leading 1-0 on raindance for 10 minutes or so was pretty fun. Considering our team was a rag-tag group of high-ping Spaniards and Balkanbros. We were supposed to get smashed 7-0 like on the first map, Kata. But a combination of them taking the foot off the gas, thinking they'd beat us anyway, Yods & Nark disconnecting occasionally and us actually playing well made that we beat them in style, with a flagpass/punt train in overtime that was a thing of beauty. And then we do the stupidest tactic ever at the start on Raindance,  1 O, 4 caps, no sniper. Somehow it works, I distract Impaler while damaging the forcefield, which allows Necro to get out and eventually cap it, after jp gave us 3 heart attacks with his Inf cheese.   Casting the EUTL S2 house league finals with Mupp and Sadstic, while Mupp was playing Jazz in the background. Most fun I've had casting. Casting anything with phr33ky a close second tho. He has so much energy.  All those team moments, in defeat or victory, or just chatting, were great. Shazzers, MalVersation, Method & BalkanSiesta. Good times & great guys for the most part.   Watching Behind the Blue Plate almost every week, then actually being a guest on it. Three times in a row, for various reasons. I'm pretty sure I nearly cried when it was the last episode."

I'm still angry about it, not that you won or anything, that was fine, just still angry about how bad and inconsistent my internet has been every time I played comp T:A."
Tribes,2s8ijq,paskeluoja,3,Fri Jan 16 00:53:20 2015 UTC,"Got a few.  First was discovering the game. I had played Tribes: Aerial Assault on my friend's PS2 wayyyyy back when and it was my favourite game, and it promptly disappeared from my radar for probably 10 years, then I discovered T:A in April 2012. Played a whole shitload of Capture and Hold, literally my first 24 levels on my account were played as BRT on C&H, and then I started playing CTF.   I was converted.   There is still a large spot in my heart for C&H but CTF was where it's at (obviously). I became obsessed with the TA forums, reading every single post, making sure every thread was read, and refreshing a few times an hour to watch them all light up again and do more reading. I started planning XP gainz and how to most efficiently spend them, and generally became more and more aware of the overall Tribes scene, both a lot larger, and smaller than I initially thought.  Still being a pubbie, I found I bore a strong resemblance to the CAS mission statement and became one of the first CASi members. Our clan/community Axon channel was where I spent the majority of my time, meeting new people who joined, spending long hours in pubs blink-chasing, hanging out with my new internet friends, helping me procrastinate through the last few years of a finance degree.   CAS became my life, and a competition team was started for S3. Being a baddie I was second string, and my very first comp match I crashed O on Raindance, accidentally grabbed the flag, missed the throw back to the stand and completely fucked up our capper's first run. #yolo  CAS comp then died shortly thereafter as S3 wound down, mstarr raged, Spergmas ruined Tribes, then S4 of NATL came around and I decided I wanted to be serious about comp. I became a full-fledged CAS member, captain of the comp team, and poured my heart and soul into my little team of ragtag pubbies. Mindflayr and I spent hours and hours talking about rosters, strategies, and reviewing past footage. Mstarr and I spent hours and hours watching my VODs, game-VODs that my faithful benched members would record with team audio, and team-member VODs when everyone started recording. Though thoroughly the opposite of everything CAS stood for in-game, I can't thank mstarr enough for his support, his desire to make me a better player (and dueler), a better captain, for buying me a new mouse when mine kicked the can, and just being an all-round great guy. <3 /u/manbra  Leading my team to victory over ACD in our first match as a team, losing the first two maps and winning the third was exhilarating; and in our final game of the season, making ACD uninstall because my ragtag team of pubbies came together to beat them, laughing our asses off at the ridiculous strategies we were pulling off, never caring about being slaughtered by every other team, just having a great time as ACD admitted defeat and turtled our flag in our gens because they need 2 get gud.  Season 5 was bittersweet but I got to captain again, with Puppy CASes, got to meet more of the community, the veteran players who wanted a casual comp team wanted on MY team, and it was simply fantastic.  I regret not getting more involved in competition and newblood tournaments earlier in my Tribes career, and I truly wish everything could have kept going (I actually have something in mind, I'll keep y'all posted), but the memories and friendships this game has afforded me are priceless, treasured, and I'll always love each and every one of you assholes.  ;_;7"

How the hell is he supposed to play tribes when he is restricted from touching the flag? It is ridiculous and everyone knows we cannot afford to lose any remaining pug players to silly reasons by people that are way too serious."
Tribes,2s3p2f,Clemsonguy2091,8,Mon Jan 12 00:16:53 2015 UTC,"While I think it's out of hand and he definitely shouldn't be permabanned, I remember it being really annoying saying, 10-30 times a pug (in game chat and going over to the other team's mumble channel), that freewill can't cap because he's way too warpy. Then ending up with absolutely zero response every single time (literally not even a ""no"" in reply), even when the other team had other people that cap. That was quite a while ago though, before he started playing offense at all (haven't pugged in like 4 months other than yesterday so I'd have no idea what's going on with this stuff)"
Tribes,2s3p2f,CallShenanigans,2,Mon Jan 12 00:34:15 2015 UTC,"He has been playing offense lately.  Offense players have to touch flags every now and then, but I have not seen him play a dedicated capper role in a very long time."
Tribes,2s3p2f,Clemsonguy2091,3,Mon Jan 12 00:42:31 2015 UTC,"i'm not against freewill grabbing the flag, even sniped against him a few times, but sometimes his warp is just so bad that it's impossible to hit him.  He says can't tell if he is warping but he lies so he can continue to cap and we have to force him to stop. On offense freewill is like a lost puppy, I tried to teach him the most basic methods but shows little to no improvement or even effort to improve. Banning freewill is obviously over the top, but I'm just tired of being nice to freewill and it's difficult for anyone not to be frustrated knowing your going to lose because your playing 6v7.   Maybe tasty can teach him how to nova colt in 24/7 stonehenge."

Tribes,2s3p2f,DrunkenJediKnight,4,Mon Jan 12 00:35:11 2015 UTC,"It's true, I've also had freewill come to me and ask me to sub when the teams were uneven.  They really shouldn't ban over something he can't control, like internet connection, and telling him to straight up not touch the flag is basically impossible in tribes.  Just finish the match and tell him to come back when his internet is better.  No need at all to permaban."

Tribes,2s5k3c,DortmunderJungs,7,Mon Jan 12 10:44:38 2015 UTC,"This is moreso a problem with T:A rather than with Tribes itself. Though for good reason, essentially anything that would create tactical diversity or tactical advantages was banned in T:A.  In some way the pre-ban meta and gameplay was alot more fun that it has been since the bans. There was alot more variety of choices people could make. Certain teams played certain styles. While increasing the skill required, those bans also dumbed gameplay down by forcing a seemingly one dimensional playstyle.  In the previous games the maps made the gameplay alot more interesting. There were indeed some maps with objectives in the middle, though iirc they weren't very popular.  I wouldn't be fond of some type of MOBA-esque advantage though. In the end it's about CTF and not about who controls the objective. Instead of thinking about something like that it would be better to think about improving gameplay in other areas."
Tribes,2s5k3c,Ephixx,1 point,Mon Jan 12 11:00:26 2015 UTC,"yeah i know it's still ctf, but the diversity of stratgies wich come around small buffs you can get from global objectives should bring a whole new tactical aspect to the game wich we really could need. yeah sure we need to work on different gameplay areas, but i think we can fight the linearity pretty well with it"
Tribes,2s5k3c,manbra,5,Mon Jan 12 12:08:38 2015 UTC,"tribes 1 and 2 had those kinds of maps.  The reason t;a doesn't have much strategy is because it's a poorly designed abomination, not because the tribes series isn't capable of it"

Tribes,2s5k3c,ArmoredPenguin94,4,Mon Jan 12 19:38:04 2015 UTC,"Sounds like your ideal tribe game needs a strong injection of Tribes 2 in it.  Vastly more map variety (thx, physics), better vehicle system, destroyable base assets (vpad & inventories) and naked spawn with base rape all made for a more tactical and much more varied game in terms of possible playstyles with more varied in-game choices on how to play out a given gamestate.  It might not have been as obvious as ""hold this switch for a potential advantage"" (those kind of maps existed too, though they really weren't of the comp variety), but the choices are still there - just a bit more subtle."

Not so much against you though, when you happen to smurf against me on a pub or in a pug. :)  I can only think of two people I've played with, who are able to stay so calm and collected at all times: Impaler and you.

You clearly don't have that problem.  I have huge respect for the way you play and pick those challenging shots and moves, and I think that's why you have become extraordinary at the game.  On to the video. The editing, music and clips added up to an awesome montage. I saw no major mistakes in almost 30 minutes of editing.   You're a machine.  I wish you the best in whatever you will be doing, and I hope we meet again in the future.  Stay safe."

Tribes,2s1mzk,TheFatCupcakes,0,Sun Jan 11 22:18:39 2015 UTC,"Dont take this offensive, but i think this montage is again the proof why you always were one of the best players in the world, but not THE best player in the world. 2:29 for example. I think everyone else wouldve just shoot their whole magazine without stopping on tumi. But you however are smart enough to stop and wait for him to be in a perfect line to finish him off with your last shots. This is extremly smart and is just one example of your intelligent gameplay. But i think this is also why you never were the best player. I would compare it to Henrik Mkytharian in Dortmund. He is too smart for the game. He thinks to much and then makes a couple of bad/too late decissions. Other players like Matin just dont think about what they do, they do what feels right to them, they have a special feeling to the game, you however always search for the best possible way, wich mostly turns into great things, but never is as good as having that special drive like a player like matin has.

There are multiple people that have started and polished their ideas when on our team.   Soldier cross capping from Bowie/Qualm, then perfected by the likes of Tasty and Soni.   Mine placements started by Mstarr, but with great help with Qualm and Sweetness.  Longer energy pack/skybox routes pioneered by Ibin and Pessimisstick, later the devote Hooty/Xan variants.   Juggernaut HoFing inspired by early on Alchemy HoFing, really took it to the next level after a year of tireless practice. Though it has to be said that Vir was technically the first jug HoF, he stopped using it long before chain/discs came out.

But on the other hands its hard to compare different teams at different stages of the game and in the meta and how they played it. A same roster can be the best team in one meta and completly fall behind in another one.  I would say that PGW Heartbreakerz are one of the best teams. These coordinated doublecaps from bins and sh4z are out of control; Knuttson COMPLETLY outplays topskrt by positioning. It's such a pleasure to watch, idk? being awesome aswell, srsly guys watch that game. It's perfect. Makes me cry.  I also think that S2 idk? is just too sick. Matin Shad T00l in one team just should not happen. They deserved that win and can be considered as one of the best of all time.

Deadstop 4 life).  Sure, later teams could probably beat them but at the time they were clearly the best of the best.  They razzle-dazzled their jazz hands pretty much every match with their shrike passes and other shithole-clenching shenanigans.  They weren't afraid to try that stuff.  Other teams were simply boring to watch in comparison."
Tribes,2rznoi,evanvolm,2,Sat Jan 10 20:27:03 2015 UTC,"I'm biased having been a part of the team, but even practices and scrims felt like next level shit vs what we were seeing from the rest of the TA community at the time.  Obviously it helped that most of the team had played together in legions.    I honestly think with a few exceptions that Proj's various lineups actually had more individual skill (at least when it came to pewpew), but they really had pretty straightforward and rarely inventive strats.  It was rinse repeat over and over when watching them, while ds switched things up quite a lot during the course of a match.    I think mabel and fire are two of the best d to have played the game, but honestly I think versatility is what made DS so good in those early days.  Players like diplo (before he left the game) were unreal and hugely underrated.  He was the first guy I saw who could get 100 kills and multiple slayers in snipe, tank, doom, jugg, etc.  He would also regularly change class, positioning, etc mid match/scrim and end up basically determining matches as a result.  Gotta give blitz his due for tactics and dedication as well, taking multiple teams throughout the game to the top.  It also didnt hurt having players as skilled as rock, frost, etc as basically practice squad, who could fill in at a few positions competently.  Euros obviously had some great teams as well, and better individual players in some positions without a doubt."

Manually blow out the entire installation folder and delete the registry key above and reinstall. You should be good to go after that.  EDIT: InstallationLocation will give you the location of the HiRez Studios installation folder. If you have the steam version installed use the Install Source line to find the actual tribes installation directory. Steam will have it installed in a different location from the typical HiRezStudios/HiRezGames/TribesAscend data structure.

Tribes,2rxdlx,qhp,2,Sat Jan 10 02:55:28 2015 UTC,The year we finally realized that you can just inf slide all day long and we should ban inf.
Tribes,2rxdlx,pard0n99,2,Sat Jan 10 05:41:00 2015 UTC,"I still don't think INF capping was a huge issue, PTH chase (US meta at the time) is a natural counter IMO."
Tribes,2rxdlx,qhp,5,Sat Jan 10 05:52:34 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand how it could be a natural counter.  Maybe if you are talking about someone literally only going for inf slides the whole map, not helping with fragging etc. But the thing is, the inf has the luxury of deciding to grab or not, the PTH has to be stuck in a chase loadout 24/7 to counter it.   The way inf sliding was going was that, you'd set up to do the grab, and only take it if the roam was out of position or playing or soldier, if he was at stand in PTH, you'd just stop and clear for your capper, which was easy since the roam was playing PTH vs inf.  The real counter to inf grabs was Dstack + turrets, because then you had enough of a defensive cushion that running one guy in PTH chase all the time wasn't crippling."
Tribes,2rxdlx,WorkingAsIntended,3,Sat Jan 10 10:11:33 2015 UTC,"Jug hof was born out of necessity vs inf/o grabs, mortars and discs chew up the exit, at least it's what I have used that performed the best."
Tribes,2rxdlx,Xanthyr,2,Sun Jan 11 08:55:44 2015 UTC,"It may perform well, but I'd maintain that assuming the inf isn't braindead you can just ski backwards and watch/dodge incoming mortars/concs.  That's what I always did that performed best!"
Tribes,2rxdlx,WorkingAsIntended,1 point,Sun Jan 11 09:06:43 2015 UTC,"That is fair, but assuming you're cloaking on entry, if you screw up your energy, you're dead! :D"
Tribes,2rxdlx,Xanthyr,4,Mon Jan 12 00:30:54 2015 UTC,"It was a huge issue,  At that time EU was already flexible enough to incorperate PF chase into the standard SLD roam.   The big issue was that you could deny that PF from killing/concing the inf. Either by the inf himself killing the PF or coordinating killing the PF with teammates.   Also, because inf circumvented the initial pre-grab disruption it allowed the inf's offense to focus on covering rather than disrupting. When this is done well it's very hard to counter."
Tribes,2rxdlx,Ephixx,1 point,Sat Jan 10 12:07:07 2015 UTC,"I mean the slides bo was doing on dx he got it midfield like 4 times, which resulted in a couple caps.  With organization say some paths waiting to receive punts you wouldn't even need to run cappers.  And this game was its early stages before it could have been perfected with lightweight punting.  You can easily inf grab punt it to your field on maps like dx, arx, drydock, sunstar, before the defense can react.  Not to mention runnign say 2 inf offence one grabs, one kills the sniper, the only person who can stop the cluster quickly, and two paths waiting mid for punt."
Tribes,2rxdlx,pard0n99,1 point,Sat Jan 10 06:33:19 2015 UTC,"any slides on dx will make it midfield. if you don't run offense, hof can run raider jammer and even with stealthy there is a lot of time to react.  i just feel like there are ways to play around all playstyles with what hirez gave us. i did think that proxy soldier capping and broken mine locations (specifically those that could not be destroyed by splash damage) were inherently broken, but i've always been one who advocates for banning as little as possible."
Tribes,2rxdlx,qhp,5,Sat Jan 10 06:44:27 2015 UTC,"Alot of that has been tried and in the end it didn't work.  What works best was what JP mentioned that teams would straightout put more players on defense. (Usually having 1 dedicated PF/chase, which 3d doesn't allow in EU)   Or by just communicating really well. Inf's can get spotted pre-grab and their initial route says alot about their intentions. When an inf wasn't spotted yet by the D at all and an attack was going on it could be presumed an inf was going to try and grab. This how we countered it in [v]."
Tribes,2rxdlx,Ephixx,1 point,Sat Jan 10 12:19:43 2015 UTC,"So you wanted to play 7 snipe vs 7 smoke grenade inf?  Raider jammer on stand could only watch one direction at a time, With only plasma gun for a ground pound, I doubt you would have enough time to react or do much."

I'd use 0% for compatibility with rocket launcher in quake :) Most players would stay with default values,  chasers would use 100%... everyone would be happy."
Tribes,2rs5m1,mi_fly,0,Fri Jan 9 17:59:30 2015 UTC,No no no. This thing has to be uniform for comp play.
Tribes,2rs5m1,rgzdev,2,Fri Jan 9 20:09:58 2015 UTC,Why?
Tribes,2rs5m1,Schreq,1 point,Fri Jan 9 21:24:01 2015 UTC,"Comp play, and good PvP in general is based about navigating a maze of interaction between a multitude of elements. Largely, the intention is to remove chance and luck from the game as much as possible so that mastery is possible.  A good example is how random critical hits are removed from Team Fortress for competitive play.  Now you can't remove randomness completely from any game, if a soldier comes at you, you don't know if he is using an spare spinfusor or an Assault Rifle, but once you know because, let's say you gt hit once, or you have seen this player shot before, then you know what weapon he is using, and can plan your movement based on your expertise about the weapon.  Basically it's a reward for having painstakingly memorized weapon behavior.  Allowing anyone to tweak weapon stats means that the result of encounters is less reliant on player skill and more reliant on the ensuing randomness of encounters."
Tribes,2rs5m1,rgzdev,2,Sat Jan 10 04:16:49 2015 UTC,"Ok, that's pretty much the answer I expected and it lacks a good T:A/tribes based example of why it would generate ""randomness"".  In some early version of T:A, we had different disk speeds for most of the weapons and it totally didn't affect you on the receiving end. Was just annoying using the weapons because you had to learn multiple projectile speeds. We also have the blinks fusor and I'm pretty sure you wont be able to tell if somebody is using it in a duel. The only time you maybe would be at a disadvantage, because you can't know your opponents inheritance, is when somebody would be using 100% inheritance and is moving really fast, flying straight towards you. That's when the much faster disk speed might catch you off-guard because you jet up too late to dodge the ground pound. It's no big deal tho and the advantages of making inheritance a user variable far outweights the minor disadvantages."
Tribes,2rs5m1,Schreq,0,Sat Jan 10 13:46:20 2015 UTC,So i just wasted a lot of words on this. I should have gone through my gut feeling.  Also there are no advantages to making inheritance a configurable variable.
Tribes,2rs5m1,rgzdev,4,Sat Jan 10 15:09:27 2015 UTC,"Also there are no advantages to making inheritance a configurable variable.   That's like saying there are no advantages to making mouse sensitivity a configurable variable. Also with user configurable sensitivity, it gives you that randomness because you don't know if your opponent has very low sensitivity (ignoring dpi etc). So, trying to force your opponent to do a 180° turn, by thrusting past him for example, might not work out and potentially puts yourself in a bad spot when he doesn't have the very low sensitivity you predicted. It's a silly example, but in my opinion different inheritance values would only have effects to that degree.  It's just to give players the option to play with what they prefer and what's most intuitive for them. If that's no advantage then I don't know..."
Tribes,2rs5m1,Schreq,1 point,Sat Jan 10 15:29:00 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't bother with responding to rgzdev. He's proven in multiple games that he knows absolutely nothing about what he's talking about, and yet continues to try to start arguments on what he thinks competitive play is."

Tribes,2rs5m1,Schreq,2,Sun Jan 11 02:32:59 2015 UTC,Agreed. Their argument against 100% inheritance after examining Blinksfusor stats was just brain numbing.

Tribes,2rs5m1,concussedYmir,2,Fri Jan 9 12:12:18 2015 UTC,"Something along the lines of:   We have examined user play-time statistics and determined that less than 1% of players use the Blinksfusor. Clearly the community doesn't appreciate 100% inheritance weapons, therefore we will make no more."
Tribes,2rs5m1,qhp,1 point,Fri Jan 9 13:35:21 2015 UTC,"Well, let's be realistic. It's not like they would've made any more weapons anyway"
Tribes,2rs5m1,concussedYmir,1 point,Fri Jan 9 13:37:22 2015 UTC,The brain numbing part is that people didn't use the blink fusor because it messes up your aim when you go back to Soldier/Infiltrator/Jug/Brute.  If they simply changed all fusors to have 100% inheritance it wouldn't have been a problem.

Tribes,2rqt6p,Schreq,17,Thu Jan 8 16:09:16 2015 UTC,"It comes from idiots thinking fights in T:A are all about skiing, jetting, airtime and mid airs. It's like if people in quake would constantly complain about getting 100% accuracy shafted after using jumppads every time. They usually say chain is lame because it's too easy. Ofc it's easy if the guy saying that is hovering in the air like a retard while trying to ground pound you.  Just ignoring them and chaining them even harder is always the best solution."
Tribes,2rqt6p,Nark51,3,Thu Jan 8 16:26:21 2015 UTC,"Well said. The best is when the honorfusor shitters give you a full-on groundpound stare (that is, staring at the ground below you and waiting for you to land before firing 2 discs with their double groundpound quickdraw loadout, for those of you who aren't in the know) and don't even try for midairs, but still have the gall to tell you that you're dishonorable and have no skill for chaining his floating ass out of the sky.  These sorts of people have said so many times that chainguns never existed in older Tribes games that they actually think it's true, despite never even playing them. It spreads like some sort of sad propaganda from honorfusor to honorfusor until it hits upon impressionable shitters with default 30 mouse sensitivity and a 2400 dpi mouse who can only groundpound and think that what they say is the truth."
Tribes,2rqt6p,Schreq,4,Fri Jan 9 00:31:16 2015 UTC,"Hehe yes, those are the best. The people complaining usually don't understand how to fight. There are some good double disk players who can give you a run for your money in an infight."
Tribes,2rqt6p,Nark51,2,Fri Jan 9 00:52:37 2015 UTC,"And more often than not, those ones tend to complain about chain the least. The ones who bawl their eyes out at chain and start to hackuse are just pathetic and downright bad at the game.   I've found that dropping truthbombs about how chainguns have existed in every Tribes game sometimes shuts them up and makes them feel embarrassed for believing honorfusor propaganda."
Tribes,2rqt6p,Dodgesabre,4,Fri Jan 9 01:04:50 2015 UTC,Chaining is straight up boring to me 90% of the time. If people want to duel I'll duel but considering the amount of pugs I've played I'm really over it when it comes to pubs. Shitting on some 300 ping rank 20 who wants to double disc isn't that entertaining to me. We have people that only do MA only here and that's pretty much what I do unless they pound/chain me when I'm shocklance/disc chasing.   Hitting 3 chain shots on me after tripple nitroning with LW chasing some  380 sanic capper isn't exactly impressive. I just enjoy clutch situations and discing limits me so those occur way more often.

Tribes,2rqt6p,Nark51,5,Thu Jan 8 22:49:55 2015 UTC,"Shitters in pubs that get mad when you hit enough chain to kill them from full while you're chasing them at 300kmh are funny. They seem to think they're entitled for you to go for I Am King style midairs and if you don't they start crying and K-ing out whenever you get a bead on them as if you don't deserve it.  Truth is is that there is not a whole lot of people who do bother with that, and the people that do only make those hits like <1% of the time and end up with cowboy capped-out pubs turning over on to Blue Shift which empties the server. Actual Lightweight/Rage chasing versus fast cappers is probably the only thing in pubs which is remotely fun at this point for me (the rest of it is either helping a d-stack hard at base or going up against fifty turrets at the enemy base yourself), and it certainly does take more skill than groundpound floating up and down.  The plural of axis is axes by the way."

Tribes,2rpqi2,Shaeress,1 point,Thu Jan 8 15:01:36 2015 UTC,"Well, back in early beta the idea that explosives should get more room and use in T;A was more prevalent.

I think that opinion faded the more people realised just how much would have to change for that to be the case and the more we all realised more and more that HiRez wouldn't make any difficult changes ever."
Tribes,2rpqi2,Ephixx,5,Thu Jan 8 15:09:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say most people started chaining due to their lack of faith in Hirez. It would moreso be due to them becoming more experienced, influenced (by more veteran players) and thus educated.  I know you started out refusing to chain, so maybe that's why you and other likeminded people looked at the game like that. But I doubt that was as much as a majority as you mentioned."
Tribes,2rpqi2,Shaeress,1 point,Thu Jan 8 15:40:17 2015 UTC,"Oh, what people thought and what people did are different things. People use chains because they're powerful and in the game and not completely bullshit (most skilled players seem to avoid the total bullshit things... like smoke nades).  I more think that the discussions and the thoughts changed direction as people learned more and as we realised that HiRez wouldn't implement any huge changes. No reason to have lengthy discussions about how to implement thrust vectoring after we realise that there was no way in hell it would ever even be tested. Also, since then we've had more discussions on how autos actually work and why, and the changes proposed have grown ever smaller. Now the common consensus among experienced comp players seem to be that autos are pretty fine the way they are.  And my using explosives came more from me entering comp by being the biggest pubstar ever known, using the HBL because I found it fun and then stubbornly holding onto it to prove people wrong when they said it'd be impossible to be a good comp HoF using it instead of the chain gun... that the chain gun is probably the most boring weapon in the entire game also helps."

So 95%+ of all my ""Most Awesome memories"" (such as the 3 times I Grabbed with us down in OT as it returned, and we ended up tying and then winning, twice with me having the tying and winning cap) I don't have recorded.

Tribes,2rjogf,GrethSC,3,Wed Jan 7 13:50:49 2015 UTC,I had him on the Shazpod podcast ... Start of closed beta. He didn't hate it back then. He was still positive in the way that he still thought hirez could fix their mistakes. So technically positive.
Tribes,2rjogf,indiecore,2,Wed Jan 7 10:25:50 2015 UTC,"PROJ probably made some of the best criticisms and suggestions for fixes out of anyone, HiRez just pissed him off so bad he decided the best thing to do was just burn the whole thing down."
Tribes,2rjogf,Smarag,8,Sun Jan 11 17:53:29 2015 UTC,"This community. I told you motherfuckers from the very first day the kind of ""either grind or pay to win"" monetization would only ever be chosen by devs that don't care about their game, because it inherently only encourages to make the game as unfun as possible to anybody who doesn't pay while making those who pay, pay more and more with every patch. There isn't a single game in existance with developers who actually care that use an evil monetization system like that."
Tribes,2rjogf,GrethSC,3,Tue Jan 6 23:21:22 2015 UTC,"To that I say: No shit. We all knew. But we had to try. And at the start, it really looked like things were heading in the right direction. That's why we were so fucking pissed. Because we gave them the benefit of the doubt.   And I'll admit that at times I was completely fooled. It was an abusive relationship with a manic depressive. One day everything looked like it would be okay, then next day you're in the basement, bruised and battered, crying in a pool of your own refuse. Through the heaving sobs you could hear the door open. Heavy footfalls down the stairs.  Pulling free the caked blood from your eyelids you shudder and whince, you still look into his eyes. But the fear ebbs away, there is a smile this time.   ""We're going to give community physics a try!""  Is that all we ever wanted? I don't know anymore. But there is hope again. Maybe this will be the start of a better time?  And so we allow him to drag us up the stairs, a firm grip on our hair.   You'll see, it'll be better this time."
Tribes,2rjogf,prettzl,2,Wed Jan 7 16:00:30 2015 UTC,Are you really so delusional to think that Hi-Rez pandering to the community instead of actively working on making the game BETTER was remotely good for this game?  Are you truly that fucking thick?
Tribes,2rjogf,GrethSC,3,Thu Jan 8 09:02:23 2015 UTC,"Oh dear sweetness. Are you so delusional to think that there was a singular voice that united this community? Do you think that the unfiltered voice of Tribal War and the all individual voices of different competitive roles was one brimming chorus?  It was a cacaphony of feedback. But sometimes the cackle and sneering did produce a single sentence that they stood behind.  Through the humming and buzzing a common ground was still present. The hive was unified on the large scope. And plenty of attempts were made to communicate just that. And oddly enough, all of that was deemed as accepted. Yet nothing came of it.  Hirez didn't know, didn't want to know. The solutions were presented. They were nobody's individual whim. Both hardcore grizzled veteran and lowly newbie agreed on several things. And none of those were fixed.  It is you that lives in the delusion. A bitter simplistic view of recent history. A flawed representation of what really happened."
Tribes,2rjogf,prettzl,-2,Thu Jan 8 10:07:06 2015 UTC,"You lost all reasonability at ""competitive"".  This game was never going to be tailored to be competitive. (Just like SMITE isn't ever going to be tailored to be.)  Hi-Rez is a casual game company. This community has been absolutely insane to believe otherwise.  The difference between FPS comp and MOBA comp is that the ""top tier"" players of MOBA comp don't give a shit if the game is balanced, so long as they win. That goes along with Hi-Rez's overall development goals and business plan than the FPS market will ever do."
Tribes,2rjogf,GrethSC,2,Thu Jan 8 21:49:10 2015 UTC,"With very little extra effort this game would have been perfectly comp viable. It didn't need to be a main goal. One does not exclude the other. Look at CS:GO right now, both competitive and casual, so you're 'FPS' market mention is doing quite well.. Even MOBAs are competitive - flawed games as they might be.   T:A would have never been the second coming that many asked it to be. But it would have been a good competitive shooter that would have been miles above most games out there right now. Tribe's nature even allows for quite some flaws in balance as most of the skill is team / coordination based.  And the word you were looking for was 'credibility'.  You bore me now. Good day."
Tribes,2rjogf,prettzl,-1,Thu Jan 8 22:55:26 2015 UTC,"adjective 1. agreeable to reason or sound judgment; logical: a reasonable choice for chairman. 2. not exceeding the limit prescribed by reason; not excessive: reasonable terms. 3. moderate, especially in price; not expensive: The coat was reasonable but not cheap. 4. endowed with reason. 5. capable of rational behavior, decision, etc.  Nah I think I know what I meant.  You're being irrational, and on top of that you've never displayed credibility to begin with.  I do apologize for boring you, sir, I'll do better next time.  Unless you don't want pandering anymore, then I'll continue to argue intelligently while you become bored.  Thanks for bringing up CS- specifically Global Offensive, a game that actually is torn at the competitive level.  Players of CS:GO competitive are as ""casual"" as MOBA comp players due to the hard limit of skill that comes from CS 1.6 players compared to CS:S and GO players. The games are much easier and accessible. There is no denying this."
Tribes,2rjogf,GrethSC,1 point,Fri Jan 9 01:18:03 2015 UTC,"Forgive me for toying around with my replies. It's just that I've had this conversation a lot, and you're clearly just out here to rage.  I agree completely that those games are simple. I'm still in the dev team of a high skill ceiling FPS, I know how shallow and deprived the current generation is. But that's because the base design of the game is limited to begin with. CS will always be just a possitional shooter - with game knowledge added under the guise of mechanical skill - spray patterns etc... The same for DOTA - Game knowledge trumping mechanical skill every time.  Tribes has a very high skill ceiling. It has a very high potential even in the base form presented in T:A. That's why it would have taken a very small amount of effort to make it work for high end competition. Even if the goal was casual. Which is asinine considering the history of the IP (Note that I know Tribes never made it big in the proto-esport days, but considering skill and ceilings etc.. It easily is up there with Brood War and Quake. It never got as big though)."
Tribes,2rjogf,prettzl,0,Fri Jan 9 16:00:33 2015 UTC,"You must not deal with ragers very often. They leave when they're done.  I've been here for 2, going on 3, years now saying the exact same things because no one here is either intelligent enough to notice, willfully ignores the truth or doesn't give a shit about this community or the games enough to say what is actually wrong.  Also you should know, from being a game dev, that the skill ceiling of a game does not present itself until there are high level players and low level players of a completed game. Tribes: Ascend has only 2 classes of beta testing players and that's casuals and tryhards, neither are good or bad. The tryhards complain about balance. The casuals call the tryhards hackers. The skill ceiling is more of a skill cliff, you suddenly go from playing like a casual to landing shots. That's Tribes: Ascend in a nutshell."

If you keep playing, you will get better. No easy way around it.   I, like loads of others started in the gen room as well and from there I moved to capping (if you could call it that). Later came other offensive and defensive roles. Still there are roles I really haven't explored. For example I can't drive the tank and gravbike at all, shrike barely."

Tribes,2ri3np,player111,1 point,Tue Jan 6 18:54:25 2015 UTC,"But I really enjoy defending my base/attacking enemy base. :( Whenever I go for capping I get shutdown immediately even if I grab on high speed and even if I do manage to get back to base, the flag is never there. There are these pro snipers who never miss a single shot haha."
Tribes,2ri3np,ZombieSlayer543,4,Tue Jan 6 10:29:18 2015 UTC,"Learn fast routes and just do them during the match, you'll eventually get the flag at least once. What I do is I usually start a route when one of my team mates already has the flag, especially if theyre med or heavy classes. In a pub, I know those were either llamas or slow grabs which will probably get shut down, allowing me to hit the stand a couple seconds after the enemy team returns their flag. Knowing who has the flag in pubs can help you know when or when not to start a route. As for having fun defending the base, let me tell you that you'll have much more fun either chasing or keeping people off the flag. Capping can be challenging, but since the flag is practically off the stand for 60-70% of the time, you'll always have a job chasing. So start playing the flag and when you find yourself getting shutdown too often while capping, switch to chasing, or help your team in some way ie) provide offense (but not in Gen, unless you really need to for turrets and such.), protect the flag on stand, etc. Doing this stuff will also really improve your aim (especially chasing) and will make you an overall better player than any of the gen room junkies."

Tribes,2rilps,senitelfriend,3,Tue Jan 6 15:34:21 2015 UTC,"Oh Hey... I found this. I think I wrote it when my internet was down.   Tank Commanding   Basics  Driving:      - Drive forward when moving to a firing position.     - Don't stop moving. Youre the single easier target to spot in the game. Someone is always trying to hit you with a strike.     - Forward is 80~sanics you can parallel someone who's cratered or on flat ground.     - Drive like 'mater the rest of the time. For 2 reasons     - 1) Turning is significantly faster backwards   2) When you switch seats you always point towards the front of your tank. Allowing you to get off 180 shots before your turret has swiveled more than 90 degrees.  Firing:      - Inheritence is king, but easy to note considering how binary the top speed of 80 (100 boost) is.     - Largest splash radius in the game. Lead your target or you will boost them.      - Take the shot. But prioratize close>long range. Don't waste your huge reload time on a low %, when   high % are in front of you.  Bombardment  Positioning:      -Use hills that offer saber cover.     -Have multiple bombardment positions     -Should still be on D, in sight of flagstand and/or O-crash routes (not all maps good for this b/c of it) Firing:     -Remember the exact angle/location your shooting from.       -Inheritence makes a HUGE impact at 200+meters.      -Anyone who stops to fight you after your first shot, Is another meatbag away from your flagstand, or   off theirs.  The Shot ""Oops You dead now""  -Positioning:     -Always keep a bowl/valley within 45 degrees of your cannon when not actively targeting.     -Keep areas of interest in sight, even when not engaging targets     -Do not sit in high traffic areas. That's what you're denying     -Unless specifically pulling attention off your stand, you don't want to be the first thing Offense sees.  -Firing     -Lead     -Turret aim is similar to shrike movement, calm down and visualize.      -Do J turns, as they pass you for max turret swivel.     -Pot shots at jugs: to help your HOF     -Pot shots at Brutes/raiders: To start fights OUTSIDE your gen.     -Pot shots at Paths: Most of your kills. Cappers are low% shots compared to LD. In standoffs, beo ENDS Nitroners.     -Pot shots at Infs: 2nd Most kills. Keep your eagle eye on defense for when they unstealth. they don't move as fast as paths    or fly as high as soldiers     -Pot shots at soldiers: If they aren't running double explosive, any amount of splash will ruin their offensive run   The Duel                You are guaranteed a fight after killing one of them.  Positioning:     -The ideal hill is like the one you find all over crossfire. Small, steep, and with little cover around it.     -use skateboard physics to turn.     -Deny them the high ground, or run across to the next valley+hill (backwards)     -Save your energy for spinfusers. people are like turrets. once the shots comitted, you can avoid it.     -Drive like mater.     -Run them over if they want to get close. At best, tire treads. At worst eject. Most times They'll suicide on the outside of your tank with their specialty tank-killing explosive     -Run away from double explosive soldiers. 50+M and you can dodge spinfusers with reverse boost turns.         and force them into open ground with low energy.  Firing:     -Don't waste your cooldown.(Dont go too long without bombarding, and be ready for incoming O/cap)     -Better to hit yourself for 2k with a splash than let the enemy go unharmed.     -hit em before they land, and especially as they take off. HUGE SPLASH     -Always aim for the finisher. If you were fighting a Brute, and an inf joins the fun, retarget the inf. (don't forget the brutes regen)     -Death eminent? Keep in mind who you hit last. You need to peg them again before regen."

Tribes,2rilps,wordthompsonian,2,Wed Jan 7 03:34:52 2015 UTC,"Turn the pitch and yaw sensitivity to 100 on each, the default turning time is way too slow. I guess the first thing you want to do is practice not crashing into everything. The Free shrikes/Free Shrikes II/XIV (or whatever it is) server in NA is a good place to practice basic shriking."
Tribes,2rilps,Theheartattack,3,Tue Jan 6 14:41:04 2015 UTC,"Yaw and pitch settings depend on DPI. I use a really low DPI so I have mine at 100 but if someone has stupid high DPI then they might not need to  Also, I'd say if you're just learning to shrike go on roam map and pick Sunstar. Try to fly through all the tops of towers that have little openings/holes near the top of them. Try to make little routes and mix it up for fun, do this until you can get it down really well and try to do sharper turns into them, etc. when you start getting better"

Tribes,2rilps,wordthompsonian,2,Tue Jan 6 19:11:45 2015 UTC,"I have a few main concerns for people trying to learn from the pubber's video:  -he makes it seem like doing a random 360 degree spin when you're already facing your opponent is a good idea. You're stationary when you do so and you'll just get disked, even if your momentum makes you move a bit when you do this, you aren't facing your opponent for the majority of the time and do not know if they are shooting an explosive at you and if they are, where it is going so you can avoid it  -when he goes for roadkills he flies directly at people in a straight line, or curving in a predictable pattern if they change directions. Most decent and even fairly inexperienced players will just shoot a disk where you're going to go if you make it so obvious  -he also sometimes spends the time to shoot plasma shots while completely letting go of the controls and just floating near his opponent. You usually want to use these when you're far away and moving toward the opponent, then swerving to the side before there explosives can reach you from so far away  I've watched most of it before and it's very well edited and really entertaining, but it's not great for building good shrike habits.  This example of Shad is good because it's fairly long so you can see what he does in a variety of situations. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghc0NC8hhrE You can visit his channel and scroll down a bit to see his other shriking videos if you want to see more of it.  You'll notice a couple important things here:  -when he's moving toward someone that is facing him with an explosive weapon, he either makes it difficult to predict by appearing to fly straight beside them and miss, but swerves last second or does zigzags as he approaches  -he also sometimes completely bails on the hit if they are facing him with an explosive weapon before they have a chance to shoot at him so there is no risk. It is a really important skill to have as a shriker, knowing when to bail and being confident in your decision. Shriking isn't about bashing into everything that moves, but when you do go for a hit you have to be confident and make it count, because if you miss you're just risking getting hit for nothing  Aside from those two main points, you see him sometimes take a saber shot because it's more efficient to chase people then spend the time waiting behind a hill. If you're practicing for competitive or something, you want to dodge every saber to get into the habit, but if you're messing around in free shrikes you can just sack your shrike and just get a new one anyways  I thought I'd write this little bit up on shriking because I remember 2-3 years ago trying to find shriking guides when I was starting to learn it and there just weren't any with useful information beyond saying simple controls and to practice them, so I had to watch what I could and learn for myself. Before I stopped shriking in comp I considered myself pretty effective at shriking and one of the top couple considering not many people shriked in comp. Remember that there is no point in buying a shrike if you're trying to win if you're not going to be more effective than if you're out of it, although games are made to have fun so even if you aren't going to be more effective then go for it anyway and have a good time if you like shriking  Other than all of this, just practice basic movement and running into people, these two things just take time to develop and once you have them down you'll notice applying these tips will help a lot in your success"
Tribes,2rilps,CallShenanigans,2,Tue Jan 6 20:24:02 2015 UTC,"i saw my name randomly  basically, aside from the points you made, imo shriking is about positional awareness and reflexes  you have to see a battlefield, be able to turn around couple of times and still  know where your targets are, having accounted for their traveling time and direction, without looking. tbh thats what i liked about it (more so in t2, the shrike in ta is garbage). its not seeing that determines whether youre good, its not seeing but still knowing  then, you need reflexes to make adjustments. dodging, hitting, whatever it is that comes up suddenly  chaining together the targets in your head while adjusting for random factors was what i liked  then theres control. knowing where the hitboxes are, and how to clip people just barely with your wings. that was fun with the old, fucked up controls  also, fuck the aoe blaster bullshit"

Try not going full speed forward and save your thrust.  If you just hold the back button the shrike will actually lift straight up like a helicopter so you can spin around while maintaining altitude, basically turning on a dime.  I also like to set my in game vehicle sensitivity to 100 and increase my dpi with a toggle when I shrike. edit: the right click thrust button while not pressing any other buttons allows you to hover in place."

Like everything in this game you have to give it time and practice and you will be rewarded.  Maneuverability can be frustrating and lack of regen is a real disadvantage but with time these challenges get worked through and the vehicles become pretty powerful with a practiced pilot. Give it time...it's so worth it!  I avoided them until I wanted to get the roadkill badge. Now, long after that achievement, there is nothing like a tank MA or hail mary hit across the map.

Started out in 2004, was in a couple of CTF teams and some arena teams. Stopped playing about a year before T:A came out. Played on american arena server at the end. Ping was horrible but I got good after a while. Or better, at least :)"

Tribes,2r0j0p,Ephixx,5,Sat Jan 3 00:35:03 2015 UTC,"The rules Etheral mentioned aren't attempts to set himself up for an optimal game, these were the rules EU used on the ladder(s) and for tournaments in the past.   With that said, I don't think anyone would beat Etheral fairly. I've gotten close-ish~~ but my forte is CG duels. (Which is a completely different game)   What I'm hoping for is that either some confident t2 vet will be up for the challenge or some TA honorplayer will be stepping up to try his luck in a game which isn't completely retarded without cg."
Tribes,2r0j0p,ShilaSing,3,Sat Jan 3 21:26:58 2015 UTC,Maybe I'll come out of retirement to win the $200.  I was on the TWL base ladder for months w/undefeated record against people who used CG.  I'm well beyond my prime but perhaps I can Rocky-style train to get back into fighting shape.  Proceeds go to Archetype/Project Z dev budget.
Tribes,2r0j0p,boldfilter,2,Mon Jan 5 20:41:44 2015 UTC,"But for this $200 it's on EU of course. However, if you'd like a $100 counter-bet situation we can do 50% on NA and 50% on EU and then whoever wins on average wins. First to 15 on both regions. Pretty damn fair imo. If I'm just handing out $200 with no prospect of possible return I'm doing it on my turf."

Tribes,2r0j0p,socium,2,Sat Jan 3 22:31:47 2015 UTC,Just play singleplayer if you don't wanna wait for opponents. Normally I just enter a soundless room on the map and alt+tab and go play another game or browse/listen to music while I wait. You can still hear it when poeple say VGH or you get a challenge.

Tribes,2qrq0c,bagofwiggins,5,Tue Dec 30 02:11:09 2014 UTC,I would make one in a heartbeat if I had the model file.  That fucker would be painted and glazed in a week.

I've got the psk here straight out of the game, and I also got rid of the pose/rigging bits and exported it as an stl here.   However, 1. I have no idea what I'm doing so it could be completely unusable for printing and 2. It's not solid, so you'll have to figure out how to attach the floating bits anyway.  Maybe it's useful"
Tribes,2qrq0c,Ambiguous_comment,1 point,Tue Dec 30 17:04:38 2014 UTC,I was thinking more like what SLD loads in to theirs and what's spinning in the Devastator Fuzor.  Something I could put a few LEDs in to change the color of it.

Tribes,2qp33g,duhlitz,-2,Mon Dec 29 21:45:50 2014 UTC,It is considerably worse. Anyone who truly loved this game or the true spirit of tribes is long gone. Now it's a pickup community ran by hackers and aspergs who weren't good enough to be recognized when it mattered. So now pugs are this weird try hard but not too hard ego fest. Its almost impossible to have fun anymore. Leave while you can.
Tribes,2qp33g,pard0n99,11,Mon Dec 29 17:27:50 2014 UTC,"Why you haf be mad?  why you starting drama buhlitz insulting people.  Why can't you just be with content with pugs and the nerds who play them.  I remember when I first started pugging and it was the biggest most uninviting ego fest you could step into.  I had respected community members rage quit pugs because they didn't want to play with newer players.  There were always ""high level"" pugs that would exclude the newer players, and then other people would leave cuz they didn't get picked for a high level and the noobs didn't get to play at all.  I would say it is much less of an ego-fest now than it used to be.    As far as hackers, there is one guy.  His name is sekae and he cheats in pubs sometimes when he is bored.  He cheated in one pug and we didn't let him play all of EUTL, I think he paid for his deeds.  And when he did cheat in a pug he tried not to use the energy hacks that he was too lazy to turn off.  The other cheater was tribesballer and he doesn't pug anymore.  How many cheaters played tribes back in your glory days of tribes??  Probably a lot more,  I think Hotwire was known for energy hacking among others,  Acef@lcon was a respected aimbotting sniper.  And who knows how many pro's cheated and made it under the radar.  It's not like hirez anti-cheat was any good, and there were always built in shineyboots/boxes, just less people knew about them.    As far as not being recognized, It was more a matter of who you knew than how good you were.  And from what I saw everyone was pretty bad back then except snipers and a few players who could chain like Titan/mstarr.  I remember Coffeerage could chain with the best of them and streamed and still was stuck on a low tier team.  But I guess you don't measure skill in how well you can kill but I believe killing power is very important. Anyway, you baited well with this comment I couldn't help myself,  Are you still running looter on every class? =)"
Tribes,2qp33g,Obyeag,2,Mon Dec 29 18:42:53 2014 UTC,Sekae still toggleboxes in pubs sigh
Tribes,2qp33g,freefoodd,8,Mon Dec 29 21:20:06 2014 UTC,"Yea true there were a lot more good players back then and without a doubt superior teams. I still have as much fun pugging and pubbing as I ever did, though obviously they are weak compared to 1.5 years just because of the lack of position players (cap/snipe) and motivation. Regarding individual player skill, angrypolak or frell playing offense would be an improvement to any team in tribes history (NA).  As for rose tinted glssses, blitz, I think you've got the thickest pair."
Tribes,2qp33g,duhlitz,-6,Mon Dec 29 18:52:52 2014 UTC,"Regarding individual player skill, angrypolak or frell playing offense would be an improvement to any team in tribes history (NA).   And this is why you are dumb. They both had their chance, and weren't good enough when it mattered."
Tribes,2qp33g,freefoodd,4,Mon Dec 29 20:27:24 2014 UTC,"In my original reply to this guy's question I meant two things: there isn't anything in the game now that makes it worse than it was 1.5 years ago and I'm still having fun playing it.  Ascend in the 7v7 format is a team game. There just aren't any teams left; no competition. No one to practice with; no one to compete with. Individual skill has been and will always be there. The mechanics, decision making, awareness, communication, and play-making abilities of angrypolak and frell are as good as >95% of the competitive players I've played with/against and spectated. How good they and their teams were 1.5 years ago is irrelevant.   Pick up games have never been the same as scrims or matches. You're not playing and improving with the same guys everyday. With the decrease in player base things have changed. In the effort to get fourteen, you are going to end up with a wide spread in the levels of try hard mstarr mojo in each player, with more on the lower end of the spectrum. This is again compounded by the fact that there is no competition, no bigger point. Despite this, or maybe because of it, we compete where we can in PUGs, because we still have that sense of competition and the desire to play better. When you play in EU you can see the difference night and day; they have more players and therefore more people who take things a little bit more seriously. That's why kOut played in EUTL S5.   I guess you're right then, at least on a certain level. In the competitive aspect the game isn't the same one we played 1.5 years ago. In order to have fun we have to take what we can get. For some it's playing with friends; others can try to get that esports fix they need, and for some reason there are still people who are trying to make montages so that practically dozens of people will think I am p good at game."

Tribes,2qp33g,Ephixx,8,Tue Dec 30 00:31:01 2014 UTC,"True.  I don't get how some players can claim that the top players in '12 were alot better than the current players.   The first year of comp was filled with top players who had a specific skill which they excelled at, but weren't well rounded at all. There were tons of top players with ('12 standards) great mechanics but horrible awareness, communication, teamplay, etc for today's standards. Yet they still won tournaments, because back then you didn't need to be well rounded at all to make things happen.   This is simply logical because back then people were more busy trying to innovate and set the meta, rather than perfecting their play in a competitive meta that didn't even exist yet."

Tribes,2qp33g,duhlitz,-2,Tue Dec 30 01:25:53 2014 UTC,So what you are trying to tell me is that players who kept playing got better? No shit You dense fucking shit bags. If the players who were better than you then kept playing they would STILL be better.  This same argument happens at the death of every tribes comp. I was there when you were not. I was one of those players that were shit early on and got better. I witnessed the growth of all of the greats then and now. You are all ducking dumb it's seriously painful to read. There is a reason the same group of 20 players won pretty much every cash tournament the game had. For ducks sake guys wake the fuck up and be realistic.

Maybe you feel since tribes is dead pugging becomes pointless when before there were teams, and tournaments, and upcomming players, things were exciting and pugging was serious practice.  Pugging had a higher importance meaning and goal than it does now.  Now all it is is to have some fun and get your Tribes itch scratched.  Then you can go back to w/e other game you want to play.

Tribes,2qp33g,Shadowfax7337,3,Mon Dec 29 16:31:20 2014 UTC,"Honestly, if you get on NA servers, it's really not dead at all.  We get at least 5 full servers a day, a couple pugs, and servers rotate fine, no ping spikes, and without crashes on Central servers, which are basically the only servers...  It's not as dead as everyone says that it is."

Tribes,2qp33g,Urtiza,2,Mon Dec 29 08:51:08 2014 UTC,"Tribes is not dead, those who truly love the game(like myself) keep playing it despite all of the talk. The reason for no more updates is because the game is already in a great place, changing it further would risk killing it. Hirez will be developing a way to make it possible for people to create their own maps. Which is really the next step. We should be thankful that Hirez has respect for the game and is trying to keep the core principles alive. Yes they are focused on smite as of now but who can blame them they are micro managers. Who am i to complain about a free to play game. If anyone is killing tribes its the ones who no longer play it.  Falling out because of no more updates is pathetic. Ive been playing since 2012, and will keep playing as long as the servers are up."

Tribes,2qp33g,xFREAKAZOIDx,2,Tue Dec 30 19:07:07 2014 UTC,"Tribes is falling apart at the seams.  All resources focused on smite.  Servers are worse than ever.  So, yea, you could call it a dying game."

Joined some random server and started running toward Berezhino.  I ran into a random group of players there and talked to them for a couple of minutes.  DayZ is kind of strange in that you can't see another player's name ever unless they use the in game text chat (we had been using voice prior to that).  I saw a chat message pop up from one of them and then looked at the name of the guy who said it... Altimor.  It blew my damn mind. The DayZ game world is HUGE and there are 1000s of servers to play on and I somehow found Altimor at like 4 PM on a weekday, all because he decided to use text chat.  Never would have known it was him otherwise."

Tribes,2qgj7u,AFireInAsa,3,Sat Dec 27 00:54:07 2014 UTC,"There's a lot more going on in this video than it looks. You have to play T1 and know the evolution of it to gain a real appreciation for what is happening in a demo like this.  The need for perfectly timed coordinated offensive plays sprung up in T:A because of their necessity to get the flag out. You won't see that in T1 mostly because they never were forced to play this way. As you can see, they could have benefited from it on a map like Stoneblind, but at this time, this game was like two kings clashing into each other like never before. [IE] was the greatest T1 team in the early days, just look at their record http://web.archive.org/web/20001017050047/www.imperial-elite.com/record.html  When [IE] retired, team 5150 took over as the top team. They remained the best Tribes team that ever lived through the early days T2 and T:V, being undefeated in those games.  Team [IE] came out of retirement for this tournament, and this occurrence was the two teams playing at close-to-peak level for probably the first time. 90% of the other teams the face were probably pubstomps due to the sheer skill of players. Team 5150's defense here was probably the best [IE] ever faced. They never needed to practice coordinated pushes, instead winning games from mechanical skill and superior individual tactics. Add this to the fact that getting out with a flag is much easier in T1 because of a multitude or reasons, like the fog of war. This map in particular, Snowblind, is an anomaly. There were something like 40 maps released with T1 and a bunch of others modded in afterwards. They played a lot more highly-varied maps than people do in T:A.  Instead, their coordination comes from a other places. There are no permanent flag icons in T1. If the flags move, you have to be in constant communication to find out where the hell these people are going with it.  Another way they are communicating is about inventory stations. You spawn in a weak loadout without an energy pack (pretty essential on this map) and your defense has to not only stop flags from getting out, but keep inventories up so the offense doesn't get slowed down too much. They have to keep  All this on top of the fact that these players didn't have the readily available VOIP services like we do today. Most of their communication (if not all) was done through the V chat menu. I actually believe one of the 5150 players, TheRedDread, wrote and sold VOIP software around this time. Can't imagine it being very high-quality.  Most of the innovations were tactical and made by a lot of the players you see here. A lot of the stuff you take for granted, like the ability to ski, wasn't always known to these players. Natural is very famous for his early route videos where he showed extreme proficiency to ski and ski fast in a time a lot of people didn't know skiing existed. If you pay close attention, you can see a lot of the tricky ways he approaches the flagstand which would not be very normal in pub play. In these times, this stuff was leagues above pub play."

Tribes,2qgj7u,AFireInAsa,1 point,Sun Dec 28 07:24:46 2014 UTC,you're wrong about the timing  timing is everything in t1  but unlike the later games where it all came down to simple things like  we must all band together to strike at one time perfectly (t:a tv t2 etc)  t1 had more of a meta factor where everything was chained together into connected waves that changed and were fractals (ya i know that sounds spergy and drugged up)  this is one of those things that you aren't going to pick up on unless you're a really higher level player. it takes a fucking book to explain it. and its why people like stork would say never chase as home d when there are situations you actually should chase because its just so complicated and situational to explain it takes forever and he just wanted people to learn the very basics.  explaining a game based on patterns that are fractal and take multiple rounds of spawning to develop is like explaining how to play chess at the very top level to people. at the end of the day most of the people that got these patterns just got them from playing a really long time and knowing probable outcomes of certain scenarios before they happened  if you want a brief look into what im talking about  read storks LT guide (which is like a basic primer in it but still super long and 90% of people still dont get it despite it being completely on point) http://www.tribalwar.com/forums/showthread.php?t=639266  and then read this thread which basically was the culmination of an argument we had about teaching people to play rigid and never chase as home d vs teaching them the truth that its much more efficient to chase sometimes (this is like the LT guide but it has a bunch of situational bs that will confuse the fuck out of most people)  http://www.tribalwar.com/forums/showthread.php?t=648878  this type of metagame is the simple reason why a lot of us never have been able to get into t2 tv t:a etc. those games take away the fractal meta game and end up having it be more like 1 coordinated attack. it looses the flow of the game that we love and it gets boring stale and unchallenging quick.  case in point is look what rtcll accomplished in ta and he would be considered a high tier player in t1 but not nearly the best at his position or overall in the game except i guess at tr  now imagine if there were teams of people that regularly schooled rtcll to the point of making him look terrible in matches
Tribes,2qgj7u,AFireInAsa,4,Sat Dec 27 18:23:10 2014 UTC,"Yea, I said T1 but I should have said T1 during this time. T:A took tighter timed coordinated attacks to get the flag out than T1 did at the time of this demo. This is not a positive towards T:A because it was too hard to get the flag out against a good defense which created stale games.  I've read the guide and I definitely agree that T1 is deeper and what I would call are tree diagrams of situations have been way more thought out and discovered in T1 than any other Tribes game. Timing is just as important in T1 as in T:A, it's just a different less spergy and straightforward kind of timing. In T:A it consisted of getting together with your team for practice and running OvD waves one a time until your O figured it out and could get out on your defense. Top player's abilities to read situations are way higher in T1."
Tribes,2qgj7u,FishStix1,-1,Sat Dec 27 19:25:42 2014 UTC,"that is a really good post and i agree 100%  ill throw something else out tho that is controversial 4 sake of conversation tho  because t2 never had an LT community that type of extreme situational reading never had an environment to develop in  this is why you'll consistently see people with a huge t1 background became top players in any new tribes franchise game that sticks to the core of skiing and flag play  it happened in t2, t:v, and t:a  but you don't see players very often going backwards even from t2 to t1 and then dominating  the game environment is just too unique and ends up fucking with people"
Tribes,2qgj7u,Symtex123,2,Sat Dec 27 22:58:30 2014 UTC,"i think mechanically and tactically t1 players are better than t2 players at tribes. t1 players use more disc and nades, chaingun levels are similar but t2 players might edge that out since i think they spam it more and in more situations.  also i think t2 players have a higher general fps skill level because of their hitscan aim due to the prevalence of the laser rifle (used a lot more than sniper in t1). most fpses feature some sort of hitscan aiming therefore they have a bigger chance of being good at it.8  if a new game came out that featured base gameplay, i think t2 players would actually fair better if it has any sort of emphasis on vehicles. they are still playing their pubs in base today. if it doesn't, i think their base strategies are stronger and could put them on even footing with t1 players whose disc/nades/fundamentals are better.  this is just my opinion on it, especially seeing how many top tier snipers t2 produced in t:a."

Slow down the video to around 1 FPS and you will see that the reaction to adada is faster than the FPS this video was recorded at. A person cannot adjust to changes in direction that quickly, even a professional athlete or someone on a lot of stimulants could not reduce their reaction time to the sub-100 ms range. They can do this for anticipation shots, but random adada cannot be easy anticipated. The aim correction on ImmortalShrek JUG on the hill does not make sense. Compare this to a legitimate player like Knutsson, who has amazing chain but clearly not perfect correct like this player has."
Tribes,2qgf8h,ticklemethere328,6,Fri Dec 26 18:44:14 2014 UTC,"This is obviously toggling, as the OP says. Nobody stops firing in the direction of a smoke inf the second he smokes (especially if he's left with low health and you're using an nj5 that does 125 damage a bullet), you keep going hoping that you can finish him off, this guy on the other hand turns off his cheat and his aim flicks around as soon as the guy smokes. The fact that he toggles off and lets the smoke inf live with a tiny amount of health twice makes this clear that he's trying to hide the fact that he's cheating. Anyone too blind to see this one simple fact in the video is simply an idiot, this is more obvious evidence than the aiming itself.  Hopefully APC will find the time to log on for 1 minute and issue a ban, like he's done in the past with videos of obvious proof of people cheating that I've sent him personally."

It does look like an aim bot when he starts shooting and tracking you through the hillside.  The last clip looks like normal chain though, and the clip with raider looks normal only takes a couple shots with raider to kill inf, you should lose that duel everytime.  The fact that he running survivalist and grabs a nug means hes prob not complete noob and prob a someone smurfing.  I would say only the first two clips are suspect.

Tribes,2qch5f,Kevintrinh1999,6,Thu Dec 25 06:28:34 2014 UTC,"1.)Find someone who is really good at dueling 2.)Practice improving accuracy with your chaingun and splash weapon. Learn when to use what weapon. 3.)Also practice trying not to get hit. 4.)Press F really good.    Seriously, there's not much beyond that. Dueling takes practice, lots of practice."
Tribes,2qch5f,Rynex,3,Thu Dec 25 11:09:17 2014 UTC,"Practice. Lots.  But do so smartly, i.e. focus on actually improving. If nade aim is your problem, you could for example fire up the bot practice map and try to instagib the bot running around on one of the xfire ships with nades from all kind of angles, while you're walking around, jetting sideways, or even while flying by at capping speed.  Also, record your duels against real players and watch them back. Every time you run out of energy or a grenade you have thrown doesn't hit, stop the vid and ask yourself why that happened and what you could have done to avoid it. Did your nade do no dmg because you predicted the enemy's movement wrong or because you missed the shot? Etc. This might help. Lots of points also apply to Tribes."
Tribes,2qch5f,mizzu704,2,Thu Dec 25 12:11:51 2014 UTC,Throw nades when you break line of sight. Only jet when they switch to explo or you need to get in a better position.

Tribes,2qch5f,ticklemethere328,1 point,Fri Dec 26 01:30:22 2014 UTC,"Kevintrinh, although I am still a budding duelist myself, I'll elucidate the factors important in many 1v1 games.  As people have said before, practice makes perfect. However, simple, non-involved practicing will do little to help you. (There are people that have played this game far longer than I, yet do not appear to improve.) Rather you must practice with an intense focus and maintain a constant critique of your moves. The goal is to internalize each game as best as is possible, filtering out the bad strategies and highlighting the good strategies.  There is a nice parallel, I believe, between tribes duels and chess. Just as expert chess players maintain a large repertoire of previous games that they then apply to their current game, so to do expert tribes duelists. When I predict where to fire nades in walled in, for example, I recall where people have gone in several prior games and toss nades to as many of these areas (generally only two) as possible. I find myself doing this with my meta as well. I think about what I did in a situation similar to the one currently facing my opponent, and find a way to counter it. This is essentially reading your opponent. Obviously you can't do this level of analysis in game efficiently. As you gain experience (assuming you have properly internalized it), your brain does the analysis for you; the aforementioned scenario plays out almost instantaneously, and with no internal dialogue.  As mentioned in the first paragraph, the key is to internalize quickly and with detail. If you enjoy reading literature on child prodigies, specifically the neuropsychological literature, you'll find that prodigies across disciplines internalize information quickly and with great intensity; that is, actually activating more parts of the brain, and activating them more strongly than non-prodigies. For prodigies, it comes genetically. For you and I, sustained effort is necessary. Sadly, I believe talent will still be the limiting factor.   TLDR: Research deliberate practice and that you apply that methodology to your tribes duels."
Tribes,2qch5f,Obyeag,1 point,Mon Dec 29 02:27:11 2014 UTC,What the fuck... I just shoot people when I see them... I guess that's why you're a better duelist than me.
Tribes,2qch5f,Will12239,1 point,Tue Dec 30 05:01:04 2014 UTC,"Can't really explain via text, but learn how to use inheritance for your nades. A short jump forward can double the distance you throw it. Jumping forward and throwing a nade behind you makes it almost hang still in the air to kill chasers. Just practice using inheritance.    Energy should only be expensed when an incoming shot will likely hit you. Hopping around is a great way to dodge shots while retaining energy. Many players jet up and use all their energy. Don't follow, wait for them to fall down and then you can simply hover shooting them helplessly."

Most people sucked in the beginning, but after time things change and with more play time everyone gets better. (except skard)"

Tribes,2q7g07,Xanthyr,1 point,Wed Dec 24 15:24:28 2014 UTC,I am 100% certain If Deadstop or legion plus Matin stayed together they would have continued to dominate. The only teams to consistently win tournaments. Were compromised of those players. Sorry Mario you are wrong.
Tribes,2q7g07,freefoodd,3,Wed Dec 24 17:40:39 2014 UTC,"There is also a huge contributing factor of low ping. After the servers moved, Deadstops defense would become much less dangerous in terms of straight dueling ability. Mabel had very low ping, and he and fire would hide around the stand until the last moment. Deadstop at their peak wouldn't stand to natl s2 and natl s3 teams. Due to game knowledge and much more informed and practiced opposition.   There is a lot of maybe and if with theory crafting the eras of the game, but I stand that teams effectiveness are exaggerated because we're left with a romanticized memory.  Legion was great too, but far from impervious. They were great and then the server switch hurt them as well, and were already shifting out of relevance as they adopted Hatuey shotgun LD.   Deadstop and Legion were good in their prime, but the server switch screwed a lot of their chain dependent players, made then easier to kill, better snipers become standardized makes the cappers of old even more useless.   You can say that the players would adapt to the changes of the game, but the fact is everyone left around the time they stopped dominating, lending to the thought that they were no longer a threat anymore as the playing field became much more even, better competition.   That and smaller changes like shrike grabs being slowed down to 200 from 300, and the myriad of other engine changes discoveries made since their dissolution means the game that CSN teams are disadvantaged vs natl s2/s3 teams."
Tribes,2q7g07,Xanthyr,2,Wed Dec 24 22:18:04 2014 UTC,"I'm not saying they'd continue to dominate playing the way they did when they were dominate. So I'm not disagreeing with what you are saying, only saying it's not really the point. The point is that despite the excessively constant changes to balance they stayed on top. They were adaptable, made intelligent decisions, and were mostly, mechanically great at games in general. None of that goes away over time, what went away for all of them was passion and purpose. If that had stayed, so would they and so would their dominance. I'm not saying other teams wouldn't have rose up to challenge them, in fact most of the time legion/deadstop and others WERE constantly challenged they weren't 5-0'ing everyone, just most everyone.   I like you have had the luxury of being here since the very very beginning. And I've witnessed the rise and fall of pretty much every single team. IMO there wasn't much higher of a peak then vex/tao/5150 during season1/2/3.  2/3rds of those players pretty much won 90% of the tournaments to exist. The other 1/3rd continued to dominate after everyone else had left. All of the information and styles everyone in this game used to emulate and or tried to surpass were compromised of pretty much the same top tier pool of players.   Also it's not like players like amazing players like fingerstyle and kigabit showed up once everyone good had left. They were here. Most everyone was here to some degree. So I'm not really saying they are/were impervious as lesser known/accomplished teams were able to best them every once in a while and teams like ego/zfz/a51/triumvirate/tao were constantly always near the top seperated by only 1 or 2 caps sometimes. Consistency was the difference if we are looking back WITHOUT rose tinted goggles.   Does anyone actually believe Kout of a few months ago would stand a chance in a tourney final against prime legion or deadstop with a few weeks to adapt to all of the new changes? I don't, but hey we agree to disagree and that is what makes this fun anymore. You know me, happy to debate this shit for hours."
Tribes,2q7g07,freefoodd,1 point,Thu Dec 25 00:39:25 2014 UTC,"I agree that overall skill in the remaining pool is diminished compared to properly motivated and equipped teams we once had. I understand that you took my point as a static screenshot of the teams' abilities vs the top teams in s2/s3 which I did kind of say, but I was saying that they left because their reign started to dwindle, but that doesn't cover everyone. Many dominant players stayed through the years and adapted, just as you and I have done, like remiCs and Vir, and Matin, who guess what, are on the same team!  I suppose I dislike disproportionate credit given to teams and players that fazed out, claiming a title that needs to be reevaluated.   That said, even with a couple weeks of adjustment, I think the ping crutched players would still not be able to cope and thus would be a detriment to the team, which was one of my main points I was making.   A long asked question was the wondering of what a full sized tribes LAN dreamhack would produce with everyone practiced.  A wet dream for me is going into a tournament with zero ping, mortar, and throwing discs on stand."

Tribes,2q8sqz,AFireInAsa,2,Wed Dec 24 06:01:37 2014 UTC,"yea there's also a lot of tells that are absent in t1 that people are so used to its hard for them to follow gameplay that doesn't have it. like permanent flag carrier icons, hitmarkers and hitsounds (on every bit of damage you do).  strings of plays that show consistency in the player are my favorites like that one. making sick plays on multiple cappers, doing something for the offense and defense, killing multiple people to return the flag, also plays like this one that show a lot of style"

Tribes,2q6ioe,The-not-so-funny-guy,14,Tue Dec 23 15:26:48 2014 UTC,"Basically if they're on, the bullets are 'simulated' or rendered client-side, so it looks like they're always coming straight from your gun in a regular stream. Because of latency, this is not where your bullets actually are on the server, so if you have a high ping your bullets may actually pass through people without hitting, because they're behind where you see them. If you turn it off, it will show you where the server sees your shots, which is generally a better idea, unless you have a really low ping. However, Hi-Rez's version of this isn't that great, so it might be advisable to get Magic Chain for a more accurate representation.  I hope that makes sense. Maybe someone else can explain it better."
Tribes,2q6ioe,Vondrak,6,Tue Dec 23 15:37:05 2014 UTC,"To give yet another version of an explanation:  Let's say you're on 60 ping and fire some chain bullets by pressing M1. It's gonna take 60 miliseconds (0.060 seconds) for your ""fire"" signal to get to the server. The server then processes that signal, ""officially"" creates the bullets, and since you're on 60 ping, it's gonna take another 60ms for the server to send your client the information that there are some bullets there at point XYZ with velocity S etc..   Your simulated projectiles setting has no influence on this process. The setting merely defines what your client actually shows you:  If simulated projectiles are off, your client draws the bullets according to the information it gets from the server. If you add the two values from above together, you realize this means that, on 60 ping, your client will draw the bullets 120ms after you pressed fire. The problem is that, at 120ms after pressing fire, the bullets have already been existing for 60ms, and since they travel so fast, they've gone quite the distance in the 60ms the server took to send you the signal. That's why, with sim projectiles off, chain bullets appear further away from you the higher your ping is, because the client doesn't know about their existence for 2*yourping after you firing (delayed information).  The idea of simulated projectiles now is to basically say: ""Okay, it's stupid for the client to draw the bullets only after it got the info from the server; The client knows I've fired, which obviously means that some bullets will come into existence (the client is the one who interprets pressing M1 as a fire signal in the first place, duh). Let's just let the client draw bullets immediately after the player fires."" So, with sim projectiles on, the client will create some ""inofficial"" bullets after 0ms (=instantly). You could say that this is the same as having 0 ping with sim projectiles off. Now, if we go back to the 60 ping scenario we can quickly see why doing this is a bad idea: The ""official"" bullets aren't created the instance the client gets a fire signal (0*yourping), they're created as soon as the server gets the information, which is 1*yourping. So now, the client draws your bullets way too early (wrong information), and again, this gets worse the higher your ping is. An ideal option would be for the client to look at your ping and just add it as a delay to the ""inofficial"" simulated bullets, and this is what Magic Chain does. PS: It's honestly quite pathetic how Hirez managed to fuck up something so simple and straightforward."

Tribes,2q2n3k,NeoSniper,2,Tue Dec 23 04:30:08 2014 UTC,"The nostalgia for T1 is what the other tribes have going for themselves. Personally I've been hopeful that newer tribes games would capture the feel and gameplay of the first. With the only change being an increase in scale. Feels to me that, despite better technology being available, newer tribes have been shrinking in scale rather than the opposite. Which blows my mind."
Tribes,2q2n3k,OmegaMilkShake,1 point,Wed Dec 24 20:31:20 2014 UTC,"The nostalgia for T1 is what the other tribes have going for themselves.   Not true. I haven't seen any other FPS with the unique gameplay that the tribes series has as a whole. It hits a niche audience that loves fast-paced, high learning curve FPSs, and that doesn't mean newer players can't enjoy Tribes Ascend without playing Tribes 1. There are people constantly leaving and joining the gaming world and a game logically can't be made based on nostalgia alone. The nostalgia factor might be why YOU play the other tribes, but everyone is different(which i find that almost everybody overlooks). Personally, I think HiRez is doing a great job with Tribes Ascend and I also think it would be ridiculous to spend tons of money and time to rebuild the same exact Tribes 1 except larger. Maybe if Tribes had a larger fanbase then a revamped Tribes 1 would be logical, but it doesn't therefore it's not."
Tribes,2q2n3k,NeoSniper,1 point,Wed Dec 24 22:54:58 2014 UTC,"Good points. Obviously from the point of view of a T1 player the whole series is going to be different from people who join 4 games later. My point was that T1 has T1 going for it. Not a strong argument was made but that was my point. Also I tried to express that for those of us (at least me) who played T1 it seems that each tribes game comes with the promise of capturing the magic of T1 and improving on it, but the interpretation of what each developer feels the T1 magic was is very different. Not to mention that the community is incredibly demanding and sometimes divided in what they want. Basically insatiable. That said the frustration comes tends to come with developers getting many things right. Skiing and mid airs feel really good to me in Tribes Ascend. But the rule set and base mechanics felt very poorly done and did not manage to provide a very satisfying experience for the defenders or raiders. Probably the player count gimped them from the beginning. But the experience felt small to me. Too much ramble sorry."
Tribes,2q2n3k,OmegaMilkShake,1 point,Thu Dec 25 17:20:50 2014 UTC,"Yes, absolutely. Forget about the better physics, chasing, weapon balance, air combat, and pace that T1 still has today in its LT servers. T:A is obviously the greatest Tribes game played today!  Did you even watch the video?"
Tribes,2q2n3k,VancouverKarma,1 point,Fri Dec 26 18:15:16 2014 UTC,"Before you get too butthurt; No, I wouldn't say T:A is the greatest Tribes game and I don't know why you're sarcastically saying that it is. Each Tribes game has their own nuances and variations that makes a player want to play it over the other. For obvious reasons, I'm not going to list every single thing they do differently. Your ""better"" is what's better for you, someone else's version of ""better"" may be different from yours. In my eyes, T1 doesn't have much going for it in the realm of modern games. What i mean by that is, new gamers are highly unlikely to pick up T1 over the modern T:A that has visibly better graphics even though it has an extremely bothersome weapon system."

Tribes,2py8dh,CallShenanigans,1 point,Sun Dec 21 05:29:53 2014 UTC,This usually happens when you have high textures with -notexturestreaming enabled. If you don't know what -notexturestreaming is you wont have it on so don't worry about it. If it is on either turn it off or turn down the world textures in the ini. If it is not on I dunoooo
Tribes,2py8dh,greenishmilk,1 point,Sun Dec 21 06:03:30 2014 UTC,This happens to me when one of the variables in the ini exceeds what the program or the card is capable of doing. You want select one of the presets and work from there.
Tribes,2py8dh,THEM0RNlNGW00D,1 point,Sun Dec 21 06:04:26 2014 UTC,Happens with the default .ini also though
Tribes,2py8dh,persuasionlaser,1 point,Sun Dec 21 06:21:02 2014 UTC,"http://pastebin.com/nnFVT0P7  Here, try this. It's the .ini I posted a while ago. Point being, I did some testing with lightmap/shadowmap and things like that and it's designed to work for both -notexturstreaming and normal. This way you'll know if it's something else causing the issue, although it just looks like an .ini issue."
Tribes,2py8dh,persuasionlaser,1 point,Sun Dec 21 11:32:48 2014 UTC,"Well the .ini you posted does work, however the graphics are extremely low and I want the detail to be higher. I suppose I have to narrow it down to one setting thats causing this glitch?"
Tribes,2py8dh,persuasionlaser,1 point,Sun Dec 21 20:12:19 2014 UTC,That's no problem. Your problem came about because of the lightmap/shadowmap settings being mismatched some way. It's been awhile since I messed with it so I can't remember correctly. You can bump up the other texture settings with no problem.   http://pastebin.com/PTNefUWH  That's what i'm using now. I played a little with notexturestreaming on earlier today and it worked fine apart from buildings being blacked out. Oh well. Other textures like skybox and the ground ect. can be changed without screwing anything up.
Tribes,2py8dh,ArmoredPenguin94,1 point,Sun Dec 21 20:43:49 2014 UTC,"Right well that ini you posted still is quite low in detail, but the darking is gone.

I would press them hard and call them on their bullshit... or, better yet, look around and see if you can find a smaller isp that promises no bandwidth caps.   You didn't by chance happen to note your ping elsewhere? That would give you a better idea how much you want to press this fight?   That pings are bad on a tribes server doesn't really mean anything: tribes servers have notoriously shitty internal routing, as do all virtual servers. You probably ping the front door of the host's location at 15ms (and have all along), yet get bounced around internally to crazy pings. That happened to me as a matter of routine.  If you knew that pings (routing) was better to other locations it would let you know whether to bother insisting getting back on the network you were on when you recorded 17mbits or just stick with what you have?"
Tribes,2pwbor,Pottytrainedtoilet,2,Sun Dec 21 01:36:11 2014 UTC,"My ping is kind of weird, on the same servers it's sometimes 35 and sometimes 105, yet it's only for the official ones and having good ping on unofficial servers means i have bad ping on official and vice verse. I have no idea. It has to be something fucky with tribes, because this kind of stuff happens knly in tribes and the pings in the server browser are almost all exactly the same number.

Tribes,2pturo,ellenok,2,Sat Dec 20 02:13:38 2014 UTC,I have really low sens from playing csgo. It's about 1 mouse pad distance to a 180.
Tribes,2pturo,Coniks,1 point,Sat Dec 20 03:23:27 2014 UTC,Buy bigger mousepad. So you can do one single arm move to make 180
Tribes,2pturo,Coniks,1 point,Sat Dec 20 10:11:04 2014 UTC,"I can,  I just use my wrist more than my arm usually unless I actually need to 180. I have been experimenting with higer sens though.

As a relatively new T:A player, when I see something like this, I find it absolutely mind boggling how people manage to come up with something so insane, the dedication of hours that go into making say a 400 route on Katabatic.  I do have few small questions hopefully you can answer.  1.) What is your process for figuring out these routes, is it trial and error, is there a ""route simulation"" program, how exactly do these come about?  2.) How exactly does the rock bouncing work? Shouldn't you actually just hit the rock and more or less stop because it is a rock and you are a person, and the game obviously won't let you shatter it even thought a person in a suit of metal going 400 KM/H would probably.  3.) What exactly is the full setup or are there multiple setups in terms of weapons/perks for going this fast, or is there a link to a database containing these?  This is real fucking cool and thanks for sharing."

Tribes,2pks8f,wordthompsonian,15,Wed Dec 17 15:17:17 2014 UTC,I haven't played any other tribes than ascend so I don't have anything to compare it to. But if you're talking about rock bouncing I think it is what makes capping in t:a fun. It takes a lot of hard work and repetition to pull off all the bounces. But there will always be a risk with every bounce you take as it might slow you down or send you of in a wrong direction.  It's all about the risk and reward.

The idea of communicating over just VGS in a competitive match seems silly today. Let alone playing over dial-up.    But it does make me question the nostalgia over how much 'deeper' the original games were."
Tribes,2pks8f,Schreq,1 point,Sat Dec 20 20:59:44 2014 UTC,"No doubt if people today would suddenly flood to play T2 competitively en masse the mechanics and play would be subject to an entirely new and different level of scrutiny. I suppose the issue of ""level of depth"" could be debated in that light - the general level of execution rising could lead to a less variable or more stale meta.  Despite that possibility, I feel T2 has two huge things going in favor for it - it lends itself to a much more varied map design when compared to T:A, and the addition of a secondary goal(the gen & naked spawning) - especially when taking the map thing into account - makes for a huge difference in terms of possible gameplay variety.  Being able to deny or delay equipment/assets is a pretty notable thing in T2, as is not having an auto-reset on K button - it forces teams to adapt to changing circumstances and deal with what ever hand they have on currently. In that manner, I find the gameplay to be a lot more fluid and chaotic (in a good way). Personally I enjoy that; One of my beefs with T:A has been that it feels very rigid in a ""set-up, execute, rinse, repeat"" -manner, and that there appears to be very little general change in terms of playstyles between maps. I can see why others would be annoyed with the T2 approach, though.  And in that vein, I'm not going to claim T2 is ""more skillful"". But I'll wager on saying that it does offer more  possibilities for varied play and varying playstyles."

Despite 4 trips across the Atlantic ocean I had virtually 0 packet loss, which was amazing.  Nowadays I don't have those same issues, but I've moved to a more rural area and I'm on a junky DSL connection. Now during peak evening hours I get alot of jitter/warp, which WTFast reduces but sadly doesn't eliminate. Normally to central I ping about 80 and get around 65 on WTFast.

The nitron is about the size of a tall can. I'm not sure the print volume on a Utlimaker 2 can do that. You might have to scale it.

Idk about EU and stuff, but if you're NA, choose a role, if it's your first time, you're probably playing offense.  Sit there, join a pub, and wait until there's enough people to start picking teams.  Once you get picked, you will get moved (or you might have to move yourself) to your team channel, where your captain will then tell you your roles.  If the channels Blood Eagle and Diamond Sword already have people, then they've already started a pug, so keep pubbing until their pug ends.  Go to tribes pug 1, pw is taoontop (I think.  Correct me if I'm wrong)"

However I wasn't there when this occurred so I'm not sure why you were removed. You should have your mic hooked up, ready to go, and set on push to talk (caps lock key is suggested) at all times since communication is of the utermost importance. NA PuGs don't start until 8 pm Eastern time at the earliest. Hope this helps"

Tribes,2p9ntx,THEM0RNlNGW00D,2,Sun Dec 14 17:22:56 2014 UTC,"If you want your montages to look like ultra without the performance impact during play I see no problem with it aside from tweaking the contrast curve a bit. If you're going for a more cinematic look you might want to try using the eyedropper to pick up the skybox cyan and adding it to your shadows when not inside a building. Most shadows tend to pick up the color of the secondary light source, when outside this tends to be the color reflected off gases and particles floating in the atmosphere.  Edit: or grab a bunch of LUTs presets and get some ideas."
Tribes,2p9ntx,TAWriggles,1 point,Sun Dec 14 18:14:25 2014 UTC,Wow thanks for the input I really appreciate it! I was originally going for some cinematic look (there were other effects on the video but this one by itself looked really nice). I like your idea about the secondary color source but by any chance could you link me a video explaining exactly how to do it? Thanks!

If you're got Premiere then its a snap, just google to get some free styles and its off to the races. If you're using Sony Vegas then you'll need to get a hold of Magic Bullet Suite which has a boatload of presets to choose from (also Premiere compatible.)

Hand discs on every class would allow for interesting animation canceling possibilities and the high impulse (how much someone gets pushed) would break up adadad fights / knock people up for mid airs (maybe even give a damage multiplier for MAs after handdiscing).  This would allow every class to blue plate + make Raiders / DMG more interesting to duel with.  Cappers could use them to clear, at the cost of slower nitronless routes, but defense could use them to knock cappers around (increasing the likely hood of a good chase vs just stuffing a capper on the stand)."

I think same damage as spare but ~400 splash and ~650 direct is good but have impulse like twins just slightly better for self. I'd say 3/4 or the same as that of a compacts impulse should be a nice area to start that way it can be used to gain speed but a useless option for cappers and chasers as disc/explosives/impacts would be obviously a better speed for health trade off. 2 hand disc jumps for a 100km/h boost or 2 explosives for 200km/h boost for the same health loss cappers will obiously go for the nitrons over a hand disc that's better for dueling and vis-versa for offense/stay at home d."

Probably by chunking weapons together as heavy/medium/light weapons/packs and three classes, but just making such a split in T;A doesn't seem like the best idea. It'd create for a lot of (if not completely overpowered) annoying combinations and the bandaiding of arbitrarily disallowing certain combinations would just make for an even more arbitrarily complex and band-aidy setup than we already have."

Tribes,2p8nak,TAWriggles,1 point,Tue Dec 16 23:30:01 2014 UTC,infact every class should have the tc24 or the nj4 or 5 as a desperation 3rd weapon. so noobs still have somthing to use.
Tribes,2p8nak,JaidTribes,1 point,Tue Dec 16 23:40:07 2014 UTC,"Going back to a light/medium/heavy system would be great, mortars being heavy only with restriction from the sniper rifle, mediums can use everything besides mortars and snipers and of course no mortars for lights but allow them to snipe, also make a universal spin like its always been, instead of having the multiple varieties we have, give everyone the dueling or blinks options and remove the devastator/jug spins and the soldier/inf spins and keep the damage 770 so we don't have mediums and heavys 1 shotting lights. Tribes never had one shot kill weapons and always had the exact same weapons over all classes that did the same exact damage, also certain packs for certain weight classes, no cloaks for mediums/heavys, no jammer/shield packs for lights well maybe jammers, also allow everyone access to survival/energy regen/ammo/thrust pack options. I also like mstarrs idea for the throwing discs but let's just make it the same damage as the spare spin with 400 splash instead of 600 also give it twinfusor like self impulse but a little bit stronger maybe about 3/4 the self-impulse of compact or maybe impact nitrons, so they can give some speed but nothing compared to impacts/explosive/disc jumps and deffinetly not good for route running, obviously let's say 20-50km/h boost from a hand disc while an explosives/disc jump gives 60-100 km/h boosts. also give the tech access to jammer deployables and force fields they should be able to deploy anything they want I mean they are ""technicians"" it would be just fine with a limit, 2 turrets(even ability to have 1 exr and 1 light turret at a time), 2 force fields, 2 jammers at a reasonable distance from each other jammer planted by the team to prevent huge areas being blanket jammed, they had a system in T1 which kept you from deploying the same things too close to one another. Also 3 weapons and 2-4 nades/mines for Lights, 4 weapons and 3-5 nades/mines for mediums and 5 weapons and 4-6 nades/mines for heavys with only a few weapons restricted to their respective weight classes (these are just numbers I remember from base T1, they would obviously differ depending on your packs/nade types and how the loadouts varied)  also give us access to rifles based on weight classes that make sense or revert back to having all classes share one common chaingun weapon like it was long before T:A, this is the only place I would prefer to have options tho(one of the few changes I liked about T:A, rifle variations make more sense then explosive weapon variation and are easier to balance with fire rate and damage per bullet to average out a common DPS also scoped rifles like NJ5/LAR have uses different from their NJ4/AR counter-parts) here's my class & rifle/pistol combo's that make sense to me, LAR/Rhino/AR&Gast/NJ4/Falcons/SN7/Nova Blasters/Knives/Sparrow for lights, LAR/Rhino/SN7/AR&Gast/NJ4&5/TCN smg/Colt/Eagle/also some of the same light options, and the chain gun/x1 options with like a 150-250 bullet ammo capacity, and of course for heavys we have all the mediums and some of the same light chain weapons but instead we heavy's get larger ammo capacity compared to the medium/light rifles with same name/damage output and fire rate except for a select few weapons like Nova Blaster/Throwing Knives/Falcon from lights and the Gast/NJ5/Eagle from mediums which are weight class specific, as for sabers/titan launchers and those feel like they belong on Heavys because they are almost like tank weapons, just like they were in T1/T2/T:V but we need to add flare grenade options to every class as another option instead of having to only shoot missles down. Similar to what they had in T2 for cappers to avoid missle turrets/rocket launchers. Also make frags/explosive nitrons/ap/sticky/hand discs universal, only limit nitrons/T5 to lights cluster/emps/blackouts to mediums and fractals to heavys also get rid of those god awful shortfuse's/defectives/repair kits, they use no skill really.  Bring back classic mines that wont do retarded ammounts of damage on its own like the DMB/SEN retarded 700 damage claymores and mines that normaly kill a light capper in 1 shot or cripple a medium capper down to half health and are a pain in the ass to clear because they don't explode because of near by splash damage as easily as you'd think they would/should to make offense/self clears possible, drop them down to 250-350 damage so they are still useful and give snipers a head start that isn't too big that they will 1 shot you if you hit 1 mine. also have the capacity you can carry vary on your weight class just like nades (I miss mine-disking, it was the only skillful way to 1shot a light and even possibly mediums if lucky) also give the classic loadouts back like the classic 3 weapon capper/offense loadout chain/gl/disc on lights for example sure you could sub anything out for another weapon when I did play LO I used plasma/disc/gl for base rape instead because chain sucked indoors so plasma was the better choice, that's what I miss, just being able to change up one weapon to fill a whole new role. Oh! and give everyone access to plasma/gl/arx and make the jackal/boltlauncher a light/medium weapon and the gladiator/hbl a medium/heavy weapon and get rid of all the stupid different variations of the same god damn explosive weapons just with different damage outputs and just focus on balancing those single weapons to work across all classes so noone can claim one class is more OP than another when we can all have the choice to use the same weapons as anyone else given our weight class can, I think very minor restrictions are needed like on the launchers/mortars/snipers and such to make people use each weight class to complete a job and to keep it balanced, it would be unbalanced to have a 250km/h path running around the perimiter of a base spamming mortars, just like it wouldn't be balanced to have a 2600hp sniper or a 2600hp inf or 2600hp path. So restricting thrust to light and mediums, and also restricting snipers/cloaks to lights keeps things fair, also in T1 you couldn't snipe without an energy pack so there weren't any invisible/shielded snipers really, well except in annihilation mod, but I'm going off base only!  Sorry for the rant, this is just how I feel about the topic and how I'd make the game in my opinion better/funner and much less bland and repetitive and unlock the true potential of this great franchise that was stupidly changed from an already great franchises game mechanics, versatility and customizability that it had since day one and Hi-Rez really screwed the pooch on sticking to an already working system. We tried to tell them, but oh well.  TL:DR my huge rant of changes to make T:A like a true tribes game like T1/T2/T:AA/T:V always was and how tribes was always supposed to be with flexability and customization for each weight class being more capable of performing certain job duties all while being able to have enjoyably versatile playstyles with only very small weapon restrictions that just make sense. That's the problem with T:A's different classes, they strayed too far from the original concepts. Even tho I still enjoy the game it pains me to see it fall so far from its roots and become so bland and casual."

Tribes,2p0f88,eightnine,1 point,Fri Dec 12 06:58:14 2014 UTC,i have been talked with my provider's operator and she said that this a modem problem... but idk if it's true
Tribes,2p0f88,eightnine,2,Fri Dec 12 11:49:11 2014 UTC,"It's not your modem, otherwise you'd have the same problem during the day. It's just italian shitty ISPs being shittier than usual. I have Telecom Italia and my ping has jumped from a regular 31ms (2-3 months ago) to a constant 80ms during the evenings and 100+ during the day."
Tribes,2p0f88,eightnine,1 point,Fri Dec 12 14:49:23 2014 UTC,eight quindi quello che mi ha detto l'operatore che ci sono stati dei problemi generali di server in tutta italia è vero? però l'operatore mi ha detto che è stato un problema di giovedì sera... io però è da martedì che pingo così quindi?
Tribes,2p0f88,eightnine,1 point,Sat Dec 13 11:07:16 2014 UTC,"Può essere che abbiano problemi generali, ma a volte il problema è che hanno troppi utenti su una centrale, quindi dirottano il traffico su altre centrali più capienti (e più distanti). Per esempio io ero collegato ad una centrale a 2 km da casa mia, quindi pingavo 10ms al primo hop, adesso la centrale è satura e vengo sempre dirottato su una centrale più distante. Risultato: ho 40ms al primo hop.       Spero non sia la stessa cosa che è successa a te, perchè a quanto ne so non c'è una soluzione (a parte cambiare provider)."
Tribes,2p0f88,eightnine,1 point,Mon Dec 15 07:01:44 2014 UTC,no io sono sempre su quella centrale e infatti la mattina e il pomeriggio non ci sono problemi: ho sempre il ping stabile da 46 a 58. è la sera che ho un ping che sale da 160 a oltre 200. può quindi essere che la telecom o altre compagnie abbiano dirottato utenti sulla centrale dove sono io che è molto grande. quello che però non riesco a spiegarmi è perchè sul server di ams e ldn pingo così e se invece vado su quello nae che dovrei pingare di più invece pingo di meno? a sto punto sto pensando ci siano problemi di proxy!
Tribes,2p0f88,IndigenousOres,1 point,Mon Dec 15 12:01:55 2014 UTC,"prova a pingare su 192.168.100.1 al pomeriggio e poi alla sera, se rimane lo stesso ping non è un problema di centrale. A quel punto può essere routing, uno dei server in mezzo ci mette un po' a rispondere, quindi puoi provare WTFast."

Tribes,2os60p,persuasionlaser,3,Tue Dec 9 20:41:05 2014 UTC,"The biggest problem with the draft tournaments is that the people who run them - they tend to get burnt out rather quickly.  It's quite stressful trying to get enough people together, convincing enough people to volunteer to captain (even worse than PUGs!), and running the thing over the weekend. That's why I always supported whoever wanted to run it - helping out with the site whilst they dealt with the players.  I'm sure the draft format could easily be done elsewhere.

Tribes,2ouuqq,CasualBBT,11,Wed Dec 10 11:44:53 2014 UTC,I think H3art does. Can't imagine his aim being that bad otherwise  loveubby
Tribes,2ouuqq,Ninewatts,6,Wed Dec 10 18:32:58 2014 UTC,"I used a sens toggle throughout my entire tribes (and bf3, csgo, etc) career.  Press to raise, release to lower.  While pressed you look w/ wrist, and then release and aim with arm.  This allows me to run absurdly low sens without ever lifting my mouse - I think it will be fair superior for a small desk.  You'd have to crank up accel to for you to use that much less space, and you'll still ahve a lot of space issues while just skiing around.  It will feel awkward at first, but I think it's teh best solution.  Also, I think Tribes is one of the few games where acceleration is especially bad.  While trying to track someone who is ADADADAing, you abruptly jerk your mouse when they change directions - acceleration is gonna make this rly awkward"
Tribes,2ouuqq,manbra,-1,Wed Dec 10 13:48:48 2014 UTC,"Protips here. I also prefer the setup of having a DPI clutch button that raises DPI for quick movements, but using a low sensitivity overall.  Acceleration is ALWAYS to be avoided."
Tribes,2ouuqq,Treefusor,5,Wed Dec 10 15:51:31 2014 UTC,Acceleration is ALWAYS to be avoided.   Why? That statement is total bs. Acceleration is useful and with the use of an accel offset can be setup so it just kicks in on fast swipes if you want to turn 180 or w/e.  It's just a proof of concept but check this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEamcaYyoa0  And from the description: 366cm/360° + accel to about 44cm/360°
Tribes,2ouuqq,Schreq,1 point,Wed Dec 10 16:19:35 2014 UTC,it's still bad for your aim because you won't have good muscle memory at all when using accel
Tribes,2ouuqq,plsbangmywife,3,Sat Dec 13 08:17:23 2014 UTC,"That statement keeps popping up but is totally debatable. First of all accel != accel. In games where you have good control over every aspect of mouse acceleration, one can have a lot of accel or just a tiny bit. Not to mention offset and senscap.  Secondly the human brain can adapt to a lot of things. With accel, it's just that speed affects how much you turn and who says you can't memorize speed as well?"

But if you wanna try it out, try this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORL144_co8  Lengthy but it does teach you how to fine tune the nature of your sens at varying speeds.     I have mine set up (oh my god this guy has his mouse setup settedup in a way I don't like!!!)  so that a quick flick o da wrist gets me 180, while a very slow smooth steady glide over ~14cm gets me 180 too."
Tribes,2ouuqq,scke,2,Wed Dec 10 13:07:52 2014 UTC,"You could try this, http://www.reddit.com/r/Tribes/comments/ydkuo/chain_hero_script/  It just changes your sensitivity when you hold down mouse 1.  Personally, depending on your space I would just get better using a higher sensitivity, its not that hard.  I used to play 400 dpi and 20, now I play 400 dpi and 7, and I hit around the same amount of chain.  However, if you are sniping, high sensitivity kinda sux.  But for chaining, its like high sense skips pixels but you also have really high sense so you can correct where your cursor should be very quickly."
Tribes,2ouuqq,pard0n99,2,Wed Dec 10 19:02:40 2014 UTC,Using accel is totally fine.  Only problem is unreal doesn't give you much control over it. You could use quake accel driver to get consistent accel in all games.  http://teamfortress.tv/thread/5067/?page=1
Tribes,2ouuqq,Schreq,1 point,Wed Dec 10 13:10:55 2014 UTC,"with Nvidia Surround you dont need accel :D  overshooting targets is a bad thing if the game has no 360yoloscope  bug. if you can handle it by doing a reversed flick shot its something you can practise to use accel.   keep the scenario in mind where you checked a corner quickly and that guy comes out behind something just after that. (i liked to have my aim in line for this, and play more over the mouse position and movement back in the days, decades w/e)  the more vision you get while turning will change the distance you have to move the mouse of course, in some games its worse in others its shit because your fps will be kind of stable for the flickshot."
Tribes,2ouuqq,lllllllolyolo,1 point,Sat Dec 13 16:38:52 2014 UTC,"A lot of people are saying mouse acceleration is too inconsistent for muscle memory. I would have to disagree. Although it is more tricky, the mouse will always accelerate in the same way, leading to predictability based on how fast you swipe.   I personally stopped using it a few years ago and I'd never go back, but it is possible to be quite good with acceleration on."
Tribes,2ouuqq,ihatethissite,0,Wed Dec 17 19:49:36 2014 UTC,"I used to. It was bad.  DPI toggle probably best, but what sens are you running anyway?"
Tribes,2ouuqq,persuasionlaser,0,Wed Dec 10 23:09:56 2014 UTC,"No way, hardly anyone uses it. It makes muscle memory very hard to develop. I'd bet 98% of pro counter strike players don't use it. Get a bigger mouse pad. Low sens players have had giant mousepads for 20 years now. Try the Steelseries Qck Heavy"
Tribes,2ouuqq,Will12239,2,Fri Dec 12 20:43:12 2014 UTC,"cs is just a bad example. It's a slow tactical shooter where more often than not gunplay is about crosshair positioning, prefiring and click reaction speed. But also because accel is fps dependant in cs:go (maybe the others too, no idea). So unless you cap fps quite low, you will have inconsistent acceleration. Check quake for instance. I can say the exact opposite of your statement: 98% (arbitrary number) of pro q3/ql players use accel.  Why the majority of gamers don't use accel is because of myths like these but also because in most games, the settings, to fine tune mouse acceleration, aren't good enough or simply lacking."
Tribes,2ouuqq,Schreq,1 point,Sat Dec 13 14:58:27 2014 UTC,Most QL players do not use mouse accel. At least none of the top aimers do. My issue mouse acceleration is no myth- it constantly alters your distance for mouse swipes leading to no cumulative muscle memory.
Tribes,2ouuqq,Will12239,2,Sat Dec 13 23:47:22 2014 UTC,"The question is, are they better aimers because of no acceleration or because of lower sens? Or maybe simply because they are more talented aimers? Have the less aim based players not developed muscle memory with their accel settings? Are the more strategy oriented quake pros totally horrible at aiming because of their mouse acceleration? No they are not, they still have amazing aim.   it constantly alters your distance for mouse swipes   Yes, but it's not some random distance every time. You, yourself affect that distance depending on how fast you move your mouse. And that distance/speed can be memorized --> muscle memory.  Anyway, my point is that mouse acceleration is personal preference and I didn't really like the ""no one in cs uses it so it must be bad"". Let people try it for them-selfs, don't just tell them it's the worst thing ever, because that is simply not true. Maybe it affects your aim negatively in certain situations but it can also help in others. As with everything, like fov for instance, it's trade-offs."
Tribes,2ouuqq,Schreq,1 point,Sun Dec 14 01:06:32 2014 UTC,"Yes, but it's not some random distance every time. You, yourself affect that distance depending on how fast you move your mouse. And that distance/speed can be memorized --> muscle memory.   I've missed hundreds of shots on people by miss swiping under 1in without mouse acceleration. Had I not miss swiped that extra 5mm, my shot would've been true. For someone with mouse acceleration, every aim is going to have that pretty big unknown variability. Sure, the experienced players might have an idea of where the cursor will end up, but even the tiniest movements are critical in fps. I truly think low sens, no mouse accel is the fastest way to improve muscle memory and aim. I just cannot see a mouse acceleration user mastering 180 degree swipes with any sort of insane accuracy."
Tribes,2ouuqq,Will12239,2,Sun Dec 14 03:28:54 2014 UTC,"As I said before, it's trade-offs but also depends on the game. In quake your rockets are going to suffer with low sens. Using accel gives you the ability to keep your sens low but also be fast in close quarter situations, which in turn then MIGHT hurt other situations again. All you talk about is the potential disadvantages while completely ignoring the advantages, as if shooters were only about 180 degree swipes with insane accuracy. Also what you don't seem to understand is the concept of senscap: You can have accel and have a consistent sens for quick swipes. Don't tell me now one would still have inconsistent slow 180s then :D Accel has its use cases and especially in the case of the Op I thought it could be useful and,  oh wonder, he confirmed with his edit."

He has, and they are indeed good...the site is new but awesome, functional, and (most importantly) well supported. The community is cool too, and growing. Time will tell of course, but the foundation is certainly there.   Haven't talked about it much here but I am working on a game too, and we plan to host our leagues and tourneys through DGL. Plus I am doing semi-weekly articles for their blog. There are only a few games supported so far, but the idea was to make sure everything is solid before expanding, and I think they are at a good point for that, which is probably why Link is asking if people would like a Tribes NA division there. I'm guessing the community interest for the game may have waned too much already, but we all still got love for tribe so what the hell, doesn't hurt to ask. (More draft tourneys would be fun tho!)

Tribes,2oongj,ShiningRayde,3,Mon Dec 8 22:08:19 2014 UTC,"If I may;  In your plot section, you have the starting date labeled as '2955', which I'm hoping is a typo. This is problematic in many regards; first and foremost, it's actually elaborated on in the recognized timeline - that date takes place between Emperor Caanon I's declaration of the Hunt and the beginning of Unitech's battles with their own resurrected Prometheus shard - while there was some fluff about Bioderms in this time, the general point is that they're still enslaved fully by humans, and are simpler versions of those seen in MF:Cyberstorm.  Moving the date to 3955 puts it roughly 5 years after the last 'official' timeline stamp, wherein the Tribes of Man have turned back the Bioderms and are marching on the McCrae Lattice; 5 years is a long time for Tribal warfare, and if they got bogged down in a war of attrition for that long the Tribes might well lose anyways as the Bioderms keep adding reinforcements.  My next issue is your statement; ""Gender isn't important"" when discussing characters. Not that I'm going to launch into a SJW post, on the contrary, I think you should put a lot of effort into thinking out the characters. Women in the wilderzone have quite a lot going on for them - if it weren't for the breastplates and CoP/wolves running around half nude, you wouldn't know a Tribal was female until they spoke or took off their armor. Tribal women are described as being 'forward and sexually open by Imperial standards', with very much a mentality of 'If my armor lifts as much as your armor, what does it matter?' Women serving in the Tribal forces almost always have to take vows of chastity/internal contraceptives, which is another topic entirely.  Moving on; 'Yost's armor' being so specialized that it couldn't be repaired by a field facility would be out of line for Blood Eagle; they more than any other tribe try not to get too attached to one suit of armor, though it does happen. Disregarding that, modifying the suit so extensively would make repairs difficult, and Tribals are nothing if not pragmatic - he'd be laughed out of the barracks every time a custom component failed and he had to wait a week for replacements.  As for casting: Keeping to the Great Four is reasonable, though a bit dull... consider sub-Tribes within one of the Great Four. And while Goggles and Yost are workable bloodnoms, Damascus feels a bit too pointed and... well, calling the Phoenix 'Phoenix' is just repetitive. Running gag; Phoenix never gets to tell anyone her bloodnom, always getting cut off, so everyone starts calling her Phoenix as associated to her Tribe rather than her handle.  Finally:   It should be noted no game cannon has depicted the empire's war with the Bioderm insurrection.   What is Stellar 7 and Nova 9? Gir Draxon didn't get his shit pushed in by an asshole in a hover tank for nothing.  You've got some good ideas, and some okay ones. It needs a lot of polish though; Red Vs. Blue didn't come from just one guy, and a lot of attempts were made after them to try and catch that shooting star; not a lot of them made it very far."
Tribes,2oongj,ShiningRayde,3,Tue Dec 9 02:10:04 2014 UTC,"Dear sweet Jesus thank you! Yes that was a typo and I honestly didn't expect feedback. Will edit doc after digestion.  As much as I'd love to make some big huge name for myself with machinima. No. That isn't happening. Tribes 2 is what, twelve, thirteen years old? Barring every other internet wannabe trying to the point of over saturation I have no illusions. I just want to cross this off my bucket list at this point without the end result being a steaming pile of goat shit.  Look all I'd ever done was rough scenarios since it'd never looked like I could get resources or help so Yea. Continuity is more than a touch.... Meh. Didn't help most of what I'd done was write from memorywith a few glances at wiki.  My intent was roughly five years after tribes 2 and the situation I always had in mind was treating Lonewolf as a fictionalization of events. One guy verses an entire base of bioderm? One guy retaking key assets to retake ymir? Same guy doing both?  Wait. Crap. I never actually played Stellar 7, and I'd just guessed the Empire vs Bioderm thing was cooked up for tribes 2 as a failed attempt at 'hey the whole created verses creator thing worked before, let's use the vat grown nooks from the cyberstorm games.'  Hey look. You want edit privileges? Errors can be fixed and I'd more or less been working in a vaccum, which is really shity when you're not sure on the mistakes you're making. Just this one response is more feedback than I'd gotten in a decade.  As for names I'd listed it as tribe/name.  But Names are something I kinda suck at so figure can clean up later if I ever got past the idea stage. The scenario details are less important than all the before stuff detailing the problems I'm going to have. Blind spots need ironing out so it's not just one asshole screaming at the internet.  Finally, at least for now, let me address Gender. I intended that 'gender isn't important' as more 'both are an option and I don't want to lock things down. Plus with powered armor you have basically an erasure of excuses why women cannot serve. Sure there arguments thinking methodologies tied to gender would cause role preferences, but end of the day the two questions are 'can they shoot straight? And are they going to not freak out in the field?' I didn't intend on leaving the impression women are useless. Just that roles can be made. Fit either gender without having. Sit and gut/redo.  Pilot details can/will be redone following your advice. I still want to roll with using katabatic since it's effectively tribes 2's blood gulch. Having 'guy get chased into practice/arena grounds' seems like a good setup.    Thumb typing sucks. Just as a for the record thing."
Tribes,2oongj,CallShenanigans,3,Tue Dec 9 02:23:54 2014 UTC,"Sorry, my nerd-focus is the Starsiege Universe; if you look through my comment history on this subreddit, it's all 'that's actually canon', 'they wouldn't because this', 'this little thing in the tribe tech handout specifies...' etc.  I want to stress that I understood what you meant by 'gender doesn't matter'; I know you didn't mean anything by it. What I meant was that you should make something of it, because it's an interesting and undersold part of the universe, and somewhat relevant in our current era of integrating women into combat roles and the challenges and opportunities it brings.  Stellar 7 and Nova 9 join 'Hunter/Hunted' in the dubious honor of being retconned in as 'canon'. Recall that the original Earthsiege story was just 'the future, but then cybrids used nukes!', while Starsiege added the Collapse and the Church of Hunter and the Age of Hope... Stellar 7 and Nova 9 were independent games that were linked to the plot, iirc, around the time Tribes 2 was being planned, borrowing the name Gir Draxon and the idea that the Scourge already nearly assaulted Earth twice. Besides, that makes this the BBEG super intelligent biowarmachine and charismatic super leader that's currently destroying the galaxy.  I'd almost argue that you shouldn't do your own story until you have the mechanism down, the style of writing and pacing you want. And if that were the case; maybe consider making a machinima-drama of the Prophecy of Tears story. I actually sat down once and tried to plan out how to adapt it to the stage; it's a great piece of drama and some good scenes for acting, but you'd have to figure out how to infer motion and speed on a static stage, and while I played with the idea of carefully covering the lower portion of the stage to hide rollers the actors are on, and Circe-de-solie style acrobats swinging around...  Okay, maybe TOO much time thinking about this universe."
Tribes,2oongj,Kirotera12,2,Tue Dec 9 02:48:28 2014 UTC,"The one problem there is while tribes engine offers a /lot/of motion, it's actually still too limited to show the franticness of the big duel at the end of prophecy of tears, and rankly for that piece of fighting you'd want Monty Ohms or some other actual animator for the sequences.  Tribes 2 has everyone more or less standing ramrod straight while jetting about so it'd feel silly. Plus you'd miss a lot with the derm infiltrator, especially the bits with him trying to dump enough pheromones to keep Kensie and that other woman under his thumb.  I'd thought five years after Tribes 2 since Prophecy of Tears/start of war is ten years before, and while I figure Shi Draconas Alpha as the event that breaks the wilerzon incursion as a cohesive war there would be decades of spotting bioderm forces holing up on this world or that with the further possibility of it turning into factions within their forces because they aren't getting reenforced from the empire (wasn't the wilderzone where the scourge more or less dumped their worst units as a 'hey it'll cut off any possibility of the empire calling on aid or harvesting resources from those worlds and it gets rid of the dead weight.')  As for what I should do? Feedback has always been a problem, as in lack of. Hard to improve when nobody's saying what's wrong and a bunch of people are going 'you're writing for the wrong reasons if you're seeking feedback.'  The actual script would be more focused. That was just me spitballing. Give an example and preferred location."

Tribes,2oiqao,evanvolm,2,Sun Dec 7 03:43:18 2014 UTC,Really? Because I stopped playing TA because it was getting really low traffic. I live on the east coast of the US and the last time I tried to play it was taking 20-30 minutes to find a game all day.  edit: They weren't PUGs so there's that. I only played Ascend for a year or so back when I was into it. Are PUGs very significantly more active?
Tribes,2oiqao,Zwitterions,4,Sun Dec 7 03:51:44 2014 UTC,Are you using quick play to find a match? Make sure you're using the server browser to find them.
Tribes,2oiqao,Obyeag,1 point,Sun Dec 7 06:28:22 2014 UTC,"That's strange, east NA is probably the most populated region currently, you should probably expand your search for servers to central as well. Pubs are more active than pugs but can be a little hit or miss for number of players, late night pugs are usually pretty consistent (to my knowledge) but are not very noob friendly."
Tribes,2oiqao,persuasionlaser,1 point,Sun Dec 7 03:59:41 2014 UTC,"Thanks, I'll try that. I'll also see if the PUGs are more active than matchmaking servers if Tribes Ascend is still the most populated game in the franchise."
Tribes,2oiqao,DarcseeD,2,Sun Dec 7 04:04:19 2014 UTC,"NA pug's generally start at around 8pm East, but the number of pug's played each day is varied.   I don't mean to sound rude, but if you don't have a decent bit of game experience than you may want to stick to pubs for the time being. We would love to have new players join us, but pretty much everyone who pugs has played quite a while so it's pretty difficult for new players to get into it.   If it interests you though, I encourage you to try it out. A microphone is heavily encouraged but as long as you're clear about communicating your need for some help, everything will be alright."
Tribes,2oiqao,THEM0RNlNGW00D,2,Sun Dec 7 11:56:11 2014 UTC,"I like to think that I'm ok, I just might need some help with knowing what to do at what time. I have a mic, I'd just need to get mumble.   Implying VGS and VGW isn't communication enough."
Tribes,2oiqao,persuasionlaser,1 point,Sun Dec 7 21:54:56 2014 UTC,"Why would you use match making instead of immediately joining a server via the server browser?  I could maybe understand using match making in a game that has a lot of players and a good match making system, so that you actually get placed in servers with people of your own skill level, but that has never been the case with T:A."
Tribes,2oiqao,zombieofthepast,1 point,Sun Dec 7 09:52:31 2014 UTC,"Pugs are kinda still around but there are some tryhards killing the fun for many people. Just drop in an goof around, can't hurt to see what happens."

Tribes,2oiqao,Meremothy,5,Sun Dec 7 08:13:20 2014 UTC,"What about a non-Tribes game to get your Tribes fix, is there anything out there or on the horizon?  There's absolutely nothing else like Tribes that I know of, but maybe there is something upcoming that I don't know about that someone else could shed some light on?  Or maybe there is currently something out that I'm just not aware of.  Whatever happened to that one game that was very Tribes-esque, but I think there was only a limited number of people working on it, can't remember the name for the life of me though.  Or at the very least what's a good fast-paced FPS that's up and coming?  I still do, always will love, and will still play Tribes: Ascend.  Only reason I'm asking here is because I don't trust non-Tribes players to give me suggestions, to be perfectly honest, hah."

Tribes,2o6kpk,Lowerend,3,Sat Dec 6 01:37:51 2014 UTC,"The dis-appointment is rather easy and I've done that. It's not that difficult to accomplish if you set out to do it.  The organiser I've done a couple of times as well, but since it's such a low damage it's more about being lucky and getting that hit on a low health target. Clairvoyant I haven't really done, because I don't tend to melee them. Both because it's easier to just shoot them in the fact, but also because it's quite the bother to melee an inf with close combat to death. I've most certainly done it and gotten air mails and blueplates on cloaked infs though. It's not too difficult. I've tax returned a few times, but mostly with some random timing and a shrike. If you run over a dumbbringer with the shrike right as they launch the sabre then it'll blow up on you when they're on low health. I've done axis of evil on stand, but not mid-route. These tend to just happen randomly if you play enough and get into situations that allow for it.  I've not done a classic though. Getting inventory station kills is hard enough as it is.  The final measure Shoot a spinfusor disc and have the explosion when it expires kill an enemy mid air.  The single player team player Grab the flag and punt it, respawn and catch your own pass without the flag touching the ground.  The team plate Land a midair on a full health heavy right as your team mates also land mid airs on it to, killing it instantly.  The DODO Have someone pass you the flag right as you try to shoot an enemy, hit the flag instead to blow yourself and your passing teammate up."

Really though, you're not meant to be able to reliably MA someone that's actively dodging your shots. T;A doesn't allow for it due to the super mario physics (aka high air control) and slow+small explosive projectiles mean that it's fairly easy to reliably dodge incoming fusor discs. They can even react after you fire your shot and be somewhere else, even if the shot was perfectly aimed... unless they're moving predictably or are very close. That's why there are very powerful autos in T;A."
Tribes,2o79wb,WhiskyJak,1 point,Wed Dec 3 23:44:45 2014 UTC,And that's why the game died immediately. Amongst other hirez blunders
Tribes,2o79wb,Shaeress,1 point,Thu Dec 4 05:25:46 2014 UTC,"T;A needs powerful long range weaponry with high reliability (which also explains the sniper rifles). Super mario physics, slow speed building, high speed retention and health regen means that it's very difficult to hit people with explosives at any kind of range, that you can't chase them down and that they'll come back with full health soon enough. Besides, autos aren't overpowered except amongst players that have high accuracy, good positioning and movement as well as good energy and health management. It was very much possible for someone that only played pubs to never really have an issue with autos, no matter how much they played (which is kind of what happened to me). The power of autos isn't of much significance in the grand scheme of T;As failure."

Tribes,2nwjpu,Naivy,4,Mon Dec 1 03:06:46 2014 UTC,"Oh Legions.  Poor Legions.  As already stated, it has some nice ideas within it, downjet likely being the best and most unique.  It's unfortunate that no other game tried this, though it might show up in Z.  The Overdrive mechanic is sort of a 'love it or hate it' thing.  The game was built around overdrive so you can't really take it out of the game, even if a number of people wanted just that.  The most popular and well-liked map in Legions (Frostbyte) would probably turn to shit without overdrive.  It's comparable to the grappler I guess.   I also feel the regen mechanic was done rather nicely, and would've been a much better replacement in T:A if Hi-Rez were dead-set on having one.  Basically, you only regained health if you were walking on the ground.  Cappers couldn't regen mid-route or any of that nonsense.  A separate regen core/pack was introduced later on which also had a nifty AOE if held down long enough.  Speaking of cores, the Warp core was also quite unique and powerful in the right hands.  I'll just cut this short and say the game is fun, but dead.  The servers are up, but no one is playing anymore.  The forums are also pretty much dead.  No funds for advertising, coupled with a very restrictive licensing agreement really put a short lifespan on the game."
Tribes,2nwjpu,evanvolm,2,Mon Dec 1 05:25:38 2014 UTC,It's comparable to the grappler I guess.    And buckler at the same time. I was not a fan of it but I can see how it can make for fast game-play and did like how it was a health trade-off mechanic also. I just wasn't good at it.
Tribes,2nwjpu,qhp,1 point,Mon Dec 1 05:47:25 2014 UTC,"A wonderfully high skill ceiling so wasted. I think someone here (Me, most likely) should poke the guys who own it for the license and stuff. Seeing as I am founding a company, I might keep one eye on this thing."
Tribes,2nwjpu,evanvolm,2,Mon Dec 1 07:01:58 2014 UTC,"If you feel like taking action, now is the time.  There's nothing to really 'keep an eye on' anymore.  Bear in mind it isn't a few guys who own the IP, it's IAC.  If you're serious you should probably contact BugsPray, who has (or had) direct contact with the right people at IAC.  You'll also need a few good men who won't slit their wrists working with Torque.  If by some miracle you get hold of the game, I'd recommend either porting it to T3D (a plan at one point) or some other modern engine."

Depending on who's paying for the game to be made, who's developing the game and why they're making it... if it was a financial success, those involved in the process of its creation would see nothing wrong with it ;p."

Tribes,2nwwkx,yeum,2,Mon Dec 1 05:31:37 2014 UTC,"I tested this ages ago, and unless something's changed, it's pretty hacky.  IIRC it didn't allow actual freelook, only to switch between the POV of other entities/players in the demo, which is also a bit disappointing.  There is also a pretty big catch, since T2 demos only record what's ""neccessary"" for the player to know. Not only does this mean stuff that's ""far away"" won't get recorded, the stuff that is recorded follows some form of priority list in terms of how often their gamestate is updated (in descending order of importance; not sure how accurate this is, but you get the idea)   the recording player players very close to the recording player flag carriers the rest of your own teammates enemies near your own teammates the rest of the enemy team   Which is to say, it's pretty useless if you want to know what happens on the other side of the map or if you want an enemy's POV except in the cases they were right up the face of the recording player."

Tribes,2nrf4q,Nark51,0,Sat Nov 29 19:28:09 2014 UTC,"Calling it plagiarism is really stupid. A metric shitton of games reference real life weapons with made-up names and stuff, and then they're homages or just designs that the devs liked enough to put into their games.  But when it's HiRez - it immediately becomes plagiarism. Give them a break, I'm no fan of HiRez but at least recognize when to criticize something worth criticizing. Basing a weapon in their game's design over a cool futuristic looking gun did zero harm to the game or their company image, the weapon's functionality on the other hand might be a different story.  Remember you can't just lump the art guys in with the guys who programmed the game to make it fucking shit. The art guys at HiRez did a really good job for the most part, there's only a handful of things I can think of rightly faulting them for, such as Temple Ruins' textures mixing together with Blood Eagle armours and HUD indicators which makes shit hard to see."

Tribes,2njoc8,Zwitterions,10,Thu Nov 27 03:55:25 2014 UTC,"Just want to say thanks to the T:A community members that have been a part of my time with Tribes in the last 2 years.    To the guys that always leave positive or helpful feedback on my videos, my YT subscribers, and friends: I just want to say thanks to you especially.  I remember first learning to play the original Counter-Strike competitively back in the day and just wishing that one day I'd be good enough to make montages like the ones I'd seen online.  While I may not have had that success with CS, I found it in an even better game series and it's seriously thanks to you guys so believe when I say you fucking rock!  To the competitive community, I just want to say it was one hell of a ride.  There were a lot of bumps in the road along the way but I feel like T:A got as good of a life as it deserved.  Thank you for helping to keep this game alive as long as you did.  Finally, I just want to say this isn't the end of me and Tribes or anything.  I will keep posting things to my YT and occasionally I will share those links in this subreddit but there will not be any more montages.  They are too time consuming and the audience that enjoys them is dwindling (and I no longer have the time to get top clips like I used to).   I will pop in for PUGs every once in a blue moon or so and I'm sure I'll always be active on this subreddit.  For now, however, I will say GGs everyone <3."

Tribes,2njoc8,PowerTattie,2,Thu Nov 27 04:09:24 2014 UTC,"Thx homie!  Honestly, I wish I could have subbed some of the clips out but I have played probably less than 10 pugs since this semester started so I had to look through some old ass pugs for clips (hence why you'll occasionally see some old names, 720p 30fps clips).  And dat nords aim wasn't noodle I am ADAD masta.  I actually have a lot of clips saved where I ADAD good players without taking a hit but I never use them usually because they're boring and it just looks like the other player has bad aim rather than it being a product of good movement.  I used the nords one because I survived long enough to mid-air an incoming capper."

Fast forward to better connections and the sad truth that I played it for 10+ years, and the delay reduces with a better ping.  I went from 160 ping to 60, and it was such a drastic difference that you need to re-learn how to aim.  Its a main reason why light defense players had low ping, and high ping players typically stuck to heavy offense or farming"

Tribes,2n8sqa,fireboat,9,Tue Nov 25 02:14:33 2014 UTC,Isn't every 1v1 tourney just going to end with Implaus and Mopsy? We have some amazingly interesting (and fun to watch?) Arena sessions with 6v6. I'm trying to come up with a way you could sift player brackets with wins and losses until you ended up with a nail-biter of a team versus team match.
Tribes,2n8sqa,KindaGamey,1 point,Mon Nov 24 17:46:19 2014 UTC,"Well, this encourages people to get better. In my opinion, playing against the best of the best brings the most improvement."
Tribes,2n8sqa,Kirotera12,1 point,Mon Nov 24 18:35:12 2014 UTC,"The real point of this first tournament was to give players a reason to become more involved either for the first time or as they once were. Something to aspire to and motivation to hone their abilities, I want people to want to be better because it will make for a more active and fiercely skilled community.  Just assuming it will always be Mopsy and Implausibility in the end sets a player up for defeat from the start.  As for your tournament format suggestion , we've thrown the idea around a bit of a possible ladder style 2v2 event. I do appreciate your oppinion about having something involving teamplay though, which could stand to increase the skill ceiling and gameplay dynamics even further."

Maybe for next tournament allow perks but locked to one - capacitor+ quick draw.

Tribes,2n5qkm,MagusUnion,3,Tue Nov 25 11:23:40 2014 UTC,"Region is a factor, but it seems most regions have some server issues with some gameplay influence. In Euro we've got some server warps of significant magnitude, but not game breaking. Like a one second warp every minute or so, so it happens like once a game that it decides an important moment, but it rarely determines the outcome of the game (and it's certainly not a bigger factor than, say, strikes).  As for number of players, in Euro we usually have a single server going during most hours except (early) morning (4-10 on weekdays) and get a couple of server-fulls of players at peak hours. PUBs and PUGs are the same as always, with PUBs being full of players that are bad in various ways and rarely with any coordination whatsoever, but it still happens that people accidentally set up a decent game. PUGs have their usual issues and glories and there are usually a few sets every evening.  Really, nothing has really changed all that much in the past year, apart from a couple of instances of HiRez bullshit. We're still in a stagnant state at a slow decline in everything except average skill level, since the comp players seem to stick around longer than most people."

Tribes,2mq4l0,mizzu704,2,Wed Nov 19 11:00:03 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I asked."
Tribes,2mq4l0,ArmoredPenguin94,3,Wed Nov 19 11:05:35 2014 UTC,"I've never done it myself (don't even know what the ""shout"" in shoutcasting is supposed to mean), but here are a few things I prefer/appreciate as a viewer or I would think about when starting to do this:   Get a good microphone (e.g. blue yeti tier). If the audio quality is bad, your casting has to be amazing to keep me around. Do your own thing. Don't think you have to obey to any conventions. Surely, it's a good idea to look at good casters (yes, in other games too) and see what they do, but their casting is good because they got it to work, and the odds are that their specific way of talking and so on only works for them as a person/character. If you're the kinda guy who likes to yell Phreeky-style, then feel free to do it and it will probably work. If you aren't, it's just gonna be awkward.  Related to that, do not forget that this is Tribes you're casting and not LoL/Dota/CS. This means that you're providing content for an almost dead game and that getting triple digit viewer numbers would already be a success. While this might seem a bit depressing, it's also a big relief and you don't need to act super professional (doesn't mean you should be a dick to people).  If you'd want me to watch, you would need to understand the game better than the viewers and be able to point out the depth of what is happening, why one team won a certain situation and so on and so on. But that's just my personal taste (I don't like loud casting, I think it's pointless). Silence, comedy and rambling-about-stuff-unrelated-to-the-game is underrated, Seriousness and Play-by-play is way overrated. The only moments in Tribes casts that I can remember were when 1. one player accidentally tried to grenade-jump as a SLD and the casters almost shat themselves 2. Knutsson was way drunk and described the castles in the background of Arx instead of talking about the game happening and 3. when Jimchrist Vir flew a shrike into his own base on X-fire as the casters were talking about how he was the best Shriker in the game. Tribes spec has a first-person-mode (press L), use it. It doesn't have a HUD, a gun model or a crosshair, but it's still better than 3rd-person, that's how bad 3rd-person spec is (which has its place tho). I might post some VODs of good casting later here (none of them in Tribes tho, cause that's not the game I watch)    Edit: There we go. This is all Quake duel (see the example 3 for some explanations about gameplay).    This is a bo5 grand final of a sunday cup between Evil and Cypher (arguably the two best ""active"" players) from last January: Link. The casting is a bit weird in the beginning, but that goes away rather quickly. What I noticed while watching this back in the last hour: Notice how the casters' focus is entirely on the game and they do get quite exited, but only in close matches. The forth map in that series is quite one-sided and then they get more calm (nothing to get exited about) and just generally talk about the game or other things. Consider watching back the whole cup, these two casters are quite good together, mainly because both have something to say about the game. The second example consists off a few hours of footage. It's a spring season finale from last June (season finale = every player who won one of the 8 season sunday cups gets to play, or something like that). Link. The best VOD here is again the Grand Finale between Cypher and Evil. Just very easy on on eyes, ears and mind, but it still makes me exited about the game. Both of the casters know a lot about the game and the players, like what kind of plays or moves are characteristic for each player. And they don't hesitate to talk about little aspects of the game in moments where there's not a lot of action. Some oldschool stuff: QuakeCon 2010 between Cypher and Cooller, just one map. Link. These two guys are more on the hype side of things, but they still give you decent information about what's actually going on, and when it's play-by-play, it's about stuff that matters. Considered the best casters the game ever had by some. More from them. (starts at 24:40, there's also a explanation how the game actually works at 19:45) And some lols There's also this. This is from like Monday or so, and probably comes closest to how I would do the streaming/commentary thing.   Why did I write this down?"
Tribes,2mq4l0,mizzu704,3,Wed Nov 19 15:52:09 2014 UTC,"Some reflections on these points from someone who has done quite a bit of casting:  1) mic. You can make a mid tier mic work (I had a 35€ headset and it was fine), it might require some wizardry tho (ask Aeia or Helemar for more, idk how they did it)  2)  Completely agree. That's actually what I have always told people at the Casting Workshops.   5) Eh, that's preference mainly. Some people prefer the more serious casts others prefer the more relaxed ones. I've heard from both sides. Just do it the way you prefer, OP. Also it wasn't JimChrist. It was Vir.   6) meh, the problem with that (& with solo-casting/camera in general) is that you barely see anything when in first person. I was lucky/had shit internet so I always had someone do camera for me. I never used first person. If you are looking for stuff happening on the map you can't use that. But I agree it has its place. It is a very neat thing to do when the capper is coming in & you watch him go from his POV. Remember that the camera will reset to where it was before you zoomed in his POV if he dies so you'll have to be quick to bring it back in the action.  7) wow, r00d. DocMatrix, Stowie, phr33ky, w1nters, Knutsson & no good casting? why u so mean :("
Tribes,2mq4l0,ArmoredPenguin94,2,Wed Nov 19 16:25:23 2014 UTC,"7) wow, r00d.

Tribes,2mq4l0,angrypolak1,2,Wed Nov 19 19:43:35 2014 UTC,"thanks for the mention man :)  Oh and for those asking in this thread, the term ""shoutcasting"" dates back to the olden days of audio-only streaming, when people used the Shoutcast plugin for Winamp to do their casts. Things have moved more toward the video realm now of course, but the name ""shoutcaster"" stuck around as sort of an honorific. (I actually still use Shoutcast for radio shows haha)"

Tribes,2mq4l0,krokooc,2,Wed Nov 19 10:59:24 2014 UTC,"I think the best casters is the ones that hype the small things, and is aware what is going on. It's hard to cover every little moment, but to be aware where the action is happening and have the right camera work is good. When there is no flagmovement or ""deadtime"" a caster can analyze the strategy of the teams, or the playstyles, even better if caster know the players abit so he can talk about decision making or whatnot. I guess it would be easier to have atleast 1 that are handling the camera so you don't have to focus on both on the same time.  Try to have decent casting ini and also decent streaming quality so you can actually see things on stream. That's what I came up with right now."
Tribes,2mq4l0,Shaeress,1 point,Wed Nov 19 07:55:15 2014 UTC,The hype comes naturally but only the Aus scene have seen that in action during games haha!

Tribes,2mm5kz,Dodgesabre,2,Tue Nov 18 09:00:22 2014 UTC,"At paxAUS I talked to hirezTodd in person about the server issues, he said he didn't even know there was any issues with the tribes servers. I told him to read the servers down thread which was pinned here and that almost all regions except for central were having severe server issues.   He suggested that he was going to see if they could change providers for us aussies since we still had issues even when they came back up, which was from the previous provider change so they could host smite servers here.  I think we have gotten a quite solid upgrade, cannot be bothered to confirm if the providers of the servers have been changed. Even if they do crash, the server starts up extremely quickly :D"
Tribes,2mm5kz,reffee,1 point,Tue Nov 18 11:37:41 2014 UTC,"Ok, that's very strange as I have E-Mailed 3 different guys over there, APC included. So I think they are aware of the issue. About the server providers, I think it was mainly for Smite, as they have brought up AUS servers on Smite, aswell as South Americans servers I belive. So you have quick bootup time on servers, aswell as fast loading times between maps now? But they still crash or?"
Tribes,2mm5kz,Lowerend,1 point,Tue Nov 18 11:52:16 2014 UTC,"Yeah clearly not all the employees are, I also email'd APC when ours originally went down as well so there might be some communication issues inside the company. To be fair they are 100% on smite and a little bit of the new GA right now.   I know they changed providers when smite came up, it was the reason we had that long period without any servers.   This previous drop out could have been due to another change(if Todd actually came through with what he said).  We now have fast bootup times and quick map changes. We only crash in between maps occasionally and even when it does they come back almost instantly. We also no longer have issues where we DC from the server and everyone jumps/warps. The game also feels better(less micro warps on players) but that could also just be my internet deciding it wants to be good today."

And in the very same E-mail I typed about the long loading times and crashes, also about AUS servers where up in server browser, but you guys could't connect to them (same for LON for us now). So offcourse they read it, but how they forward it further is blurry. I do a try om smite reddit I guess, but think it's gonna be downvoted pretty quickly as it is not Smite related."
Tribes,2mm5kz,Luminanc3,1 point,Tue Nov 18 12:47:36 2014 UTC,I was told that they don't even read the tribes reddit anymore so the smite one is probably your best bet unfortunately.

Tribes,2mmxsb,TheFatCupcakes,6,Tue Nov 18 05:05:11 2014 UTC,"My understanding is that this is true, since T:A has more air control. This means that in T:A, the path a player will take through the air is harder to predict and requires the player to sort of fly in just the right direction. Of course, there are situations in which this isn't very noticeable, such as at very close ranges. The motion in T:V is much more...linear due to there being less air control, and so it should be easier to predict the path that your target will fly through.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong; there's probably something I'm missing, as I barely played T:V at all."
Tribes,2mmxsb,Gimmesoup,3,Tue Nov 18 05:42:22 2014 UTC,It might also have to do with the faster disc speed compared to Ascend. That was one of the things I noticed. But at the same time targets travel much farther and faster than in Ascend so what you gain in speed and linearity you end up losing in distance and size of target.
Tribes,2mmxsb,THEM0RNlNGW00D,1 point,Tue Nov 18 05:53:58 2014 UTC,Also the ability to carry 3 or more weapons at the same time that are capable of mid-airing.

Tribes,2mmxsb,THEM0RNlNGW00D,1 point,Wed Nov 19 03:03:08 2014 UTC,"Kinda, inheritance I haven't actually been able to discern completely but it feels a little more than Ascend's 50. But the feeling is very getting similar to blinks and flows better from an intuition standpoint."
Tribes,2mmxsb,ShardBorne,2,Wed Nov 19 14:42:01 2014 UTC,"Yeah, MAs were more forgiving in T:V. However, people could get moving quicker, and fly a bit faster on average, though air-time was much, much more significant (especially with grapple). So not sure which is ""easier"".   Also, there was only one kind of spin in T:V and it wasn't gonna 1 hit kill anyone."
Tribes,2mmxsb,MortRouge,2,Tue Nov 18 06:57:52 2014 UTC,"Well, in T:V you never really go for groundshots, you learn to midair or die. With the grappling hook, you can pretty much stay in the air all the time if you have a high enough building near you."
Tribes,2mmxsb,HighDiveTV,2,Tue Nov 18 20:25:05 2014 UTC,"TL;DR: Neither of the two is more difficult, they simple feel completely different.  Even though popular belief and intuition state otherwise, I dare say NO. Note that I only have a mere 100ish hours of T:A on my record, while I have played T:V several thousands of hours (yeah that's pretty sad but that's another topic =)). I'll try sum up the pro and contra arguments I can think of and make a final conclusion when I run out of inspiration.  First of, are the weapons. In T:A you got multiple spinfusors, whereas in T:V you only got one. This can make that you get more accustomed with the T:V spinfusor as you are using that one way more often than any of the T:A spinfusors (given that you actually use them all of course...). That votes in favor of T:V being easier. I have read that T:V would have more weapons to midair with, but I dare declare that assumption false, as T:A also has multiple weapons (if not more than T:V has) to midair your opponent with. Lets call this in slight favor of T:V being easier to midair.  Secondly, we got the disc speed and its inheritance. In Tribes Vengeance the disc speed is significantly higher than in Ascend. The disc inheritance in T:V is set to 50%, whereas in T:A I have no clue to be honest: I have witnessed both 0%, 100% as several values in between --> I lost track. I have always thought the spinfusor felt better in Vengeance than in Ascend. It's hard to put my finger on why that is, but I assume inheritance plays an important role here. Now to come back to the disc speed. The disc speed in Vengeance is indeed way higher, but that is because we could simply OUTRUN the discs easily whenever we hit speeds around 250 - 300 or even higher. That makes it was literally impossible to midair someone with a spinfusor, meaning you had to result to sniping or chaingunning. As most likely everyone will agree, the spinfusor is pretty much the iconic weapon of Tribes and for most the most enjoyable, so we increased the disc speed (to keep it a viable option). I haven't tried out Ascend to verify the following statement, but I from what I have seen from several movies the time it takes to hit someone midair is somewhat the same between both games: going from <1 second to a maximum of about 4 to 6 seconds (= max in Vengeance at this particular moment). Therefore I declare this point to be neutral.  Thirdly, we got the gaming phase. Last time I have turned on T:A was shortly after the beta and I had always felt that the phase in Ascend was significantly slower than in Vengeance. This is also partly because of the fact Vengeance had been pretty much mastered by the time Ascend came out, whereas people (me included) were still learning Ascend. Now what does this mean? It simply means you have to lead your projectile further ahead of the target in Vengeance than in Ascend, making it more difficult. Disc speed factor got covered above (it partly counters this point). The grappler plays a very significant role in this high speed game. Many people did and still do believe this is a ground breaking addition to the game, while in fact it is simply yet another threshold added to an already very difficult game: not only do you need to learn the fundamentals of Tribes and learn to understand how people move, you also have to get accustomed with and learn to predict the ""random"" movements of the target you are trying to hit. People with many hours of T:V on their sleeve or much insights, will be able to verify the fact that over time these ""random"" movements can also be predicted in 90% (if not more) of the cases, leading to a mere increase in game velocity rather than an impossible chasing target. But enough off topic stories, back to topic. As most of you will know, the grappler is used mainly for getting high initial speeds and changing direction. Because you can literally go from 0 to 180 in a mere 2 to 3 seconds, the gaming phase is significantly higher in Vengeance than in Ascend. As stated already, this means you have to lead further ahead of the target, meaning it is (slightly) more difficult to midair in vengeance than in Ascend.  Fourthly, airtime. I have noticed, however, that is has proven to be quite difficult (if not impossible) to get the same amount of ""air time"" in Ascend as in Vengeance. This is not only because of the Grappler that is available for use in T:V, but mostly because of the way the maps are made: T:A has been flattened out in an attempt to lower the speed of the game, to lower the threshold for the new Tribals. Whereas it is easy to follow where this idea came from, it has been (from what I have seen and witnessed) implemented horribly, causing it to feel horrible. On the old T:A forums I have once seen a nice graph illustrating this perfectly: T1 and T2 had big mountains, T:V had hills, whereas T:A was flat, obviously in comparison to each other. In Vengeance you will be able to go so high you can't see the map anymore pretty easily, whereas I haven't seen it once in Ascend yet. Books can be filled with this subject, but to keep on topic: I feel the air time in T:V is higher, meaning the target spends more of his time in air, increasing the risk of him getting midaired. Does this mean it is EASIER to midair in Vengeance? No. You simply have more time and thus more chances to midair, and thus you will eventually hit more midairs.   Fifthly, the air control. Many say that in T:A you have more air control than in Vengeance. Personally speaking, I have no idea where this comes from. I remember that I was facing speed limits and ""overdrive"" (or something like that) limitations so that I could only move forwards and backwards until I had slowed down enough. This literally meant I couldn't do shit (= going left or right, up or down) until I had slowed down enough. This made me feel pretty helpless at times. In Tribes Vengeance it also gets increasingly difficult to move sideways at high velocity, but you still got very much control over where you're heading towards. This is one of the things the developers of Tribes Vengeance changed in comparison to Tribes 2 (besides adding the grappler, making maps smaller and less high), to make the game more forgiving and easy to learn for new people. This also means it is very easy for the target to dodge incoming projectiles, especially since he has ample time to see the projectile heading his way. Furthermore, the player in Vengeance can change trajectory at any given time in almost any circumstance (this can proof disastrous for attempts to hit at long range, trust me ;P). I sincerely hope that retarded speed cap and overdrive thing have been removed, so I go put this argument at a neutral for our discussion.  Going to number six, we got the hitbox. To be pretty blunt, I have always thought and still think the hitbox in Ascend is a fucked up piece of shit. One time you see discs passing through the body, the other time it explodes 5m besides the target. I have heard the hitboxes were expanded a little bit so it got easier for people to land midairs, but meanwhile this gives a pretty fucked up feeling, if you ask me. In Tribes Vengeance the hitboxes are quite accurate to the player, besides for the fact that you have to aim slightly in front of the player to actually hit (Binswees loves to elaborate on this, so I will leave the honor to him should there be any questions), because of interpolation time client <-> server. This is especially noticeable on very high speeds: >300. Given this, I dare say it's slightly easier to hit in Vengeance than in Ascend.  CONCLUSION TIME! In my opinion, the spinfusor and other weapons simply feel more natural in Vengeance than in Ascend. They make more sense and feel better which makes you get more easily accustomed to them (+1 for Vengeance). The hitboxes make way more sense than they do in Ascend (+1 for Vengeance). However, In Tribes Vengeance you are playing at a higher phase (of course, given you have mastered the basics, else its pretty damn fucked up difficult ...) then in Ascend (+1 for Ascend). Also, in Tribes Ascend you have less air time, spending more time close to the ground, being vulnerable for close range air shots (+1 for Ascend). Therefore I dare state, neither of the two is ""easier"", it simply FEELS completely different, due to described reasons."

Tribes,2mkhkw,angrypolak1,1 point,Mon Nov 17 16:54:03 2014 UTC,"It's not, I know the nova colt's fire rate is snail speed with a ping > 70, but the match made me realise how strong the inject actually is. Also, gaem is super ded after this season imo."
Tribes,2mkhkw,angrypolak1,2,Mon Nov 17 17:01:08 2014 UTC,"i guess its strong but brute is just bad at playing ctf, ur fat and have limited mobility.  I would rather choose the euros low pings and be able to chain and play the game without the flag going through you half the time. inb4, your playing in another region so you deserve high ping even doe eu is only comp left to play"
Tribes,2mkhkw,Dodgesabre,1 point,Mon Nov 17 17:38:12 2014 UTC,"I agree with the low ping point, but I don't quite agree with the ""brute is bad @ ctf"" point. Brute roam is like a second HoF and incredibly annoying and hard to break as offense, maybe even harder than medium roam & HoF. Not to mention the offense dying too early and d-ing up even further, but that's a whole other point."
Tribes,2mkhkw,Lowerend,1 point,Mon Nov 17 18:01:14 2014 UTC,"Brute roam is easy to counter, your O just does mini routes and grabs when they aren't looking.

Tribes,2mjfww,ShilaSing,6,Mon Nov 17 06:56:23 2014 UTC,"Tv screens are pretty awful for gaming from what I know. Casual gamers won't notice but there's a severe response time and input lag. Refresh rate might also be lower than desired. I don't know much about the topic but I would avoid tv's at all cost.   Ping isn't too bad, I don't notice a difference on the 15 ping servers and the 100ish ping servers. I only struggle with fps issues due to my very old hardware. I believe ping will mostly affect chain and some hitscan more than others.   I'd wait for a vet to weigh in on the subject."

FPS issues, probably, take priority though.  To OP: The new LCD/LED TVs are going to do very poorly in ghosting and response time. Highly recommend you get a monitor, or a CRT TV if you must.  edit: my grammar was abysmal this morning sorry guys"

Connecting through HDMI even and it was just BAD.  Frame rate was flawless though, but the time between what should have been displaying and what I was looking at in real time was off by a good half second. Didn't matter if the TV was primary monitor or secondary it was always somewhere between a half and full second slow to display what was currently happening."
Tribes,2mjfww,prettzl,1 point,Mon Nov 17 10:00:32 2014 UTC,"id be tempted to say that maybe your 32"" screen dropped the refresh rate somewhere closer to tv hd standard, probably 30 or 24hz. even at 50 hz this game is painful to play because of input lag.  edit poor grammar."
Tribes,2mjfww,psyfy1980,1 point,Mon Nov 17 10:41:00 2014 UTC,TVs have basically a mini-computer in them that transcodes the data it's receiving into a picture. This often comes with a significant input delay. That's the sluggishness you're feeling. There isn't really anything you can do about it.
