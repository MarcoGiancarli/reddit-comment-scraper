MaterialDesign,3e317g,emanguy,2,Wed Jul 22 04:07:12 2015 UTC,"Yup, was going to comment on the same thing.  Material design focuses on ""motion with meaning."" So, when you have an animation like this, it makes more sense to the user to have the animation start from where there finger left off, to show context: by swiping up, they launched the app.   When it originates from the side like this, it creates a bit of confusion, since it appears to just be coming from nowhere, and has no relation to the action they just performed."
MaterialDesign,3e317g,caseyls,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:32:07 2015 UTC,The orange circle should expand from the bottom of the screen instead of the left side  See: point of origin  https://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/responsive-interaction.html#responsive-interaction-material-response

And using lists instead of grids for artists and album would be so much more intuitive. Also the now playing bar without the ridiculous shadow is neat.  It's great!"

MaterialDesign,3dsdv5,Gone24,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:56:21 2015 UTC,I appreciate your critique and will consider it when next designing a music app. Thanks! üëç
MaterialDesign,3dsdv5,machete_Badger,2,Sun Jul 19 07:18:54 2015 UTC,"In now playing the music controls should really be at the very bottom, and the album name and playlist button should be under/combined with the rest of the song info.   As much as I like the contacts-style letters in artists, albums and playlists I'm concerned that the smaller space for names/titles will only make cropping issues worse, especially on smaller phones.   I like the look of the card-style action buttons in the song list, however I think it's the wrong way to go. Clicking a song shouldn't turn it into a card (really a menu) and make me take another action just to hear it, and the drop-down button hides too many important actions to place under a card. (don't dare make the card action buttons scrollable, don't even do it)  I really like the artist/album view though. I like how it currently fuses them and blurs the line between mine and theirs, but I think your method is more functional and understandable. Bravo.   Overall I really like it. I have some concerns, but even with those I see it as a marked improvement to the existing app.  Edit: The more I think about it, I understand where you're coming from with the song items turning into cards, but I wouldn't want albums or artists to do that, and I would want consistency. I think maybe a long press (maybe opening a popup) to access those items would be better.  Also, I would miss the thumbnail heavy album art view. It would be nice to be able to switch back to it, Google Docs style."
MaterialDesign,3dsdv5,herrschr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:40:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment. To start, I have gathered some inspirations here and there and the general placement of the play / skip controls have been towards the 3/4 quarter of the player. I acknowledge everyone has preferences and I understand how you would feel you would prefer the buttons along the very bottom. I wish apps let us choice, but that's just the way it is, isnt it?  Regarding the cropped space for artists and albums, they were already limited for space, which doesn't justify my decision, but I will say that I made that design choice because I wanted it to be in line with the other Google apps, along the terms of lists and tabs.  In terms of the songs expanding into cards, I have made this choice because of the amount of times my playing queue has been reset due to a mis-click of a song, and I know we've all done it, so I feel this could be a good solution. The overflow button would then show options such as 'Go to artist' and 'Buy'. I got this inspiration from the dialer app. And also, I don't want the artist or albums to expand either. I don't think anything too bad would happen if you mis-clicked and album or artist lool.  I'm glad you generally enjoy my design and I always appreciate the feedback, it helps me be even more considerate of users needs and preferences when trying to design an intuitive app."

It's something I've struggled with finding a balance in trying to use material design for mainly desktop purposes. Yes I know it was made to be multi platform, but most of the examples already made for GMD on desktop views is through google products like docs, drive, sheets, music... etc. Basically everything is in a giant card (like this subreddit style) or in tiny cards.   In UX the point of a card is to group information that is relevant to each other. Sometimes it looks nice/functions well to have all of the info in one giant card for desktop and other times it really doesn't work at all. Take a look at Google's I/O page. They use banding and the card style. The banding works here because it's a social event so they have lots of photos but if this style was used for a network or service it would be difficult to use because what photos would I use, haha?   Though... Invision App utilizes a lot of material design components and I think they do a pretty good job of it. It's desktop based.

If not, like i said above, I'm not going to limit functionality/navigation for the sake of minimalism. If material design can't accommodate it's time for it to expand.  Down vote this if you simply can't think of a solution /r/materialdesign."

Normally, I wouldn't dedicate a FAB for Now Playing, but seeing as how it expands (only if you know what you're doing) into some nifty shortcuts, it isn't all that bad.   However, any good UX guy's principle for a simple app should be 'no tutorials', and I'm not sure how that'd work out over here."

The other option is the default windows email app. Not sure if you use windows or not but it is quite nice, at least on Windows 10, 8 might be good too but I only have Windows 7 and 10. It is well designed and functional, at least in my opinion, and if you don't have 10 but you do have Windows it's not too far off. The design isn't exactly material since it is Windows but it is somewhat similar (it doesn't have quite the animations and overall feel to it but just looking at it it is not very far off and quite nice).

MaterialDesign,3culxb,Dumtiedum,2,Fri Jul 10 22:56:55 2015 UTC,You can add inbox/gmail as a chrome extension and you could just start the extension with a click from you start menu. Only tested this with gmail

MaterialDesign,3cannb,tnsittpsif,4,Mon Jul 6 16:34:07 2015 UTC,"That's true! I am a beginner myself, but i have never used Ubuntu myself because i wanted something new, which was command line for me. I wanted to get rid of that easy-to-go GUI and learn something new. Now command line is totally possible in Ubuntu, but it's kinda more directed towards making Linux easy to use, hence removing the hurdles one wpuld have to face for a deep learning experience.  So, the reason i suggested Ubuntu, was that not all people are looking for such a deep learning experience from the start itself. Some prefer it slow and smooth.  :)"

Just make the sandwich menu button flip into an arrow when pulled from the right (I know you can barely see it when opening the menu but still)  Also is it possible to sync it with your Google account to save the reminders? And have notifications for them in the status bar?
MaterialDesign,3bt01k,theyuryh,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:08:14 2015 UTC,"I'll look into the button flip soon :)   And in terms of the Google account and sync that's something I'd love to do, but I was planning on moving on from this app; it was something which I started to learn about Android dev, but I planned it to fix my own personal problem with apps like Google Keep which is that they are slow, cluttered and require you to direct thought away from writing down what you need to remember. If others like the no thought approach and pick up my app then I'll definitely spend some time working on things like sync.    Now for me this app has been nice, I've been using it in the field for the past week when I was on holiday and it works and feels way better than anything I have used before when doing things like noting down points/dates/times of things while continuing a conversation. It would be really cool to know if you have been using the app for this sort of thing or if you're just checking it out to try and help me out?"
MaterialDesign,3bt01k,theyuryh,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:10:05 2015 UTC,"I usually use Google Keep for my more intense note taking but ""Remember me"" is very nice just to jot something quick down, especially if it's gonna be something you need to look at the same day (:  So I guess I'm doing both?

You can have the ratings shown somewhere in the header and tapping the ratings opens the details. Same with the phone numbers, but in the list view (on top of the northbound/southbound entries; tapping a number opens the dialer). Then you are left with deals, prices and book rooms as buttons, similar to Google Maps.    As a bonus, users are already familiar with this layout because of Maps.    Edit: Just an addition, it looks to me as if the icons on the left side of each list item are to big. They should have a size of 24dp. Also the FAB should have a shadow. You could either add a little gradient from 25-50% black to transparent on top of the bottom of the picture to make the white text more legible or move the text into the header as well, like in Google maps."

On a 72ppi screen, 1dp will display as 0,45 pixels. (72√∑160). At 326ppi, you need 2,0375 pixels to fill 1dp.  If you have more questions go ahead.  Edit: got it wrong."
MaterialDesign,3b36kb,DaveBowman,3,Thu Jun 25 18:13:28 2015 UTC,"I think this can be answered in a more easy way. In my case design at 360x640 because when i preview it in my phone i just scale it to 3x and fits perfectly. So when i work at 1x (360x640) i know that 1dpi it's 1px. Because when a phone tells you that the screen resolution is 1080x1920 it's a lie, in reality it's 360x640 scaled 3 times."

MaterialDesign,3b36kb,_IAlwaysLie,2,Fri Jun 26 04:15:16 2015 UTC,"Basically, it is like this:    there are distinct density buckets.     mdpi = 160dpi hdpi = 240dpi xhdpi = 320dpi xxhdpi = 480dpi xxxhdpi = 640dpi.   These are all currend density buckets (ok, there is also ldpi, but who cares). Devices are placed into one bucked depending on what it's actual screen density is closest to. 1dp is defined as 1px (pixel) at 160dpi. So at mdpi, a 48dp icon is 48px wide and tall.    This are all scaling factors (factor = target dpi/160):     mdpi: 1 dp = 1 px --> 24dp icon = 24px, 48dp icon = 48px hdpi: 1 dp = 1.5 px --> 24dp icon = 36px, 48dp icon = 72px xhdpi: 1 dp = 2 px --> 24dp icon = 48px, 48dp icon = 96px xxhdpi: 1 dp = 3 px --> 24dp icon = 72px, 48dp icon = 144px xxxhdpi: 1 dp = 4 px --> 24dp icon = 96px, 48dp icon = 192px   So when you want to create a grid, decide for one density bucket to calculate from dp to px (I suggest xhdpi or xxhdpi, because most flagships should be in either), and chose a screen resolution (like 1920x1080)."

I mean, after all, a piece of paper on your screen is not identical to a piece of paper on a desk -- so why should it act similarly? The beauty about screens and such is that they're not real and don't have to behave like real physical objects. You can make them act any way you wish exactly because they're not real physical objects.   I think the best feature about Material Design is not its principals, but its standardization. It has brought a standard across all of Google's designs, which is more beneficial to a general user than shadows and movement."

Frequently download apps that people say are great, and occasionally, ones that people say aren't. More importantly, form your own critique on them. Visit places like Dribbble to get a good idea the idea that an app can look flippin' gorgeous and still be a usability wreck.   After that, graduate to creating your own wireframes. Work out what YOU think you want to get out of material design.   App design is a very subjective thing, and especially with having such well-established guidelines, apps have started looking rather stale and boring, despite all the great colors and animations.   Use the guidelines to make it look not jarring. But do your best to imprint your portfolio with your own sense of aesthetics and identity.  That's how dad did it, that's how America did it... And it's worked out pretty well so far."

I just tried Sync and from what I could tell the biggest differences are just that Sync looks more cluttered but also displays fewer posts onscreen at a time, and it lacks a lot of the smooth animations Relay has. Besides that their UI is relatively similar. To me it seems like Relay uses motion and the rest of the resources of material design to create a pretty fluid, intuitive interface."

I can't be the only one thinking how misplaced the counter looks. It's right at the very top, whereas surely the focal point should be at least close to the center. You might also want to add some nice little details/colors/fancies to spruce that page up, in order to make it feel like a nice screen to look at.

Maybe have a look at different clock and expense apps, what they do to make counters more interesting. You could make it look like Google clock with a ring around it showing how far into a day one is or maybe how far from having a new longest streak one is (compared to previous streaks). You could add personal statistics and diagrams on the average length of a streak, most dangerous time of day for 'breaking' and so on,  and maybe show additional motivation when the user gets close to his average break time, maybe give an achievement for reaching a new longest streak. If a user is looking at the app for more than 5 minutes (or 2, or whatever, I don't know), he might be trying hard to not fap right now, so maybe show an additional motivational popup or a cat picture after some amount of active time...  Making the app minimal is ok, but minimal doesn't have to mean boring.    Edit: Also the app icon looks very generic and unrelated, together with the name 'NF companion' it took me much longer than it should have to understand what this app is for. Rather use a stop sign or a crossed out hand, maybe."

MaterialDesign,3amc4h,6thSolution,19,Sun Jun 21 17:08:54 2015 UTC,"Hello! I agree that we need more material design widgets in the Play Store -- they are pretty scarce. I can tell you've put a lot of work into your app, and a lot of it is really great, especially the rich feature set.   Unfortunately, I wouldn't say this is material deisign. A larger status bar and an animated hamburger icon do not material design make.  I'm just going to focus more on the main page of the app to show this. First, take a look at the navigation bar. The hamburger icon looks good, and it appears to be the correct size. However, when you look at the location name, the text is too small and there is an icon there, even though that area should only be text. Remove the icon and make the name the correct size and font. Now on the right hand side, you have a set of four tabs. As per material design, that should be its own full-width tab bar, with the proper current tab marker being a bottom border. See this image for reference. You can keep it as icons or switch to text or even use both, but make sure those icons follow the icon guidelines, or just use icons from the material set (like the cloud, or the moon).  Now that the navbar is done, let's take a look at the home page of the app-- the current location's current weather. The image there is a great start, although I'm not sure how it's relevant aside from being a photo of weather? Check out this page for a guide on imagery. Perhaps it should be beautiful pictures of the current area. Either way, ""ensure images are dynamic and context-relevant. Use predictive visuals to substantially improve the user experience."" But more important than the image itself is the text on it. Here is an example of text being shown on an image. Note that the text does not have a shadow, instead it is backed by a gradient, and there is only one piece of text on the image. Note also that the image goes behind a transparent navigation bar. So I would make that image you have shorter, remove everything but the temperature (the current time is unnecessary considering the system clock), move the temp,, and scrim it with a gradient. Then you could make the current navigation bar transparent, and make a colored section below the image with the ""Feels Like"" temp. You may have to play with a couple of different layouts.    I could keep going farther down the page, but this comment is getting way too long. Let me know if you have any specific questions.  Here is a quick mockup I threw together, just to show how you might lay it out: http://i.imgur.com/BVxvKuL.png?1."

MaterialDesign,3adz5r,IanSan5653,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:08:20 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot but could you elaborate on why remove the icon background colors? Gmail uses them and in the case of AlarmPad you can actually click on it to change color/icon and those are used on system notifications.
MaterialDesign,3adz5r,NikoTheDroid,3,Fri Jun 19 21:23:50 2015 UTC,They take too much space and make the cards look cluttered. The cards need more whitespace.
MaterialDesign,3adz5r,IanSan5653,3,Fri Jun 19 21:25:46 2015 UTC,"Sure! Great job so far, most of the app looks great!  The biggest problem is the navigation drawer. That needs to be totally overhauled, from the account switcher down. This is an OS standard that doesn't need or allow much flexibility, so stick with the standard.   The main screen looks good--I like the image on top. I would make the FAB persistent though, because it is the primary function of your app and there is no reason to hide it.  On the alarm creation screen, the very top section with the date and time could use a little tweaking; it just doesn't seem to fit. The label form on the second section should have a colored heading. You might want to move the DONE button to a FAB.  The Alarms screen seems a little cluttered, but that may be the only way to display the information. Other than that it looks good.  If I go to Manage Extensions from the navigation drawer, that page is very non-material. Consider replacing it with a colorful illustration that has a purple background to match the bar.  Finally, on the about page, I'm not sure why the Google+ button is sticky rather than scrolling.  Keep up the great work!"
MaterialDesign,3adz5r,IanSan5653,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:00:12 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot! That's great and I agree with everything you said. Do you have any suggestion on how to improve the date/time box when adding a new alarm? I'm not sure how to improve it at the moment. Thanks again!
MaterialDesign,3adz5r,rob3110,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:28:16 2015 UTC,"What if you did a large action bar with the time in lightweight, large font, and then the date in smaller bold capitals below it? Like a variation of this, but without labels and less padding."
MaterialDesign,3adz5r,IanSan5653,3,Fri Jun 19 22:16:47 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit late, but I have some suggestions as well.    Generally, the app looks really nice, I love the design. But I don't like the 'set an alarm' screen. It looks complicated and off.    I made some mock-ups. As /u/IanSan5653 said, you could put the time and day in the app bar. I took inspiration from here.    I would ditch the cards and the 'show more options' button and use an expandable list instead, because currently the screen is overloaded with to many options at the same time.    Each option can be expanded and reduced individually by clicking the subheader. When scrolling, the current subheader should stick to the top, rise in elevation and get a shadow, while the rest of the list scrolls beneath it (check Google Drive) until the next option (subheader) is at the top of the screen.    I re-grouped some options to reduce clutter.    I also reduced the amount of icons visible. Having a padlock, a check mark and a settings icon in some cases seems to much to (also the settings icons are very hard to press). I decided to move the padlock at the place where the check box would be to indicate the option can't be used. Tapping the padlock could extend the list and show the additional text with 'LEARN MORE' and 'BUY'. The settings popup for each option would appear when tapping the check mark, from un-selected to selected, so that the user can chose the option of his choice immediately after activating the feature. Instead of having 'BACK' and 'OK' on the settings popup, there would be 'CANCEL' and 'OK' to show that hitting cancel would also un-check the check mark.    I made the titles more consistent regarding the use of color and icons (so far, some options had headers, some not, some headers were colorful, some had an icon, others not).    I made the options for repeating the alarm permanent because I consider it very important, whereas most other settings might only be changed sometimes but more often saved and reused. The 'remember settings' option is also permanent on the bottom to show the user, whether he had checked it before and that previous settings are already applied.    I kept the 'DONE' action in the app bar, because a FAB would cover important check-marks, and when the FAB hides through scrolling down, the user would have to scroll up first to show the FAB again to set the alarm, which I think would be annoying. The done-action in the app bar is permanently visible and accessible.    Other notes:    On the main alarm screen, the FAB seems to be to 'high' to me. I think it should be 16dp from both the edge and the bottom of the screen.    The navigation drawer looks rather wrong. Check here how it is supposed to look like.    Edit: On my Play Store page (German) are still old screenshots visible (from the glorious days of HoloYolo). I first thought the actual app looks like this.    I hope my input is helpful.    Edit: Many thanks for the gold (my first)! I just realized today (8 days later?). Apparently there is no notification for being gilded. I really appreciate it!"
MaterialDesign,3adz5r,rob3110,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:24:13 2015 UTC,What program do you use to make these?
MaterialDesign,3adz5r,IanSan5653,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:50:07 2015 UTC,"Photoshop. Over the time I put together several templates for various elements (app bar, tabs, lists, cards, menus...), which I can copy, arrange and modify fairly quickly. It was also great because while making those I had to check the guidelines many times for references and it helped me understand Material Design better. If you don't want to make those yourself, here is a collection of many resources. The link was posted here some time ago."
MaterialDesign,3adz5r,rob3110,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:55:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I don't have Photoshop, but I can probably get these to work in gimp. I know exactly what you mean about the guides; I've done the same thing with my web development."
MaterialDesign,3adz5r,rob3110,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:01:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, most of the things should work in gimp as well.

The rest is just a whole lot of organized layers, to keep it as flexible as possible."
MaterialDesign,3adz5r,tapetkabinett,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:10:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot! That's wonderful feedback. I'm already (slowly) working on updating the app based on what you and others said here.  A few things to comment:   I avoid the ""at"" because that's difficult to translate in other languages. That's why currently I have this vertical line between the date and time. A comma could work as well, I guess. I'm not sure I should collapse all options. The label, for example, is something I think the users would want to click straight away. Adding the ""collapsing"" introduces an extra tap to the UI. The reason for the ""more options"" was to hide away the impression of a complicated app. When you list all the collapsed options, I think the app can become more overwhelming. What do you think, instead, of a '+' fab button where the user can select from a list of options to add to the alarm? This way I can have a smaller set of ""default"" options and the user can always tap the fab to add more options if he/she wants to. The ""ringtone"" option card was the most inconsistent one because you could actually tap on the header to select different types of ringtones. It's something I don't like at the moment because it becomes hidden. I think you didn't see it either because you didn't include it in your mock-ups.   Thanks again for the help! I really appreciate it."
MaterialDesign,3adz5r,busride,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:20:32 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I can help.     That's unfortunate with the 'at', because I really like the layout with it. A comma might work as well. You could also keep the 'at' (or similar) in languages where it works, and use a comma in others (all languages I know/use have something like the 'at').   Regarding the additional options, I understand the conflict. I personally don't like to hide options behind a FAB or a 'more' button, because users tend to forget that those exist or are to lazy to hit the button to see what is there. The collapsed list lets the user at least see the headlines without cluttering with detail. If you want the label to be permanent, you could have it as a permanent text field, like the repeat option above. Maybe like this?. You could expand all 'one-line' options (sunrise mode, extensions?). So you only have 'large options' collapsed.   see 2.   With the ringtone option, I had a hard time tapping the header and not the list item below, the touch targets are far to close/tiny, similar to the settings icons and check boxes in some of your options. I saw it, but I really disliked it. Why not use a scrollable dialog like this with either 'app ringtone', 'music', random song' on top and all phone ringtones on the bottom (everything scrolls), or the options 'app ringtone', 'music' and 'random song' are fixed on top and ringtone list scrolls below (like this). Sorry, I forgot to mention this in my previous post but I thought about it."
MaterialDesign,3adz5r,frankxanders,2,Thu Jun 25 13:52:33 2015 UTC,"The only thing I can see is the ""AlarmPad"" text that appears when you scroll down and the alpha of the navigation bar changes.

MaterialDesign,3acwsa,rob3110,2,Fri Jun 19 03:15:59 2015 UTC,"Basically, it is like this: * mdpi = 160dpi * hdpi = 240dpi * xhdpi = 320dpi * xxhdpi = 480dpi * xxxhdpi = 640dpi.    These are all currend density buckets (ok, there is also ldpi, but who cares). Devices are placed into one bucked depending on what it's actual screen density is closest to. 1dp is defined as 1px (pixel) at 160dpi. So at mdpi, a 48dp icon is 48px wide and tall. This are all scaling factors (factor = target dpi/160): * mdpi: 1 dp = 1 px --> 24dp icon = 24px, 48dp icon = 48px * hdpi: 1 dp = 1.5 px --> 24dp icon = 36px, 48dp icon = 72px * xhdpi: 1 dp = 2 px --> 24dp icon = 48px, 48dp icon = 96px * xxhdpi: 1 dp = 3 px --> 24dp icon = 72px, 48dp icon = 144px * xxxhdpi: 1 dp = 4 px --> 24dp icon = 96px, 48dp icon = 192px    I think app icons are 48dp, so to provide icons for all density buckets, you have to scale them from 48px up to 192px. Note: xxxhdpi is currently not used by any device. Google advises to provide the app icon in xxxhdpi though, because some launchers allow to scale icons."

Like, 'friend_request_black_48dp.png' is 192*192 pixels in Photoshop for xxxhdpi. Now if I were to scale it for xxhdpi/xhdpi/hdpi/mdpi , what would the dimensions be in PS? By what factor do you scale them. And how do you know that 192*192px in Photoshop is 48dp in xxxhdpi?"
MaterialDesign,3a9gqb,rob3110,2,Fri Jun 19 07:33:54 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see. First of all, here are the friend request icons in 24dp for all density buckets.    Basically, it is like this: *    mdpi = 160dpi *    hdpi = 240dpi *    xhdpi = 320dpi *    xxhdpi = 480dpi *    xxxhdpi = 640dpi.    These are all currend density buckets (ok, there is also ldpi, but who cares). Devices are placed into one bucked depending on what it's actual screen density is closest to. 1dp is defined as 1px (pixel) at 160dpi. So at mdpi, a 24dp icon is 24px wide and tall. This are all scaling factors (factor = target dpi/160): *    mdpi:    1 dp = 1 px --> 24dp icon = 24px, 48dp icon = 48px *    hdpi:    1 dp = 1.5 px --> 24dp icon = 36px, 48dp icon = 72px *    xhdpi:   1 dp = 2 px --> 24dp icon = 48px, 48dp icon = 96px *    xxhdpi:  1 dp = 3 px --> 24dp icon = 72px, 48dp icon = 144px *    xxxhdpi: 1 dp = 4 px --> 24dp icon = 96px, 48dp icon = 192px    Most icons are used in 24dp, that's why this row is the most important.    Edit: formatting is seriously broken in this sub..."

MaterialDesign,3a5dyb,simplewatermelon,27,Wed Jun 17 10:43:56 2015 UTC,"No, this actually doesn't seem to fit the idea behind material very well.  Material isn't all about FABs and animations that don't have any purpose. It's rather about creating a structure that is clear and easy to understand in order to make things as fast and easy for the user.  This homescreen almost always provides for two taps (as opposed to one) for starting any action/app. The weather widget is a whole other thing...that's simply waste of space and is not glanceable at all."

See here under content block types.    The status bar should be on top of the nav drawer, but this might just be an error in your mock-up.    Instead of having the comic book covers with padding inside the app, you could also make them fit to the borders. I think this looks nicer, but it is a matter of taste.    I also would try a different color for the FAB (and as an accent color generally), because the blue tones are to similar. Maybe try an orange?    I made mock-ups to show what I mean. They show the correct padding between cards and the screen borders, one version without padding around the cover (1), another with the correct padding around the cover (2). (3) shows the correct behavior of the nav drawer, and (4) shows the cards layout in landscape."

After seeing your mockups I really like the idea of comics not having padding, so I'm definitely removing the padding.

Overall, I'd say keep it in the navigation drawer instead of the window itself as it occupies too much space. If you're not showing the logo underneath the toolbar but still wish to display it somewhere visible, then maybe leave it in the toolbar (just make it more compact). The FAB isn't descriptive enough, i.e. doesn't show you which action you can perform with it - substitute the logo with text (ex.: on when orange & off when grey). Although I'm not sure if it's a good idea to use the FAB as a toggle button.   P.S. Sorry for the lack of positive comments here, I'm just better at pointing out things that look off.

Its ok in the action bar, but reconsider it in the other 2-places. If the FAB toggles on/off, try putting an icon there that represents what the action is rather than the logo.  Also, since the FAB isnt a new concept anymore. There's a certain behaviour that people have come to expect of it. That being said, if your 'hero' action is on/off its ok to put it in the FAB, just do a bit of UX testing before releasing it.

Also both the list of people and the overlay of the last 5 songs looks really strange and un-Material like. They don't follow the guidelines at all on how lists/list items should look like and on how stuff being on top of other stuff looks. It would make the friends list be a proper list and make the song list either a popup or expand the list view.    I made some mock-ups and an animation of what I mean. The layout is a little bit unusual, but Google agreed on more creativity with the new branding guide.    mock-us here    animation here    I hope I don't sound to harsh ;)    Edit: I missed the part about the interface turning grey when not broadcasting, this could be added as well, of course."

MaterialDesign,395ehq,stokelton,5,Tue Jun 9 11:19:38 2015 UTC,"Looks nice, but a couple critiques. I would use the FAB as an add package rather than search. Also the sidebar needs to go under the status/notification bar. I also am not a huge fan of the green, but that's a personal preference. Possibly a pro version to change between light and dark and more colors.  Otherwise, it looks really nice. The Play Store is devoid of good Deliveries apps that follow Material Design. Add in cloud support similar to Deliveries Package Tracker and I'd buy it in a second."
MaterialDesign,395ehq,anthonyvardiz,2,Tue Jun 9 13:00:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the pointers! Unfortunately at this moment in time it's for a singular company that only tracks the status off packages not allowing the user to place a new order! Regarding the side bar I will change that thanks for pointing it out, and the green is a standard company color not the best choice!   I just need to learn how to code for android so wish me luck I hope  to have a working demonstration within the coming months!"
MaterialDesign,395ehq,LrdvdrHJ,4,Tue Jun 9 13:28:33 2015 UTC,"I think he meant use the fab to add a new package tracking, rather than place an entirely new order.   Good work by the way, keep it up!"
MaterialDesign,395ehq,rob3110,3,Tue Jun 9 22:13:41 2015 UTC,"Padding of the text in the cards and the individual order page looks to small. While cards should be 8 dp from the borders of the screen (as they are on your design), text should be 16 dp from the borders of the screen and text within cards should be 16 dp from the edges of the cards. Maybe align the text on the right side of the card (the company names) right so that it sits better on the border.    To make the text on the image more readable you could all gradients from transparent black to completely transparent between text and image do reduce image brightness on portions where text and icons are.    Having a back-arrow in the FAB is rather strange, I don't know if this works well or confuses users.    As others said, the cards loo a bit boring, and technically those shouldn't even be cards but lists items, since cards should have at least two different actions, but sometimes cards simply look better, so this is a matter of taste. The column headers are very strange, I thought those were tabs until it was mentioned those are headers. Maybe change the text to 'Ordered xx weeks ago' and 'Generated xx weeks ago'. Maybe also group connected items (like the Unit and Delivery charges) into one card with a separator.    I always think a nav-drawer is not necessary when there are only a few navigation spaces, especially when those are somewhat related. I would change 'My Jobs', 'Starred Jobs', 'Approved Jobs' and 'Pending Approval' into tabs.    On the orders-page, what is more important, the bill number/order number(?) or the name of the item? What of those information are important/necessary? What is the number in the middle of the cards?    I can make mock-ups on what I think, if you're interested? I hope my criticisms isn't to harsh.    Edit : I made some mock-ups anyway...    Edit 2 : This is what the same with list items could look like"

MaterialDesign,395ehq,OpulentUX,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:13:30 2015 UTC,"On the first image, those cards are really repetitive and boring. If each package has an associated image, could you make that into the cards somehow? Otherwise, make the status color more prevalent. This is your apps main page, so those cards need to shine. Also, the FAB should be for positive action (add, create, etc.) not for navigation. Move the search button to the app bar and get rid of the FAB. Also, the blue accent color doesn't work with the green.  I hate to say this, but the individual page needs a lot of work. The text in the top right is hard to read and badly placed. The title should not be centered. The camera icon (not sure why it's there) is hard to see. Consider moving the title and that small text to a colored block below the image that shrinks as you scroll. The FAB on this page is also useless, so move the back button to where it belongs in the top left. The column headers can't go there, because that's where tabbed navigation goes. Column headers are for tables with columns anyway, and cards are not tables. Instead, work that into each card, and make three cards more interesting and dynamic.   The navigation drawer looks great!  You really do have a good start."
MaterialDesign,395ehq,theDEVIN8310,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:05:07 2015 UTC,In this situation I think you should probably move away from a stream of cards to a list. Or at least something that is edge to edge (like Google+)

MaterialDesign,38c8zv,ellimistx99,7,Wed Jun 3 07:52:38 2015 UTC,"This is what I came up with. I rarely order meals, so I don't know if I missed something.    The first tab, 'Menu', shows the whole menu. All single items, menus, combos and so on. Of course everything can be added to 'My Order' from there (1).    The second tab could show special deals.    The third tab shows 'My Order'. Here you can add, edit and remove things for ordering. Orders are shown as cards with a nice image, basic information and options to edit or remove the item. Tapping the card could open a details view, showing more detail and customization.    The FAB adds new items, it splits into 'add single item', 'add menu' and 'add combo' (2). Each will open the respective 'add' forms (3 and 6).    3 - 5 shows how to add single items. On the first page, select category, item and quantity (or search), on the second add/remove extras (open/close details with the up/down carrot on the right; only one details view at a time, so that it is obvious where new extras are added), on the third one the order can be checked, finished or another item can be added (which will start again with 3). Pressing 'X' in the app bar from any screen will cancel everything and go back to 'My Order'.    6 - 9 shows the same process for combos. After selecting a combo on (6) the list will change so that you can select the items for this combo (7). On (8 and 9) extras can be added for each item, same as above. The last screen would be the same as above as well.    Edit, of course when scrolling down the list the app bar should minimize to make more room for the list. But I think apps about eating should be compelling and use large imagery to create appetite.  Do you think this could work?"

MaterialDesign,38c8zv,rob3110,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:34:42 2015 UTC,"First of all, wow that was REALLY quick! How'd you do that so fast?!  So it does look pretty interesting. Especially using tabs to setup the orders like that. I was thinking though should the Menu be separated so each item can potentially be shown off with hero images and a FAB to add to order? Say you wanted to see what was in the 'Extravaganza Pizza'? Would that warrant enough of a change to remove from the tabs list? I imagine selecting ""Menu"" should potentially bring up a tile display with categories like, ""Sides"" ""Mains"" ""Desserts"" ""Deals/Combo's"" with rich images. Then I was thinking, okay should all the individual pizza's be shown are cards with an action to add to list? Should the pizza cards expand in place or should they expand to a brand new view?  If we break ""Menu"" out of the tabs would it go in the hamburger menu? Then I imagine we wouldn't use tabs for Deals and then you'd get to My Order from either the shopping cart icon on the top right and/or the hamburger menu. What is appropriate?  On to the orders. Extra's would need to have prices so would pricing be only just the additions? For example would you just have ""+0.50"" next to Bacon on (4) ? Or does it make more sense to have a running total somewhere? If so, where would be the best place so it's visible constantly?  You see why I'm clearly not a designer lol  PS: Great icons where did you get them? And seriously how did you do this so fast? I'd love the APK lol"
MaterialDesign,38c8zv,rob3110,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:00:42 2015 UTC,"Those are a lot of questions.    I made myself a set of PS templates for Material Design, and with ever new mock-up I can add new things ore modify existing ones. Since it is modular I can copy and move stuff around easily.    The big images for the cards and the app bar are things I found on the internet. I think for a mock-up it is OK, but of course if I wanted to release an app I would either license it or make it myself. I made smaller icons myself based on the guidelines.    The other questions are more complicated and I would need some more time to come up with solutions.    What do you need/want it for?"
MaterialDesign,38c8zv,rob3110,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:19:47 2015 UTC,"Those small icons are amazing by the way.  Well at the moment it's just a curiosity.

I order food from FoodPanda and I suppose I sorta got to thinking about how if the franchise had their own app, how would it look and I realized I don't even have any design inspiration for it.   I mean, for fun, I would love to learn Android Dev and just make one for them to see if I can (since I'm on vacation) but mostly it's just a curiosity and fun to think about.

We all love material.   Here's my opinions on your progress so far:  I do think the time slider should be full width.   I'm not sure if this is possible, but I think it would look much cleaner if the music titles' cutoff point was around the same area as the divider of the controls' buttons - not the full width of the page.  I'd say keep the full search bar as you've shown in your mockup, searching is an important part of the experience I'm sure. You could reduce the width of the search bar to be in line with the divider, though.  You could create another (though slightly different) slider beneath the prev/play/next buttons that controls the volume. I'm not a huge fan of there being an entirely separate entity to control the volume."
MaterialDesign,3866s2,cherlyy,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:11:32 2015 UTC,Hey thanks for the feedback! :) I'll keep those ideas in mind when I play around with the mock a bit more over the next few days. I agree that some of the stuff could be aligned better + I've had reservations about the volume control in the past.
MaterialDesign,3866s2,divided_by_0,2,Tue Jun 2 17:10:40 2015 UTC,"Hey guys,  So, I've linked you to a couple of screenshots. The first one is what my app looks like currently. I'm happy with it, but I need to update it for a few reasons:   More functionality is needed: I need to be able to toggle on/off video and incorporate a button to do so. I want to prioritize the 'now playing' queue and searching more than the 'active playlist.' Users don't interact with their active playlist enough to warrant 1/2 of the app's window.   So, I've tried to shift things around a bit in the second screenshot. It's still just mocked up and some things might be a pixel or two off, but I'd like to know your general impressions.  My concerns currently are:   Is the 'current time' slider being flush with the edge of a card acceptable? I feel like it should be 100% width, but also feel like it should align with relevant elements. So, I snip off it's edges. There's a row of 7 icons which feels pretty weird. I've tried stacking the 4 gray icons on top of each other w/ 36dp click target, but this also felt weird. I thought stacking could be fruitful because it's done well here: https://dribbble.com/shots/1795733-Spotify-Material-Design/attachments/295885 The divider between the 'previous / play / next' buttons feels forced. Not sure how else I could approach this.  I'm trying to promote  the importance of the search input, but maybe it'd still be more appropriate to have it simply be a 'search' icon and then expand it into a full input later? I'd like to slide it over the 'Now playing' area when in use, but transitioning while typing feels incorrect, too. Generally feel like it's floating around in the middle.    Any constructive criticism appreciated, thanks. All CSS is hand-written / I'm not using Polymer.  It's also important to note that this is a browser extension. So, the user's mouse is in the upper-right hand corner implicitly when clicking the extension icon. So, that corner is to be thought similar to the bottom of a phone where a user's thumb would be."
MaterialDesign,3866s2,Beasto0,6,Tue Jun 2 03:21:49 2015 UTC,I'm not a designer so I'm probably not the best to give advice but I personally feel that the player/controls/slider should be at the bottom of the view. It would at least be nice to see that mocked up if possible!
MaterialDesign,3866s2,Beasto0,2,Tue Jun 2 04:12:37 2015 UTC,"Well, I can show you a mock later tonight or tomorrow when I'm off work, but a few concerns are:   Ease of use: The bottom of the extension is the farthest spot away from the user's mouse when they click the icon to open the extension, but controlling playback is the most common activity. It feels like bad UX to make the user move so far. There's a ""X songs selected   [Actions]"" menu which slides out from the bottom when the user selects songs. This would cover the playback controls which is a bit more concerning than if it covers the current buttons. It's just a temporary view, but preventing the user from being able to pause their music is kinda worrysome."
MaterialDesign,3866s2,7Point1,2,Tue Jun 2 17:13:08 2015 UTC,"Just one or two things.  * Floating Play Button or at least a menu button to get rid of the menu at the bottom and the play pause controls on the top right hand corner. Something that maybe spins up and offers the forward backward or seek track options. * * It seems a little cluttered, simplify it and make it easier to use. * If you don't do ^ at least make it less then one page or add a now playing screen."
MaterialDesign,3866s2,MoederPoeder,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:49:52 2015 UTC,"I'm really keen on having the player controls at the top of the extension, as stated in my post. Browser extension icons are in the upper-right hand corner of the browser. When a user clicks on the extension icon to open the interface - their mouse is implicitly at the top-right corner of my program's UI. Their most frequent actions are adjusting the volume and controlling music playback. So, I'd like those controls to be as quick to access as possible. More than happy to entertain ideas, but I don't feel like people consider UX for extensions when doing material design.  Can you explain what you mean by using a floating action button to get rid of the bottom menu? How would I convey the ""# of songs in queue"" message with just a floating button?  Again, easy to say simplify it... I've been working on this for over 3 years, it has 300K users who expect the current functionality to exist on the main UI. That is why I am here asking for help. How should things be shifted? What would you expect from a music player?"
MaterialDesign,3866s2,nathanrjones,3,Tue Jun 2 16:56:29 2015 UTC,"Ah alright, I was just stating that it would be better as having a separate page or something to get rid of most of my clutter. It's all on one page instead up being minimalistic and simple. You don't have to change anything, just my 2 cents. I would expect an easier layout for the users. Maybe add a template for how you want it displayed? You would be able to put what orientation and placement you want different objects."

MaterialDesign,380h70,GAntiLight,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:11:23 2015 UTC,"Done. I literally can't settle on a music player. Shuttle+ is great but no Album Artist. Musixmatch is good but kind of glitchy. Sony Music is goodtoo but can't manage to have artist pictures without messing up my meticulously tagged collection. Others I tried were just clunky or rid with various visual glitches.  Plus, most music apps on Android are Apollo forks, that while they look Material, they don't behave like it."

Apart from the artist zoom out animation, seems pretty good (the artist image just zooms out then glitches weirdly from square to circle) - but that's just me being nitpicky. Finally a music app that behaves like a material app should!"
MaterialDesign,380h70,folkrav,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:21:03 2015 UTC,Done! Looking forward to it!
MaterialDesign,380h70,Wulgaren,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:47:38 2015 UTC,please make it look like the Music App mockup from Googles IO 2014.
MaterialDesign,380h70,Streetwalker-,3,Mon Jun 1 18:20:32 2015 UTC,I don't know why google didn't do this themselves... I was very disappointed when I opened the app and saw it didn't look as good as the mockups
