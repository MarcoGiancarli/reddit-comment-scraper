camping,3e37md,SnakeOilGhost,5,Tue Jul 21 21:28:28 2015 UTC,"I believe that they go for the highest point. Me and a buddy were out a couple weekends ago and go mobbed (seriously, I've never seen deer flies that bad in Algonquin Park). So we went deer fly hunting. You stick your hands above your head, palms inwards, and wait. Eventually a deer fly will land on your palm and you smack it. Buddy of mine had a record of three at once, and when they were really bad we were killing several a minute."

camping,3e2nqp,cwcoleman,3,Tue Jul 21 16:29:44 2015 UTC,Yes were looking to backcountry camp through a stretch of Shenandoah. We will have two cars and we want to hike old rag on our last day. so were trying to figure out if its possible to park a car north of old rag and one at the base of the mountain and work our way down into the old rag area hopefully hiking some cool trails/waterfalls/streams along the way
camping,3e2nqp,cwcoleman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:42:04 2015 UTC,"When is the trip?       Old Rag will not be a remote or secluded spot. The main trail (not climbing) is nearly a conga line this time of year. Would you be willing to hike a different section, then drive a short distance to the Old Rag trail head? That way you could do something like the trail /u/Hard-blown-piper suggested, or a variety of other trails. Otherwise you are pretty limited in what you can complete, with ending spot of Old Rag.      The AT makes logistics super simple - especially since it intersects with skyline drive at mile post 43 so you could hike the fire road to Old Rag. The problem is that it isn't secluded - it will be full of thru and section hikers. While the major bunch of NOBO hikers have passed through, there are still plenty on-trail making their way to Maine. SOBO hikers are starting to make their way down too.        I guess it also depends on your definition of secluded... Are you talking about a spot where you see no one for 3 days straight? (very unlikely in SNP) Or is seeing people on-trail okay and you just want a campsite with on one in sight each night? If you camped in a spot off trail and avoid the official spots - there are more options. Although they all may not have water this time of year."
camping,3e2nqp,Hard-blown-piper,2,Tue Jul 21 17:46:24 2015 UTC,"Leave on 9/17 or 9/18. We definitely don't mind seeing people during the day we would just prefer to have a spot away from other campers at night  and yeah I don't imagine it will be a problem in a back country spot. And as for old rag, its just seems too fun to pass up so we're gonna go for it on our last day. i suppose we could put our cars at the ends of a stretch of good trails and then drive over to old rag on our last morning"

camping,3e129i,jayhawk73,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:53:23 2015 UTC,"The 4-season requirement makes the answer to your question - NO.       There are no tents that would withstand 4-season (i.e. winter) conditions reliably for under $200. However - there are plenty of 3-season (i.e. spring, fall, summer) tents that are available. Most can handle some snow just fine. Depending on the type of weather you expect in the winter- lots of 3-season tents will do the job. The main feature to look for is a fly that goes all the way to the ground. Plus strong poles and peg out points. Most campers, especially car campers, don't require 4-season tents. Your vehicle would likely be stuck in any situation where a 4-season tent would be required.           Or... maybe used is an option.

An extra cooler full of nothing but frozen water bottles and ice.  Extra folding camp chairs. Handy to put your feet up or to keep other items out of the dirt / mud.  Trash bags. Useful for all sorts of things besides cleaning up the site before leaving.  Extra shoes and socks. You probably won't need them but if you do you will be very happy you have them.  You can't have too many LED flashlights. +1 for the type with a holster you can put on your belt. +1 for the type with a red or blue mode to avoid burning out your retinas in the darkness. Headlamps are great when you are preparing food in the dark. I prefer them over lanterns. Watch Costco for multi-pack deals.  You can never have too many towels.  A small plastic tub for washing dishes.  Fritos Corn Chips are the best firestarters I have ever used. Throw a little pile under your kindling and they will burn hot for several minutes. I have started fires with wet wood and kindling using Fritos.  A plan for keeping whatever electronics you and your family deem essential charged up. DO NOT depend on untested solar anything to charge important stuff. Many of these devices barely work even in full sun (and you may not have full sun).  An air mattress feels like cheating to me but my wife insists. If you take one, take an electric (12 volt from the car) or battery operated pump. You will be very sorry if you don't have a pump. Setting up camp if hectic enough without spending 45 minutes wheezing into an air mattress. Try to buy a pump that will also deflate the mattress as this is a huge time saver when packing up."

I was from out of town and my friend handled the site reservation, so I can't advise on that. I understand you need to do it well ahead of time. Though the place was crawling with people during the day, they all had to leave on the last 5pm ferry so you and a handful of other campers have the place to yourself. The whole island to night hike around, explore the creepy buildings, and do battle with the bold raccoons. Great views of the Bridge, SF, Tiburon, and more. It was amazing."

Some of my favorite spots in each state;  Washington: Mt Rainier NP (good sites, and the drive is amazing)  Idaho: Mary M McCroskey State Park (on the border w/ Washington and no one is ever there and its free). The mountains in Sawtooth National forest is worth the dirve too.  Nevada: on the east side of the Ruby Mountains outside of Elko. (free, and less traveled.)  Utah: Valley of the Gods, Canyon Lands NP, and Goblin Valley are my favorites and also have free spots. Goblin valley has pay campground, but the free options are deeper in the park.  Arizona: Crazy Jug Point on the north rim of the Grand Canyon (free). And you cannot beat monument valley (1 hour away from valley of the gods).  New Mexico: El Malpais National Conservation area (free) and Rio Grande Gorge State Park which is a nice detour between Santa Fe and Taos.  Colorado: Clear Lake outside of Silverton (free), taylor Park Reservoir (cheap), and BLM land just north east of Rifle (free).  Kansas: Scott state park (east side is free), Pottawatomie State Park (north of Manhattan, and is free).  Nebraska: Just north of Ord is the state park of Fort Hartsuff State Historical Park. right next to it is some sort of outdoor shotgun shooting range. it is surrounded by cornfields. I hitched my tent there for the night. Toadstool Campground is worth a visit in the western part of the state. good spot between badlands and Colorado.(free)  South Dakota: Badlands NP  Wyoming: Jackson Hole campground in the Grand Tetons NP (free and amazing).  Montana: Blodgett Creek campground outside of Hamilton. free and clean  California : Mono lake, Prewitt Ridge, Boggs Mountain State Forest, South Cow Mountain OHV rec area (all free)  Oregon: the beach along Coos Bay. (free)  If time is not an issue, just winging it can be awesome. If you choose this route then perhaps you should purchase an Atlas for the sates you will be in for more than a week. they list every dirt road and patch of BLM land to camp on.

camping,3dubod,psilokan,13,Sun Jul 19 15:44:07 2015 UTC,FYI the inflatables likely aren't leaking; they're stretching. Each night you add more air because the fabric has stretched more.  To avoid this blow them up at home a week before you trip and keep topping them up each day.  Then they should hold their shape once you're out there camping.

Slept on it every summer for 8 weeks for like 5 years and it still sets up taunt like it was new. The XL was nice because it was wide enough to be comfortable for me.

Also warmer if you camp in the off season since most of them have some insulation. They will pack up nice and small too.  I have a thermarest which I have used over 100 times over the past decade and still going strong.   if you get cots do you have storage space?

A hammock stand is big enough for a full size human (6 feet) plus the length of rope to hang it, which would be at least another couple feet on both ends, so you're easily looking at 10 feet there.

The double-cot has a bar that might be uncomfortable according to reviews, but if you couple it with their awesome Deluxe Cot Pads then I doubt you would actually feel it. Make sure you measure your vehicle's trunk to see if it will fit. My 2 door Jeep fit the single person cot perfectly (without the back seat in). I love them cause they are so easy to set up and you don't need to set up a large tent. It takes around 3 to 5 minutes to set it up once you get the hang of how to do it. There are other brands that are cheaper, but their quality is not nearly as high. If you have a Cabelas store near you, you should check it out to see if its right for you."

This article from 2011 actually says that we still need to look into it, but that the original theory of why it was a problem isn't actually the problem.    the role of Al in AD has been heavily disputed based on the following claims: 1) bioavailable Al cannot enter the brain in sufficient amounts to cause damage, 2) excess Al is efficiently excreted from the body, and 3) Al accumulation in neurons is a consequence rather than a cause of neuronal loss. Research, however, reveals that: 1) very small amounts of Al are needed to produce neurotoxicity and this criterion is satisfied through dietary Al intake, 2) Al sequesters different transport mechanisms to actively traverse brain barriers, 3) incremental acquisition of small amounts of Al over a lifetime favors its selective accumulation in brain tissues, and 4) since 1911, experimental evidence has repeatedly demonstrated that chronic Al intoxication reproduces neuropathological hallmarks of AD.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21157018"

Instead of a pillow, get a mummy sleeping bag and wad up your sweatshirt, pants or both and use that as a pillow. After a long day of hiking that will be more then enough to fall asleep."
camping,3dphap,smow,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:35:26 2015 UTC,"second the gregory baltoro. mine's around 60L and works for 4-5 days if you pack light (i.e. essentials) I don't know how in shape you are, but I try to keep my pack at 13-15kg or less. The less you carry the more fun you have I've found!  also second the sweatshirt pillow. i'd recommend a down sleeping bag because they usually pack up smaller as well, at least the last time i bought a bag. mine's a 45 degree bag because i always sleep hot, and don't have to worry about winter weather. I usually sleep on the ground (in a tent) but if the weather is nice and bugs aren't a pain, a small tarp is enough to keep you off the ground. a sleeping pad is nice, but depends on the terrain on whether you need one or not. if you don't know much about the area you'll be sleeping, might be worth bringing as dive-buddy mentioned.  some other stuff you might already have covered by your research, but i like to remember every time before i go out:  be sure to use shoes that are not brand new. sounds like you're going on a pretty extensive hike, and your feet will thank you. i like a nice hiking shoe (merrell) or boot that has a stiffer sole than a cross trainer, since it keeps rocks and sticks from giving you a painful massage over the course of the trip.  if there is water along the hike, bring a small to medium water bladder (camelback is popular) and a filter pump. saves a lot of weight not carrying a ton of water, which is going to be the most important thing other than food.  speaking of food, if you plan to cook, and you can find some pre-made dehydrated meals, they are worth their usually expensive price. saves weight and they taste pretty good these days. saves you from having to plan a lot of prep and carry potentially heavy food items. they also won't get ruined if your pack gets wet. If you do cook and do it over a fire, make sure you have a lightweight pan that's large enough you can pull if off the fire without burning yourself. if you cook over a camping stove, make sure it's small enough to not tip your stove over! don't forget a small fork/spoon!  since you're going to a lake, there might be creeks/rivers to cross. bring extra socks in case your feet get wet. everything else will dry out as you wear it. i was a brand jumper for years, but rely on darn tough these days for the lifetime warranty, and they really have stopped my feet from blistering. i went from 1 pair to a drawer full over time. i also take at least one backup set of shirt/underwear in a ziploc type bag to guarantee dry clothes to sleep in.  a nice small flashlight with multiple brightness settings, and a small knife (3 inch blade) are also really nice to have, depending on your plans. some string can be handy... broken shoelace, need to hang a laundry line? that kind of thing.  really, you don't need much to have fun and be comfortable, these are just some things that i've grown to appreciate over time. i lugged an extra 30 pounds of gear and food etc 'just in case' and have learned to pare it down. still keep some specific backups as mentioned above, but it's amazing what you can live without for a few days :)  also, i would give yourself more than 2 days if you're hiking 18km to the trail head. that's a long walk, and i'm just basing that off not knowing how much farther the lake is beyond the trailhead!"

If you don't have your own boats, call Blue Water Kayaks and set things up with them. They will rent you kayaks, and they can provide boat support as well (ie, deliver your gear to the beach you camp on by motorboat so you don't have to pack it all on the kayaks).  It can get cold and foggy, so be prepared for that. You can camp on a pretty wide range of beaches - the ranger station where you pick up the permit can give you more details. Only a couple of beaches have bathrooms, and you can't dig holes at others - ie, pack out your poop if you camp away from the bathroom. There's no water, so bring enough water for your entire trip. Fires are sometimes allowed - check with the ranger. No wood collecting."
camping,3dnivt,diy1981,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:00:43 2015 UTC,"You mean Marshall Beach, on Tomales Bay?  I dunno the rules these days, but I've done it several times. GREAT spot. We'd kayak across from Marshall; they had a kayak rental place there where you could rent and/or launch/park. Some start up near Hog Island, but it's a longer paddle.  Tomales can get extremely windy, but the beach is weirdly sheltered from most westerlies. It's amazing. It can be a nice beginner paddle... or kill you. It is a baby great white area, after all, so don't fall in. But seriously: it can REALLY blow, enough to swamp a canoe or flip a kayak. It's only maybe a mile statue; but if you get blown or hit the current wrong it can be quite a bit longer. Usually the winds don't start to roar till the PM, but YMMV. I'm not sure if the kayak rental companies will rent you suitable boats without experience; we are very experienced paddlers.  And as diy1981 noted, you gotta bring water. I can't imagine they'll allow open fires, and you don't wanna drag wood. You may even need a campfire permit for a stove; you can get one online.  Even if you don't rent boats or paddle yourself, maybe you can hire someone to haul you there and pick you up later."
camping,3dnivt,211logos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:56:11 2015 UTC,Its great but the paddle difficulty can vary widely.  If you've never paddled it's probably not a good choice; go pick a lake.  Some of the camping spots are shared with cattle that can access the area.

camping,3dm5pz,bdgbill,2,Sat Jul 18 06:27:55 2015 UTC,"First, whatever number is on the box for indicating how many people can sleep in the tent, cut it in half. A ""two person"" tent is really a one person tent etc. Even if that second person is your partner you really don't want to be squeezed into a 2 person tent. My wife and I use a 4 person tent and use the extra room to keep our clothes and other items clean and dry.  I always bring and extra tarp or ""ground sheet"" to place on the ground under the tent. It helps keep the tent clean and dry.  I am a big fan of the ""cabin"" style tents. The available floor space is much more usable than in a dome tent because the walls do not slope so severely.  It is well worth your time to very carefully inspect the ground where you will erect your tent for stones, sticks and anything sharp. If you don't find them before putting the tent up you are likely to find them in the middle of the night when trying to sleep.  If you are only going for a couple of days and aren't sure if you will ever go again, don't be afraid to buy ne of the super cheap tents from Walmart (do you have WalMart in Australia?) or it's Aussie equivalent. They are mostly fine.   Consider erecting your new tent in your yard at home as a test. It will make things go much faster when you are setting up at your campsite.  A cheap LED light hung from the ceiling of the tent is 1000 times better than a flashlight and a fresh set of batteries will last for ages.  Hope this helps. Have fun!"
