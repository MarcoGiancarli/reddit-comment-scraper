Make sure that you eat an entire bag of cheetos before going through the cards, for reasons I'll explain later.       Another good way to get into playing is to buy an intro deck (doesn't matter what color), as some of the others have mentioned here.  Just make sure that after you get it, you look up other, more powerful cards that are out there, and slowly replace the entire deck.    A third option is to not play the game at all, and just speculate on cards that you think are going to spike in the near or distant future.    I bought beachfront property and retired early in Florida just speculating on Fold to Aether.  You can read how I did this in my new book, ""Next Level Speculating"""

Every single one in /r/magictcg is happy if he picks up duals at a flea market for 5 bucks, so they are clearly interested in having something valuable. They want to make trades with other players that favor them. They want to spend money on drafting. They want to have the thrill of ripping Boosters. They want it to be a trading card game. TRADING. You know when trading wouldn't work? If these cards had no value. And that value is based on how many people want that card.    All the discussion on how unaffordable modern has become has made /r/magictcg much more unenjoyable to read.     If you can't afford your T1 deck in a new format, build to it. That's how nearly everyone has done it.     ""The Barrier to Modern is too high"". Okay. You're saying it's too high for you. You know what? I started out playing magic at my LGS, thinking the barrier for standard was too high. Who would spend 80€ on 4 cards that are only 3 mana 2/2 hexproof? And I started playing budget deck at the time and had a great time and better sucess than I had with casual decks. And over time I started getting a greater card-pool, because over time I had more things to trade with. And then I bought 1 scalding tarn one day, because a ""budget"" UR Delver made top 4 at GP Prague. And I traded for another one. And I got the third one from a friend. And until I didn't get the last one, I lend it from a friend.  It's a trading card game about collecting cards, which have a value.

magicthecirclejerking,3cpmw9,Rebe1Scum,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:25:46 2015 UTC,"/unjerk  As usual, unless you're Billy Idol, it takes two to dance.  I've witnessed women play Magic at events, do well, win prizes, and go on to become pillars of the Magic community. I've seen women get offended at the asshats that go out of their way to make them uncomfortable, from asking them out, trying to buy them things, and generally ""white knighting.""  And there are women like the one linked above that insist the world change to better suit their needs.  Both men and women can exhibit shitty behaviour. Both the misogynists and misandrists can (and really ought to) fuck right off. THAT, I think, the community can agree on as a whole.  We have to tread a sometimes awkward line between building and maintaining an inclusive community and gradually weeding out (or changing the ways/mindsets of) people like the one in the linked post and the creepy anime-sleeve neckbeards and woman-haters who smell bad and are also fat.  I think the frustration stems from many people not recognizing this line, that both men and women have to work together, and from not knowing HOW we can walk it. I can't see the game lasting another ten years, much less twenty, if every issue becomes a controversy."

This guy would've been precedent setting, still would've sucked for him, but it would be understandable.  And that last bit of rhetoric doesn't really work. I guess if you enjoy turnabout. But this guy paid his debt to society, is married, and seemed to have his life on-track. He fucked up as a teenager.

magicthecirclejerking,3barba,jesusice,0,Sat Jun 27 14:13:16 2015 UTC,Honestly I just think we need to organize another buyout on a different card. There are too many copies of Fold into Aether and it isn't strong or combo-y enough to justify a price spike.     Also now we know that there are a bunch of people on this sub ready to spend money on silly cardboards.  A good target would be Ghostway if it didn't spike already
magicthecirclejerking,3barba,blueb4by,6,Sat Jun 27 20:06:52 2015 UTC,"I think we should see this buyout as a slow but steady grind, and over time just buy out every single copy that exists. Then we should all try to top 8 any modern event, and we are in the moneys."
magicthecirclejerking,3barba,animar37,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:24:34 2015 UTC,I guess that's a possibility but I don't know if we as a subreddit could do it.
magicthecirclejerking,3barba,blueb4by,3,Sun Jun 28 00:03:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I honestly think we are just going to drive the price up a few cents on Fold. We won't ever convince other people that it is good.  People seem to like stupid combos, but they need to be somewhat viable. A combo good enough to fool people into thinking it is good would be [[Enduring Renewal]] + [[Ornithopter]] / [[Memnite]] + [[Blasting Station]] / [[Grinding Station]].  Enduring Renewal is a timeshifted card and an ice age card, so there isn't as much of it out there as an uncommon like Fold(therefore its price will go up quicker). Plus, the Enduring Renewal deck could actually be decent whereas the Fold Into Aether decks are all horribly bad."

LET'S GO: http://www.reddit.com/r/magicthecirclejerking/comments/3aj5sb/meta_buyout_if_this_post_gets_50_upvotes/  Here are some thoughts on a target:   It should be Modern legal, just to create more opportunities for people to come up with random explanations for its sudden popularity. It should only have been printed once. Self-explanatory. I would say Mirrodin, Kamigawa, and Lorwyn blocks are the best targets because they featured lulls in Magic's popularity. Small sets are even better because they're naturally opened less often.   Here is a list of cards which fit these criteria. Sadly I couldn't find a way to exclude cards which have been reprinted.  Some choices which catch my eye:   Arcbound Fiend. Casuals love +1/+1 counters. Avarice Totem. Pretty whacky, seems like it could be a combo enabler. Carry Away. Fairly powerful but narrow effect, I've actually seen this played in EDH. Cauldron Haze. More like combo haze. Already $0.50, which is both a plus and a minus. Fold into Aether. The hot new Modern Show and Tell. Murderous Spoils. Similar to Carry Away. Obsidian Battle-Axe. Tribal!!!! Recross the Paths. Super strange and I've actually seen someone brew Modern Belcher with this card. Screams from Within. Good against tokens? Tallowisp. Ghost Dad was a fun deck.   Looking through these cards there were a bunch of cards that were weirdly high priced, so I feel like I chose good criteria. :) All the cards besides Cauldron Haze up above were like $0.20-0.30, though maybe a more expensive card is good because it shows there's already some demand."

There are several multinational corporations that own everything, the land, the factories, slaves, everything a person could possibly need is owned by these conglomerates, everyone works for them, everyone is miserable because these greedy fuck CEOs created the Cabal to keep the downtrodden masses under their thumbs. Eventually one universe wasn't enough for them...  They started recruiting mercenary Planeswalkers to go elsewhere and secure resources, like Chandra Nalaar, the infamous thief. She'd go to Mirrodin for them and steal trinkets like Mox Opals, Engineered Explosives, she even managed to kidnap Karn. But she wasn't doing it fast enough. The Cabal decided to create their own Planeswalkers. They knew that a person's latent spark could be ignited through severe stress or danger, so they began an indiscriminate torture program. Anyone who wasn't their slave was rounded up and tortured to the brink of death... any failures were thrown out into the street to die, while the new Planeswalkers were promised a life of luxury if they played ball.   We need powerful mages and spells for seeing the future, they said, find us Snapcasters and Fulminators, Meddling Mages and Cryptic Commands, find us Serum Visions.   Head to Zendikar and secure the land, they said. We need Misty Rainforests for their trees, we need Scalding Tarns for their sulfur, we need Ancient Stirrings just fucking because dude.   Head to Tarkir because dragons are fucking cool, they said. We need Deathmist Raptors because Chris Pratt is so hot right now, we need Ojutai and Den Protectors, we need to know the secret of these beasts, learn Dromoka's and Atarka's and Kolaghan's Commands, bring them back to our copyrighters who will duplicate them on thousands of scrolls.   I am a Planeswalker. I recently heard about Tarkir, the newest plane to be discovered. I finally went and found a land deserted... just a few lowly Dragons left. I visited each clan, looking for help, looking for spells I could learn to battle the evil Planeswalkers. Each place I visited had the same thing... a message written in blood:   ""The Cabal was here"" -Jason E Alt  Damn you, Jason. God damn the Cabal and the nefarious bastards behind all this...

He seems like a great guy.  I'm sure I'd love to have him play at my LGS and I bet he'd be fun to go have a beer with afterwards and talk about nonsense.  That said, his videos are mostly shitty over-long product reviews of accessories.  You don't need 30 minutes to review 5 brands of sleeves.  You need like 5 tops, or a 1000 word article.  The fact that people laud him as the second coming for producing videos with long low-quality content is astonishing and disheartening.  That it seems like someone who happened to be a nice guy is the one who stumbled into this improbable gold mine is the only silver lining here."
magicthecirclejerking,3a6f5d,doug4130,5,Wed Jun 17 22:41:02 2015 UTC,"what?  If I'm not sure about which products are available to protect my investment, I'd listen to someone talk for an hour about the pros and cons of each method.  I'm pretty glad I watched most of his vids before I sleeved my duals in shitty sleeves.  If a new product comes out, again, I'd rather hear how it stacks up compared to the other best contenders other than ""its better"" or ""its worse"".  Especially with deck boxes, there are apparantly tons of different kinds out there.  Some are durable, some are perfect but they might not fit 100 cards double sleeved, some have weak seals, etc.  How are you supposed to get all the information you need before you make a purchase if the reviewer doesn't go in depth with the product?  If you've spent a couple hundred or so bucks on cards then yeah I can see why these vids would seem long winded but when you've spent thousands they really come in handy because not everybody has the time to test out each individual product.  Also, I just checked his vids and I couldn't find any longer than 15 minutes, with the vast majority being between 5-10 minutes long."
magicthecirclejerking,3a6f5d,jesusice,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:54:01 2015 UTC,"He's reviewing cheap consumables, not cars or TVs.  The ""how am I supposed to know before I buy"" thing is kind of weak.  Do you read / watch video reviews of toilet paper?  Notepads?  Socks?  Or do you just buy them when you need them and if you don't like them, not buy that brand again?  A pack of sleeves is $3-$10.  And even if you love them, you've got to replace them regularly anyway.  It's not as if there's zero value here.  But it's overblown and he draws the videos.  Seriously, I can see the differences between deckboxes for the most part.  This one's plastic, that one's cardboard.  This one has a place for dice.  That's not hard."
magicthecirclejerking,3a6f5d,doug4130,2,Wed Jun 17 23:01:17 2015 UTC,"it's hard to tell the quality of a seal or if the box fits 100 cards double sleeved just by looking at it, I'd rather know that before potentially wasting my money/time.    Your comparisons are off as well, the things you listed don't really pertain to a hobby.  When you're into a hobby and want equipment that performs well then yes, you read/watch video reviews or talk about it with other people who are into it so you don't waste your resources on crappy quality merchandise.  An artist will read/watch reviews on pencils/charcoal/paper, someone who's into soccer will read reviews on cleats and maybe even socks, someone who's into music will read reviews on which headphones perform better.  If you're not really into your hobby or don't give a shit how you spend your money then yeah I can see why you wouldn't care but videos like this are a pretty sweet resource for people who do."

It's called a HAM sandwich for a reason, not because the basic idea is good.   In competitive lunchmaking you have to choose between all the ingredients legal in the format and choose the ones with the best consistency, efficiency, and synergy. You also need to consider the meta-meal. What are other people eating? What makes their lunch good? How do their condiments interact?   Now I'm not even saying ham sandwich is necessarily a good choice but it may be appropriate in your meta. But if you're going to build it you absolutely need real ham and cheese. Not spam, not balogna, ham. A lot of chefs and cooks have gone before us and achieved great results with ham sandwiches. Ever hear of anyone winning a competition with Kraft singles cheese slices? No! They use real cheese.   I know it may seem expensive now* but it's worth it if you seriously want to compete.
