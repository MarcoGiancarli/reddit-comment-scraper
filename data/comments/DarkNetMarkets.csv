DarkNetMarkets,3e1vh9,andblowyourhousedown,18,Tue Jul 21 08:59:18 2015 UTC,Thank you for doing this!
DarkNetMarkets,3e1vh9,BaileyJayOFFICIAL,7,Tue Jul 21 09:04:08 2015 UTC,"You are more than welcome, my friend."
DarkNetMarkets,3e1vh9,dixondixond,14,Tue Jul 21 09:06:28 2015 UTC,this is why gamma is the man
DarkNetMarkets,3e1vh9,Jnew777,14,Tue Jul 21 10:42:58 2015 UTC,What clinches the deal for me is that he also sells mescaline.  High-quality LSD + mescaline = All my darknet needs in a nutshell.
DarkNetMarkets,3e1vh9,LedLevee,3,Tue Jul 21 10:48:06 2015 UTC,I just did a gram of his mescaline this past weekend. Amazing.
DarkNetMarkets,3e1vh9,Interversity,4,Tue Jul 21 13:35:44 2015 UTC,"Would you mind elaborating on that experience? Perhaps in a separate post even? Very interested in Mescaline myself, so that's why."
DarkNetMarkets,3e1vh9,LedLevee,7,Tue Jul 21 13:57:42 2015 UTC,"Synthetic mesc in particular is very subtle. Visuals are not very apparent beyond brightened colors and such, although at higher doses (500-600mg+) you will definitely have some. The comeup is like LSD lite, and after the peak you just sort of... roll down smoothly, is the best way I could put it. Nice energy. Feelings increase in intensity - when you look over a spectacular view and you get those chills? Multiply it 10x.   If I had to choose one word to describe it, it would be subtle. It's a much different headspace than LSD or shrooms, which are both rather mind fucking. Very lucid."
DarkNetMarkets,3e1vh9,Interversity,2,Tue Jul 21 14:25:24 2015 UTC,"Ye the fact that the headspace is a lot more clear is what attracts me. LSD is too much mindfuck for me sometimes.   I'm wondering if I should do 250mg. Lots of people describe it as very ""MDMA-like"" at those kind of lower doses. I'm also not so sure if you I just want to straight dive in and do 500mg from the start.   Music appreciation and just general high-ness are most important for me."
DarkNetMarkets,3e1vh9,LedLevee,3,Tue Jul 21 16:04:04 2015 UTC,~500mg was almost too subtle. I would not bother doing any less.
DarkNetMarkets,3e1vh9,Interversity,2,Tue Jul 21 16:07:34 2015 UTC,"Really? https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mescaline/mescaline_dose.shtml  That really contradicts Erowid then. Did you have any tolerance? Not saying your experience wasn't what it was, but just confused. Some people eat a gram of this stuff and others say 200-300 is amazing already."
DarkNetMarkets,3e1vh9,LedLevee,4,Tue Jul 21 16:12:09 2015 UTC,"Zero tolerance. Huxley took 400mg and you can see from reading Doors of Perception that it wasn't really an intense experience.   To be fully honest I was quite underwhelmed. I would probably go for 600mg if I was to do it again. That said, everyone reacts differently. I can only tell you what I experienced."
DarkNetMarkets,3e1vh9,FagDamager,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:57 2015 UTC,"Eh, wish I got more than a gram now. Oh well. We'll see! Thanks for the help :)"

DarkNetMarkets,3e1vh9,FagDamager,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:25:14 2015 UTC,"Totally normal. I spent the entire day with a bunch of my friends at a mini theme park type place with lots of other people around. No anxiety about it, had a total blast. Literally, you would have a harder time knowing I was on mesc than on weed."
DarkNetMarkets,3e1vh9,Interversity,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:31:16 2015 UTC,oh really? that sounds sick. i always thought it made you walk funny and be anxious around people
DarkNetMarkets,3e1vh9,notverybrightperson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:32:55 2015 UTC,"I mean, I don't know how you will react to mescaline, maybe you would get anxious. I found it very manageable and it was actually easier for me to interact with others - I have mild social anxiety, and it was pretty much gone the whole time."
DarkNetMarkets,3e1vh9,dajigo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:35:09 2015 UTC,Mescaline reminds me more of MDA than LSD or shrooms. I've only ever extracted it rather than having synthetic mescaline but I can't imagine the experience is any different.
DarkNetMarkets,3e1vh9,dnm201,5,Tue Jul 21 21:30:31 2015 UTC,"A gram of mesc is on my bucket list. It will probably be a while till I get the chance, and most likely I'll go for the full spectrum of san pedro. Have you gotten a chance to try both natural extracted (full spectrum) and synthetic mescaline?"

DarkNetMarkets,3e35w7,throwaway8089078,33,Tue Jul 21 16:32:01 2015 UTC,and heroin will make you an upstanding and productive member of society.
DarkNetMarkets,3e35w7,drimilr,8,Tue Jul 21 17:41:04 2015 UTC,can confirm.
DarkNetMarkets,3e35w7,1ccofheroin,10,Tue Jul 21 18:39:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what this is supposed to imply, MXE does have beneficial properties though.. Especially for people with depression and anxiety, there's a huge difference in effects depending on dosage. I can definitely relate to the feeling of luckiness that OP mentioned, though it might be because i was finally able to accomplish things i couldn't do normally.   If you take only 5-10mg you're not even really feeling high, and you're actually more creative and outgoing. That's what i used off/on and worked very well. Though, if you're taking more which is what OP is probably doing, you'll be too wonked out to be productive."
DarkNetMarkets,3e35w7,Com__Truise_,3,Tue Jul 21 21:43:06 2015 UTC,"i was being mostly sarcastic.   but to follow your thinking, heroin does have beneficial, medically documented purposes as well. i mean it was originally thought to be good at getting people off morphine.  but it is great at killing pain. it's also a great at treating depression albeit temporarily.  and it provides a high that, at first, is a motivating, productive high.  all these ""benefits"" fade once the addiction overtakes its positive effects. and in heroin's world, that is pretty quick.  yes, MXE, can help with opiate detox, yes, it's been shown to boost mood and alleviate depression. but again, it's fleeting once the addiction takes over. i think the crash and burn and ultimate disappearance of the good MXE vendors is pretty strong anecdotal evidence that  MXE addiction is real;  we've seen it first hand here at the dnms."
DarkNetMarkets,3e35w7,drimilr,4,Tue Jul 21 22:24:15 2015 UTC,I read this too. The Wiki on MXE shows promise. After reading I wanted to give it a shot.

DarkNetMarkets,3e35w7,Vegetano,3,Tue Jul 21 17:58:10 2015 UTC,"I swear MXE cures my anxiety and aspergers to a degree.  And it's not even when I'm high on MXE, the afterglow is just magical and makes me say and do things that I would never do sober.  I know it's probably bad to take often and leads to mania, but my personality type is the opposite of mania so those feelings are like a godsend to me.  I rarely actually take a recreational dose of MXE these days, even though I love them.  I seriously consider MXE to be a medicinal medicine.  I usually do a small, hardly active bump before work and it gives me energy and focus, it melts away my social anxiety.  It actually makes me feel normal for once in my life.  And I'm a former heroin addict of 7+ years.  The afterglow of a big dose or the effect of a small daily dose beats the ""content with everything"" feeling of heroin by a long shot.   And I know that everything must be too good to be true, and that I'm just pushing myself towards another uncontrollable addiction.  I've long felt that all drugs are trade offs between feeling good now and feeling shitty later, that you can't get something for nothing.    But with MXE; just the price per dose, the non-physical addictiveness, the lack of a come down and even a positive comedown, and the mental health benefits to me.  It all feels like the reward of this drug far outweighs it's risks.  I see why MXE is so addictive but as a former hardcore heroin addict I know I can't have a recreational drug and a medicinal drug in the same thing.  I've been stopping my weekend high doses for daily very small medical doses  Edit:  Even more anecdote, I've been single and very lonely and withdrawn for the past couple years.  Since I started taking MXE a lot has changed in my personal life.  I almost had a 3 some with these two beautiful girls on the 4th of july weekend...but I had to turn it down because morals.  Could just be a coincidence but this shit makes me want to better myself and gives me confidence in myself whereas lately I've been suicidal.  Other people notice this."
DarkNetMarkets,3e35w7,knowonespezal,2,Tue Jul 21 18:12:00 2015 UTC,Would you say MXE has opiate-like effects?
DarkNetMarkets,3e35w7,1ccofheroin,2,Tue Jul 21 18:41:43 2015 UTC,"in a way, it makes you super relaxed, makes you feel light, but thats about as much opiate-like as it is. otherwise its way different, kills depth perception, coordination, makes you really numb, and makes you really emotional. at really high doses you black out and go into a dream-like state"
DarkNetMarkets,3e35w7,Saliv,2,Tue Jul 21 20:19:58 2015 UTC,"I would. It agonizes the mu-opiod receptor as well, which would explain it. When close your eyes on a moderate-light dose, it feels like you just popped an Oxy."

DarkNetMarkets,3e3kg1,sirvapesalot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:21:09 2015 UTC,What is speed paste out of curiosity?
DarkNetMarkets,3e3kg1,krokodiltear,2,Tue Jul 21 18:54:19 2015 UTC,"Amphetamine aka ""speed"" is made up of two sided isomers, Dextroamphetamine, and Levoamphetamine. They have slightly different effects (d-amp is said to be more smooth/less jittery), although they pretty much have the same effects.  Adderall is comprised of 25% Levoamphetamine and 75% Dextroamphetamine. Pharmaceuticals made up of 100% Dextroamp and 0% of the Levoamp side are usually known as Dexedrine or simply Dextroamp (I don't think it's commonly prescribed by doctors in North America though).   The amp you find on the street is a racemic, 50-50 mixture of d-amp and l-amp, and can be found in varying degrees of quality, from the ""speed paste"" that you're describing, which is a smelly, wet yellowish paste that's cut to shit with impurities/caffeine and often sold by Dutch vendors. There's a few vendors selling it in nice, off-color white powder though, aka pure amphetamine sulfate (the vendor SuperSpeedBros on Agora and his resellers carry this quality, I believe).  Edit: Also worth noting that the term ""speed"" in North America is often associated with methamphetamine instead, where street speed is virtually non-existent (99% of the world's supply of clandestine amphetamine is made in Europe). Meth will generally come in clear/white crystals that look way different than amphetamine though, so it should be very easy to tell them apart."
DarkNetMarkets,3e3kg1,sirvapesalot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:11:43 2015 UTC,"So simply put adderall is basically speed in it's purest form, and methamphetamine is it's own molecule rather than having two separate pharmaceutical amphetamines is various ratios?   As far as negative health effects how does speed (assuming it's not cut with impurities) compare to adderall? And how does meth fit into that?  Edit: from the sounds of it op would be good with speed paste, but probably associates it with methamphetamine like you said."
DarkNetMarkets,3e3kg1,krokodiltear,2,Tue Jul 21 19:34:58 2015 UTC,"So simply put adderall is basically speed in it's purest form?   Adderall is prescription amphetamine, so in that sense, it's in its purest form and doesn't contain any noticeable impurities that you'd find in most street speed. Whether you consider its 75% d-amp, 25% l-amp the ideal ratio is more a matter of personal opinion though.   methamphetamine is it's own molecule rather than having two separate pharmaceutical amphetamines is various ratios   Yeah, meth is another CNS stimulant altogether with a similar chemical structure and comparable physical properties. It's more neurotoxic/euphoric, although the similarities between amp and meth would probably shock a lot of soccer moms that often let their kids take Adderall for minor attention deficit disorders.  Meth produced in clandestine labs is also found in racemic, ""dextrorotary and levorotary"" isomer mixtures though. A more dextro ratio like you find in Adderall (or in this case, Desoxyn, aka pharmaceutical meth) has to be artificially produced and isolated.   As far as negative health effects how does speed (assuming it's not cut with impurities) compare to adderall? And how does meth fit into that?   High-purity street speed is basically the same thing as Adderall, although it's a bit harder to dose responsibly and in my opinion, is a bit more euphoric/less productive. There really isn't much difference imo though. I'd make sure to do an acetone wash if you're buying less pure speed paste before consuming though, as well as drying it out first.  Meth is a whole 'nother animal. It's actually pretty shocking how people perceive meth vs. amphetamine in mainstream society when in all honesty, their effects are quite similar, but it's definitely more neurotoxic, euphoric, and addictive than amphetamine. A lot of people get into smoking/injecting meth though, which aren't particularly common roa's with amphetamine."
DarkNetMarkets,3e3kg1,sirvapesalot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:03:40 2015 UTC,That's what I thought. I have an adderall prescription and I have always just called it prescription meth. It's an amazing drug but like you said not a whole lot of people think of it as practically the same as speed.   You're very well versed in stimulants it seems. You remind me of myself though besides my prescription my knowledge of stimulants is limited.

Anyone vending cheap, bulk quantities of Adderall is almost guaranteed to be selling knockoffs from India, which has been a rampant problem on the markets for years.  The legit Adderall is coming from domestic, small-time vendors selling their personal stash in tiny quantities for exorbitant prices (think $15 for a 30mg IR pill...). Absolutely ridiculous, yet the demand never seems to let up.  Like others are saying, getting a prescription from a MD is the ideal option. If you can't wrangle one up though, another option is trying to find a vendor with some amphetamine sulfate. It's basically the exact same thing as Adderall, albeit with a racemic d/l-amp mixture instead of the 75% d-amp, 25% l-amp isomer ratio found in adderall. An absolute bargain for the price (like 1/10th the cost of pharm Adderall on the darknet)."

Edit: Alright, it also says something about four salts as well... guess I'm gonna have to do some more reading, I have no idea what role they'd play.

Since that time, as I am sure you are probably aware, Nuke has been on the fritz the past few days limiting my ability to access the market at all. I haven't been able to log in to Nuke for more than short periods of time and that has left more messages unaddressed than I'm comfortable with. I do not take your concerns lightly and as soon as the market is back up I would like to address them with you as quickly as reasonably possible. Take care.   Respectfully,  TheMadDabber  edit: formatting, spelling"

I mean each batch i ordered would be all good or all bad.  It was never mixed where some would be good and some bad, if that makes a difference.  I tested this theory a few times, and it was so hit or miss with the vendor that I believe they didn't know.  The vendor started to assume they were fake from the complaints their clients were giving them.    They were just a middleman.  But their supplier has since ""quit"" so I'm assuming they ran out of real ones, and now just do the shit ones. or ""replicas.""

For Norco for instance, the average dole out at the doc is 120 pills.  Get 10 of these patients and you have a stock of 1,200 pills, not bad.  Have a few of these arrangement spread over the month and you could keep a consistent supply through the month.  I remember my pill mill days, you'd see those huge ass white econoline vans (like churchs use for field trips) full of elderly patients, almost always poor.  They were driven by a very helpful young man (doing his good deeds obviously, taking grandmas and grandpas to their doc).  Each van would have probably 10-15 patients.  There would be several vans throughout the day.  Then off to the one pharmacy who'd actually accept this pill mill doc's script and you'd pay a good amount for the script.  Opioids are damn cheap unless you get into extended release.  Anyway stuff like that are ways to get pharm fresh pills in some decent volume.

DarkNetMarkets,3e3m17,mxeforme,4,Tue Jul 21 18:41:21 2015 UTC,"Look, you aren't the shittiest kid ever.  But you are acting immature and its time to grow up.  Bottom line, you still live at home and its their rules.  In addition, don't put them at legal risk ordering to their house.  You can create a lot of problems for them.  I'm assuming you live in the US, but drug laws are not kind - especially the economic ones.  LE likes taking people's property and drugs, esp distribution or sales, can let them do so.    You may not like it but its time to stop dealing/ordering for a while.  You have other skills.  Flipping weed isn't the only thing you know how to do.  At worst, you can find a job that requires no real skills until you can figure out what you want to do.  A legit job is hard work.  Its often boring and shitty.  It won't be as easy as flipping weed.  But it is what it is.  Work fast food, work doing manual labor, you can find something.  Save up for a place and move out.  But try to keep a good relationship with your family.  Unless they are fucked up evil, they are the only ones who will stick with you and it sounds like they do care about you.    Good luck to you.  If your family is kind to you (even if they do shit you may not agreee with), they are worth keeping around.  Follow the straight and narrow for a while, get your bearings, and figure out what it is you want to do with your life.  Life is about taking what you want.  Think big.  Work towards whatever it is you find you want out of life."

Is there a way to connect to tor where you're not anonymous at all? I would have figured most tor connections would have the same security (excluding os, etc.)"
DarkNetMarkets,3dzuzs,Sansasaslut,4,Tue Jul 21 08:19:16 2015 UTC,"Why is the security different if it still connects to the tor network?   The app itself might be alright but you're still running it on android which means that it can already be infected with malware (infections on mobile devices are an increasing trend and a lot of users have no antivirus software on it and also install apks from shady sources). Such malware could easily steal your login data from markets with a keylogger and therefore can shake you down for more than a few bucks.  You don't have this problem with tails since it resets all changes which were done during your session when you shut it down (in the non-persistent mode). So even if you somehow managed to infect your computer during your ordering session with tails, you just have to reboot tails to get rid of the malware. Moreover the points of attack on the PC are more known than on the rather new mobiles.   Is there a way to connect to tor where you're not anonymous at all?   When the nodes you're connected to are controlled by an attacker or when there's already malware on your OS. So while the connections on mobile devices are as good as on a PC you have to pay attention to the big picture. That means a secure TOR connection is useless if an attacker has already remote access to your device. So use tails for ordering to minimize the risk of getting fucked. Better spend a few minutes booting tails than taking an unnecessary risk.  Hope for the best and prepare for the worst."

DarkNetMarkets,3e29a3,WorldAStage,0,Tue Jul 21 14:28:44 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sure a love letter won't affect you traveling abroad. If no further action has been taken by the border force against you then I don't see a reason why you would be scrutinized in customs.   Remember, the package was sent to you and you have no idea where it came from if the border force find it."
DarkNetMarkets,3e29a3,torr0t,0,Tue Jul 21 14:25:49 2015 UTC,Cheers all. I too think I'll be ok but could do without the hassle (and the moaning from the missus if we get searched!)
DarkNetMarkets,3e29a3,IsItFUD-MerckKGaA,0,Tue Jul 21 14:35:14 2015 UTC,"I can't help you on the topic of what will happen. But chances are they don't check your passport at all at Folkstone. The British side that is. If you are traveling with a UK numberplate the French will check your passports but usually they don't scan them. They just count them (people in car vs. number of passports, that is my experience for EU passports, never had a non EU person with me and I never got stopped by the French with a numberplate from the continent). If you arrive directly  after your letter (A,B,C,D) has been allowed for boarding at the check in there is a good chance you will be in a group of cars that gets a routine wipe down. One security guy (they are neither border force nor police, more like the people at the airport that check your luggage) will walk around the row of cars wearing cotton gloves and wiping all the door handles (all cars get checked at the same time). A second guy will walk from driver to driver and swipe your steering wheel. Again one swap for all the cars. While he is doing that he will be asking you if it is your car (just say yes, don't explain that it is your uncles or whatever even when it is. Won't make a difference anyway and he is only interested in how calm you are). About 3 minutes later you all will be allowed to drive back to the queue. I don't know if they are testing for drugs or explosives, maybe both. But whenever I came with the first flush and not last minute for my boarding letter I got pulled in the testing queue (male in business clothing and non cheap car). After the first time I made sure to wipe everything down with wet wipes multiple times. Might just be paranoia. I don' know what happens if their test comes up positive. But I assume they will then test each car separately. I am just explaining this so no one freaks if they look closer. All cars are on the same swipes, might not be because of you.  Now getting into the UK is a whole different story and you will have more fun at Calais, again the French don't care. I am a EU citizen, non British non permanent UK resident status. I have been quizzed for up to 10minutes even when there were gigantic queues. So were people in cars with UK numberplates of which I assume that they also have UK passports. Quizzing was mostly about were I am traveling from, to and why, whose car it is, how long I plan to stay and so forth. I am polite but the answer to all those questions should actually be go fuck yourself you have no legal right from stopping me entering the country. They will ask nearly the same questions again and again. It is rather pointless, even if you are making a story up you shouldn't be so daft and changing it just because the question is phrased differently or the question is only implied. So if you are traveling from Amsterdam either tell them straight or make the story fit and stick to it. No chemical tests on this side ever (don't blame me if there are). But there are always dogs around. Although I think it is fairly certain that those are trained to find illegals not stuff. Source?= I have driven through the channel tunnel more then a 100 times for legitimate business and the fact that they did never say or ask about that suggests that the passport scanning by the British on entering the UK does only lead to a thumbs up or down nothing detailed.  TL;DR everybody gets some scrutiny and it seems to be mostly a psychological check. So if you do something illicit you can't be scared and do not have traces on door handles or steering wheel when leaving the UK."

The price is still manageable from a business standpoint since Lostheaven successfully offers a kilo for $6.5k and the quality and service is on par with the other EU vendors. doing $10k-$11k. So that in itself doesnt autonatically raise red flags. But he is pushing this $6k offer hard and is apparently only FE for all or most offerings, so buyers should proceed with caution.

Her shipping times are now perfect, though she still has unscheduled breaks from time to time.  I recommend HOS since it's domestic, high quality, priced right.  BV is known to be underdosed and lack customer service.  TGUK and GG are the best market public options but both are international, and, lack a certain degree of professionalism. Definitely high quality product at a righteous price though.  The best of all is JOR via TMG, but he is not domestic.  value.lucid, xxxplosive, cali-connect, and other 'popular' vendors, are so because their product is weak and unknowingly shilled by people who do not know what a proper dose is."

That wasn't very kind whatsoever. It's okay for you , or anyone to think I am a douche. I don't expect you to appreciate the concept of time management. If you choose to mature and develop you will discover that time is very precious. If not already, soon you will move onto to college or a trade perhaps. Relationships should become more stable and meaningful. You may start a family, get divorced, all the while continuing your profession and or trade. Next thing you know you are 40 yrs old. So I do value my time, as well as others, and I expect the same in return. I do not, nor will I ever apologize for such an expectation.  A boring story can come to life or become comical with the use of a hyperbole."

DarkNetMarkets,3e1pc7,ADopelessHopefiend,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:26:30 2015 UTC,I'd put money on most beach houses mail being handled by a management company. In off season I'd imagine all mail goes to mgmt co.. in rental season the current renter may be able to get mail there but may be at the discretion of mgmt Co (might depend on length of stay). The owner may always have their addressed/gen delivery mail go to mgmt co.

DarkNetMarkets,3e0nn6,iliveintor,2,Tue Jul 21 21:41:37 2015 UTC,"This has also happened to me as well a handful of times, although not with any DNM orders (yet). It doesn't happen consistently, just every so often. The tracking on a package will say it was delivered to me but I never got it. I call USPS customer service and they'll give me a case number and tell me that they'll look into it with the local post office, which might take a couple days. A couple days later, the mailman delivers the package. The explanation always has something to do with how the packages are scanned, I don't remember exactly what. I can't tell if it's just them making mistakes, like the employees at the local branch are just kinda shitty at their jobs, or if there's something shady going on. But like I said, this has happened with non-illegal packages, stuff I've ordered off Ebay or Amazon or whatever, so I don't hesitate to ring them up and ask where my package is. If it was a DNM package, I think I would call them up simply because there's precedence for packages not showing up for whatever reason in my case. It could very well be nothing, but at the same time, I understand being hesitant to inquire further. I feel like if it was a legit LE concern, you would have been paid a visit by now. I don't think they would just make your package ""disappear."" If the mailman is stealing your drugs, he has more to lose in this situation than you do, really. In this case, you may as well just call it in. If questioned about it, he's obviously not going to admit it, and the last thing he's gonna say is anything about drugs. If anything, he'll get the message to stop fucking with your packages once somebody starts asking about them."

DarkNetMarkets,3dz7vo,rogueXleader,8,Mon Jul 20 18:55:13 2015 UTC,"Having a database rollback is a very plausible explanation if something happened to corrupt the latest version, vendors reported being able to login with a previous password which is a good sign. They will need to treat individual cases to update the wallets for deposits that were made before the rollback/after the backup was made.  I have contacted VRC on the forums and I suppose I'll post an update in a reply here or a new topic. It's very worrying as a lot seems to be going on, but I'm skeptical as to there being shills jumping on the issues as an opportunity to again dirty their reputation."
DarkNetMarkets,3dz7vo,Axaq,4,Mon Jul 20 19:29:04 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you. I'm on the fence as I've defended Nucleus and have never had a problem using the market. Don't want to dirty their reputation. They're doing just fine at that all by themselves. I just want a statement from VRC himself explaining the situation and planned steps to move forward. I didn't lose anything personally, but I hate to see reputable vendors getting shafted with very little official explanation"
DarkNetMarkets,3dz7vo,Axaq,3,Mon Jul 20 19:33:26 2015 UTC,"I actually wrote a long post similar to this earlier and then didn't post it, I'm letting things play out because I don't believe right now they are a risk from what I have seen.  The redirected purchases are a worry as I investigated some of the listings that were said to be directing to FE listings on purchase, there was no malicious XSS in the listings anywhere and they went through to checkout for me just fine, I'm guessing they were shills or the malicious code was removed after these orders were placed.  I highly doubt Nucleus was behind these, which leads me to believe there is just lots of FUD being spread and issues are being exaggerated because of this. I'll try get hold of VRC anyway, be sure to ping me if there is any word here."

Its the vendor's fault that you have to keep putting money into nucleus to buy their drugs. They didn't have to list there. They decided to make nucleus popular by attracting shoppers there, and now they're complaining about their own judgement?  After forcing you to frequent Nucleus marketplace, its vendors have a responsibility to use their collective power to sort the place out. I bet they're acting every man for himself, trying to shout over everybody else to get the last parachute.  They should be deposting poison bitcoin to map the site's digestive system, in case it gets switched off. It won't get their bitcoin back, but once they've followed a few cents to the site's poop-chute and publish it, the site's owner will inevitably be in jail this time next year.

You've contributed to the discussion, and seem like a pretty wise guy, so no complaints as to your take on the situation. We all agreed it was a good idea to do something to cut down on all the bullshit posts with no merit, largely thanks to Hacks4Crack, and this is an unfortunate side-effect of fine-tuning that system.  I don't want anyone's reputation to be dragged through the dirt without solid information, which is part of the puzzle we're still lacking the majority of. I would much prefer to directly request the admin to make a statement rather than post some suspected exit-scam prediction. Purely from a professional standpoint, it just makes sense. The longer we have to wait to hear any updates from someone other than their supposed PR guy, the more concern will grow that this is more than just a server rollback or some malicious attack by an outside party.

DarkNetMarkets,3e0d0d,zman67777,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:18:42 2015 UTC,"A very good point to bring up! In short, nothing. But declaring that metadata is ""the actual important part of the e-mail"" is highly dependent on circumstances, and on the additional measures that users take to mitigate such threats.  The most significant way to mitigate the metadata threat is by using strongly pseudonymous identities or ""nyms"" for all of your correspondence from an account that uses GPG and other content-privacy tools. If it is not known who is actually behind that metadata that can be surveilled, or where they are located, then much of the damage that it can do is eliminated.  However, even then, metadata can still inflict some damage. For instance, the times and dates that a person sends messages can be used to identify which timezone they're in, or even which region they're in if local holidays might affect when they do their messaging. Time data can also strongly infer whether or not a person has a full-time job, or any other regularly-scheduled activities. Such data, combined with other data points that can work to ""narrow down"" the potential identity of a surveillance target, can eventually contribute to a positive identification of such a target, at which point their end-point security could be compromised and the cleartext messages read by the adversary - though only at significant expense.  The last important aspect of metadata is in who one is communicating with, and the social networks that this can contribute to. For instance, in our case, the network of communication partners of a DNM vendor is going to be very easy to distinguish from the network of a DNM buyer. This is, unfortunately, mostly unavoidable using standard email and OpenPGP systems. Such profiling can, with relative ease, identify particular users who are likely to be ""high-value"" candidates for targeted surveillance, and potential endpoint attacks that could actually compromise the whole security of the communications channel.  There are decent ways to avoid the metadata problem, but all have certain shortcomings. One popular one these days is BitMessage, which does indeed secure the metadata as well as the contents of messages, but is difficult to use if either party to a communication is not able to be online regularly. A similar tool is I2P-Bote, which has even greater anonymity/pseudonymity capabilities than BitMessage, and in its current state is much more forgiving of downtime of its users (but with more than a month offline, message delivery is still unreliable, potentially even moreso than BitMessage).  My apologies if any of this does not actually address what you really meant, but I hope that it's useful information in some way, to someone, regardless."

So if you are willing to risk your privacy over something that is cheap form a vendor who really doesn't care if your package arrives I would say try it out. If not buy in house depending on where you are and buy good stuff like suboxone or morphine or Oxycontin whatever tickles your fancy. You pay more but get the good stuff.

That way circle just sees you transferred then - you sold them for a few extra dollars to someone else, you don't know what they did with them.   But don't send coin from exchanges to markets. I'm not big myself on tumbling but I at least create a multibit wallet, wait a few hours, then send to market. I appreciate markets that give you a new address after every transaction and I send round numbers, then deposit the change into another one immediately. I never leave less than a hundred bucks or so on circle and j wait a few days before mocknf my change into my new ""to market"" account.   I'm not a huge DNM buyer but I understand blockchain well enough that those are quite sufficient steps to obscure transactions, and likely too much.   There are just too many hurdles to ""catch"" people via blockchain - articles about arrests will almost always say ""blockchain analysis proved fruitless.""  It's just not how people are caught.

I will then create a new LBC account not linked to me personally for future BTC purchases and operate from new LBC ->  intermediary  wallet -> dnm in future.  My past transfers from LBC to Agora will be linked but I shouldn't worry as blockchain is to difficult to investigate to make a connection to me personally.

DarkNetMarkets,3e11lo,Trashhhhhhman,2,Tue Jul 21 05:02:34 2015 UTC,How were the ripped?  Was it clean?  At the seams of each envelope?  Or torn?  It is possible it was simply damage during shipping. Or if inspected they didn't know what they were looking at. I assume it was obviously something not legal?  Cops wouldn't have knowingly let drugs through. Could it be a mail thief?  Checking to see if it were cash?  Of course why wouldn't they take drugs. Lol. You are probably okay. Did shipment take long time?  Did u check tracking?
DarkNetMarkets,3e11lo,Theeconomist1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:57:39 2015 UTC,"They were ripped completely at the top as if you were opening a letter.  Both envelopes.  Wasn't clean like a letter opening knife, it looked like by hand.  One larger white envelope and inside was a smaller white envelope, both letter size.  They were torn open all the way across the top.  And inside you could see a blister pack of the product.  Shipment was the usual time as I've ordered from this vendor before."
DarkNetMarkets,3e11lo,Theeconomist1,3,Tue Jul 21 04:06:43 2015 UTC,Well one guess then it's a thief who was quickly opening shit to see if it had some money or something valuable. Kind of like fuckers who target birthday or Xmas cards and steal money. If so he obviously thought the pills were of no value. Prob assumed they were vitamins bc who gets anything illegal thru the mail?  Lol. Anyway that's my best guess. LE prob would have opened with greater care id think. Plus they'd not let drugs pass thru unless u were moving serious weight and you were part of a larger investigation.

Stealth is the one area where scammers are well-ahead of trustworthy vendors. They absolutely love it.  It appeals to their deceptive nature. They see the stealth techniques of the best vendors because they buy their scam-bail from real vendors. Real vendors never get to shop for drugs on the darknet.

DarkNetMarkets,3dwwm5,Munchie_King,3,Mon Jul 20 21:15:50 2015 UTC,"First, this whole article is written for the international vendor audience and most if not all does not apply to domestic mail, especially depending on the product. For example, if your shipping USA domestic mushrooms, lsd, etizolam, xanax, GHB, etc you don't need all those excessive layers because dog aren't trained to hit on anything but mdmd/mdma smelling analogs, meth, heroin, weed, and coke. Of course we all know that doesn't really mean shit and a LEO has proven to be a lying sack of shit over and over again so he'll likely give his dog the command to alert no matter what in the package if he wants to see what's in it. And hand written labels aren't necessary within the states, I dgaf what anyone says, it just isn't.  For USA domestic stealth products that are NOT mdma/mdma analogs, coke, heroin, weed, or meth the minimal and adequate stealth is simple: vacuum sealed (to protect from the elements), a visual barrier (to protect from prying eyes or out layer puncture), AND MOST IMPORTANTLY electronic postage (most important). Stamps with tracking labels are getting noticed, electronic postage is totally unoticable. Printed labels are good because they ensure the sorting machines can read the address, but hand written labels is not a big deal. Again, this is all for shit that doesn't emit an odor that a dog will alert to. For those drugs, I'm in agreement that the vendor should go above and beyond and them some. But lets be real about dogs, they're not just walking dogs thru postal facilities all day every day. LE has a limited number of dogs and they are on the job with their handler ever day, it costs a five figure dollar amount to train a drug dog, and logistically it's just not possible to scrutinize even a minimal amount of any day's mail.   USPS is a bureaucracy, they're overworked, underpaid, and the vast majority of postal clerks and mailmen dgaf what is in your pack they just want to get the day's work done as fast as possible so they can stop counting beans and go home to their famililes for the 12 hours they have until they have to come back to work and repeat the cycle. Yea, they need a warrant to open a USPS pack, but we've got more than that on our side, we've got apathy and apathy is allot more predictable than a drug dog being run thru a postal facility at any random day.   Again I'm speaking USA domestic only. So people please for the love of god, stop demanding MBBs and mylar and printed labels if your shipping and receiving from within the states."

DarkNetMarkets,3dwwm5,Myhorseiswaytoohigh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:42:37 2015 UTC,"Yea, domestic shipping in the US is usually not a problem. This guide is catered towards international shipments. Far too often I've had bad experiences with new vendors shipping 125g parcels MDMA from either Netherlands, Germany, or Belgium in a zip only (you can imagine how nerve wracking this can be after securing a reliable drop). Since bulk MDMA is easier to manufacture overseas  due to easier access to precursors, it's also ridiculously cheap (if you have history with international vendors they'll often go as low as 10USD on large orders excess of 1kg). Once you smell the euphoric odor emitted from those Benjamins after no intercepts, you don't want to go back."

DarkNetMarkets,3dwwm5,MDPV_,0,Mon Jul 20 18:16:20 2015 UTC,"You should also talk about weights, the weight of every package also matters.  Anything above 13 ounces, if suspected contents are inside, customs may open it. Receiver of the package would have to pay extra postage fees and where they opened/cut will have tape on top saying ""customs""(or some sort).  Whereas if its under 365 Grams(total weight of package) is considered anonymous mail.  It would need some weeks to get warrants to open the package and by then, when they ask you to pay the extra postage people should already suspect it being tampered with on top of having to pay extra postage fees..  This information was given to me by post masters themselves. there is lots of more information about shipping anonymously but its all about who you ask, how you ask it, and also lots of research on forums."
DarkNetMarkets,3dwwm5,Acidland,2,Mon Jul 20 22:45:59 2015 UTC,"Yea, weight is very important too. We usually break down large shipments into seperate parcels ranging from 125g-250g. Never went above 250g because the financial risk didn't seem worth it. I'm talking about international though, domestic isn't a big problem. If you're distributing through campus or college town, it's extremely helpful having friends working in mail processing."

I've always associated dark runny wax with mediocre quality. It's purged well though? Correct me if I'm wrong, please.  I just got some shatter from PaulReuben on Alphabay, my second order from him, and I can't say enough good things about this guy. I'll be putting up a review later because I don't want to review it until I dab it, but it's translucent and light in color. It's pricier, but I don't want to be messing with underpurged wax with neuro toxins or whatever, besides it's personal use so I'd want the best.   I apologize if this comes off dick, but I've generally only read less than stellar things about HF's wax/shatter, but maybe this is all you have to base your judgements and comparisons on?

The picture in the slick does nothing near to justice. It was not mushy and gooey at all.   My mistake, I was really hung up on being as honest as possible and relaying my complete disappointment with the order from chroncentrates.  As far as HF, we've had his crumble only. Skywalker og strain, we like it, I am not going to say its top of the line because its $39 a gram. To me, its a fair price quality ratio.   In regards to HF in all honesty I avoided him for the past couple years, all I remember is reading bad stuff about him. I gave him a shot a few months back, and while I hate the slower ship time I have to say he generally makes up for it because everything is overweight.

What I got from this is that they have used a rip of the Evolution design for the market, hence why it is almost exactly the same with a similar theme.  I have identified no particular similarities that stood out to me from the headers and the file directories are completely different, yes this could easily be changed around, but the system doesn't seem to run the same at all.

DarkNetMarkets,3dy129,jamesbond123456,4,Mon Jul 20 13:54:24 2015 UTC,"The most popular vendors on Nucleus were affected. They are reporting on the forums that they are unable to login to Nucleus and that their PGP keys have been changed. Mass amounts of BTC have been reported to be moving out of Nucleus addresses, and the administrator failed to respond to questions whether these were internal wallets or hacker addresses.  This information is all gathered from vendors and users posting on the Nucleus forum.  Whether exit scam or hack, I am leaning towards a hack, this is a serious security breach. It was serious enough for vrc to take Nucleus down until the vulnerability was patched. He posted yesterday stating everything was resolved, but the vendors are still locked out of their accounts. He has not been online since yesterday according to his profile on the forum.  As /u/The_Fire_Bird said on another Nucleus thread. If you fuck with the vendors then you are going to have a bad time. Nucleus can (and I argue, has) scammed buyers repeatedly for months now, but the vendors have been untouched. This will be a decisive moment because reputable vendors have been affected.

The most I've taken is 1 mg and now I don't really care to take more than half a tab (.5 mgs) because it's still really visual especially with a bit of weed.

DarkNetMarkets,3dxwy3,-lobali,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:25:40 2015 UTC,"it may be. or it may be just how some offices handle tracking calls. because when i call about a package, and i give them my address, i get nothing more than, ""its here"", or ""its not, here. express isnt coming today, and no more mail drops today - everything has been  sorted"". but i get no info beyond that. they look nothing up; they are physically looking for my mail. any further status of package i think i have call ASK-USPS.  for reference, i'm in a relatively small town myself where they are rural routes. but the tiny towns have ""downtowns""."

It was express and I missed the cutoff but due to my location we have extra outbound flights and about half my express mail that gets there by closing still makes it next day despite they added the guarantee for Friday noon when I dropped it off at 4pm (2pm was cutoff) It just seemed odd that it didn't make the next few flightss and they apologetically explained it ended up in a priority bin with Friday's date although they typically do try to make next day.

A bit pissed at Synestter because he broke a promise, but I am confident he will make things right.   Some advice, take it or leave it. Kratom. It is excellent for heroin withdrawal. You can buy it legally in the USA from the site Herbal Salvation. I suggest the Meung Da (spelling)  strain. Also, if you can get a doctor to prescripe it, get some gabapentin. Its not a controlled substance, but you need a script for it, however, due to being non controlled, doctors are quick to give it up. Drink lots of water, you probably already know this, it helps big time. And of course, if you can get your hands on a little bit of suboxone, that can help as well. Just 4 or 5 days, taking as little as 1-2mg (very low dose) can really help in the long term. You can buy one strip on Agora for $20-25, which is 8/2mg. Cheers. I hope we both can kick."

DarkNetMarkets,3dzxca,ThisCouldVeryWellSuc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:02:28 2015 UTC,"Understand. However, you do not need to go to your primary doctor for subs. In fact, most primary doctors will not even give you a referral. A friend of mine, that is in the public eye mind you, went to a clinic to see a doctor that just specializes in opiate addiction and sleeping disorders. The only requirement needed was to test positive for heroin, and have the obvious look of a junkie. After that he got a script for suboxone (a one month supply so like 25 8/2mg strips) and was able to ween himself off of a 2 year habit he had been hiding. It was all kept quiet.  The downside to this is no insurance will cover it. It's all dollars with these people. The first vist + script was $525. Everytime after that it's around $350. However, he only needed to see him once and was done with it. No other doctors were ever notified, insurance was not involved, and the PMA is also not informed.   But it sounds like what you are doing is working. So you keep doing it. There is no need to take it to a higher level if you have a solid treatment plan down. AA/NA meetings can help a lot afterwards as well.   Good luck mate, I hope you make it."

I don't think they'll use a locker since those are usually limited in number and they need those for big packs.  I don't know if its standard, but mine would put a note in your box telling you they had your mail at the front I don't think anything.

Shades sent me a small sample of the second batch, which is the same quality. It looks a bit different though: the shards are a bit bigger. Colour and quality is the same imo!  Hes a super friendly vendor and answers in no time. I can recommend him as a Keta vendor and will order again soon.  keep the good work up shades! cheers"

I haven't actually used Wallet explorer, never needed to so unsure on their methods but they probably have contributors who add the wallets to their directory and they will be labelled by market name, hence why you can simply enter the markets name into the URL for most of them."
DarkNetMarkets,3dyt61,Axaq,2,Mon Jul 20 17:24:34 2015 UTC,"Here is u/jstolfi explanation. Aleš's algorithm is very simple: if two addresses appear as inputs to the same transaction, it assumes that they belong to the same wallet. That is because normally one needs to have both private keys to sign the transaction. His ""wallets"" are clusters of addresses,such that all addresses in a cluster are connected by a path of one or more of these links, and there is no connection between any two addresses in different clusters. (In mathematicall language, they are the equivalence classes of the reflexive,symmetric, and transitive closure of the ""appear together"" relation; or the connected components of the ""appear together"" graph.) Some of those ""wallets"" can be identified with famous entities by addresses that were published somewhere, or by experiment (send a few satoshis to Bitstamp, and wait for that receiving address get merged into some big wallet). The algorithm can fail in two ways. If BitPay (for example) has some receiving addresses that were never merged with the others, those addresses will appear as an separate wallet with a nondescript numeric ""name"". (For that reason, in fact, each time the database is rebuilt some wallets may gain ""new"" transactions that happened arbitrarily far in the past.) The other possible failure is that one can issue a transaction where the inputs belong to two different people, each signing his part of the transaction. The CoinJoin service does that all the time. For that reason, most of the addresses that were used with CoinJoin ended up in one humongous wallet, which Aleš called ""MtGOXandOthers"" before he knew what it actually was."

It seems so unnatural, and cruel in a kind of way. But RevenantChild is selling weed from south africa that is growing there in the ground since 1000s of years. It lacks the beutiful fluffy resin look, the potency, smell etc. of the ""overbred"" strains. But it feels more natural. For me it is like eating a hamburger made on a farm instead of eating mcdonalds burgers. Plus he is a nice guy, and emphasizes that his weed lacks the positive things that I mentioned above, which is another plus for me. And dont get me wrong his Durban Poison is fine, just probably around the 10-15 % THC region, which is another positive thing for me cause I am not a big smoker. Oh one more thing.

But I've come on here and asked the same sort of questions. It's not like you instantly know what to do just because you are involved with this stuff. He has a product, or will have a product, that he wants to sell, let him do it. I don't get why people have to be jerks.  I'd do it myself too but right now I don't have enough funds to start that up.  Anyways here is as much as I know.   Tails is always recommended over here, and as a buyer you might be fine with just using tor but I usually do tor + vpn. But yeah as a vendor, the best protection would be by buying a laptop in cash, installing tails, and then use tor+vpn. There are a few different ways to ship, but you should never have to go in the post office. You can go inside, but you have a way higher risk of getting caught since you are on camera. Basic way is to just grab a flat rate priority box, and take it home(free because you pay for it in the shipping cost). You put the stuff inside, and then you can pay with stamps I believe, or I have seen other vendors use ""Click n Ship"" or things like that where you print out a piece of paper with all the info and the postage is already paid. That being said, you would have to get money onto USPS website and I'm not sure if they would take a preapid card or not. The advantage of using this is that you can get tracking. If you choose to pay with just stamps, you don't get tracking. What people use instead if Tracking Label 400. There are some available on the markets but I have never bought them. They are hard to find at post offices, and even harder to actually obtain. The benefit of this is that it has a predetermined tracking number that you stick to the box and therefore have a tracking number and then it can still be scanned for trackking without going inside.   Wrote this kinda quick but that's baically as much as I know. I hope this helps, ask me for anything else, and good luck!"

Top_Gear_UK is one of the largest vendors for L with very little bad reviews(must from schills). I have an F/E order of 25x200ug that was shipped out yesterday.  I ordered DoctorAlice's 10x160ug and have a second order of 10x100ug from Cali-Connections being filled now. I have done reagent test on both DoctorAlice and Cali-Connection tabs and both test came out clean. While a little more expensive than some of the competition both these vendors were quick and awesome to work with.

If I was trying to find evidence for someone having ordered something I would encode an unique ID into the selection and order of words I put into ""love letters"".  Doesn't have to be too complicated because you can reuse IDs after some time has passed. And it's not very expensive to automate either. You only have to define legally necessary and optional text elements and you can have the software which produces these letters anyway assign each case the ID and encode it into them.  I won't guess on the probability of such measures being taken. All I'm saying is it is possible and easy to implement. And when you're trying to protect yourself from bad guys you should always assume that they're using every trick they can - especially when dealing with this kind of mafia which has access to virtually unlimited funds."

DarkNetMarkets,3dww4j,HofmannsHeir,2,Mon Jul 20 15:22:01 2015 UTC,"Have you vaped bud before?  It's similar to that - whether indica or sativa I find that you skip that kinda heavy/stoney phase that can hit for a little bit not long after you smoke.  Mostly felt effects in my head which is also due to this being a sativa (Jack Herer), but there's definitely a difference in the high.    It's also not as potent per puff and I'd say the high tends to wear off faster, but that's not as much of an issue since this thing is stealthy and portable.    If given the option, I still prefer to smoke over anything else - but if vaping like this was my introduction to pot I may have never tried smoking."
DarkNetMarkets,3dww4j,TheDankJournal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:30:46 2015 UTC,"""so if someone were curious enough to Google it they'd figure it out pretty quickly""  Unless, that someone can't spell, and now thinks you have herpes ; ) I loved the wire, and see the connection. I was telling my friend about thc e-cigs, and he was asking me about the smell? I assume the vapor smells like vaped bud or just bud? It's not something you can use in front of people, but say 20-30 yards away?"
DarkNetMarkets,3dww4j,peacockvapor,2,Mon Jul 20 09:35:57 2015 UTC,I have walked around Las Vegas Casino's with pen.   Sent in my house and smoke it all day. Nobody smells anything.   I have sat at my desk at a large Corp grabbing a hit every hour or so never an issue.   To me this is the real value. No smell and no smoke. Otherwise I prefer to just bong.

DarkNetMarkets,3dv320,thegallantone,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:52:31 2015 UTC,"Mdma lasts way shorter than acid, and acid has a much longer comeup than mdma. If you're really going for a true candyflip where you're peaking on both simultaneously then you should take the mdma about 90 mins after your acid. Really start to peak on both at about 2:30 into your acid trip. If you take your molly first you'll already be past your peak by the time the acid hits in full force. Take your MDMA much later than 3 hours into your trip and your roll will just kinda play with the comedown of your acid, not the peak. Still fun. Just don't take your mdma first."

DarkNetMarkets,3dwayw,BigASchw,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:51:54 2015 UTC,Psilocybin is the active alkaloid in Magic Mushrooms. Psilocybe is a Genus that encompasses many but not all species of Magic Mushrooms.
DarkNetMarkets,3dwayw,Nonya_B,-2,Mon Jul 20 02:25:48 2015 UTC,"And Psilocin is the 4-HO analouge of 4-Phosphate, both are found in mushrooms. Both are yummy!   So go with the Psilocybin friend!"
DarkNetMarkets,3dwayw,hog_master,2,Mon Jul 20 03:11:22 2015 UTC,"It should also mention that psilocybin is a prodrug for psilocin, so they're pretty much equivalent.  If you're not familiar with prodrug, it means that your bodies enzymes convert the original chemical into a different product, in this case psylocibin is de-phosphorilated into psilocin I believe."
DarkNetMarkets,3dwayw,CHNO28,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:41:22 2015 UTC,"More technically, your body does that to the majority of drugs, just that in the case of prodrugs, it's relatively/mostly inactive compared to the chemical you're actually taking the drug for.  The difference is subtle but important: 1) generally, the molecule loses mass, meaning you have to take more prodrug than direct drug and 2) generally, there are rate-limiting steps and metabolism is required for activity so it will take longer to feel the effects. Psilocybin isn't a huge concern for either of these, but other prodrugs like 4-AcO-DMT (same active metabolite) will take considerably longer.  Slightly off topic, this is kinda the opposite of DMT where it's already in active form but your body breaks it down too rapidly to take orally.  Back to OP: idk, it might be psilocybin extract, it might be psilocybe spores or it could just be inconsistent/bad terminology. If the psilocybe are good mushrooms, just get that; if you want more accurate dosing and psilocybin is extract (or would rather have a tiny packet of powder instead of an ounce of plant matter delivered) then go for that."

DarkNetMarkets,3dwayw,hog_master,2,Mon Jul 20 13:55:08 2015 UTC,"It's not really theory about how they work, rather the differences can be explained in terms of onset, local concentration, etc. As far as psychedelics in general, we only know the areas of activity but little about the psychological mechanisms themselves. For example, if you buy into the theory of them being feedback loops, a small difference in onset would cascade into a very different experience.  EDIT: another note is that 4-Acetoxy-DMT may be slightly hallucinogenic on it's own, but the primary effects are 4-HO-DMT"

DarkNetMarkets,3dvq2u,The_Grid_Is_Up,6,Sun Jul 19 23:21:00 2015 UTC,Lol. Exactly. The general rule I've learned with opioids is that you are always 2-3 days short. It never fucken fails. I could order a few hundred for N days and it'll last N-2 days.
DarkNetMarkets,3dvq2u,Theeconomist1,2,Mon Jul 20 02:49:26 2015 UTC,Haha I'm glad my DoCs aren't physically addicting. Though this phenibut is. For some reason I forsee it becoming a problem...

It's almost a complete waste of time keeping those part time jobs because they barely pay your bills, you're still late/missing payments, and you're taking up valuable time you could be using to find another job.  What kind of skills do you have? What are you trying to do for work (assuming probably anything at this point, yeah?). If you're tech savvy, have you tried learning basic system admin stuff? Help desk jobs pay an alright wage, IME anywhere from $10-15/hr for entry level stuff. If you think you'd like the software/creation side of things instead, try teach yourself programing. If you're interested check out sites like: http://codecademy.com, https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram, http://code.org/learn, or https://www.coursera.org/course/programming1.

I was a hobbyist, never made anything bigger than a personal blog on Wordpress and I built a bullshit resume that got me a job with a web development company and that's spun into an entire career.   At least I don't have kids or pets I can't afford to take care of or anything   Funny you say that. Lying on my resume and in the job interview was actually a hail mary for me. I knew that this is what I wanted to do for a living and I knew I could do it, I just didn't have the professional experience yet.

DarkNetMarkets,3dtk7g,Vendor_BBMC,2,Sun Jul 19 16:06:16 2015 UTC,"There was I. Just minding my own business, having a quick read of reddit after getting in from the shops.   ""Bitball Jackpot Winner!!""  ""OK...Some self-promoting scammer is announcing the winner of a prize draw - on the darknet, where the winner, the selection method and the prize are completely unverifiable"" I thought. ""I'm intrigued. I suppose it won't hurt to take a quick look""   ""Oh. I'm confused. I thought Grams / Helix were legit? Nothing depends on trust quite as much as a bitcoin tumbling / mixing service. Even complaints made by throwaway accounts can hurt them, if there are enough of them over a sustained period. And throwaways have zero credibility!""  ""Winning a competition you never entered is something that old people fall for. Could this be Nigerian?"". So I had a look for a tell-tale spelling mistake, because a real competition winner press announcement wouldn't have one.  ""I know some of you are very scepitcal and might think this is a shill post to promote bitall, bo I am posting the transaction ID of the payment""  A couple of typos there, (and misspelling ""BitBall"" doesn't auger well), but it doesn't feel Nigerian somehow. You WOULD expect people to be skeptical though, wouldn't you? Because the person who runs Grams Helix wouldn't try to prove a competition winner with a bitcoin transaction ID between two anonymous bitcoin addresses.  Everybody seems to be lapping it up, telling Grams he rocks. They must be familiar with the workings of this ball-based bitcoin raffle, and have seen a youtube video of the machine which selected this - ""the first 4-ball winner"".  ""Smells like bullshit, Redbook. But let it slide. Don't say anything""  I tried. I really did. Only......  ......I really wish ""gramsadmin"" hadn't just casually ended with ""Stay Safe""  ""exit-scam-from-the-beginning"" vendors always say something creepy like ""stay safe"" or ""be careful, people"" at the end of their profile. Its meant to reassure you that the two of you are on the same side against the bad guys. Kinda like the police Sergent in ""Hill Street Blues"" who  says ""Be careful out there, people"".  Its a darknet psychopath ""tell"", that is about as reassuring as adding the words ""to DIE for"" to the end of any sentence. In a Dr Evil voice. Followed by a little chuckle.  ""Is that an EVIL petting zoo, Scott?""  Its probably nothing. I'm sure that when you visit Grams, you will like it so much that (...pause) YOU WILL WANT TO STAY (...pause, followed by a little laugh) FOREVER....."
DarkNetMarkets,3dtk7g,LoudRooster,2,Sun Jul 19 21:58:33 2015 UTC,"Shame they don't get enough business to donate to the TOR foundation.

Vendors seem to be sticking with it though, for some reason (apart from the vendor who used to run ""Cannabis Road Marketplace"" which, if I'm not mistaken, was a scam from the beginning).  Maybe Bitcoinfog should run a lottery, then you would all be fighting to see who can kiss its ass the most.  Time to put a T chirt on. Its getting chilly in here."

Several vendors and users, big and small, are confirming funds out of the site.  your agenda against nucleus is strange, please stop this bs, if you like the community, if not continue do what you are paid to do."
DarkNetMarkets,3dyf6l,32323D20,4,Mon Jul 20 15:47:13 2015 UTC,Which Agenda? Everything I said is verifiable. And I am actually a vendor on Nucleus (albeit not affected) who is looking for some clarity on these issues.
DarkNetMarkets,3dyf6l,instrument_seeker,-5,Mon Jul 20 15:54:35 2015 UTC,"screaming scam or fear mongering is definitely not gonna give you answers.   if you are a vendor, your funds is in tact, the site functions like normal, why do you care? once admin or hacker steal funds, its too late to react, because its done before you notice."
DarkNetMarkets,3dyf6l,instrument_seeker,7,Mon Jul 20 15:59:52 2015 UTC,"why do you care?   Because people should be informed about market hacks and the lack of information coming from the staff after such an event. If after SR1, Sheep, EVO (etc..).....you still haven't learned about shit like this your market deserves very little respect. Stuff like this is the biggest deal breaker in the book. Shape up or ship out."

DarkNetMarkets,3dyf6l,Jay-__,6,Mon Jul 20 16:12:08 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing being a ""known user"" on the Nucleus forums translates into being a court jester. Are you seriously asking me why it is important for the staff to come clean after a market hack?"

DarkNetMarkets,3dveyu,Yourconscious69,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:18:30 2015 UTC,I consider opening a PO box with a fake identity kinda useless and eventually more  harmful in the end. If they find a package otw to your PO box they will control deliver to your PO box then you will get an extra charge for identity theft or something like that.

DarkNetMarkets,3dunyg,the_livings_easy,11,Sun Jul 19 17:25:04 2015 UTC,"Wait, so he won't ship until you've left 5 stars? If feedback is editable after the fact, I'd say no problem. If it's not editable than that's bullshit because he could be fishing for a 5-star and not even send out a re-ship. He could easily claim that it was shipped/intercepted/you're lying about not getting it, etc.  I appreciate vendors who will do what it takes to make the customer happy, but this doesn't seem like one of those times."

DarkNetMarkets,3dunyg,lemonbreak,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:59:48 2015 UTC,though feedback can be editted up to 6 weeks after its left   Is this true for all the markets? I haven't ever needed to change feedback after I've left it so I've never looked into it.
DarkNetMarkets,3dunyg,inkhead1,2,Sun Jul 19 20:34:15 2015 UTC,"Nah I think just Agora. It's good though because if someone leaves bad feedback, a vendor can step in and try to fix it so that the buyer is happy and then they can change it so it doesn't ruin a 5/5 perfect feedback."
DarkNetMarkets,3dunyg,lemonbreak,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:28:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've always thought it would be helpful to be able to edit your own feedback. I see on here all the time a buyer says the package never arrived and end up getting it like weeks or months later for whatever reason (vendor fuckup, USPS fuckup, etc). It would be cool if someone in that situation were able to come back and update their feedback to say that it actually did arrive and it was because of X that it took so long.  Not too mention all the fuckboys that leave ""FE'd. Will update,"" then don't even have the ability to update later on, if they ever intended to in the first place."

I don't know why on here we never suggest the simplest way to resolve these things .   But message him. Say thank for reply and let him know you have no intention of feedblackmailing him. But you cannot leave any feedback or finalize the order until it has been resolved.   If he is willing to reship and asusuming it arrives no issues you will happily give him a 5/5 rating. If you dobt he can use this conversation to dispute thebfeedback with admins.  But you won't finalize a rate an order you haven't received.

There is no ""review scams"" obviously if your order goes through you have no reason to leave a negative review. That being said, Agora will let you change the review afterwards, but I think the vendor is just trying to make the good reviews stay around as long as possible. Do the community a service and leave a 0/5 review now, with ""will update if package goes through"" message."

You have an insane amount of info about Top_Gear's business, and while this isn't unusual in and of itself it is bizarre when coupled with the way you attack every vendor in every thread that isn't Top_Gear. No one does that because they enjoy it as you say, or because they care so much about people getting ""ripped off"". If you did really care you wouldn't accuse everyone who disagrees with you of being a rival vendor. That behavior is borderline psychotic, and it syncs up with the way people say Top_Gear behaves when they message him with complaints. Your ruse is so transparent that it's laughable. Oh, and go ahead and accuse me of being a rival vendor. So who do you think I am? BV? GG? Well I'm female so I must be HoS or AtomicLove.

I had to explain that Gwern likes to joke around. ""Click the link. Do you think everybody would be wishing him bon voyage if he had really cracked up and dumped gigabytes of evidence where LE can access it? He was still asking for ""marketplace scrapes"" as recently as yesterday""  I have to admit, it gave me pause for thought. Everybody is congratulating him, for being so fastidious in his documentation of their online criminal activity. Maybe this is the best thing ever, because his research will enable us all to improve our OPSEC, and get away with all of our guilty history - totally scot-free. Somehow, the slate will be wiped clean, there will be no evidence of our drug buying and selling, and Gwern Branwen will go down in darknet history as a great hero.  I tried to picture this in the real world, because sometimes things are difficult to picture if they are ""online"". So here we go:-  Imagine Gwern standing outside a crack dealer's house, noting what was on offer every day, seeing who goes in and out, how long the place operated for, and taking the dealer's fingerprints / PGP key (to link him to crack dens in other cities).  Try to picture Gwern in an Italian restaurant, wearing a wire and doing a ""scrape"" of every bit of crime-related gossip, knowing that the made-guys use the restaurant as a kind of venue (or ""forum"" if you will) for narcotic-trade discussion.  If Gwern were technically-minded, he could place a microphone in every forum, and keep a tally of how much of each drug was sold by every drug dealer, along with 2 lines of testimony from every one of their customers that the drugs crossed borders, or didn't arrive, or ""FE for trusted vendor. Will update""   Offline, the crack dealer might tap on Gwern's car window, and  politely ask him what he was writing. ""Oh, just calculating how much crack you've sold, anywhere. Since 2009. Its for my thesis""  ""Don't worry. I would never talk to a reporter""  ""Reporter? Ha ha ha! Its a good job I know you are joking. Otherwise, I would kill you""  That's OK then. Good luck with your degree. But not a word of this must ever get out. You know what happens to grasses""  ""Of course not. This will go to the grave with me. I would never talk to the police. They could get a subpoena for all I care, they will never see a megabyte of the dirt I have on you and your customers""  ""Can you imagine if I ever released my portfolio of criminal evidence publically? It would be used in every drug trial in every country, putting people behind bars for thousands of extra years, and earning the feds millions in asset forfeiture. It would be the biggest disaster in darknet history, worse than the seizure of the Silk Road server""  ""If there was ever a movie about the darknet, I would be played by John Malkovich""  Good luck to Gwern Branwen - still cracking those April fools jokes right to the end. But don't forget how you all shat yourself when you thought the police had subpoena'd his ""research""? I thought he was starting to crack up the last couple of weeks. I can always tell when I'm being lied to, and I was afraid he was going to do something stupid.  The fact you're all wishing him well rather than threatening to kill him reassures me that everything is alright, and the evidence is safe. (I don't like to click on links in Reddit). Gwern didn't become the darknet's first international supergrass. But I admit I panicked there for a moment. I nearly clicked on the link, half expecting to see it all there in black and white. But remember this:- Do you know for sure that Gwern is a great guy? What if he started asking for bitcoin contributions from our community? He could land every vendor and customer who ever used a darknet marketplace in the shit if he wasn't such a stand-up guy. It would only take one stolen copy to get out and he will have bombed darknet markets back to the stone age.  Just out of interest, has anybody clicked the link to see what's Gwern REALLY made public? I bet it was a single pdf file containing the words ""Fuck you, police!

DarkNetMarkets,3dtcrl,Hank_Vendor,2,Mon Jul 20 01:14:42 2015 UTC,"its not. its sickening when people say ""gwern has helped this community so much"" noo he has exploited it for his own personal gains. he doesn't give a shit about DNM, tor, anything. Ulbricht got life the ""buzz"" is dying so he does this shit and onto his next project. maybe he should run for president he seems to have what it takes to fuck over the masses while they remain oblivious to it"
DarkNetMarkets,3dtcrl,Vendor_BBMC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:31:49 2015 UTC,Well said.   Pretty much what I am thinking.
DarkNetMarkets,3dtcrl,XeroxSnowman,4,Tue Jul 21 13:59:19 2015 UTC,"If he really DID crack up and dump evidence of everything we ever said, bought or sold since the early days of Silk Road where they can be used as evidence in criminal trials, it would certainly put vendors who don't delete your shipping details into perspective!  Gwern was publicly questioning my judgement recently, like he's the DNM professional and I'm the amateur. Talking about banning me for asking him questions.  I've seen the way some men act when they suffer ""TOR fatigue"", and I was worrying that gwern was displaying all the symptoms. He was clearly suffering under the burden of the vast archive of potential evidence he had accumulated on every one of us. Its a heavy load for one man's shoulders.  I admit I was worried that he was cracking under the strain, but couldn't quite bring himself to keep it safe until the statute of limitations renders it inadmissible (in the US at least. In the UK, it could be used to prove what I sold, and how much, for how long, even if I'm 90 when they kick my door in).   Sometimes I think I'm a better judge of character than I really am. I thought gwern was losing it and about to do something stupid without thinking it through.   Somebody has to document history, and it should be preserved for future generations. I tried to discourage gwern from retiring. But the more I think about it, the more I understand why gwern had to get out. Now, while he still can.  If his data ever leaked, it could set the darknet marketplace community back 5 years. He's worked so hard on it that it must be killing him knowing that he can never show it off without severely endangering current marketplace users. But in particular, vendors.  At least I could hand his marketplace scrapes to my accountant so he can calculate my back taxes if drugs are ever legalized!"
DarkNetMarkets,3dtcrl,CocaineNose,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:28:34 2015 UTC,"If it was too much pressure, my first thought was just wipe away the archive, but I am not gwern so I don't know what went through his head"

DarkNetMarkets,3dtcrl,CocaineNose,2,Sun Jul 19 19:48:33 2015 UTC,"Gwern Branwen is an online alias he uses. They're characters from Welsh tradition; Gwern being the son of Matholwch the king of Ireland, and Branwen. I doubt it's his actual name though it would be interesting if it was."

DarkNetMarkets,3duft0,lemonbreak,3,Sun Jul 19 16:49:51 2015 UTC,"His feedback is great. I actually just placed the order. It's a risk, sure but I've been disappointed in my last several orders with vendors that I normally had no issues with. The dope scene on the darknet is bad right now"
DarkNetMarkets,3duft0,lemonbreak,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:16:58 2015 UTC,Yup IMHO it's been bad for a while. I was just talking yesterday about the hayday that was SR1.
DarkNetMarkets,3duft0,lemonbreak,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:19:06 2015 UTC,I started using the markets right before SR was closed. My hayday was on BlackBank. There were always vendors with good dope on there before Evo scammed and it got flooded with people.
DarkNetMarkets,3duft0,hog_master,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:24:34 2015 UTC,"The thing that separated SR1 from BlackBank wasn't dope quality, it was the overall vendor quality. The old school vendors seemed like they actually cared about you and you weren't just a useless junkie. They all used to answer messages quickly, every dope order except 1 out of the 400+ orders I made was shipped same day (or next morning if I made the order late at night), they all had exceptional shipping speed (all offered express) and stealth.  I mentioned it yesterday, but I had a vendor front me twice, without me even asking (just mentioning in passing on torchat that I was dopesick).  It was a hell of a time to be a dopehead man, I'll tell ya. I don't think the prices were as ridiculous as they are now. That shit started towards the end of SR1 I believe when Nod started colluding with other vendors to artificially inflate prices because they knew we'd pay whatever the price (at least the ones that weren't close to a local dope market). I just bought 3.5g locally last night for $180. I'm so glad I live near some IRL dope now lol."

DarkNetMarkets,3dtv78,hog_master,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:01:12 2015 UTC,"I agree without.   But I don't think 2c-b has a steep dose response curve, nothing like heroin.   I've pushed it to 40 mg and had some of the best experiences of my life.   Even taking 30 mg is amazing."
DarkNetMarkets,3dtv78,The_Grid_Is_Up,2,Sun Jul 19 13:10:49 2015 UTC,"This is true, but it's active in a low milligram range. For most  people 30 would be uncomfortable lol. I know 25 was pretty intense for me lol. It's true though, some drugs have a much steeper curve (like heroin and Moxy). Moxy is definitely the steepest I've encountered."
DarkNetMarkets,3dtv78,hog_master,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:14:32 2015 UTC,"I will agree with this. Anything active in the 10-20mg range is surely some potent shit!   Can you elaborate more on Moxy and it's dose/response curve? I've never fucked with it, and honestly after experiencing 5-MEO-deems I really have no desire to, as that was a pretty damn intense experience and also a very potent substance, but I would like to hear about it!"
DarkNetMarkets,3dtv78,The_Grid_Is_Up,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:13:33 2015 UTC,"Moxy is chemically related to 5-MeO-DMT, but the experience is not even close. I'm gonna use GWL's pre-dosed capsules as a frame of reference since he seems to have it down: one capsule (7-9mg) produces an MDMA like effect (along with the tryptamine body high), while two (only 14-18mg) will produce a full-blown psychedelic ride just like LSD. That's a pretty sharp curve lol. Amazingly versatile substance though."
DarkNetMarkets,3dtv78,hog_master,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:36:20 2015 UTC,"Damn that is a sharp curve! I love the tryptamine body buzz, so nice.   Is the full blown moxy trip more similar to the 4-substitued tryptamines like 4-acetoxy, 4-ho, and 4-PO3 DMT? The tyrptamine class really blows my mind in how versatile and different they can be from one another, even acid from shrooms. DMT from 5-meo-dmt, and now Moxy from LSD."
DarkNetMarkets,3dtv78,The_Grid_Is_Up,2,Sun Jul 19 15:39:26 2015 UTC,"I don't have huge psychedelic experience, but IMO it was indistinguishable from LSD. I'd say it compared to about a 150ug trip just with a much shorter duration, and slightly less of a mindfuck. Crazy visuals though!"
DarkNetMarkets,3dtv78,Chetineva,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:45:15 2015 UTC,"Would you say it's necessary to take two at the same time? I tried taking two from GWL but the doses were spaced apart by about 1.5 hours, and I was pretty disappointed overall. Kinda trippy, yeah, but not 'psychedelic' in my book."
DarkNetMarkets,3dtv78,hog_master,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:44:38 2015 UTC,"IME with psychs, if you don't dose all at once, you will not get the combined dose experience you are looking for, but rather an extended duration of time."
DarkNetMarkets,3dtv78,The_Grid_Is_Up,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:47:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah if you wait that long they won't really stack. Two at the same time will produce that effect, but I'm sure individual body size etc would affect it. For instance I only weigh like 120lbs."
DarkNetMarkets,3dtv78,Chetineva,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:47:57 2015 UTC,"That's also been my experience, I always forget how quickly tolerance with psychs builds.

DarkNetMarkets,3dtv78,The_Grid_Is_Up,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:05:15 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed the effects of one capsule, so I decided to try two. This was a bad idea. Not because of the substance itself, but because I ignored the cardinal rule of psychedelics. I was dealing with a lot of stress and anxiety in my personal life, and the Moxy took that and ran with it like any psychedelic would. I managed to avoid having a total disaster of a trip (I was calmed down by the thread I posted in this sub lol), but it was rough for about an hour and a half. Moxy is great, just don't underestimate it lol."

Never underestimate the psychs, true friend! Even if you have taken it a hundred times before, this time can and will be different.  So awesome that this forum was able to get you through it! Great place here."
DarkNetMarkets,3dtv78,LedLevee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:45:06 2015 UTC,"Steep dose curve means that 2mg extra can give you quite a different trip, as opposed to 10mg MDMA not really making a difference."
DarkNetMarkets,3dtv78,hog_master,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:15:31 2015 UTC,"I see what you are saying. So things like Dillaudid, Xanax, Fentanyl, etc. I really don't think there is a huge difference between 10 and 12 milligrams of 2cb, however some may disagree with me.  However, there is a huge difference between 2mg and 4mg of dillaudid. Even between 2 and 4 of xanax."
DarkNetMarkets,3dtv78,Chetineva,3,Sun Jul 19 15:20:51 2015 UTC,"Well.. That has more to do with potency than dose/response. 2mg of Dilaudid is already quite active, so naturally doubling that dose up to 4mg will have a significant effect. Drugs are active at different doses, and so comparing 2mg of one to another just doesn't work. It's all about the ratio.   MDMA has a steep dose/response curve as well. A 25% increase in dose, say 100mg to 125mg, will feel like a lot more than an extra 25mg."
DarkNetMarkets,3dtv78,LedLevee,2,Sun Jul 19 15:51:13 2015 UTC,"I don't notice myself very much either. Just the body sensation goes up a lot (as well as the bodyload during the come-up), but honestly 18 or 20mg, doesn't matter much for me.   Of course 15 vs 20 does matter a lot, so it is a decently precise drug."

DarkNetMarkets,3dtv78,LedLevee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:15:17 2015 UTC,"I always weigh with a little metal ""pan"" or whatever, that comes with the scale. This is because I doubt my scale is accurate below 10mg. I read somewhere on some scale/weighing forum (nojoke) that it'll be more accurate if you weigh 50mg of the metal ""pan"" and 20mg of substance than just the substance.   Explaining this poorly I think, but I mean that it'll be more accurate saying 68 or 69 than 18 or 19 mg."
DarkNetMarkets,3dtv78,hog_master,0,Sun Jul 19 15:16:43 2015 UTC,"All depends on the scale friend. Chemistry lab grade scales are certainly accurate in the 1-10mg range. I also think that most gunpowder grade scales are. In my experience they have been accurate for sure in the 10-20 range and above, and even somewhat (will give you a very good idea) of the 5-10 range.   The triple beam (or tripley in french) is also a very accurate, analogue scale using weights and balances to obtain a very precise reading."
DarkNetMarkets,3dtv78,LedLevee,2,Sun Jul 19 15:42:20 2015 UTC,Ye I maybe should mention I googled my scale specifically.   So take with a grain of salt (200-300ug approx :))

DarkNetMarkets,3drlui,hog_master,6,Sun Jul 19 03:30:44 2015 UTC,Personally I don't think it matters that a movie talks about Darknet like that. I'd say a large portion of people that will see this movie won't even believe that you can do something like that (buy and sell drugs) on the internet.  There is a ton of publicity about the Darknet as it is with regular media and news outlets so I don't think this is going to create any surge in publicity or anything.
DarkNetMarkets,3drlui,saudimise_the_saudis,2,Sun Jul 19 12:57:04 2015 UTC,"This is a good point.   Also, besides, they didn't link to an actual working market.

It's not just download these two softwares, pop in this URL, and go to this bank. I mean you need to learn pgp, how to not be fished, how to work as a whole community, and have fun!

The other thing is, someone could just make another movie which features DNM's, but in a more neutral light. For example, there are a lot of people using DNM's for health/therapeutic/medicinal purposes... Not everyone's doing recreation. From that angle, DNM's could be seen as a way for people to obtain high quality meds without the risk of low purity/contamination.... And then it can also touch on the insanity of prohibition, war on drugs, and war on consciousness (Here and Here), which are also directly related."

Next time ask if 84% mdma is pure . You wont see the end of it. Users tend to jump to battle at those kind of questions , its not you.  In my opinion the difference is listings come from alot of reasons. Precursors used , method of synthesis, lab set up ( I have seen some filthy labs ), what ever left over chemicals the mdma is left with after the sysnthesis , if it was washed to remove said impurities and I bet I havent tought of all the possibilities.   By using a reagent test kit , at least you can prove the susbtance is mdmX , at least to a degree since those dont test purity."

DarkNetMarkets,3dv35k,beakertube,2,Sun Jul 19 20:03:21 2015 UTC,"It's just a matter of whether the product is acetone washed and how the product is dehydrated and at what speed.  If you skip a hot acetone wash and crystallization at the end, you will end up with a brown, root beer colored product.  Opacity is determined by the speed of the crystallization.  If you wash it, you'll end up with various shades of white/champagne/tan crystals.  However, MDMA crystals are typically small, .25-.5g crystals.  In order to make those big moonrocks that you see sold by a lot of vendors, that is done by melting down MDMA and solidifying it as big blocks.  Depending on the previous color from a wash or lack thereof, you can end up with stuff that looks like hard caramel, or you can end up with more opaque tan or grey rocks.  But there is essentially no difference. The only thing that matters is the purity from the synthesis, but the rocks can come in many forms."
DarkNetMarkets,3dv35k,hog_master,0,Sun Jul 19 20:21:54 2015 UTC,There ain't no different type of MDMA. There is MDMA or there ain't. That simple.
DarkNetMarkets,3dv35k,Raising_TheBar,0,Sun Jul 19 20:36:07 2015 UTC,"MDMA has different forms it can exist in, it's technical chemistry stuff and depends on the method used to synthesize it.  I believe all the MDMA at our disposal is likely racemic, meaning a mixture of the forms.    Canadianforgers listings may be made using different methods that tend to leave different impurities in different quantities that are responsible for effecting the colour and strength."
DarkNetMarkets,3dv35k,hog_master,-1,Sun Jul 19 20:26:03 2015 UTC,"No, not the same thing.  And there are not different crystals of LSD or MDMA, they are the same molecule, just different %'s of purity.  Your naivety dumbfounds me."

You do not have an opiate dependency.  If you went to the doctor and told him or her your level of use, they would probably tell you that you don't qualify for suboxone. They all have lots of patients who need a 30mg just to feel   I was a very serious junky and managed to pull myself out of it with suboxone.  People here who say that ""suboxone is worse than opiates"" probably don't know what a real opiate habit it. It's waking up in a pool of sweat every morning because you haven't fixed in 8 hours. It's crushing up 5 of those 30mg Roxies and extracting the blue serum to IV ... in a parking lot.  It's being willing to chew your own arm off to get at some dope. You aren't there yet.  My advice:  just get off this road.  You already have a tiny taste of what opiate withdrawal is like and you don't enjoy it.  But you have just felt the tiny pin-prick of the tip of knife.

You can catch a buzz off 30mg?! How long and how often have you been using? No offense, but man up and go cold turkey. You might feel a little bit under the weather for a couple days, but that's probably about it.  I went cold turkey off of a 400mg/day oxy habit. I was a habitual user for 6 years and spent almost 10 months at 400mg/day never missing more than 2 days in a row.  Regardless you don't need suboxone and you don't need to taper either. Jump off right now where you're at. If you start to feel sick take 20mg-30mg of loperamide (Immodium AD). Wait about 30min-45min, if you don't feel better take 20mg more. That should alleviate most of the worst symptoms. Take ibuprofen for any aches/pains."

One sub 'strip' or 8mg subutex should last you about three days.  I would cut them into sixths and see how you feel.  They make most people that don't have a serious habit very sick.  It took my opiate naive friend about two days to feel better after taking about 1mg of subutex.  Check out r/opiates and r/opiaterecovery

I have quit opis many times and found the best way was to taper down as low as you can go and then go cold turkey. I would use some benzos (for only a week or so) for anxiety and sleep, gabapentin or lyrica for sleep, and I also would get some edibles to deal with the boredom. The edibles last long and help with the hot cold feelings rather than smoking a bowl every 2 hours. I recommend looking at the withdrawal kits on the darkwebs and getting some of Roses gardens edibles ( the gummies are the shit). The oxy withdrawals will suck bad for a few days but you will feel better much quicker than using subs to taper off them."

Also picked up a few other non addictive drugs to maybe add some spice to life like mdma, orange Tesla's, always have top grade MJ around, few Xanax...

I struggled and witnessed many others struggle with the same thing for many years and sub has kept me ""clean"" or off roxy for 4+ years. It worked for me and keeps me clean and functional. While I'll agree that 30mg is low but it's unfair for someone to say you don't have an opiate dependence and belittle your problem because it wasn't as big or bad as theirs. Go see an addiction dr that can prescribe subs and make a plan. Don't let dr reddit tell you what's best for you, go see a real dr. You can PM if you have any other questions."
DarkNetMarkets,3duuqc,hog_master,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:49:02 2015 UTC,"I can see where other people are coming from but like everything in life, each case and person is different. Like I said when I first started, whether it's because I have a low tolerance for opiates of what, literally a 1/4mg of a 5mg perc got me feeling good. I never took it to get that blasted or nodding off feeling, hated that actually and I knew I took too much at those points. I liked just that better mood, more energetic feeling from what seems to be lower doses....fast forward to now and it seems I never get that feeling anymore or it only lasts for 15-30 min and than followed by that tired or nodding feeling from I'm guessing taking doses in the 20-40mg range. My other issue is that for last 3-4 years I redose all day, probably every 2-4 hours so there are few moments in last year's where I wasnt on anything. Wake up and literally roll over to drop a 10mg before even get out of bed at 5am, another 15-20mg before walking into work at 7, another 15-30mg at 930, again @ 1230, 430 and so on...as you can see cost is hitting about 3-400 a week so thats killing me as well. The few times I have quit more so due to running out than actual desire to quit, 3-5 days of shittyness that physically got better but it was lack of mental stimulation that always leads me back. Like life is so boring and no ambition to do anything, even things that could be fun...I always think to myself, this would be even better if I was ""on"".

Get your body addicted to heroin for a week, then just gotta man up and go through withdrawal for a week. With suboxone all you are doing is making the misery longer and drawn out. The H or Oxy kick is like 3 days of shit and another 2-3 of kinda shit. Sub is like a few weeks of kinda shit."

DarkNetMarkets,3dt8em,888883333333,2,Sun Jul 19 16:39:04 2015 UTC,Does joinmarket have delays in place to break up transactions? does it standardize amounts to prevent size correlations? what does it do with the change amounts? Is it all on-chain or does it do some stuff off-chain? Who coordinates the mix?
DarkNetMarkets,3dt8em,sapiophile,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:36:44 2015 UTC,"A great starting place to learn about JoinMarket is here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=919116.0   Does joinmarket have delays in place to break up transactions?   Not inherently, no, because JoinMarket transactions are just single, ""normal"" Bitcoin transactions, so they are instant. However, one could replicate a centralized tumbler's delays by simply moving the coins you want to tumble into another address/wallet that you control for an arbitrary period of time before starting the JoinMarket process. And because JoinMarket is so cheap to use, one could send coins through multiple times manually (not automatically yet, unfortunately) with whatever delay you want inbetween each round. (Oh, and also, there is of course some ""delay"" between a JoinMarket ""Maker"" proposing a transaction and their partnering ""Takers"" actually accepting it, and then the short time it takes the scripts to coordinate the final transaction itself.)   does it standardize amounts to prevent size correlations?   Yes. The ""market maker"" specifies the standarized ""unit"" to be used for a given JoinMarket transaction, although I believe that it can be any amount you like. I think 0.1BTC is the most common unit.   what does it do with the change amounts?   That's actually a great question, and I can't answer it with confidence, but I assume that they are handled normally just like with any Bitcoin payment, since the actual Join transaction is just a regular Bitcoin payment. Of course, centralized tumblers don't do anything with change outputs, either. However, one could use a wallet that supports coin control and be a Maker of a JoinMarket transaction whose ""unit"" is equal to the exact output of one of your address's balance (or that balance minus tx fee), in which case there would be no change. However, that has some clear problems from a privacy perspective, if the balance is not a common one.   Is it all on-chain or does it do some stuff off-chain?   The transaction itself is entirely on-chain, but the real magic happens in the coordination between the ""Maker"" and ""Takers"" off-chain, using the JoinMarket scripts. However, throughout that whole process, no actual value is transfered at all - only encrypted portions of the final transaction itself.   Who coordinates the mix?   For each JoinMarket transaction, there is a JoinMarket ""Maker"" and one or more JoinMarket ""Takers"" - the Maker lays out the terms of the join (the base amount or ""unit"" of the transaction, their own small fee, and so on), but there is no overall ""coordinator"" for the process itself - it's done entirely peer-to-peer. [EDITED: One or sometimes more of the peers can, however, learn the source-destination mappings of the other participants in the transaction (see https://www.reddit.com/r/joinmarket/comments/3dv04i/since_all_the_participants_of_a_joinmarket/ )], but future innovations could prevent even this. Personally, I'm curious if it could be paired with something like CoinShuffle to prevent this in another manner, but that's getting into technicals that are over my head. Of course, if CoinShuffle had a working implementation at all, we probably wouldn't need JoinMarket in the first place...  I definitely encourage everyone to read more on JoinMarket, as it's a really great tool that solves a lot of the biggest problems with tumblers as we know them, and is probably the way of the future."

However I do have one complaint. The other day I was using the sendpayment.py script. The command was exactly:  Code:  python sendpayment.py -C -N 4 <wallet> 0 <address>  The script put the transaction together, and presented me with the options and a ""y/n"" prompt. I pressed ""y"" without paying too much attention and ended up paying some asshole 2.8 BTC to send a little over 5. Which is more than half of the bitcoin controlled by my privkeys.

Propionate and enanthate are 'esters', they are added to testosterone to extend the time it spends in your body (free testosterone has a half life of a few hours), and yes enanthate and cypionate are commonly used over propionate due to being significantly larger (thus longer-lasting) esters because this allows stabler blood levels for any given pinning frequency (current wisdom being that a 'standard blast' is best done with 250mg shots twice weekly, or every third day, of test E(nanthate) or C(ypionate))  regarding /u/Hamm-Sammich 's advice, please go and read there, before posting.

Is your gear fresh pharma or out-dated UGL? etc (don't answer those I'm just illustrating considerations when choosing a weekly dosage.  Keep in mind that it's common practice to take the weekly dosage split into two doses) And yes you need special things while using test (over&above sleep/diet/normal stuff), specifically you need something to handle gyno if it occurs (or even products to proactively manage estrogen before problems can occur), and you need something to get off cycle with ('pct' or post cycle therapy) if you intend to stop taking test."

DarkNetMarkets,3dtlub,mrgreencannabis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:28:01 2015 UTC,"I am sure.  People accept fat gain during 'bulking' periods in order to maximize muscle gain, in that they strive to always have a caloric surplus; this fat is shed during 'cutting', showcasing the muscle - not becoming muscle.    500mg (real/pharma) would be more than I'd start with at your size.  Something to keep in mind is that, past a certain point, your benefit:dosage ratio decreases as you increase dosage levels ie taking 1g won't give you twice the gains that 500mg would've.  Keeping it as low as is needed for a proper bulk is the name of the game here, and it's totally normal to find your sweet spot ends up in the 300's.  Obviously you could just take a 1g frontload and then go 500/wk, and hope for the best- hope you're not gyno prone, hope you don't shut down excessively, etc etc., but you're going to get more out of your gear using it at 'maximum efficiency' for your bulk while also reducing chances of sides.  This is the thrust of why people who use gear balk at newbies who want to use gear- there is a risk/reward ratio when considering using gear that, done properly, makes using it a no-brainer for many.  But, for many many newbies, the approach is to use too much in too-inefficient a manner, resulting in cycles with terrible risk//reward profiles (leading to more 'dissatisfied customers' which tends to give gear a bad rep, or at least this sentiment seems held by many vets who hate on newer trainees using steroids)"
DarkNetMarkets,3dtlub,dawgiee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:33:27 2015 UTC,Just be careful with any kind of steroid- the more it bulks you up the worse the side effects. Nearly all cause significant hair loss and extreme acne

DarkNetMarkets,3dulw6,The_Grid_Is_Up,-1,Sun Jul 19 19:42:58 2015 UTC,JoR and TGUK are the only suppliers of xtal. Everyone on the DNM selling LSD are getting from one of them be it directly or indirectly. No one speaks out against JoR because there was no other show in town. He has by my count 10+ resellers who would fall on their sword for him because he is the puppet master and he will turn the taps of if they speak out.  TGUK on the other hand is completely independent and is attack by his rivals since he hurt JoR's ego when he refused his offers. There are many people would love  TGUK out of the way and have good reason to discredit him. JoR is orchestrating this so TGUK doesn't completely put him outa business.
DarkNetMarkets,3dulw6,The_Grid_Is_Up,2,Sun Jul 19 19:53:46 2015 UTC,I don't get how you feel TGUK and JoR are so different. Both sell xtal. Both supply their umbrella of resellers. JoR is as independent as TGUK. The difference is JoR has more resellers and a larger business.
DarkNetMarkets,3dulw6,darknetkoon,-1,Sun Jul 19 20:00:13 2015 UTC,Believe me when I say TGUK is bigger. This is the main reason JoR set out to discredit TGUK. JoR threw the first punch after TGUK refused to join him in a price fixing deal and if TGUK would buy his crystal he would force all his resellers to use TGUK. JoR wants to be the big chief but it backfired. JoR is a Cry baby little bitch.

He has expressed that he likes the way I vend, as do all of my customers. (I say he, although I have no idea if it is he/she/it)  JoR no longer needs to front me because I have saved enough coins from vending his product on front to cover the prices now. Did I get 10g fronted... no, I was exaggerating I admit, it was only 5g. He saw my many orders 5/5 feedback and trusted me enough to send a sizable amount (500mg). After seeing how I did, and how I never strayed away from my path, he choose to trust me and doubled me up, then trusted me with 5g, to which I finished vending not long ago.   I can almost guarantee my price on front was lower than TGUK would offer me for FE payment. I don't know, I only asked him on my buyer account for a quote for 1g, which was higher than JOR price by about 30%. I'm not sure if TGUK would of fronted me. If he is such the great value LSD vendor, I'm sure he will message me on market and offer to do the same. Don't hold your breath.   I only answer these questions in respect for the person/people responsible for opening so many doors for me. It hurts me to see so much untruth about vendors who have decided to spread the light, especially one kind enough to trust in someone over a keyboard.   Also, I do not vend on TMG, I merely post their. I enjoy talking about psychedelics with anyone, sharing experiences and knowledge is a hobby of mine.

We aim to become the most transparent market with the most useful set of features.  We also will release a quite ingenious solution to the security of funds in escrow hopefully soon.  We are growing slowly but steadily so we are quite happy.  We are still beta after all. Stay tuned for the real launch in a few weeks.  Cheers!

DarkNetMarkets,3dsox5,hog_master,3,Sun Jul 19 14:03:28 2015 UTC,"Hierarchical deterministic wallet.  Allows on-the-fly generation of unique addresses for each transaction which is how the payment system there works.  As vendors, we get paid directly into our personal wallets.  No need to withdraw from the ""on-site wallet"" and no need for buyers to deposit before ordering either.  Basically, one of the best innovations to hit a DNM in a while."

DarkNetMarkets,3drc02,Useful_Idiot_DN,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:37:19 2015 UTC,"Actually there was a vendor (XanaxPharm) I dealt with who weeks later after my order had multiple scam reports on him, his vendor profile was under investigation for scamming and so I made the assumption that what I was hearing on reddit (of all places) was true, which led to me changing my feedback and sending some hatemail.  According to XanaxPharm, the whole ordeal was brought on by 1 crazy customer that was causing a huge commotion. That didn't seem believable enough at the time, although after a few messages back and forth and seeing that he was getting 5/5 ++rep reviews for many days following the accusations, I decided I would wait to see what Agora was going to do as far as a decision.  Reddit posts about XanaxPharm scamming: First post, anger is building  |  2nd post after trying to get money back from Agora  |  Exact copypasta to Agora SR  |  Another person fooled by the main poster  |  ""Confirmed Scam"" in Agora SR, after the OP has had enough people agree with him  Turns out that XanaxPharm was telling the truth the entire time, and that it was just one crazy idiotic customer (who I've now blocked and don't wish to hear from again), and fortunately he is a very respectable guy and we were able to make amends after the hatemail I had sent.  His ban was lifted soon after and there is no investigation and all feedback has been 5/5's so round of applause for vendors like this IMO."

If any of you are familiar with it, notice how particularly anyone running a website is no longer doing so?  I was an RC vendor for years before joining the...dark side.  Mostly on various forums, and then completely privately to a select clientele.  I was constantly downplayed for being paranoid.  Specifically for advising other vendors to treat every chemical as if it were Schedule I.    Some just put those labels because honestly the community sort of expects it now and will actually usually complain if it's absent.   Those people, I sympathize with.  The people who do this because they think it's a good idea and offering them any sort of protection rather than making themselves much more likely to end up in timeout, are what I like to call idiots.  And though it's sad that their careers are either cut short by them scamming, them being arrested, or simply freaking out and going dark, they pulled a early-Silkroad-promotion-level mistake repeatedly so all things considered...what else did they expect?  Now what's funny here is that the substance being described literally is a federally Schedule I substance.    They have to be fucking around.  The alternative is too...I can't even...

And somehow because a dishonest teenager who gave out 25i-nBOME powder to children, one of whom died, that honest and well-meaning businessman is now serving a 20 year prison sentence.  Just to clarify who went to prison, it was not anyone directly responsible, but the clean-cut ""intelligent"" gentleman trying to run a legal internet business and had no influence over the events that occurred nor knowledge that such a thing would ever take place with his responsible and adult clientele, of course.  After all, they said they had lab equipment and had ample supper so no need to eat random dangerous powder.  May be a bit before most of this sub's tenure but still.  It's obviously not just the stickers that did that (though his unique packaging at the time was a large factor), but the attitude that they encourage leads to shit like that.    Acting like you're running a boutique handmade soap site or something instead of ""legal"" drugs that could very well become the opposite overnight, turning you from an internet entrepreneur, above the board and keeping proper documents on all proceedings, into an unconvicted felon with his self-authored death warrant in the public domain, essentially.  All RC vendors are drug dealers.  Their general failure to realize this is harmful both to their personal safety and that of their customers, and contributes to their general idea rooted in coward-ness that they can operate in a haphazard way that would be unacceptable to any other dealer.    I remember one time, a certain clearnet RC site made me take a chemistry test and send them verified photos of what they deemed the ""proper material"" to handle the product.

The only somewhat justifiable instance I've seen it on a vendor's profile was for a medical cannabis vendor who is very specific about selling strains for a listed medical condition that strain benefits.

DarkNetMarkets,3dr41v,sapiophile,7,Sat Jul 18 23:29:49 2015 UTC,"Definitely use a live distro, and specifically Tails . It can take some time getting used to, but it is as secure as it gets and the site has nice documentation. It has everything you'll need, a bitcoin wallet, tor browser etc. Using a dedicated laptop is not needed at this case, but if you insist you can install the distro on the hard disk. However, I'd suggest you just use a small usb stick, since it's much more inconspicuous and easier to hide."
DarkNetMarkets,3dr41v,FAntagonist,2,Sat Jul 18 18:00:37 2015 UTC,The user can manage to break Tails' security if he doesn't heed to the few warnings on the website.  Also if you have an internal card reader consider booting from an SD card. It's even smaller and you get much more data rate per buck. Think SSD vs. HDD. From the numbers I just saw comparing equally priced 8GB USB sticks and SD cards you get a comparable speedup with the cards.
DarkNetMarkets,3dr41v,FAntagonist,2,Sat Jul 18 18:05:56 2015 UTC,"Yea, I agree with the sd card bit. For your first point, yes, of course nothing is anonymous if you are an idiot about it.

DarkNetMarkets,3dr41v,xanniez,0,Sat Jul 18 21:35:37 2015 UTC,"That wouldn't be a burner laptop, just a burner flash drive.

Also, there are some potential problems with using other peoples' hardware - hardware keyloggers are a thing, not to mention that in theory, the sky is practically the limit on how much monitoring could be done by untrusted hardware, from siphoning off GPG keys to anything else, although I wouldn't say that it's likely. That said, if an investigation did get far enough to identify a public computer as a very high-value target (read: not someone simply buying or even selling drugs on the DNMs), you'd best believe the hardware tricks might start coming out."

Also if someone would be kind enough to speculate the length of a prison sentance I would receive if le did a CD on an order like this.
DarkNetMarkets,3dr19i,fainting_g0at,2,Sat Jul 18 19:03:13 2015 UTC,"You'll be fine. This shit is ordered over the clearnet all the time with no effort given to stealth, for example your order may include a receipt saying that the substance is in fact GBL. One or two liters will likely not get you more than a love letter if anything. If I were you, I might be sketched out by the fact it's coming from China, but I don't know if packages from China are scrutinized more than those from Europe, which is where a great deal of GBL manufacturing plants are.  GBL is a legit product used in industry, it's an incredibly strong solvent. No, seriously, you need to be careful with this stuff. It should only be stored in HDPE containers, or glass, or ceramic. No plastics, no metals. They will be dissolved. Thankfully your insides won't be dissolved when you drink it. GBL is such a good solvent that it is absorbed and metabolized into GHB faster than GHB is absorbed into your blood stream.  Anyway, I reiterate that you have to be careful with this stuff. 500mL, 1L is a lot when each dose is typically below 2mL. You can easily fall into a cycle where you continually dose and redose throughout the day. I'm no doctor, but apart from wasting your life away I don't think it's that bad. It stimulates production of growth hormone and promotes deeper sleep, and is nearly impossible to overdose on when used by itself."
DarkNetMarkets,3dr19i,ETERNAL_GOLDEN_BRAID,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:54:08 2015 UTC,"Um, no.  It's a List 1 Controlled Chemical.  From the DOJ themselves  And no, they'll happily conduct a CD for a liter  Not nearly in the same realm as research chemicals in terms of legality. Unless you consider piperonal, safrole, pseudoephedrine, methylamine or fuck even ergotamine to be legal for other purposes.  Hell, acetic anhydride is used in heroin synthesis and is classified under List II... GBL isn't something one can import without consequence if customs peeks and finds it."
DarkNetMarkets,3dr19i,sstthrowawayyyy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:31:20 2015 UTC,"I never said it wasn't a controlled chemical. I wouldn't assume that GBL is a high-priority substance for US customs, mainly because of its obscurity. I'm probably being blind as to how things are done, but I don't think US customs takes the time to verify that every liquid entering the border is what it claims to be. Unless they are profiling a particular distributor who they're aware is importing a great deal into the US for personal consumption, probably fine. I don't have many specific facts to back this up, these are just my feels I've collected after reading about the topic.  If you're still reading, I have two interesting links to share: 1. The owner of a Polish company that sold cleaning products, and was especially popular for its GBL, was arrested a few years ago as soon as he landed in the US while taking a vacation. I think it's odd that the website (name is in the article) continues to operate and sell product given the attention it had from the US. So, you're right, it's for sure illegal. 2. PDF file This is a research paper. The gist is they tried to infer the structure of black market GBL distribution by watching new websites come online and similarities between existing ones, and they also analyzed Carbon-13 isotope levels (I think, excuse my lack of good chem. knowledge / inability to read it again right now) between product ordered from the various websites. The idea is different levels are characteristic of different manufacturing processes. Neat stuff."
DarkNetMarkets,3dr19i,ETERNAL_GOLDEN_BRAID,0,Sun Jul 19 09:01:12 2015 UTC,"Oh, for sure. I think the inherent risk is much higher when a lot of Chinese chemical manufacturers use a ""chemical company"" return address and a sketchy customs declaration too. And, to a lesser extent, when they don't use stealthy decoys. But the outside of the package I would say matters much more, as it is what's immediately visible.  As I understand it US Customs can open anything they please, without a warrant, unlike with domestic mail. And a liter or more of liquid seems... Too large and conspicuous. Definitely more so than a flat letter by comparison. So the risk is assuredly amplified with something like GBL.  Like you said, targeted profiling of shipments is probably the biggest method used to stop stuff at customs. When a vendor has packages seized it's usually more than one, because of that sole concept.   Appreciate you sending those links, I'll be sure to look through them; your second one seems particularly fascinating.  Given the risks involved if something were to happen and packages of GBL are discovered, to me it doesn't seem worth it to be honest. Even outside of plausible deniability if your house, computer, phone etc. are clean, it's still a hell of a time with legal process and lawyer fees.  At that point, and at this price (not to say this is not a good deal), one is maybe better off synthesizing their own GBL/GHB from GABA and sodium nitrite (Sandmeyer synthesis)  Although as a poster there has said there seems to be an impurity in the final result. But looking it over it seems to be a pretty novice-level workup, for one so inclined...   Absentminded of the additional legality concerns hehe, a braver soul than I might find it useful"

DarkNetMarkets,3dr19i,sstthrowawayyyy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:33:50 2015 UTC,"For anyone unfamiliar with GBL, it is some dangerous shit. It's an industrial-strength solvent. Never let it touch plastics or metals, only keep it in HDPE or glass or ceramic containers. Also, purchase a glass pipette accurate to 0.1mL. Your response to GHB is exponential, not linear, so while you might not feel anything after drinking 1.2mL, 1.8mL may knock you out for a while. As long as you avoid redosing, handle it carefully, and don't mix with other depressants, it's very safe and has few negative side effects."

I made contact with him and he said he would look for the tracking number but it's our own damn faults for FEing in the first place. NEVER FE, we fucked ourselves, and it's not like our 0/5 feedbacks are really gonna hurt his overall rating with over a thousand sales, prolly didn't even decline by a hundredth of a point of his numerator. But I say fuck it live and learn. Maybe it'll show maybe it won't, when he contacted me he didn't sound like he was blowing me off but again what scammer doesn't..."

The cinex nugs from GPJ were kinda airy too.  I generally take that as not being grown well.  I mean some buds are airier, but they should be pretty compact.  I generally stay away from the buds priced at 220 though, I'll spend for stuff listed at $250 which I know is good."

I will let this pic of his blackberry kush speak for itself 2- aside from SnG, at the moment I would recommend the mad dabber (who has been advertising here recently) or cultmadeline for a solid 250/oz (or close)  deal 3- I tried AdventureTime's $180 budget buds cinex and it's pretty darned great for the price; my sativa loving friends particularly enjoyed it, and one said he preferred it over skush"

As for the other person, I wouldnt say its really airy in the way crappy bud is, the flowers look like they form in tighter clusters you still kind of need a grinder to smoke it, it seems more like the airyness is in the genetics, but I have never grown cinex so I couldn't tell you for sure  AT, just told me his new strain will be Northern Skunk, im really looking forward to trying a more balanced hybrid from him.

DarkNetMarkets,3ds1kn,The_Ag0rist,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:33:03 2015 UTC,Ok I'm not sure how AG works but you tell me this can you make a FE listing and have it automatically FE when someone purchases it? Or is it like Nuke that you have to manually FE it? Because I've never seen the docs listings say that they're FE or Escrow in the description so I don't get what your saying by telling me that he changed all his listings to FE only?
DarkNetMarkets,3ds1kn,xanniez,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:21:08 2015 UTC,"His listings always had the little green thumb symbol for escrow, now they don't. But yes, you need to manually release funds even on an FE listing."
DarkNetMarkets,3ds1kn,xanniez,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:25:25 2015 UTC,Thank you. Then I doubt he's hacked. And on the smaller listings being 2100$usd well that must be a mistake he hasn't noticed. So what do we do? Obviously don't FE and if you guys feel that something is up just don't order until he comes back on and clears things up!

And to be honest you're the idiot who jumps to conclusions. give the guy a second to explain what's going on and we can tell instantly if he's been taken over by LE or not.. Jesus.

I would like it if there were more than 2 reliable bulk vendors. I never ordered from either of them because I'd prefer to order domestic, so I'm hoping DrX isn't compromised because DrXUSA was scheduled to open up tuesday (and by compromised nobody's even thinking LE, FastDonut just got hacked aka compromised) and I hope that Pharm2U will stay true to their word about enstating escrow, and that other reliable domestic bulk vendors with escrow will pop up."

Some pedo sites were compromised from IRL detective work and the site planted hostile scripts/flash on them or asked users to download sketchy software, or just duped people into given them personal info.   Servers are crazy vulnerable unless you know exactly what youre doing, but for users its really safe to use even a compro server as long as you keep scrips disabled and dont download any software off them.  btw tor is still safe even with the security slider on low, all it does it keep html5 videos, some images, and then finally certain fonts from showing, none of which pose a security risk."

How would you like if some older man touched you as a minor and posted clips of that across the Internet for older men to masterbate to? It's utterly disgusting and a gross violation of what we as a society should stand for.   There should be a limit on how far our privacy can go. I completely understand where the bureau came from on this one and I support their actions in taking down this ring. If anything, the people tried shouldn't be released on bond. They should be held in contempt until either convicted or proven innocent. These people are as bad as murderers - there are psychological effects on these children.

This is the argument that law enforcement is making: child pornography is hiding behind anonymous software and is becoming ever increasingly difficult to take down. They want the ability to track these users down and they're taking a broader approach - they want to be able to collect everything while they're at it. They're taking advantage of an uneducated Congress. Rarely you'll see a judge go and educate themselves about computers, the Internet, and Tor. Hell, half of them can't even sign into their e-mails without assistance. That's the flaw in our system, and that's the flaw that these three letter agencies are taking advantage of.   If we prioritize taking down things that we shouldn't stand for, it's a win-win for everyone. For starters, we have a safer community. Law enforcement would have no business crusading their war against anonymization at that point. Against what will they argue? There are black markets selling drugs? Point your fingers down South at Latin America and tell them to start there. There will never be a definitive answer on the boundaries here, simply because they do not exist.

Not many people cared enough to read deeper about them and truly understand what their purpose is. This is a reason they're still allowed to do what they do. In fact, they've created their own court system and say screw the traditional route. It's mind blowing how this is legal.  I was thinking about buying my own island one day and setting up taps just outside their own data centers and posting online what they're scooping up for shits and giggles.

The Foes Of Freedom keep saying there was actually a trade so they can use this as an argument for spying on everyone and against Bitcoin and other instruments of freedom.  Breaking up child pornography communities does hardly anything against children being abused because there are no producers to be separated from their customers. On the contrary the demonization necessary to lead another misguided war keeps those who see that they have a problem from coming out and seeking help.  It's the same mistake statists make when arguing for the ""war on drugs"" by saying that it protects children. I don't have to explain that taking the freedoms of everyone away to seemingly protect a subset of the population is neither helpful nor just. Like almost any government program it is having the opposite effect. Forcing people to keep behind closed curtains what they rightly see as ethical avoids anyone from being able to step in to avoid street dealers selling to kids. But hey, Ross Ulbricht ""damaged the fabric of society"" (or whatever that judge pulled out of her ass) by initiating a movement that achieves an inherent minimum age for drug purchasing. 10 year olds run around outside with cash in their pockets all the time but it takes a lot of neglicence on the parents' side to not notice the Tor browser, the coins or at least the packages and envelopes landing in their own home.

Child pornography is inhumane, disgusting and shouldn't be tolerated   This is debatable.  Dr. Milton Diamond from the University of Hawaii shows evidence that ""Legalizing child pornography is linked to lower rates of child sex abuse"".  Not tolerating/legalizing child pornography could mean you're supporting a policy that has demonstrated increased instances of child abuse.  Meanwhile, with today's mandatory reporting laws, and child porn possession being a strict liability law (you neither need intent nor knowledge of the crime happening), the system has developed in such a way that people are deterred from reporting potential child abuse because they're scared of being punished. If you report child porn, you instantly have the finger pointed at you because you're essentially admitting to committing a felony by looking at, and at least temporarily possessing, child porn.   How would you like if some older man touched you as a minor and posted clips of that across the Internet for older men to masterbate to?   If I were a homosexual, I may not have minded. There were plenty of older women in my life I wouldn't have minded if they touched me and recorded it.  There is a scary number of children being arrested for felony possession of child porn of themselves or their girlfriends/boyfriends. Children are irresponsible yes, but criminalizing this irresponsibility doesn't help or protect them. It ruins their lives even more.   These people are as bad as murderers   Your mind is deranged if you think possessing any digital file is as bad as murdering someone.  There is no scientific proof that the existence or exchange of digital files in any ways harms someone remotely. There is no voodoo mystical connection going on.   They should be held in contempt until either convicted or proven innocent.   May as well bring back witch trials and fascism while we're at it...   They are too young to consent or even know what is going on.    They're too young to consent to eating at McDonalds, playing contact sports, or joining a church congregation. This is what parents are for, to make decisions for their children. And I would say it's very debatable whether parents should be permitted to make sexual decisions for their children. I'm inclined to trust parental judgement over government judgement."
DarkNetMarkets,3dn7rx,OG_DANKO,4,Sat Jul 18 05:47:06 2015 UTC,Wait... are you comparing eating McDonald's to parents taking pictures of their children naked?
DarkNetMarkets,3dn7rx,chip_ninja,-1,Sat Jul 18 07:36:49 2015 UTC,"Yes. McDonalds is potentially malnutrition (see: childhood obesity rates) and nude photos potentially lead to psychological symptoms (see: childhood sexual abuse studies).  But my point wasn't even that McDonalds is bad, or it should be considered child abuse, but rather that children don't have the ability to consent to anything. So saying ""they can't even understand sex!"" is pointless since they equally can't understand the potential risks of contact sports, schooling, religion, etc. yet it's considered admirable parenting to sign up your children to play American football (which kills children every year) and to indoctrinate your children with psychologically scarring ""god fearing"" techniques (which often leads to sexual dysfunction that causes child sexual abuse in the first place)."

DarkNetMarkets,3dn7rx,AndThenHeSays4,3,Sat Jul 18 22:11:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with your general sentiment, but not your conclusion.  We're talking about people using encryption to share files of people (children) being exploited and abused.  Some of the people involved (as stated above) have even acknowledged that they have taken part in child abuse personally.  I don't think there's any justification for what they do, and hopefully these people get everything that's coming to them.  At the same time, this raises some serious issues.  The fact that the government is willing (and able) to start compromising systems at will to anonymize the hidden services and users says the system is broken and does not work for the original intentions.  Essentially this says if you say or do things the government doesn't like, they can and will take action.  Combined with their other efforts (downloading and analyzing all our traffic) this story is extremely troubling.  So yeah.  I can agree with you on part of it.  Those fuckers responsible should burn.  The unfortunate reality though is that any system which enables truly anonymous and secure communication will be the same sort of system that enables people like that to do it without getting caught.  The fact that DNMs and sites like this keep getting rolled up by LE should highlight that there are some serious issues that need to be addressed.  It's easy to say the solution is to keep the software up to date and such and such turned off.  The reality though is there will always be exploits and zero days... so there's no guarantees.  Staying on top of updating (etc) just means you're less likely to be hit (by old exploits), and gives you a false sense of security because you simply don't know (case and point researchers being told to sit on the information until after it was used).  The only thing this really did for me was reinforce the belief that whether through your own fault or the fault of others you should always expect your communications to be accessible by those you don't want to see them.  Personally I'd feel better if it were individuals taking these guys offline... but I suppose that's not really any better."

The whole point is to avoid the government finding users. Given that child pornographers are lower value and more common than political dissidents avoiding government persecution, perhaps we should think of them as useful and disposable test cases?

DarkNetMarkets,3dn7rx,Munchie_King,-5,Sun Jul 19 16:22:21 2015 UTC,"To me, it seems like the government should INCREASE money and resources to break encryption/security rather than seek an overall DECREASE in encryption/security.  In a general sense, it achieves the same goals, but it forces us to prioritize what gets an allocation of resources.  Pedophilia?  Certainly.  Drug purchases?  Not so much."

DarkNetMarkets,3dn7rx,Kazaa99,4,Fri Jul 17 22:53:18 2015 UTC,"It's a double edge sword. Many early philosophers have warned about an even balance between the government and its citizens; our nation was founded upon the principles that the constitution would be followed, and that's what separates us from other nations as well as from a tyranny. We have many basic rights that in recent years have been breached and we have willingly accepted these breaches, not even in a state of war. Keep in mind these are people that dedicated 60+ years to researching prior civilizations, and wrote a constitution based on what they knew. It was a way for society to operate.  With that being said, if the uneven balance were tipped in favor of the government having the upper hand on encryption, they'd thereby able to read all communications, which is something they should not have the authority to do. Whoever started this trend had political ambitions unbeknownst to the world; they were looking not to spy on the world, but world leaders. With recent technological innovations, they are now able to collect a lot more. The war on drugs isn't a war on encryption. It's a war about keeping society ""safe"" from what has been presumed to be a destructive force. However, with today's progressive movements, we are able to see that what we want to put in our body is our business. The Feds look at this as rebellion to what has been decades of their laws. Has ""research"" been falsified? In certain instances, yes. As laws were written by men, they surely can be unwritten.   Going onto the budget factor: the NSA alone is estimated to be shy of a billion dollar budget. A billion dollars. That is an insane amount for any agency, who has no disclosure, to have. If you're going to propose funding them further, I want to see what they're doing before I end up paying more out of my pocket. As I see it right now, I'm being paid to be spied on and having my reasonable privacy breached. The worst part is that they're relentless with the information - they'll pass it on for ""parallel reconstruction"", which you can see is set up from the start (i.e. The Silk Road case).  As for drug purchases, the belief is that it affects those around us. Meth addicts are bad. Heroin addicts are bad. They'll go to any length to get their product. This is why we have a war on drugs. However, since their funding is dependent on what they're able to seize, they'll pretty much snag any opportunity to ""bust"" anyone for a pay raise. This goes against the fundamental principles of why we have these agencies. Do I wish these practices were amended to take only the most dangerous substances off the street? Yes. However, in order to change something we have to step up and reach out to our policy makers. After all, we elect them to represent us. What they're doing in office is their own agenda; we have to stop that. Why allow them to make a lot of money while we don't get what we want?   As for resources being allocated to pedo's: my stance is clear on that. If there are pedo sites, the community should be one step ahead of law enforcement. Many times they don't go after them/can't because of technological barriers and jurisdiction matters. When they have a strong case, they'll pull it through their court system and make a huge deal about it - it makes like their war on encryption is for a good cause. It's a facade for further spying. The community has a lot of talented people; we can make a difference and take these sites down ourselves/uncloak the owners of these sites. We can bring them to justice without having to dish our tax money over something that could of been achieved weeks, maybe months ago. Many LE officials are people who couldn't land a corporate job and are in ""second"" place. Not meaning to degrade them, but they're not getting paid nearly enough, so they only look for big fish.   I probably went really off topic here lol."

DarkNetMarkets,3dn7rx,bunnydoctor,2,Fri Jul 17 22:06:46 2015 UTC,"Here we get a nice insight of a theory on how Law Enforcement could de-anonymize users of a tor service by using patterns of home ip's connecting to a TOR entry node and comparing them to connections at the exact same time to a site they have control over. With the terror package that came a while ago, all internet connections made by users are noted and saved in most countries by their ISP (data saved is IP of user, size of data package, timestamp and IP connected to - if I'm not much mistaken). Feds,CIA and NSA probably have easy access to this and know all the TOR ebtry servers, and then can draw a nice connection pattern which after a while would show an IP connecting to a TOR relay server and sending a data package, the same time a connection is made to their controlled website and receiving a data package - doing this enough times to single an IP address out.  It would work if there isn't thousands of users browsing the same page at the same time..  But yet annoyingly what most people would still get from reading this article and what they will tell everybody, is that if they just turn off javascript, everything will be juuust fine..."

MXM is an arylcyclohexylamine like MXE and ketamine, while MXP is a totally different kind of dissociative. 3-MeO-PCP has very similar binding affinities to MXE (Search ""binding affinities popular arylcyclohexylamines""), but being so much more potent by weight it needs to be dosed with a milligram scale if not volumetrically.

DarkNetMarkets,3dp06s,fun4dayz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:04:21 2015 UTC,"yeah, i try to save a few g's of every bag i get in a jar with a label, though this label actually came with the order - usually I have to make them myself (or rather, make my wife make them for me). It's nice to keep a few buds to reminisce with a few weeks/months later after it's been gone for a while - I understand some smokers don't have this type of patience or willpower. It helps that i don't smoke very much, or with other people very often.  I also throw a nug of every bag I get into a ""salad"" jar. It probably has about 20 different strains in it right now. No idea what i'll do with it."
DarkNetMarkets,3dp06s,fun4dayz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:19:18 2015 UTC,Well dam that's def different. Lol. U have very good self control obviously. Lol. I'm envious.

DarkNetMarkets,3dp06s,dnmthrowup420,2,Sat Jul 18 02:35:48 2015 UTC,I've ordered Critical Jack and White Rhino from him before and his bud is ALWAYS on point. Definitely a great vendor and I think his prices are great for the quality.
DarkNetMarkets,3dp06s,synikal12,2,Sat Jul 18 17:17:29 2015 UTC,Nice review. Critical jack is one of my all time favorites I may have to give this a try
DarkNetMarkets,3doil0,NavajoHills,9,Fri Jul 17 23:19:39 2015 UTC,Ordered off him once around the time people were complaining. I had no issues with what he sent me. I have reason to believe it was other vendors trying to ruin his name.
DarkNetMarkets,3doil0,Munchie_King,9,Fri Jul 17 23:24:40 2015 UTC,"On the same note, I ordered from PFM a few times over a year ago with little issue.  So who knows."

Nobody that knows what they're doing fucks with HF. The good reviews you see are from shills, people he sent free weed to, and ignorant kids.   I don't think HF is PFM or a scammer (yet). He's just a shitty vendor with subpar product at best. Once new users realize that there are much better vendors with amazing weed out there, they stop using HF."
DarkNetMarkets,3doil0,thisguyskillingme,5,Sat Jul 18 03:05:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with you in that he is very often new users first purchase. I think that is because the listing are front page on every market he is on.   I wouldn't say the product is bad, the two purchases I made were bud and crumble, both were decent/ pretty good for the price. There certainly are better vendors, in both quality and price, but he is not shitty imo."

DarkNetMarkets,3dpf6h,throwupandaway7345,3,Sat Jul 18 04:25:17 2015 UTC,"I miss the SR dope game so much.  Alongside SupremeSmoke, you had Subsrgood who had absolute fire and the only china white listing I've ever seen that wasn't fent. There was also DragonCove, Gotsitall, StringerBell/MarloStanfield, Supertrips, and then Deezletime for stamps. All of them shipped daily like clockwork, offered decent priced express which actually came next day... It was a dopehead's dream (minus the crazy prices)."
DarkNetMarkets,3dpf6h,lemonbreak,3,Sat Jul 18 04:31:28 2015 UTC,the only china white listing I've ever seen that wasn't fent   I'm not well versed with heroin but the thing that has always confused me is the China White.  I used to think it was just pure heroin from a region in Asia.  But then I've seen china white refer to fentanyl.  Why is this?  Is it a regional thing?  Or a false advertising that is so common now that fent is referred to as China White?
DarkNetMarkets,3dpf6h,Theeconomist1,5,Sat Jul 18 04:49:49 2015 UTC,"China White used to a pure form of heroin manufactured in the Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia).  In the 70s or 80s people started marketing a-methylfentanyl as china white due to it's appearance. At this point analogues weren't illegal, so it was either mixed with heroin to increase potency/quantity or sold with inactive cuts."
DarkNetMarkets,3dpf6h,lemonbreak,3,Sat Jul 18 05:09:20 2015 UTC,"So if you see a vendor selling China White, I guess you assume its actually fent and not the ""original"" China White?"
DarkNetMarkets,3dpf6h,Theeconomist1,3,Sat Jul 18 05:11:59 2015 UTC,"I believe every ""China White"" listing I've seen recently since SR1 advertises that it is in fact a fentanyl analogue. Some people are selling a-methylfentanyl, paraflourofentanyl (PFF is the reason the Federal Analogue Act exists), butyrfentanyl, paraflourobutyrfentanyl, or acetylfentanyl. Usually mixed with caffeine or mannitol.  Subsrgood (SR1) was the only person I've known to deliberately source powdered #4 from the Golden Triangle. Afghanistan probably does 85% of the worlds opium production and even still most of the dope in the US comes from Mexico and Colombia. It's not often we see dope from SE Asia, especially on the streets."
DarkNetMarkets,3dpf6h,lemonbreak,2,Sat Jul 18 05:17:20 2015 UTC,"He was great.   Also in the NE all of the dope is fire afghan powder, golden triangle buns for cheap.   Once you drop just a bit west tho it all turns to shit far. Fuck that shit."

Alot of dope is brown/beige/tan but that's due to impurities. Just like the dark colors in mdma. You see VL advertising china white"

DarkNetMarkets,3dpf6h,thesheddy,3,Sat Jul 18 23:08:17 2015 UTC,"Amen. There is NO consistency when it comes to dope vendors other than RSS. I ordered from him earlier this week and received it in less than 24 hours.  Trappeddownsouth (TDS) appeared to be legit about a month ago when he was new. Very friendly, answered all questions in a matter of hours -- not days, very fast shipping (offered express and would arrive in 24 hours) and dope is hella good for its price. He now is getting sketchy. I ordered 3grams last week, express, and did not receive until this past Wednesday. He never once, not once, answered any messages. I even tell them ""look, I know you all get busy and get behind, if you're behind on my order just tell instead of making me sweat it out and I'll be 100% cool about it."" Half the time he doesn't mark shipped until well after it's been shipped, so you can never rely on that. He'll just confirm it.  He's still offering escrow, so I went ahead and made a purchase not long ago, but did not FE this time. I wanna see if I'm wasting my time on another vendor that can't take the pressure of popularity and fast money.  His situation is almost exactly how SnS turned out to be. But believe it or not, he/she told me they're resending a pack to me with extras that was never received but will not be offering express or dealing with people who have negative feedback or very few buys in the future. Believe-it-or-not I think they're trying to get their shit straightened out.  It's my opinion they became overwhelmed with orders and popularity due to their good dope and getting so behind due to their popularity on agora regardless of what people were saying about SnS on Reddit. Up until a month ago, I never had one bad or sketchy transaction with them and I had dealt with them since BB. People like SnS and TDS need to get everything lined up and in order and prepared so they don't fall behind and play catch-up and become tempted in saying 'fuck it' by not going through with orders.  I don't care what people say on here about SnS, I truly think they're trying to straighten everything out and make things right. If not, why send me a message stating they'll be sending me a pack with extra? I've also read some of their recent feedback and people have gotten refunded or their original order.  Why not deal on the dnm where you can charge a premium price and skip all the bullshit when it comes to hustling on the streets? You know they're making good money. So I actually feel pretty good about them, and if they end up coming through like they said they would, then I'll do business with them.  I'm certainly doing business with RSS again. He's a businessman and knows how to handle his shit; plus his gear is fucking fire.  I'm just really disappointed with TDS because they seemed like good people. I was one of the first to buy from them and he even told me in a pm that he doesn't understand why vendors leave their customers hanging, and then here he is now doing the same shit. I really liked his gear, and like I said, for the price you can't beat it, but we'll see.  If worst comes to worst I'll stick with RSS and use a new vendor every now and then that's hungry for a couple buys and move on.  TL;DR RSS is by far the most consistent dope dealer on agora.Received my pack from him this past week in less than 24 SnS is trying to make things right, and regardless of the consensus of reddit, I personally don't think they were scamming, just got overwhelmed and couldn't take the heat. They're sending me a pack with extra that never came a month ago (their gear was prob my favorite). TDS is sketchy, thought he was legit (prices 10/10, quantity 15/10, speed 10/10, comms 10/10, gear 8/10) but has stopped communicating with customers and is consistently late getting orders out w/o any communication; however, still offers escrow and his packs are always fat. Escrowed recently with him instead of FE'ing one last time to see if he's gonna end up pulling out."

DarkNetMarkets,3dpf6h,thesheddy,2,Sat Jul 18 16:41:52 2015 UTC,"Real Supreme Smoke and Trappeddownsouth. RSS is probably the best dope vendor on agora -- you cannot go wrong with him.  I would recommend TDS, but like I said in my previous post, I don't know what's going on with him. His bags of gunpowder dope are fat as fuck, always overweight, and he was very friendly and would always answer questions. Now he ships out late and does not answer questions. I sent him a message about my last order yesterday asking if he could include something if he hadn't already shipped and he hasn't responded, and I doubt he will. He won't mark 'shipped' either, even if he has shipped. However, if he does come through, and ends up being legit, he could easily be one of the top dope vendors on agora.  TDS does offer escrow so if you wanna give him a try, you could always use escrow if he tries to pull something slick. I only escrowed once before with him and that was with my first order and after that I FE'd. I was buying at least a couple grams from him a week. I just put in another order but used escrow and bought priority instead of overnight since the past couple of times he shipped late. I was buying overnight from him and I would receive overnight. There just seems something up with him, but it could be that he's just overwhelmed with orders because he's gotten very popular.  If you want someone you can 100% count on, buy from RSS. I bought a gram of his best (expensive) and bought overnight shipping as well. I didn't have to communicate with him, and received in less than 24 hrs."
DarkNetMarkets,3dpf6h,Dr_Zhivago_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:35:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I don't see your point. So...RSS if I want a sure thing? But recommend TDS, why..? He over weights?

DarkNetMarkets,3dpf6h,thesheddy,2,Sun Jul 19 02:53:06 2015 UTC,"Yes RSS sure thing.   I was just stating how much I liked TDS for the many reasons I listed, but has been acting pretty shady lately."

They are slipping just like every other dope vendor who is not prepared for the flooding of orders that comes once they start to get that real good feedback."
DarkNetMarkets,3dpf6h,thesheddy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:00:15 2015 UTC,Speaking of SnS she contacted me earlier in the week and apologized about not shipping my pack out a few weeks ago and offered to reship with a little extra. Just received today. She's legit -- just got overwhelmed. She's gonna only offer a certain amount each week and when that gets bought up we'll have to wait until the next week so she doesn't get behind on orders.
DarkNetMarkets,3dpf6h,thesheddy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:39:20 2015 UTC,"That is what's up.  A lot of people hate on SnS but i had nothing but a good experience with him/her.   I know she doxxed some customer a while back and I know they used to cut their dope way too much for a while, but i had ordered after they fixed all that (like a 3-4 weeks before BB went down) and that dope they had then was so damn strong.  It had legs like a fucking ostrich too.  I stopped ordering because i was getting in way too deep and had developed a huge tolerance."
DarkNetMarkets,3dpf6h,iliveintor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:41:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I actually fully overdosed on that dope. It was fucking POTENT. I had to be really careful.   I think they're working all their kinks out, and will be good vendors."
DarkNetMarkets,3dpf6h,1ReviewReviewer1,2,Sun Jul 19 03:38:29 2015 UTC,Shit man i almost did the same thing.  I loaded up around a .2mg shot and it had me on the floor.  I definitely think that stuff is actually very dangerous to any novice users who have only ever had shitty dope.
DarkNetMarkets,3dpf6h,Dr_Zhivago_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:32:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this happened to me around April. Just started messing around on the dnm. Only had fucked with stepped on street-level shit in the past.  I bought one of their first potent bags on BB after they had been accused of cutting their dope. I loaded up way too much. I remember pushing and the next thing I remember is being in my family room with fire-rescue being there.  My fiancee said she heard some grunting-like breathing from the bathroom and found me on the floor blue in the face, foam coming from my mouth, and hardly breathing.  It was a huge wake-up call for me in regards to using dope. I'd much rather load up a weak shot the first time than load up something I can't handle. If I feel like I've loaded up too much, I'll push about half, slowly, wait to see how I feel, and go from there.  But since then, their gear has been very good. I like how they're only offering a certain amount each week, and when they sell out, you gotta wait until the next week so they don't get overwhelmed and behind. They're also not offering overnight shipping unless you buy at least 5grams.  They're one of the few where I'll only buy 0.5g at a time due the strength. I'm glad they're back and will continue to do business with them.  I think it says a lot that they're trying to contact all the people that didn't get their orders a month ago and are reshipping. If they truly were looking to scam they wouldn't have gone through the trouble of contacting me and others and resending out packs along with establishing new rules.  We need more reputable dope dealers on ag. I'm sure there are more that I should try. I try to stay away from that one person that makes a vendor out to look bad. Now if it's the majority I'll listen, but I never listened to the few that constantly bad-mouthed SnS. So far they've worked out for me and a lot of other people other than their slip-up last month because they were getting so popular and overwhelmed with orders; but they've made that right. In fact, I'm about to get right on their little present they sent me today. :)"
DarkNetMarkets,3dpf6h,1ReviewReviewer1,2,Sun Jul 19 08:03:48 2015 UTC,tls still has potent gear but it lacks the legs and itch i was looking for in my opinion
DarkNetMarkets,3dpf6h,1ReviewReviewer1,2,Sat Jul 18 06:54:14 2015 UTC,"Can't believe everyone considers CaliClaire a shit vendor all of a sudden, though personally that leaves more product for me to buy, so I can't complain! CaliClaire always is consistent on great dope at a good price. Granted this last batch wasn't superb as usual (even though I certainly didn't consider it garbage by any stretch, I can admit it wasn't up to par with the fantastic quality she usually has), but one 'not up to par' batch and she's automatically a shit vendor?   100% of the vendors on the DNM have had a shit batch at one time or another (yes, even RSS). So keeping that in mind, CaliClaire has had the least shit batches then any other dope vendor I've used. Every now and then all vendors get that shit batch, it happens. But when all is said and done, I still think CaliClaire is one of the best in the dope game. This new batch (since 7/15) she got is fucking fire. There's a reason she sells out daily, but if people want to disregard her because of 1 sub-par (but not fake garbage as some people claim) batch, all the better chances for me to grab a bag before she sells out!"

DarkNetMarkets,3dnj48,bitblender,19,Sun Jul 19 19:41:28 2015 UTC,"Such a waste of time and another chance to get scammed out of your BTC.  Buy BTC from LBC----> new wallet ----> Market. Or add a few new wallets in between if you're paranoid.   Plausible deniability, just bought and sold some bitcoin to make a quick $20 online. idk where they were sent.   And on top of that I have yet to see any LE case of ""follow the blockchain"". Plus when buying from LBC its already anonymous to begin with.  Unless you choose a service or seller that requires identification which most do not.  And no offense to Grams either, it's the best service for the Darknet ever created, and I use it quite frequently. Literally my homepage on tor. Just not the tumbler.   In conclusion, the blockchain is like the USPS mail, there are so so many transactions nobody is going to pick you out and follow you for no reason. Even if you get a CD and search warrant and sent to jail, chances are they still won't follow the blockchain. You have a better chance of getting a CD while taking a shit, and unable to wipe your ass, before you get followed on the blockchain. Just my 0.001BTC  If you do choose to use coinbase, or similar service that's connected to your IRL identity, I would certainly recommend a tumbler. Even though sending to a few different wallets with plausible deniability may work just as well. Anything connected to you is always worth the extra protection. You shouldn't be purchasing bitcoin intended for purchasing illegal drugs under your confirmed identity to begin with. LBC is anonymous as it is and is why I always advise using it."
DarkNetMarkets,3dnj48,PurpleBeamz,5,Fri Jul 17 18:43:40 2015 UTC,"If you check https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/LocalBitcoins.com you can see that there are many transactions from different Markets to LBC. LE can ask Localbitcoins to receive all information about the users of these addresses, of course you were always using Tor and only did anonymous cash purchases. But even then, LE is going to see who you traded bitcoins with and the messages you sent eachother on Localbitcoins to set up the meeting for cash trade, the location and time etc. This is still a lot of information and it would scare me. They might try and trick you into a cash/btc trade via Localbitcoins too.    Sending a bitcoin from purchase place to Wallet A to Wallet B and then to Market is just sending the coins in a straight line, even if its different wallets it easy to follow. If you use a mixer instead of Wallet B your original coins is going into the mixer and while at the same time you receive new coins to whatever destination wallet you wish. There is no link or taint between your new coins and your original coins.    Breaking the chain and receiving new coins without taint to the original coins is just the first step of mixing, to stop advanced blockchain analysis we are going to need some more techniques. First and most important is a randomized fee instead of a static fee, it prevents amount-based blockchain analysis. The second is a randomized delay on withdraw, it prevents time-based blockchain analysis. These features are the corner stones of good bitcoin mixing. If these techniques are used you can not even guess which transactions to follow, there is going to be thousands of transactions on the blockchain matching within the randomized fee range and the randomized time delay, this is not feasible. This mixing/tumbling/blending is providing much better anonymity and more than just plausible deniability than just sending coins between your own wallets and then sending it to a market.    We can not know what tools LE are working on, but it would not be hard to guess that it would have more advanced blockchain analysis methods than walletexplorer.com has right now and they are able to track Agora, Btcfog, Nucleus and so on right now. We know that all transactions are permanently stored on the blockchain forever. Once they have a tool as simple as walletexplorer.com it could check every transaction that have ever happened since the beginning of Bitcoin, they could check what wallets received coins from those easily tracked markets and follow the coins from there. Even if LE is not doing it now, its never too late for them to start if they decide to because the blockchain is there waiting.    //Bitblender"

DarkNetMarkets,3dnj48,bitblender,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:15:34 2015 UTC,What do you think of purchasing BTC from LBC -> purchasing LTC with BTC -> purchasing BTC with LTC again? Wouldn't that break the chain without running the risk of a tumbler being compromised by LE?
DarkNetMarkets,3dnj48,hog_master,2,Sat Jul 18 09:16:17 2015 UTC,"It would break the chain, but it also depends where you do your litecoin trades, if its a legit service on clearnet then they will give up your information if they have to. And litecoin is like bitcoin, its not anonymous so they could follow that to your purchase of BTC again. But if you purchase a anonymous coin instead of litecoin, i have heard Monero/Darkcoin is anonymous but im not sure how good it is as i have not looked it, doing a couple of transactions between your wallets (not between web service wallets, real wallets) with that and then send it to another trade service where you buy BTC again for your Monero, all over Tor of course, could work. That should not be possible to follow, if Monero/Darkcoin really has good anonymity. You need to make sure your wallets are running over Tor, preferably on Tails or a Isolating Tor Proxy like Whonix.    To prevent the compromised LE mixer i actually have a line about that on the front page on Blender, ""If you want to really make your trail as difficult to follow as possible, and there is another service you trust you could mix your coins several times."". I try to educate the users on how to mix as safe and anonymously as possible in the guide, then they can make a choice themselves. Using two mixers would probably be a bit expensive and im not compromised, so its no problems, but still, if someone feels its necessary then its up to them.    //Bitblender"

I agree with you overall, but this particular statement isn't necessarily a good point. It's not some random person we're concerned will track us down(at least not in my case) it's law enforcement. I think the Snowden leaks showed that the NSA's capabilities are beyond what most people imagined and starts to brush into dystopian science fiction at times, and I'd venture to bet that Snowden didn't have access the worst of it.   That said, even with billions upon billions of dollars worth of pattern detection algorithms and whatnot, I don't believe that the blockchain could be tracked with a high enough burden of proof for a courtroom or even to establish the beginning of a parallel investigation unless you do something monumentally stupid. If all your coins from darknet transactions were to dump into a single wallet that's been labeled as ""GARY SMITH OF SEATTLE'S DRUG MONEY"" on blockchain.info and you also list this wallet address on your personal home page and/or facebook account, then you are probably fucked. Beyond a stupid mistake like that, I can't think of many ways that a bitcoin address could be conclusively linked to your identity using the blockchain alone or even with access to site records."

DarkNetMarkets,3dnj48,J0NJ0NES,5,Fri Jul 17 19:31:02 2015 UTC,"Obviously im going to argue about why Bitcoin Blender should be on the Superlist.    Bitcoin transactions are not anonymous, its only pseudoanonymous and once one of your addresses is known to be yours its easy to make up your whole wallet and its transactions with a site like walletexplorer.com. An address can be known to be yours by not purchasing coins anonymously, making a purchase at a store, sending coins to a friend/family etc.    Taking walletexplorer.com as an example its very easy to use and can be used by anyone. If you send coins straight from your wallet to Agora, Nucleus or other wallets that are tracked on walletexplorer.com its going to show up when looking at your wallet there. We have seen posts on /r/bitcoin about accounts being closed by Coinbase because of transactions to sites that violates their policies, so they are obviously trying to track to what sites their users are sending coins to.

Markets are high priority targets for LE in probably every country in the world, they are going to try to go after the users in every possible way they can to scare everyone away like they are trying to do with bittorrent file sharing for example. Encouraging users to not care about their bitcoin anonymity when LE is looking at every possible way to stop this from continuing is not a good idea. So i think the Superlist should contain an updated list of good trustworthy bitcoin mixing services so those users that chose to mix have a safe source for the correct links and latest information from the community.    //Bitblender"
DarkNetMarkets,3dnj48,elliephantas,2,Fri Jul 17 23:13:40 2015 UTC,"To add to bitblenders arguments, its important if the /r/dnm staff want to list mixing services that they categorize them in such a way that users understand what they are doing.   Bitblender/btcfog's model of doing things is functionally how you break taint between addresses, you must randomize the fee to complicate following amounts (or standardize the amount into whole numbers ala darkcoin), you must add necessary user specific delays, you must do the mixing off-chain, and you must enable this all so that it does not send change back to the originating wallet (ala webwallets, or in the case of darkcoin chopping off the change on small amounts and giving it to the miners, problem still unsolved for larger amounts).   Services like coinshuffle, joinmarket,  shapeshift, coinjoin, altcoin exchanges, and gambling sites are not safe to use and can be deanonymized in any number of ways. This doesnt preclude the service being a honeypot which can deanonymize any centralized service.   The only truly ""safe"" option is either darkcoin or monero, otherwise you must trust mixers, or get psuedoanonymity by using one of the aforementioned services."

I gurantee that would put a huge hitch in a competitor trying to do that, and would be hard to photoshop since all bit addresses can be researched on blockchain.  Now I know a lot of throwaway accounts never provide proof but is my belief that most people who get scammed by bitcion fog are people that put a lot of money on that site (I got scammed 1000 dollars) and I feel like people that do that are dealers not computer guys. So my theory is that most people who get scammed like this do not care about making a account until they get scammed, and they only make the account as temporary relief or just assurance on what happened and once that's over they stop using the account forever, hence making it a throwaway account."

Because there are many people who are convinced that tumbling is necessary, however, it is imperative that legitimate links to safe and reputable tumblers be kept on the superlist. That way those who are new to DNMs and paranoid about safety have the link to a tumbler that is legitimate, as opposed to a scam they may find on the Hidden Wiki."
DarkNetMarkets,3dnj48,rogueXleader,3,Fri Jul 17 20:31:24 2015 UTC,"This should be a vendor discussion. Money-laundering tools are for legitemizing illegally-earned funds, ie every penny I earn.  Are they needed to launder one legally-purchased bitcoin, which is destined for a drug purchase?  Of course not.  Some of us are failing to understand the definition of money laundering, and why vendors might choose to protect the origin of their bitcoin from discovery using taint analysis.  Vendors Re the only dnm users with reason to use bitcoinfog. Some have been using it for years to launder huge amounts.  Not one of them has ever come on here after being ""selected"" for a scam.  Its always some chump with a throwaway on a Friday, who is sending to  marketplace deposit address crom a web wallet.  You have to use real wallets that YOU have the keys to. Not coinbase to alphabay, blaming bitcoinfog instead of the scumballs its trying to hide from each other."
DarkNetMarkets,3dnj48,gramsadmin,4,Sat Jul 18 00:28:04 2015 UTC,"I've mentioned removing them several times for two primary reasons.   First, they're just something else we have to pay serious constant attention to the way we do markets and investigate and decide if the accusations of legitimacy are true and we don't do the same on any official level to any other tangential Dnm service like blockchain wallet programs or exchanges   Plus, historically they turn scam incredibly spontaneously, as in three minutes ago it was working and now ir has my 87 Btc. They get a lot of false accusations that people believe and just as many real ones ignored  from all the Crying Wolf. It's nearly impossible to tell beforehand if they're about to turn scam and about impossible to differentiate selective scamming from phishing, technical issues, or slow customer service. Which a  brings me to my second point.   Users of this subreddit we expect to be sophisticated enough in the use of DNMS that the decision to use tumblers/which one to use - are things that one should know before being fully ready and using markets properly, which is the desired audience of this sub. There is a wholly underutilized subreddit to learn all anout rumbling as well as learning how to research any market, service, or vendor before choosing who or what to use. Using DNMs require a lot of homework.  When someone asks a remedial question such as ""how do I buy bitcoins"" we send them to the noob sub. We don't write lists of exchanges, storage wallets and so on. I see tumblers as a tangental service and although there's no reason to ban discussion of them, butive always felt that listing just a few of many, many of them, ir could certainly be perceived as favoritism. I would like to keep them *off the sidebar."

Coinebase and other bitcoins markets are banning more and more accounts because they are sending to the darknet markets. You might say just to use an intermediate wallet. but ti si pretty simple to see where bitcoins go even 3, 4 hops down.  If anything I think the up tick in banned account from coinbase proves they are watching the blockchain more and more. You never know in the future if they will come out with better software that can track past transaction. Just because they aren't doing it now doesn't mean they wont use it in your court case 3 years from now. It is just another way top be safe and protect yourself.

Tell me, if i have 4.2131412 bitcoins and send them to 100 addresses whose final desination still adds up to 4.2131412 and just so happens to move into a darkmarket that it cant be deduced that maybe it was some limpwristed attempt at laundering?

You're right though, the easiest way to verify this would be to contact support ourselves. Honestly, that's not something I want to make a habit of doing, and it's not something which should be expected of us.  There's also the question of what if they do respond to us, but not the people who were apparently scammed? Then we may be inundated with requests from people who were apparently scammed by them, to act as a messenger for their cause. It's going down a road I would prefer never to travel.   I would prefer to leave everything as is. I thought the warning in the superlist about multiple reports of selective scamming was enough. But people are continuing to bitch, as well as accuse us of only keeping them there as if we are somehow profiting off that deicison, and those accusations also get tiresome - which led to the inspiration for this thread.

How about instead of that text warning added to a sub-set of services on the Super List, there be a tally of metrics scraped from the subreddit.  As an example, the total number of complaints.  Maybe even broken down by throwaways vs everyone else.  It may be automated based on some algorithm to determine the metrics in question.  This is doable, and isn't rocket science.  Under such a system, there would no reason to complain to or about the mods.  The metrics on the Super List would be just a reflection of the community.  It would be a summary of what a user would come to understand if they were to exhaustively research each service themselves by reading all the posts and comments contained in this subreddit.

But unfortunately some in the community do view it as an endorsement of the service and thus, there are some who then think that the mods are somehow paid off to keep these services in the list.  It seems there must be a compromise where the list could be there for reference and be understood that none of the mods endorse any of the tumblers and might not even endorse tumbling at all.    I guess teh way I view it is without the links, would that increase the number of people who fall victim to getting phished and thus hurt the community?  ON the other hand, we don't endorse them and don't want to give that impression.  I guess I'd hope people would do their research and make the decision on what services to use based on research and vetting and not just go off links they find.    I lean towards including the links in some fashion b/c I feel it protects the community better than otherwise.  I don't want to see people get phished.

Especially if used to discredit a commercial service through weight of numbers   NO SHILLING? Are you sure its not completely tolerated? Stand by your words by using your main account if its important. Throwaways are cowardly and snide. They have a zero or negative weighting.

DarkNetMarkets,3dnj48,SergeFT,2,Sat Jul 18 00:48:20 2015 UTC,I kinda felt like tumbling services were just a thrown together idea and shilled up our asses on Reddit and the forums to make the owners money. It's safer and cheaper to just switch hands the right ways manually. -This is all speculation by a schizophrenic conspiracy theorist btw
DarkNetMarkets,3dnj48,LoudRooster,2,Sat Jul 18 01:48:30 2015 UTC,"Cats who think tumbling is really totally unnecessary should probably take a look at this: http://blog.cryptocrumb.com/2015/03/prosecution-futures-blockchain-evidence.html - it's pretty sobering and eye-opening. The feds are catching on, and they're using some pretty advanced blockchain-analysis stuff that's only going to get better, and they're actually using it to prosecute people. Jus' sayin'.  Aside from that, though, I really think that JoinMarket is gonna be the future on this front. Check out /r/JoinMarket. There's also a script that just got released to run JoinMarket on Tails...  It's way cheaper, totally trustless (that's HUGE for a tumbler, solves basically the #1 problem with them), and pretty airtight security, but of course volume/liquidity matters. So folks should totally try it out, and maybe even start using it regularly.  The transactions generally don't mix quite as many inputs and outputs as a ""traditional"" tumbler, so for maximum security, you might want to run it through a couple of times, but really, it's so much cheaper that there's no reason not to.  Seriously, check this shit out, it's a cool idea."

Yes, you can achieve the same end result without using tumblers but not everyone knows how to.  If you remove the tumblers you should link to a few good guides explaining how to stay anonymous if you're buying from coinbase or circle, for example."
DarkNetMarkets,3dnj48,Jay-__,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:06:53 2015 UTC,"Am I wrong?   Respectfully, yes.  Tumblers are not designed to give you plausible deniability.  They are designed to give you anonymity.  Used properly , a tumbler is the only way I know of to break the statistical link between bitcoin transactions.  You may not value anonymity, but there are others (vendors) who need it.  There is also a case to be made for using tumblers even if you don't have a desire for anonymity, but to help provide anonymity for those who do (vendors).  The tumblers do have their place, and should stay on the Super List.  Specifically on Bitcoin Fog, what's wrong with trying to reach out to the service to try to get a clue as to what's happening?  I think it's reasonable to try to get an official response from a service that's being accused of wrong doing.  Both sides of the story, know what I mean?  But to me, the accusation of 'selective scamming' is tantamount to 'she's a witch'.  Based not in fact, but fear, ignorance and delusion.  They might be on vacation, arrested, have a bug in their code, or there might just be a whole lot of shills trying to shift tumbler market share in their direction.  If you're not willing to reach out to the service, that's your prerogative, but it would be irresponsible IMO to be influenced by a lot of talking along with zero evidence.  This is the reason the wiki was reworked.  I urge the mods to please stick to their commitment to provide transparent evidence before nuking a service (which is what effectively will happen if a service is taken off of the list).  If you don't, you're simply opening yourselves up to be manipulated by whomever.  The evidence requirement is what makes you specifically not shills.  And if you think there's pressure on you now for not removing a service from the Super List, wait until you remove one and have nothing in the way of evidence other than a bunch of accusations.  Ask for evidence, and if none is forthcoming and the issue is significant to the community, go and seek it out.  That's just the way I would do it.  Minimizes the chance of mistakes, and to a great degree covers my ass."

If it looks like a tax rate it probably is a tax! Tumblers charge me for mixing my clean coins. wtf? why would i need to do this? i've been taking cash out of a cash point for years and giving it to a dealer. It's a problem for them if they want to bank it... not for me when buying. I believe tumblers should be practically free for small amounts (i.e. buyers) since there's no real incentive to use them. I have considered the current tumbler model to be 'double dipping' on the cash they move.   I tumbled just one time and thought it was a waste of money. This is maybe considered annecdotal - but the one time i did tumble it was with bitcoin fog.

This is something none of the guides helped me with getting into this whole realm.   I can agree that we're all adults here and should be able to make our own decisions(I don't care what's on that list. I'm still going to do my own research and if something sounds fishy, like the current BTC Fog situation, I'll avoid it like the plague. The list has never swayed me to use a questionable service. Perhaps a happy middle ground would be allowing them to stay on the list, but flagged as potentially selectively scamming. Put all the information out there, and let the masses decide.

It's  honestly rare to find doses any higher then one hundred, often time the reason is two fold: they can sell more, and it's easier to dose sheets on values of ~50 or ~100 then it is to do an arbitrary number like 130.   Edit - spelling ⁿ stuff"
DarkNetMarkets,3dpeqg,HonkySpaceship,2,Sat Jul 18 05:04:54 2015 UTC,"I base my opinion on my experience in taking countless 100 mic and 180 mic tabs in my many years of dosing. You are correct that it could be very well 130 mics, but I will stick to my opinion on it being a good bit higher. Just my opinion and nothing else.  You are very right about vendors advertising falsely, but I feel this guy is not here to bullshit anyone around on dosage."

I figure someone that had time with the original L avengers might remember this, or know how to use the search bar."
DarkNetMarkets,3dpeqg,SIDKITTEH,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:06:17 2015 UTC,That HoS story literally came from one guy on TMG simply claiming to have had a test done. IIRC someone did do an energy control test on house tabs and they came back weaker then the advertised dose. Not by much but definitely not over.
DarkNetMarkets,3dpeqg,HonkySpaceship,0,Sat Jul 18 12:36:29 2015 UTC,"~50 or ~100 then it is to do..  came back weaker then the advertised...   You both seem to have issues with 'then' and 'than' so let me break it down for you.  I'd rather fuck your mother than your grandmother. This example shows you the word, 'than,' is used when comparing things.  I'd rather fuck your mother, then your grandmother. In this example, granny is getting fucked as well but she will get fucked after your mother is fucked.  If you practice decent grammar, you can keep your granny from getting fucked.  Now onto the post, our boi hog_master sad he/she never 'saw' a dose higher than the advertised one in his/her personal experience or time with the original avengers. Not that he never saw a test that proved it.   I mentioned the tabs SUPPOSEDLY being tested higher than advertised and referenced the post that was submitted around the time of the original avengers, a post he/she definitely should have seen.  Anyway, I apologize for my pedantry, but if we all choose our words correctly and carefully THEN we won't have issues with pedantic assholes like myself confusing what was said with what was meant."

DarkNetMarkets,3dpeqg,HonkySpaceship,2,Sat Jul 18 16:36:32 2015 UTC,"You must have ALOT of friends.   I can't quantify how many friends you think I have because ""alot"" is not a homophone you could confuse for another word like you did with the rest of the capitalized, incorrect words.  I can see why you would think it might have worked, 'allot' being a real word and 'a lot' being a common phrase, but it does not coincide with the whole, I'm going to purposely use the wrong homophone so this guy thinks I know what I'm talking about, deal. That is because homophones are words that sound alike but mean different things, not words and phrases.  I can break it down further so you can have the real effect properly affect you.  I have allotted the opportunity for many pedantic friends to join my inner circle and it has resulted in my friend group having a lot of friends.  :)"

DarkNetMarkets,3dp6ms,iliveintor,2,Sat Jul 18 07:00:31 2015 UTC,"I had hash with opium in, and loved it. Then I vaped opium with an old dude with an impressive collection. That was the hook. Then I flirted with pills, but too pricey.   I remember the first stamp I sniffed, fell back on my bed, and just overwhelmed with warmth listening to Miles Davis. I banged here and there, but was always alone doing it so I got pretty freaked out when I missed one time. I only miss the first time.    I've been off suboxone for about 10 days, and clean off h for roughly 3 months. Caliclaire, tls, dopeman, eastcoastpowder, and others I forget were my favorite dnm connects.   I just have 2 rules for myself now: No coke, and No dope. I wasn't dependent on coke, but would binge hard.   So I just puff the herb, and an occasional lsd trip when I've got a few days. I was able to maintain my job, but almost screwed up my last semester of college. Also, was disowned by half of my family, but literally found a home within my group of friends, who nearly all stepped up to support me, and just made sure I wasn't slipping. They were so understanding, and started inviting me to shit again with no judgement.   My motivation comes from losing so much, and being damn grateful for what I was able to salvage. I know I would lose at least half or more if I relapsed. My health deteriorated during that year long binge. So it's motivating to get back into working out, and seeing my body change, which gives me confidence.  Dope sick convinces me to not even flirt with the idea, although I think I had a spiritual moment when I was in full withdrawal. The way your brain during w/d just takes your life and makes it feel like the bleakest pathetic excuse for a human being. That was spiritual for me. It was like I was puking/shitting all the evil crap out. I didn't do NA or 12 steps just a cool therapist that didn't test me.    I'm interested in your ibogaine treatments? I seriously considered it, cus suboxone wasn't smooth on my body, and getting down to those few last mg's was tough on me. Although, it's kind of too late, but I'd still like to hear more.   I still check the reviews, and I'm happy that I got out when I did. The dope game around here sucks!"

I'm currently in a very similar situation and have tapered down to between .125mg and .25mg a day and want to be done with this shit. Started using dope when SR was around and got ""clean"" almost two years ago now after being prescribed a dose of Suboxone that was way higher than I had actually needed. Realized this about halfway through and have slowly tapered to where I'm at now with the help of some occasion benzos and daily dabbing (thank fuck for west coast wholesale prices on the markets). I've wanted to get off since the beginning of summer, but whenever I hit that 12-16 hour mark, the cold chills, watery eyes, and yawning sets in and just gets worse from there. At 1/8mg.... Fucking ridiculous."

I actually have to see him later today for the first time in 3 months to get my stuff back. Hopefully, no one leaves with a black eye.   My doctor initially gave me a higher dose too, but I just adjusted it on my own, so I've got quite a few extras laying around. I honestly don't think I could've quit without cannabis.   My body handled it pretty well I guess. I went from .25 to 0. I believe it took me two trys to go from .25-0. I think it was harder going from 8mg-4mg-2mg. The worst physical symptom was the pain in my shins and knees. A hot bath helped with this.

Congrats on 10 days off suboxone! I know you can do it man! Please pm me if you want to talk more about it, I'd be more then happy to and we could probably do some good for one another.   Very interesting point you made about having a spiritual experience while being sick. I can relate to a degree, being so sick, so tired, so hopeless that you basically are wishing you were dead. And time crawlssss. That is one of the reasons right there that I don't want to touch heroin again, and it is important to remember that.   I too am also working out - and while I'm not fat, just the opposite, it is great to see muscle build and my chest fill out. Keeps me motivated! And I'm feeling better then ever!  I did do a 1mg of sub today though. Damn, with no till you at all, I'm nodding out in a different way from it. Just hope I won't have to pay with being sick, but I think I'll be alright. Someone here and on another thread recommended kratom to help cravings, I think I'm going to try it.   I can't get back into it and lose anymore. Uni, family, nearly everything I've owned. Disgusting in hindsight. But also made me the caring u materialistic person I am today!  Likewise on the AA/na point. To those it helps I'm glad. But I think it's silly to call yourself powerless, an addict forever, and that it's the only way.   About the Iboga - it was a clinic is SA - and while it did work (I was under dosed I think) in regard to making one not sick, it didn't do anything for me about the headspace - waking up the next day not sick, but instantly hit with a bunch of paws symptoms - back pain, anxiety, all that. One day you were euphoric and warm, the next day back to reality. No transition. No walking through the valley of death to feel the ray of sunshine. I do know people it has worked great for - but their habits were minimal (codeine and trams) and they never shot.   Long live people like east coast p, and subs. I tried d only a few times from sr, I had other things I wanted to pursue more and living in the ne I could cop golden triangle quality buns for dirt cheap. But I just wanted to know the quality, and it was on point or just a little worse then the stamps.   If you want to know more please pm me, I'd be glad to chat!  Proud of you!"
DarkNetMarkets,3dp6ms,Reura,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:32:28 2015 UTC,"I've always wondered about the Ibogaine threapy Id love to hear more. My ex did the rapid detox in Miami, when it first hit it's big wave. What a crock of bullshit that was for 25K. Same complaint that you had about Ibogaine, the waking up in a different headspace and no transitional period.  Granted the transitional period is hell, but it makes you appreciate when you start to see the light at the end of the tunnel, you feel like you earned something. Waking up and being hit with the insomnia, sweats, anxiety etc makes you feel crazy. At least it did my ex. Obviously he relapsed and it's been a rollercoaster since. I do have a friend, the same one who experiments with Kratom - that has access to ibogaine. She has started sort of her own ""therapy"" locally with those that come to her in a last ditched effort to come off of dope or methadone / subs. I've seen ibogaine induction and the trip itself, but I never came over to her home to see the patient after they've woken up. She doesn't share much info, unless you're a patient or someone wanting to do it - because of obvious reasons. All that she's shared with me is that it only works if you're already committed to being clean, you have a support system lined up with meetings and you are going home to either a sober coach or a sober living facility."
DarkNetMarkets,3dp6ms,Miscontinued,2,Sat Jul 18 18:24:28 2015 UTC,Look into Kratom. It's a legal drug you can order online for cheap. It has helped others who were on heroin and other opiates. It binds to the opiate receptors so you get that kind of mellow high from just a little bit.

That is a huge milestone and true test to your self control, I hope you stick with it!  I wish I could say the same for myself, but unfortunately I'm still using. I won't go way in depth with this post, but to answer your OP question, it's pretty hard to maintain my self control as long as the DNM exists. With a normal street dealer or personal connection, you can easily delete your dealers number/cut all contact with them to a point where you physically cannot get high because you deleted your dealers number. However with the DNM, getting my next fix is just a website away. I can't delete/remove that contact as I know it always exists and is out there ready to go when I am. I could only wish I was strong enough not to browse the dope listings.   There were points I was clean for a few weeks/months at a time, yet even being clean I would still check out my favorite vendors profile page just to see what was going on with them. Beyond stupid of me to subject myself to that, I mean why the hell should I care what deals/quality of product my go-to vendor has when I'm trying not to use, but that's addiction I guess.   I do think there is hope for me sooner then later though, as I find myself recently using just to keep the sickness at bay. I haven't used with the intention to get a hard nod or anything in a few months, just the bare minimum to get by. That being said, I hear some alternative's being mentioned here (ibogaine and kratom I believe?) that I really am interested in trying. With my recent usage goal not being to get that hard nod in, I think I really could benefit well from some of these other alternatives, and once I get over the physical W/D hump I can start getting very slight motivation to live my life again without the need of opiates. If anybody here has the time to reply and school me on some knowledge on some info about some of these alternatives, I would greatly greatly appreciate it! Once informed on what I'm getting into with these, I really think it's something I'd pursue ASAP and hopefully try and make some progress towards a cleaner lifestyle!

Withdraws are shitty, but they are part of the game. I never order more than a few days worth, and always plan out my stash so I taper down a bit before comming off. The first few days sober aren't fun but to me that's part of the deal. These drugs allow me to borrow happiness from the future, and as long as I don't borrow too much and pay it back each time, I've been fine.   Good luck to everyone out there who has a problem."

I'd say it took a good 3-4 years to become a daily user. I've been through withdrawals every stage of my usage just about. I'd say the first 5 or so years, I'd describe withdrawals just like what you are saying. Sucky but manageable. Withdrawals now are awful. They get progressively worse I'd say. Anyway point being this shit can crawl up on you. Even once I became a daily user the w/d weren't awful. Now they are. Anyway not everyone falls into dependency. It takes constant respect for the substance bc it can hit you years later."

I stopped using it after having BTC disappear from my account back when they were selective scamming.   I was told that I had used a phishing site, but that's not the case since I used the link on the Markets Superlist. I know this because I always verify the URL before depositing Bitcoin. Nucleus tried to cover the loss by laying blame on something that to me was provably false, and that was enough to convince me that Nucleus is a disjointed operation run by very shady opportunists.  So a hack or scam are not all that surprising."

Ive used them before, annoyed by their server uptime. But I guess thats the cost of being secure.   Nucleus was proud on the 15 with their first update in 4 months but it seems that lax attitude to security has allowed a root access to their shit to be activated. Im guessing. I have consulted on security issues but not on front end darknet."

Don't go ordering to that address for many months if at all ever again.  A vendor's reputation isn't going to get ruined over 1 love letter unless it's a super small newer vendor or something so it's probably good for the community if you can share who the vendor was.  I know if I was looking to order something I certainly wouldn't place an order with a vendor who just got someone else a love letter just a few days ago.

DarkNetMarkets,3dneab,pt_LeslieDancer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:03:01 2015 UTC,"Why would I be sent two letters? One non-signature conformation and one requiring it.    Like others have said, they tend to send duplicates.  They want to make double sure you get the letter AND have proof you got it.     Should I go sign for the letter indicated on the pink slip?   Yeah, it won't a make a difference either way.  You might as well sign for it and get it.  By sending a LL, they basically are saying they aren't interested in busting you and giving you a warning.  Its safe to sign for it.   Any other tips for best course of action here are welcome. What level of heat am I under here?   Not much, they are slapping your hands with a ruler.  They aren't interested in pursuing criminal action against you, otherwise they probably wouldn't have given you the heads up.  There is debate on whether a LL burns an address - I would play it safe and burn the address.  Why risk it?  I assume you had personal amounts.  This is probably why you are getting a LL instead of a boot in your neck.  Best course of action is to burn your address, maybe consider laying low for a bit, and trying to figure out how they found the pack.  Let the vendor know their pack was seized - ask if this has been a problem for any of their customers - although many vendors won't be upfront with you I suppose.  Many long time users have reported getting one, if not more, LL over the years and they continued ordering just fine.  More than likely its fine, but I'd find another drop, if it were me and my safety.  Good luck, you should be fine though.  Sucks it happened."

DarkNetMarkets,3doi21,onekraqt,4,Fri Jul 17 23:35:08 2015 UTC,You are wrong. I have also waited over 3-4 weeks extra for a german order. Even though i live next door to germany.. the postal strike was effecting the whole world. Atleast our little drug world.
DarkNetMarkets,3doi21,LittleSk1pper,2,Sat Jul 18 00:50:08 2015 UTC,"I began to think the same thing, but I ordered the day after (?) the strike hit, it may have ended up in a region that was having worse delays (I can't remember when and where, but a while ago I posted some quotes from an article thay said some regions experienced worse delays than others), and I feel the system was just really inconsistent.  I'll mark the shipping category down with either a question mark or a 10/10 with an asterisk, since I have no way of telling whether it was the vendor's fault or not."
DarkNetMarkets,3doi21,CocaineNose,3,Fri Jul 17 23:50:08 2015 UTC,I can assure u it was not the vendors fault. I ordered from clearnet and darknet in germany. Two different vendors. Both took almost a month. I live next door to germany.
DarkNetMarkets,3doi21,flexxonem,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:53:22 2015 UTC,"I had a hunch, I guess I'll just stick to the 10/10 :)"
DarkNetMarkets,3doh30,gravymobber,3,Fri Jul 17 23:06:25 2015 UTC,"Many vendors won't bother with shipping questions until its been X days - some vendors will say 10 days, some 5, check the vendor profile to see what they say.  It happens.  Priority has taken has quick as 2 days and as long as 14 days for me.  Fucking sucks.  Also, some vendors will mark shipped before its actually dropped.  I try to only work with vendors who are honest about the marking of shipped.    Hang in there, give it a bit more time."
DarkNetMarkets,3doh30,Theeconomist1,3,Fri Jul 17 23:29:02 2015 UTC,"The usps have only taken more than 4 days for priority for me one time, and it was 6 days. Vendor was able to confirm that he noticed his packs landing later than average. This type of shipping communication does a lot of comfort for a tinfoil user like myself."
DarkNetMarkets,3doh30,TheDankJournal,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:24:09 2015 UTC,Totally agree. It's comforting to know that things are going through. I wish more vendors would be like that.

DarkNetMarkets,3doh30,saudimise_the_saudis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:10:46 2015 UTC,Do you guys also notice that some vendors will ship it out but not mark it as shipped until a day or two after?
DarkNetMarkets,3doh30,hog_master,3,Sat Jul 18 01:51:23 2015 UTC,"Im ashamed to admit that Im guilty of that.  When I accept an order I always write a message saying ""it will ne posted today and arrive tomorrow (saturday) no later than 1pm.  Same day shipping often goes down to the line. Its better to just get it posted if you can even if the customer missed my official cutoff time, then worry about the computer stuff after the post offoce is shut.  Only, sometimes I fall asleep on the sofa during ""the Simpsons"", or the site is down, or I see a hot air balloon and get overexcited. Or I dont like the look of that pizza van parked across the road.  Most of my customers know it will arrive tomorrow lunchtime. ""shipped"" is just a way to avoid writing to them."

I'd rather have the opposite happen - Vendor accepted, messaged and said they'd ship it today, not marked as or anything, but in escrow so no worries on my end.  That's why I really like tracking - solves bot the issues at hand."
DarkNetMarkets,3doh30,hog_master,2,Sat Jul 18 02:28:44 2015 UTC,I feel like tracking is given primarily with international orders? That's the only time I've ever gotten one.

DarkNetMarkets,3doh30,hog_master,2,Sat Jul 18 04:45:27 2015 UTC,I dont give the customer the tracking number until 2 hours after it should have arrived.  Any man-in-the-middle could intercept drugs in transit if they could eavesdrop the tracking numberduring that 20 hours ot takes to be delivered.

DarkNetMarkets,3doh30,weedisbad,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:07:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah some vendors do this. On agora at least, I think it's bc agora wipes orders after confirming so some vendors won't confirm and will mark shipped after its dropped. I'm fine with that. Id rather a late marked shipped than an early one. Lol."
DarkNetMarkets,3doh30,Theeconomist1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:07:32 2015 UTC,"Yes yes yes. Me too!   On Nuc, I like that is has the 3 day period to be marked as shipped, but I don't think it necessarily means that the vendor is going to mark it when they ship it, and it seems that way from reports on this thread.   And I'm fine with that! As long as it stays escrow, and the vendor messaged me about it acknowledging my order and telling me it will be sent the next day; that's all I need to know!"
DarkNetMarkets,3doh30,hog_master,2,Sat Jul 18 04:49:56 2015 UTC,"Its all about predictability.  I don't like vendors that mark shipped before its actually dropped - huge pet peeve with me.  But if its afterwards, perfectly okay.  Hell, I'm fine if they mark it days after actually dropping, but I prefer the way its marked to be consistent.  TSG, my old go to, always marked shipped the day he actually dropped.  Some other vendors will mark anywhere from 1-2 days after actually dropping, but they are clear in their profile that they drop in 24 hours, regardless of how or when its marked.  If a vendor is simply consistent, then no communication is necessary and I'll know when they drop it."

DarkNetMarkets,3dpi92,young_k,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:23:35 2015 UTC,Its nothing to do with the software you use (electrum) and everything to do with the miners/fees/spamload.
DarkNetMarkets,3dpi92,young_k,0,Sat Jul 18 16:49:15 2015 UTC,"Yes that's true. The reason I thought it relevant was bc of how the newer client seems to calculate the miner fee. On the older version you specified the fee. The newer one seems to do so behind the scenes. I haven't played around with it at all and am sure it is just a setting. But it's a different fee than before and I assume they do some calculation since it's not a nice round number. With other web wallets like Coinbase you can't specify the miner fee. Only reason I found it relevant. But yes, with the same timing and fee I would have had same outcome with any bitcoin client or wallet"
DarkNetMarkets,3dpi92,sapiophile,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:59:41 2015 UTC,"is it calculating the fee based on something? it would be interesting to see what they used to figure out the optimal fee to get normal transaction times...lately i've been doing .001, but that seems a bit excessive, normally, before i got impatient, i was doing .0005 (5x min), what statistics would it look at to calculate it?  edit: and i noticed that a long time ago you couldnt specify with coinbase or circle or alot of other places what miner fee to use...which is really a pain, especially when your dealing with ""stress tests"" or spam like we have lately...however i think coinbase increased the default even though you cant control/change it...cause the last few times, and once during a spam session, i saw it get confirms in less then an hour...but i may be wrong...an im not sure if it was permanent or just one of those flukes....or if it was even non-default..."
DarkNetMarkets,3dpi92,The_fire_bird,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:27:04 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm curious about - it seems to be different with each transaction I've made.  Before, you just put it in a fee to include, think it defaulted to .0002 IIRC.  But now, its a weird number.  So it does seem like its doing some sort of calculation to base it off of.  That would be AWESOME though to do optimal pricing.  I don't know enough about the nuances of BTC and transaction fees but almost everything has the concept of surge pricing during times of scarcity or high demand.  Don't see why this would be any different.  I agree that Coinbase may have increased their fees b/c prior it seemed like outgoing transactions took a while and they have also been faster lately it seems."
DarkNetMarkets,3dnma6,qqq31,12,Fri Jul 17 19:05:01 2015 UTC,Inform vendor of their mistake. You aren't obligated to go any further and they'll probably just be glad you told them.
DarkNetMarkets,3dnma6,Big_Daddy_Trucknutz,3,Fri Jul 17 19:09:02 2015 UTC,"Would they not have my address on file, if they've mailed out two packs? or is it that they probably sent the shipping information to two different ""shipping staff"" that they might have?"
DarkNetMarkets,3dnma6,whatisopsec,2,Fri Jul 17 19:10:38 2015 UTC,"Some keep records, some not. Just let them know that you received a second order. I would offer to reach a settlement about a partial payment, just because I believe that is the right thing to do (I once sent $2000 of BTC back to a vendor who accidentally sent them during a partial refund) but maybe let them know it'll take a little while and you'll need an encrypted address to send the coins to.  See if they still ask you to pay or if it's OK not to. Maybe give them a review saying they gave you free product if they let it go.  In the unlikely event they threaten you (heard about Montfort?) then that vendor saves addresses, and you would do the community a great service to eventually, anonymously let this community know about the vendor's misdeeds."
DarkNetMarkets,3dnma6,shulginsdankmeme,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:27:42 2015 UTC,"They probably just packaged up two. Maybe one day they sent one off and the next day didn't have your info removed so they thought they didn't send it out and sent another.   If they're proper vendors that don't keep addresses the second time they would have wiped it. Similar thing happened to me, but I sold some and paid the vendor back.

I've been quite pleased with the Skunk myself. The nugs were very dense and trimmed very well and left a nice white ash when smoked.

DarkNetMarkets,3do4zg,inkhead1,3,Fri Jul 17 21:27:07 2015 UTC,"first of all thanks for the review. I don't get too many reddit reviews but I don't mind and I don't really care, I'm not competing with anyone, I'm not trying to be 'the grateful dead family' (pssst...bs), I'm not trying to even get top dollar for my shrooms. I like growing shrooms and it helps pay the bills. It's a hobby not a living. My feedback is perfect because everyone gets more than what they pay for, and it makes me happy to make other people happy.   Glad your pack landed safely but I'm sorry to hear it took almost 5 days transit, that's a rarity. Nine out ten orders make it in 2-3 days. Also, I'm sorry I didn't respond to your question, it really was a hectic week. What I usually do is open up a tab on my browser for each user messages and answer them before moving to my order list. After answering messages I open a tab for each order go thru each one by one, confirm address, answer all questions or send suggestions/questions/comments/shout outs/whatever, then I move onto the next tab/next order. I dunno what the question was I didn't answer but next time send it in a pm too especially if it's a question that absolutely needs to be answered. Sometimes agora moves slow and I smoke weed, I try not to let shit slip thru the cracks but C'est la vie, no one can be perfect.   And most importantly I came here to address the visual barrier you claim to be lacking. You say    ""Visual Barrier: Nope ""   and,   ""It was vacuum sealed, but it was basically in a box in a box""   Well what exactly do you define a visual barrier as, respectfully? My stealth is as simple as it needs to be for shrooms and I will ad it to my vendor profile so everyone knows. Purista stealth: vacuum sealed, visual barrier (this may be anything from a manila envelope, a bubble envelope, a flat rate envelope, maybe even duct tape around the vacuum sealed bag), printed label, electronic postage, and clear tape. I'm not using MBBs, I'm not using decoys, and I'll always take suggestions or reasonable requests for custom stealth. In summation, I appreciate the review but I respectfully disagree with your claim there was no visual barrier because in the simplest possible terms a 'box (visual barrier) within a box' is exactly what it is.   Thank you for coming to reddit with your review and not being the guy that wrecks an exceptional vendor's feedback like some of these other assholes I've seen. Example: ""4/5 no decoy no mbb wtf I expect more than this"".   Good things -Purista"
DarkNetMarkets,3do4zg,PuristaShrooms,2,Sat Jul 18 01:38:28 2015 UTC,Sounds like a good hearted vendor right here.

DarkNetMarkets,3do4zg,JustAnotherGuyonDMs,2,Sat Jul 18 19:47:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the compliment.
DarkNetMarkets,3do4zg,PuristaShrooms,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:53:37 2015 UTC,"Hey there, didn't think you were on Reddit.  Anyways, I didn't know if the stealth was sufficient enough for shrooms or not, but it probably is. It just wasn't much different from the outside packaging, but if someone were gonna just peek inside, then it would be completely fine. I've had my fair share of orders, but first time ordering shrooms. I've never seen someone package it the way you did, but I'm sure it's completely acceptable. I think you're right though and I'll change it. As much as I've ordered, I have no clue as to what is enough and what isn't. I mean I guess nobody can be for sure, but considering you have plenty of orders completed at a flawless 5/5, I think you know what you're doing.  The only time I'd ever leave a review less than 5/5 on a the market is if I had an issue with the weight, product, etc. If I got my product and it's all good, then you deserve the 5/5. I feel like reddit reviews are a way to be more honest without having to hurt the vendor score. Because pretty much every vendor expects a 5/5, because putting a 3/5 or something can stray away buyers, especially if they don't check reddit or such.  Anyways, I'm completely happy so thanks again.  Edit: Oh and I did ask a couple questions but it was a little bit long of a message so I'm not worried. I don't exactly remember what I said but I did ask what the recommended dosage was? I've had experience with shrooms but some of the people these went to didn't know, and were asking. I figured it was the same as normal but I've heard of people taking particular strains and having big trips on less than 2g."
DarkNetMarkets,3do4zg,PuristaShrooms,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:08:31 2015 UTC,"""I've never seen someone package it the way you did""   I switch it up every week or so. Not sure what you got but I think you got the large flat rate inside the large flat rate. Some times I don't even use flat rates I'll use custom envelopes with flat rate shipping. But flat rate parcels come so many shapes and sizes so just about every week it's gonna be something new I'm trying. The most important part of stealth is the postage, imo. It's got to be electronic postage. Stamps and those little rectangle tracking labels are now red flags. Stampers are getting noticed I promise you that. E postage looks totally innocuous.  As for dosage the thing about shrooms is that they can be highly variable when it comes to potency. Especially my shrooms. My shrooms are what you call 'multi spore inoculations', meaning every shroom in the bag is not genetically identical. Think about growing weed...you can throw down a handful of seeds and get yourself a handful of plants that aren't genetically identical because they all grew from different seeds. Now think about making clones from a mother tree, every clone grows at the same rate and will end up producing buds that are uniform and identical. The same phenomenon applies to growing mushrooms. To get a pure specimen (clone) I've got to excise a piece of tissue from within the stem and culture it on agar, then transfer to a jar, and proceed to growing as usual. I never took the time to do that but I'm working on it now.   The reason I'm telling you this is because potency in mushrooms is very unpredictable, even more so in 'multi spore inoculated' shrooms because they are all growing at different rates and essentially producing different concentrations of psilocin/psilocybin. Even more so when you've got different strains in the mix. And even more so when you've got different grow teqs running at once. Even two mushrooms growing from the same substrate picked within an inch from each other can contain substantially different amount of psycoactives. To add even more variation to the potency conundrum each subsequent flush is more potent than the last. The first flush will always be the largest in quantity, but the weakest in potency. The second will be a lil smaller in quantity but the shrooms will be stronger than the first flush, and this trend will continue on flush after flush until the farm has stopped producing. So on the fifth or sixth flush you may only get a shroom or two or three pop up, but BOY HOWDY those will be at least one order of magnitude stronger than that first flush (I like to call those zingers). When you consume a zinger you'll know it.   Now consider all these variables and answer the question about dosage. Have you ever eatin some shrooms and one person trips balls and another person is like 'I'm not feeling shit I dunno'...where there you have your answer right above in the previous paragraph. The solution to the problem is simply TO MAKE A SOLUTION. Don't eat them, make a tea out of them and consume equivalent amounts with friends to ensure that everyone is one the same plane. Pro tip: clean the fuck out of your coffee maker and brew your shrooms the same way as you would brew coffee.   -Purista"

DarkNetMarkets,3do2kh,ShakeYoRumpa,3,Fri Jul 17 21:08:31 2015 UTC,"General rule of thumb: it's better to be safe than sorry. You have to remember it's a matter of hiding everything or getting busted; you can either spend the extra hour making sure everything is safe (i.e. in a place far from your household) or a few years in prison. The United States is not very forgiving. Any prosecutor will make the case against you as they're paid on how much they confiscate. If you're convicted, you add to their statistics that keeps their department funded, which increases their paycheck. Remember, always be safer than sorry. Anything that spooks you, go clean and have a peace of mind."

We also had the market exit scams that put the entire community in disarray, which probably motivated vendors to scam, either to make their money back or to build a nice bonus before getting out in this mess. More users also mean more idiots and underage teenagers that have no clue how to buy right.  I came into the scene after the demise of SR1, Sheep, and BMR. When Agora started up, even before Evo, and started getting huge, that I have to say was the best time to buy. Easy to find legacy vendors from SR1, to verify them, not as many fly by night, etc."

DarkNetMarkets,3dmj7d,LoudRooster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:42:02 2015 UTC,"Freebase is vaping. If you smoke your DMT, it will destroy the molecule, so you have to vaporize it in a freebase pipe by holding the lighter a distance away. Freebasing leads to a very intense 5-10 minute high, while Ayahuasca is a multi-hour, gradual, more traditional psychedelic."

Whos 115us tabs and 200ug tabs do you think BlueViking is selling? TGUK sells more acid in a couple of hours than all those guys in a week. I dont think they are even on TGUK's radar. They are no longer competition for TGUK. Look through there online shops and see with your own eyes. Instrument is a TGUK re-seller as well

Also if I'm such a hateful person, then why would I order from a TGUK reseller in the US? I'm sure he has good product, that's why I want to try his stuff but his own personal customer service and him as a person I don't not want to deal with, he's a very rude person.

DarkNetMarkets,3dotco,lemonbreak,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:01:32 2015 UTC,"More than likely you would be okay ordering from another vendor, BUT personally, I'd first try to explain what happened to this pack.  I've had a DNM pack take about 12 days to get to me.  With this vendor, I'd normally get the pack in 2 days, maybe 3.  I messaged the vendor about 7 days out, tracking showed it disappeared off tracking at Day 2.  It was picked up and went to the vendor's local post depot and then vanished.  On about Day 9 it showed back up on tracking in the wrong state - a state that it would normally not go through.  After that, it showed up in a couple of days.  Think it just got mis-routed, then apparently lost b/c it didn't pick up for over a week on tracking.    It happens.  I've had this happen a number of times on clearnet packs with USPS.  More than likely this is the cause.  But that being said, there was a recent post about love letter they got for some weed as well.  Have the vendor provide tracking and check what's going on.  More than likely its misrouted.    Whether or not its safe to order again is up to your risk tolerance.  I'd say statistically you are fine b/c statistically the pack is simply mis-routed.  Even if you were to get a love letter, while I'd be burning my drop, others have successfully ordered after love letters for a while.  All about your risk tolerance.  Personally, I first like to explain any missing packs to understand what I'm dealing with.  This should only take a few days, assuming the vendor gets back to you in a timely manner."

DarkNetMarkets,3dnjon,adamtancredi,2,Fri Jul 17 18:45:12 2015 UTC,"Dose: 125mcg Xtal: California GDF fluff Duration: 8-10 hours    Took a tab to test the product. An hour went by and I felt nothing. Was starting to think I got bunk but it eventually hit. The comeup was very subtle and gradual. The word ""clean"" comes to mind. I normally get some body load so this was a welcome departure from the status quo. Before I know it, I'm full out tripping.  Whoa. I don't normally get OEVs at 125mcg so I'm very impressed. I spend a couple hours in my backyard enjoying the afternoon sun and staring at my trees. Normally, when I take a low dose of LSD, I suffer from more confusion and headfuck, making the trips almost manic. whereas a higher dose (200mcg+) would blast me to a calm, content state of being. The latter was what I felt during this trip. I liken the feeling to normally living my life in foggy/cloudy weather, with the acid lifting me above all the fog and clouds. Everything is more clear and beautiful, and I see it all from a new perspective. Small worries and issues become trivial, and I rediscover the truly important aspects of living a fulfilling life.  Overall, it was one of the smoothest and  most enjoyable LSD trips I've ever had. I look forward to dropping a higher dose this weekend."

Unfortunately freshly cured weed should still be ""burped"" (container it's in opened) at least once daily, so a lot of shipped weed tastes and smells like hay/beasters/grass-clippings by the time it gets to the buyer. Long-cured,dry weed doesn't suffer nearly as much, but growers prefer to get rid of it long before that. 5-10% (lost) water weight adds up quick when you're talking pounds."

An important distinction needs to be made here.  In all likelihood, that warrant will be an Anticipatory Warrant.  The execution of an anticipatory warrant is dependent upon LE establishing Probable Cause prior to entering the target premises.  Unless or until they can they do that, the warrant is unenforceable.    Ways to establish PC:  Accepting the parcel(thereby taking possession) gives them PC.  Signing for a parcel = PC.  Acknowledging or admitting you have knowledge that the parcel contains contraband = PC.  If you come home to find the parcel sitting at your door and LE observes you taking it inside...they now have PC."

DarkNetMarkets,3dkxdn,UMDZete,0,Fri Jul 17 12:38:45 2015 UTC,"I think this is good advice.  There is always fierce debate on signing vs. not signing.  I guess deep down we'd all like to believe some simple technicality would stop LE or bad things from happening.  Here's the way I look at it, simple outcomes.  The signature is required either b/c they are attempting a CD OR they are not and its something innocent.  Looking at strict probabilities, the chances are astronomically that its something innocent.  By not signing, you are almost guaranteeing LE to seize the pack.  Now, the big question is, if it is part of a CD/seizure, would not signing offer any protections?  I tend to agree with you that it would not.  If LE is going to bust you, a stupid signature won't stop them.  They'll find a way to execute the warrant.  Bottom line, not signing almost guarantees you that the pack will be seized by LE.  Signing is not an admission of guilt.  Keep a clean drop and they still have to prove the case.  If only it were as easy as refusing to sign...  Anyway, I agree with you.  Probably half the folks here won't.  And that's fine.  At the end of the day, we all have to do what's right for us.  You can offer advice and reason and logic and its we each have to be comfortable with our actions.  But this, along with question of  tumbling, is like religion and/or politics.  People get all heated on both sides, very few people ""change sides"", but its good advice for newbies who need both sides of the argument."

Or spell out ""Street"", ""Avenue"", et cetra on one, abbreviate with the other vendor: ""St"", ""Ave"", etc.  There are a lot of different ways to do it, this will make it easy for you to link orders to vendors."

DarkNetMarkets,3dm4er,guccimane420,6,Fri Jul 17 11:28:07 2015 UTC,"Walmart has them for pretty cheap. 11$ inc. tax for a 1 strip (thc for example).  Walgreen have a 11 test for 40$ (39.99 bs).  What do you need it for?... Opps! Read the thread!!!  Okay so the way that these tests work is they usually test for what is known in chemistry as a 'moiety', this is the 'skeleton signiture' of the drug being tested. Per example, The Erlich test uses the tryptamine moiety as reference to determine if LSD is present (because ETH-LAD and 1P also contain this moiety, they also turn purple in the test. See what I mean? Read further). MDxx use the 3,4 subbed Phenethylamine as reference. They usually contain a mixture of acids and work similar in dumbed down concept to a dip stick PH testing moiety - the color change is due to a similar affect.  Now while these tests can tell you, to a LESSER DEGREE of certainty what class of drug you are ingesting, you will really never know with 99% accuracy (we never say 100 in organic) that your compound is out there. Just like in hip hop, there are a LOT of 'false positives', substances that react with the moiety like a gook from Vietnam hiding in the deep forest.  My reccomendation is to use a marqui (for most phenethylamines and even others), and an Enrich for Tryptamines (pretty accurate).  Without a GC or LC/MS confirm, one can truly never know with certainty that a chemical is the one they are looking for. They can know with a 'hope and prayer like' certainty that it is in the class they are looking for.  However, combined with a MP (Melting Point) test and or a burn test (remember how in Gen Chem you put some simple solutions of molecules like NaOH4 over a bunsen and saw the color change as the valence electrons got excited? Similar concept) and the Melting point, depending on the salt, should be within 2 degress of the Merck index for the compound, assuming it is > 90% pure.  These two or three techniques can be powerful to the non chemist voyager, and I suggest them to all.  PS - drug test control testing for the most part won't work, as they use a completely different technique and generally test for metabolites of the substance.  If anyone needs some more advice on testing let me know! :)  We all need to stay safe."

DarkNetMarkets,3dnser,jmypetersen,2,Fri Jul 17 19:50:12 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, it is a little on the long side in the mail system but not unheard.  There could be several factors at play, I don't know the vendor much aside from hearing of the name, I think there are 2 vendors with this name IIRC - one uses a Z, the other an S.  I can't remember which, but one of them was known for longer ship times if I'm not mistaken.    But you don't actually know when the vendor dropped.  Some vendors lie or aren't completely upfront about hte actual drop time.  Did they give you a tracking number?  Without knowing for sure when it was actually sent, it may just be en route.  If you are worried about a seizure, I think its too early for that.  At most, its 7 days in transit.  Not unheard of.  I've had shit that was in state take 5-6 days and shit across the country take 2 days.  All depends logistically how you fall on the transit routes, when the pack was actually dropped, etc.  Bottom line - I wouldn't be worried about a seizure or anything like that quite yet.  I'd definitely ask him what the deal is and provide tracking or check tracking for you though."

I'd say if you don't get it by tomorrow's mail, write the vendor.  Being in the same state should be quick, but Texas is a big state, its possible that one or both of you don't live near major hubs or something.

Also what do you think about Kratom? A friend used it a while back while he had a full blown dope habbit, said it worked a little, but I wonder how it is on somebody with a low / no tolerence."
DarkNetMarkets,3dlycg,PenetratorHammer,2,Fri Jul 17 13:03:26 2015 UTC,"I have a pretty high tolerance to it now, but starting out, at proper doses it feels almost indistinguishable from a strong opiate -- like 40mg oxy (if you have a medium-level tolerance to opiates). For someone with little or no opioid tolerance kratom would probably hit like a couple of vicodin or percocet on small doses, and would probably be nauseating at higher doses. It's pretty amazing really that it's stayed legal for as long as it has -- knock on wood. I never used it specifically to kick dope, but I did have a pretty good dope/pill habit for quite a while and it's honestly a great substitute. As good or better than methadone/suboxone IMO. With all that said, you build a tolerance really fucking quick, so you gotta take breaks or dose smaller and less frequently than you'd like to."
DarkNetMarkets,3dlycg,GrandMasta216,2,Fri Jul 17 13:18:59 2015 UTC,I noticed if you switch the strains you use then tolerance should not be an issue. It seems you only build a tolerance to the specific alkaloids in each strain.
DarkNetMarkets,3dlycg,PenetratorHammer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:17:06 2015 UTC,"There's a good amount of truth to that I think. Maybe it's possible to set up a rotation such that you continually dodge tolerance, but I haven't figured it out yet, and from what I've read it's not 100% anyway; definitely worth experimenting with though for sure."

DarkNetMarkets,3dlycg,PenetratorHammer,2,Fri Jul 17 13:44:43 2015 UTC,"My go-to method for ingesting it is to just parachute it. I 'chute like 2-3g -- i.e. a hefty teaspoon's worth -- 2x. It's the easiest method I've found so far.   I haven't felt sick recently, but I have occasionally. I'd drink ginger ale or milk, and/or take some pepto tablets and that would usually work. Most times I've felt nauseated though were when I'd taken quite a lot (15g+).   I don't really fuck with extracts anymore.

DarkNetMarkets,3dli49,Rolltripdance,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:56:15 2015 UTC,Can 2cb be take the day after mdma or vice versa? I assume there will be cross tolerance so I am trying to schedule my drug use accordingly. Sounds kind of pathetic actually but I know it's gonna be a blast

Sadly I can't attend any this summer :( but next year I'll get back to them :)  Yes 2cb can be taken the day of MDMA, and the day after. Since the festival you are going to is likely a 3 day camp out (I assume), just do all the drugs you want IMO. Some may disagree with me, but in my opinion, and the opinion of many this is the way to do it. At bisco one year, I remember this one dude had a vial. I was trading him nitrous for dose, and one time I asked him. I says are you excited to see so and so. He said I ain't seeing shit, I just came here to get fucked up with my friends in a field in new york for 3 days. I says hell yeah. hah;)  So I wouldn't worry about drug cross tolerance. I took acid 2 days in a row there and tripped harder the second day. And I took mdma 2 nights in a row. Remember, by day 3 or night 3 you are going to be tired, so make sure you take a friend with the yayo. And do all the good drugs on the first two days!  Have fun!"

DarkNetMarkets,3dli49,thegallantone,0,Mon Jul 20 03:14:39 2015 UTC,"Very good point sir. The alcohol would probably cost about 2 fold what you are spending on drugs. I can't see it being more then 2-300 for the personal side of things, unless you are bringing bags for friends or have a girlfriend. In that case make them chip in ;)  I think the bag of heroin is a great idea, personally. Nothing like a few bumps to take the edge off, or take a comedown away. Me and my girlfriend would do shots of it every night at fests, mind you we were a little bit into it at the time, but I found it comforting and relaxing. I'm not sure many people don't :)"

DarkNetMarkets,3dkb4y,damnmachine,11,Fri Jul 17 02:34:54 2015 UTC,"One advantage of FE is you don't have to get on and release escrow when the package arrives.    What difference does that make you say?  Say LE is monitoring the market server like they did with Silk Road.  They could potentially work with USPS to match up delivery dates of packages with realsing escrow on the markets.    Example.  On Thursday July 16th your 100 grams of MDMA arrives from Germany.  You login right away to release escrow on July 16th.  If LE is monitoring server they can see that.  They may already know that such and such a vendor shipped out a bunch of packages because they already profiled him and have been monitoring outgoing packages building a case.  They watch his market account.  They watch him making drops.  They connect the dots and build their case.    If you FE there's no connection to be made based on when your package arrives and when you release escrow.  The same principal holds true for vendors who wait a couple of days to ship.  Itewqq comes to mind.  If LE places an order with him, they'll have a harder time putting the pieces of the puzzle together because he delayed shipment.  Vendors who scramble to get orders out fast have the benefit of happier customers and faster payment but risk a bit more in terms of OPSEC.    Look, I have no evidence this is happening.  But LE typically work behind the scences to gather evidence and build a case before they make their move.  My grandpa had a saying that always stuck with me.  He said ""you don't know what you don't know.""  Think about that for a second.  Play it safe.  If you don't mind risking your money, FE may just give you a little bit more security so you don't have to follow up and login to relase your escrow.    tl;dr FE is bad because you risk losing money, but good because you don't have to login to release escrow and in the process indicate to whoever might be watching that you did in fact receive drugs in the mail today"

If you think about it, each vendor is essentially ""fronting you"" each package until however many days later you finalize, at least as far as supplies/finances go on his hand. In the real world, you hand your dealer the money AND THEN he hands you the drugs. And if you're not happy with it for some reason, you do not get your money back the way you can on the darknet.

DarkNetMarkets,3dj3dv,cookiesNkush,3,Thu Jul 16 21:48:55 2015 UTC,Amphetamine actually. The last thing i want are benzos. Those make all of this much much worse in the end. I prefer hyperawareness over a feeling of general calmness. Then after that we slam a huge dose of either dmt or a phenythylamine class hallucinogen. Broadens that amphetamine narrowed horizon. Weeeeeeeeeeeeee roller coaster!
DarkNetMarkets,3dj3dv,hog_master,3,Thu Jul 16 21:01:53 2015 UTC,Preferably 2ce or some MHRByuasca!

DarkNetMarkets,3dj3dv,hog_master,2,Fri Jul 17 00:56:12 2015 UTC,No no no baby. 2ce. Look it up. 12 hour duration and the most vivid hallucinogenic experience ive ever experienced.
DarkNetMarkets,3dj3dv,hog_master,2,Fri Jul 17 01:32:03 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah I know it well. Had many a life changing nights on it. Beautiful chemical. Also the most potent of the 2c's I've tried, still waiting for the thio's though. Have you fucked with them?  I love 2cb though. Nice short duration, and one of the few... actually one of the many, but the most consistant phen that has made my ribs hurt from laughing and my face hurt from smiling so much.  You can actually have ego death on it. A unique ego death at that. One time the chem made me literally fall down from laughing at some dumb shit. I love it. I take heroic doses though. Shulgin says don't go above 20 i think. Pft. 40+ where it's at, just gotta lay down during the come up.  Then again, Shulgin also said that Ketamine isn't a drug that can be learned from. While I respect his chemistry, I don't consider him a God like authority."
DarkNetMarkets,3dj3dv,hog_master,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:45:04 2015 UTC,I will have to try this 2cb especially since the other 2cx are rare all of a sudden. Its possuble Shulgin has the same distaste for disassociated states that i do. I find it hard to learn when im distracted bythe fact that my body is no longer there.
DarkNetMarkets,3dj3dv,Danksalmon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:51:47 2015 UTC,"Yes please do! Thank me later ;)  Both are in his ""Magical half dozen"", E and B. I feel the same way about all the other 2c's being rare, guess most people are into dose or smoke or dope or cokes. Not to say they aren't awesome, but they make more money for sure. Have you ever tried any other 2c's? I done E (awesome), B (fav), C (beautiful), F (weird), 25i-n-benzoyl-ortho-methoxy (nBOME), 25b, and I believe that's it. Really wanting to try the Thio series. And maybe one day some of the 3 carbon analouges, teh DOx series.   That's interesting about your point on dissascoiatives, I agree - I only like K, and I love to K hole hard. Nothing like an out of body experience. Truly unique and serene. While I agree they may be harder to gain from, the gains one can receive are monumental. I have no taste for MXE anymore or PCP.   Opiates can also be learned from in my experience. The dream like nod is a beautiful state. I think most drugs can be learned/gained from, but the phens have a special place in my heart for it, displaced only by K imo.  I'd like to hear your take."
DarkNetMarkets,3dj3dv,Danksalmon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:04:41 2015 UTC,"I met my fiance while tripping on nbome for the first time. My take is that anything can be learned from, but you have to make sure that learning isnt actually escapism. I use amphetamine to escape and to serve my ego. I use phen hallucinogens to worship my ""god"". I use LSD to escape and dance with the vibrations of the universe. I had a thing for DXM at one point. I learned from that that space and time go infinitely in both directions and that no matter where you stood perception is always subjective based on what is being looked at. Opiates are something i would love to be on 24/7 but, like with benzos, i find that all the pain just comes back as intensely as before. I smoke weed to quiet my soul, and i drink to drown my sorrows. My depression manifests as something like fibromyalgia. I wish i could control methamphetamine, but tina is a monster and she will destroy me if we play again.   In summary: i love altered mindstates. It takes away the pain or enhances the pain. Either way the pain is different and it gives me a break for just a little while."

Now someone else has done it for and you will probably pass this assignment but what do you do when you will have to write the next essay? Writing this 6 page essay would have been a good practise for you and I doubt that the requirements for passing were very high since it seems to be an essay for beginners. The next essay will have much higher requirements and it will be a pain in the ass for you to write it since you lack the knowledge about writing essays that you should have gotten by writing the first essay.
