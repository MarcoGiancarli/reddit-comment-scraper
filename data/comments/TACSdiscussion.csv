One trying to rub her ass on me and another flashing her tits, and Rat was shunning himself like a shamed Amish.  He's gay and doesn't know it or want to be out yet."

Girls were really interested in me too back then but I would always freeze up and start flushing, heart beating out of my chest, and that kind of thing. It was like having a panic attack in a way but instead of feeling impending doom I was more overwhelmed by a girl I liked giving me attention and possibly getting physical. Maybe Rat is still in that phase at age 23 due to not having any peer pressure and surrounding his life with Late night talk shows. Or maybe he's just a queer."

He had the good sense not to actually doxx the guy, but why go through the trouble of doing this in the first place when he could have just blocked him? This was an excessive and unnecessary strong arm move. He talked about it on his show like it was an acceptable thing to do immediately after Soder just finished explaining how rattled he was when he got doxxed. He said it was a worse feeling than having a gun put to his head and Anthony's response was ""I did that to a guy this weekend"". There's a weird disconnect there. I'm not going to unsubscribe and I'll continue to support the show/network, but sometimes you have to call a spade a spade. If the guy was threatening Anthony that'd be one thing, I could almost empathize and see why he would do it if that were the case, but as of now it just seems like he was trolling him."

You have no idea what the exchange was between the two, but considering the TITLE of this thread.. is it that far fetched that somebody went to far and kept harassing someone from either show just to get a rise out them? Just because Ant didn't give you hens every fucking detail of what was said, and considering he's been taking shit from haters pretty much ever since he's been on the air.. I am going to go out on a limb and say that whoever it was fucking with him, said and did a whole lot more than just fuck with him about his performance at the roast."
TACSdiscussion,3e2dbb,KNUCKKLEFUCKER,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:47:33 2015 UTC,That's why there's a block button on Twitter. Pulling up someone's info (probably enough to make is 'scary') to seem tough is really really stupid.
TACSdiscussion,3e2dbb,Phantas_Magorical,-2,Tue Jul 21 19:41:40 2015 UTC,I'm on the OnA sub a lot and I don't really give a shit that Ant did that. It's just nitpicking.

TACSdiscussion,3e2dbb,DeafandMutePenguin,4,Tue Jul 21 13:20:51 2015 UTC,One of Ant's whore leeches claims said she has screencapped the threats but never posted them. I asked her to so maybe we'll get to see it. Either way I don't think he'd actually have posted it publicly. It just made him look like the thin skinned ass he is once again.

You might disagree but plenty of others see it that way, although I must say the sub has turned into the Colosseum, but that's half the fun. A lot of the circular hate wagon is kind of an in joke."
TACSdiscussion,3e2dbb,kimchifart,11,Tue Jul 21 19:42:31 2015 UTC,Ant deserves to get shit on because he really isn't upping his game and I hope the studio fixes that but also it's clear some bigger group of angry trolls and alternate accounts have invaded O&A and completely changed the narrative and they are so blatantly obvious because there is a lot more pro-Opie stuff now. Like if there was ant-Opie and Ant i'd be like ok both are hated now but clearly some outside force is trying to redirect the narrative. Call me tinfoil but the sheer amount of upvotes don't represent the actual amount of discussion going on.

TACSdiscussion,3e2dbb,Mitchull,6,Tue Jul 21 14:04:37 2015 UTC,You could argue it's possible behind the scenes OP fucked Ant over during the whole firing process since they hated each other so much. No proof of course but the way they treat each other I do not believe he defended him at all.

TACSdiscussion,3dze8o,DeafandMutePenguin,2,Tue Jul 21 13:25:07 2015 UTC,Yesterday's show was good.  He had a comic with him the whole time and stayed away from race talk.  Like my comment says.. everyone loves funny Anthony and gets annoyed with/bored with Ant making the same points about race over and over.  Yesterday was a show where he stayed away from the shit that annoys a lot of his fans and it was a great show.

TACSdiscussion,3dze8o,CheesyGoodness,0,Tue Jul 21 15:45:12 2015 UTC,The person who was doxxed made a thread in the O&A sub where he posted some screen shots of their exchange.. It doesn't look great for Ant.
TACSdiscussion,3dze8o,kgt5003,0,Tue Jul 21 15:49:20 2015 UTC,"The thing is, Ant didn't make anything public, so this person was not doxxed.  Honestly, if you want to talk shit about someone in public, you should a) be prepared to back it up and b) don't whine and cry like a little bitch when the person you talked shit about calls you out.  Whoever this is, he thinks this is his 10 minutes of internet fame, but it looks like he's a little crybaby."
TACSdiscussion,3dze8o,CheesyGoodness,2,Tue Jul 21 17:34:33 2015 UTC,I agree that when you spend all day trashing people online you are eventually going to run into a problem but Jesus Christ this is a bit overboard for somebody just hurting your feelings.

TACSdiscussion,3dze8o,kgt5003,2,Tue Jul 21 14:15:08 2015 UTC,"Well, there hasn't been much race talk on the show for almost three weeks now."
TACSdiscussion,3dze8o,Opieisgod,-3,Tue Jul 21 15:31:31 2015 UTC,No there 's something beyond that.  The recent Ant hate in the O&A sub is very reminiscent of the peak of the Opie hate- a couple sock puppet accounts just posting the same crap over and over and over.  Its like they got bored with Opie and are now turning on Ant.
TACSdiscussion,3dze8o,jakdak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:19:22 2015 UTC,There are way more sock puppets now than in the Opie hate heyday. Go look at the account ages in the top threads there. Some people have been creating socks like crazy since April.

Oh yeah, and it's torture to listen to Ant talk politics/race when you don't agree with him. Joe Rogan had a former BPD cop on his podcast who completely contradicts everything Ant spews. Lets be honest here, he's a racist (its a character!). A funny racist, I can deal with, and even love.

I think they're getting laughs with SJW trolling but I maybe wrong. It's becoming spam over there at this point but it'll die down late August. I'll keep my eyes on it though because it's intriguing to see once normal users become influenced, or maybe they're taking the piss also.

Recently, though, some evidence has emerged indicating that a rare allele of the MAOA gene-that is, the 2-repeat allele-may have effects on violence that are independent of the environment. The current study builds on this research and examines the association between the 2-repeat allele and shooting and stabbing behaviors in a sample of males drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Analyses revealed that African-American males who carry the 2-repeat allele are significantly more likely than all other genotypes to engage in shooting and stabbing behaviors and to report having multiple shooting and stabbing victims."""

Ant has said he's done it with crazies and stalkers in the past.  Found out who they were from his cop friends in case something happens.

TACSdiscussion,3e2zbc,IAmVictoriaAMA,0,Tue Jul 21 17:37:19 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine that if the guy was mouthing off on Twitter and making personal attacks, then he's not going to be stupid enough to have his personal info linked to the same account - and probably just used a made up username on Twitter.    I think that it's possible that the guy's Twitter handle/username was the same as his username on anthonycumia.com, as there aren't any websites that could legally make your phone number, address and full name available to the public without your knowledge and consent.     But, Ant said he found it through ""public record"", so maybe the guy used the same username he had on Twitter on other sites, then you could do a Google search to include only that username. If it's an odd or uncommon username then it wouldn't be too hard to find, and maybe on other sites he made his name visible. From that, Ant could get Keith the Cuck to find out his personal info pretty easily I'd imagine."
TACSdiscussion,3e2zbc,DoubleGuns,0,Tue Jul 21 17:50:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that might be how he did it. Once you have someone's real name, you don't need to be an ex-cop or a hacker to figure out their address and phone number. You just need a few bucks to pay to see all their information on one of those directory websites. Sometimes not even that if your google-fu is strong."

If the guy actually did that he deserves to be doxxed.  Ant only said the guy was being threatening after he started taking shit for saying he DMed the guy all of his personal info.

TACSdiscussion,3e1f1b,kgt5003,0,Tue Jul 21 12:15:29 2015 UTC,"That's one way of looking at it. But it seems as like it was more threatening. He's been tweeting about it all night. Even in the video he kind of says it around 1:18. I mean, the amount of shit he was getting about bombing, this one guy stood out enough for him to go digging.

TACSdiscussion,3e1f1b,xoemoscrubxo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:21:28 2015 UTC,Ant sure thought it was a hoot when his fans would make personal attacks on other radio guys and girls during jocktober.  Poor Terry Clifford probably still has Vietnam-like flashbacks to some of the shit she was taking after the show spent hours trashing her for being overweight and unattractive.  Now Anthony is going to complain when some guy on twitter tells him his jokes weren't funny?  That's too personal?
TACSdiscussion,3e1f1b,kgt5003,0,Tue Jul 21 12:24:13 2015 UTC,What does the fact that it is a public facebook page have to do with anything?  The guy tweeted to Anthony (which twitter is public) and then Anthony decided attacking his jokes was personal and dug up the person's actual information and sent it to him as a threat.  How is posting a personal attack on somebody's facebook page OK but tweeting a personal attack over twitter is somehow crossing a line?  If Ant didn't want to hear this guys shit he could have just blocked him.  Fuckin problem solved.  And you are saying I'm stupid?
TACSdiscussion,3e1f1b,kgt5003,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:39:43 2015 UTC,"Twitter and Facebook don't HAVE to be public. You don't have to use your real name. If you use you real name, you shouldn't be surprised that people you piss off on one platform are able to access your other public accounts tied to your real name. That's assuming that this guy did use his real name for Twitter; if not, and if Ant got his personal info by other means, then that's a different story."
TACSdiscussion,3e1f1b,IAmVictoriaAMA,2,Tue Jul 21 10:23:41 2015 UTC,So how is posting a personal attack on twitter different than posting a personal attack on facebook?

TACSdiscussion,3e1f1b,kgt5003,2,Tue Jul 21 11:58:04 2015 UTC,Well he said on the show to Dan Soder that he did this because the guy was giving him shit about the roast.  It wasn't until he started taking shit from the fans that he decided to say that the guy was actually being abusive and threatening... if that is the case why not just send out those tweets and prove it.  If the guy was actually threatening Ant then fuck the guy.  Ant should do what he did.
TACSdiscussion,3e1f1b,kgt5003,6,Tue Jul 21 12:10:08 2015 UTC,"I find it very believable that he was threatened.  The fans have already showed they don't understand where the line is.  So right now I believe he was threatened so his actions are reasoned (he didn't doxx because no information was released publicly).  Now, if it comes out he wasn't threatened then yeah, fuck him.  But the O&A subreddit is jumping to conclusions (shock)."
TACSdiscussion,3e1f1b,DeafandMutePenguin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:12:41 2015 UTC,"I don't.  I bet the guy was bashing him about his roast bomb and he wouldn't stop.  I HIGHLY doubt the guy threatened him and if he did, post the screenshots because he definitely has them so he can show the judge when it's time to renew his gun permit.  I'll bet that he has Keith make up a fake name and threaten him, ant will post those and cut the date off."
TACSdiscussion,3e1f1b,kevin121312,0,Tue Jul 21 17:58:05 2015 UTC,Well now you're admitting that you don't know what happened because you DOUBT the guy threatened him.  No certainty.  Why should he post them?  To quiet a small minority on a subreddit?  What good would it do?  You're already jumping into conspiracy theories about them faking any proof you're asking for.
TACSdiscussion,3e1f1b,DeafandMutePenguin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:19:40 2015 UTC,"Huh?  Ant said that he was personally attacked.  I'd like to see what the guy said to him.  I still think ant is a bitch for doing what he did.  If ant WAS threatened and can prove it, then he's still a bitch for making the guy delete his twitter and not going to the police.  Sadly, the the amount of posters on this sub are probably 1/2 of ant's listenership."
TACSdiscussion,3e1f1b,kevin121312,-1,Tue Jul 21 12:21:55 2015 UTC,"Ant said the guy took it farther than personal attacks.  Others on twitter who saw the tweets said they were threats.    Ant didn't say he made the guy delete the twitter.  The guy claiming to be the one doxxed claimed that and his proof is a ""long time coming"" and looks fake as a lot of posters are pointing out.  Now you are making a judgment about his listenership, again without any information.  You are a cunt."
TACSdiscussion,3e1f1b,DeafandMutePenguin,2,Tue Jul 21 12:25:36 2015 UTC,"Then ant should post the tweets.  If they went further that personal attacks, you go to the cops, you don't threaten to post personal info.  Keith, is this you?"
TACSdiscussion,3e1f1b,kevin121312,-1,Tue Jul 21 12:22:06 2015 UTC,They were deleted as referenced by others on twitter.  So Ant could only post them if he took screenshots.  No I'm clearly not Keith.
TACSdiscussion,3e1f1b,DeafandMutePenguin,2,Tue Jul 21 12:23:34 2015 UTC,"You don't think Ant took screenshots of threatening messages, if only to show the judge when it's time to renew his pistol permit?"
TACSdiscussion,3e1f1b,kevin121312,-1,Tue Jul 21 12:32:18 2015 UTC,"It's possible but not probable.  I also think he doesn't owe anything to the commenters of reddit so even if he did have them it's his own personal decision to post them here or not.  What his story does do is serve as a warning to the fans on here, twitter, wackbag, etc not to show up to his house and not to issue any threats to him."

TACSdiscussion,3e05jc,JohnTravoltasHair,8,Mon Jul 20 22:59:08 2015 UTC,I think this sub has now changed its mind and the official stance now is that Ant did indeed not bomb!

He clearly bombed. And it was really awkward and funny. Like those old terrible Jim Norton sets, or Vos's old comedy. But even more awkward. Better than a forgettable good 8 minutes up there. Look at all the drama it's caused."
TACSdiscussion,3e05jc,SAHandre,0,Tue Jul 21 10:20:44 2015 UTC,Yeah I was just kidding but your thread got voted down to zero. I even tried to give you an upvote and it's still zero. So it would seem there is some truth to my joke about this sub changing its stance on whether or not Anthony bombed.
TACSdiscussion,3e05jc,SAHandre,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:29:16 2015 UTC,"It's simply been invaded by people that don't like the show. They're old Opie and Anthony fans or whatever and they're expecting the wrong show. They'll be around for a while.  In regards to the few pro-Anthony (which I'm not, I'm unbiased and more interested in Gavin - simply not an hysterical hater/ball washer) threads I made staying around 0, if you click on the ""controversial"" filter they were top all yesterday. Because so many people were voting up, or down. Keep it's vote almost zero, but it's position on the board high.  That just speaks to how divided the board is right now. But in a month. Or two. Or a year. They'll be gone. Anthony will be just as rich, the network will still exist, and those upset people will of found something else to enjoy. It's as old as it is predictable. And they'll vote this comment down not just because they disagree with it, but because that fact actively bothers them."
TACSdiscussion,3e05jc,AzraelApollyon,0,Tue Jul 21 10:33:25 2015 UTC,"I'm all in favor of ant as long as he does funny shows, like yesterday's dan soder episode. I got no complaints apart from both of them talking about him not bombing, but whatever. Other than that it was great. If he goes down the path of trying to be a political pundit, then I don't care if he fails because I wouldn't be watching anymore. Right now I'm hoping the NYC studio will allow for more appearences from funny comics so I do think he's on the right track."
TACSdiscussion,3e05jc,SAHandre,0,Tue Jul 21 10:48:54 2015 UTC,"His funny shows way outnumber his none-funny shows. And I don't care. Ant is intelligent and can hold a conversation on many different subjects. I'm not 9. I don't need to just laugh all day every day. I can listen and enjoy interesting political talk, too.  Not every O&A show was Vos, Bobby, Colin and Patrice. There were ALOT of duds in there. Nothing has changed other than peoples expectations and distorted memories from people who weren't real fans, and their knowledge comes from all the very best shows uploaded on YT. When you do multiple shows a week the quality is always going to be inconsistent.   The studio will help get way more comedians in, though, which will be to the benefit of everybody who moans right now. Although mark my words - they will just find something else to moan about. It is endless. Untill they get bored. Look what happened to Joe Rogan. These same types of people went and set up reddit.com/r/joerogan2/ that is where these people are heading."

He also demanded the removal from his show of those commercials they ran during Stern and Opie and Anthony saying they were too immoral for his show even though ads for snake oil products were his mainstay sponsors on terrestrial radio for years.

Not an overload of guests like YKWD but SOMEONE, anyone. Now, none of those shows do 4 shows a week like Ant but is it too much to ask that he books a decent guest or roundtable for 2 days out of each week? For those days where Ant is by himself, then do the look-into-the-camera setup. But otherwise, some kind of roundtable would be nice. And then just riff and bullshit about things.   As far as material goes I'd really like it if Ant stopped talking about his twitter, and cut down the news stories. We get it, guns and blacks. We know his viewpoints on these subjects. We know the PC liberals are ruining the media and civil discourse in this country. Just cut it down a bit, will ya? Gavin does a better show, though a very similar one, because he keeps things structured and doesn't ruminate on a single subject for too long. Every episode of Gavin's show feels like he gets something done. Each one so far has felt distinguishable from the other episodes.   I know Ant is just going to do what he wants and thinks is best so idk why I'm bothering.

TACSdiscussion,3dqjbg,SledgeBammer,2,Sat Jul 18 22:31:31 2015 UTC,"With the show coming from the studio, Anthony should revive Live from the Compound.  This would give him an outlet for his race rants and thus help TACS stay a little more on target and a little more mainstream."

TACSdiscussion,3docmi,Opieisgod,13,Fri Jul 17 22:28:58 2015 UTC,"I'm of the same opinion. Ant was mostly fodder, and some of the best jokes of the night were at his expense.   Also, I watched his set again, and it was much less excruciating the second time around. Not good, but not as bad as it was painted in my memory. He definitely got them back at the end a little bit."

TACSdiscussion,3docmi,Heifsin85,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:17:26 2015 UTC,"Ant is great fodder. Some of the other comics on the dais simply aren't as easily targeted as Ant. Like you don't have that much to work with when it comes to Vecchione, Soder and Normand. Ant is old, ugly, racist, dates teenage girls, and had a messy falling out with his former co-host. Out of all the people involved in that roast, Ant was probably the easiest to write for. Low-hanging fruit if you will."
TACSdiscussion,3docmi,burner989,8,Sat Jul 18 15:14:14 2015 UTC,"Definitely a great roast.   I don't think Ant was as bad as a lot of people thought, but he was definitely one of the weaker ones. I give him props for coming out of his comfort zone and giving it a shot. He didn't have to put himself out there. IMO, Bonnie was the worst. Sal was in the same boat as Ant where he was fairly weak, but he's not a comedian and I respect he gave it a shot.   I thought Vecchione, Ari, and Soder all legit killed it. Big Jay, Luis, and Mark Normand were great too."
TACSdiscussion,3docmi,glyde69,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:21:11 2015 UTC,"Nailed it. I think comparatively, especially going on after Normand Ant did the worst job out of every body, but I've seen people bomb, & Ant didn't bomb, as much as reddit & Twitter want that to be the case."

He was way funnier than Big Jay's wife who was the other non-comedian to roast.  He got a few laughs and there were several flubs.  About 20% got real laughs.

TACSdiscussion,3dkdea,sabbathrules,5,Fri Jul 17 14:53:38 2015 UTC,"I couldn't get through it. He was unraveling and it was painful to watch. His 30 minute video defending it made it worse.  I am a huge fan of Anthony's comedy throughout the years....but my God this one was bad.  I think it wouldn't be a big deal if he would stop defending it.  ""See guys! people laughed here...and here...""  We know a few laughs were had - but overall, it was a bad set. It happens. Own it."
TACSdiscussion,3dkdea,HackingYourMonitor,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:07:07 2015 UTC,As a fan I wanted Anthony to do a good set I even hoped he would do a fantastic set (like he was some kind of natural) I was even nervous for him doing this standup. But in the end it was an okay set for a beginner. I think he could improve  massively with a little (a lot!) more preparation and not writing jokes on the spot (preparation is everything). Loved the fact he did the roast at all though.
TACSdiscussion,3dkdea,Brombeee,2,Fri Jul 17 15:16:51 2015 UTC,"I agree.  His timing was not on and had it been it would have been much better.  However he did get some laughs, just not a lot.  It could have been WAAAY worse.    It wasn't good but I didn't find it cringworthy like OP.  I thought Big Jay's wife's was the worst of the night and compared to her Ant was hilarious."

Of course he was going to bomb, he's the celebrity guest.  EDIT:  Just watched it.  He started off bad, then he had a few good ones, then he jumped off the edge again.  It wasn't that bad, it was just the 40 year old references and stumbling over all his jokes.  And Harris Stanton did worse.  That could have been Ant's fault for poisoning the well right before it though."

He was clearly nervous at first but found his radio cadence after a few lines- but his material was basically his standard stuff.  He didn't bomb, he didn't kill- he was just the same guy we've listened to for 1000's of hours of radio. Not sure what anyone was expecting.    What he didn't do was impressions- and he's always been a far better impressionist than a setup/punchline comic"
TACSdiscussion,3dkdea,jakdak,3,Fri Jul 17 11:13:28 2015 UTC,I expected him to do OK or possibly even do terrible.  He did bad but is trying to tell people that he did good.  That is where he is losing everybody.  If he bombed and then trashed himself for bombing it would be funny.  He bombed but since Keith and his girlfriend told him he did great he can't come to terms with the fact that he actually stunk.  It's hard to watch.

TACSdiscussion,3djklh,Amiigo7,0,Fri Jul 17 05:26:41 2015 UTC,"Let's break it down.  He was definitely in the bottom three performers of the night and some of his jokes weren't good.  He did have a few decent lines.    I think we can all say that bombing is getting no laughs from the audience.  I don't remember hearing laughs but it was hard to hear them off and on the whole night.  So to fairly judge if he bombed we can only use the reaction of the people on stage as a gauge.  If I remember correctly he was getting NOTHING from Bonnie, Sal or anybody else on the front row.  Louis and Jay seemed to laugh at his stuff, but they do have a reason to be biased.    My judgement?  In comparison to the experienced comedians he didn't do well at all, but I think he needs to be graded on a curve since he is not a stand up and he wrote his own material.  He seemed super nervous and that didn't help either.  There is not enough evidence to say he bombed until I hear clear audio of crown noise (or lack there of).  I give him a C+ all things considered."

That's the really pathetic part about all of this... that's probably why we don't hear from her anymore on his show.  Because at the basic level he's no different... and at the same time it is more pathetic because unlike Di he's got a brain and true resources to get help.

TACSdiscussion,3dj4ca,OldGearJammer,0,Thu Jul 16 22:31:17 2015 UTC,"Lol, I really don't think I could tie a noose.   As far as I know, BCS is in a spot where the writers and big actors are doing some read alongs for the early scripts. They are shooting some external shots, hiring locals for extras, and things of that nature. I truly don't believe the veterinarian who had 2.5 minutes of screen time the entire season is actively shooting at the moment, and I think he completely pussied out of the roast.   I'm not a DeRosa hater either. I thought he did well in his BCS role, and I personally liked him on O&A every time he was on. Him, Ant, Patrice, Burr....I thought he fit in well with those guys, and as some of the old school great comics were phasing out(burr and CK from success; Patrice by dying), I thought DeRosa and guys like Soder were the best of the new crop of comedians to star on O&A once or twice a month.   But I don't believe DeRosa bailed for BCS, but because he's a pussy and didn't want to take a beating. Sadly, if he went after Ant last night, he really could have shredded him to bits, and gained back some of the street cred he's lost the last year. Also, there's a small chance him and Ant could have taken that first step to maybe not being friends like they used to be, but the first step to them hashing out some stuff and maybe seeing DeRosa on TACS in the future or even LoS at the compound with Ant guesting or just chilling on the couch."

He obviously exaggerates his points incredibly for comedic effect and i'm pretty sure he enjoys annoying people like a troll, but yeah, theres some stuff he seems to really believes that i just can't get on board with at all. Like the christian god specifically, just because he saw his child's heartbeat via sonar which is fucking retarded. Or that all women should have children and if they don't they've somehow ruined their own lives."

TACSdiscussion,3di21a,SergeantFartbox,7,Thu Jul 16 19:48:29 2015 UTC,It's politically biased
TACSdiscussion,3di21a,Phantas_Magorical,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:10:16 2015 UTC,"I believe the Civil War's leaders fought it over slavery, but that the everyday soldiers may not have necessarily been motivated by slavery. They fought for a wide range of reasons including pride, duty, and a steady wage. And I'm sure many had various views on slavery.   And it's also the case that Lincoln and the North were still racist. Lincoln's goal was to preserve the union and he would have done that by any means necessary."
TACSdiscussion,3di21a,Spokker,0,Thu Jul 16 18:50:40 2015 UTC,"But individual soldier's motivations isn't the cause of a war, the cause comes from the leaders who started it. Slavery was an institution that was detrimental to the North's economy, but necessary for the South's economy to survive. Saying that the Civil War was not about slavery is a gross oversimplification."
TACSdiscussion,3di21a,liberterrorism,2,Thu Jul 16 20:30:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, slavery was necessary for the South's economy to survive, but was it detrimental to the North? The North was industrializing in the absence of slavery.  And it's also the case that it wasn't all sunshine and roses for blacks in the North."
TACSdiscussion,3di21a,Spokker,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:36:41 2015 UTC,"Slavery in the South wasn't detrimental to the North's economy per se, but slavery in general was incompatible with industrialization. So two very different economies developed which caused a lot of tension every time there was a new state being founded."

I do however think less of him for not being able to admit that it was a terrible terrible bomb.  Seems like he's had too much ballwashing lately."

The first couple about Dan Soder got laughs from every one, and the joke about Ari having a little ""Joe Rogan"" on his chin for example.  I think he was the only person up there that did get absolutely zero reaction to some of his jokes though.   The line about Dan Soder being ""an enigma between O&J...because they can't communicate...get it?"" didn't even get a fake laugh from the skanks."

TACSdiscussion,3dgf1g,damselnoir,3,Thu Jul 16 08:00:11 2015 UTC,"You are most likely correct about the prep.

TACSdiscussion,3dgf1g,pinballmars,21,Thu Jul 16 16:48:26 2015 UTC,"Seeing Anthony humbled like that actually made me like him more (and I'm already a big fan). If you've ever done (or gone to) comedy open mics, Anthony made all of the first-timer mistakes (talking too fast, trampling over his own jokes, losing confidence in mid-sentence, etc.) He stunk the place up good, but so has everyone who's ever done comedy at some point or another. That's what comedy is: falling on your face a lot on the way to getting good. Bottom line: A guy who's great on the radio isn't necessarily going to be instantly great delivering a ten-minute monologue on stage (and vice versa). Furthermore, there are great comedians who aren't very good at roasts. It's a unique skill of its own, like being a good impressionist or writing good one-liners."
TACSdiscussion,3dgf1g,SIGNEDUPFORTHIS123,21,Thu Jul 16 04:24:15 2015 UTC,"He's talked for years about how he did't think he could do stand up.  He was clearly panicking when he got up to the mic with the way he was practically laying on and clutching the podium.    He bombed and about half his jokes sucked but some were good and got nothing because he had already lost the crowd.    I give him respect for, clearly, writing his own jokes and not just reading some pre-written shit he paid somebody for."
TACSdiscussion,3dgf1g,SAHandre,5,Thu Jul 16 03:15:28 2015 UTC,I also thought some of his jokes were pretty good even though no one laughed. I hope this inspires him to step up the comedy element of his show and cut the political/race shit down.

Nobody was laughing because you fucked up the punch line... Anthony said (paraphrasing) ""big Jay Oakerson could be the next Amy Schumer.. all he needs to do is put on a blonde wig and lose some weight!""  He was supposed to say ""Big Jay Oakerson could be the next Amy Schumer.. all he needs to do is put on a blonde wig and GAIN some weight!""

Also, he dropped a lot of ""inside"" jokes that I don't think most fans of Big Jay might have known. I'm sure there's a good % of crossover O&A/LOS fans, but Ant did drop a bunch of things about himself and Opie that maybe not everyone listening got.   IMO, he should have strayed away from any race jokes. Ant has stood up over the years and said a lot things white people think, but can't say, and I agree with a lot of what he says and thinks and his politics too, but the last year, even I'm tired of the race stuff. I think if he shied away from racial jokes completely, he possibly could have won over the live crowd a little better. Especially as he knew coming in, he was gonna get pounded with racial jokes from start to finish.   Overall, I give him a C. Not terrible for his first time out there.

TACSdiscussion,3dk4tv,SIGNEDUPFORTHIS123,0,Fri Jul 17 00:19:00 2015 UTC,"Copied from my post on the other bomb thread... Let's break it down. He was definitely in the bottom three performers of the night and some of his jokes weren't good. He did have a few decent lines. I think we can all say that bombing is getting no laughs from the audience. I don't remember hearing laughs but it was hard to hear them off and on the whole night. So to fairly judge if he bombed we can only use the reaction of the people on stage as a gauge. If I remember correctly he was getting NOTHING from Bonnie, Sal or anybody else on the front row. Louis and Jay seemed to laugh at his stuff, but they do have a reason to be biased. My judgement? In comparison to the experienced comedians he didn't do well at all, but I think he needs to be graded on a curve since he is not a stand up and he wrote his own material. He seemed super nervous and that didn't help either. There is not enough evidence to say he bombed until I hear clear audio of crown noise (or lack there of). I give him a C+ all things considered."
TACSdiscussion,3dk4tv,Carlos-Danger-,-3,Thu Jul 16 22:58:19 2015 UTC,Sal and Bonnie were laughing throughout ants set. Ant definitely got a positive reaction.

The way I saw Ant get destroyed, I thought he really really lost his shit and was AWFUL.   IMO, that wasn't the case. He started a little slow and was nervous as fuck(understandable). Then he kind of picked it up a bit, but the crowd wasn't giving him much, and then he kind of fizzled out.   One of the weaker roasters? Yes. I think only Bonnie was worse. But he gave it his all, was a great sport through it all, and had some decent energy. He had a handful of bombs, but also snuck in some good lines/jokes even if his delivery wasn't perfect(nerves and inexperience).   He went smack in the middle of a lineup of some great experienced comics and for his first time....it wasn't that bad. I don't mean to sound like a dick sucker, but I give him props. He's not a ""comedian"" and he didn't have to do it, but he gave it a shot and I respect that.   Also, people keep saying he was unprepared....I don't get that either. He might not have been organized like Vecchione was(that dude brought his A game plus some), but again he's a comedian and that's his job. If it was easy to stand up in front of a dozen of some of the best comedians out there and kill it, everyone would be a stand up.   TL;DR version. Ant wasn't great, but for his first time putting together a set of jokes and performing in front of a live crowd, he wasn't that bad. IMO."
TACSdiscussion,3dk4tv,wp9215,3,Thu Jul 16 23:42:14 2015 UTC,"It wasn't as bad as people are making it out, but he semi bombed. I thought around half of the jokes or more fell flat. Maybe the expectations were too high because of how naturally funny Ant is."
TACSdiscussion,3dk4tv,NotRye,-1,Fri Jul 17 00:11:18 2015 UTC,"And even if he did bomb.  So what?  Ant's one of the funniest people I ever heard, I think one bad set can be forgiven."
TACSdiscussion,3dk4tv,SAHandre,8,Thu Jul 16 22:40:08 2015 UTC,"Nothing. He did bomb sir, but you are right he is a funny man and it can be forgiven. He does, however, have to own up to it, learn from it and step it up a lil. Maybe the NYC studio will help bring him back to reality a bit. It'll just make the show better"
TACSdiscussion,3dk4tv,NotRye,5,Thu Jul 16 23:37:39 2015 UTC,"You're right.  If he bombed, just acknowledge it and move on.  Denying it is the worst thing.  Anyway, I just started watching the roast.  I hope the douche chills aren't too bad."
TACSdiscussion,3dk4tv,SAHandre,2,Thu Jul 16 23:49:08 2015 UTC,it's really in comparison to the sheer volume of the laughs for EVERY other person that it's clear ant ate his balls.

TACSdiscussion,3dk4tv,Touch_Of_Red,0,Fri Jul 17 01:28:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was fine.  He obviously had the worst set out of everyone but that doesn't mean it was horrible, it just seemed worse by comparison since it wasn't as funny or polished as the professional stand ups."
TACSdiscussion,3dk4tv,megszent,0,Thu Jul 16 23:44:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know, maybe he got enough laughs for it not to be considered bombing. I cringed a lot and by the end I was sweaty. If not a bombing certainly a car wreck. It's not a big fuckin deal though."
TACSdiscussion,3dk4tv,OldGearJammer,-7,Fri Jul 17 01:45:19 2015 UTC,"Half of the fucken retards on this and the O&A sub just repeat Jim Norton insults and think they're being funny and original. I doubt many could write a 10 minute set better than Ant's last night. I'd still argue it was the weakest set of the night. But the herd mentality of both of these subs is fucken disgusting. Ant had some good lines, some average and really ugly ones. His delivery didn't help either, especially near the end when he started rushing through. But to say he bombed is bullshit. Compared to almost everyone else last night maybe, but it was still more entertaining than most  of the Comedy Central Roasters I've seen."

TACSdiscussion,3dk4tv,OldGearJammer,0,Fri Jul 17 02:21:38 2015 UTC,"It was bad, especially with the expectations and compared to the other comics.

TACSdiscussion,3dk4tv,TheSean85,0,Fri Jul 17 10:11:42 2015 UTC,Having looked on here before watching... It wasn't as bad as I thought. Not to say it wasn't pretty shit. I wouldn't have done any better.

TACSdiscussion,3dk4tv,jsmill1,-1,Fri Jul 17 02:04:38 2015 UTC,"I usually hate this kind of opinion, but I think you have to legitimately be a racist person to have enjoyed about 50% of what he said.  The most offensive being when he said some joke whose basic premise was ""black people don't think,"" and he didn't even deliver it like a joke.  I'm not ""offended"" by it, but it's just a shitty thing to say.    Then a joke where basically all he said was that because Mike Vecchione's grandma was Italian, she must have been a racist (and in a way where he thought it was endearing, and he was reminiscing).  Also managed to find some way to shoehorn hoses in the '50s, and some obscure reference to a black thing that almost no one but hardcore fans of his would've ever understood in the first place.  Was any of it funny?  I laughed when he made the joke about Soder taking his seat while he was up performing.  That was legitimately clever.  Other than that, I can't remember laughing one time.  The Opie line about Vos was pandering and it's been said to death on Reddit, which we know he looks at."

TACSdiscussion,3dlbcz,McGobs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:09:53 2015 UTC,"I was trying to be on Ant's side. From what he showed of his performance on the show, it wasn't that bad. I decided to pop on the roast to get a feel for it myself. Metzger fucking destroyed. Mike Vecchione was great--not a killer but handled himself perfectly up there. Dave set high expectations by starting off great with ""You open with Metzger and Vecchione?"" and then immediately tanked--I couldn't watch the rest because you could tell he was so green. I had to skip through Carla as well, being unable to put up with the cringe. Then Ant comes up and I have to watch it. Starts off great, but then starts being unable to deal with the lack of laughs at some of his jokes. He felt the need to explain them after waiting for the laughter that never came. Handled himself horribly with the jokes that didn't work. His uncomfortability made the crowd uncomfortable. People were begging for decent jokes, giving polite laughs where some manner of cleverness shone through, and then he starts throwing out jokes that would have been edgy in the 70s. It was bad.    I wanted to be on Ant's side, and I was from what he showed me on TACS and through that same portion of the roast. But his jokes were undeniably bad, his manner was undeniably cringey, and Luis cut the tension by acknowledging the elephant in the room after Ant just walked off to confused applause.    He may not have bombed in the way that a horrible comedian does to a crowd that's giving him nothing back, but it was definitely bad. Ant was right. He needed to be meaner. He's not 100% oblivious. He knows it wasn't the worst. But I think he's basing his overall performance off of the initial reaction of the crowd and not where he eventually led it."

TACSdiscussion,3dfnm0,Ebhagz,7,Thu Jul 16 00:34:20 2015 UTC,"Dave is very talented and unfiltered, which is both perfect and problematic, especially once politics are discussed. The promotion of libertarian ideas will dominate the rest of the broadcast at that point. Gomez leads Dave very well, while Cumia is more open to whatever direction the discussion takes.   It was an interesting back-and-forth nonetheless, but the danger of becoming a monotone promotion for liberalism is very big. I'd love to see Dave get the spot though, if he doesn't overkill it with that. He is very underrated indeed."
TACSdiscussion,3dfnm0,TossyMcSalad,3,Wed Jul 15 22:53:32 2015 UTC,I think he comes off that way only because he gets asked the same general questions.  If he was a co-host that could take on different political topics in that context I bet he would have some interesting things to contribute.
TACSdiscussion,3dfnm0,MeltdownMex,3,Thu Jul 16 03:42:37 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see at least one episode with just Ant and Dave.  Ant's more your regular republican who is libertarianish.  Dave uses the word minarchist so he's deep into libertarianism.  People sometimes say they want somebody on the opposite end of the political spectrum for a debate.  But the far left is complete idiots and the two sides don't even speak the same language.  Besides, libertarians understand leftists more than leftists understand themselves.  I think it would be more interesting to hear two guys that are in the same ballpark.  But Ant's a guy who felt it out through a wild and interesting life, while Dave has read up on what the most principled and consistent stance is."

TACSdiscussion,3dfnm0,UpInSmoke1,3,Wed Jul 15 23:35:33 2015 UTC,"For a long time Dave was my least favourite person on the podcast, but recently I've turned a corner and I think he's great.  I love Part of the Problem, even though I don't agree with everything he says he lays it out in such a compelling and reasonable way it's infuriating to me that he isn't more well known. I am concerned that I shall slowly turn Libertarian, which I'm pretty sure still carries the death penalty in England.  This carpet bombing at the Roast could be a turning point for Ant, a chance to get outside of his own head and start making some intelligent decisions instead of ones based in laziness. If you're going to do a political show fine, but make it interesting. The only person who can get away with sitting on their own and spouting their insane political beliefs is Gavin, and that's because he's a mad genius.  This is the best idea I've heard so far. Dave can and will challenge Ant, and he'll do it in a way that is succinct and comprehensible even for that Asbestos eaten guinea pederast. I think people will be surprised by how much they disagree on things.  GET DAVE ON TACS ANT, SAVE THE NETWORK."

It was well worth the subscription price despite Ant doing his best impression of Little Boy."
TACSdiscussion,3diq20,Spokker,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:53:48 2015 UTC,The entire set didnt bomb. A couple of jokes at the beginning didnt do well but a bunch of them got pretty big laughs from the other people in the room.

I'd never be able to honestly say Ant had a good set but the threads here made it out to be a lot worse than I felt it actually was.  Repeating the same ""my pool was like an oilslick"" LoS joke he's used at least twice already was amateur. So was fucking up his punchline to the Schumer ""losing weight"" joke. But he IS an amateur, so he did as well as could be expected.   I really enjoyed Normand."

TACSdiscussion,3dhud3,kgt5003,5,Thu Jul 16 21:16:33 2015 UTC,He got some laughs from the other comics but the audience was completely against him. He probably shouldn't have come right out the gate with the race jokes.
TACSdiscussion,3dhud3,sabbathrules,7,Thu Jul 16 12:29:35 2015 UTC,It wasn't really the audience's fault.  The audience most likely doesn't know a lot about Ant and his jokes were almost entirely inside shit about O&A and DeRosa and his racism.  People were there for Big Jay and they had Ant go up there and start crackin jokes about the radio show he got fired from who a lot of the people in the audience may very well have never listened to.  The comics were laughing at how bad he was bombing.
TACSdiscussion,3dhud3,kgt5003,2,Thu Jul 16 14:08:38 2015 UTC,"You're making excuses, his jokes were just shit. ""There are more white people here than a black lives matter thing"" and his ""this looks like nasa in the 50s here"" (paraphrasing) are just bad. Stand up is a completely different vibe than just hanging out and the words and phrasing matter."
TACSdiscussion,3dhud3,little-pete-ferguson,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:24:01 2015 UTC,I think you may have misread what I said.  I'm not making excuses.  I'm saying he stunk.  The person I responded to said the audience was against him and I'm saying the audience should have been against him because he did unfunny jokes about the radio show he was fired from and racism.
TACSdiscussion,3dhud3,Jaaahhh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:36:23 2015 UTC,"A major point you made hear.  He just isn't well known enough to go ultra inside like Jimmy & Opie jokes and the firing etc  Lets face it, the hosts thought Sal Vulcano was the 'big get'"
TACSdiscussion,3dhud3,kgt5003,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:34:05 2015 UTC,This may sound silly but I'm pretty sure if you're at the compound you're at least aware of the o&a show.
TACSdiscussion,3dhud3,Jaaahhh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:18:41 2015 UTC,"The roast wasn't at the compound.  It was a bunch of LOS fans at the creek and cave.  They may be aware that the Opie and Anthony show existed but he is doing jokes about Dan Soder taking his seat on the show and Opie finally letting Rich Vos leave the house and DeRosa stabbing him in the back.  This is all shit that people who don't regularly listen to Opie and Jimmy have no clue why it's funny and people who haven't subscribed to Ant's show specifically who are in the crowd aren't going to laugh about the DeRosa thing because they don't follow Ant's twitter drama.  The fans that are in the audience follow Big Jay and LOS and LOS haven't been a part of TACS for long and all of the shit that Ant was joking about happened well before LOS got on the TACS network so he pretty much alienated most of the live audience by telling jokes that mean nothing to them.  Not to mention the jokes were weak anyways:  ""If anybody out there is eating and needs a knife you can pull the knife outta my back that DeRosa stuck there!""  Wakka Wakka!"

So now they've blocked up all the windows they can more easily green screen a New York city skyline behind Gavin?  Green screen stinks. It makes people feel ill. Those that have to sit in a harsh and uncomfortably overlit green box, and those that have to sit at home and watch the noisy fuzzy-edged video output. Real studio, real set, that's how it works. Enough with this amateur-night George Lucas prequel shite."
TACSdiscussion,3dfs43,RupertRooksby,6,Wed Jul 15 23:11:49 2015 UTC,"Trust me, I agree. I'd much prefer a Joe Rogan esque setup than a green screen. It's easy enough to throw some fun stuff up in the background, have a radio desk, nice lighting and you're set.   It will seem as though that its no different than the compound setup, which sort of makes moving to the city meh, but I guess it will bring in better guests and all that jazz."
TACSdiscussion,3dfs43,GumbleDog,2,Wed Jul 15 23:22:59 2015 UTC,To my knowledge the green screen won't be a full time thing. Rogan's setup is cool for a podcast not a show. Not enough light and cameras too close. Ant described it yesterday as a multiple camera setup where him and the guests are looking at each other so that's an improvement imo.

I understand it if a conservative says ""The Mexicans come here and freeload, so we need to get rid of welfare before we let them in.  But if they can't freeload I have no problem.""  I totally believe that Mexican immigrants commit a lot of crimes.  But we just accept that some crimes will happen, and the police will do their best to catch the criminals.  In Gavin's words, that lady that got killed in San Francisco is one data point.  We give these Mexicans their chance, but lock'em up if they blow it.  Those that don't cause trouble, welcome to America, learn to speak American.  But it's pretty evident that ""fairly enforcing the law"" is considered ""racist"" now, so I can see how it's logical to not expect our justice system to keep us safe, and prefer to not let anybody in.  But I'm unconvinced, and I think it's distracting people from better, more libertarian issues, and also I think Trump is embarrassing conservatives."

TACSdiscussion,3dgqfi,Ebhagz,3,Thu Jul 16 03:44:18 2015 UTC,How you roast..  http://youtu.be/5F9M3L04ROM
TACSdiscussion,3dgqfi,1Hominid,9,Thu Jul 16 05:55:46 2015 UTC,He should have just did his Dice impression.
TACSdiscussion,3dgqfi,E-rockComment,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:46:24 2015 UTC,Ant actually wallowed in the tail spin but it would have been awesome if he had ironically hacked it up and gone into a ronald reagan impression.
TACSdiscussion,3dgqfi,erockarmy,2,Thu Jul 16 17:24:14 2015 UTC,Ask questions and wait for a response?  So the guy with the microphone is going to ask questions of people who don't have a microphone so nobody can hear the response and then hopefully they say something that you can make a joke about?  You think that would have been a successful way to do a roast?  That might be the only possible way Ant could have done worse than he did.
TACSdiscussion,3dgqfi,kgt5003,2,Thu Jul 16 14:25:09 2015 UTC,"Ant fucked up by NOT having prepared material. It all seemed thrown together at the last minute.   Sure, he probably would have killed if he had a microphone and could respond to every comment made about him off the cuff, but this wasn't his show. It wasn't about just riffing."

TACSdiscussion,3dgqfi,ShaneMichaelOfficial,0,Thu Jul 16 06:28:11 2015 UTC,I felt he kept firing shots at Rich wayy too often for someone that isn't actually on the roast. 1 maybe 2 jokes I get but don't use Vos as a safety blanket. Jokes at himself would have been a better route imo

TACSdiscussion,3d5vvk,Thurdeye,5,Mon Jul 13 22:23:52 2015 UTC,So according to Ant a morning show is very likely. Sounds like Ant thinks TACS will be able to grow more with a morning show.
TACSdiscussion,3d5vvk,Brombeee,5,Mon Jul 13 20:38:02 2015 UTC,It's just a matter of good guests.  In NYC in the morning he can catch a buncha people on media tours and have a comedian as second mic every day.  Even Bill burr can only talk to himself for a couple hours a week.
TACSdiscussion,3d5vvk,racemic_mixture,4,Mon Jul 13 21:01:35 2015 UTC,"If he was smart and not lazy, he'd do a morning show and take OnJ head on.  A morning show in NYC with a good rotating 2nd mic will blow away the Sherrod/Stangel Brothers and Friends show."

Jimmy likes the mornings, so I'd rather have Ant compete with them for the next year and build up an audience then have Jimmy come aboard as a 2nd mic, rather than have Jimmy on twice per month."

Im sure he'd do better in the morning, but do you honestly think he'd make a dent in Sirius XM which has millions of advertising dollars backing it up and a name brand?  Not to mention Ant's show is much more accessible/can be listened to at any time, it's just the push of a button on an iphone app, you know?"
TACSdiscussion,3d5vvk,Weirdfellas,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:17:32 2015 UTC,"He would make a dent in OnJ listeners, which is all that matters.  Plus, a 4:00 show sucks.  I'm at work at 4 and so are most people.  He has to compete with Game of Thrones in order to get me to go home and fire up the app or his website and watch/listen and that isn't happening.    A new show during the most coveted time slot in radio is what he should be doing."
TACSdiscussion,3d5vvk,kevin121312,2,Mon Jul 13 21:23:19 2015 UTC,He mentioned doing a replay later in the day. It sounds like he wants to do a morning show partly so that they can fill the channel with content throughout the day.

I don't think it's just O&A people here anymore it's actual racists from niggermania and the like so Ant is giving the audience what they want & that being said may be defficult to go back to just entertaining the O&A fans as the KKK members will get bored

But the enforcement did come to play til the War On Drugs. Would you disagree that the majority of what a police officer does is drug related? Why does it have to be that way? It absolutely wasn't that way prior to the Nixon administration that got the ball rolling"

MexicaNS there WISHED~!!! they were black in the 1960s. Wetbacks today would consider blacks in the 1960's as white priviledge.

As to whether I hate Anthony, I'd say I don't. I think he can be one of the funniest people on the planet, but it seems like he just doesn't want to be that guy anymore. It's kinda sad, really."
TACSdiscussion,3ctq8o,IAmVictoriaAMA,-4,Fri Jul 10 20:37:51 2015 UTC,"""It's kinda sad, really.""  You're like those boring local radio show hosts who would condescendingly say they felt bad for Howard for being ""forced underground"" to satellite radio. While Howard was actually having a blast at satellite and was finally getting away with all the shit he always wanted to get away with."
TACSdiscussion,3ctq8o,Slippery_Slope_Guy,6,Sat Jul 11 02:21:08 2015 UTC,"How would you describe it? Does Anthony seem like he's having a blast drunkenly bashing blacks and a big titted ex partner who wants nothing to do with him while he's on vacation in Hawaii?   Actually now that I think about it, I'd describe it as sad and embarrassing.   Edit: Also, Anthony's broadcasting from his basement, whereas Stern was on satellite radio. Surely you can't think the two are comparable. And that doesn't even take into account the incredible paycheck hoo-hoo got."
TACSdiscussion,3ctq8o,IAmVictoriaAMA,0,Sat Jul 11 03:07:41 2015 UTC,I really don't care what Anthony chooses to do on his vacation.
TACSdiscussion,3ctq8o,opieisdumb,-2,Sat Jul 11 04:08:33 2015 UTC,"Listening to him talk about how miserable and stressful it was to walk on Greggshells for all those years, yes, I'd say there is a good chance that he is genuinely happier now.  And my point about Howard was this: Howard always wanted to run a dirty show, so he was happy when he was finally able to do it. Ant always wanted to be able to express his political and ideological views without having to tiptoe around the PC police, so he's probably happy now that he can finally do it. At the very least, he's relieved, and the stress he's feeling right now in Hawaii is probably nothing compared to the stress he felt on OnA.  If you assume Ant is sad merely because he has a smaller audience and a smaller paycheck, you're projecting your priorities onto him. Just like how those terrestrial radio hosts were projecting their priorities onto Howard when saying they felt sorry for him. Howard didn't give a shit about starting off at Sirius with a smaller audience- he valued the freedom to be dirty more."

I never argued that. But I object to the guy saying that Ant's situation is ""sad."" If you're pissed off by the things he says or you don't like what the show has become, just say that. You don't have to resort to this ""How sad, I feel sorry for him"" bullshit. I hate that shit. It's NEVER sincere."

If by ""it's sad,"" you mean that Ant's situation makes YOU sad, I would tell you to get over it. A grown man, whom you don't even know, living his life the way he wants to live it should not make you sad."

He does a shit show put of his basement cuz he got fired. Wa part of that did he want?  All the dude has done is been a bitch since they broke up. Treated their brand with no respect. He takes the most childish shots at opie, he's so clearly jelous opie is making millions and he's making thousands.

When they were gathering info on the most toxic subreddits I was the only one on the thread who correctly called it for what it was, an obvious attempt to root out, astroturf or ban.  It's amusing to watch them in action but when I see someone who was posting a year or more ago fall into the trap I begin to feel sad. It's fixable so long as the moderators aren't compromised and so far they aren't."

He's a talented guy but he cannot race debate for his life, and this was clear in the one episode where he invites an opposing opinion and he loses. It's a topic he should avoid all together unless he can pull off something like Joe Rogan and get someone with some experience who won't yes man him.   Anthony was wrong about Freddie Gray, he even said during the show he had guessed all of the outcomes right in the past cases 100%.

TACSdiscussion,3cmklw,Travixus,3,Thu Jul 9 02:21:47 2015 UTC,I have been a few times. It is horrendously hot and sweaty.
TACSdiscussion,3cmklw,jackwolfe4000,8,Thu Jul 9 02:27:26 2015 UTC,"DAMMIT, was hoping to see up that chick's skirt that was sitting behind Dave to the right when the feed started. And now fucking people sit down in the line of sight from the camera."
TACSdiscussion,3cmklw,AutisticInTech,6,Thu Jul 9 02:09:06 2015 UTC,She either has resting bitch face or is ridiculously uncomfortable.
TACSdiscussion,3cmklw,PacinosWig,2,Thu Jul 9 04:00:57 2015 UTC,"Seeing it now, but its just a black hole of disappointment."
TACSdiscussion,3cmklw,srb9586,3,Thu Jul 9 06:26:35 2015 UTC,It usually is.

TACSdiscussion,3cmklw,iris201,3,Thu Jul 9 03:20:21 2015 UTC,Is that girl doing coke in the back?
TACSdiscussion,3cmklw,paradin,3,Thu Jul 9 02:07:08 2015 UTC,Looks like it's a tattoo kit.
TACSdiscussion,3cmklw,ohpipedown,3,Thu Jul 9 02:57:04 2015 UTC,I want Luis to record a new intro using his fat girl voice.

TACSdiscussion,3cmklw,Koolaider,3,Thu Jul 9 03:18:02 2015 UTC,TACS and LoS in one day for Bobo. What a maven.
TACSdiscussion,3cmklw,Mavsfan365,2,Thu Jul 9 02:13:35 2015 UTC,"That girl with the purple hair, in the audience, was sexy as hell."
TACSdiscussion,3cmklw,RPCulture,0,Thu Jul 9 11:54:01 2015 UTC,Curious what drugs Rebecca is on tonight.  Her eye issues suggest ecstasy.
TACSdiscussion,3cmklw,68rouge,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:54:14 2015 UTC,who is the big titted girl in the black shirt?
TACSdiscussion,3cmklw,SlobKelly,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:52:52 2015 UTC,This was a hilarious episode
TACSdiscussion,3cmklw,balonish,-1,Sat Jul 11 13:01:02 2015 UTC,hope they get bobo talkin
TACSdiscussion,3cmklw,racemic_mixture,7,Thu Jul 9 02:15:09 2015 UTC,"Why would you hope for that?  ""hey lets get a retard in amongst these comedic geniuses"""
TACSdiscussion,3cmklw,balonish,5,Thu Jul 9 02:34:58 2015 UTC,idk man i've only seen funny come from it
TACSdiscussion,3cmklw,prtyflkjdie,0,Thu Jul 9 02:36:20 2015 UTC,i just want him showing his mutalated dick to jay for the reaction
TACSdiscussion,3cmklw,Travixus,3,Thu Jul 9 03:32:46 2015 UTC,"Jay has seen it already. He was sitting next to Patrice during the ""Up/Down Game"" bit on O&A."
TACSdiscussion,3cmklw,michaeIcolestie,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:59:02 2015 UTC,If that ever happened they better have a bucket next to jay
TACSdiscussion,3cmklw,erockarmy,0,Thu Jul 9 19:07:58 2015 UTC,"or coughing, and then he pukes on the floor and the skanks beat the shit out of him..blugghh..i'b sorry!"
TACSdiscussion,3cmklw,AutisticInTech,0,Thu Jul 9 03:07:50 2015 UTC,"Of course the chick smashed the guy in the Salon write up. Women have utter contempt for overly agreeable men. Women when they see what they perceive as weakness in masculinity, despise it. Its why they delight in having betas about in the friend zone to dick around."
TACSdiscussion,3cokjf,FistSmasher,13,Thu Jul 9 14:53:36 2015 UTC,If you judged Big Jay Oakerson for his appearance on O&A with Patrice you'd be saying the same thing about Jay.  People like Bobby dominate shows with Ant just because they have years of chemistry.
TACSdiscussion,3cokjf,JoblessZombie,7,Thu Jul 9 15:16:34 2015 UTC,People like Bobby dominate shows bc they're fat blowhards who won't let other people get a word in edgewise. Source: Am a fat blowhard.
TACSdiscussion,3cokjf,erockarmy,4,Thu Jul 9 16:48:33 2015 UTC,He seemed uncomfortable and holding way back. He only talked when the safe subject of being black came up. I'm not trashing him it was just very strange.
TACSdiscussion,3cokjf,megszent,10,Thu Jul 9 16:17:19 2015 UTC,"I think he's good, but I think he just got overpowered by Bobby on that episode, because Bobby and Ant have a long relationship and hadn't talked in a while."
TACSdiscussion,3cokjf,wp9215,2,Thu Jul 9 15:41:19 2015 UTC,He holds his beer weird. Bottles and cans both
TACSdiscussion,3cokjf,JerkStoreJ,2,Thu Jul 9 23:06:11 2015 UTC,Because he's got a tree on his house
TACSdiscussion,3cokjf,anthropopopometry,3,Fri Jul 10 10:09:49 2015 UTC,"I think it goes back to Ant's appearance on YKDW with Mike. If i remember correctly they were talking about their favourite movies or something. Ant goes ""I love American History X the first half."" Then it's Mike turn and he goes ""I love American History X the secon half."" Room explodes....  And ever since then some people thought he was funny but I would say that was the only time I ever laughed at anything he ever said. Black from the compound sucks balls and the people who like him thought he was the 2nd coming of Patrice or something. Idiots that listens to one joke and declares someone the ""the best EVA!"". Retards."
TACSdiscussion,3cokjf,Ninjawisdom,7,Thu Jul 9 15:10:35 2015 UTC,"That was a great episode of YKWD. Then Mike Brown's First Appearance on TACS was great. I think he's good every time he's on. But agree Bob overpowered him, which is fine. It's better than having just Mike and him bombing.   I like him. I didn't think Brandon was as bad as everyone says,.. but someone said he has a problem with Ant? Never heard the story behind that."
TACSdiscussion,3cokjf,XytheOwnsJoo,2,Thu Jul 9 16:06:12 2015 UTC,I think Brandon got pissed about Keith playing chimp sounds to riot footage.
TACSdiscussion,3cokjf,Crigger540,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:10:05 2015 UTC,This is comedy. You don't get to have hurt feelings about a joke.  If that were the case then OnA would have never been funny because almost their entire shtick was hurting people's feelings and not giving a fuck.
TACSdiscussion,3cokjf,TheMarlBroMan,0,Thu Jul 9 20:08:07 2015 UTC,"I think mike is funny, his friend I do not like."
TACSdiscussion,3cokjf,Jewykikeburger,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:15:02 2015 UTC,I think Mike smoked too much weed the last time he was on. That's not too professional in my opinion.
TACSdiscussion,3cokjf,Brombeee,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:44:22 2015 UTC,Agreed. He should follow in the LoS guys' footsteps. Now that is professionalism.
TACSdiscussion,3cokjf,Brombeee,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:49:22 2015 UTC,"Don't care whether he smoked or not, but if you know you can't handle drugs don't do them."
TACSdiscussion,3cokjf,SmoothCriminalAaron,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:07:13 2015 UTC,"Because if a black person is friends with Ant it means he's not a racist and me too!! :)  just kidding. Yeah that episode he was not that needed, but it's not like he is dragging the show down."
TACSdiscussion,3cokjf,NastyPiggy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:39:00 2015 UTC,He wasn't great with Bobby and Anthony but everyone has a bad appearance here and there.  At least he didn't try to step all over anyone's lines or become that annoying person who needed some attention.
TACSdiscussion,3cokjf,Spokker,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:22:38 2015 UTC,I thought he did a good job when he did his show a while back. It seemed like he was holding back a lot during the Bobby episode.  I think he needs more confidence but I would like to see him come on more often and let it rip.
TACSdiscussion,3cokjf,wrexecute,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:19:38 2015 UTC,"I like Mike, the dude doesn't seem to take shit personally. I was sure they (Mike and Brandon) were done with Ant after the monkey noises thing. His last appearance felt comfortable, even if he didn't speak much. Can't knock the dude for kicking back and letting the funny happen around him. Whatever, it's not the Mike Brown show anyway, who cares!?"
TACSdiscussion,3cokjf,little-pete-ferguson,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:45:59 2015 UTC,"Mike is at open mic level and he's at the table with the big boys  He's got potential and has good chops, very important in the business!"
TACSdiscussion,3cokjf,twerpturd,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:40:14 2015 UTC,"He doesn't add so much, but he doesn't bother me.  But also he's a comic that Ant feels comfortable around so he brings out the best in Ant.  That's pretty great."
TACSdiscussion,3cokjf,Lilcumia,-4,Fri Jul 10 07:03:36 2015 UTC,Because TACSdiscussion is fanboys not fans.
TACSdiscussion,3cokjf,Cockopotamas,0,Thu Jul 9 16:09:15 2015 UTC,"Mike brown is the shit. But no doubt he wasn't being himself. Don't judge him by that apperence. I would love a ""black from the compound"" show once ant is in NY."
TACSdiscussion,3cokjf,CCRed95,-5,Fri Jul 10 01:48:05 2015 UTC,he does a lot of forced scream laughing. i find him annoying to be honest. love bobby though
TACSdiscussion,3cokjf,Rock_Ape,-1,Thu Jul 9 15:16:37 2015 UTC,I'm still listening to him and every time he does that ridiculous over the top laugh the humor is gone.
