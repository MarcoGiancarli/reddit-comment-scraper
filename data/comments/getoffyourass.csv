getoffyourass,3duat3,ThatOneCuteNerdyGirl,3,Sun Jul 19 15:25:04 2015 UTC,"I currently go to Planet Fitness, and its fine for what it is.  I pay $10/mo to use their cardio machines which are always new and in decent shape.  Weight machines are fine too, but once I start lifting I'll be looking for another gym.  The biggest complaints people make about it is the monthly pizza/bagels, but it's not like anyone forces you to eat it.  Again, lack of free weights, but if you just want to hop on a bike/elliptical/treadmill in a clean, cheap gym, its worth you're money."
getoffyourass,3duat3,Lotronex,2,Sun Jul 19 19:42:43 2015 UTC,"No one at any gym is judgemental. I think most of the horror stories you hear are blown terribly out of proportion. People at the gym look/check out everyone who walks in, that doesn't mean they're judging you. Most people I know will actually speak highly of folks that decide to come in and commit. Everyone there started as a novice, there is zero shame to it.   As to which gym you sign up for depends on your goals. Planet fitness is ok if you just want to get in the gym at a fair price. If you're looking to one day perfect your body it may not be for you as they don't have many free weights. Larger gyms like xsport or places like golds are the best. The cost reflects that but they'll fit whatever goal you may have, plus even during the busy times there are always free machines. I get easily discouraged when I have to wait or work in with people that's why I stick to the larger places. The small local places are great too. They'll have everything you need but if it gets busy.... if you'll be hitting the gym at off peak times I'd recommend a small local joint at least until you establish a routine. If cost isn't high on the priority list hit a large chain gym. If you just want to get in the gym and feel it out, then planet fitness might be for you."

getoffyourass,3duat3,AtomicCrayola,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:31:20 2015 UTC,Do they cost extra money? I'm on a pretty tight budget.
getoffyourass,3duat3,ChaChaGalore,2,Tue Jul 21 22:25:34 2015 UTC,"If I see someone heavy making an effort to work out I always think ""good on you!"" I even have urges to actually tell them something along the lines of ""good job! Keep it up"" and those I see regularly I want to offer to go walking with them or encourage them to come with me for some light running. Except I'm really shy so I don't think I could ever do that.  Everyone at my gym is always very respectful and friendly towards all and I think the appreciation for individuals making an effort to change their lifestyle is shared by all mature adults."

I don't want my girls to grow up with a weight problem like I did.  I'm working on losing the excess 100 pounds I'm carrying around, and always mention that I'm working on losing some weight and getting healthy.  They are both at perfect weights and I couldn't be happier.  My oldest likes sweets, but she can take one bite of something sweet and she's done with it.  The younger one refuses to even try candy lol.  I'm so happy they don't have my sweet tooth :)"

You have a great resource there, that not everyone has access to so readily.   I think people do notice, but feel trapped or quite frankly overloaded with sometimes misleading information. I think there are often brief attempts at change but bad habits are also hard to kick. People also resist change, or think it's the American way, countless of reasons really.  I posted a link earlier that I quickly realised was nonsense after the promising intro, cue delete. This is why I choose to post NHS advice, as I trust it.

We just had some heavy rains so the chemical balance needs to be adjusted, I just need to bug my husband to do it today when he gets home.  So far the pool hasn't been too helpful yet, because both my girls are just learning, and I can't get very far away from them while in the pool at the moment.  I'm getting them some better swim aids that will allow me to swim to the deep end and back a few times so that's a start.  I'm really looking forward to getting back in there :)  Since I've been overweight most of my life, I know how hard it is to get in shape.  But when you're born, you're already in shape.  So with that mindset I keep a close eye to make sure they stay in good shape and they don't make the same mistakes I did."
