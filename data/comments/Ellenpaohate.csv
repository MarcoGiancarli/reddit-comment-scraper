Ellenpaohate,3dcyre,Orioh,10,Wed Jul 15 08:16:23 2015 UTC,"The solution to this is easy.  Allow member and subreddit filtering.  Hide subreddits you dislike, and filter any comments from those subscribed to them.  This way reddit doesn't lose anything diversity wise, while making the experience pretty and safe for those that get uptight over whatever they chose to be uptight about.  I personally want an age filter.  Under 22?  Filter.  This way what's seen is what one prefers to see, without sacrificing the diversity of the user base.  I am not racist, but I personally am interested in what communities like that are like.  A lot of what I take from reddit IS being able to witness fringe communities to get a better understanding of what their hot topics and arguments are, and disprove them.    If you want a win win win solution implement this easy change, and the whole community will benefit in more ways than trying to keep hate away, while simultaneously supporting that purpose.  Do it.  The majority love unfiltered, and this is a site to learn what other corporate entities shouldn't allow.  So the community moves on.    People want to express ideas and argue, and the moment you start to police the conversations, the Internet will find an alternative.  The users provide the content, and you provide a message board for discussion.  It will not be hard to reproduce, and when the community leaves, reddit dies, just like digg.  Setup filtering.  It's the only, and realistically best way, that will have more benefits than the problem you're trying to solve - and solve this problem as a side effect.  Cheers."

This is in response to the post scolding the Internet for saying whatever the fuck they want.   Sickening to see some of the things redditors wrote about Ellen? Really? That hurt feelings bullshit has no place on the Internet, and for a place trying to market itself as the ""Front Page"" of the Internet, you better put some fucking big boy pants on. Especially if you want to start making decisions that affect such a large community.   Fuck Ellen, and good riddance. While I do not agree that there should have been death threats made against her, I assure you my disagreement is not based off of a freedom of speech or other Internet freedoms, but instead because this is the Internet and taking it serious enough to want to kill somebody is just as insane as the person getting their feelings hurt for reading it.  Now that there has been a change in leadership, how about you go back to your roots and be a free place to express yourself without pandering to the highest bidder to pad your own pockets. Otherwise you will continue to face the revolution of people that just want to go online and see some shit."

It's not an implicit hatred like I would have for a murderer, psychopath or a bully. No, it's a lot more nuanced than that. It's the same type of hatred that you get when someone cuts you in line at the supermarket. That type of anger that induces a little whence in the back of your neck and a shiver of anger echoing through the vestiges of your body. That anger stems from my feeling that she's the personification of all the ills of society. She represents the corporate greed corroding the foundations of the things I love, the person looking for a handout, the one who's always looking to blame others instead of their own ineptitude, the person quick to use lawyers and sue instead of having a personal conversation. She's an adulterer and a liar and she's abused the goodwill of our society for her own personal gain. In short, she's the type to cut her piece of the pie from the middle and still get mad when you eat the crust. And it's these very things about her that represents the moral decay I despise. I honestly can say this with a straight face. I despise her. I don't wish her any physical harm because I'm not that type of person, but I just wish she would disappear from this website and by proxy my life in general. She needs to be fired; since she's held the position of CEO bad things have happened here. Negative things. It's time Reddit shed her and move on. Go away Pao.  EDIT: Thanks for the gold (I guess?). At the end of the day Reddit is just a website, but for me and many others we've spent a lot of time here and have a lot invested in the culture. If things don't work out then I will eventually go to another website. Not a terribly big deal. But I guess metaphorically speaking, it would be the same thing if the CEO of NASCAR decided to enact rules that went against the culture of the fans. They'd be pissed right? And the only people who would be trivializing their emotions would be those that weren't big NASCAR fans to begin with. So I get that many people wouldn't understand. But to the dude who's been wearing the same Dale Earnhardt Jr T-shirt to the Daytona 500 for the last 15 years he's gonna be pissed and I guess in some ways that's me. I'm flawed, I shouldn't be this invested, but that's just me."

I have never seen this interview. I just watched this dumbfounded. I'm amazed people this ignorant can climb to positions of such power.   She is given fair and direct questions, KC kept giving her a chance to explain herself and she just keeps up with the ""I can't talk about it...""   That's about the most fair interview she is going to get.   The way she acts, facial expressions, tone of voice, I can only imagine how fucking insufferable she is in a office setting. Can you imagine her behind closed doors?"
Ellenpaohate,3c5kpn,drewcantdraw,2,Sun Jul 5 18:23:16 2015 UTC,I can only imagine how fucking insufferable she is in a office setting.    Which is probably the real reason she was fired. She looks like an entitled pain in the ass that is nearly impossible to work with.

There has to be loads of Redditors in 'Frisco, her face is very well known and the building she lives in is quite easy to find, it's on her Wiki page. She has to bump into Redditors all the time.

An adult would hopefully be able to come up with a wider array of insults.  You could insult the deviant nature of the threads and people who look at them.  You could refer to them as idealists who don't understand commerce.  You could say that they're hypocrites for staying on Reddit as it turns into Facebook part 2.  Instead all you have is comparing people to teenagers.  Do you think about teenagers a lot?  I hear they have support groups for that.

Searching ""ellenpaohat"" doesn't break the app, but simply adding the ""e"" to the end causes everything to break.""  I tested it on two different phones; both times, it crashed after a few seconds on the sub.  I don't know if I'm just being paranoid, but it seems to be a thing. I doubt that you're in cahoots with the admins; is it possible that they've set a code to crash the app?  permalinkfull comments   [–]from talklittle sent 1 day ago  Thanks for the note.

Ellenpaohate,39qqbb,Henry_Burris,-90,Sun Jun 14 01:28:47 2015 UTC,Allowing freedom of speech means allowing freedom to offend and to disagree.
Ellenpaohate,39qqbb,rdrptr,31,Sun Jun 14 13:11:47 2015 UTC,So why did FPH ban everyone with a different opinion if they all care so much about free speech?  (rhetorical question)
Ellenpaohate,39qqbb,Shatter_,15,Sun Jun 14 01:52:22 2015 UTC,A downvote is speech.

Ellenpaohate,39qqbb,squidperior,-1,Sun Jun 14 03:21:40 2015 UTC,"It's bigger than FPH, or any of those other subs. It's about a gradual degradation and pollution of what reddit was meant to be."

Ellenpaohate,39qqbb,OrsonSwells,-2,Sun Jun 14 03:26:17 2015 UTC,"rules we want are obvious, no corporate garbage, they only lie.  rules we don't want, censorship that covers up what bullshit corporations are and government fuckery.  bernie sanders used to be on the front page, oops not what corp wants, gone.... fuck that  top it off all this went down while trying to fast track ttp, fuck them, lying twats, wanna be superior losers that have made themselves less than human, they are nothing now but hollow shells..."

I sincerely hope that this website does not have your interests in mind: Your rights to bully and harass under the guise of free speech are not some ideal to hold.

Ellenpaohate,39qqbb,TheNinnyMouse,-5,Sun Jun 14 03:30:02 2015 UTC,"It's not about FPH, it's bigger than that. It's about a gradual degradation of the founding principles of this community. Who decides who's shadow-banned? The admins, the mods?  We're products. Reddit makes money by selling access to this community to advertisers. But unlike your typical commodity, we have a say. Advertisers aren't quite sure what to think about reddit. There's weirdness, a lot of terribleness, a lot of goodness. Just an awful lot. That's our power. If we don't like what reddit's doing, we can activate ad-block software, we can decrease the user base, and we can voice our disapproval with posts like these (which alter advertisers perception of the site)."
Ellenpaohate,39qqbb,rdrptr,4,Sun Jun 14 03:35:10 2015 UTC,You know how you get shadowbanned?  Posting to subs like FPH.

Ellenpaohate,39qqbb,animalinapark,-4,Sun Jun 14 05:11:27 2015 UTC,It's bigger than FPH. It's about a general degradation and pollution of the principles this site was founded on. And who gets to choose what and who is banned? We can't trust the current system to keep our interests in mind.
Ellenpaohate,39qqbb,rdrptr,3,Sun Jun 14 06:15:50 2015 UTC,"That's because you googled ""Reddit CEO Ellen Pao""... Try googling ""dumb cunt""."

I can kind of understand the attempts to make Reddit threads come up when people google her name. But just how often do you think people google 'dumb cunt'? Why is this even a goal, and what will it accomplish? Do you think that the people who google 'dumb cunt' are a key demographic to influence in this situation?"

Ellenpaohate,39s0xl,dietbroccoli,4,Sun Jun 14 06:15:18 2015 UTC,Gold is stupid and you gilders suck. FREE SPEECH BITCH
Ellenpaohate,39s0xl,howcheesy,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:11:23 2015 UTC,"It's not about ""free speech"" though, as that generally refers to the laws guaranteeing you not to be persecuted by your gouvernment for saying stuff. Neither Reddit nor this particular subreddit are the gouvernment and so they can censor us however they like.  Free speech isn't what's at stake. Their ideal of being the ""frontpage of the internet"", however, is. You're not a platform for freely exchanging opinions if you limit them to only the ones that currently suit you.  So what you should've said is ""since we should welcome all opinions, even the retarded ones, I can make a silly post to test publicly if your little corner of the system works and then gloat if it does, and gloat if it doesn't. Oh my I'm so clever. BITCH"""
Ellenpaohate,39s0xl,Zeichner,-4,Sun Jun 14 21:35:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't like the idea of Reddit being the ultimate ""free speech platform,"" I would much prefer it to be an ""intelligent speech platform.""  I objected to the name ""front page of the internet"" as well when it came out.    I mean ""free speech"" has all been a corporate ploy to get people in anyway; the Sears post long ago should have made people realize that.  At least now reddit is starting to use some civility in its banning and hopefully get rid of really assholish stuff."
Ellenpaohate,39s0xl,canisliz,2,Sun Jun 14 21:40:06 2015 UTC,"If you want them to start moderating everything and taking down subs you don't personally approve of, then it isn't free speech at all."
Ellenpaohate,39s0xl,canisliz,-4,Mon Jun 15 22:48:44 2015 UTC,"I'm OK with that.  I don't come to Reddit to hear every moron's asshole ideas.  I can go plenty of other places for that.  And believe it or not, you can discuss any idea you want without using the word ""nigger,"" for example."
Ellenpaohate,39s0xl,canisliz,2,Mon Jun 15 22:55:48 2015 UTC,"This is the internet man, people are going to say it along with other ""offensive"" stuff. You just have to get over it. That's why I go to places like gaming and comic books if I don't feel like hearing a bunch of idiots babble."
Ellenpaohate,39s0xl,FourNominalCents,-4,Mon Jun 15 23:04:22 2015 UTC,"Apparently, I don't have to get over it.  You have to get over the idea that this is a public place and you can do whatever you want."

My main issue is Ellen Pao's way of working.  My guess is they are trying to take control and ""disneyfy"" reddit so it can be sold as the next ""facebook"" to the mass public and advertisers.  Before long reddit will have ads, asks for your telephone number every time it gets and is all fluffy and friendly to all and for god sake above all political correct.

I asked if I/the sub was in danger of being banned and what I could do to rectify the situation, since I was adhering to all the rules.   That way, if it got banned, I had proof that it was a form of unnecessary censorship. They didn't respond.   That might be part of the reason."

At the time, he was 28 years-old, running his own firm, and getting chauffeured around Manhattan in a Bentley—the fringe benefits of having sued his former employer, Kidder Peabody, for short-changing him on his bonus. Fletcher, who is black, had won $1.3 million from Kidder, then owned by General Electric  GE -0.44% , and he was seeking $5 million more, claiming racial discrimination.      Amazing, her ponzi scheme husband actually made his initial fortune, millions of dollars, from claiming racial discrimination  because he didnt like how big his bonus was, and then he sued for more.

Or they would cross post something from a sub like /r/skincareaddiction[3] [2] or /r/makeupaddiction[4] [3] and then harass the OP based on their looks. Or the one time a woman posted in /r/sewing[5] [4] about a dress she made and that got harassment. Or when a couple met over GTA5 and that got cross-posted. Alright, let's start linking actual examples of harassment and chronic toxicity that FPH has done.  Thread 1: An open letter to all the fat fats who may be lurking here[6] ...[5]  Thread 2: Drama in /r/progresspics when OP's pictures get crossposted to /r/fatpeoplehate[7] .

Brigade happens on a comment he  made in the the sub yesterday about his face.[8] [7]  Thread 4: Big girl on r/unexpected is compared to a planet.

This led to /r/FPH brigading the sub[15] .[14]  Thread 11: FPH brigades /r/suicidewatch and tells a suicidal redditor to kill himself.[16] [15]  There is no double standard. You can't even begin to list examples of how SRS has harassed users to nearly the same degree (like the examples I've posted above). The worse they do on a regular basis is link to comments they disagree with and yell at them. The things they say are not nearly on the same level as what FPH did on a regular basis.  I believe you have a strawman view of what SRS is. Sure they're loud and obnoxious, they're disagreeable and often not open to debate...

Ellenpaohate,39kmxm,supersandwich100,6,Fri Jun 12 11:39:44 2015 UTC,"I doubt this is by accident, people are rallying, though somewhat less loudly, around a new, PC, 'trigger'less, unoffensive, and most importantly censored reddit.  It'll stop, just stick this in the sidebar, stop pleading, and move on. They'll run out of money for gold soon enough. The pleading only delights them, because for IWKs, it's ok to antagonize, as long as just know the other pig/bigot/*phobe is wrong."

Ellenpaohate,39l36r,alezit,10,Fri Jun 12 14:07:21 2015 UTC,"I love how the landing page ban reason is ""lack of moderation"". I wish we could ban the reddit staff from shit because they lack moderation in their diets."

They banned it and it wasn't even breaking the rules.  If /r/thinpeoplehate is harassment they also need to ban /r/ladyboners and /r/gentlemenboners and ALL the associated subs."

Ellenpaohate,39l7k9,wormmind,2,Fri Jun 12 14:40:45 2015 UTC,"Helen hurried down the elevator or rather she paced the elevator. She would have taken the stairs but there was such a lot on her mind, and there was the chocolate ice cream that was going to be an erogenous bomb on her tongue. The bodega across the street better have a tub or she would lose her shit and kill someone. She felt something hard in her purse.  As she passed through the lobby the mulatto security guard looked up from his desk. Her mother's voice echoed in her head, ""Half-breed. And not even a son?"" She felt anger and shame. Her world would be better. She was better. She was CEO. That was like God except better. Wasn't it?  Outside it was raining. Shit. She pulled her jacket up over her head. A taxi passed by and then she ran across the street into the golden bodega. There was some hooded freak at the counter waiting as a brown man counted out change. Helen put her hand into her purse and touched warm metal.  Helen went to the freezer at the back. They were out of chocolate. Damn. She grabbed a carton of pink strawberry. The ice cold container felt good on her hand.  ""Miss Helen,"" said the man at the counter. He was one of those hangovers from India that missed the homosexual post seventies cop slash mustache connotation. It wasn't even November for Christ sake. ""How may I help you?""  ""Just this,"" said Helen. She put it on the counter. Smile she thought. She felt the corners of her mouth pull.  ""I was just watching a show on psychopaths,"" said the mustache. She noticed his nose was pockmarked. A drinker? He wagged his head.  ""Oh?"" said Helen. Give me the fucking scream she thought.  He began to ring up the cold container. ""Yes. Most interesting. Ten dollars, please.""  Helen's phone sang. She looked in her purse. It wasn't her slick smartphone. It was the battered flip phone that her family had given her but had never rung before.  ""Hold on,"" said Helen. She flicked the phone open. ""Yes?""  A barrage of sounds like an old dial-up modem screeched. It was as though a veil had been ripped away. The phone fell from her hand. Her family, her job, and herself vanished. A pistol slid out of her purse. Had it always been there? The mustache looked at her iron dick.  ""Miss Helen?"" said the mustache.  ""Kill everyone,"" said a voice in her head."
