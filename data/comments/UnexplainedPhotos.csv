They got caught and were run down, rammed and then shot.   Their wrecked boat definitely doesn't look like something pirates would use to run down and board larger vessels. I doubt they were refugees and I don't think stowaways would be foolish enough to try to hide on a commercial fishing boat."

UnexplainedPhotos,3e0s9i,blitzballer,12,Tue Jul 21 02:02:45 2015 UTC,"So, I see this happening a lot with indigenous art in regions we don't have a clear view of history. Found art or inscriptions and have no idea how to translate? They have 4 similar traits to <insert X well-understood and well-documented group's art style, language style, etc>? There's NO way natives of Brazil could have ever been advanced to do that! Somehow the Phoenicians ended up here.  The simplest explanation is often the correct one, especially where these kinds of things are concerned. A group of ancient Southern Americans also managed to create a language and written alphabet at a time before written or recognized history. Many human cultures that never met each other have common traits within their languages. The language was probably lost sometime after this was inscribed, as was the case with many ancient languages/alphabets.  So since there is much less known history in South America and Africa than in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. Most archeologists make educated guesses, and having more written and oral history of a region makes it easier to decode those languages from inscriptions, ancient art, etc. That isn't to say that NO other languages or alphabets ever existed. Just that we know and can decipher these ones.  We still don't even know what caused the Mayan Empire to fall, and that was a huge civilization. A huge civilization that likely also absorbed many other civilizations and cultures during its growth period, perhaps even this one. The oldest actual writings found in Mesoamerica were dated to 500 BC, but that isn't to say that some culture didn't develop it before then, and the writings were just lost. The climate in much of the region is not conducive to preservation of much, and South America has lost so many indigenous groups that we probably know absolutely nothing about, let alone their languages.  It's just unfortunate that we may never know or understand what the people who put these inscriptions on this rock were trying to say, and we will likely never be able to relate its meanings to the history of the South American continent.   Then again, I could be totally wrong and this amazing find points to the fact that the Phoenicians found the Americas long before anyone else, which would be kinda cool. But...maybe South Americans did this on their own."

UnexplainedPhotos,3d61kp,blitzballer,14,Mon Jul 13 20:20:29 2015 UTC,"The sculpture became notable among fringe historians because of the resemblance of the motifs to some modern electrical lighting systems.  Mainstream Egyptologists take the view that it is a typical set of symbolic images from Egyptian mythology.  The view of Egyptologists is that the relief is a mythological depiction of a djed pillar and a lotus flower, spawning a snake within, representing aspects of Egyptian mythology. The Djed pillar is a symbol of stability which is also interpreted as the backbone of the god Osiris. In the carvings the four horizontal lines forming the capital of the djed are supplemented by human arms stretching out, as if the djed were a backbone. The arms hold up the snake within the lotus flower. The snakes coming from the lotus symbolize fertility, linked to the annual Nile flood.  In contrast to the mainstream interpretation, there is a pseudoscientific fringe hypothesis according to which the reliefs depict Ancient Egyptian electrical technology, based on comparison to similar modern devices (such as Geissler tubes, Crookes tubes, and arc lamps). J. N. Lockyer's passing reference to a colleague's humorous suggestion that electric lamps would explain the absence of lampblack deposits in the tombs has sometimes been forwarded as an argument supporting this particular interpretation (another argument being made is the use of a system of reflective mirrors). Proponents of this interpretation have also used a text referring to ""high poles covered with copper plates"" to argue this but Dr. Bolko Stern has written in detail explaining why the copper covered tops of poles (which were lower than the associated pylons) do not relate to electricity or lightning, pointing out that no evidence of anything used to manipulate electricity had been found in Egypt and that this was a magical and not a technical installation.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendera_light  http://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-technology/dendera-light-0081  http://www.doernenburg.alien.de/alternativ/dendera/dend00_e.php  http://www.catchpenny.org/dendera.html"

Alexander McCallum, a history researcher states multiple interpretations for the carvings exsist: ""Some people think that the Cochno Stone is a map showing the other settlements in the Clyde Valley - that's one of the theories. I think it was probably used for lots of things; it was never used for just one thing and over hundreds of years it changed use.""

They may have even known about this phenomenon and purposely set stuff up to see what it would look like. As well, they were at the pole, so these objects could have been on land (or ice) and not actually in the water, so we could be seeing tents, crates, temporary structures, etc. being reflected, refracted, and distorted.

In respect to the Admiral, the means to track him down are not going to be published so he is not inundated with calls but he was located. (We please ask, there are researchers currently corresponding with him, and we would prefer that no one track him down to ask for additional answers as this unfolds.)  The following is the update from Mr. Mistretta:  I asked Steve Murillo, head of UPARS, to speak with Admiral Dean R Sackett this morning. Steve is a former Navy pilot. Admiral Sackett was gracious enough to take the call, but steered away from the UFO question. Admiral Dean R Sackett said ""I only saw Ice"". He did agree to check out the pictures though email however, so we will see. This obviously doesn't prove anything in either direction. These could certainly be a hoax, or these are the real deal and Admiral Sackett is sticking to his security oath. Which incidentally, if that's the case, he has every right to do. Or these pictures are the real deal, and have no relationship with the Trepang submarine USS 674. There were apparently another sub in the region around the same time.

However, after some research, it is possible these were naval target balloons, and the USS Trepang was conducting a weapons test of some kind.  As indicated and referenced/sourced above, “From 22 February to 22 March [1971], the nuclear attack submarine operated beneath the northern ice cap, conducting extensive tests to provide data for her weapons systems, as well as carrying out scientific experiments concerning the movement, composition, and geological history of the cap itself.”  I searched the Library of Congress, and came up with a few examples of Balloon Carriers. They do have a resemblance. Here are the examples (it should be noted that the balloons in these photographs were photographed between 1910-1915… a considerable time difference between this case and these photographs.

When I go to Glastonbury, I usually use emergency shelters (large versions of the silver blankets at the end of races) to cover our tents. I couldn't get them for a price I was happy with this year so I tried plastic dust sheets instead. The ones I got were unbelievably thin white plastic sheets that measured 4m x 5m. They were plenty big enough to  cover tents but they were extremely flyaway...and flimsy.  I used my usual technique of wrapping the sheet tight around and under the tents (only the cheapy kind of two man pop-up jobs) and clipped the sheet around the frame. This, with the silver sheets, is a perfect way to completely cover the cheap tents and add a waterproof layer, and also a cooling/heating mechanism.  I don't recommend the plastic sheets though...at least, not the thin ones I got. Although my brother's cover survived, mine ripped open when someone caught their boot on it and eventually came off completely.  It didn't actually fly away (almost) but I imagine it looking exactly like the video.  Sorry, as I got to the end I realised how redundant that whole story was."

UnexplainedPhotos,3c7ufv,brezzz,14,Mon Jul 6 07:59:45 2015 UTC,"Orthorectification errors. Short of having a 3d model of the whole area including buildings (which providers are starting to do) the images get mapped to the limited terrain models of the area from radar, satellite, and old fashioned surveying and sometimes errors like this happen. Think projecting your photos onto a bed sheet which has major terrain features to scale but otherwise lacks detail. And the projectors for each photo are in the same place your camera was to scale, then you take a photo of your final work from above (kinda). You will only notice this kind of error especially with tall structures. If it was a truly orthorectified image then all you would see of those towers is a circle, but in the case of including very tall structures, you need quite a lot of images from every perspective and it becomes cumbersome, your effort would be better used in 3d modeling the area either by computer stitching or other measurement.   What happened is that one pass of aerial imagery got one tower in a good photo and then another pass got the other form a different angle, and it was not mapped correctly to the terrain.   TLDR: Think of 2 projectors with photos of each tower on the edge, on a bed sheet that approximates the terrain, but in the area the towers are in it's mostly flat because it wasn't surveyed to that level of detail. That's exactly what happened here."

For the ones taken below clouds, aerial photography (not satellites) is used, and stitching different aerial photographs together can do this.  The reason is that from a satellite, the camera sees the ground like this ""=(""  and to an aircraft-mounted camera, it sees the world more like this ""<(""  So, it is looking from the side in some instances, namely the sides and corners of each aerial photograph.   It is the stitched-edges of these aerial photographs that can make for this strange phenomenon."

I'd go to a university library and talk to the head research librarian if you really want unbiased information.

There are a bunch of people who watch that Ancient Aliens show and are convinced there are lizard people and then there are also people who have the hobby of 'debunking'.

UnexplainedPhotos,3bt2qr,darkehawk14,3,Wed Jul 1 22:49:04 2015 UTC,"As a historical text, the bible does have a lot of credibility. Most of what is found in the old testament (the great flood, famines, etc) have all been verified from outside ""scientific"" (some might not consider archeology science) evidence. The New Testament is also pretty historically accurate as well. Wars and major events cited actually happened. Jesus was a real person that existed.  As a historian, we use the bible just like we use any other historical text. Good historical researchers know that there is very often little to none un-biased, non-distorted, and non-analyzed accounts. Especially in the ancient times? Forget about it. You use first-hand accounts, journals, records, and letters, all of which were written by humans and, mostly, not intended for their current use. They are written and understood through the eyes of the author, and while sometimes that makes for a fantastical representation of the actual event, so little evidence survives that sometimes it is all you have to use.   The Bible is more corroborated than some historical texts that we take as truths."

UnexplainedPhotos,3bt2qr,EdgHG,8,Thu Jul 2 13:58:31 2015 UTC,"how about roman documents?   Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment,  or were nailed to crosses,   Tacitus wrote of Jesus (though not by name) in the Annals (Book 15, Chapter 44) Wikipedia or MIT Classics Department  There's also the letter From Pliny the Younger to Emperor Trajan, though in my research I rediscovered that it also did not mention Jesus by name. You can google it, however, if you wish.  And then a full wikipedia article on his historicity:   Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed, and most biblical scholars and classical historians see the theories of his non-existence as effectively refuted.[50][52][53][nb 9][70]   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus  Additionally, this site may interest you because someone has asked the same question from an athiest viewpoit (one I think you might share). It's here  It came up while I was googling resources and I thought that one commenter answered spot on:   Does not Tacitus' 1st Century writings remarking on someone named ""Christus"" who founded the movment whose constiuents he calls ""Christians"" and who was executed by Pontius Pilate in Judea provide just such an unbiased (if not rather pointedly anti-Christian bias) historical reference that lends credible evidence for the historicity of ""Jesus""? After all, Tacitus was a Roman senator and historian and most certainly not a Christian.  Here's the relevant passage:  ""Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular."" -- Tacitus, Annals 15.44  As for why so little was written in the 1st Century about ""Jesus"" by other-than Christians, I personally do not find this that surprising for three reasons: 1. As Marty recognizes, there wasn't that much effort placed on journalism or historical chronicling at the time; 2. Judea was just as much a third-world backwater location within the Roman Empire as might some little Central American country be considered by us today (how much do we know about or would care about some, say, Costa Rican religious figure?), thus as little notice was given ""Jesus"" at the time by Rome as was given to any of the other ""Messiah""-wannabes that preceded Jesus, of which at least three are known; and, 3. within four decades of his execution, Jerusalem was sacked, the Temple destroyed, and countless thousands killed during the Jewish uprising (occasioned by yet another ""Messiah"" wannabe), thus further decimating witnesses and destroying possible records regarding who or what this ""Jesus"" (Yeshua) person might have been.  Additionally, as Tacitus seems to strongly imply, it was only the spread of Christianity as the ""...most mischievous superstition"" Tacitus' considered it that brought it, and thus ""Christus"" to his attention enough to comment on it. Only after this ""superstition"" had ""...again broke out..."" was he apparently motivated enough to wish to thus chronicle and educate other Romans regarding it. Had not Christanity thus ""again broke(n) out"" and come to the attention of Rome, itself, no mention at all would have ever been made of ""Christus"" by someone of Tacitus' political stature... just as all the previous Jewish ""Messiahs"" hadn't.  Thus, it is thanks to Tacitus' disparaging reference to the movement and the briefest of retelling of its founder's execution under Pontius Pilate that we do seem to have a strong third-party and, more tellingly, rather anti-Christian bias from a Roman Senator that provides for me, at least, strong historical validation for the historicity of ""Jesus.""   There is more than NO proof, and while I do not consider myself a follower of it, I do have a Bachelor's in Ancient History and Religious Theory. I have taken countless classes on the bible, torah, talmud (which curiously is also used for validation of Jesus), the epic of gilgamesh, and roman/greek mythology. I have studied these topics extensively, and while there are definitely experts in the field who know more than I, I promise you, I know what the fuck I'm talking about.   Even if this is not proof enough, the historian community accepts the historical presence of Jesus (historians of all different religions agree) and they are the experts and forerunners in the field of history, people who have dedicated their lives to the studying the details of one small period of time or event, so I'm going to go ahead and say they know what they're talking about.   This being said, I will not claim that the things said about Jesus are all 100% true. I am not of the belief that everything that is said in the bible is true nor that every interpretation it makes is correct, but that is what historians are trained to do, look for the truth."
UnexplainedPhotos,3bt2qr,autowikibot,5,Thu Jul 2 15:03:49 2015 UTC,"Well, seeing as how Tacitus was writing more than 100 years after Jesus supposedly existed, how can you cite that as proof?  When the Catholic Church itself denies Josephus ever wrote anything about Jesus, and that the passages many try to attribute to him are forgeries, and the fact there are absolutely no Roman records from the time, which are actually fairly extent for the time , mention nothing about him.  The first Christians claimed that Christ never existed in human form, but was rather yet another ethereal being, like most other gods and deities of the day. He much later became a flesh and blood man who had walked the earth performing miracles.  Paul never mentioned Christ as a living person, but rather always referred to him in a spiritual context.  http://www.jesusneverexisted.com/paul.htm  The Epistle of Barnabas, written sometime between 70- 100 AD,which was considered, at the time, the most important treatise by an early Christian only mentions Christ in passing, and only in support of minor theological points.

UnexplainedPhotos,3bfzgn,SirReggie,3,Mon Jun 29 08:25:03 2015 UTC,"The facts would be ordinary, but the degree to which each of them would have to be verified would be extraordinary. When someone claims to have been brought back to life, as many people have, it is much more likely that one or more of the pieces of evidence has been fabricated or misinterpreted than it is that the person actually was resurrected. You'd have to rule out possibilities that would ordinarily be exotic.  For example, the possibility of it being an elaborate hoax with a twin brother, which is normally a pretty remote possibility when there is a question of identity, is staggeringly more likely than the possibility that some people actually can come back to life after having been dead.  And, particularly when you consider that someone might have something personally to gain by making an extraordinary claim, you have to go to great lengths to rule out deliberate deception, which is not typically a great concern for ordinary claims."
UnexplainedPhotos,3bfzgn,Nice_Dude,2,Mon Jun 29 11:18:26 2015 UTC,"Is it more likely that the death was faked or that the man came back to life? Why would we not initially assume and specifically test for the most likely possibility?  Your hypothetical is a totally unrealistic situation. I would never agree to kill someone for the sake of an argument. If someone 'invites' me to terminate their life, I'm going to be trying to find them medical or psychological help next, not considering that they might be immortal.  But supposing it was a situation that didn't put me at risk of being accused of murder... How do I verify that he's dead? Take a pulse? It's easy to mess that up, and there are cases of people surviving without a pulse for short periods. I suppose I could cut off his head, but that'd be either murdering him a second time or mutilating a corpse, neither of which are things I'd actually do, so again we're off in fantasy-land.  Then he comes back to life... Ok. How do I verify that he's the same guy? How do I know I wasn't fooled? It's more likely that I have been fooled than that the claim is true. It's even more likely that I have hallucinated it than that the claim is true. It's going to take a hell of a lot to make me believe that people can come back to life after dying.  But, even if I am fully convinced, and even if I am a reputable scientist and an expert doctor and an expert at identification, how would I convince anyone else that it was true without rigorous documentation, multiple witnesses, and exhaustive peer review? There's a huge difference between having being convinced of something and having proven it."

Little else is known about the markings yet.  There are 887 huge statues carved between AD 100 and 1800 — which are up to 10 metres tall. Members of the Easter Island Statue Project have been excavating the statues for years, and provided the first photos of their torsos in 2012. This surprised many, with people believing they only had heads.  “The reason people think they are (only) heads is there are about 150 statues buried up to the shoulders on the slope of a volcano, and these are the most famous, most beautiful and most photographed of all the Easter Island statues,” Jo Anne Van Tilburg from the Easter Island Statue Project said.  “This suggested to people who had not seen photos of (other unearthed statues) that they are heads only.”  Much remains unknown about the statues — how were they made? How was such a remote island populated? How were they moved around the island?

But on site are actual several Moais that differ in appearance as the Rapa Nui (Easter Island natives) carved those Moais for a long time and 'style' of the figures changed over time. See attached picture & compare the one on the left & the one in center. But I agree that the ship on the belly of the Moai most likely has been carved after the arrival of the first British expedition.  Also what the British sailors did was  a) use some of the Moais for target practice with their rifles. Bullet holes/scratch marks are still visible on some Moais b) excavate the best/prettiest Moai and ship it to the Motherland. It is still on exhibition in the British Museum in London  http://imgur.com/GpZkVLI

Yes, some of these do suggest prehistoric dates, or at least were used in prehistory, but also many of them are later, some are Roman, others are entirely medieval or later in date.

UnexplainedPhotos,39ntyd,darkehawk14,14,Sat Jun 13 09:57:06 2015 UTC,"Stone Age man created a massive network of underground tunnels criss-crossing Europe from Scotland to Turkey, a new book on the ancient superhighways has claimed.German archaeologist Dr Heinrich Kusch said evidence of the tunnels has been found under hundreds of Neolithic settlements all over the continent.   In his book - Secrets Of The Underground Door To An Ancient World - he claims the fact that so many have survived after 12,000 years shows that the original tunnel network must have been enormous.   'In Bavaria in Germany alone we have found 700metres of these underground tunnel networks. In Styria in Austria we have found 350metres,' he said.   'Across Europe there were thousands of them - from the north in Scotland down to the Mediterranean.   'Most are not much larger than big wormholes - just 70cm wide - just wide enough for a person to wriggle along but nothing else.   'They are interspersed with nooks, at some places it's larger and there is seating, or storage chambers and rooms.   'They do not all link up but taken together it is a massive underground network.'  Some experts believe the network was a way of protecting man from predators while others believe that some of the linked tunnels were used like motorways are today, for people to travel safely regardless of wars or violence or even weather above ground.   The book notes that chapels were often built by the entrances perhaps because the Church were afraid of the heathen legacy the tunnels might have represented, and wanted to negate their influence.   In some cases writings have been discovered referring to the tunnels seen as a gateway to the underworld."

UnexplainedPhotos,39fagu,blitzballer,12,Thu Jun 11 09:42:24 2015 UTC,My first thought would be tidal forces from the sun. Mercury has a relatively eccentric orbit that would contribute to the effect.
UnexplainedPhotos,39fagu,Julian_Baynes,17,Thu Jun 11 15:04:03 2015 UTC,"Mercury is the solar system's smallest and innermost world. It was an enigmatic planet for years. Until NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft became the first probe to orbit Mercury, the only other visits it received were the flybys made by NASA's Mariner 10 probe four decades ago. MESSENGER ended its mission in April by crashing into Mercury's surface.  Images that MESSENGER collected during its more than four years in orbit revealed a vast array of large fault scarps, or cliffs, on Mercury. These scarps resemble giant stair steps in the landscape — the largest are more than 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) long and more than 1.8 miles (3 km) high  These fault scarps form when rocks are pushed together, break and thrust upward along faults — or fractures — in the planet's crust. The most widely accepted model of the origin of these faults and scarps is that they are essentially wrinkles that formed on Mercury's surface as the planet's heart cooled over time, leading Mercury to shrink in size. Prior research has suggested that Mercury may have contracted by about 2.5 to 8.7 miles (4 to 14 km) in diameter.  If this planetwide array of fault scarps formed as Mercury shrank in size, these features should be uniformly scattered over the planet's surface. However, scientists now find there is a bewildering pattern to these fault scarps.  ""It is a real mystery,"" study lead author Thomas Watters, a planetary scientist at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum, told Space.com.  The scientists analyzed the largest, most prominent fault scarps on Mercury's surface, which were more than about 30 miles (50 km) long. Unexpectedly, they discovered many scarps are concentrated in two wide bands that run north to south and are located on almost opposite sides of the planet from each other.  http://www.space.com/29623-mercury-mystery-huge-cliff-patterns.html"

Found by Bresnik’s nephew, the film had sat on his father’s shelf for more than 50 years.

I googled some and found (also a few more pictures there) that the above statement is not true. The forum I found states that the paper edition of VG, biggest newspaper in Norway claimed the hole could be from equipment used to drill for water and the drillhead could have been faulty or broken making the hole not round as intended, this was known to happen. I think it is safe to assume this to be an experts opinion and not speculation from the journalist.  There are several kinds of drillbits available for doing such a job. These are also about the right size.  Still some mystery left, it is not known who did the drilling or why, but someone testing out some new/repaired equipment or a new method is at least plausible.   Other minor details that could be of interest; The hole is stated to be at least 4 metres long/deep and it was drilled closer to an 45 degree angle than 0 or 90 degree angle.

UnexplainedPhotos,38yh3h,ohio78,-7,Mon Jun 8 15:33:44 2015 UTC,My first thought when I seen it is that it looked like a statue of Noah's ark. The blobs could have been animals carved into the boat shaped stone. I maybe way off expecially given its region. Just saying that was my first thought.
UnexplainedPhotos,38yh3h,Sunconure11,10,Sun Jun 7 22:48:55 2015 UTC,"I think that would require this to have been Post-Colombian in origin, there is no evidence of the Christian faith in the Americas before Columbus. However, I cannot find the age of this structure, so there is a small chance it could be a statue of that, but, it is unlikely, even if its Post-Colombian."
UnexplainedPhotos,38yh3h,The_Sven,0,Mon Jun 8 00:28:48 2015 UTC,"Good point. However, maybe it wasn't Noah's boat but a similar myth. IIRC, several ancient middle-eastern religions had stories of floods and arks. Obviously it is extremely unlikely that this stone is inspired by the same stories, but Noah's Ark isn't that complex of a story to begin with.   God Creates Man.  Man ditches God.  God gets angry and wipes out Man except for that one guy and saves the animals.   Similar to how several independent civilizations can come up with a swastika, cross, and six-point star and have each symbol mean something different. It's a very basic thing and I wouldn't be surprised if several independent cultures came up with similar stories."

UnexplainedPhotos,38mqot,blitzballer,6,Fri Jun 5 05:31:58 2015 UTC,"info;  About 20 years ago, a mysterious object made a close approach to Earth that some believe was indicative of a controlled encounter. In 2017, the object is due to swing pass Earth again. Ross Jones reports.  IT CAN BE a depressing world. ISIS, earthquakes, species extinction, the Liberal Party.  Let’s, just for a moment, take a break and amuse ourselves with a little light mystery, Friday night ABC style. The denouement should be early 2017, just after the next election. It’s not a murder mystery, it’s a science mystery, but it does have suspects.  Back in the 1940’s, a small object, less than 20 metres across, slipped into earth’s heliocentric orbit.   Earth has a few companion asteroids, mostly harmless, but, if things go along as they are, this new companion will impact the planet in 2110. That’s a few generations down the track, so no worries you’d think.  The thing is, it shouldn’t be there.  Jim Scotti was senior research specialist at the Lunar and Planetary Lab of the University of Arizona. Back in December 1991, he was at the lab’s Kitts Peak (Arizona) telescope when, in the course of playing with various settings beyond the usual range, he noticed an odd thing. He named this thing 1991 VG.  links;  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_VG  http://coolinterestingstuff.com/unexplained-near-earth-object-1991-vg-could-be-an-alien-probe  http://wanderling.tripod.com/1991_vg.html"

Either this impacts in 2110 or it doesn't,  and if not will that be down to our actions or its own.  If it is natural then we will have to call on Bruce Willis and get it sorted, if its not natural then we should clear an area in Washington DC for it and its giant robot occupant."

The first Internet puzzle started on January 4, 2012, and ran for approximately one month. A second round began one year later on January 4, 2013, and a third round is ongoing following confirmation of a fresh clue posted on Twitter on January 4, 2014.   The stated intent was to recruit ""intelligent individuals"" by presenting a series of puzzles which were to be solved, each in order, to find the next. No new puzzles were published on January 4, 2015.  The puzzles focused heavily on data security, cryptography, and steganography.

Part of me feels slightly that I do, but i'm far from certain about it.  Long version:  The original audio was stripped from the YouTube video, and put through some extensive processing in SDR# and WavePad.  First, the audio was viewed via temporal FFT to isolate which frequencies were more often voice, and which frequencies could be more or less counted on to be carrier tone / noise. The identified bands were then EQ zeroed: 300-430 Hz, 689-817 Hz, 1205-1269 Hz, 1485-1550 Hz, 1571-1657 Hz, and 1894-2044 Hz.  After normalization, and selective noise filtration based upon a sample taken from the end of the recording, the results are much clearer, but still ring-modulated. (I'm actually talking to an audio engineer friend of mine, to see what can be done about canceling the ring modulation..I consider this guy a damn genius, so, if he can't do anything with it, it probably can't be done, period.)

UnexplainedPhotos,37wrlb,Ikari_Shinji_kun_01,32,Sun May 31 21:54:18 2015 UTC,"If you've ever seen a power transformer blow, you'd know exactly what those rings are.  Nothing mysterious there."
UnexplainedPhotos,37wrlb,elitistczar,2,Sun May 31 04:22:21 2015 UTC,Have you seen a large transformer blow before? Do these rings happen more often than not?
UnexplainedPhotos,37wrlb,I_AM_NOT_POOPING,4,Sun May 31 16:41:23 2015 UTC,"It depends on wind conditions and other factors such as whether the transformers are still suspended on the poles or not.  However, because of how they are built, these rings are common when the transformers blow.  Imagine an explosion blowing the lid off of a bucket and the resultant smoke goes straight up and in a perfectly expanding ring.  I think there's youtube videos of this happening.  I've only seen it once in person.  Bottom line, there's nothing ""mysterious"" about it. It's just the world we live in."

UnexplainedPhotos,37wrlb,rescueninja,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:36:26 2015 UTC,"These are ""smoke vortex rings."" The first time these were thought to be UFOs was at Ft. Belvior, Virginia in 1957. The Condon Committee report summation said this:   One morning in September, 1957 an Army private at Fort Belvoir, Va. was called from his barracks by his buddies to witness what appeared to be a black, ring-shaped UFO approaching. The private grabbed his Brownie camera and snapped 6 pictures of it.... After about 5 minutes, the black ring, which appeared ""solid"" to the soldier and glided steadily along, began to be ""engulfed in white smoke.""  Here are all the photographs taken of the ring using a simple Brownie camera, notice how the ring turns into a puffy circular cloud.  The only problem with the Ft. Belvior case is that they often did ""mock nuclear explosions"" (the alleged source of the ring) and yet the photographer and his friends thought there was something special with this object."

Was just an envelope with his name typed up on top of the mailbox. I suppose that leads credibility towards it being a fraud but also I kinda doubt the USPS would deliver mail from a mother fucking time traveler in the first place.

UnexplainedPhotos,37pltq,anthemlog,2,Fri May 29 19:55:10 2015 UTC,"This is what Spielberg always sites as having taken the wind out of his fascination with UFOs.  Just playing ""what if"", but if sentient beings were studying us and didn't want to actually make contact or be known, it would stand to reason that video/photography becoming ubiquitous would scare them away. I know, convenient, isn't it? But still logical."
UnexplainedPhotos,37pltq,dearmapmaker,4,Mon Jun 1 02:25:58 2015 UTC,"Thinking about it now... Most paranormal things used to be caught on film by accident. When people are filming vacations or nature or somesuch. And here we have this day and age when going outside and filming random things is getting less and less common...  Either that or the quality of cameras is making it easier to see that that UFO is indeed just a balloon, or that Boogfoot was a tree, that that ghost was just a shadow."
UnexplainedPhotos,37pltq,Grindstaff,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:43:21 2015 UTC,"Good point. I never thought about the lack of clarity in 8mm or VHS.   That's also a good point about the way people are using cameras, and there not being a thrill in just going outside and shooting video of the tops of trees. In the 80s, that really was something you would do. It certainly doesn't seem like there's less footage of UFOs being captured now. We don't have any concrete way to measure that. The big question is why didn't the rise of smart phones equal an explosion in UFO footage. There's a lot of reasons ut might not be that simple."
UnexplainedPhotos,37pltq,dearmapmaker,2,Tue Jun 2 10:50:43 2015 UTC,"Interesting about Spielberg, I didn't know that.   Maybe the development of camera-phones coincided with the successful completion of the aliens' observations and they hoovered up all the ghosts to use as fuel to get home with."

But thanks to NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft, which has been snapping pictures of the sun for the last five years, we can see this massive monster in action,  What you're seeing is a representation of one small part of the sun's colossal magnetic field. The sun's magnetic field is constantly changing unlike Earth's, which means it's growing and shrinking in strength.  Sometimes it can swell to be thousands of times stronger than Earth's. When that happens, it generates black blemishes called sunspots  If we go back to the first image, what you're seeing are two giant sunspots in blue and yellow. Both are large enough to completely swallow the Earth. The blue and yellow are false colors — in reality, the sunspots arppear black on the solar surface.  But these false colors serve an important purpose: The magnetic field of the sunspot in blue has an opposite charge from the sunspot in yellow.  The most stunning part of this recent SDO image (shown again below) are the white, ethereal wisps — called coronal loops — streaking across the solar surface. These pale whiskers represent hot gas outlining the magnetic field lines connecting the two sunspots.  Although sunspots were first studied in the 16th century by Galileo Galilei — the first scientist to observe the universe through a telescope — researchers are still unsure how these pockets of intense magnetic activity generate sunspots. But with SDO and its more than 100 million pictures taken over the last five years, scientists are hopeful that they will uncover the mysterious mechanism behind these enigmatic spots."

""I don't remember seeing it,"" said Pat Lawler, an Allouez resident whose brothers, Bernard and Edward, were included in the sign. ""The funny part of it is nobody could remember where that billboard was. I was old enough to be able to see it, but I don't remember where it was.""  Stolz also has no recollection of the sign. He never saw the billboard with his name listed on it, thinking it was put up while he was off to war and then taken down before he returned to his hometown.  ""Nobody knows for sure,"" Stolz said.  Stolz believes from looking at Martin's photograph of the billboard and what can be seen behind the sign that the sign stood near the corner of Webster and Allouez avenues.  Members from the Historic Allouez Society are creating a smaller replica sign as a tribute to the nearly 200 men and women from Allouez who served during the war.  The plan is to display the sign, which will measure 34 inches by 22 inches, in Green Isle Park, according to Rita Houston, a longtime Allouez resident and member of the village's historical society. Houston said the organization is picking up the cost for the new sign.  more here;  http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/news/local/2015/05/24/unsolved-mystery-wwii-billboard-allouez/27849039/"

Wolf-Rayet stars are known for their size - as large as 20 times the mass of the sun - but also because of how they swiftly shed their hydrogen envelope  ""We were excited to see this disk-like structure because it may be evidence for a Wolf-Rayet star forming from a binary interaction,"" study lead author Jon Mauerhan, of the University of California, Berkeley, said in a press release. ""There are very few examples in the galaxy of this process in action because this phase is short-lived, perhaps lasting only a hundred thousand years, while the timescale over which a resulting disk is visible could be only ten thousand years or less.""  The team said the disk surrounding Nasty 1 is unlike anything ever observed and is only a few thousand light years from Earth. They said one possibility for why such Wolf-Rayet stars deteriorate so quickly is because others around it are stealing resources.  ""We're finding that it is hard to form all the Wolf-Rayet stars we observe by the traditional wind mechanism, because mass loss isn't as strong as we used to think,"" study co-author Nathan Smith, of the University of Arizona in Tucson, said in the release. ""Mass exchange in binary systems seems to be vital to account for Wolf-Rayet stars and the supernovae they make, and catching binary stars in this short-lived phase will help us understand this process.""  Wolf-Rayet stars are ultimately mysterious and this study hopes to further expand the astronomical community's knowledge of them.  ""That's what we think is happening in Nasty 1,"" Mauerhan said. ""We think there is a Wolf-Rayet star buried inside the nebula, and we think the nebula is being created by this mass-transfer process. So this type of sloppy stellar cannibalism actually makes Nasty 1 a rather fitting nickname.""  http://www.universityherald.com/articles/19260/20150522/mysterious-wolf-rayet-star-observed-with-massive-gas-disk.htm"

UnexplainedPhotos,374h4z,blitzballer,0,Sun May 24 20:09:49 2015 UTC,"The CEFAA, a government agency investigating unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) within the department of civil aeronautics (DGAC) in Chile, has released a summary of its meticulous investigation into the relatively recent ""AGA case.""  The acronym ""AGA"" refers to the prestigious Air Force War Academy (Academia de Guerra Aérea) in Santiago, Chile, which provides training for high level Air Force officers.  Here is what happened: At about 7:45 pm on September 3, 2012, a paramedic and an emergency medical technician (EMT) stopped to fill up an ambulance from the Air Force Hospital at the fuel pump on the Academy grounds. A sergeant, responsible for overseeing the security of the facility, was assisting with the refueling.  Suddenly, they observed five lights coming over the Andes mountains from the Northeast, creating a horizontal formation and moving towards the Academy. At first, they thought this must be helicopters rehearsing for an annual military parade to take place later that month. However, as the lights drew nearer, the sergeant, who had spent 27 years in the Air Force, realized they were not helicopters. They made no sound and were clearly something highly unusual.  Startled, he ran towards the guard post at the main entrance and shouted the name of the guard who was inside. The ambulance driver and the EMT each pulled out their cell phones and began making videos of the strange formations.  The lights then descended even closer to the Academy grounds, and all three watched them change from a straight line into first a triangle, and then a circle, as they hovered nearby. The phenomenon then withdrew back towards the mountains and disappeared from view. The cameras were running for most of the display, until the batteries ran out. It lasted a few minutes.  more;  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leslie-kean/exclusive-new-video-of-unexplained-aerial-phenomenon-from-chile_b_7308576.html"

This brings into question the evolution of our entire species, as well as the history of the development of tools.   They are unsure which species of human predecessors are responsible for these tools, and how widespread tool use was at the time.   EDIT: Also, everyone keep in mind that, paleoanthropologically/psychologically speaking, tool use is even something as simple as using a stick as a lever or using a rock to crush nuts. These rocks even show a little evidence of being purposely shaped to improve their use (much like crows and ravens will bend sticks or pieces of metal to better suit being used as a probe or digging tool).

Using this information it can be extrapolated (even though no one has lived 700,000 + years) that after a given amount of time, there will only be a certain amount of that element left in an object, due to the rest having spontaneously decaying. This is by no means perfect, and has a margin of error associated with it, which is why they can't make the figure more exact to something like 734,823 years. With a number like 700,000 though, you can be pretty certain that this object does in fact predate other known tools by many 100,000 years.

UnexplainedPhotos,36jg7i,blitzballer,18,Tue May 19 20:54:51 2015 UTC,"The three objects are located in the Aker region of the comet. The largest (labelled 3), which measures approximately 100 feet (30 meters) in diameter, appears to be making very little contact with the surface. It also looks like it’s resting on the rim of a small depression.  These features are reminiscent of “balancing rocks” on Earth. They touch the ground with only a tiny fraction of their surface, and they often look very precarious. They can form any number of ways, including the erosion of softer materials in the bedrock, or via glacial melting, i.e. “erratics.”  “How this apparent balancing rock on Comet 67P/C-G was formed is not clear at this point,” noted OSIRIS Principal Investigator Holger Sierks at the ESA’s Rosetta blog."
UnexplainedPhotos,36jg7i,black_flag_4ever,7,Tue May 19 20:55:42 2015 UTC,"It's interesting that there's enough gravity on the comet to do that. Of course, I know almost nothing about how gravity would work on a comet, but I never really thought about it before."
UnexplainedPhotos,36jg7i,dripdroponmytiptop,28,Wed May 20 04:24:20 2015 UTC,"okay, I'm going to explain these.  The surface of comets and some asteroids are static-electrically charged. It's what holds the comets and dust to the surface, since gravity is too weak, and because there are forces due to the sun blasting away water using its radiation, which is called sublimation. There's been satellites that've captured that sublimated dust and ice, to see if there are amino acids in it the same as there were on primordial earth, and surprisingly, there were!  When Philae was about to touch down there was a very real threat that the static electricity on the surface of the comet would fry it like a fucking egg and zap all it's electronics. Thankfully that didn't happen. Satellites have taken pictures of arcing electricity flashes on comets and asteroids before, and they were afraid the same thing would happen to poor little Philae.  The amino acids that they found in the sublimated dust captured in comet trails, were complex ones: complex amino acids that could only be made with lots of energy, the kind that is released when those arc flashes discharge on the surface of comets. Theses ""carpet shuffle shocks"" would impact the surface. You can see photographs, like this one, where there are many crater-like blobs in a line, as the discharge travelled before finishing. They replicated the surface here on earth and discharged electricity onto it- the same crater lines with blobs in them happened.   The blobs were solidified dust, hardened by the electricity melting them and them resolidifying immediately. They formed shapes that were like peanuts, and were found when they dug them up in the dusty sand in the earth experiments. They surmise the reason 67P is shaped like a duck or a peanut, is the same: during the impact of something huge, probably planets or something left over from when our solar system began coalescing, a large enough impact formed the 67P comet shape. Which is just like the peanut impact blobs.  What you're seeing here, are the wide ends of blobs formed in arc discharges of electricity on the surface of 67P. The dust has probably sublimated away, but the solid bit, still buried in there, remains. It looks like it's standing, but it's a peanut-shaped rock stuck in the debris.  This is all called the electric comet theory and with the discovery of very little ice on 67P it's only grown stronger. Of cousre, we don't know much, but this all seems to be well supported."

It would make sense, considering that the craft that landed on the comet, which ways a few tons here, weighs only about 1 gram on the comet, so if some chunks, which would be incredibly light, are broken off, but haven't reached escape velocity or orbital velocity eventually settle back down, they can if undisturbed, potentially just balance until enough dust hits them or the comet accelerates.  Edit: oops, ""weighs a gram."" Embarrassing. My bad. It weighs about 4 Newtons."

I read that drivers had gone past that night and assumed it was nothing but an incident involving a drunk driver and I always wondered if there was something that could have been done that night that would have prevented the case from going cold.  ""Brianna's vehicle, a pale green four-door 1985 Oldsmobile sedan, was found abandoned on March 20, off East Berkshire Road and Route 118, across Dutchburn Farm Road, about a mile outside of Montgomery. It was parked partially inside an abandoned barn. Two of Brianna's uncashed paychecks were on the front seat of the car. She also left behind all her clothing, her medicine, driver's license, her makeup, and her contact lenses. Some of her belongings were strewn on the ground in front of the car. A woman's fleece jacket was found in a field near Brianna's car, but it apparently did not belong to her.""

Although officials suspected the objects were not from the Boeing 777, which vanished last March with 239 people on board, a second ship sent down an unmanned sub to take a closer look to be sure.  It found a large number of small objects and several larger items, the biggest of which was 20ft (6 metres) long.  An analysis of photos taken by a camera that was also sent down has revealed the debris came from a previously unchartered shipwreck.  Marine archaeologists are examining the photos to see if they can identify the ship. The pictures show an anchor and what appear to be lumps of coal.  Peter Foley, the ATSB's Director of the Operational Search For Flight 370, said: ""It's a fascinating find, but it's not what we're looking for.  ""We're not pausing in the search for MH370, in fact the vessels have already moved on to continue the mission.""

UnexplainedPhotos,35u6mq,darkehawk14,1 point,Thu May 14 01:12:23 2015 UTC,"True, and assuming he does have amnesia, I just wonder why no one from his past has identified him. I guess some people don't have family or close friends, so it's possible, it just seems odd."
UnexplainedPhotos,35u6mq,jimmycrackcorn123,2,Thu May 14 01:29:35 2015 UTC,Odd is if he does have memory loss and people who have tried to help get rebuffed.  Maybe it is partial memory loss.  And he knows he doesn't want to be found.

He is the only American citizen officially listed as missing despite his whereabouts being known.[1] Kyle is white and appears to be in his 50s or 60s.[2][timeframe?] He is 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m) tall and weighs 240 pounds (110 kg).[3] He has graying hair with a receding hairline, and blue-green eyes.[2] For many years after his amnesia Kyle was homeless and had been unable to obtain employment as he was unable to remember his full Social Security number.[4] Despite widespread media coverage, no one has yet come forward claiming to have known Benjaman Kyle in his past life.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjaman_Kyle"

UnexplainedPhotos,35u6mq,Augment,6,Sat May 30 06:18:56 2015 UTC,I've read about this man in the past.  Some genealogist in Florida wrote a long form article about him and implies that he is either lying to conceal his identity for some reason or at the least is unconcerned with discovering who he was/is.  If I recall correctly an employee of a Waffle House restaurant claims he was a coworker but of course he refused to follow up on the lead.  My bet is he did something terribly awful and doesn't want to deal with the consequences.

Websleuths exhausted so many leads for him and came to the conclusion he was a fraud. Every professional who encounters Mr Kyle ends up the same.

UnexplainedPhotos,35rt4b,blitzballer,8,Tue May 12 23:51:31 2015 UTC,"The microphones picked up ""infrasound"" — frequencies so low that they can't be heard by human ears. But speeding up the recordings means that the sounds can be heard.  The recordings were taken from a helium balloon in August last year. The microphones dangled over New Mexico and Arizona and were one of 10 sent out by Nasa as part of the High Altitude Student Platform.  That helped get the first infrasound recordings ever taken at such altitudes, according to Daniel Bowman, the University of North Carolina student who captured the sounds.  Bowman described the sounds as ""like the X-Files"", and scientists aren't sure where they came from.  Current guesses include sound from a wind farm, the ocean, wind or vibrations from cables on the balloon, according to Live Science. The scientists will be sending more devices up as part of the 2015 run of the project, and hope that they can learn more then.  ""I was surprised by the sheer complexity of the signal,"" Bowman told Live Science. ""I expected to see a few little stripes.""  Bowman hopes that the recordings will be able to revive interest in infrasound recordings, which haven't been made in the stratosphere for 50 years. Some scientists have proposed sending similar equipment to the moon and Mars, where it might be able to pick up information about weather and the environment."

Ruin it by including more media because there's only so many decent unexplained photos out there and the wonderful creator of the sub already submitted 99% of them. So, instead of letting it die (saving it, according to you), we can perpetuate discussions and exposure to new, awesome, unexplained phenomena (ruining it, according to you).   Unless you think that because the original idea wasn't as encompassing as the unexpected popularity of the sub would require, we should instead create spin-off subreddits so we have to go to three different subs just to see all the content instead of just expanding the rules a little and allowing more than just pictures, after a majority vote and approval from the sub's creator."

Probably a shorebird flying only a few inches over the water so that you don't see any reflection. Pretty normal behavior for a shorebird, and the size, shape, color, and motion all match up well.  Could also be another type of bird, but I'd bet against a fish -- the bright color and speed do not make sense, particularly for a lake. Almost all fish are dark on top and bright on bottom for camouflaging purposes; I'd doubt there is even a lake fish in Holland that fits the video's description, unless it was albino. Even then the movement doesn't make sense. All told I'm pretty sure this is a solitary bird."

Grabbing her camera, she began to recording the loud, eerie howls as they echoed through the air from an unknown location somewhere far in the distance. “In the moment I had goosebumps on my arm.” Melissa said. The following day, another B.C. resident, Katherine Wookey, heard the same noises while having her morning coffee. She too captured audio of the mysterious noises. Back in 2013, Katherine captured audio of the mysterious sounds when they first hit British Columbia. Her video quickly went viral, and currently has 2.7 millions views. In 2013, the city released a statement claiming the sounds were caused by a worker who was grinding down the blade of a grader. For these latest noises, the city has yet to make a comment. Theories about these latest noises range from a train, to construction work, to another grader blade being grinded down  http://theparanormalblog.tumblr.com/post/118589755056/strange-sounds-return-to-british-columbia-on-may#notes"

UnexplainedPhotos,35j7bh,notfromhere23,2,Mon May 11 03:47:12 2015 UTC,"I'm desperately trying to find it, but there was a great documentary on the BBC (here in the UK) where they examine strange natural events, like animal behaviour and things like this. Think it had a guy called Chris Packham narrating if anyone wants to track it down.  They talked about a growing belief about certain sounds travelling up to the atmosphere and bouncing back due to certain conditions. This distorts the sounds and makes them appear to be coming from the sky.   It was quite an interesting and believable theory. It explained how the sound was coming from long distances, the appearance of it emanating from the sky, and the often distorted nature. The only thing I couldn't remember it explaining was the amplification.   Either way as others have said, this sounds quite like a stuck break on a railway car, would be interesting to see a map of the area and how close a railway line is. Strange that this is the only sound though if that is the case, you'd expect to hear more from the rest of the carriages or train--- also that's a moving source, so how would the sound stay in the perfect conditions for it to keep going for so long."

Hiram Chittenden, an early engineer in the park refers to an “overhead sound” in his 1895 book, Yellowstone National Park. Chittenden writes, “A most singular and interesting acoustic phenomenon of this region, although rarely noticed by tourists, is the occurrence of strange and indefinable overhead sounds. They have long been noted by explorers, but only in the vicinity of Shoshone and Yellowstone Lakes.” Lake music continues to be heard by those who visit the park and camp in the Lake area. The number of reports has led to scientific studies, yet no one has been able to conclude what causes the buzzing noise."

In our case, and I'd wonder if also in the Yellowstone instances, it's caused by minimal geological activity (teensy earthquakes, I think?). I believe there is also some interplay between those ground movements and the water, amplifying the vibrations into strangely harmonic sounds. Has this come up with any other bodies of water near fault lines or similar?"

UnexplainedPhotos,350dpw,blitzballer,1 point,Wed May 6 01:36:30 2015 UTC,"The earliest Nazca Lines were created so pilgrims could view the markings along a ritual processional route, the researchers said. But later people may have smashed ceramic pots on the ground where the lines intersected as part of an ancient religious rite, according to a study presented here on April 16 at the 80th annual meeting of the Society for American Archeology.  What's more, the Nazca Lines may have been created by at least two different groups of people who lived in different regions of the desert plateau, researchers said  In one of the driest places on Earth, locked between the Andes Mountains and the coast, more than a thousand geoglyphs dot the landscape. People from an ancient civilization created the shapes between 200 B.C. and A.D. 600, by removing the reddish rocks on the surface of the desert, revealing the white-hued earth beneath.  The strange shapes in the desert include animals such as camelids, dogs and monkeys, as well as fanciful supernatural beings, scenes of decapitation and trophy heads, and geometric designs such as trapezoids, lines and triangles. Though the mysterious shapes gained widespread attention in the 1920s, when plane passengers saw them from above, people who lived there likely saw them even earlier while walking the hilltops in the Nazca plateau.  Archaeologists have long puzzled over the purpose of the Nazca Lines. Some researchers have argued the Nazca lines form a labyrinth. Others have said the lines and figures matched up with the constellations in the sky or with subterranean water routes. And still others have said the Nazca Lines were part of an ancient pilgrimage route.  http://www.foxnews.com/science/2015/05/04/mysterious-nazca-line-geoglyphs-formed-ancient-pilgrimage-route/"
UnexplainedPhotos,34v5r3,blitzballer,30,Mon May 4 20:44:03 2015 UTC,"The text looks like something generated with a Markov chain pseudo-natural-language text generator. It's a program that knows roughly which words go together and how, so it produces text that resembles functional sentences that should mean something, but it has no knowledge of the actual meaning of the words so there is zero real sense to the text. The effect is often rather creepy."
UnexplainedPhotos,34v5r3,orost,16,Tue May 5 02:32:04 2015 UTC,"It seems kinda like this, I just fed 'conspiracy', 'government' and 'privacy' into the generator:   Privacy has not, and likely never will be obstreperous. Humankind will always validate government; whether by agronomists or of the account. Authorities which intercedes lies in the study of reality as well as the study of philosophy. Hence, authorities might engender mournful adjurations for incarceration which foretell periodicity.  As I have learned in my semantics class, seclusion is the most fundamental advocate of humankind. While the pendulum emits plasmas, the same brain may produce two different neutrinoes. Radiation receives a gamma ray to transmit orbitals to the sanction. a neuron at ouster is not the only thing simulation implodes; it also transmits brains by inspections with confederacy. The more the exposition by intensification can zealously be excess, the sooner insinuations ruminate. Since all of the propagandists are induced of regime, salvers for an analysis homogenize equally on confederacy.  A exile to the realm of semiotics, especially for resourcefulness, will be presumptuous, obstreperous, and increasing with regime. Incursion by seclusion changes conspiracy which unsubstantiates inducement. Also, a neutrino at perjury is not the only thing the plasma reproduces; it also catalyzes gravity of privacy. In my experience, just about all of the administrations on our personal demonstration to the reprobate we disseminate reiterate a diagnosis and depreciate ateliers for apprentices. Even so, armed with the knowledge that dislocation that should be a commencement or subjugates probes insists, many of the scenarios at my response provision whiner but forsake the people in question. My aborigine may be a respondent. Conspiracy which will rivetingly be privation that yields is misplaced yet somehow classic with our personal proclamation by the device we augment as well. The development is banal but not howling, not militate. My assassin seethes. By interceding, a tenacious conspiracy can be more parsimoniously demarcated.  According to professor of philosophy Oscar Wilde, privacy is the most fundamental assassination of human life. Though interference reacts, a gamma ray of the affirmation processes brains on utterances for severance to the area of theory of knowledge. The same pendulum may transmit two different gamma rays at quips to emit gravity. a neuron to the epigraph is not the only thing the orbital inverts; it also counteracts simulation with privacy. The more escapades expose the dictum, the more the confrontationally and deliberately virtuous community contradicts protrusion that should lividly be obloquy. a dearth of privateness changes the postulate by government.  Conspiracy of convulsions will always be an experience of society. a explanation might, still yet, be affectionately in the way we sequester torpor. The abominable authorities changes an abundance of privateness. Government has not, and probably never will be masochistic. As a result of the fact that government ponders injunctions which convulse, human society should menace authorities immediately."

People were made aware of the hundreds of unnerving messages that were posted by a Canadian woman named Karin Catherine Waldegrave. Her messages read like the ramblings of a deranged conspiracy theory kook, however it wasn’t what she said that unnerved many. It was the fact that she was having a conversation with her own self  According to her Facebook profile, Karin Catherine Waldegrave was born in London and studied at the University of Toronto, Canada. Earning herself a Ph.D. during her time there. According to her profile she is well traveled and speaks several different languages including  French, Estonian, Latvian, English, Russian, Gallic, Latin, and German. Proof of this was often times seen in her multi language replies to herself. However most of her posts were in English and read like chopped sentences from random texts.  There is a clear distinction between the coherent and incoherent posts made only a day apart by Karin or whoever was responsible for creating the account. It is because of this “switch” in text that many online users began to question the woman’s sanity. The word schizophrenic appeared alongside the link to her Facebook profile in many online forums. Soon, more posts were uncovered and shared amongst many.  In her profile, there were only a handful of personal images Karin uploaded. Strangely enough, they all displayed signs of film damage  Karin then begins to mention the FBI and CIA on her posts, talking about being controlled and monitored by them, the men in black. She mentions the illegal and perverse doings of the “Elite” and how she knows several international criminal networks.  This of course sparks theories of her possible involvement in the infamous government project, MKUltra. However the more you read into her posts, it becomes more and more apparent that none of it makes any sense"

The glare looks like it's a long, stationary thing (hair) or a small, fast-moving thing (bug), so probably not dust in this case. Nothing spooky, just something you didn't notice at the time causing some glare on your photos."
UnexplainedPhotos,34xwvs,tendorphin,3,Tue May 5 14:47:19 2015 UTC,"What I mean is, the shape is very similar in photos 1, 2, 3, and 4. Photo 6 doesn't have enough of it to say if it is the same shape, as it is cut off and only about half as long as the others. I don't see anything in photos 5 and 7. Were it a hair stuck on the camera or your hand, the wind or just motion could move it. It would be retaining its shape, but will have changed its position in front of the lens.   And the shape is not a unique one. It is a slight curve. Bugs often fly in curved paths, especially when seen in cameras, as they are usually trying to avoid or go toward the person standing there. The fact that the glare and shape remain so similar leads me to believe it is more likely a hair in front of the lens than a bug, though, and we see it slowly coming loose and eventually not being in front of the lens anymore.   Here are some examples of other photos with hair in front of the lens. The glare and transparency are very similar:   Example 1  Example 2  Example 3  None are exact, but the one in your case was much closer to the lens.  Edit: it would have appeared to move around due to glare. It can only be seen if reflecting light directly back into the lens. It appears to be so close to the lens that only certain angles would allow for such light to reflect off of the hair and into the lens.  Edit 2: why are you not OP?"

Ideal situation:   Dictionary containing a date key and a complex data type item.   Data type contains:     List of image filename strings  List of relevant link strings (links specifically dealing with the article) String for the original ad's text List of article link strings  (articles from matching dates and regions found in these ads)  A string representing the date the ad was posted   NOTE: italicized items can be any data type, but please specify which data type you went with. However it would be preferred if these items could be the same data type as each other.   If you can think of or come across any other possible sub categories please feel free to add them, but please also indicate what was added.  To supplement this:     A folder containing the relevant images that are named in a way that matches all lists of image filename strings   NOTE: If any other pointers were added in the data type portion, please include a folder of those items as well, or include relevant notes on what these new pointers point to   Also was thinking saving this to something like a serialized file? Assuming you let me know the format it was saved in    NOTE ON EVERYTHING:   If you want to do this same thing with folders of files and a text file that has headers for each of these items is another option. Example:   IMAGES: enter filename here enter filename here enter filename here LINKS: enter link here enter link here enter link here AD: enter text here(no returns) ARTICLES: enter link here enter link here enter link here DATE: enter date here    If no data is available for a data type that has been added, set default to null or an empty string (depending on what data types you go with)"

My plan is to plug all of this in to a Dictionary of a data type I'm going to make up, and keyed by the date of the article. So you can pull this data in whichever format, I'm just looking for it to be organized by date so that it can be easily uploaded in to the records.

This one particularly seems to copy a few of Laffoleys distinctive features. It looks a lot more amateurish though; also it looks like it's been assembled at least partially on a photocopier. An enterprising investigative journalist might go through local libraries looking for source books some of these images came from, and once having identified a likely target, stake out the photocopiers there throughout April."

The first edition was printed using Jim Garrison's Xerox printer in 1963.  The second edition was published under the title ""Principia Discordia or How The West Was Lost"" in a limited edition of five copies in 1965. The title, literally meaning ""Discordant Principles"", is in keeping with the tendency of Latin to prefer hypotactic grammatical arrangements. In English, one would expect the title to be ""Principles of Discordance.""    Image i - The Loompanics ""Yellow Cover"" combined 4th & 5th Edition Principia Discordia, (1979).

UnexplainedPhotos,34gjtm,uututhrwa,23,Fri May 1 02:31:58 2015 UTC,"Unlikely. The texts have internal consistency, the poster is able to manage the task of hiring an intermediary and organising the publishing long-term, and they apparently are able to afford the fairly hefty costs involved.  Texts by mentally ill people tend to betray themselves fairly quickly, the person is not trying to hide information, they are trying to communicate it, often incoherently and in a ""pressured"" manner.  These are cyphers or coded documents. There's a ""lore"" behind the content, and an apparent long term goal at work here."
UnexplainedPhotos,34gjtm,CaerBannog,2,Fri May 1 02:35:19 2015 UTC,"I think there might be a cypher but 90% of the content in there must be some kind of elaborate ""artistic"" joke.   Texts by mentally ill people tend to betray themselves fairly quickly, the person is not trying to hide information, they are trying to communicate it, often incoherently and in a ""pressured"" manner.   An author who is only pretending to be nuts will usually have something in there that will come off like a ""punchline"".   Or the text might look like at any moment he can ""stay reasonable"" then switch to something bizzare and switch back to reason (often done for comedic effect).  If there's a punchline or arbitrary changes of the level of craziness, or the text/art seems to be all about being bizzarre and outrageous without much of a serious message or tone, then it's 99% chance it's fake."

UnexplainedPhotos,340qxf,breakingthesame,25,Mon Apr 27 11:49:20 2015 UTC,Did some googling and there's some decent discussion on it here. Consensus seems to be that it's a bit of debris that came off during ascent.
UnexplainedPhotos,340qxf,JustVan,7,Mon Apr 27 13:46:05 2015 UTC,Good find! It seems like such a massive object though. Hardly something I would think just broke off of the moon.
UnexplainedPhotos,340qxf,gmz_88,15,Mon Apr 27 13:58:19 2015 UTC,"It is impossible to tell the size of the object in the picture because we don't have any reference to scale or distance. The thing could be massive and really far away, or small and close.   Also, what /u/JustVan means by debris is not from the moon itself like dust and rocks, but debris from the lander stage.  That bottom part of the lander covered in golden foil-type insulation stays on the moon and the top part ascends. Like so.   So the explanation is that a part of the insulation detached from the lander."
UnexplainedPhotos,340qxf,JustVan,5,Mon Apr 27 15:58:43 2015 UTC,"I actually think we can tell some of the size based on the shadow's terminator line.  It's a very broad, soft blur. Compare the terminator line on the object to any shadows on the moon below. If the object was big that line would be a lot sharper as the light moved over a vast, distant area. But it's a very broad, blurry line because it's a small object close to the camera.  I suspect it's probably a bit of foil or other debris from the launcher. (Never thought it was moon debris.)"
UnexplainedPhotos,340qxf,TheOnlyOtherRedditor,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:02:47 2015 UTC,"Also think about it logically, we can't tell the size of the object because it's a flat photo, but the astronauts had depth perception, if they had seen some large mass floating out there wouldn't they have taken more pictures of it. Chances are it was just some small foil that was close to the spacecraft and moved into the shot without the photographer noticing."
UnexplainedPhotos,340qxf,WretchedRob,2,Tue Apr 28 02:51:44 2015 UTC,Ohh ok. I was confused thanks for clearing that up!
UnexplainedPhotos,340qxf,JustVan,2,Mon Apr 27 22:02:22 2015 UTC,"it almost looks like a tear/hole in a photograph, and that photograph was digitally scanned/digitally photographed"
UnexplainedPhotos,340qxf,WretchedRob,2,Tue Apr 28 01:22:40 2015 UTC,"If you bring it into an image editing program you can see that there's a ""dark side"" to the object. Where it goes into shadow is actually a fold and you can bring out part of the dark side. I think it's a folded bit of gold foil or similar debris from the lander that broke off when they broke orbit to leave the moon."

UnexplainedPhotos,340qxf,urssmorris,3,Mon Apr 27 14:20:05 2015 UTC,I have a question for you broskis about the moon.   What is the best (if any) evidence that there could be something on the moon that shouldn't be there?  I know there is testimony but how much of that can you really go on. I remember reading about a documented project way back in the day where they looked for anomolies on the moon etc.  I'm just fascinated at the idea that there could be bases/ancient structures on the moon.

UnexplainedPhotos,340qxf,blitzballer,0,Mon Apr 27 14:26:13 2015 UTC,"Im not entirely sure. It really raises more questions though. Is the other part of it or the rest of it blurred out? Shouldnt light be hitting it the same way as its hitting the moon? Is it technology? It cant be a meteor we would have known about it already.

He saw the anomaly on the picture captured by space capsule Mercury-Redstone 1A on December 19, 1960.  “I found a disk in some photos of the Mercury mission. The mission took place in December of 1960, and why wouldn’t aliens be interested in watching a historical moment in human history?” Waring wrote on his blog, which charts evidence of UFOs and alien life.  “Especially since the capsule was unmanned, there were no worries that they would be seen. It’s actually the earth in the background and the UFO is in space observing the Mercury capsule,” he said.  “The disk is hard to make out in the first photo, but three photos later it’s easy to see. It looks like a classic disk with a wedge cut out of it,” he added.  http://www.techienews.co.uk/9728770/ufo-observed-nasas-mercury-mission-55-years-back-report-says/"

UnexplainedPhotos,33egk2,Jumaki15,3,Wed Apr 22 00:50:33 2015 UTC,"THE HISTORY CHANNEL IS ON IT, GUYS."
UnexplainedPhotos,33egk2,right_bank_cafe,2,Wed Apr 22 00:53:00 2015 UTC,"I was a bit intrigued by this when I first saw it. After posting this case file, I received a lot of feedback.  Those skeptical on the case proposed that it was a reflection of something inside the craft. So, I did a bit of analysis to see if that theory holds water.  I used 2 photos from the string above. Photo #MR-1A-9186-266 (B&W) and also Photo #MR-1A-9186-269 (Red Tint). I feel that you can discount this theory of a reflection, due to the fact the “reflection” does not appear in 2 of the photos in between these two frames in or near the spot, and also the theory ignores Photo #MR-1A-9186-268 which may show the object much farther in the background.  But, for sake of argument, we will dismiss those photos and deal with the two argued as a reflection. I used, what I believe, is the only constant (non-moving) object in the frame of photos – the reflection of the mission clock. The spacecraft is moving, so therefore, objects on the outside of the spacecraft would be moving their position in the frame as well.  Matching the clock on the photos, would show what was constant inside the craft as it would appear in the same exact position, and what was ‘moving’ outside the craft therefore being in different positions as the spacecraft moved.  Here is the overlay: http://imgur.com/4vshXJX    By matching up the clock on the top left, you can see the “object” in question appears to be in a different position, therefore potentially ruling out it’s a reflection inside the craft of an object. If it was a reflection, once the clocks were lined up, the “reflection” would also be on top of each other.  If anyone is interested in even more analysis, the full string of photos, etc. I wrote all the details here: http://www.theblackvault.com/casefiles/unknown-object-in-1960-photographs-from-mercury-redstone-1a/  (It will not copy and paste here, obviously, so I hope you all don't mind the link."

It is located on an island in the middle of Tere-Khol, a lake in Tuva.  The name Por-Bazhyng translates from the Tuvan language as ""earthenware house"".  The structure is believed to have been built sometime in the 8th century CE based upon the dating of several objects found in the ruin. According to Istvan Fodor of the National Museum in Hungary, identification of the structure's purpose is obscured because of the scant amount of evidence of daily human activity at the site.  The theories include a fortress, a palace, a monastery, and an astronomical observatory. It is possible, according to Dmitriy Subetto, from the Department of Physical Geography RGPU, that the structure was abandoned prior to completion due to the builders' lack of familiarity with permafrost.   Excavation of the site continues, and supervisor Tigran Mkrtich states that the structure was built around 757 AD.  Among objects found are clay tablets bearing imprints of human feet, and coloured drawings on the plaster of the palace.

Experts believe the 1300-year-old structure actually contains a summer palace and a monastery. But nobody has been able to prove it.  While the site was first explored in 1891, it wasn’t until 2007 that proper research took place, the Siberian Times reports. They discovered a distinctive Chinese influence — from the use of certain roof tiles to the building methods, further adding to the intrigue  The Por-Bajin Cultural Foundation, the official site for the complex, outlines some of the main questions that have yet to be answered: “Apparently, it was built at the period of the Uighur Khaganate (744-840). But it is not clear what did they build a fortress for in such a solitary place — far from big settlements and trade routes. “It is also unclear whether Por-Bajin was a defensive structure, a Buddhist or Manichaean temple or a summer residence of Khagan. There is even a version that there was an ancient observatory in it. The architecture of the fortress also produces many questions.  http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/por-bajin-the-mystery-hidden-in-siberia/story-e6frfqai-1227293552690"

The map is a result from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) study that astronomers hope will reveal more about the role that dark matter plays in the formation of new galaxies.  To create the map to the right, astronomers used one of the world's most powerful digital cameras perched on a mountain top in Chile (far away from any Earth-based interference) and scanned about two million galaxies. Dark matter is invisible but scientists can still ""see"" it and create maps like this by observing how its gravitational force bends light around galaxies."

UnexplainedPhotos,32df0o,flimspringfield,8,Tue Apr 14 04:42:50 2015 UTC,"Due to the deadly heat, scientists have been unable to come close enough to the crater to measure how deep it really is.  Located in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, near Urumqi, in northwest China, the sinkhole is 0.9 meters (3 feet) wide.  t is hot enough to light up branches and other objects placed next to it. Various tourist videos show people setting things on fire.   Locals have dubbed it a “gateway to hell.” Many have told the Chinese media that the ground in the area has been hot for some time now.  There is no volcanic activity in the region, which led scientists from the Xinjiang Meitian Geological Bureau to believe that the sinkhole was created out of coal seam spontaneously combusting.   The area was reportedly used for mining in the 1970s, China Central TV cited a supervisor from Xinjiang Meitian Fire Engineering Bureau, Chen Long, as saying, the Daily Mail reported."

UnexplainedPhotos,325cvy,WildTurkey81,27,Sat Apr 11 01:55:45 2015 UTC,"http://www.crystalinks.com/shc.html  Spontaneous human combustion is the alleged burning of a person's body without a readily apparent, identifiable external source of ignition. The combustion may result in simple burns and blisters to the skin, smoking, or a complete incineration of the body. The latter is the form most often recognized as SHC.  There is much speculation and controversy over SHC. It is not a proven natural occurrence, but many theories have attempted to explain SHC's existence and how it may occur. The two most common explanations offered to account for apparent SHC are the non-spontaneous ""wick effect"" fire, and the rare discharge called static flash fires. Although mathematically it can be shown that the human body contains enough energy stored in the form of fat and other tissues to consume it completely, in normal circumstances bodies will not sustain a flame on their own."

Bur seriously, well put together post but as has already been said, the majority of these are easily identified as hoaxes as the sound used is actually the noise made by the Walkers from the War of the Worlds movie remake. Pretty apt when you consider the whole original radio play being taken as real thing (which may be an urban myth but still).   The majority of people seemed to think they were the Trumpets of Jericho, the trumpeting of angels to herald the Christian apocalypse. Or aliens. But everything is something ""or aliens"" :P"

One or two of them were sounds taken from War of the Worlds, and the others used audio that had been taken by someone videotaping outside their apartment in a city while construction was going on. The tear down even points out one or two distinguishing sounds from the original audio that you can pick out in all the other videos. Search for ""strange noises explained"" or ""trumpet sound explained"" or something. Captain Disillusion may have even made a video on them."

Was about 3-4 years ago, very difficult to describe. The cloud ceiling was low that night in almost a foggy way, the sound came directly from above us.   Now, sure, it could have been a number of things, but where I live, there's no sound system that large, the two nearest places that have something that powerful are several (4-10) kilometers away. There are trains further back we can hear normally, but this wasn't a train, and didn't come from that direction. This was directly from above, a kilometer atleast or more in the air."

They used to call them frost quakes or air quakes. Don't think there's a reasonable explanation for them.  Link 6 is just a train, I hear one with the same exact multiple horns at once every night on the outskirts of Fort Hood.  There's also this one from the same day as the others, with bad acting.

UnexplainedPhotos,31egzl,autowikibot,1 point,Sun Apr 5 12:30:49 2015 UTC,"I know this is an old comment but I looked up the trumpet noise,because someone posted a video of one to FB today.  But I'm more interested in link 5 here, now that I've seen it. I just wanted to mention that I heard one of those loud booms last year. The funny thing was, I didn't really pay attention to it at the time. I lived practically right next door to Pensacola NAS and am used to loud noises as that's where the Blue Angels practice. But I wasn't paying attention to the fact that this boom was incredibly loud and happened at night- at least, I didn't think it was strange until I saw people from my hometown mentioning it and that was 60 or 70 miles from where I was. So something was that loud that it was heard at a high volume across a large area. Some research showed that it wasn't the first time either. It had happened a couple of years before and then a year or two before that. The news station called the air base who said they'd done nothing that might have made that, especially since it was at night and I never heard much aircraft at night, unless it was coast guard helicopters. It was just odd."

UnexplainedPhotos,31bqsm,Strixxi,23,Fri Apr 3 16:46:37 2015 UTC,"Downvoting aside, I see a lot of flak when it comes to posting on here. As in, when something is posted virtually every aspect of criticism is brought up. A good example is ""the situation is unexplained, but that photo is explainable"". I think I've even seen that said about the sidebar photo. To me, it's not about whether or not the specific photo is explainable but rather if there is a mysterious element.   Obviously, there are a limited number of truly unexplained photos out there, thus the discussion over r/unexplainedmedia. So we realistically need to be a bit more liberal with what gets posted, yet the trend is going in the opposite direction."
UnexplainedPhotos,31bqsm,AbideMan,16,Fri Apr 3 21:56:37 2015 UTC,"I see this a lot in niche subreddits. There is always a vocal minority who like to whinge incessantly about what does and does not belong in the sub, which is pretty ironic considering little enough content gets posted here as it is.  I have no problem with people debunking stuff that gets posted here (I do it myself), but the way I see it this should be place to discuss unexplained photos. Even if they can be debunked the post should be seen as an opportunity to discussion of the photo, including debunking or pointing out why it's a hoax or whatever rather than telling the OP ""this is a hoax, GTFO!"""
UnexplainedPhotos,31bqsm,_shazbot_,9,Fri Apr 3 22:24:58 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. Debunking is a great and vital part of the conversation. It's all about delivery though, you know?  I mean sure maybe some 15 year old is new to all the weirdness and they find something compelling that we all know is fake already.  That is NO REASON to treat this new member like some sort of a loser. Make the person feel welcome and explain to them the debunking in a helpful way, don't abuse the poor kid.   But I mean I can't really control how people react to other people either. Maybe those of us who are not annoyed with repeats just need to work harder on being supportive"

UnexplainedPhotos,30ykq3,blitzballer,2,Tue Mar 31 19:21:50 2015 UTC,"About 200 of the circular formations have been found near Turpan City in the northwestern part of the country, China Daily reported.  Although they had been known to locals, especially those from the nearby village of Lianmuqin, the formations were first discovered by archaeologists in 2003. Some began to dig under the stones to search for graves. China's CCTV reported that no graves have been found, and local government has stepped in to stop the digging to protect the sites.  Now one archaeologist has said he believes the circles were used for sacrifice.  ""Across Central Asia, these circles are normally sacrificial sites,"" Lyu Enguo, a local archaeologist who has done three studies at the circles, told CCTV.  Dr. Volker Heyd, an archaeologist at the University of Bristol, told MailOnline that similar circles in Mongolia were used in rituals.  ""Some might have served as surface marking of burial places,"" he was quoted as saying. ""Others, if not the majority, might denote holy places in the landscape, or places with special spiritual properties, or ritual offering/meeting places.""  Heyd estimated that some of the formations in China could be up to 4,500 years old."

University of Buenos Aires researchers found five German coins minted between 1938 and 1941 and a fragment of porcelain plate bearing the inscription Made in Germany.  “Apparently, halfway through the second world war, the Nazis had a secret project to build shelters for top leaders in the event of defeat – inaccessible sites in the middle of deserts, in the mountains, on a cliff or in the middle of the jungle like this,” the archaeologists’ team leader, Daniel Schavelzon, said."

UnexplainedPhotos,306hxq,idwthis,2,Wed Mar 25 00:20:12 2015 UTC,"It actually kind of does, seeing as how the man at the fore front of the picture is Adolf Eichmann. Here's the very first paragraph from the article that pic is attached to:    Before the war, Adolf Eichmann, born in 1906, was the acknowledged ""Jewish expert"" of the SS, in charge of carrying out various schemes to remove the Jews from Germany, such as encouraging – or forcing – them to emigrate, or transporting them to Madagascar. When the Germans invaded first Poland in 1939, then the Soviet Union two years later, Eichmann organised the concentration of the millions of Jews who lived in eastern Europe into ghettos, and then ensured they were taken, along with Jews from every part of Europe under Nazi control or influence, to camps such as Auschwitz, to be murdered. After Germany's defeat, Eichmann went underground and then escaped to Argentina, where he joined a number of other senior Nazis in exile, living under an assumed name. During the 1950s, however, his whereabouts were discovered, and, in 1960, he was kidnapped by Mossad agents and smuggled out to Jerusalem, where he was put on trial for mass murder, found guilty, and, in 1962, hanged.   So seeing as how he was a freaking Nazi, the thumbnail does in fact go along with the article."

The Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System is the largest solar plant in the world and makes the towers light up bright white when collecting energy.  It is located pretty much on a straight line path between Phoenix and San Francisco.  It would be very visible if lit up out of the right side of the airplane."

They speculate that it could be malformed, or a hybrid of a blue whale and another species. The research team has been contacted by deaf people who believe the whale may be deaf.  Whatever biological cause underlies its unusually high voice does not seem to be detrimental to its survival. The fact that the whale has survived and apparently matured indicates it is probably healthy. Still, its unique call is the only one of its kind detected anywhere and there is only one such source per season. Because of this, the animal has been called the loneliest whale in the world"

The trail is not very accessible and there is/was a guard near the ""entrance"" as well as many people in the surrounding neighborhood who frown upon using it. To bypass the guard you have to start the hike before 5 am.... So to me its a little more creepy to think about thus young man by himself very early in the morning running into someone on this trail and then disappearing.      Ps. Always let people know where you are going and when you should be back when going on excursions like this...and for this one he really should not have been alone."

UnexplainedPhotos,2yqrzi,Troyus_Maximus,-13,Thu Mar 12 04:00:33 2015 UTC,That's happened to me before too. I think I once heard that it's just the phone lines crossing. Calls were intercepted with each other. But definitely still freaky.

But I kid you not there were over 100 photos on this phone of the weirdest stuff, its almost like someone either a soldier or a civilian living in the middle east had had that phone already and took a bunch of pictures. There were pictures of troops, of what looked like land mines or other types of explosives, of middle eastern citizens going about their normal life, of cars, of an airport and planes, and just other ever day stuff except with soldiers and of the middle east. Now it was my first Iphone and I had just gotten it so I didnt want to take it back so I ended up showing a bunch of friends the photos because I wanted some witnesses that I wasnt a terrorist or something and then deleted all of them. The only plausible explanation I have for why I got those photos is when they plugged it into the information transfer machine thing they use in the stores someone elses data was still on there and got loaded onto the phone with my stuff."

UnexplainedPhotos,2ye565,samw3d,20,Sun Mar 15 06:06:50 2015 UTC,"Old Mike is the name given to a traveling salesman who died in 1911 in Prescott (Nevada County). The people of Prescott only knew him by his first name, Mike. He was subsequently embalmed and publicly displayed for over sixty years.  Mike visited Prescott about once a month to sell pens, paper, and thread to homes and businesses near the railroad tracks in the center of town. He would arrive on the southbound 3:00 p.m. train and stay overnight. The next day, he would re-board the 3:00 p.m. train and continue his journey.  On April 11, 1911, Mike probably attended an outdoor revival in the city park. The next day, his body was found underneath a tree in the park, where he had apparently died of a heart attack or stroke.  The body was taken to the Cornish Funeral Home, where it was embalmed. A search of Mike’s belongings did not turn up any identification. What was known about Mike was that he was forty to forty-five years old; spoke English with little accent; was probably Italian; had suffered some type of injury to his right arm and left leg, possibly the effects of a stroke; and had had very elaborate dental work done. The body was placed on display at the funeral home in hopes of someone identifying it. No one came forward to identify or claim the body.  As the years passed, it became more and more unlikely that Mike would ever be identified. The body turned into somewhat of a tourist attraction, and people traveled from surrounding areas to view the remains.  In 1975, the Arkansas Attorney General’s Office asked Cornish Funeral Home to bury the body. On May 12, 1975, a quiet ceremony was held at the DeAnn Cemetery, and Old Mike was put to rest.  http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=4924#  http://www.depotmuseum.org/articles.php?article=25"

The 150-pound fossil recovered in northern Kentucky is more than 6 feet long and 3 feet wide. To the untrained eye, it looks like a bunch of rocks or a concrete blob. Experts are trying to determine whether it was an animal, mineral or a form of plant life from a time when the Cincinnati region was underwater.  Scientists at a Geological Society of America meeting viewed it at the Dayton Convention Center in Ohio.  ""We are looking for people who might have an idea of what it is,"" said Ben Dattilo, an assistant professor of geology at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne.  Scientists say the fossil is 450 million years old. University of Cincinnati geologist Carl Brett said it's the largest fossil ever extracted from that era in the Cincinnati region.

UnexplainedPhotos,2y3q9i,jayman419,7,Fri Mar 6 18:41:35 2015 UTC,"That was my opinion looking at it. And that fits, because it's obviously got some kind of branching structure that would seem to be very similar to the stalks on a cactus like this.  But there are two reasons why they think it could be an unusual animal. First, it doesn't have the typical ""leaf"" structure of a cactus.  But obviously 450 million years ago tiny thorns may have been useless or simply not evolved yet. They also say it seems more primitive than the time frame they found it in, those layers should have been from a more advanced era. But that's the researchers simply speculating.  Second, it's the first of its kind ever found. Soft-bodied organisms are rarely preserved, while plants tend to be better represented in the fossil record. It's from an area that's a favorite of paleontologists, particularly amateur fossil hunters (like the guy who found this), an area that's been studied for more than 200 years. So if it was a common plant in the timeframe and region, it should have been discovered before now.  Here's a pretty good article about it, whatever it is.  edit: Fixed the second link."

The young girl and boy had green-hued skin and spoke an unknown language. The children became sick and the boy died, but the girl recovered and over the years came to learn English. She later relayed the story of their origins, saying they came from a place called St Martin’s Land, which existed in an atmosphere of permanent twilight, and where the people lived underground.  While some view the story as a folk tale that that describes an imaginary  encounter with inhabitants of another world beneath our feet or even extraterrestrial, others accept it as a real, but somewhat altered account of a historical event that merits further investigation. http://www.ancient-origins.net/unexplained-phenomena/green-children-woolpit-12th-century-legend-visitors-another-world-002347"
UnexplainedPhotos,2y1sp2,hablomuchoingles,53,Thu Mar 5 18:54:09 2015 UTC,"Most Plausible explanation:   Many Flemish immigrants arrived in eastern England during the 12th century, and they were persecuted after Henry II became king in 1154; a large number of them were killed near Bury St Edmunds in 1173 at the Battle of Fornham fought between Henry II and Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester. Paul Harris has suggested that the green children's Flemish parents perished during a period of civil strife and that the children may have come from the village of Fornham St Martin, slightly to the north of Bury St Edmunds, where a settlement of Flemish fullers existed at that time. They may have fled and ultimately wandered to Woolpit. Disoriented, bewildered, and dressed in unfamiliar Flemish clothes, the children would have presented a very strange spectacle to the Woolpit villagers. The children's colour could be explained by green sickness, the result of a dietary deficiency. Brian Haughton considers Harris's explanation to be plausible, and the one most widely accepted, although not without its difficulties. For instance, he suggests it is unlikely that an educated local man like Richard de Calne would not have recognized the language spoken by the children as being Flemish."

An image in relief from the time shows the couple standing over their daughter’s body in mourning. Shortly after this, Nefertiti vanishes from the historical record. There have been many theories offered to explain her abrupt disappearance and, among these are:   She fell out of favor with her husband because she could not produce a male heir and so was replaced by Kiya. She abandoned the religion of Aten and was banished by Akhenaten. She committed suicide in grief over the loss of her daughter.

A robot has sent back the first images of markings on the wall of a tiny chamber in the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt that have not been seen for 4500 years. It has also helped settle the controversy about the only metal known to exist in the pyramid, and shows a ""door"" that could lead to another hidden chamber.  The pyramid is thought to have been built as a tomb for the pharaoh Khufu, and is the last of the seven wonders of the ancient world still standing. It contains three main chambers: the Queen's Chamber, the Grand Gallery and the King's Chamber, which has two air shafts connecting it with the outside world. Strangely, though, there are two tunnels, about 20 centimetres by 20 centimetres, that extend from the north and south walls of the Queen's Chamber and stop at stone doors before they reach the outside of the pyramid (see diagram).  The function of these tunnels and doors is unknown, but some believe that one or both could lead to a secret chamber. Zahi Hawass, Egypt's Minister of State for Antiquities Affairs, describes the doors as the last great mystery of the pyramid.  Several attempts have been made to explore the tunnels using robots. In 1993, a robot crawled some 63 metres up the tunnel in the south wall and discovered what appeared to be a small stone door set with metal pins. Metal is not part of any other known structure in the pyramid, and the discovery ignited speculation that the pins were door handles, keys or even parts of a power supply constructed by aliens.  Then in 2002 another robot drilled through the stone block and filmed a small chamber backed by a large blocking stone, but little else. Now a robot designed by engineer Rob Richardson from the University of Leeds, UK, and colleagues, and named Djedi after the magician that Khufu consulted when he planned his tomb, has crawled up the tunnel carrying a bendy ""micro snake"" camera that can see around corners.  Images sent back by the camera have revealed hieroglyphs written in red paint and lines in the stone that could be marks left by stone masons when the chamber was being carved (Annales Du Service des Antiquités De L'Égypte, vol 84, ISBN: 978-977-704-184-3).

In 1993, a robot crawled some 63 metres up the tunnel in the south wall and discovered what appeared to be a small stone door set with metal pins. Metal is not part of any other known structure in the pyramid, and the discovery ignited speculation that the pins were door handles, keys or even parts of a power supply constructed by aliens.   So hilarious to logically jump from door handles to alien power supplies.  Also, I don't see any photos?"

UnexplainedPhotos,2xuo9h,blitzballer,11,Wed Mar 4 00:40:49 2015 UTC,"Archaeologists surveyed and mapped extensive plazas, earthworks, mounds, and an earthen pyramid belonging to a culture that thrived a thousand years ago, and then vanished. The team, which returned from the site last Wednesday, also discovered a remarkable cache of stone sculptures that had lain untouched since the city was abandoned.  In contrast to the nearby Maya, this vanished culture has been scarcely studied and it remains virtually unknown. Archaeologists don’t even have a name for it.  Christopher Fisher, a Mesoamerican archaeologist on the team from Colorado State University, said the pristine, unlooted condition of the site was “incredibly rare.” He speculated that the cache, found at the base of the pyramid, may have been an offering.  “The undisturbed context is unique,” Fisher said. “This is a powerful ritual display, to take wealth objects like this out of circulation.”  The tops of 52 artifacts were peeking from the earth. Many more evidently lie below ground, with possible burials. They include stone ceremonial seats (called metates) and finely carved vessels decorated with snakes, zoomorphic figures, and vultures.  The most striking object emerging from the ground is the head of what Fisher speculated might be “a were-jaguar,” possibly depicting a shaman in a transformed, spirit state. Alternatively, the artifact might be related to ritualized ball games that were a feature of pre-Columbian life in Mesoamerica.  “The figure seems to be wearing a helmet,” said Fisher. Team member Oscar Neil Cruz, head archaeologist at the Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History (IHAH), believes the artifacts date to A.D. 1000 to 1400.  The objects were documented but left unexcavated. To protect the site from looters, its location is not being revealed."

UnexplainedPhotos,2w3ykr,ishkabibbles84,2,Tue Feb 17 18:16:25 2015 UTC,and this pic is a real stretch
UnexplainedPhotos,2w3ykr,iHike29,2,Tue Mar 3 23:20:02 2015 UTC,Amen. Even a very far fetched explanation is more likely than an actual picture of a ghost or UFO.
UnexplainedPhotos,2w3ykr,tendorphin,5,Tue Feb 17 02:27:33 2015 UTC,Looks to me like a bug probably not on the lens but flying nearby. Lens is focused on the background so the nearby tiny bug is blurry and small enough to not be seen by the photographer.
UnexplainedPhotos,2w3ykr,JustVan,3,Tue Feb 17 00:20:37 2015 UTC,"There are numerous photographs and accounts with similar unexplained 'objects', some of which are clearer than here and definitely do resemble what is commonly associated with an unidentified flying object, where the photographer states not seeing anything of a larger visible scale object being present at the time. The suggestion being that the objects might have been flying at a speed faster than the eye and brain can process and notice visibly, but which the split second action of the camera is able to record.  Not saying I think this case is identifiable unreservedly as a UFO, it may indeed be a bug or dirt. I don't really know either way, personally. Just saying that these 'objects' could be more or less invisible at times to the naked eye, in terms of relative speed..  Presumably the 'author' of said photo has considered all possibilities within the range of 'rational' and reasonable explanations to their own satisfaction otherwise I guess they wouldn't have gone public with it, nor sought media attention (for they would become the butt of jokes amongst wider friends and community). We're not able to view the original image nor analyse it easily on a larger scale, only being provided with the media-ated image here.."
UnexplainedPhotos,2w3ykr,tendorphin,3,Wed Feb 18 20:24:10 2015 UTC,"You're correct; you made a lot of great points, except that it is actually a myth that something, apart from something very tiny or something large but very far away, could move so quickly as to become invisible. It may become blurry, but if it is at least human sized or greater, it will not become invisible. it is a physical and (assuming functioning visual/neurological systems) biological impossibility. Unfortunately this is the best source I can provide, but it is true. I can't quite do the math portion of it, but the concepts are solid and I find no fault in them (physics and psychology background).   What I can believe is that it was a small detail they didn't see, or something they weren't paying attention to. Inattentional blindness is a very common phenomenon. If you youtube videos about it, such as the classic selective attention video. Be warned that it may not work if you have any inkling of what the phenomenon is about in mind when you watch it, but it is something that the vast majority of people on earth experience many times daily - otherwise we'd constantly be under information overload. As well, memory is incredibly fallible. Suggestibility is very powerful, and there's nothing stopping the person being suggested to also being the person the suggestion is coming from. Suggestibility is so powerful that a recent study showed that participants in a study were actually convinced to believe that they committed a crime when in reality they never did, and the majority of participants were convinced. Some of the crimes the participants were convinced of even went as far as assault with a deadly weapon! They even created more memories surrounding the events, such as what family and police reactions were, completely without any priming stimulus. So, when a person takes a picture and sees something in the picture that they don't remember, their mind can easily confabulate a story, even an unlikely one, to make up for this apparent missing information in the face of unfamiliar stimuli. I won't even bother to explain retro and proactive interference or how horrible eyewitness testimony is (that link requires you to download a video, but it's legit, and may I be banned if it is not, and it's a good way to show eyewitness shortcoming - if you'd rather, here's a plain article).   I know I've belabored the point even beyond what this case requires to look at, but that's just to show the many problems with just taking the witnesses' word for what they're claiming.  On a less scientific note, any picture whose source is, ""the photographer doesn't recall seeing this [person/object/entity] when they took the picture!"" is immediately dismissable, IMO. It is even somewhat irresponsible to allow such pictures into the grander collection of evidence, because there are just so many other things that could explain the photo away, that even the photographer isn't aware of."
UnexplainedPhotos,2w3ykr,Tbexton2182,1 point,Thu Feb 19 00:23:47 2015 UTC,"At first I was in disagreement with you, things traveling at an extremely high rate of speed that you currently did not hear can go unnoticed, but you explained yourself and I see where you were coming from. Yet in the end I think you were wrong. Yes, eye witness testimony is highly influential on the individuals mind, but if you rule out that when you have a photo as well how are you to get proof of anything? I mean besides physical evidence (which in this case is impossible). so IMO Inattentional blindness took place while the individual was focused on taking photos, they didn't notice the blur since they were just snapping away enjoy the scenery, and they happened to capture an image of something that baffles them."
UnexplainedPhotos,2w3ykr,tendorphin,1 point,Wed Feb 25 08:04:16 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right. While I personally dismiss these bits of evidence, it is not entirely because I don't believe them, it is that they are all circumstantial. In the larger collection of evidences we have, these photos provide nothing. A skeptic can wave them away, and a believer would be hard pressed to provide anything besides hearsay to help bring that photo back into the larger discussion at hand. For personal conversation or favorite pictures, it is fine. Even a personal level of evidence to help support your own faith in the paranormal is fine, but we cannot use these to sway those who do not believe that there may be something out there, whether it be ghosts, aliens, cryptids, etc.   So, to rephrase in a more concise way, allowing these into the record of evidence is only making the rest of it less credible, due to how flimsy the stories are behind these types of pictures."

The shadowy figure, dressed in black with a wide-brimmed hat and white scarf, would pour himself a glass of cognac and raise a toast to Poe's memory, then vanish into the night, leaving three roses in a distinctive arrangement and the unfinished bottle of cognac. Onlookers gathered annually in hopes of glimpsing the elusive Toaster, who did not seek publicity and was rarely seen or photographed.

UnexplainedPhotos,2vser1,TaedW,6,Fri Feb 13 18:36:59 2015 UTC,"The board walk crosses the Firehole river and goes off to the left. However, up to the right is a nice walk up a small hill, something that skiiers and snowshoers would do.

UnexplainedPhotos,2vser1,trismagestus,2,Sat Feb 14 06:10:22 2015 UTC,I saw that! And did you notice all of the skiiers in their black outfits? I am sure the boardwalk has snow on it like the snow on the walkway in the Old Faithful webcam.
UnexplainedPhotos,2vser1,beagal,2,Fri Feb 13 19:04:44 2015 UTC,Im not saying one way or the other that it is/ isn't bigfoot.  But the video by ThinkerThunker makes some good points about the size of whatever it is we are seeing.
UnexplainedPhotos,2vser1,ham_sandwich27,10,Fri Feb 13 18:40:30 2015 UTC,"Look at the area on Google Maps.  The camera is at the Old Faithful Visitor Center to the South of the Old Faithful Geyser and it is looking north.  Based on the bridge and fences, it is easy to see where everything is on the aerial view.  The ""creatures"" are clearly on one of the many walking paths in the area, and I measured them to be about 300 feet away from the bison.  The walking path winds around, and is also where the ""creatures"" (which you assume to be the same creatures) first appear.  What you can't see on that video is that the ""creatures"" and the bison are only 700 feet away from the huge Old Faithful Lodge (which would room about 1,200 people) which would be to the right of the camera.  To the left of the camera would be the Old Faithful Inn, which would hold about 1,500 people.  So, with all those people around in the winter, I think we can infer that many of them would be walking, cross-country skiing, and perhaps snowshoeing on the paths.  I think that if there had been some large ""bigfoot"" creatures nearby, they would have been noticed by all the other people on the same trail.  And it's also currently winter, so on a snowy day, you might look at the NPS webcam, get lucky when they zoom, and see all those people in the same area and you can judge for yourself.﻿"

UnexplainedPhotos,2vq2jm,softerr--,9,Fri Feb 13 13:19:39 2015 UTC,A possible clue rests on the island. Moorman's jawbone had been buried with an unbound stack of papers 3/4 inches by 3/4 inches alternated by slips of tin foil material between the pages. The cryptic papers may be part of a Chinese burial ritual representing money and fortune in the next life. Gold and silver foil such as the ones inside the papers also represent money or good fortune for the dead to bring with them into the next life.   Wow. That is a bit creepy and really very sad. This really is a good one.

UnexplainedPhotos,2vq2jm,bionicjess,4,Fri Feb 13 11:32:43 2015 UTC,"Last summer me and my brother went night fishing at a lake where we own a little spot for the summers.  There were some young yahoos down where we usually park our boat, just being drunk teenagers.  Long story short, we came back and took an hour break.  Pulled our little 9"" bass boat up onto the shore but didn't tie it up (because it was a very small lot, everybody knew everyone else).  Came back an hour later and it was gone.  We knew that the kids took it out into the cove then jumped out and swam back.  Spent the next few hours riding around the lake until we found it (pure dumb luck, by the way).    But I just remember how freaked out somebody would have been had they accidentally came across it in the middle of the night floating int the lake, with no one in it."

UnexplainedPhotos,2vq2jm,SwillFish,4,Fri Feb 13 16:06:32 2015 UTC,"I own a somewhat similar fishing boat just a foot shorter than that Whaler. Five guys in a boat that size is definitely pushing maximum load capacity. Whalers are foamed filled and are famous for being impossible to sink. In all likelyhood the boat got swamped and eventually all but one of the five got separated from the half sunk boat. He likely died in the boat, which would have been like a floating bathtub, and then by some miracle his body stayed with it on its 2,000 mile journey. Perhaps he tied himself in before he died? The article speculates that the Whaler and his body were eventually found by some Chinese fisherman who couldn't report their find because they were illegally fishing. They did the next best thing and gave him a proper burial."
UnexplainedPhotos,2vq2jm,Feligris,1 point,Sat Feb 14 05:04:43 2015 UTC,"And even if they weren't exactly illegally fishing, they might have been afraid of being targeted for investigation and perhaps given jail time themselves as suspects if they reported their findings to the Chinese authorities.

UnexplainedPhotos,2vnxm9,SwillFish,0,Sat Feb 14 05:34:16 2015 UTC,"Concretion:        For other uses, see Calculus (medicine), enterolith and nodule (geology).   A concretion is a hard, compact mass of matter formed by the precipitation of mineral cement within the spaces between particles, and is found in sedimentary rock or soil.  Concretions are often ovoid or spherical in shape, although irregular shapes also occur. The word 'concretion' is derived from the Latin con meaning 'together' and crescere meaning 'to grow'. Concretions form within layers of sedimentary strata that have already been deposited. They usually form early in the burial history of the sediment, before the rest of the sediment is hardened into rock. This concretionary cement often makes the concretion harder and more resistant to weathering than the host stratum.  There is an important distinction to draw between concretions and nodules. Concretions are formed from mineral precipitation around some kind of nucleus while a nodule is a replacement body.

UnexplainedPhotos,2vj4xa,egzon27,21,Wed Feb 11 23:47:23 2015 UTC,It's literally the only circle in the image. The big round thing in the middle of your screen.

UnexplainedPhotos,2vj4xa,Troyus_Maximus,20,Thu Feb 12 07:11:19 2015 UTC,I couldn't find anything definite with a quick googling but I would suspect that they may be some kind of Bora Ring or something similar. An Aboriginal ceremonial ground.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bora_%28Australian%29
UnexplainedPhotos,2vj4xa,ShaneO_85,8,Thu Feb 12 02:21:32 2015 UTC,"Bora (Australian):       A Bora is the name both to an initiation ceremony of Indigenous Australians, and to the site on which the initiation is performed. At such a site, boys achieve the status of men. The initiation ceremony differs from culture to culture, but often involves scarification and may also involve the removal of a tooth or part of a finger. The ceremony, and the process leading up to it, involves the learning of sacred songs, stories, dances, and traditional lore. Many different clans will assemble to participate in an initiation ceremony.    Image i - Photograph of a Bora ceremony, taken in 1898 by Charles Kerry.

UnexplainedPhotos,2vj4xa,autowikibot,15,Wed Feb 11 17:08:51 2015 UTC,"The location in relation to the rest of Australia.  Keep in mind this was about 4 years ago so I'm probably not remembering all the details right.  I remember driving past here and looking out the window to see what looked like a wall of rocks. I had just visited a place called Lasseter's Cave. When I got back home, I was looking on Google Earth to see where I had gone and noticed this. It just so happens to also be almost exactly or exactly 60 metres in diameter. I measured the diameter using Google Earth, and I got 59.95m across, but of course it was only roughly that. Either way, it's a pretty big coincidence if it just so happens to be almost exactly 60 metres across."
UnexplainedPhotos,2vj4xa,Moikee,10,Wed Feb 11 17:09:21 2015 UTC,"After zooming out a bit to see if there was anything similar, it made me realise just how remote that location is and how horrible it would be to get stuck there (car breaking down etc)."

UnexplainedPhotos,2vj4xa,Moikee,4,Thu Feb 12 00:09:53 2015 UTC,"People die out there regularly. Mostly unprepared tourists that underestimate just how bad it is but even experienced, well prepared people have died out there."
UnexplainedPhotos,2vj4xa,GoroTheBastard,2,Thu Feb 12 01:32:52 2015 UTC,That's absolutely terrifying. And I guess there's nothing you can do besides tell people to always be prepared for such an event.
UnexplainedPhotos,2vj4xa,rarebit13,3,Thu Feb 12 07:50:19 2015 UTC,"You can be prepared as best you can but sometimes it's not enough. I'm from a remote area 550kms from the nearest city, well over 1000kms to the next. It's usually a stop over for travellers so of course we get all the missing persons notices. I believe there are 3 reports at the moment, but it's been weeks so I'm sure they are long gone. There are local deaths very often too, despite everyone being more than aware of how quickly things can go bad. It's a popular suicide method too, people walk off as far as they can and shoot themselves (or whatever method they choose) knowing it's unlikely their families will find them."
UnexplainedPhotos,2vj4xa,rarebit13,3,Thu Feb 12 09:40:40 2015 UTC,"How tall were the rocks?  I used to live in an aboriginal community about 160km further north west of there (about 4hrs driving if memory serves me right) about 20 years ago. We'd have to drive out on that road to get back to civilization, and I can't ever remember seeing it back then.  Anyhow, camels and goats are common out there.  Could it be possible it is a holding pen for either?  Probably a more important question would be, did you ever find Lasseters Reef?"
UnexplainedPhotos,2vj4xa,rarebit13,5,Mon Feb 23 04:38:34 2015 UTC,"It was a while ago (more than 4 years) so I'm probably misremembering, but they were a bit taller than a man, so about 2, 2.5 metres.  And no, I didn't find the reef :P"

She moved to another community a few years back (I didn't realise) and can't remember it from when she was there.  So no luck from me, sorry.   I just thought of someone else that I know lived out bush there for a while, they've likely driven past it in the last few years.  I'll get in touch with them and see...."

UnexplainedPhotos,2vj4xa,Citrusface,2,Thu Feb 12 12:18:07 2015 UTC,No luck from my other contact. Sorry.  Those stone must be pretty recent (within the past 10 yes). I'd hazard a guess that they are either something made out of boredom or as an art project. Doubtful it has any cultural significance as those sorts of circles are more eastern Australia than central/western Australia.

UnexplainedPhotos,2vj4xa,MexicanPimp,15,Thu Feb 12 02:22:04 2015 UTC,What's wrong with making big rings with rocks in the middle of nowhere? I for one suggest it is serious. Humans have a proud history of carrying huge rocks vast distances for very little reason. It joins us all together and sets us apart from the other species. I am proud of my heritage and will carry on our long held tradition of making pointless shapes with rocks in the middle of nowhere.
UnexplainedPhotos,2vj4xa,_angesaurus,8,Wed Feb 11 22:18:23 2015 UTC,"Someone put a lot of time into making that ring of rocks. It's almost a perfect circle, some jackass wouldn't put that much care into it."

The carving, which was very dirty, may have been plowed up many years ago, Balme said. Despite the carving's poor shape, he thought it was no ordinary ornament; so he purchased it and carefully cleaned it.  When he was done conserving it, Balme saw a stone carving with an extremely complex pattern that is difficult to describe. It's possible the ""pattern carved may be some form of writing,"" Balme told Live Science in an email. The carving's use is unknown, though it could be ""a keystone from an archway or indeed a vaulted ceiling,"" Balme said  more;  http://www.livescience.com/49721-mysterious-stone-carving-discovered.html"

UnexplainedPhotos,2vhm5q,prisonmike-,13,Wed Feb 11 14:11:19 2015 UTC,It's pretty funny how most unexplained photos are taken with horrible quality so you can't actually make out anything in the picture.

UnexplainedPhotos,2vfieg,nimbusstev,2,Tue Feb 10 21:47:23 2015 UTC,"I agree with the below posters - seems fishy that these ""alien photos"" always seem to be very grainy, far-off shots that are out of focus."
UnexplainedPhotos,2vfieg,Baloncesto,3,Wed Feb 11 15:49:59 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair, if you were alone in the woods at night and ran into something that looked like that, would you get up right next to it and take the time to get a clear shot?  But yeah, these ""alien shots"" are always really suspicious."
UnexplainedPhotos,2vfieg,The_Real_Art,0,Thu Feb 12 01:05:52 2015 UTC,"Well, according to the source background, the guy who took the photo DID chase the thing. Certainly, if I had seen it, and had the prescience to take a photo, I'd chase it!  I suppose my point is that the majority of these photos - aliens, mysterious figures, etc, all seem to be very low-res, blurry, and taken hastily. And so it's really hard to take them (and anything on this sub) seriously. We should disallow any super-grainy, poor resolution photos since they really could be anything and thus unworthy of our attention."

UnexplainedPhotos,2vfieg,Level100ProtWarrior,4,Wed Feb 11 17:33:51 2015 UTC,"Because even things as simple as having a discreet head/face and four limbs are  due to our very specific genetic lineage. For aliens to be remotely humanoid they would have to develop very, very similarly to us. For example, the only reason that we have a head, four limbs, etc, is that we are evolved from fish."

UnexplainedPhotos,2vfieg,The_Real_Art,1 point,Thu Feb 26 06:43:17 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah. If a setting has aliens that are humanoid, the default answer is either the author didn't think of it, or we're somehow related."
UnexplainedPhotos,2vfieg,The_Real_Art,-1,Thu Feb 26 15:26:00 2015 UTC,"I think you are supporting my theory. There is a reason there is such excitement in the  scientific community when an ""earth like"" planet is found. Being earth like would have all the same qualities and features of a planet we experience here. So, if life were to bud on this ""earth like"" planet, chances are it's in the same way. And if we are to buy into the theory of evolution (why do they still call it a ""theory?"") then chances are you would be human like.   I produced and directed a documentary on The History Channel called The Universe: Alien Faces and it talked about how life would form in different ways on different planets with different environments. You might find it interesting because we focused on different worlds than our own - but a planet similar to earth would produce similar results."
UnexplainedPhotos,2vfieg,The_Real_Art,2,Thu Feb 12 00:36:11 2015 UTC,Eh... There's so much random chance in evolution that we'd probably look nothing like other earthlike denizens.

But let all that aside. If it were a tattoo based off of a Jerry Garcia Guitar, how does that link the band to the killing? My buddy has the Led Zeppelin Zoso on his arm. If he is killed do I need to contact the bands publicist for comment.

To the Oklahoma police, it was easy to file it as an accident, an open-and-shut case.  But because Silkwood had been collecting allegations about the health and safety conditions at the Kerr-McGee plant, where she worked, for several months, because she had just been so seriously contaminated herself that her home had been stripped of all possessions due to the radiation exposure, and because at the time of the crash she had been on her way to meet a reporter from The New York Times, allegedly armed with a manila envelope stuffed with evidence of corporate misconduct, the official conclusion was doubted by everyone who knew Silkwood personally."

UnexplainedPhotos,2uuecv,doritosandhappiness,1 point,Tue Feb 10 16:03:49 2015 UTC,"Rendlesham Forest incident:       In late December 1980, there were reports of sightings of unexplained lights near Rendlesham Forest, Suffolk, England, and claimed landings of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The incident is sometimes called the most famous UFO event to have happened in Britain  ""Britain's Roswell"",  and like the Roswell UFO incident, the government's statement that there is no evidence of a UFO has been incorporated into conspiracy theories about a government coverup.  At that time, RAF Woodbridge was being used by the U.S. Air Force and over a two- or three-day period, dozens of USAF personnel were involved. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) stated the event posed no threat to national security, and that it therefore never was investigated as a security matter. Later evidence indicated that there was a substantial MoD file on the subject, which led to claims of a cover-up; some interpreted this as part of a larger pattern of information suppression concerning the true nature of unidentified flying objects, by both the United States and British governments. One person to take this view was Deputy Base Commander Colonel Charles Halt. Another was former NATO head and UK Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Peter Hill-Norton, who stated whatever happened at this USAF base was necessarily of national security interest. However, when the file was released in 2001 it turned out to consist mostly of internal correspondence and responses to inquiries from the public. The lack of any in-depth investigation in the publicly released documents is consistent with the MoD's earlier statement that they never took the case seriously.   Included in the released files is an explanation given by defence minister Lord Trefgarne as to why the MoD did not investigate further.  The sightings have been explained as misinterpretation of a series of nocturnal lights – a fireball, the Orford Ness lighthouse and bright stars.

The 1991 Abbeville edition features a couple having sex and being transformed into a crocodile. Shakespeare described sex as the ""beast with two backs"" but Serafini is operating on a different level to the Bard. The 1993 edition uses a different image for its cover - a man in very unpractical headwear appears to be riding a llama, which has an impressive set of antlers. They are both staring into a mirror outside a stone building that appears to be offering some sort of brightly colored food. Both covers are strange but the crocodile sex image is more disturbing.  Essentially an encyclopedia about an alien world that clearly reflects our own, each chapter appears to deal with key facets of this surreal place, including flora, fauna, science, machines, games and architecture. It's difficult to be exact because no-one has ever understood the contents page. Elements of today's world are visible but they are nearly always given some surreal twist - floating flowers, a peeled banana containing pills, a strange car covered in flies, clothing that would seem strange even in the 1970s, a man wearing roller-skates - with a fountain pen's nib instead of a hand - stabbed through the chest with a pen, and lots of biped creatures with human legs attached to all manner of crazy things.

""This project has revealed that the area around Stonehenge is teeming with previously unseen archaeology.""  The survey was completed as part of the Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project, a collaboration between the University of Birmingham and the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological Prospection and Virtual Archaeology.  Over the course of four years, researchers used remote sensing techniques and geophysical surveys to collect data from the 12-square-kilometer area surrounding Stonehenge. Up to 17 structures were unexpectedly discovered in close proximity to the stone monument.  Gaffney said before this project, the closest known structure to Stonehenge was more than 1.5 miles away. Some of the recently discovered structures are as close as 150 feet from Stonehenge.  ""We can interpret the structures in a sense as small shrines or chapels — Stonehenge being like the cathedral, in relative terms,"" Gaffney told Mashable. ""Suddenly, we are looking at a landscape with lots of small shrines, suggesting the area was full of activity, and Stonehenge becomes a different monument.""  The researchers believe the new findings are related to rituals and processional routes that culminated at the main structure of Stonehenge. Dozens of burial mounds in the area were also mapped in meticulous detail. One mound discovered was identified as a long barrow, a massive timber building used as a center for elaborate burial rituals that involved exposure and the removal of flesh and organs.  http://mashable.com/2014/09/11/stonehenge-underground-map-discovery/"
UnexplainedPhotos,2u542j,DeaditeQueen,10,Fri Jan 30 00:18:09 2015 UTC,"Now I've always agreed with the popular Druidic Life Cycle theory. Some experts in Druidic religion state that Stonehenge was built to represent ""death"" and every year a few miles away (and there is archeological evidence to back this up) an identical structure was built with wood for certain festivities and rituals. Wood representing that life is temporary. The inevitability and permanence of death was represented during these festivities and rituals by the stone version. The calendar that can be followed using Stonehenge marks out several dates thought to be very important to particular sects of Druidic religion and that also happen to be centered around the concepts of life and death.  The first book I read on the theory (I'm struggling to recall its name. I'll have a look thru my collection later and try to update) stated that academic supporters of this idea believe(d) that this type of discovery about the vastness of Stonehenge was inevitable. The book (about 20-ish years old) goes into some detail theorizing what other kinds of structures may have surrounded Stonehenge (and would have had identical partners represented at ""Woodhenge"") and what they would have represented. The theories are based on academic knowledge of how the oldest known forms of the religion were practiced, other Druidic sights and ancient texts. Now that this has come to light I'll surely be rereading to see if any of their theories hit the mark!"

It also released a grainy photograph showing an object in the sea near Stockholm, although it was not clear what the object was.  The Swedish navy has asked all vessels to stay at least 10km away from military vessels.  A Swedish official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the BBC that air space around the search area had been closed off.  He said he doubted the incident could have been a navigating error, as the Stockholm archipelago is a difficult area to navigate.  When asked why an underwater vessel would have entered waters off Sweden, the official said: ""It's always about testing the Swedish response to see if we are awake and able to detect it... it's a way of testing our skills in detecting and locating.""  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29686756  http://mashable.com/2014/10/20/sweden-submarine-search/"

A nice summary of where the story stands right now can be found at the imgur link.    In 1995, an unidentified young man, presumed to be a hitchhiker, was killed in a car accident that also took the life of the driver. The unidentified young man had no identification on him. He was wearing a Grateful Dead shirt and a note addressed to Jason was found near his body. Therefore he has been referred to as both Grateful Doe and Jason Doe.   The case has remained pretty cold for almost twenty years. However, recently redditor /u/greymetal posted an image on imgur asking for help identifying Grateful Doe.   An imgur user replied that he lost contact with a young man named Jason around that same time. Jason was a Grateful Dead fan and the photos provided by the imgur user bear a striking resemblance to Grateful Doe.    Unfortunately, the imgur user could not remember Jason's last name.  Right now, we are looking for anyone who might be able to identify Jason so that we can establish whether or not he is Grateful Doe.   I know that it is a long shot but this the best lead in years and we may be very close to finally giving Grateful Doe his identity back."

UnexplainedPhotos,2portl,Nowritesincehschool,45,Thu Dec 18 15:08:20 2014 UTC,"Used to live not far from here. A decade or so ago some people decided to investigate the source of the light. They discovered that whenever a vehicle was travelling on a highway on the other end of the trees, it's headlights could be seen from the other side. From this distance the headlights appeared as one single light. In order to prove this point, they parked a car on said highway and told the driver via walkie-talkie to flash their brights. When the driver did so, this ""ghost light"" would suddenly flash brighter. This led them to believe that the ghost light was nothing more than vehicles travelling along this highway.  The spot itself is difficult to get to now, as the land is owned by a farmer. He has put several signs up restricting access to this old railway in order to stop the crowds of people from coming out to see the light."
UnexplainedPhotos,2portl,p0ndskum,5,Thu Dec 18 23:37:23 2014 UTC,"Nice story. I've heard a lot of stories from old friends about there being will-o-wisps and other strange phenomenon in the surrounding area. I actually spent a good few years of my life living in Birch Hills just off of Canam Highway. My friends and I used to bike out to a place we called Old Man's Lake (because we were yelled at by an old man for swimming there) which was really just one of hundreds of lakes and streams that tear through the fucking awesome scenery that is Northern Saskatchewan. I used to hear from people about folks who have drowned in one particular lake, some dating back to the 1920's - which is strange because Birch Hills isn't even that old, so I'm not sure why so many people discovered this one little lake out of hundreds. I also have heard Virgin Lake (North East of Domremy) has old well holes on the bottom left over from previous farmers. The holes are apparently very wide and the edges are slimy and slippery... Making it pretty hard to get out if you fall in. There is one well hole in particular that is closer to shore, and I guess a kid nearly drowned after falling into it. I think they have a buoy over that spot now, if I recall correctly. It's been a few years.   Also, there is a legend or myth that claimed that the natives of the land feared some lake they believed had no bottom, and that it actually led to the spirit world. Apparently, if you swim in this particular lake the dead will rise up from beneath and drag you down with them. Telling this to a 9 year old boy is a terrible idea as it still makes me scared whenever I swim in a lake. I refuse to go farther than my waist.   Anyways, got kind of carried away there. Where did you grow up?  PA? Domremy? Wakaw? Birch?"

I have been there myself and have seen the lights. The legend is that the conductor got out of his train and was checking the tracks with his lamp, the train started to move and decapitated him. Now the conductor drives his train forevermore and searches the tracks for his lost head. There are no more tracks as they were tore up long ago, but on some nights you can still see the light of the train and a smaller light that looks like a lamp. The big light looks like a headlight of a train coming over the hill and a smaller red light bobs back and forth across where the tracks used to be. The light comes and goes and some nights you don't see it at all. The small reddish light that you can see just to the left in the trees is the weirdest as i could see it cast shadows in the trees.   A few years ago a few people replicated it with refracting headlights from the highway. It still did not explain the smaller light or the stories of people coming to see it on horseback. The mystery is still not solved.   Diaclaimer- this is not my picture but i have seen the lights myself.

I've had a long-time interest in the paranormal and unexplained (mostly UFOS), although I approach it critically. It's the ""I want to believe"" mindset-I really would like to believe this extraordinary stuff happens, but that requires extraordinary evidence.   Something like 95% of UFO photographs I've seen were just dander in the air, dirt in the lens, lens flare, planes, birds, camera shake or just blurriness. 1% were outright faked, and the final 1% had something that I couldn't easily and immediately explain.   So this photograph. Taken critically, it's a black-on-black scene with no good contextual information as to what I'm supposed to be looking at. The two lights are literally unexplained, because anything could be the cause. Lights through the trees, someone on the line with a flashlight or a hot pixel on the sensor. It's fine to say, ""this is unexplained!"", but not to use it in order to make a baseless logical jump to, ""this is a ghost train which haunts the area!""

UnexplainedPhotos,2pecxw,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Dec 16 00:14:26 2014 UTC,"Mange:        Mange is also a nickname for the name Magnus.   Mange /ˈmeɪndʒ/ is a class of skin diseases caused by parasitic mites.  Since mites also infect plants, birds, and reptiles, the term ""mange"" or ""the mange"", suggesting poor condition of the hairy coat due to the infection, is sometimes reserved only for pathological mite-infestation of nonhuman mammals. Thus, mange includes mite-associated skin disease in domestic animals (cats and dogs), in livestock (such as sheep scab), and in wild animals (for example, coyotes, cougars, and bears).   Since mites belong to the arachnid subclass Acari (also called Acarina), another term for mite infestation is acariasis.  Parasitic mites that cause mange in mammals embed themselves either in skin or hair follicles in the animal, depending upon their genus. Sarcoptes spp. burrow into skin, while Demodex spp. live in follicles.    Image i     Interesting: Mange Schmidt | Demodicosis | Psoroptes   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

UnexplainedPhotos,2pecxw,__z__z__,-10,Tue Dec 16 05:19:06 2014 UTC,Somehow that bear grew those ears after the picture was taken I assume? I'm sorry man that just looks nothing like the trail cam picture.
UnexplainedPhotos,2pecxw,coyootje,6,Tue Dec 16 05:21:07 2014 UTC,It's not the same bear my text just didn't come thru. It's just an example of a bear with mange.   Bears limbs aren't all that muscular to start off with. I've fielded dressed my fair share of bears and I've seen bears with mange. They do look a lot like the image.
UnexplainedPhotos,2pecxw,coyootje,-5,Tue Dec 16 06:18:16 2014 UTC,"I see your point about some bears having longer limbs than usual, but the creature in the photo doesn't appear to have gaps of hair loss like mangy animals do, but more just a different hair pattern than a bear."

Also, patterson film is absolutely not fake but we could argue forever on that."
UnexplainedPhotos,2pecxw,duchessdugan,2,Tue Dec 16 03:32:13 2014 UTC,"About the Skunk Ape pictures: I'm quite sure I've read it on Reddit in the past half year that someone debunked them (I think it even was a redditor). He knew quite a lot about primates and was able to logically determine that the facial proportions of the creature weren't within the realms of possibility. If I remember correctly, he said something along the lines of: ""the pictures are either fake or it's an extremely deformed creature we're looking at here.""  I'll post source if I'm still able to find it.  EDIT: I can't seem to find it anymore, it was over at /r/Wanttobelieve. The user was called something like propaniosa ape or something. Sorry I can't help out further."
UnexplainedPhotos,2pecxw,duchessdugan,3,Tue Dec 16 10:31:51 2014 UTC,"I may have been talking to the user in the very post you're talking about. But, since we're talking about an unknown primate, most of that speculation is moot, and there are plants in front of the creatures face that could explain the appearance of canines, or it could be food in its mouth (the pictures were taken by a woman who told police an escaped orangutan was stealing apples off her back porch).  He put forth a decent argument against them, but certainly nothing definitive."

UnexplainedPhotos,2pecxw,Weekoldpizza,2,Tue Dec 16 12:04:15 2014 UTC,It is absolutely fake and the people behind the fakery came forward.
UnexplainedPhotos,2pecxw,st_gulik,5,Tue Dec 16 04:38:56 2014 UTC,"Absolutely not true. If you're talking about Bob Heironimus, he's a liar and a scam artist that could provide no proof he knew anything about the film, his story fell apart when he started lying with Philip Morris, and his limb proportions and ""bigfoot walk"" don't match up in the slightest.   This may sound ridiculous coming from someone who accepts bigfoots are real, but dude... Don't believe everything some hillbilly says. Believe the ACTUAL scientific analyses done on the film."
UnexplainedPhotos,2pecxw,EdgHG,-1,Tue Dec 16 05:17:48 2014 UTC,"Are you sure about that?   I mean, in this video Thinkerthunker kinda proves for some images it's not something that's possible to fake easily."
UnexplainedPhotos,2pecxw,Mokey_Maker,23,Tue Dec 16 14:29:27 2014 UTC,"Several of these I have not seen before, and I wish there was story to go with them..."
UnexplainedPhotos,2pecxw,Brderhps951,21,Mon Dec 15 22:51:19 2014 UTC,"1.) The legendary Patty. The Patterson film has been analyzed more than any other piece of footage besides the Zapruder film, and it has not been proven to be faked to this day. In fact, the more modern technology allows people to study it, the more certain details become apparent that make it less and less likely this was a man in a suit.  2 & 3.) The Pennsylvania ""Jacobs"" trail cam photos. A bear was included in the same spot for comparison in one picture, with a chimpanzee for comparison in the other. Some people say this is a deformed bear or something, but I've yet to see a picture of a bear contorting themselves into this type of position.  4.) Alberta, Canada trail cam photo. Again, some people say it's a bear bending down, digging in a whole or something, which seems at least plausible, but the angle seems far too extreme IMHO.  5.) Vermont trail cam. The guy who put this gamecam up noticed a TON of apples were missing from his apple tree, and seemingly too high to be stolen by deer or other usual suspects. He put up the cam, and by the next week had gotten this picture on the camera. He put himself in what he thought was the same position for a size comparison.  6 & 7.) Melissa Hovey trail cam, Northern California. I included a shot of Patty's back for comparison to show the similar muscular structure. This one is so clear your brain wants to tell you it's fake, but that's some incredible costume work (that no one has claimed credit for with any semblance of proof) if it indeed is fake.  8.) This was another Pennsylvania trail cam photo on a sporting club property. There's a video on YouTube where the owner or someone stands in the same area for comparison. It's tough to tell just how big this is (likely not out of the range of human) but it looks pretty damn good, and is definitely not one of the retail bigfoot costumes you see all the time and is likely custom-built if it's fake.  9, 10 & 11.) A couple (Jane Hiebert and her husband) went to open their cabin in (I think) Vancouver, Canada and saw this creature at the top of a hill near their cabin. The story of the first two pictures is briefly described on the photos themselves. #11 was after the creature moved off, but came around the cabin shortly afterward. The third picture was taken after she heard sounds coming from outside and took a picture through the window. I'll see if I can find a link to the whole story. Edit: Here's most of it, from the bigfoot evidence blog  12.) The Oklahoma Hunter Photos. Taken by a deer hunter in Southeastern Oklahoma (a hotbed of bigfoot sightings with a very long history of sasquatches, stretching back to Native American folklore).  13.) ""Extreme Expeditions"" campsite being raided by what looks like a large white gorilla in the middle of the night. Game cam went off while their camp was being trashed, and food stolen.  14 & 15.) Myakka Skunk Ape. Taken by an elderly woman who thought an escaped orangutan was stealing apples from her porch. However, the foot that's visible at the bottom of one of the photos shows this animal to be very tall, and standing on two feet, which orangutans very, VERY rarely do. My personal opinion is these are the best still photos ever taken of a sasquatch, but some still believe it's some sort of prop.  16.) The Harley Hoffman video still. He got a video of this sasquatch walking by him, but after it passes by the tree it disappeared into the forest. Looks a lot like the Jane Hiebert photos in 9 10 & 11 I think.  17.) The Duhon family trail camera, Louisiana. Finding Bigfoot's recreation of this photo showed this creature to be 7 to 7 1/2' tall, as the bottom of the window sill is 6'6"" and they couldn't tell how far back the creature was or if it was standing on lower ground than Bobo was.  18.) The Georgia bigfoot photos. At first I thought this was a picture of a gorilla walking on two feet, but the proportions don't line up.   19.) Taken by a 9-year-old boy in Alaska who had an extreme close-up sighting. Independent investigator found this thing to be extremely tall when he was taken to the spot. Video  20.) Infamous ""Lake Worth Monster"" photo. Taken during a road crossing event in Texas in the 70s during a flurry of bigfoot sightings.  21.) Todd Standing's (IMO) hoaxes. They haven't been totally proven to be fake (and even have the semi-endorsement of bigfoot academic Dr. Jeff Meldrum), but I just don't think they look like organic creatures."

UnexplainedPhotos,2pecxw,thaloopdigga,0,Mon Jan 26 14:11:24 2015 UTC,He would have had to hit a major growth spurt before hand and then shrink before taking the comparison picture.

That'd be a remarkable coincidence at the very least. The other bird you're referring to was figured out pretty quickly if it's the one I'm thinking of...
UnexplainedPhotos,2pecxw,yoss250,1 point,Thu Dec 18 05:43:41 2014 UTC,"The guy was posing for the picture so he was motionless. There's a picture of a coyote from the same trail cam that's blurred just like this one. I think any animal that's moving at all when the camera goes off will end up at least a little blurry.   I've already been convinced by the pool of existing evidence (most notably, the PGF, the Sierra Sounds, and the Cripplefoot Trackway) that these things are real, so we'll have to agree to disagree on what's more likely to create that shape. I'll see if I can find the coyote pic and link it for you.   Edit: here it is."

Those are compressed and lousy files. this link shows individual toes, caked with the sand from the bank she walked along, pretty clearly. There were also a number of casts taken of the trackway left by that creature that day. All of them bear the same trademark midtarsal break and splaying toes that nearly all likely-legitimate sasquatch casts have.   You should read jeff Meldrum's paper on the inferred morphology of the sasquatch foot. It explains how what's shown in the PGF matches up perfectly with the gait and physiology of the subject. It's pretty wild stuff."

It can't even see any proper shadows, however if there are it is not hard to do, just add a light source or beam (in the CGI program) where one of the windows is and bam, the light automatically effects the creature and casts shadows where the buildings are (by making a 3D object that is invisible but can still show shadows)"

As far as the courts are concerned, it's done. Good job, you got the bad guys. They're in jail. But it doesn't feel done,"" she said.  The man pictured was shot and killed on December 3rd, 2009 outside an apartment complex near Preston and Gilmore in Louisville.  ""People heard the shots. He was actually chased by his assailants and he was shot,"" said Wescott.  The picture came from a phone found in a nearby apartment that may or may not be his.  Within a month of the murder, five suspects were arrested.  Keith Fowler, Cedric Johnson, Ashley Marshall, Jonathan Downs and Devan Peterson have since been charged and convicted for the murder.  ""They targeted him for a robbery and he resisted and they killed him,"" Wescott told WDRB.  Because of the circumstances, it's a murder, Wescott says, that would normally go unsolved.  ""This is solved because two 6th division detectives Todd Roadhouse and Derrick Brooks, arrested another young man for a robbery and he gave information.""  Detective Wescott says they've gone to extreme lengths to try to identify the victim.  ""We reached out to homeland security and to immigration to see if they could help us out through fingerprints or identification, criminal histories, anything. Nothing.""  The victim is buried at River Valley Cemetery in southwest Jefferson County. Some St. Xavier students raised money to buy him a headstone and to perform a proper burial. Because of his Hispanic heritage, the students engraved Juan Doe, instead of John Doe.

UnexplainedPhotos,2nv4o7,Mlg123,23,Sun Jan 4 00:49:19 2015 UTC,"Here is some more information:  By Jan Bondeson June 2007 Fortean Times  On 8 May 1733, when the master builder Johan Gråberg went to inspect the quarry of Wamlingebo (now Vamlingbo) in Sweden, two of the quarrymen came running up from the excavation in a most excited state. While cutting large blocks of sandstone more than 10ft (3m) below the surface, one of them had discovered a large frog sitting in the middle of a sizeable boulder he had just cut in two with his hammer and wedge. Gråberg followed the workmen down into the quarry, where he too was startled by the sight of the frog sitting inside the boulder. Part of the stone nearest the frog was so porous that the violence of the blow had fragmented it, destroying the impression of the animal’s body. Since the frog was in a lethargic state, Gråberg could not provoke it to move, even when he lifted it out on a spade. When he touched its head with a stick, it closed its eyes. Its mouth was covered with a yellow membrane. The master builder’s examination of this mysterious stone-frog was cut short by his impatience: for some reason, the Swede wantonly beat it to death with his heavy shovel. The quarrymen put the flattened body of the supernatural animal on a polished slab of stone and laid it in state in their cabin.  Later the same afternoon, Gråberg was struck by belated qualms of conscience “for being the Slayer of that extraordinary Animal, which might have lived for many hundreds of years within its stony Prison”. He returned to the quarry and took the frog with him to Stockholm, where he showed it to several scholars. Among them was a provincial medical practitioner named Dr Johan Pihl, who submitted a paper on the strange stone-frog to the Swedish Academy of Sciences. But only the brief section containing Gråberg’s account of the discovery of the frog was published in the Academy’s Transactions. It was illustrated with an engraving of the frog’s cadaver, showing a section of the quarry where it was found.  Read more: http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/477/toad_in_the_hole.html"

His name is a reference to the fictional character Rip Van Winkle. In 1897, a horned lizard was placed in a cornerstone of the Eastland County Courthouse in Eastland, Texas along with other time capsule memorabilia. When the courthouse was torn down 31 years later, the cornerstone was opened on February 18, 1928, a live horned lizard was produced, allegedly from within the time capsule. The lizard became a celebrity, and went on tour, even being taken to Washington, D.C. to meet President Calvin Coolidge.     Interesting: Michigan J.

As well as 13 or 14 labyrinths, there are more than 850 heaps of boulders on Bolshoi Zayatsky Island, plus numerous other stone settings such as a stone symbol with radial spokes, possibly representing the sun. All the labyrinths are concentrated in an area of 0.4 km2 on the western part of the island.  The function of the stone settings is unclear. One suggestion is that they may have symbolised a border between this world and the underworld and the labyrinth may have been used for specific rituals to help the souls of the dead travel to another world. Another hypothesis is that the settings may have served as a model for complex fishing equipment  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_labyrinths_of_Bolshoi_Zayatsky_Island  On a small collection of remote islands in the White Sea of Russia lies the highest concentration of ancient labyrinths on the planet. Despite numerous theories, archaeologists and historians have not come to any agreement about why they were built and what their purpose was. The labyrinth remains one of the most mysterious symbols found on Earth – thousands of years ago, it appeared at the same point in history on all inhabited continents in the world – why?  Many hypotheses have been put forward to explain why the Neolithic settlers of the Solovetsky Islands went to the considerable effort of constructing numerous stone labyrinths.  In the 1970's, the predominant hypothesis, advanced by N. Gurina, was that the labyrinths were built as traps for fish.  Evidence comes from the fact that all of the labyrinths in the region were built close to the sea and water levels were much higher 5,000 years ago, when it is believed they were constructed.  The fish would have swum in through the entrance and become trapped in the labyrinth, making it easier for fisherman to retrieve their catch.  However, the major flaw in this argument is that numerous labyrinths have been found inland throughout the world. Researcher L. Ershov had a different theory.  Ershov maintained that within the lines of labyrinths was the schematic reflection of both the sun's and moon's orbits, thus the labyrinths were used as calendars.  However, this has been debated on the basis that labyrinths do not have a consistent direction of entrance. One theory popular today, particularly among esoteric circles, is that a labyrinth is an ancient symbol that relates to wholeness.  It combines the imagery of the circle and the spiral into a meandering but purposeful path. It represents a journey to our own centre and back again out into the world. Walking the labyrinth can be considered an initiation in which one awakens the knowledge.  It is believed that walking the path of the labyrinth brings about a change to one’s state of consciousness and the perception of time and space   http://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-places-asia/ancient-stone-labyrinths-bolshoi-zayatsky-001573"

UnexplainedPhotos,2m3u8p,KushQueen,13,Fri Nov 14 00:38:17 2014 UTC,"Here is some additional information:  Several museums around the world contain bizarre once-living artifacts of a pseudo-legendary beast from the Middle Ages called a “rat king.” A rat king is formed when several rats have their tails fused together, whether by knotting or being somehow glued together. The result is a small horde of rats all facing outward from the central knot, presumably forced to act as one composite beast. The more fanciful accounts hold that one leader rat is suspended in the middle and acts as the “head” who directs the rest—a nightmarish notion, especially considering the fears of plague that rats conjure up.The largest of these disturbing artifacts contains 32 of the little horrors and resides at the Mauritianum Museum in Altenburg, Germany. Some existing rat kings are mummified, while others are preserved in jars. Rat kings have been found in Germany, France, Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Indonesia. In every case except Indonesia, the rats were black: Rattus rattus L. In the case of Indonesia, they were small field rats: R. argentiventer.As recently as 2005, a farmer named Rein Koiv found a rat king consisting of 16 individuals (nine of which were already dead) underneath the floorboards of his farm in Estonia, their tails glued together by frozen sand. Rat kings aren’t always composed of rats; mice kings and even squirrel kings have also been reported. In June 2013, an animal clinic in Canada received quite a shock when a city worker brought in six squirrels fused to each other’s tails by tree sap. They managed to save the plucky squirrels—their tails were partially shaved but they were otherwise intact.

UnexplainedPhotos,2lyzru,blackvault,80,Tue Nov 11 15:25:16 2014 UTC,"Here is some background:  One of the best documented cases of physical trace evidence is known as the ""Falcon Lake Encounter."" Occurring on May 19, 1967, the lone participant was Stephen Michalak, who was a mechanic by trade, but his hobby was prospecting for silver.  He was enjoying his favorite pastime when he encountered two UFOs, and actually touched one of the unknown flying objects that had landed in his vicinity.  The first object remained on the ground for 45 minutes. It made a whirling sound and gradually changed in colour from grey to silver. Then a hatch opened and the object emitted a bright violet light. Michalak claimed that he heard voices from within. He called out to the voices in English, German, Italian, Polish, Ukrainian and Russian. There was no response; instead the hatch closed quickly as if the inhabitants were spooked. Michalak reached out and touched the object as it began to revolve and take off, and he was instantly pushed back by a force of hot air. The blast burned his clothing and left marks on his chest. After he ripped off his clothing, Michalak felt ill. He began to vomit and noticed a metallic smell coming from inside his body, like the burning smell of an electric wire or an electric motor.

Well, he had originally been in the park prospecting for silver ore. What better way to keep your competition out of an area than to claim that you were attacked and almost killed there? Throw in his attempts to convince the world that the park was highly radioactive as a result of the activities of space aliens, and there’s about as much proof that he’s trying to keep competition away as there is that the event really occurred. The fact that he later staked a claim in the area certainly doesn’t hurt.  When it boils down to it, there’s nothing about this case that I couldn’t reproduce in my kitchen. Give me a case of beer, my stove, and a handful of supplies, and I could be Stefan Michalak. No aliens needed. Is it possible that he's telling the truth, that he was burned by a flying suacer? Yes.

She was apparently thrown off the Interstate 10 bridge 36 - 48 hours prior to discovery. Her body was found when a trucker called authorities to report a body of an adult wearing a blue plaid shirt and blue jeans, floating in the river. The Jackson County Sheriff's Office believes the body is the mother of the child found floating in the river. Detectives said the theory is based on the fact that a woman, who was obviously distressed and carrying a child, was seen walking on Interstate-10 on the previous Friday night. This is further confirmed by a Moss Point woman who was monitoring CB conversations that night. She said ""truckers were 'raising-a-boat-load-of-Hell' between midnight Friday and 1 AM. Saturday because a woman and child were walking on the interstate and refused to let anyone help her."" Authorities said a woman wearing a blue plaid shirt and blue jeans and carrying a child was seen near the scales at the Alabama line walking west on the interstate. She was reported walking in the westbound lane. A man who saw the woman said a pickup truck stopped but she refused to get into the truck. Authorities speculate the woman may have thrown the child into the water and then jumped. The baby still had a breath of life because she had sucked in some of the murky water into her lungs. It is unclear if the body of the woman was recovered. The unidentified toddler is buried in Jackson County Memorial Park. Deputy Moore and his wife stepped forward and made sure the little girl was given a proper funeral and burial in 1982. 200 people attended the young girl's funeral. The circumstances of her death remain unknown and no arrests have been made.  edit: http://doenetwork.org/cases/45ufms.html"

They come across a trucker that the woman quickly realizes is trouble.  She leaves, and as she's walking along the highway, she refuses help from truckers.  She distrustful of them because of the creep she met at the truck stop.  He somehow gets to her, and in the kerfuffle the child is harmed.  The trucker tosses her over the bridge, takes the woman, and later calls the police to bring their attention to the child's body.  Maybe he felt guilty about the child, or was trying to appease the still-alive woman, or something.  Apparently, the trucker has at least at one point been a suspect: Can DNA advances solve cold case? Monday, September 07, 2009  By CHERIE WARD   Staff Reporter   Advances in DNA technology could prove the strongest chance for investigators to determine the identity of Baby Jane, an unknown infant girl found dead in Dog River 27 years ago.   The case of the 18-month-old child, also referred to as Delta Dawn, who was found floating in the river Dec. 5, 1982, has been a troubling mystery for years until a recent break in the cold case.   Jackson County Sheriff's investigator Hope Thornton said the body of the child was exhumed in November 2008 to obtain DNA samples, hoping to link her to another cold case out of state.   ""In March 2008, I was contacted by a California coroner,"" Thornton said. ""The family of a young girl who disappeared about the same time saw the digital composite of Delta and wants to know if she could actually be theirs.""   Allegedly, the boyfriend of the girl's mother stated he kidnapped the child and killed her but has never told authorities where the child's remains were hidden, Thornton said.   ""He's in jail,"" she said. ""Whether or not this is the child or not, we just don't know, yet. Right now, we're having a hard time getting viable DNA.""   But investigators have also not ruled out a truck driver as a prime suspect in the child's demise.   Ted Hammond of Florida reported seeing a dead body in the Escatawpa River as he drove over an Interstate 10 bridge.   Thornton said she interviewed Hammond when she took the case over eight months ago.   ""He's still a suspect in my book,"" Thornton said.   According to a Dec. 7, 1982, report in the Mississippi Press, Hammond said he saw an adult body floating 1,000 feet west of the I-10 bridge that runs over the Escatawpa River.   Sheriff's investigators later found the baby 10 miles north of that bridge but never found an adult.   A Dec. 8, 1982, report describes a woman with a baby walking west on I-10 near the truck scales at the Alabama-Mississippi state line.   ""Even with age and time, there's no way things can change as dramatically as his story has,"" Thornton said, declining to give details because of the ongoing investigation.   The Jackson County Sheriff's Department adopted the baby shortly after she was discovered, and deputies paid her funeral expenses.

Reporting their discovery to police, authorities retrieved the fully clothed, badly-decomposed body of a young woman from the lake. The woman bore no identification, although she wore a green shirt, green plaid pants, and a green floral poncho. She also wore a white gold watch, a gold necklace and her fourth finger bore a gold ring with a transparent stone.  A forensic examination of the remains concluded the victim had been killed approximately thirty days prior to her discovery, although she may have been deceased for up to two months.  A man's size 36 belt was fastened around her neck, strongly indicating ligature strangulation as the cause of death  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Miss_Lake_Panasoffkee  http://unsolvedmysteries.wikia.com/wiki/Little_Miss_Panasoffkee  http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/470uffl.html"

It was named Waratah after the emblem flower of New South Wales, Australia, which appears to have been an unlucky name: one ship of that name had been lost off the island of Ushant in the English Channel in 1848, one in 1887 on a voyage to Sydney, another south of Sydney, and one in the Gulf of Carpentaria in 1897  The most popular theory advanced to explain the disappearance of the Waratah is an encounter with a freak wave, also known as a rogue wave, in the ocean off the South African coast  Both at the time of the disappearance and since, several people have suggested that the Waratah was caught in a whirlpool created by a combination of winds, currents and a deep ocean trench, several of which are known to be off the southeast coast of Africa  Given the evidence from the officers of the Harlow, it has been speculated that the Waratah was destroyed by a sudden explosion in one of her coal bunkers  Several supernatural theories were also put forward to explain the disappearance of the Waratah. Claude Sawyer reported to the London inquiry that he had seen on three occasions the vision of a man ""with a long sword in a peculiar dress. He was holding the sword in his right hand and it was covered in blood.""  In recent years, incidents involving seabed methane upwellings have shown that it is quite possible for structures fully capable of floating on water, to readily sink in water whose density has been reduced by volumes of methane gas in bubble form.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Waratah"

UnexplainedPhotos,2jxfpp,malibar1,7,Tue Feb 10 15:30:17 2015 UTC,"info;  The spooky incident happened on October 7, when Flight Engineers Reid Wiseman of NASA and Alexander Gerst of the European Space Agency conducted a spacewalk outside the International Space Station to fix an electrical problem.  In video shot by NASA and uploaded to YouTube last week, the UFO can be seen hovering just for a few seconds behind the astronauts, before the camera cuts to another angle.  As always, the size and shape of the mysterious craft could not be made out and of course, the footage appeared grainy  The UFO appears during the video at around the 1.50 minute mark and the apparently elliptical craft hovers a short distance behind one the astronauts.  According to the Examiner one possible explanation for the UFO is that it could be one of two resupply craft that visited the ISS.  The Space X Dragon ship arrived at the ISS on September 23 and that space ship was followed up two days later by a Soyuz TMA 14M craft that brought three new crew members.  However, both the craft are currently docked with the ISS and the UFO in the video appears not to be attached to the ISS.  A more likely explanation than a craft piloted by beings from another planet observing human astronauts is lensflare.  Light could easily have bounced off the ISS and refracted onto the camera.  But, observers have pointed out that there doesn't seem to be a strong source of light near to the astronauts when the UFO is seen."

The temple is 75 feet high and once had 40 foot ""comb"" on it's top.   According to legend, the temple was built according to exact instructions from 'sky gods', incorporating advanced astronomical and mathematical data, including directions to add a certain amount of steps every 52 years.  Mexican archeologist Alberto Lhuillier discovered a secret tomb-like chamber in 1952 which held a large intricately carved slab known as ""the Spaceman"". It's still the topic of debate as to what it means (if it wasn't important, why would it be hidden in a secret chamber?). Some say it looks exactly like a man at the controls of some kind of machinery, complete with foot pedals and hand levers.  Also found was a duct that runs from the tomb up the inside of the stairs and opens in the temple floor.

Each disc is claimed to measure up to 1 foot (30 cm) in diameter and carry two grooves, originating from a hole in their center, in the form of a double spiral.[3] The hieroglyph-like markings are said to be found in these grooves.

Scholars who conclude that the inscribed symbols are writing base their assessment on a few assumptions which are not universally endorsed. First, the existence of similar signs on other artifacts of the Danube civilization suggest that there was an inventory of standard shapes of which scribes made use of. Second, the symbols make a high degree of standardization and a rectilinear shape comparable to what archaic writing systems manifest. Third, that the information communicated by each character was a specific one with an unequivocal meaning. Finally, that the inscriptions are sequenced in rows, whether horizontal, vertical or circular. If they do comprise a script, it is not known what kind of writing system they represent. Some archaeologists who support the idea that they do represent writing, notably Marija Gimbutas, have proposed that they are fragments of a system dubbed the Old European Script.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tărtăria_tablets  http://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-places-europe/do-tartaria-tablets-contain-evidence-earliest-known-writing-system-002103  http://www.prehistory.it/ftp/tartaria_tablets/tartaria_tablets_01.htm"

To this day it remains a case in which all the facts involved support the witnesses claims and it is this kind of case that makes the ufo phenomenon such an enduring mystery. Lonnie Zamora saw a highly unusual device of unknown origin, what can only be described as a ""craft"" of some kind, and he reported seeing what he believes were occupants. Despite the controversy which often surrounds the subject of UFOs, the incident at Socorro remains an example of what the UFO phenomenon is, in fact, all about.   The following information is based on facts I have gathered from various sources including conversations in person and by telephone with Mr. Lonnie Zamora. This is not intended to be a complete report on Lonnie Zamora's experience, but is intended to provide a source for some resh details about the case and to clarify others. More than anything else I have made every effort to ensure that what is here is the truth. I also owe a great deal of gratitude to Mr. Ray Stanford, one of the most thorough and knowledgable investigators I have met. He arrived in Socorro within four days of the incident and authored the definitive book on Zamora's experience and the subsequent investigation. I recommend it to anyone seriously interested in this case and in the subject of UFO's in general. ""Socorro Saucer"" in a Pentagon Pantry"" is available in major libraries but can be obtained from the author. Socorro is a small town located about an hours drive south of Albuquerque, New Mexico . In April 1964, Lonnie Zamora was a police officer with the town and late in the afternoon on April, 24th he had just dropped his pursuit of a speeding car to go check on what he thought might have been an explosion on the outskirts of town. Thinking that a small shack containing dynamite might have exploded, he made his way up a rough embankment and then moved slowly along a narrow gravel road that wound beside a small arroyo (a shallow dry gully). From this first more distant vantage point he saw what he thought might have been an overturned car down in the arroyo and radioed back to his headquarters that he was proceeding to check out this 'vehicle'. It was from here that he saw what he described as possibly two children or small adults, and he noted that one appeared startled at his approach and seemed to ""jump somewhat"".   http://www.ufoevidence.org/cases/case90.htm"
UnexplainedPhotos,2jdhi7,inkmathematics,5,Thu Oct 16 00:59:19 2014 UTC,This is one of the best eyewitness cases on file.  Zamora is beyond reproach and an unimpeachable witness who has revisited the story many times.  Other officers and scientists had seen the landing site and worked on the investigation for years.

Betty listened for a while and was startled to hear the woman say, “This is Amelia Earhart. This is Amelia Earhart.”  Betty was always “crazy about airplanes” and was well aware of Earhart’s World Flight. Today, at 78, she can’t recall whether or not, on this particular day, she already knew that Earhart was missing but it was clear to her that Amelia was in trouble so Betty opened her notebook and started to make notes about what she was hearing. The words came too fast for her to get everything and often she would only write a word or two of what had been said. The signal faded in and out, sometimes stopped altogether for several minutes and at other times was quite distorted, but Betty tried her best to get down at least some of what was being said. If she wasn't sure about a word she would just write down what it sounded like to her.  Betty heard not only Amelia’s calls for help but also her comments to a man who was with her. Betty had the impression that the man had sustained a head injury and was delirious. She gathered that they had crashed on land but that there was also great concern about rising water. The man would alternately struggle with Amelia and try to get the microphone away from her or panic and try to get out of the airplane."

UnexplainedPhotos,2jahw6,Fallenangel152,35,Wed Oct 15 18:56:12 2014 UTC,"Yah the notebook, if it really was Amelia this girl was recording, definitely supports that. Sounds like a guy with a head injury, deliriously trying to get out of the plane because it is filling with water. But the female on the radio knows that there is no where else to go, so keeps trying to pull him in. If they were on land I'm sure they would have done something other than sit in a plane that was flooding, so they probably landed in the ocean and the plane didn't sink right away.   Personally, I would much rather have crashed in to something and died quickly, than drown while I was fully awake and aware of what is happening :("

It is a remote, elongated, triangular coral atoll with profuse vegetation and a large central marine lagoon. Nikumaroro is approximately 7.5 kilometres (4.7 mi) long by 2.5 kilometres (1.6 mi) wide. There are two narrow entrances through the rim, both of which are blocked by a wide reef which is dry at low tide. The ocean beyond the reef is very deep and the only anchorage is at the island's west end, across the reef from the ruins of a mid-twentieth century British colonial village, but this is safe only with the southeast trade winds. Landing has always been difficult and is most often done south of the anchorage. Although occupied at various times during the past, the island is uninhabited today.

UnexplainedPhotos,2jahgp,blitzballer,62,Wed Oct 15 04:56:41 2014 UTC,"Reason for why the doors wouldn't close: She pressed the ""DOOR HOLD"" button.  This is an image of the buttons in the elevator, you can google for some other photos taken of it if you want.  Photo: http://i.imgur.com/we6I2JX.jpg  Note that DOOR HOLD is not the same button as the ""open doors"" button most of us have seen/used, which will just open the doors. DOOR HOLD is used to keep the doors open for an extended time, and are usually found in freight elevators and such.   Door hold button is used to hold the door open for a desired period (normally three to five minutes) for loading goods, baggage, bed or stretcher. This button is especially common in freight and bed/hospital elevators. Door hold button is normally identified as Extend Open, Open Hold, DH or simply Door Hold or Hold. Sometimes, this service requires a keyswitch   source: http://elevation.wikia.com/wiki/Elevator_door_control#Door_hold_button  In the video we can see her pressing multiple buttons, she presses all the buttons in the middle column:    14  10  7  4  M  B  DOOR HOLD   Door hold is the very last one. You can even see the doors start closing and then open up again, just when she presses the hold button.   The doors stay open like they should after pressing DOOR HOLD. She starts moving around, then she starts pressing all the buttons in the middle column again, and ends with DOOR HOLD.  I'm guessing it'll return to ""normal state"" again if you press floor buttons, but [edit: According to the video I linked to in my other comment, you need to press the close doors button to end the door hold mode it seems] she keeps ending with pressing the DOOR HOLD button. It's the very last button she mashes.  Then she goes outside, stands there for a while doing weird movements with her hands, probably trying to break the sensor beams with one of them for some reason. And then she gives up.  Then there's a cut in the video which is only showing the doors standing open due to DOOR HOLD. Eventually they close and the elevator starts going to all the floors of which buttons she pressed.   About the cut in the video [~54 seconds cut out]:   The LAPD released the video, and I don't find it weird if they would have cut 1 minute out of the doors just standing there open. What might be weird is that they decided to keep anything after she left. But I suppose it's possible they didn't know what the hell was going on at that point and just figured they would keep it. Who knows."

The L.A. County Department of Coroner ruled the death “accidental due to drowning” and said no traces of drugs or alcohol were found during the autopsy. However, there is much more to the story than what is implied by police reports. The first piece of evidence that needs to be considered is an elevator surveillance tape that recorded Elisa’s behavior only a few moments before she lost her life.  The four-minute video posted on YouTube shows Elisa pressing all of the elevator buttons and waiting for it to move. Seeing that the elevator doors are not closing, starts behaving extremely bizarrely. Here’s the video.  http://thestir.cafemom.com/in_the_news/163050/3_seriously_creepy_circumstances_surrounding  http://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/mysterious-case-elisa-lam/  http://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2013/11/30/what-killed-elisa-lam-whose-body-rotted-for-2-weeks-in-a-hotel-water-tank/"
UnexplainedPhotos,2jahgp,lie4karma,5,Wed Oct 15 04:57:58 2014 UTC,"The behavior in the elevator could simply be a girl goofing around, and the weird hand gesture being merely to keep the door open.  She lost her phone at a ""speakeasy"" a few days before.  She suffered from a great deal of depression for years.  She went into the tank with her clothes, which were recovered with her watch and managed to get into the tank without injury.  Maybe she saw the movies, maybe she wanted to recreate it and live on as a ghost. Maybe she crawled in, hiding from a perceived threat. Either way, she almost definitely got into that tank on her own, and she wasn't attacked beforehand.  I don't rule out the possibility that she wasn't interacting with an actual person, while waiting at the elevator. She may very well have been waiting for someone. Maybe that person never showed. However, I can't rule out that she was just being goofy.  In the end, I can't find fault with the conclusion that her death was accidental/indeterminate, as the circumstances, while strange, seem to be explained, easily, enough.  Ultimately, it is a haunting story for a number of reasons... the last minutes before death, the fact that everyone drank and showered in the remnants of her body, and the end of young woman who had struggled for years with mental illness.   It isn't beyond people to find really strange ways to commit suicide, like the kid who pretended to be a woman online, to convince his best friend to kill him, or the person who stuffed their airways with pages from the bible. People who commit suicide often want to convey a message to others with their last act. Sometimes the message takes strange forms."
UnexplainedPhotos,2jahgp,NHDT,25,Fri Jan 2 23:28:24 2015 UTC,This case has ALWAYS bothered me.  She was found inside a water tank that was locked from the outside.  They had to cut her out.  The tape this still comes from has been showed to be edited (for unknown reasons).... My money is someone in the hotel who knew there were cameras there.  Why else would the elevator start to move again only after she got off... not all the time she spent onit.
UnexplainedPhotos,2jahgp,lie4karma,6,Wed Oct 15 07:32:18 2014 UTC,"Locked how though, a lever or something or a padlock? I imagine closing the hatch intentionally or unintentionally and it locking (lever falling down or whatever) isn't out of the question. Or somebody finding the open hatch and closing and locking it (she was in there for a while before found).  Is the video the police obtained edited, or just the video we've seen on the internet? I imagine people don't really care for 10+ minutes of nothing happening and such.  What is this about somebody in the hotel knowing there were cameras there, and what does that have to do with the elevator behaving like it did? From what I remember reading, it's a pretty shitty/shabby hotel, and the elevator probably is too. And she's pressing a lot of buttons when entering the elevator, might cause problems for it. Or it was just having a bad day.  Somebody manipulating the elevator would require access to the control panel, and probably knowledge on how to operate elevators. Something elevator engineers/maintenance people do.   A shitty hotel with poor management (unlocked doors etc) and a person suffering from schizophrenia or some other mental illness could explain everything."
UnexplainedPhotos,2jahgp,Highwayman,4,Wed Oct 15 09:26:32 2014 UTC,Watch the video.  It doesnt explain why the tapes were edited and why the elevator will not work while she is on it.  Only after she gets off does it immediately start to work again.   Both videos were edited.  It was slowed way down. You can watch the time stamp in real time.

UnexplainedPhotos,2jatqo,blitzballer,28,Wed Oct 15 08:09:19 2014 UTC,"info;  The victim was located inside a tent along a service trail south of San Pedro Avenue, just off of Highway 1 in Pacifica, California on June 6, 2006.   The tent she was found in contained many books, including two Bibles, a Busy Womens Journal with several scriptures noted and Harry Potter. On the tent were letters made of tape stating, No go, no eat, no drink, murder.  Her fingerprints were run through the county system and revealed a picture, name, date of birth and place of birth. All the information was fake.   Police picked up the woman in January for walking along the expressway acting erratically. She was booked into the San Mateo County Jail by the California Highway Patrol. The name she gave at the time of her arrest was Sam Smith, with a date of birth of January 20, 1960 and a birthplace of Louisville, Kentucky. She was released with no charges.  The cause of the woman's death remains undetermined because her body was too badly decomposed to allow a ruling. But officials don't believe she was murdered because there were no obvious signs of trauma.  According to the coroner's report, the woman left writings in some of her books that indicated she planned to starve herself to death. Toxicology tests were inconclusive.   Investigators found a newspaper in the tent dated March 2, which could indicate she'd been dead several months.   Coroners have tried to match her with the dental records of several other missing persons but have not found a match.  http://doenetwork.org/cases/593ufca.html"

UnexplainedPhotos,2iwdb4,blitzballer,18,Fri Oct 10 22:39:26 2014 UTC,"The tired man, suffering from colon cancer, put a .38-caliber gun to his mouth and committed suicide in July 2002 in a tiny apartment in Eastlake.  Joseph Newton Chandler III had died again.  The first time was in 1945, when he was 8.  Now, U.S. Marshal Pete Elliott is looking into how and why the Eastlake man stole the little boy's identity and lived 24 years as a fake. Elliott said he believes the man, who appears to be in his late 60s, took the youth's personal history to cover a past that included unsolved crimes. The marshal said that based on the way the man lived and the elaborate way he concealed a life of lies, he was a violent fugitive.  Elliott has spent six months examining the case, following up on a detailed investigation by Eastlake police detectives. He has looked into links involving handfuls of fugitives from New Hampshire to California. He has examined long shots, such as the Zodiac Killer, who terrified San Francisco in the 1960s and 1970s, and inmates who escaped from Alcatraz.  He hasn't ruled out the Eastlake man in those cases, but he has in others, including fugitives in Oklahoma and Ohio.  From a desk filled with piles of folders, Elliott has stared at pictures of the dead man and compared them to mug shots of aging fugitives. He has looked at prison records, dental X-rays and time-enhanced photo images.  Elliott has even formed a behavioral profile of the man: He suffered obsessive-compulsive disorder, worked at Edko Co. in Cleveland and later at Lubrizol Corp. in Wickliffe, specializing in electrical engineering. He didn't drink or smoke and was anti-social, seldom appearing to be at ease in public.  http://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2014/10/chasing_a_ghost_us_marshal_inv.html#incart_m-rpt-1  Discussion on r/UnresolvedMysteries;  http://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/2iv8jm/us_marshal_updates_joseph_newton_chandler_case/  Previous photo/report;  http://www.reddit.com/r/UnexplainedPhotos/comments/2f4qyw/on_july_30_2002_joseph_newton_chandler_iii_an/"

UnexplainedPhotos,2iq4l9,Bluecat72,21,Thu Oct 9 16:35:47 2014 UTC,"Sure. I have some that are like that, too. It happens naturally when the leader is damaged by heavy snow that melted slowly, forcing the main branch to grow vertical as a new leader. But these are 400 trees planted in 22 nearly straight rows, and they're all damaged on the same side at around the same time.   There's a strong history of using a bent brace in boat construction called a ship's knee. A knee is simply a curved piece of wood. Before laminating became easier the best way to make a ship's knee was to grow it, as you need the grain to flow along the curve. The other way to obtain a grown knee would be to use the roots, but then you have to dig out the stump and can't see what you're getting before hand."

UnexplainedPhotos,2iq4l9,GodDammitCaesar,14,Fri Oct 10 00:35:59 2014 UTC,"info;  All of the trees have the same northward 90-degree bend at the base of their limb. Known as the “Crooked Forest,” this unique site remains an unexplained mystery.  Every tree in the Crooked Forest has the same haunting bend, but despite bent beginnings, all of the trees have grown to be tall and seemingly unhampered by their C shape curves. Some experts believe that the trees grew like this because they incurred some sort of damage to the tip and along some side branches.  The Crooked Forest is around 80 years old. It is estimated that the damage that made them look how they do today occurred when the trees were about 7 years old. This would have been before the Second World War reached Poland.  Which helps to explain the most popular theory about how the trees came to be crooked. As the story goes, in 1930 a group of farmers planted these trees, intentionally damaging the base in order to create some sort of product, perhaps uniquely shaped furniture. The world may never know if it’s true because the farmers were unable to finish their work after the invasion on Poland during World War II dismantled their plans.  Others surmise that a snowstorm could have knocked the trees like this, freezing them into a bent position until the snow and ice melted come spring. The possibilities are truly endless when it comes to this unsolved mystery.  There are plenty of trees in the area, all of which grow upright from the base without the funky curve distinct to the Crooked Forest clan. The Crooked Forest is an odd occurrence in a seemingly ordinary place.  http://www.slavorum.org/mysterious-photos-of-unexplainable-forest-in-poland-2/  http://news.discovery.com/earth/plants/polands-crooked-forest-mystery-110628.htm"

UnexplainedPhotos,2ip1sz,blitzballer,20,Wed Oct 8 20:39:57 2014 UTC,"info;  http://paleo.cc/paluxy/meister.htm  A fossil of what looked suspiciously like a footprint was discovered near Delta on June 1, 1968, by William J. Meister Sr., an amateur fossil hunter. Meister and his family had gone to Antelope Springs, 43 miles northwest of Delta, for a family vacation.  It was while searching for trilobite fossils that Meister found a fossil with the impression of what looked like the sole of a shoe, with the heel imprint deeper than that of the rest of the foot. Below the shoe imprint were two trilobites, leading Meister to believe the wearer of the shoes had stepped on them.  Researchers found that the fossil had been formed in Middle Cambrian Wheeler Shale between 505 million and 590 million years ago. Upon examination of the area, they found slabs of mudstone that had once formed a land surface that could have been walked upon.  The problem with the fossil is that it was found in the same area as trilobites, which were marine creatures. There was also no evidence of pressure being exerted on the trilobites when they were supposedly stepped on. The mystery of the fossil's origin remains unsolved.  http://www.ksl.com/?sid=22682446"

Supporters contend that the hand is from a Yeti, a scientifically unrecognized animal purported to live in the Himalayan mountains. Critics argue the artifact is a fraud.  Oil businessman and adventurer Tom Slick first heard accounts of the possible existence of a ""Yeti hand"" held as a ritual artifact in the monastery at Pangboche during one of his first ""Abominable Snowman"" treks in 1957. The Slick expeditions were the first to bring photographs of the hand back to the West.  During later Tom Slick-sponsored expeditions in and around the Himalayas, his associates gathered more information on the ""Pangboche hand,"" and an effort to further examine it was planned. In 1959 Peter Byrne, a member of Slick's expedition that year, reportedly stole pieces of the artifact after the monks who owned it refused to allow its removal for study.  Byrne claimed to have replaced the stolen bone fragments with human bones, rewrapping the hand to disguise his theft.

Uses animated effects to create camera shake, which leaves signs in the footage if you know what to look for.   Each piece of footage released anonymously. Always a red flag. Why would someone remain anonymous with something like this? They could make a fortune. Instead, they post it anonymously to YouTube. Right.   But you only have to think about it. This is Jerusalem. You know the IDF are kind of tense about things flying over Jerusalem, particularly the Dome of the Rock.   This is one of the most heavily defended airspaces in the world. If this really took place, that whole sky would light up with anti-aircraft fire and missiles.   Furthermore, Jerusalem is a place where people spend a lot of time looking up for obvious reasons. And there would have been hundreds if not thousands of people at the site even at night (I've been there at night, it's usually packed).

UnexplainedPhotos,2i8915,O_oh,4,Sun Oct 5 19:25:44 2014 UTC,"Settle down dude, this was a film project.   It was proven a hoax years ago. The motion and the light is CGI..  One of the people who took the ""video"" is Eligael Gadliovich, an actor with a film producing company.  The other three uploaders were film students.  Also, this happened over the 'dome of the rock', which is the 3rd holiest site in Islam.  Muhammad jumped/flew from Mecca and landed on that rock in Jerusalem.  They built a mosque over it.  If this was seen, people would say it is The prophet Muhammad not a UFO.    You probably don't believe in Muhammad, its ok million of people do, what more evidence do you need?  On top of all that, Israel shoots down anything Unidentified flying over its airspace without confirming with the target.  Especially if it was Muhammad.  Technically Israel is still in a state of war with some of its neighbors, so it just shoots down anything that's not theirs.   In 2014, so far, Palestinians launched 4005 rockets attacks that resulted in only 60 Israeli casualties.  You can do the math and figure out how many of those rockets were intercepted. Last week a Syrian MIG accidentally flew into Israeli airspace for a few seconds and was shot down by Israel surface to air missiles when the MIG was already back in Syrian airspace.  No questions, no apologies.    It is absolutely silly seeing a UFO over Israel and not seeing jets scrambled and the Iron Dome blitzing the skies.  Sirens would go off and after a few people sees the UFO, twitter and Facebook would explode with statuses and thousands would come out to see/record.  When Osama Bin Laden was assassinated there were Pakistanis live tweeting the sounds of the raid from miles away.  That was in small town.  The lack of twitter/FB traffic about the UFO over a major metropolitan city is really evident of its validity.    If this video was from the 1991 then I would believe it, but now such things needs modern cross-confirmation."

Layering is visible in the crater walls, as are large boulders that were thrown out in the material ejected from the impact. The ejected material likely once resided deep within Vesta, since this crater formed within the deep Rheasilvia impact basin. It may provide clues to Vesta's composition at depth.  This image was obtained by Dawn's framing camera image was acquired on Dec. 21, 2011, during Dawn's low-altitude mapping orbit (on average 130 miles or 210 kilometers above the surface). Rheasilvia is located at the south pole of Vesta. The image covers an area of 260 square miles (670 square kilometers).

UnexplainedPhotos,2hs8kh,ShouldBeAnUpvoteGif,5,Tue Feb 10 07:35:50 2015 UTC,"Crinoid:       Crinoids are marine animals that make up the class Crinoidea of the echinoderms (phylum Echinodermata). Crinoidea comes from the Greek word krinon, ""a lily"", and eidos, ""form"".   They live both in shallow water and in depths as great as 6,000 metres (20,000 ft).  Sea lilies refer to the crinoids which, in their adult form, are attached to the sea bottom by a stalk.  Feather stars  or comatulids  refer to the unstalked forms.  Crinoids are characterised by a mouth on the top surface that is surrounded by feeding arms. They have a U-shaped gut, and their anus is located next to the mouth. Although the basic echinoderm pattern of fivefold symmetry can be recognised, most crinoids have many more than five arms. Crinoids usually have a stem used to attach themselves to a substrate, but many live attached only as juveniles and become free-swimming as adults.  There are only about 600 extant crinoid species,  but they were much more abundant and diverse in the past. Some thick limestone beds dating to the mid- to late-Paleozoic are almost entirely made up of disarticulated crinoid fragments.

According to archaeologist JR Bhagat, these paintings have depicted aliens like those shown in Hollywood and Bollywood flicks. Located about 130km from Raipur, the caves come under village Chandeli and Gotitola.   ""The findings suggest that humans in prehistoric times may have seen or imagined beings from other planets which still create curiosity among people and researchers. Extensive research is needed for further findings. Chhattisgarh presently doesn't have any such expert who could give clarity on the subject,"" Bhagat told TOI.  There are several beliefs among locals in these villages. While few worship the paintings, others narrate stories they have heard from ancestors about ""rohela people"" — the small sized ones — who used to land from sky in a round shaped flying object and take away one or two persons of village who never returned.   ""The paintings are done in natural colours that have hardly faded despite the years. The strangely carved figures are seen holding weapon-like objects and do not have clear features. Specially, the nose and mouth are missing. In few pictures, they are even shown wearing space suits. We can't refute possibility of imagination by prehistoric men but humans usually fancy such things,"" the archaeologist said.  more photos at the link;  http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/10000-year-old-rock-paintings-depicting-aliens-and-UFOs-found-in-Chhattisgarh/articleshow/38435091.cms"

It's not the skeptics - skepticism is good, when it is objective. It's not the Phil Klasses of this world - they are exposed well enough in time.  It is the kooks and cranks in the field, the wild claims without evidence, and lack of rigorous research standards. Hell, even Travis Walton says this!  This image is definitely pareidolia. There isn't any doubt of that.  It isn't even a very compelling example of pareidolia.  When there's evidence that we're seeing anomalous objects on Mars, then that would be time to write papers and present it to the world.  All researchers of the unexplained should have a basic understanding of psychological effects and the nature of human perceptions.   This, this right here? It is just helping keep UFO research in the crank bin in most peoples' minds. It is not helping."
UnexplainedPhotos,2hfzb4,boyubout2pissmeoff,0,Fri Sep 26 03:31:49 2014 UTC,"Well, first off, I really don't disagree with much of what you said.  So, not much to debate. I've known Travis for a long time, and have a lot of respect for what he says... and about what he's experienced.  So, again, no disagreement.  But I will comment on one thing that did stick out:  ""This image is definitely pareidolia.""  That right there is closing off any possible, well, anything other than simply dismissing all ""evidence"" put forth that may show something. Is this the smoking gun? Nope, nor was it posted as such.  Is it so ridiculous it should be put in the trash file? I wouldn't say that either.  Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of trash out there. And I personally dismiss a lot of it -- but to say I am definitely sure that this, or that, doesn't exist. Well, unless I actually have  proof - I don't try.  Do I believe it's lights and shadows? Yeah, I kind of do.  But I can't prove it to you. Just like I can't not prove it either. So, although I am not bowing down to this area of Mars claiming that's where my Alien Brothers are, I file it away in the, ""Hmmm"" category -- pass it on for others who care enough to look at it -- and I move on.  I'm not rude, I don't insult along the way, and I never tell people they are hurting a field - when they are simply trying to share information.  That's what hurts this field -- not a NASA/JPL photo.  Dismissal, and saying stuff like ""definitely"" will get both sides of the debate in trouble."
UnexplainedPhotos,2hfzb4,cmon_now,4,Fri Sep 26 03:39:13 2014 UTC,"""This image is definitely pareidolia.""  That right there is closing off any possible, well, anything other than simply dismissing all ""evidence"" put forth that may show something.    There are better things to spend research time on that shapes in rocks.  We know pareidolia is a real psychological phenomenon. We know the human mind is hardwired to see shapes in random patterns. This is a documented fact.  Anomalies on Mars are not.   The other potential anomalous explanations for this (rather prosaic looking) rock can be determined to be vanishingly unlikely due to other evidence - for one, an intelligently shaped object could not survive at the Martian surface without being destroyed and/or weathered by the extreme variations in temperature and erosion.   For this reason something like this should be roundfiled.   There are plenty of odd images or reports that deserve the attention and objective analysis. This is not one of them.   I'm not rude, I don't insult along the way, and I never tell people they are hurting a field - when they are simply trying to share information. That's what hurts this field -- not a NASA/JPL photo.   Look at the ridicule that this post has received in a sub more than ordinarily disposed to accept wild claims. Now imagine what it would receive from people outside of the fringe phenomena research fields.  By association, these people then connect the rest of the material posted by such a source with the same scorn. This is the problem. And UFO researchers must be aware of this.    That is why we get the cute TV media segments on UFO reports backed with the X-files theme and jokes about Star Trek. That's one of the reasons why we haven't moved forward in 50 years.   I'm sorry my observations have hurt your feelings, but sometimes the truth hurts. This does not help the UFO research effort and undermines the credibility of a researcher.    Do I believe it's lights and shadows? Yeah, I kind of do.    Then I don't understand why you would post it.  This is absolutely beneath a researcher of your caliber."

The modern clothing style was first produced by Champion in the 1930s and marketed to laborers working who endured freezing temperatures while working in upstate New York.   Seeing as they were originally marketed toward workers in New York (albeit upstate) I'd say there's nothing out of place about him at all.

UnexplainedPhotos,2hbddb,thomasboleyn,16,Thu Sep 25 04:56:21 2014 UTC,"One of the most unique accounts of alien abduction comes to us from the Ilkley Moor in Yorkshire, England. The witness and subject of this case is a former policeman named Philip Spencer. Spencer claims that in the early morning of December 1, 1987, he was taken aboard an unidentified flying craft, and after his release managed to snap a picture of one of the alien beings. The Ilkley Moor is very much as you would picture it. Reminiscent of the setting of the moors of Baskerville Hall in Conan Doyle's ""Hound of the Baskervilles."" it is an eerie place. It has been said that ""The Ilkley Moor can scare you to death during daylight, and at night it's even worse.""  It is a place of mystery. There is the Swastika stone; boulders etched with strange markings; the Badger Stone; and the Twelve Apostles stone circle.  http://www.ufocasebook.com/ilkleymoor.html  http://ufocasebook.com/ilkleymoor2.html  http://www.ufocasebook.com/ilkleymoor3.html  The photograph that Spencer took was first analyzed by a wildlife expert. He concluded that whatever was in the photograph was not any known animal. There was no way to ascertain if the subject of the photograph was a living creature or not just by looking at the picture. A recreation of the setting of the photograph was undertaken, and it was estimated that the creature was about four feet tall. An analysis of the photograph was done by Kodak laboratories in Hemel, Hempstead. They concluded that the object was indeed part of the original shot, and not added later.  http://ufos.about.com/od/aliensalienabduction/p/ilkleymoor.htm  http://ufos.about.com/od/ufosjan2012/a/Ilkley-Moor-And-The-Men-In-Black.htm"

Another rover was just sent to Mars and was in orbit around it as of yesterday or this morning, iirc. Could it be that coming in for a landing?   I don't quite see the contrast in focus that /u/12_FOOT_CHOCOBO is speaking of, but regardless, it doesn't look in focus enough or out of focus enough to be something on the lense. Also, there aren't really any sticky things on Mars that could be stuck on the lens. And as OP pointed out, it is only in this one picture. It could be a meteorite, it could be the other rover coming in, or it could be something else entirely. Good contribution!"
UnexplainedPhotos,2h90zj,12_FOOT_CHOCOBO,2,Wed Sep 24 00:27:44 2014 UTC,"Doesn't have to be on the lens, could just be something blowing by"
UnexplainedPhotos,2h90zj,tendorphin,0,Wed Sep 24 01:25:47 2014 UTC,"True. That also raises the question of what, though. The atmosphere of mars is less than 1% of what Earth's is, so the air is incredibly thin. Most likely too thin for any substantial breeze to form, and there isn't exactly a lot of leaf-litter up there to be blowing around. AFAIK, the entire surface is rocks and dust. That doesn't look like dust to me, and again, for having a rather ferrous crust, I don't think the atmosphere would be thick enough to carry any of that dust along anyway. For some numbers, the earth's atmosphere's pressure is over 100,000 pascals at sea level. On mars, even in its deepest cavern, the pressure is only 1,100 pascals. That's a huge difference, and even on earth, it takes a pretty good breeze to get stuff that's just lying on the ground to fly up into the air.   It definitely could just be something blowing by, but, personally, I think that is very unlikely. I also think it is unlikely that it is some sort of alien craft. I think the best guess at this point would be a meteor passing through."
UnexplainedPhotos,2h90zj,12_FOOT_CHOCOBO,5,Tue Sep 23 20:40:39 2014 UTC,"One can only speculate, but we know winds on mars have gotten upwards of 60 mph, more than enough to carry light debris."

Stuff that shows up white just means it is warmer than stuff that shows up black.  There is no way to tell what color she is actually wearing, and she's probably sitting in the sunlight.  How can you even determine that her clothing style is out-of-date for the early '90s?  From one of the articles supplied by OP:   Upon developing the film, the image of a woman was discovered sitting on a gravestone, who was NOT present when the photo was taken.   I've seen plenty of photos in this subreddit where someone walked into frame, wasn't noticed by the photographer, and walked off.  It is such a common occurrence, that it seems barely worth mention at this point.  Also I see no evidence whatsoever that any part of her body is even slightly transparent."

UnexplainedPhotos,2glw1b,blitzballer,17,Tue Sep 16 23:15:09 2014 UTC,"info;  In the summer of 1957, during his second year of digging at the Goddard site on the central Maine coast, amateur archaeologist Guy Mellgren found a small silver coin near the center of the site, at a depth of 5"" below the surface. In 1978 the coin was identified by Peter Seaby, a British coin dealer, as a Medieval Norwegian penny. This identification was confirmed in 1979 by Kolbjørn Skaare, a leading authority on Medieval Norse coinage, who examined the coin at the Maine State Museum and arranged for neutron activation testing of a small fragment from it. Skaare's analysis confirmed the coin's authenticity as a Norwegian penny issued during the first half of King Olaf Kyrre's reign, AD 1065-1080. The Goddard coin remains the only pre- Columbian Norse artifact generally regarded as genuine found within the United States.  Extensive archaeological investigation of the Goddard site has revealed no evidence for a Norse settlement there. Rather, it seems to have been the locus of a sizeable native settlement between 600 and 900 years ago, quite possibly the largest Native American village in Maine at the time. It is possible that the Norse visited this village, leaving the coin behind in trade. However, there is a good deal of evidence that the Goddard village was an important hub within a far-ranging native trade network, one which brought goods from as far away as Pennsylvania, the Great Lakes and Labrador to the site. Thus, we think the most likely explanation for the coin’s presence is that it was obtained by natives somewhere else, perhaps in Newfoundland where the only known New World Norse settlement has been found at L’Anse aux Meadows, and that it eventually reached the Goddard site through native trade channels.  http://www.state.me.us/museum/anthropology/norsecoinpage.html"

UnexplainedPhotos,2g339b,jaredog,25,Thu Sep 11 15:42:53 2014 UTC,Looks to me like she's talking.  Whoever took the picture just caught her  mid-word.

UnexplainedPhotos,2g339b,SleepyJoel,3,Fri Sep 12 06:46:15 2014 UTC,"At first glance it looks as if she is smiling, which is what I first thought. After coming across the comment mentioning she looks distressed I went back and took a longer look. If you zoom in on her face I think it helps to show she is in fact distressed and not smiling. I think the most telling sign of this is her eyes, when you zoom in they look baggy as if squinting from crying. Her mouth also seems to be emoting a crying noise and her bottom lip looks as if it is curled like it would if you were frowning with your mouth open. Also the way she is crossing her arms seems to me as a way of trying to comfort herself, it doesn't seem like a happy way of crossing her arms.  It's hard to be sure but I definitely think she looks more scared than happy."

UnexplainedPhotos,2g339b,CreakyJohn,6,Wed Feb 11 16:52:05 2015 UTC,There have been discussions about the Jamison family in r/unresolvedmysteries.   My theory has always been that the family went hiking in the woods and got lost. Its very easy to have that happen in rural Ohio and the facts of the case seem to suggest that its plausible.
UnexplainedPhotos,2g339b,drazgoosh,4,Thu Sep 11 22:37:39 2014 UTC,"Didn't they find the bodies laying side by side? If that's the case then it's most probably murder/suicide. My theory, for what's worth, is that the mother had a complete breakdown and killed her child and partner, then destroyed herself. It was her handgun that was missing from the family home."
UnexplainedPhotos,2g339b,5abrina,4,Sun Sep 14 14:52:05 2014 UTC,"Aren't murder-suicides quite easy to spot though? I'm no expert but in this scenario the killer will then commit suicide (probably with the weapon used) and die next to the victims, potentially still holding the weapon..."

UnexplainedPhotos,2g1xet,notdogwelder,9,Thu Sep 11 04:07:33 2014 UTC,Plus a shot like this is easy to fake. They always back it up by saying the photo is real. Well of course the photo wasn't manipulated but it's not hard to slow the shutter speed down to get this effect.  I feel like for these photos to be more credible we need proof that this isn't someone standing in the window looking spooky. Unfortunately without video evidence it's impossible to prove and it comes down to if you want to believe or not.
UnexplainedPhotos,2g1xet,testikron,3,Thu Sep 11 05:42:21 2014 UTC,ELI5 exactly how to do this?
UnexplainedPhotos,2g1xet,Mustaka,9,Thu Sep 11 10:13:12 2014 UTC,"Cameras have a shutter speed which is how long the film is exposed to light that essentially burns in the image to the film.   A really fast shutter speed will capture fast moving things like drops of water in the air.  A slow shutter speed will perceive movement as a blur since it's not able to capture the image immediately. This is how we get pictures where car lights look like lines along the highway or waterfalls look like smooth white streaks.  To get a picture like this just put the camera on a low shutter speed and move around. The background will still be in the image but you will appear to be translucent and ghost like. Fot added creepiness keep your head atill while waving your arms and legs. You don't need any sort of post photo manipulation to easily make a pic like this, so it always makes me a bit skeptical."
UnexplainedPhotos,2g1xet,testikron,7,Thu Sep 11 14:17:44 2014 UTC,"Whenever I hear ""I saw nothing unusual when I took the photo"" I always think that must mean it's from the flash or some other incidental artifact that doesn't really reflect what was actually going on in the frame at the time.  If you saw nothing unusual when you took the photo, then it must not be there. If it were actually a ghost, you would have seen it."

UnexplainedPhotos,2g1xet,TheTazerPanda,40,Thu Sep 11 06:17:46 2014 UTC,"info;  A set of photos taken in the O'Hare Mansion in Greencastle, Indiana, showing the ghost that became known as the Pink Lady of Greencastle.  The photo above was taken by Guy Winters during a paranormal investigation in O’Hare Mansion in Greencastle, Indiana. It came to be called “The Pink Lady of Greencastle,” owing its name to the ghostly figure of a lady seemingly lit by a pinkish glow.  A friend told Winters that he and his girlfriend had a scary encounter with a ghostly entity during an attempt to have a tryst in the abandoned property. So, Winters, along with another friend Terry and a team of paranormal investigators, explored the O’Hare Mansion upon being granted permission by the property’s owner.  Armed with VHS video cameras and simple flash cameras, Winters and his group began documenting their search for several days. Finally, the group began to feel something spooky during one of their night visits. While some of his companions covered the interior of the ruined mansion, Winters started taking photos of the windows and doorways outside. He did not recall seeing anything, but when the film was developed, there it was: the vapory but also visible figure of a lady staring out from one of the windows. She is believed to be the ghost of Irene O’Hare.  The fourth frame on the lower right shows a screenshot from the analysis done on one of the photos snapped by Winters, showing something distinctly skull-like. The verdict of the photographic expert? The figure of the Pink Lady was registered on the film and was not caused by a camera malfunction or questionable activity.  http://www.lomography.com/magazine/lifestyle/2011/10/25/creepiest-ghost-photos-ever-the-pink-lady-of-greencastle  http://paranormal.about.com/od/ghostphotos/ig/Best-Ghost-Photos/The-Pink-Lady-of-Greencastle-picture.htm  http://www.ghosthauntings.org/Pink_Lady_Of_Greencastle.html"

Common animals in the shows were monkey's and primates. Sometime in the 50'/60's the laws changed and the shows were outlawed. Instead of finding paces to keep the animals, or selling them to zoo's many of the animals were released in the wild. Can there be a group of primates in the Everglades somewhere? It's possible. Could these be the reason that there are stories of Swamp Apes? It's probable. Is this a picture of one of those? I'm thinking not. Especially in Sarasota, where there really aren't any good swamps/wild lands to keep a group of Primates. I remember seeing this from a show on History Channel or H2.

They found that every North American sample sent in was a sample of another, known species (usually a bear or a wolf). However, only one region sent in samples that resulted in significant data: the Himalayas.

UnexplainedPhotos,2fhqco,Prosopagnosiape,31,Thu Sep 4 22:27:08 2014 UTC,"Oh bloody buggery I just spent 45 minutes writing a wall of text on this one then closed the window somehow.  Bah! Right, starting from the top then. I'll try and keep it short. Or maybe I'll spend another 45 minutes on it, we'll see.   First up, if there are any real skunk ape sightings at all, they're almost certainly a known species of primate that has escaped or been released rather than a new species, since there's bugger all of a primate fossil record in North America until a few tens of thousand of years ago when there was a sudden influx of a large and ungainly primate called H. sapiens sapiens. So I'm gonna be comparing to known primates.  So, this photo. The canine teeth are what stand out most to me. They're needle-thin, in contrast to these big thick gorilla teeth, orang utan teeth, chimp teeth, and lets throw in a capuchin too so the South American platyrhines get some representation. The skunk ape teeth seem almost more dog-like than primate! Not only that, they're pointing inwards rather than out, which would be fairly useless for biting. That reminds me strongly of a rubber werewolf mask I have whose teeth point in when no head is filling the mask up.  Not much else is visible in this photo, but it's one of two, so lets have a look at the second photo, which is clearer. Here it is.  Looking from one to the other, only a few pieces of it's body have moved, the head and the foot. That's very unlike a primate, especially the arm being in the exact same position and having moved so little that the reflections on the arm hair are the same in both, if a primate is standing, the arms are moved around for balance. If it's not, they're moved for walking.   This picture, giving a slightly clearer view of it's head, has led some people to declare the skunk ape an escaped orang utan. It does look very similar to a female orang utan in the face (and they do sometimes come in rather fetching darker shades!) but there are also some issues with it (aside from those tiny teeth). The hair on it's arms points down all the way down, which is fine and dandy for most primates, but on orang utans the hair below the elbow points up in the other direction (1 2 3) towards their elbow rather than towards their wrist. There's also that foot you see in photo 2. Orang utans, more than any other ape, are very arboreal, hardly ever coming down to the ground until they grow too large to travel easily though the canopy. Their feet are perfectly built for gripping round branches, but not great for walking on flat earth. When they walk on the ground they don't flatten their feet out, they curl them around and walk on the sides of them (1 2 3)  I don't think it's someone in a costume due to the size of the head and how it sits in front of the shoulders rather than on top, but I do think it's a slightly poseable model based on how little it moves and what we can see of it's anatomy. It's a good one though! I think some special effects student somewhere did a great job on it and is probably chuffed it got passed around so much."

UnexplainedPhotos,2fhqco,autowikibot,5,Fri Sep 5 00:29:01 2014 UTC,"This could be a stupid thing to ask but you know how humans can get genetic mutations that drastically change there appearance, is that possible/common in primates?  Even though its very slim, what if it was some sort of disfigured/disabled primate that caused these weird changers?  Really liked the part about the teeth pointing in the ways by the way, thats a clue to it being some sort of design, but the second photo it looked liked its moved a bit? that would have took and insane amount of work to make it that detailed and yet be able to change position like that. On top of that the colour of the eyes in both pics raise questions, the fact that the eyes are red in the first picture suggests This effect from cameras it could be a living thing as that only appears in animals that have tapetum lucidum and would be hard to recreate."
UnexplainedPhotos,2fhqco,dalek_cyber,12,Fri Sep 5 01:21:43 2014 UTC,"Hello! We're really not as different from the other primates as we look at first glance, and the more familiar you are with primates the more similar we seem. The most important difference is, of course, the size of our craniums (and brain). Tiny mutations can cause huge differences in size, you can see this in reverse today in humans with microcephaly, who have small craniums and sloping foreheads very like our recent ancestors. It was several small mutations that set those changes in motion and led to us developing our intelligence. For instance, there is a gene related to language called foxp2. We're not the only ones to have a version of this gene by a long shot, you'll find it in every mammal and bird, but ours differs from our closest chimp cousins by only two amino acids, a minute mutation.  What about the huge difference in our face, our mouth and nose? At a glance we look very different from a chimp, but the only difference is our jaws. The other apes have very powerful muscles that wrap from their large jaws all the way to the tops of their heads, but our huge craniums get in the way of that, so we can't develop jaws as large and powerful. We are also very neotenous, and built very similarly to a baby chimp so we wouldn't need huge mutational changes to give us this face, simply a halting of the development of the adult ape facial features. If you're interested, here's a chimp I photoshopped crudely a while back to have jaws the same as humans, only the jaws are changed. What a difference it makes in making them look like us! Edit2: we're also not the only primates to have developed flatter faces, here are some spider monkeys about as distant from humans as you can get except for lemurs. Primates have huge variation! The opposite end of the spectrum are the mandrills and baboons with their long doglike faces.  Another thing that seems to set us apart is our upright posture and long legs, but that's not as unique people think. Have you ever heard of a bonobo? Often people only know of chimps, gorillas, and orang utans because bonobo behaviour was too scandalous for biologists a century ago to tell the public about them. They are gentle cousins of chimps, diverged from them two million years ago, and alongside chimps are our closest relatives. However, while chimps are better adapted for trees, bonobos are built very similarly to our common ancestors. They often walk upright! They're almost uncannily humanoid in shape with their slim build and long legs. Edit: standing chimp comparison, longer arms, shorter legs, lower head, bigger chest  Which leaves hair, unless you can think of any other large difference you'd like to talk about? Single genes being active or dormant can turn hair on or off. There's a decent number of chimps in zoos and sanctuaries who are varying degrees of hairless, here's one! And here's another shot of an upright bonobo, who has very little body hair. I'm sure I've seen much hairier humans! Actually, while I'm at it, perhaps you've seen pictures of humans with hypertrichosis, whose hairiness genes have been switched on?  As for the colour of the eyes, have you ever seen 'cats eyes' marking roads in the dark? They were designed after, you guessed it, cats eyes, and the way they reflect light. They're special marbles made to shine, white or red, when light hits them. Wouldn't be too hard to get a couple of them to serve as a model's eyes!  (On a bit of a tangent but my favourite road sign is this, I think it'd be hilarious to have one outside my taxidermy shed)"

UnexplainedPhotos,2fhqco,dalek_cyber,11,Fri Sep 5 02:08:43 2014 UTC,"Oh, it could happen, never say never! There can be some odd looking individuals within species. Check out Oliver the chimp, who looked so unusual that people thought he was a human/chimp hybrid. Measurements taken showed all his features were within normal extremes for chimps, he just happened to get a lot of extremes, and genetic tests confirmed it, just an unusual chimp. As you said before, it's 'disfigured', different individuals like that that drive evolution into new species. I still don't think the skunk ape has the look of a real creature about it though, heh. Tooth deformities are pretty common in humans but less so in longer jawed animals, and developing flat feet like that is something that takes many generations of selective pressure, too 'perfect' and functional for a one-shot deformity."

Theatrical followspot operators, positioned nearly coincidentally with a very bright light and somewhat distant from the actors, occasionally witness red-eye in actors on stage.

Even with nothing to go on, I still wouldn't find this compelling though owing to the notorious amount of hoaxes and the ease with which you can fake ""ghost photos"".

Perhaps they wanted to get the candles in the shot. I would be hesitant to use the framing as the only argument that it's staged.  However, to bolster the point that it could be staged or just a double exposure is that there's no explanation or news story on the front page of Google.

What frustrates me is the conspiracy theorists that believe the most outlandish crap with no evidence whatsoever. It's one thing to question, but be smart about it! Ask not ""is that a ghost caught on camera?"" but ""I wonder what that is?"" Too many people immediately jump to ridiculous conclusions then use any tactic to defend their pre-determined conclusions. I have no reason to doubt the Moon landings. Why? Because it's a totally believable scientific undertaking with actual, physical evidence. We have physical evidence. We have people who have been there. People are in space, right now. Yet apparently this is less believable than ghosts conveniently appearing in photos. See how ridiculous this is?"

If you think a bunch of people who were out to deliberately take people for chumps then you're not giving them enough credit if you think they wouldn't have been creative enough to have the idea of giving it breasts.  Assuming it's fake, the suit in the film strikes me pretty much as a labour of love. There's a lesson to be learned from crop circles that after their emergence, people descended on the scenes calling themselves seriologists and credulously told people and the press that the cirlces couldn't possibly be the work of fakers because for a variety of reasons and because you couldn't do that overnight.

UnexplainedPhotos,2f9qwc,Prosopagnosiape,2,Fri Sep 5 16:20:34 2014 UTC,"In saying ""this isn't making a cool design with grass"", you're missing the point entirely. Crop circles convinced a lot of people, who could all point to various features supposedly indicating they weren't faked and would claim it couldn't be replicated (often, as you do, by pointing out simply that it hadn't yet been replicated). And yet the fakers confessed and showed their methods to the world. But even then belief that crop circles aren't man-made hasn't completely gone away.  With the PGF, you get to the conclusion of it being genuine or fake by picking your experts. You are very definitely wrong when you infer that taking time to study it at length makes it compelling. The wikipedia article shows this much in its analysis section with experts of different stripes taking varying places in a spectrum of belief to disbelief.  This is why I don't dismiss the PGF as ""clearly a fake"" because there are definitely reputable scientists who find it compelling. But at the same time, I'm not going to make the mistake that it's beyond human fakery just because it lumbers in a particular way or it has breasts."

UnexplainedPhotos,2f9qwc,Prosopagnosiape,27,Tue Sep 2 19:33:42 2014 UTC,"The only thing that is unexplained is who is in the suit really. Not only is it exactly human proportions, moving with a human gait, it has a few biological cock-ups you'll only find in a costume! For instance, see that tapering dome on the top of it's head, like on gorillas? In real apes (and some other strong-jawed animals) that is a whole lot of muscle attached to the sagittal crest,   powering the large, extremely strong jaws, and limiting the size of the cranium. Humans, with our huge craniums, have no space for such strong jaw muscles to wrap around and attach on top in the same way, and have much smaller jaws than the other apes. In the video you have something that has a human sized cranium, with a gorilla's sagittal crest and muscular dome plonked on top, which would have no way of reaching and no point in powering the tiny human sized flat-face jaws.  Edit: Just so I don't paint myself as a nay-saying sceptic without an open mind, I'm really into cryptozoology! I'll happily spend hours looking at all the available photos of recent 'thylacine' sightings and try and figure out what other striped animals they usually are or whatever else might point to them being real or fake, since I'd dearly love to see them rediscovered, or any other cryptids (since there's no way we've spotted every species, unknown  animals are turning up all the time). I'm also a dedicated ape enthusiast, and I'd love for there to be more large primates still out there waiting to be discovered, after all, the gorilla itself was once more or less a mythological creature until skins and skulls were brought back, and even in recent times new species and subspecies turn up, like the bili apes, a type of unusually large and predatory chimp with some gorilla-like morphology (they have sagittal crests, which most chimps don't). Unfortunately for me this just means I'm particularly good at dashing my own hopes whenever a photo of an ape-cryptid turns up!"
UnexplainedPhotos,2f9qwc,ghostintheruins,7,Tue Sep 2 19:15:53 2014 UTC,Who is in the suit...http://www.strangemag.com/chambers17.html
UnexplainedPhotos,2f9qwc,Prosopagnosiape,8,Tue Sep 2 19:59:04 2014 UTC,"Pretty much everything you just said is wrong. The jaws are low-set and wide, like a great ape's, which would explain the presence of a sagittal crest. The low-set jaws even force the creature to turn backward with its whole upper-body in order to glance behind it, just like a gorilla or orangutan would.  Also, the proportions do NOT match up with your average human, I'm not sure where you got that information, but you can see pretty clearly the arms hang too low to be your average human.  Also, the gait is entirely UNUSUAL for a human being. Now, I'm not saying it's ""impossible to replicate,"" like some bigfoot-nutters will argue, because humans CAN walk like that, we just don't usually. It's a compliant, bent-knee walk that we usually employ walking down hills to reduce the impact on our joints and spine. The center of gravity stays at one level position instead of bouncing up and down like a human walking on flat ground.  Now, these points don't prove (by themselves) that this is a great ape in the film (even though I'm 100% convinced it is), but they all line up perfectly for what a great ape of this size would walk and look and move like."

The head also rises a good way above the shoulders and is very large compared to the body, which also points to it being a man in a suit, certainly no known ape. (Edit: also if it is an ape it's deaf! Couldn't get that close to a wild ape without it letting you know it knows you're there, not unless you have the stalking skills of a cat)  Second one reminds me very much of the classic! I'm gonna go with 'gorilla suit' again, since it has a human stance and proportions, but the muscular short neck and shoulders of a quadrupedal gorilla. Lovely looking costume though, I'd love to see it close up. Bet it would look pretty good on all fours, often the costumes just stick fur on a human shape but that one really has the shoulders and neck re-shaped to be gorilla-like. Probably not very mobile though! On the topic of the skunk ape and bigfoot in general, I think if there are any, they're known species of apes that have been kept as pets and released once they turned out to be too aggressive after puberty (that sort of thing happens with big cats and crocodiles and such so no reason it wouldn't for apes). I doubt there are any unknown apes endemic to the Americas, since there's never been any fossils or modern remains. In any case, apes are pretty habitual! Set up a few trail cams where there's been a sighting and wait a year, if it's there it'll probably show up again.  Have you heard of homo floresiensis?"

UnexplainedPhotos,2f9qwc,Treedom_Lighter,5,Tue Sep 2 20:53:03 2014 UTC,"They are very interesting! A population of humanoids so different from us, existing so recently. If no one had reached their island they would probably be there to this day, and they leave hope for more things like them still to be discovered in out of the way places. Shame there are so few corners we haven't reached yet. Maybe there are some interesting things still to discover on North Sentinel Island, whose tribal inhabitants violently reject any attempts at contact.  I love gigantopithecus! Amazing that such a huge primate existed, taller than even the tallest humans ever by quite some bit, and much more built! They're not so long gone either, though a good many tens of thousands of year longer gone than floresiensis. I hope some less fragmented remains turn up at some point, I'd love a better look at what shape they really were."
UnexplainedPhotos,2f9qwc,TheAngryDesigner,2,Tue Sep 2 21:03:52 2014 UTC,"It's argued that homofloresiensis wasn't actually a separate species, but was infact just a regular human with Down syndrome. http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/08/140804151510.htm"
UnexplainedPhotos,2f9qwc,petepeyote,1 point,Tue Sep 2 22:36:53 2014 UTC,"I don't buy into that theory, since they found multiple floresiensis skeletons (all with the same stature and features) and no human skeletons as old on that island. Still on the fence as to if H.floresiensis was a close relative of modern humans or a descendant of a more archaic hominid like H. erectus, both sides have decent support."
UnexplainedPhotos,2f9qwc,LuciusMichael,2,Tue Sep 2 22:42:06 2014 UTC,"That raises a question for me: have we discovered all land masses in all the oceans? Is it possible there are civilizations out there on islands that have never made contact with the modern world? How likely is that, if you had to take an educated guess (or a factual statement!)"
UnexplainedPhotos,2f9qwc,SlimJim814,2,Wed Sep 3 05:44:36 2014 UTC,"Yes, we have discovered every landmass. Before the days of space travel the answer might have been less certain, but now with satellites circling the globe we have complete photographic maps (available at your fingertips), with every speck of land pinpointed and every new volcanic eruption or shifting sand bank noted. There are many very tiny landmasses that haven't been stepped on (often they are for sale, if you have a couple of million currency to spare and fancy your own exclusive tiny beach resort!) but they are far too small to sustain human populations.   North Sentinel Island that I mentioned up there in the other post is in a pretty unusual (and possibly unique) position, being a relatively large island with an uncontacted tribe on it (if you want to know more about them, not that there is much info out there, coincidentally there is a post on them on the /r/unexplained photos front page) but as far as we know the only other uncontacted peoples are deep in various jungles. Fewer of them every day too, since they're a popular subject for ethnographers, anthropologists, explorers, and even tourists would you believe, who go on 'contact holidays' searching sections of rainforest for people to dazzle with beads and mirrors."
UnexplainedPhotos,2f9qwc,Trevizzle0101,2,Wed Sep 3 14:16:45 2014 UTC,"My personal pet theory is that giganto = sasquatch's relative and homo florensiensis = orang pendek's. Neither is extinct, they're just very good at hiding from the more dangerous primates - us."
UnexplainedPhotos,2f9qwc,Astrocragg,1 point,Fri Sep 5 13:53:43 2014 UTC,"It's possible! We know a few species survived long past all their relatives, like those dwarf mammoths that hung on on a small island when the pyramids were built. I don't hold out much hope for gigantopithecus, that'd be a long, long way for it to run to and the last bones we have of it were many thousands of years old, but it's much easier to hide something small! The people of Flores have even said there were 'hobbits' around not so many generations ago until the humans pushed them into the deep jungle (though that could just be folk tales, of course) In any case, if we're lucky, at the very least there's probably hobbit bodies out there in caves that are recent and well preserved enough to get dna from! I'd love to see the debate of it's relations settled, and also the possibility of cloning them at some point if they're gone."

Since the time the owner of those fossils (G. blacki) died, the Bering strait was (for a while) an arboreal land bridge that many species traversed.

The kid's back story to the video completely makes sense for running into a sasquatch, and it just feels extremely real to me, from the movements of the animal to the fear in the guy's breathing.  The second one I believe to be a hoax/misidentification/stumpsquatch. There were two photos that showed this exact same shape in this exact same position, but the photos were taken about 20-50 feet apart on the opposite shore.

UnexplainedPhotos,2f6zlz,blitzballer,9,Thu Sep 4 04:36:56 2014 UTC,"I haven't read about the whole case, but could it be possible he thought his shoe was in one of the tubes, climbed up on the tubes fell head first (blunt force trauma) and then died subsequently?"
UnexplainedPhotos,2f6zlz,blitzballer,8,Tue Sep 2 01:03:32 2014 UTC,He didn't have any injuries on the top of his head though.  The private examiner said he has blunt force trauma injuries to his neck while the coroner said he was asphyxiated.   It seems crazy to me that he fell down far enough that his feet weren't showing but his head didn't hit.  The mats were about the same height as him (6 feet).

UnexplainedPhotos,2f6zlz,RedditMan2048,13,Sun Sep 7 18:55:44 2014 UTC,It's the sort of details you'd expect from a high profile cover up. Clearly he was murdered.

UnexplainedPhotos,2f6zlz,RedditMan2048,2,Fri Oct 3 02:27:46 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure there's much to indicate something's a miss here. The wiki article doesn't go into details about the supposed blunt force trauma and what that might imply. Blunt force can be significant but it can be circumstantial as well. Edit: Looking at this article about the trauma makes me wonder if the kid was perhaps beat up and then stuffed in the rolled up mat in an act of bullying, akin to locking someone in a locker.  It also doesn't go into details about why it's thought that the cameras are missing footage from the motion-activated system. The citation doesn't go into detail about this as far as I can see. I think someone just didn't put the citation mark in the right place.  The article about video I think reveals a more about incompetent admins for the camera system than anything nefarious. Consider the following:   Two cameras in the gym are missing an hour and five minutes, their hiatus ending at 1:09, when Johnson enters the gym. Another pair of cameras are missing two hours and 10 minutes each. They don't begin recording again until 1:15 and 1:16, according to their time stamps.   Note, The first pair of cameras were recording again from the time he was last seen alive going into the gym. The second pair started recording again 6 minutes later. The gaps in footage aren't really in the window of interest, following when Kendrick enters the gym. If they started, rather than ended, when he goes missing, it would be a lot more suspicious.   What's certain, based on video from a camera outside the gym, is that numerous students walked into the gym during the hour and five minutes that the cameras weren't recording, but it's not clear whether that was sufficient to activate the cameras' motion sensors.   There were students all over during that time but no one reportedly saw or heard anything, so I'm not sure how much information the cameras could've provided.  I think the death was an accident, the school dragged their feet and the police, as is not unheard of, didn't do a thorough enough job investigating the death of a black kid.  The Johnsons' lawsuit is more about conspiracy mongering than substance too, so they don't seem to be able to provide a motive for foul play. Though I don't think they're trying to make a buck here, the sound like they feel their kid died on someone's watch so there is negligence to pay for by someone."

The inhabitants of one of the least explored islands on the planet are famous for being one of the last tribes untouched by civilization. North Sentinel Island continues to be one of the least known islands in the world and because of the aggressive tribe living on its territory, few people dare to study it.  Some observations show that the Sentinelese tribe consists mainly of hunter-gatherers, who obtain food mainly through hunting, fishing and the gathering of wild plants, growing on the island.  The Sentinelese don't use agriculture and have not mastered fire, similar to the African Aka tribe, which was believed to have been the only tribe that did not use fire.  Data received on the population of the Sentinelese people are not categorical but contradictory. The tribe is known for its great secrecy and during several attempts to count them, representatives of the Indian government prevented the researchers from doing their work.  At the moment, it can only be assumed that the primitive tribe consists of about 100 people, with the men numbering more than the women.  http://mysteries24.com/n3-49613-An_Unexplored_Island_is_Home_to_a_Mysterious_Tribe"

The way your hard drive works is that it has all the information as 1s and 0s, and has a register which lists where each block of information is located.  When you delete a file, all you're doing is deleting the entry from the register.  Over time, the portion of your hard drive that was pointed to by the register is overwritten with new information.  That is why you can occasionally recover deleted files, as long as you do it soon after deleting the file.  What CCleaner and your .exe file do is actually write random 1s and 0s everywhere on the hard drive as well as deleting everything from the register.  What I'm not sure about is why that has to occur multiple times."

In 1996, Peter Gutmann, a computer scientist, presented a paper that suggested overwritten data could be recovered through the use of magnetic force microscope.  In 2001, he presented another paper on a similar topic.  Substantial criticism has followed, primarily dealing with the lack of any concrete examples of significant amounts of overwritten data being recovered.  Although Gutmann's theory may be correct, there is no practical evidence that overwritten data can be recovered, while research has shown to support that overwritten data cannot be recovered.

Highway 82 in 1945, along with his parents as they traveled from Tulsa to Weatherford for the Christmas season.  Police believe John Doe and Joe Chandler III would have been about the same age, a contributing factor in John Doe's decision to become Joe Chandler. After Eastlake Police used dental records to verify the deceased John Doe was known as Joseph Chandler, they closed the case, listing it as a suicide.  The probate courts worked through his estate, which included an $82,000 legacy. They contacted Joe Chandler's relatives in the east, and discovered the real Joe Chandler died in the 1945 accident.  John Doe had used his alias at least since September 1978, when he wrote off for a copy of Joe Chandler III's birth certificate, and applied for his first Social Security Card, while he was in Rapid City, South Dakota. His dental records were made during the 23 year period he went by the alias.  John Doe shot himself in the head in his apartment using a .38-caliber Charter Arms handgun that had been purchased at a Western Auto store in Seagoville between 1968 and 1978. The store has been closed for some time and its records destroyed.

In 1978, he had requested a copy of Chandler’s birth certificate and used it to apply for a Social Security card. Many theories were formed about who this man really was. Crime buffs began to speculate that “Chandler” might have been the Zodiac Killer since he bore a resemblance to the suspect’s composite sketch. They also noted that “Joseph Chandler” happened to be the name of an investigator who found one of Jack the Ripper’s victims. The man also bore a striking resemblance to Stephen Craig Campbell, a fugitive who had been wanted for attempted murder since 1982 and was never caught. However, there is no conclusive evidence to prove any of these theories, so no one knows the real story behind the man who stole the identity of Joseph Newton Chandler III.  http://listverse.com/2013/06/23/10-unsolved-mysteries-involving-unidentified-people/  http://crimeshadows.com/jondoe.htm"

UnexplainedPhotos,2f2vrd,AllHailTheCATS,2,Sun Aug 31 20:44:30 2014 UTC,Very good. Except that was in London and this was Wisconsin. And there's a distinct absence of flogging and/or battery of deceased equines. But it had already occured to me that it might be an illustration of  the aforementioned idiom.
UnexplainedPhotos,2f2vrd,well_here_I_am,5,Sun Aug 31 22:11:53 2014 UTC,"More info for those frustrated by paywalls on obscure town newspapers.   Jan Hildebrand column: At the risk of beating a dead horse ...   The Sheboygan County Historical Research Center has been inundated with calls and e-mails about the picture of the silk-hatted gentleman sitting on a dead horse in the middle of the street. The photograph apparently is making its way around the world via the Internet.  Calls from CNN and the BBC have sparked interest in everyone who sees the picture and various stories have been concocted as to what the photo shows.  Working with the center's copy of the original photograph, we have identified the buildings in the picture.  In the center of the picture, which one e-mailer identified as a gallows, is the Eighth Street bridge built in 1865.  On the left is a two-story structure that has been identified as being the Lake View House in 1871. John Messner was the proprietor.  In the 1875 city directory, it is still listed as the Lake View House. The 1884 directory has the building as the Evergreen City Hotel, P. Reuther proprietor. Around the turn of the century it became Jelenc's tavern. The area shown is now part of the roundabout at that location.  The wooden buildings north of the Lake View House are a part of the C. Reiss & Co. yards. Clemens Reiss was in business with Christian Eckhardt and Frederick Karste and they dealt in wood, coal and grains at the south end of the Eighth Street bridge.  To the left of the bridge and across the river is the Michael Winter Lumber Co. Winter established his company with Henry Klue circa 1867, and in 1870 he continued alone. The absence of railroad or streetcar tracks points to an early date of possibly 1871-72.  The horse is definitely dead, although some e-mailers point out it could be a trick horse. It is still wearing a bridle but no saddle is shown.  In 1867 the Common Council passed the first traffic regulations. It stated that ""any horses, mules, jackasses or swine running at large within the city may be impounded."" It also passed the first regulation for the driving of hackneys, coaches, cabs, drays and omnibuses in the city.  Another regulation states that any ""unsound beef, pork, fish, hides or skins of any kind, or any other articles found within the city … must be destroyed or buried … .""  There is a rope strung between two poles in front of the dead horse making it appear that the man is waiting for a wagon or dray to come and fetch the body. The rope alerts other drivers to the obstruction in the road.  There were at least three photographic studios in Sheboygan, two nearby on Pennsylvania Avenue and Eighth Street. One was David Hawkins and the other W. Morgenmeier. A third firm was Harmon and Manville. All are listed in the 1868 city directory.  In 1875 there were also three — Groh, Manville and Mallory and Morgenmeier. Anyone of these men could have taken the picture, which is unfortunately unmarked.  We shall never know the identity of the young man — that name is lost to time — but the incongruity of a man wearing a silk top hat sitting on a dead horse is too good to be kept a secret.  A big thank you to everyone who e-mailed or called about the photo and to the networks for picking up the story and spreading it around the globe. You can't buy publicity like that.

Most Pohnpeians are content to believe they used magic to fly them,” Mauricio told Smithsonian.

Numerous attempts at decipherment have been made, none successfully. Although some calendrical and what might prove to be genealogical information has been identified, not even these glyphs can actually be read. If rongorongo does prove to be writing and proves to be an independent invention, it would be one of very few independent inventions of writing in human history.[1]  Two dozen wooden objects bearing rongorongo inscriptions, some heavily weathered, burned, or otherwise damaged, were collected in the late 19th century and are now scattered in museums and private collections. None remain on Easter Island. The objects are mostly tablets shaped from irregular pieces of wood, sometimes driftwood, but include a chieftain's staff, a bird-man statuette, and two reimiro ornaments. There are also a few petroglyphs which may include short rongorongo inscriptions. Oral history suggests that only a small elite was ever literate and that the tablets were sacred.  Authentic rongorongo texts are written in alternating directions, a system called reverse boustrophedon. In a third of the tablets, the lines of text are inscribed in shallow fluting carved into the wood. The glyphs themselves are outlines of human, animal, plant, artifact and geometric forms. Many of the human and animal figures, such as glyphs 200 Glyph 200 and 280 Glyph 280, have characteristic protuberances on each side of the head, possibly representing ears or eyes.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rongorongo"

UnexplainedPhotos,2f14bo,sir_tufton_beamish,6,Sun Aug 31 02:04:56 2014 UTC,"Rongorongo is fascinating because nobody has really got anywhere with it. Only isolated words have even been guessed at, apart from one segment which is believed to be a calendar, and basics such as a list of symbols with corresponding syllables don't exist. In addition it appears to have the same trap as Chinese - a few of the symbols look like something physical but (almost certainly) don't correspond to it. This is all the more surprising because it must be a Polynesian language - it is geographically isolated and there are no competing language families.

I am positive that he isn't lying, so that rules out #3   No, with all due respect, it does not rule out #3. Its great to get a character reference from the photographer's friend but it does not definitively rule out the possibility of #3. You could be in on the hoax with him for the money ;). But probably not haha.  I believe you when you say that he wouldn't make it up. So I am going to change my answer to #2.   He simply didn't notice the man behind him. Possibly due to the odd terrain, blind spots created when looking through a camera viewfinder or looking at a digital screen, and because he was concentrated on one task (taking pictures) to fully register the man beyond him.    I suppose #2 is possible, but I strongly doubt it, having spoken with him.   Why? What did he say?"
UnexplainedPhotos,2exq5i,Obiaruf,2,Tue Sep 9 01:21:21 2014 UTC,"Hey, cheers for following up -- because really, I just want to get to the bottom of this (although I fear I never will).   ""No, with all due respect, it does not rule out #3. Its great to get a character reference...""  Yeah, I hear ya -- I don't expect that to rule out anything for anyone here. If I were in your shoes, I'd still be skeptical. But for ME personally, I can rule it out, because this guy couldn't lie to me if he tried.  ""Why? What did he say?""  Basically, he wouldn't have snapped the pic if someone had been there. The whole point was to get a nice shot of his daughter -- he didn't want other people in the frame.   I appreciate the skepticism of ""maybe he didn't notice,"" but no, because he simply WOULD HAVE noticed someone there, especially someone dressed like that. And I see the fear in his eyes -- he is wigged out. Plus, this was taken on a smartphone -- he wasn't distracted looking through a small lens. He was holding the phone in front of him, in the way that anyone taking a smartphone shot would hold it. He'd have noticed someone in the frame. In fact, he didn't even notice the person in the photo after the fact -- his wife did, after he'd sent them to her by email while he and his daughter took the train back home (cue people saying ""see! So he just didn't notice when he took the pic!). No -- there was nobody in that distinctive manner of dress around him.    I appreciate the skepticism, and people suggesting that he is either lying or didn't see the person -- on the basis that those would be the most logical explanations -- but the latter, the ""selective ignorance"" theory pushed here by some, or whatever it's called, simply seems implausible to me, given the facts.   All of those pics were taken in the space of about a minute. Like I said, I'm not claiming ""ghost,"" (I now regret posting it to /r/Ghosts first -- I'm a Reddit newbie and now wish I'd solely posted it here), I'm just saying that I don't know what the f&ck this is and none of them common theories here wash with me at all. Y'all seem to be grasping at straws for a legit explanation (understandable as y'all do not know me or the photographer) but nothing that has been floated here really cuts the mustard, frankly. I am baffled and freaked out. Period."
UnexplainedPhotos,2exq5i,mlmayo,2,Tue Sep 9 04:41:10 2014 UTC,"And I see the fear in his eyes -- he is wigged out.   Hmm. Is he alright mentally? I don't really know much about these things but if he is legitimately frightened and acting weird then maybe it might be something else that is bothering him?  There is really nothing weird about that picture. it's a little odd how the person is obscured and the photographer doesn't remember the person.   To me it looks like a police officer on brake looking at the sea. I also think it is a police officer because there is a police station very close by to the location where the picture was taken and also because the boots and colors seem to match. I suspect that the police officer or person in uniform came climbing up the rocks to that grassy part.   Since the officer was directly behind the girl the photographer had no way of seeing him. Think about it. If you were taking that picture with a phone, the girl would be about 1.5cm tall on the screen. There is really no way to notice the person behind the girl when looking through a small screen. Then the officer probably noticed him taking picture and simply jumped down to the rocks down the beach, unseen, like a ninja."

UnexplainedPhotos,2exq5i,Obiaruf,2,Sat Aug 30 18:29:43 2014 UTC,"OP of the original photo here. I suppose there is no way I will convince anyone here that there was nobody behind the girl, and blahblahblah selective memory, but I know the photographer well and I am positive nobody was there. Plus I have seen the time stamps on the other photos and they are all within seconds of each other. In other words, I am fairly positive nobody was there> I appreciate and welcome your skepticism, but no."

The front of the boot looks like it does not line up with the back in a normal way, especially considering the figure was standing on a sloped surface. The front of the foot would be going down with the surface, not the center, unless the figure is just really good at keeping his foot straight."

UnexplainedPhotos,2ess64,zaphodi,30,Fri Aug 29 12:16:41 2014 UTC,"info;  Most people know about Nazca Lines  however another, less known,  unexplained mystery in Peru is located near Pisco Valley on a plain called Cajamarquilla. Thousands of man-sized holes are carved into the barren rock.  These strange holes, stretching for a mile over uneven mountain terrain, were here for so long that the local people have no idea who made them, or why. Funny thing is no one really saw the big picture until the area was seen from the air.    Archeologists have speculated they were dug to store grain in. Two problems with this, say the folks thinking out of the box:  there were a lot easier ways to create storage containers than the hard work and decades it must have taken to chip out all of these, and it would have made more sense, if these were to store grain, to build several huge chambers. Ok, said the archeologists.  Perhaps they were used as one-person tombs? Vertical graves of  some sort? But no bones, artifacts, scraps, inscriptions, jewelry...not even a tooth or strand of hair has been found in them. They have no covers to seal them as you might a tomb and no sacred history or even myth was passed down to label them as such.    Some sections have holes in rigid and perfect precision; some run in rows that curve up in arches, some staggered lines. They vary in depth to about 6-7 feet deep yet some are merely shallow indents as if not completed - though surrounded by those that are.  To date, no one has a clue why they're here, who made them or what they were.  http://www.world-mysteries.com/mpl_piscovalley.htm  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_of_Holes"
UnexplainedPhotos,2ess64,C0lMustard,5,Fri Aug 29 16:23:38 2014 UTC,"Band of Holes:       Band of Holes is the name given to a series of thousands of uniform holes found in the Pisco Valley on the Nazca Plateau in Peru. The holes themselves lie between 13°42′59.9″S 75°52′28.46″W﻿ / ﻿13.716639°S 75.8745722°W﻿ / -13.716639; -75.8745722 and 13°42′20″S 75°52′28.46″W﻿ / ﻿13.70556°S 75.8745722°W﻿ / -13.70556; -75.8745722 extending for several miles in a basically north-south orientation over uneven mountain surfaces. The highly organized grouping of holes range in size from a yard (a meter) to as much as 20 to 30 ft (6.1 to 9.1 m) in diameter and vary in depth from a few inches to 6 to 7 ft (180 to 210 cm).  The holes are on the same plateau as the Nazca Lines, but exhibit a different construction style.

The mysterious artifact from Indus-Saraswati civilization dates back to 2700 B.C.  The absence of data concerning the object's archaeological context makes it difficult to determine its true origin and purpose. The artifact was first studied by Massimo Vidale, an Italian archaeologist who came across it more or less by accident.  ""In Autumn 2009, I was invited by a private collector to see an artefact that was mentioned as unique and very complex, and reportedly belonged to the cultural sphere of the Indus civilization.  I do not have professional links with the antique market and the world of private collectors, but the descriptions I had of the find were so puzzling that for once I accepted the invitation to examine the new find. I was generously hosted by the family of the collector and what I saw fully rewarded the trip and the time.  There I spend two whole days, looking in detail to the most amazing and better preserved terracotta group sculpture of the 3rd millennium I had ever seen.  In this case the find is so exceptional, and its archaeological and historical implications so important, that to bury forever the information in the shelves of a private collector would only add damage to damage, "" Massimo Vidale said.  http://www.messagetoeagle.com/ladyspikethrone.php#.U_1M87Ls5GY  http://a.harappa.com/content/lady-spiked-throne"

UnexplainedPhotos,2e979u,kellysheros,7,Sun Oct 19 19:10:49 2014 UTC,"info;  NASA’s Curiosity rover has spotted a ""thigh bone"" on Mars -- or at least that’s what some paranormal types would have you believe. The folks at UFO Blogger wrote this week that the rover’s MastCam had captured a photograph of a ""fossilized thigh bone"" on the red planet on August 14.  The object certainly resembles a fossilized femur, but the odds that it's anything other than a weird-looking rock are, well, astronomical.  Over the years, people eyeing pictures from Mars have claimed to have seen everything from an iguana to a finger to weird faces. But NASA hasn't been too impressed.  ""On Mars, as on Earth, sometimes things can take on an unusual appearance,"" NASA wrote on its website last year after a strange, ""shiny"" object was spotted on the Martian surface.  NASA said at the time that while the ""shiny-looking rock"" resembled a car door handle or another metallic object, its actual identity was probably a bit more prosaic. As Ron Sletten, a scientist on the Curiosity team, indicated on the agency's site, ""the object is an interesting study in how wind and the natural elements cause erosion and other effects on various types of rocks.""  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/21/thigh-bone-mars-curiosity-rover_n_5697912.html  http://mars.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=0719MR0030550060402769E01_DXXX&s=719"

UnexplainedPhotos,2dxxh4,blitzballer,9,Tue Aug 19 01:47:35 2014 UTC,"info;  To this day, despite extensive research and exploration, nobody is really sure what happened to the town of Gedi and its peoples. This once great civilization was a powerful and complex Swahili settlement with a population of over 2500, built during the 13th century. The ruins of Gedi include many houses, mansions, mosques and elaborate tombs and cemeteries.  Despite the size and complexity of this large (at least 45 acre) settlement, it is never mentioned in any historic writings or local recorded history.   The nearby Portuguese settlement at Malindi seems to have had no contact with, or even known of the existence of Gedi.   The town has all the appearances of a trading outpost, yet its position, deep in a forest and away from the sea makes it an unlikely trading centre. What was Gedi trading, and with whom?  But the greatest of all of Gedi's mysteries was its sudden and inexplicable desertion in the 17th century.   The entire town was suddenly abandoned by all of its residents, leaving it to ruination in the forest. There are no signs of battle, plague, disturbance or any cause for this sudden desertion.  One current theory is that the town was threatened by the approach of the Galla, an inland tribe known to be outwardly hostile at that time, and that the townspeople fled ahead of their arrival.   Yet once again, local recorded history fails to mention any such large scale evacuation at this time. No written account of either the rise or sudden fall of Gedi was ever made.  The ghostly ruins of Gedi lay within the forest that has overgrown and consumed the town. They had become a part of local folklore, regarded as a sinister lair of malevolent spirits, until archaeologists began to uncover the site in the 20th century. It was gazetted in 1948.  http://www.magicalkenya.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=224&Itemid=262  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruins_of_Gedi  http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gedi-ruins"
UnexplainedPhotos,2dxxh4,autowikibot,3,Tue Aug 19 01:48:34 2014 UTC,"Ruins of Gedi:       The Ruins of Gedi are the remains of a Swahili town located in Gedi, a village near the coastal town of Malindi in Kenya.   From the 13th or 14th to 17th centuries, Gedi was a thriving community along the jungle coast of East Africa. Although no written record exists of this town, excavations between 1948 and 1958 revealed that the Muslim inhabitants traded with people from all over the world. Some of the findings included beads from Venice, coins and a Ming vase from China, an iron lamp from India, and scissors from Spain. The population was estimated to exceed at least 2500 people. These items can be found in the museum in the complex which was opened in 2000.  Gedi had a mosque, a palace, and large stone houses. These houses were complex for their time, with bathrooms with drains and overhead basins to flush toilets. The city's streets were laid out at right angles and had drainage gutters. There are also wells which supplied water to the community. The material used to construct the buildings was made from coral reef from the nearby ocean.

The picture featured in the submission is a cropped close-up of the original picture you can find from the original source here. You can see roadway and exit signs in the picture indicating that it was taken on a highway, most likely inside of a moving car. Now I can't demonstrate it well but do you know how when driving at night, the lights coming in the window on one side of your car will show up as reflections on the windows of the other side, making it look like there are lights in the sky? I think that is what is happening here. Now the streetlights lining highways in Houston look like this. Notice a similarity to OP's photo if you think about it being at a different angle? They have twelve bulbs and the original picture has twelve lights as well.  Given the car driving the same direction on his side of the highway and the exit signs on the other side of the highway being readable to him, it looks like he pointed his smartphone at the storm clouds behind him and snapped a pic, with the windows rolled up.

It has been the subject of legend and rumor, and the circumstances surrounding its construction and its builder are considered miraculous by the Sisters of Loretto and many visitors  The Sisters of Loretto relate the story as follows:  Needing a way to get up to the choir loft the nuns prayed for St. Joseph's intercession for nine straight days. On the day after their novena ended a shabby-looking stranger appeared at their door. He told the nuns he would build them a staircase but that he needed total privacy and locked himself in the chapel for three months. He used a small number of primitive tools including a square, a saw and some warm water and constructed a spiral staircase entirely of non-native wood. The identity of the carpenter is not known for as soon as the staircase was finally finished he was gone. Many witnesses, upon seeing the staircase, feel it was constructed by St. Joseph himself, as a miraculous occurrence.  The resulting staircase is an impressive work of carpentry. It ascends twenty feet, making two complete revolutions up to the choir loft without the use of nails or apparent center support. It has been surmised that the central spiral of the staircase is narrow enough to serve as a central beam. Nonetheless there was no attachment unto any wall or pole in the original stairway, although in 1887 -- 10 years after it was built -- a railing was added and the outer spiral was fastened to an adjacent pillar. Instead of metal nails, the staircase was constructed using dowels or wooden pegs.  The legend claims that the mystery had never been satisfactorily solved as to who the carpenter was or where he got his lumber, and that there were no reports of anyone seeing lumber delivered or even seeing the man come and go while the construction was being done. Since he left before the Mother Superior could pay him, the Sisters of Loretto offered a reward for the identity of the man, but it was never claimed.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loretto_Chapel"

UnexplainedPhotos,2dan54,SecretTargBastard,5,Tue Aug 12 02:25:57 2014 UTC,"My father lives just across I44 from the spook road. It does not stay confined to just one road. The damn thing followed us home one time, on down a dirt road that parallels the interstate, until we turned on his road and it stayed its heavenly course. This might seem to support the headlight theories spouted in this thread, but there's no explanation for things I've heard and even felt out there. Past the end of that same road where he lives, over the gate, across an old wagon trail (littered with arrowheads and half disintegrated cookpots and a mattress frame that a mature tree has grown through) there's a small cemetary that is reported to have a witch's grave. Being out there at night, I feel as if I'm one of few men who have dared to be there past dark in a hundred years, and i can't help but to feel as if my presence is barely being tolerated. It's as if my family has a tentative lease on our land there, and it actually belongs to older things. I've never seen anything out there in the superstitious vein besides the spook light, to be sure, but just as assuredly I have heard things: metallic screeches that have no business so far from people and so late at night. It put my girlfriend to crying and me scampering inside for a gun. When I came back out, I followed the sound as it shrunk into the woods down the wagon trail.  My father is half mad and claims to be haunted by some two dozen ghosts out there. The whole area of devil's promenade is littered with landmarks bearing the devils name or signature of fire... The devil's biscuits, the devil's promenade itself (when the Quapaws were forcibly removed to this place, they saw the devil promenading on a high bluff across the water, and many drowned as they tried to ford the river there), the Hoffman mansion that burned down after the inhabitants died, like so many other houses in this area which seems to relish a good fire. Little people's bridge, which is in devil's hollow, said to be watched over by what Indians call little people and what my loon father calls tree people, always thieving from his property. I have come across apparent animal sacrifices in devil's hollow, near the mansion, once on Friday the 13th nonetheless.  In this corner of the state in the in the Ozark foothills, you are not welcome. If my father doesn't scare you off, the witch will curse you from hell, the little people will harry you and steal off with your property, the spook light will spook you, ghost wagons will make you piss yourself... If you're even more unfortunate you might cross paths with the devil himself, dancing between the Spring river and the desecrated graveyard at the burnt ruins of the mansion."
UnexplainedPhotos,2dan54,autowikibot,2,Sun Aug 31 06:22:36 2014 UTC,"info;  Despite the fact that it is named after a small, unincorporated community in Missouri from which it is most commonly accessed, the light is most commonly described as being visible from inside the Oklahoma border looking to the west. The Spooklight is commonly described as a single ball of light or a tight grouping of lights that is said to appear in the area regularly, usually at night. Although the description of the light is similar to that of other visual phenomena witnessed throughout the world, the term ""Spooklight"" when standing alone generally refers to this specific case. Numerous legends exist that attempt to describe the origin of the Spooklight, one of which involves the ghosts of two young Native American lovers looking for each other  Explanations for the light's appearance vary widely from the extraordinary to the mundane. The area of Oklahoma in which the light is seen is very hilly and forested and out to the west of where the light is seen lies Interstate 44. It has been suggested that the headlights of cars seen over the hills explain the light's appearance, which is sometimes said to bob up and down, dance, or even split into multiple globules of light. In William Least Heat-Moon's 2008 book Roads to Quoz, the author suggests that the lights seen at the end of E 50 are explained perfectly by the fact that the road aligns directly with Route 66 across the interstate and the river valley, some ten miles distant. He also claims that earlier sightings of the light from E 40 Road, one block to the north, are explained by an earlier alignment of Route 66 to the north of the town of Quapaw, Oklahoma, and also aligned with E 40 Road. The author suggests that there are no reliable sightings of the light in any location but directly west along the road and therefore explainable by the Route 66 connection.  One legend details an old, lost miner and the spooklight is actually his lantern. This explanation results from the Spooklight being situated in an area with a past of intense lead and zinc mining in Southwest Missouri and Northeast Oklahoma.  However, most people prefer to state that they cannot explain the almost nightly appearance of mysterious lights in the area, and descriptions of the lights date back to an era prior to the highway's construction. Other explanations for the light's appearance includes atmospheric gases being affected by electrical fields. A University of Arkansas professor studied the light in the 1960s and suggested that it was from a fixed object.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spooklight"
