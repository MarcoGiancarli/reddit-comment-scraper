As for 2000 and later, I'll second the Mass Effect suggestion and add on a nod to the Knights of the Old Republic series. Same company, came out a few years prior to ME1. Also, Kotor 2 is on sale on steam for like $8 right now. Wasn't developed by Bioware but still a good game.   If you have a PS3, I've heard great things about Ni No Kuni. Rpg that was done in collaboration with the studio that did that Spirited Away movie. Really cool looking art style but I've never played it so I can't say much else.   If you have a 3ds, they did a Zelda game that's kind-of-but-not-really a link to the past remake called A Link Between Worlds.  Never finished it but it but what I played was quite enjoyable."

Once you decide ""I'm going to play this game"", forget all about it until release date (and a few patches in, as is now customary). There are plenty of other games in the meantime, there is no point in thinking about this one in particular. The more you try to imagine it, the more perfect image you create in your head. And odds are, it will be not what you expect, for better or (likely) for worse. So the more you think about it, the more disappointment you will get. Why bother with it? Play something else in the meanwhile."

If you don't feel like learning the fighting system, mashing buttons with some friends is still a lot of fun. My general rule is just don't look at any gameplay and immediately buy it. If i'm not confident in a purchase, i just look at the discounts and buy cheaper games. Turns every game into something new and exciting, definitely recommend this method."

It's a blast when you're scoring goals and your team is cooperating but it can be very frustrating if you're losing or have sabotaging teammates. Hitting the ball the right way and timing jumps to be able to intercept the ball takes getting used to for sure so there's replayability in trying to master the game, and you'll also unlock things with each completed match.

You can also play online or against AI bots if you want. If anything its really addicting Cu each match is only 5 minutes.  Edit: I was skeptical on the fun for the price and time but I'm glad I bought it. I consider myself a patient gamer too waiting for good deals on games so I think $20 is a good price.

In fact, if you pre-order Zestiria, you can help to unlock a free copy of Vesperia for all Zestiria pre-orderers when it's released! Did that last sentence make sense? haha  Though I'm sure you HAVE looked into JRPGs for PC (it's a popular theme in this sub) I'll assume ignorance and suggest that you check out Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky. Besides the obvious Final Fantasy options, it's the most robust PC JRPG that I can think of.  I've also heard good things about the Aveyond series, but haven't played any of them yet though I keep meaning to. They're indie games and I believe all 4 ""chapters"" have now been released.   Some people recommend the Agarest series, but I couldn't get into it myself; the combat was just too repetitive and annoying for me - but to each their own!  Anyways - hope you find something fun! And don't forget - you can always emulate the classics!"
AskGames,3dlq19,TheHemogoblin,2,Fri Jul 17 16:19:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the awesome reply!  I have gone through quite a few JRPGs over the years, most of the major console games I've played; Final Fantasy/ Tales of etc, I've even played Zesteria (I'm a big import gamer, just recently finished Digimon Cyber Sleuth as well), Zesteria's new battle system didn't quite feel right to me but the game was still fun.. I like to play JRPGs and do videos on what I think of them.  Legend of Heroes is one of the PC games I've played because it would run on my laptop.. pretty sure I first found that from the PSP and was shocked to see a PC version.  I've not tried Aveyond of Agarest so I'll add them to my list to try..   I've not played any Valkyrie Profile outside of the original, though I own Silmaria..

AskGames,3d9tpo,SuiXi3D,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:54:27 2015 UTC,"1) I understand Xbox One has privacy settings, but how does it work, for example, can I set it so that no one can message me or contact me in any way besides friends I've added?   While I'm not sure on the specifics (mainly because I don't have to use them) but I've heard that the privacy and parental controls are amazing on the Xbox One.   2) How customizable is the UI?   You're able to set custom wallpapers, or grab images from unlocked Achievements. You're also able to change the color and transparency of the tiles, and are asked to do so when you first create your profile.   3) I'm hearing about a Windows 10 Update in a short bit, what exactly will this all change for the Xbox One?   The big one is the UI. There's some videos floating around of what you can expect from that, but in general the idea is for them to clean up and speed up the UI. The other big deal is that it's going to integrate with the PC version of Windows 10, allowing you to stream games from your Xbox One to your PC. I'm sure some preview members can give you a better idea as to what you can expect.   4) Has the Master Chief Collection been fixed? Primarily the co-op and campaign, also do all 4 games have co-op online?   Personally, those particular elements of the game worked flawlessly for my wife and I, running on two different Xbox Ones. All four games can be played online, co-op and competitive modes being generally as they were when the games were originally released. Don't get me wrong, there are still issues with the matchmaking multiplayer, but co-op works wonderfully in my case.   5) How is the default Internet browser?   Based on my limited usage, surprisingly not terrible. If you've got a smartphone or tablet, you can use it to control the cursor with the Smartglass app. It works pretty well but at the end of the day, you're probably better off using the phone or tablet you're using to control it.   6) Is there any way to Gameshare?   Kind of. It's limited. You're able to set an Xbox to be a 'home' Xbox, and anyone that plays on that console can access any games or DLC you've purchased on that console. In addition, you can add an account to your 'family', and by doing so all your purchases are shared with that account. Upon adding a third or more accounts to your family, only the first 'extra' account can access your purchased games and DLC. My wife and I use this feature a lot, as I'll buy a game and she can play it on her console, and we're able to play multiplayer as if she had bought her own copy. It's awesome because it means we don't have to buy two copies of a game to play on both consoles.   7) Are there any region locks, fpr example if my friend is from Argentina and I'm Canadian, can.we still voice chat, video chat, game together etc etc.   I'm unsure, but the Skype app on the Xbox One works wonderfully if you're unable to chat normally."

(Playable Teaser) is a first-person survival horror video game directed by Hideo Kojima, developed by Kojima Productions, and published by Konami. Released for the PlayStation 4 on 12 August 2014 as a free download on the PlayStation Network, P.T. serves as an interactive teaser for the game Silent Hills, a now-cancelled installment in the Silent Hill series. In P.T., the player explores a looping corridor of a haunted house while experiencing supernatural events.  P.T. was met with a positive critical reception. It was praised for its horror and the execution of the looping corridor, but was criticized for its complicated puzzles. After the cancellation of Silent Hills, Konami removed P.T. from the PlayStation Store and eliminated the ability to re-download the game. These changes were the subject of significant controversy.    Image i     Relevant: Fox Engine | Silent Hills | Peter Demos   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

AskGames,3d6dbp,Kattycake,2,Mon Jul 13 21:44:34 2015 UTC,"While this is gameplay-wise completely off from what you're sort of looking for, I feel that King of Dragon Pass manages the ""feel"" of tribal survival in a sort of pre-technological era. Admittedly KoDP is set in Glorantha, which is quite a fantastic world of monsters, spirits, myths, ghosts, gods and fae (and of course dragons), but it really does capture the idea of ""our crops failed this year, and our neighbours pillaged so-and-so many heads of cattle - what are we doing to do?""  KoDP is also rooted in the ""fearful peasant""-level of view, and while you do commit to some heroic works, it's mostly on the levels of ""heroic cattle-raids between feuding clans"", with the occasional ritualistic spirit-journey to re-create some-or-other mythical deeds of the gods. But mostly your clansmen will indeed (and should indeed) be scared shitless whenever something unusually supernatural or strange occurs.  Admittedly, KoDP is essentially a roleplaying game (and a somewhat linear-ish one, though with mostly random encounters plus a ""core quest-line"") disguised as a management game, but I at least get a kick out of immersing myself in the goings-on of my clan, and fiddling about with both basic survival as well as ambitious power-grabs among the clans.  Plus, the audiovisual style is amazing and quite singular."

One thing the game does well is make you think that you're good at the game while playing casually as you can just run round killing bots. Meaning that it is almost always fun without feeling frustrated while playing even when your team loses.  And all this is without even mentioning the mech combat. It is so fun while still balanced in the game, and if you don't like controlling the mech, you can just set it to auto pilot and it will do its own thing. My personal favourite thing to do in the mech is to have auto eject and nuclear explosion, so you run in and start punching the shot out of another mech and even if you lose the fight, you'll be automatically ejected and his mech will probably be killed in the blast  Overall, this is by far the most fun I've had in an FPS and would highly recommend it to anyone"

A simple fact you'll have to get used to if you decide to play Monster Hunter is that committing to an attack will always be potentially dangerous. You can't escape that. It's just in the nature of the game. You will never be able to run in swinging and get away with it. You have to understand your weapons' movesets thoroughly, or you will be punished for it.

You want to try and prioritize things on routes, like get everything you can get done in one route. Basically just try to plan your route so you have as little backtracking as possible.

And a couple of months ago I made my first build completely from the ground up. And frankly, it's easier than you would expect.    Yes it is going to take a couple of hours collecting information on how to build a PC and what parts to get, Though there are plenty of subreddits here that would be glad to help you pick out some parts that are compatible with eachother. (Though with building PC's, almost everything is compatible.) And yes the building is going to take a couple of hours, and that's not including installing the software. But in the end, you'll spend a day saving about 200 to 300 bucks. Well ok you didn't save anything, but you spend that money on getting better equipment for your PC, but in the end you'll still save money because you won't have to upgrade your PC that quickly.    Of course there are risks, but educate yourself properly and most of these risks are completely gone.    Plus you've learned a new skill, and will be able to maintain your PC better, knowing what does what. If something breaks down you'll be able to spot the problem immediately and fix it within a day. Whereas PC shops tend to overprice you for it, and take days if not weeks to fix.    And even if you still are scared shitless, It's always cheaper to get the parts yourself, and finding someone else (a friend) or some place (A PC shop) to build it for you. And hey maybe they are willing to educate you on building it.    But TL;DNR. Building your own PC, It's easy (After learning for a couple of hours) It's cheaper in every single way.

It's totally possible that you can get everything assembled and running with just the OS: if you're running Windows 8 or 10, many common wireless receivers already have compat drivers installed. From there, many actual parts now have Java applet support: for instance, nVidia cards will allow you to navigate to the nVidia website, hit ""upgrade drivers"", and the site will do the rest for you. As non sarcastically as possible: it's really not that hard.   2) I will bet you real money that there is not a pre-built website you can go to that won't rip you blind. Some are good, but will still tack on, eh, $150 on average for assembly. Then there are the ridiculous charges: I've seen a website charge $100 to overclock a K-series processor...tjeyre literally designed to be overclocked.

That cost me about $80, but even then I still saved a ton of money by not buying pre-built. After that it worked like a dream.

AskGames,3cty44,Whitezu,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:28:19 2015 UTC,"One thing that GameStop does that is quite strange is limit most variations to one sku. In other words, someone brings in a standard release and gets $5, and someone brings in the super-rare-exclusive-pre-order-only ultimate edition and they also get $5 because it's the same game. In some cases this makes sense because the bonus content is a code that's been used, but many times I've found something pretty rare for the price of a standard edition. Good for the consumer, bad for those trading in. They also do this for most accessories. Whether it's the headset that comes with your system or a high dollar turtle beach set, you'll get the same price.   I guess this is only something to think about depending on how your website is set up. If people choose titles from a list/menu you might want to include an other option for all of the possible variations that would be hard to keep track of, and then they could be reviewed. If it's just a place for people to connect I suppose this would take care of itself."

In order for your business to be a success, to survive against gamefly is to facilitate trading. You have to supply shipping paid cover slips for people to exchange goods. You can have a tiered subscription model that will allow games to be tested before trading, or a higher percentage of trading games in.

AskGames,3cswdp,shiram,3,Fri Jul 10 14:44:05 2015 UTC,"Get The Witcher III. Dragon Age isn't even a real comparison except that they both happen to be high-fantasy third-person adventure RPGs. It is a VAST game that is extremely well done; I don't buy into hype for games, but I have to admit that I believe CD Projekt Red has set the current standard for free-roam RPGs. My only complaint is that the camera can be a bit wonky at times, but everything else is great. You'll definitely get your money's worth.  If you're into something multiplayer, I know you said you'd prefer avoiding online play, but I have to say I've been surprised by Elder Scrolls Online. It doesn't have a monthly fee, and is a lot better than what all the horrible reviews and opinions I've read would lead me to believe. It's basically like a simplified Skyrim with multiplayer, though I've been able to play pretty much solo for a couple of weeks now. I've grouped up for a few of the harder dungeons a few times, and done a few quests with friends, but the rest of the time I've been playing like most other Elder Scrolls games. I'm really not sure why there's such hate for it (though I've admittedly not looked much into what was promised vs. what was delivered, so that might be part of it.)"

We are following all 'stories' But whenever we feel like it, or someone isn't around at that time, we'll get a different map, or do some mutation or versus play.  Has the perfect round structure you want, doesn't feature character levels. Replayability is mainly just doing the same levels over and over again. But the game has a good RNG system that moves around the little details each time you start a round. Even between dying things can be a little bit different.    ALso luke u/Neoky said Saints row 3 is a great game to do in co-op. Been doing that with a friend too. Generally just hop in, play a bit and leave again.    And also just generally Grand Theft Auto Online. If that is your cup of tea. Me and my collegues have been enjoying this so far. Even if everyone is a completely different level you can just join. Do a quick mission or 2, and with the massive amounts on content you can keep on playing.  Even player skill doesn't really matter.  It has co-op in form of missions or the popular Heists. Or just competitive gameplay. Even the open world shenanigans can create for endless fun."

Wanderlust: Rebirth is plays like a snes zelda game with an RPG system and classes. 4-p, though levels may become a burden.  There is of course Payday 2.  Monaco is a 4-p stealth game with various character types each with their own ability to beat the stage. It's great when you can get everyone to work together."

Is there a different issue you have with MMOs besides this? GW2 satisfies all your points except gameplay isn't divided into rounds: co-op, players of higher levels are scaled down to that of the area they're currently in, and there is plenty of motivation to keep playing. Additionally, it is very possible to hop online, go do a couple quests, then log off, and since you can have plenty of different characters you can all agree that you will have certain characters that you will only play on as a group, so that no one gets way ahead of anyone else."

The combat is very much similar to the Mass Effect games.    Vindictus has a similar setup but different theme, and it's more hack 'n' slashey and less shootey. Huge update coming next week, would be a good chance to try it out.    Both games consist only of instance-based dungeons (and raids for Vind), so there's a good stopping point after any run. Vindictus is more high-low level mix friendly than Warframe. You can get AP (to level skills) from battles, so there's always an incentive to go back and help lower-level players with quests and such."

Personally, the Xenosaga series are some of my favorite games, pulling from Judaism (the main artifact in the game is called the Zohar, which is also a book of Jewish mysticism focusing on the Kabbalah), Gnosticism (the main antagonists are creatures known as the 'Gnosis,') and several other philosophies (especially Nietzsche; the games are titled after his books - Episode I is Der Wille zur Macht, The Will to Power.)   Highly recommended, if you have a PS2 or 3.   Xenogears is on the PS1 and is equally good with similar concepts, and Xenoblade Chronicles is one of the best games on the Wii but isn't quite as heavy-handed with its references."

You mention disliking P4G (my second favorite game ever) and thinking about monster hunter (which is difficult for me to call an RPG in the traditional sense), but what games have you already played in the genre that you liked?  I personally have both a 3DS and a Vita, but I spend much much more time on my Vita out of the two because I love JRPGs which it has a massive number. Not that I'm saying the 3DS doesn't have some great ones as well. It is just difficult to list ideas without more information on what you like in an RPG.  Basically do you enjoy final fantasy-style JRPGs, hack and slash, dungeon crawling, visual novel+gameplay ect.?  Also does the theme matter?

I can't honestly recommend the Vita unless you can pick it up for cheap. It's a powerful, beautiful system but unfortunately never really took off in the west and Sony has all but abandoned it.  As for games, it would be more helpful to maybe have a sampling of what titles or types of games you're into. I will say that Monster Hunter 4 is considered by most to be the best entry in the series yet. It's easily accessible to new players while still having challenges for long time veterans. You can easily dump hundreds of hours into it and still not be done with content, and that's apart from the monthly free DLC Capcom continues to release."

You have to wage price, mass, power consumption and space on your ship at all times managing your build.   As of yet the game is still young, so there isn't much of a meta, but once weapons have been balanced out, you can see differences in pulse or beam lasers for example, if everyone is going to wear shield banks, a beam would be a lot more useful to penetrate shields at once, while it is heavy and slow in charging.

Last of Us Remastered is a good choice then, if you don't actually have your PS3, though it's massively discounted all over the place because it's a bundle-in game.

If you don't want to start with an older one, such as Saints Row 2, at least start with 3. Saints Row 4 was good, but it wasn't as good as 3.

Also I'd like to add that personally I think playing FES at least once is worth it before P3P only because I think having the anime cutscenes and being able to explore in 3D in the main game world is nice once. You don't really need to control your own party even though they tend to be dumb sometimes (like not using AOE when they should) so I didn't really miss it after playing P4G prior to 3."

FO3 has an extraordinarily generic story (help your dad save the wasteland by purifying the water! or, you can be evil and put a virus in it!) while New Vegas's is much more complex and not nearly as limited, having no real ""good"" and ""evil"" choices, especially in the main story, where all four factions can be argued to have some merit, even the Legion. Well, there are definitely some evil choices, but take Helios One. Do you direct power to everyone, but only a little bit? Do you help NCR? Help the Followers/Kings? Help yourself with a badass solar powered weapon thing? Interesting options like that really weren't available in FO3.   Also, fuck yeah Caravan! Robbing Cliff Briscoe was never so easy."
AskGames,3bpo1s,simiansays,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:06:40 2015 UTC,"Fair call; I'm talking more about the genesis of the character in both which really affected my ability to empathize with my character's motivations. In FO3, I found the setup of finding out what the heck is going on, and where my father is, to be more personally compelling than ""I woke up in a ditch and vaguely want revenge on this guy who stole something I was transporting for a rich guy"". Definitely agree that the nuances of decisions are much greater in NV, but for me, the setup and motivations of the character felt more shallow than the character's in FO3.  They're both great games, but I didn't get into my character as much in NV as I did in FO3."

Why am I transporting the chip? Why did I get attacked? Who is Victor? How does he keep showing up? Is he the bad guy?"" Framing it as just waking up in a ditch and vaguely wanting revenge is unfair, as you don't even have to get revenge on him, you just want to know what the hell is going on.

""do I kill the slavers or work for them?"" ""do I detonate the bomb or defuse it?"" choices are more like ""do I shut down the reactor, killing the remaining inhabitants trapped inside the vault, or continue to let its radiation ruin the NCR's farms?"" along with the incredibly good struggle at the center of the game's story. NV had some cool extra features like reloading benches and weapon mods, as well as what I believe to be much better DLC with a great story arc that extended through all of them.

Skyrim has a bigger world, but New Vegas's vaults are far more interesting than ""bandit cave #25"" and the radiant quests, while they were a good idea, had terrible execution, so most of the side quests in the game end up being ""Fetch my sword/necklace/ring from this bandit/draugr infested shithole"" rather than actually interesting quests like in New Vegas. Also, New Vegas had an amazingly good multi-DLC story arc. I know it's hard, but don't look up spoilers for the DLC. Keep it a mystery.

The xbone can control your DVR, and the ps4 can't. The PS4 controller is also a lot more innovative with a touch pad, motion sensing, an internal speaker, and light on the back that will change colors depending on the situation. You wanna know the real reason I bought a ps4 instead of an xbone? Microsoft were absolute assholes about some of the restrictive features when it was first announced. Seriously, they were complete dicks about the ""always online"" restriction, and the fact that it wouldn't have play used games.

While console games, the games themselves are not that cheap, plus you can't really carry them over once the console era ends like the pc can, then you would have to worry about overheat deaths of consoles, not sure next gen has this problem or not, like the xbox360 had and ps3.  But meh you can go either way, which ever is easiest and you enjoy.  Better to go to a friends house or a retailer that has demos out so you can get the feel for the consoles, so you can form your own opinion as well. And research any exclusive only games for xbone or ps4 that you might* enjoy, Since both consoles might not offer that game, might only be available on other console or pc only.

AskGames,3bayrd,Dnaldon,2,Sat Jun 27 14:04:27 2015 UTC,"There aren't many grinding focused games out there that are singleplayer, mostly because most players hate grinding and only suffer it because of the promise of multiplayer, so right off the bat you're gonna have a bit of a hard time trying to find games like that.  The only game that I can think of that does all of what you're asking for would be a private WoW server set up to allow players to solo raid content, which is probably gonna be hard to find or set up for yourself.  But if you're looking for a game with diablo/dungeon defenders esque gear drops and singleplayer dungeons/raids, you might want to check out Borderlands 1/2. It's a first person shooter but is very focused on grinding and cool gear drops.  Another game you might be interested in is called The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot, but fair warning it is a pay to win game.  Spiral Knights might also be an option. It has a pretty good amount of gear drops, a pretty cool combat system, and a fuck ton of grinding.  Terraria could also fit that mold as a game with frequent gear upgrades and grinding as well as the ability to complete dungeons and raid bosses solo.  Orcs Must Die is a series that has a very similar presentation and idea as dungeon defenders, but with a more singleplayer/coop focus.  If you're looking for a more polished World of Warcraft styled MMO then Guild Wars 2 is probably a good investment.  That's all I can really think about off the top of my head.

AskGames,3b43bz,zimmerxp,12,Thu Jun 25 20:21:13 2015 UTC,Sometimes developers also tie game functions to the FPS. For example in Dark Souls II the weapon degradation rate was tied to the frame rate.
AskGames,3b43bz,Jeebitz,7,Thu Jun 25 20:34:56 2015 UTC,That's just programmers being lazy.
AskGames,3b43bz,bobbaluba,9,Fri Jun 26 06:26:17 2015 UTC,"If you aren't familiar with screen tearing, here is a picture.  http://i.stack.imgur.com/f2aE6.jpg  And capping FPS is generally done to match the TV.  For example, most TVs are 60 fps, but a game maybe only able to do 40 on console.  Well, the developers will cap the FPS at 30 because that prevents screen tearing, which is typically hated by most people.  Then they can push their graphics a little bit harder, so long as they don't go below 30.    This also applies to going over your screens refresh rate.  If you are getting 70 fps on a screen that runs at 60 hz, you'll still get tons of screen tearing.  So the idea of preventing screen tearing is universal - its just the numbers that change.  On PC this can still be a good feature to have, you just want to leave it to the user to configure it.  And some users might actually prefer 40 fps with screen tearing over 30 fps with no tearing."
AskGames,3b43bz,ha11ey,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:15:00 2015 UTC,"Why not use double buffering on pc? It's not either or, you can render full frames and still not cap framerate."
AskGames,3b43bz,bobbaluba,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:15:36 2015 UTC,"Double Buffering usually is only available with Vsync enabled, so you are going to get fps capped to the refresh rate of your monitor / tv. I heard that double buffering without vsync is not recommended at all because it introduces insane screen tearing.  Also Vsync introduces input lag on lots of games, so most people disable it."
AskGames,3b43bz,otarU,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:31:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but wouldn't vsync be the upper limit of your frame rate anyways? If you have a 120hz monitor, it's no reason to render 300fps.  most framerate caps are usually around 30-60 fps, and that's when people with 120 hz screens get annoyed and start complaining. The game shouldn't cap the framerate, vsync should."
AskGames,3b43bz,bobbaluba,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:43:37 2015 UTC,"Some games feel a lot better when you disable vsync / framerate cap even though you will have tears on the screen.   Games like Quake 3, Quake Live, Unreal Tournament, Counter Strike Global Offensive, Warsow, Quake 1, Counter Strike 1.6 they just feel and play a lot better the more fps you have.  It's not even a matter of the monitor being able to display that many frames, something on the engine of the game makes the game play differently if you have more fps. For example on Counter Strike 1.6 the hit detection system would work way better if you had more fps, also your weapon spread would be smoother.   On Quake 3 you can't even think about playing capped at 60 fps, you want to display the most recent frame everytime a frame is show on the screen and by playing at 300 fps, you minimize possibles sources of lag even if you don't display all those 300 frames on a second.  Competitive Fighting Games like Street Fighter, Blazblue, MvC are also games that you want to reduce the input lag the most possible. Enabling Vsync is the worst thing you can do because it holds frames before displaying them, causing unnecessary input lag."

AskGames,3b43bz,otarU,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:36:28 2015 UTC,"Also you know that vsync causes input lag right?  Think about it. If you have a 60hz monitor.  You will display 60 frames per second. So for it to be synced on vsync, you will need to display one entire frame every 16ms. Also this means that you have to render those frames before displaying them, causing additional input lag.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scAGnQJWWe0  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdluYhGSnHQ"
AskGames,3b43bz,otarU,3,Fri Jun 26 12:17:46 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to say what I remember about what a Dev once said.  There's a lot of work that needs to done, rendering wise, for each frame. Sometimes things can get screwed up, so you want to leave yourself a bit of a buffer time wise.  Because of the way TVs work, you often want 30 or 60 frames per second.  It's easier to try and get a certain amount of work done in a known time rather than to say ""execute as fast a possible"".  It makes some sense on a console, but perhaps less sense for a  PC."
AskGames,3b43bz,MegaZeusThor,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:31:35 2015 UTC,"It makes some sense on a console, but perhaps less sense for a PC.   As long as the PC owner has control, it's still a good thing to have around.  You just want to set it to match your monitors refresh rate to avoid tearing."
AskGames,3b43bz,ha11ey,3,Thu Jun 25 21:11:23 2015 UTC,some graphics cards can overheat when left to really overtune the fps. For instance you might be running a fairly old game at 300+ fps and your card will be running at full power. That's one reason to cap that I haven't seen mentioned yet.

AskGames,3b4uwx,xxninja666xx,3,Fri Jun 26 00:00:18 2015 UTC,"Is it the standard ""save the world o chosen one"" type of thing, or is it something different?   Well it kinda starts out that way, but it's not that straight forward. By the end (a bit too late if you ask me) it turns full 180 and the narrative is less about you and more about the world itself. That's the best I can do without any spoilers :D   Are there any meaningful choices throughout the game?   Yes.   Some choices alter faction affiliation and subsequently your path throughout the story Your aggregated choices get tallied up to your personality scores which are used at the end of the game for a few neat scenes. IMHO it has high replayability because of that.    If yes, are they in the morally gray area, or are they blatantly obvious good vs evil, like in Bioware's RPGs?   Lots of grey area all over the game. I'd say the default choice in PoE isn't good vs. evil and more liberty vs. order or small picture vs. big picture. Both of which are valid in their own right.   Please tell me as much as you can about the story and writing as you can without spoilers.    Your main character is ""special"", though not necessarily the chosen one. The world is very bleak. Post war. Hard choices. Different organisations struggling for power. The writing is very colorful and elaborate. Prepare to read a lot even though there is a shit ton of (very good) voice acting in the game. It's acts are ordered in a linear progression, though that usually doesn't lock you out of areas. So it's still pretty open. Some of the lore is stuck inside of kickstarter backer NPCs. You can ""talk"" to them and they tell you a short story. It adds so much to the world, but by how it is delivered within the context ... I don't like it that much?   If you do get it one piece of advice: Play on normal and don't min-max your social stats that much, and take all the story NPCs you can find (there are 6 or 7). They add a lot to the world by their reactions and interactions within the group."

I am usually a completionist type gamer and would go do all of the side missions and exploring and stuff.  But after playing all of the other AC games before it, I couldn't really bring myself to care to do anything in this game outside of the main story missions.  Once I got to the last couple memory sequences I just wanted to beat the game for the sake of beating it at that point.  I saw the credits roll after the last mission and shut it off and never played it again.    Some of the new gameplay gimmicks were cool, and the main missions aren't too bad now that they give you a lot of freedom to execute your assassinations with more freedom and choose your path to your target.  But I think I was just too burnt out after playing all the other games because this one is so incredibly similar to the previous 2 or 3 AC games.

The game play was just an advanced looking version of all the other FF games (minus when you could summon gigantic things to fight for you, those were cool). I doubt there is going to be a whole lot of change with the remake in that respect i'm sure to hold homage to the original.  All in all FF7 was great in 1997.  But if you are a current gamer now and have played AAA games for the last decade, you will be disappointed and bored with the original.  I'd wait and play the remake.  They will have the same story line (like i said was amazing) with beefed up graphics and probably better in every way."

AskGames,3az8xa,Peanlocket,6,Wed Jun 24 18:14:58 2015 UTC,"I feel like a lot of roquelike games use randomness to great effect.  The procedural level generation of such games makes sure that no matter how experienced you are in the game, you'll always have to deal with different challenges. A well designed roguelike has a lot to offer in terms of replayability.  Recent games in the genre like Spelunky, FTL, Rogue Legacy and The Binding of Isaac have proved that RNG can be not only fun, but a major component of their design.  Forcing a player to adapt is great, and that's where RNG shines the most; not on random loot, not on artificially extending a game, but rather on keeping the player on their feet at all times."
AskGames,3az8xa,Auriora,4,Wed Jun 24 18:53:38 2015 UTC,keeping the player on their feet at all times.   Great point. This was the main appeal of Left 4 Dead for me. It forced me to understand the tactics of safely clearing an area of zombies rather than rely on memorization of spawn locations.

It is extremely challenging, and every playthrough is different. There is no guarantee you're going to win each game, and in fact the large majority of the time you will lose horribly. It's done so well, however, that it never feels like a chore, and each game is fun, and different. Highly recommended."

AskGames,3az8xa,creepingcold,-2,Thu Jun 25 07:51:15 2015 UTC,"Thinking of writing an article that praises RNG and shows why it's nothing to be afraid of.   shouldn't you have any own ideas then? however, no offense, but have fun with it.  RNG is always used to either get money from customers by drops or whatever, or to stretch out the content of otherwise limited games.  you find heavy amounts of RNG only in casino games, poker for example, where it's the core of the gameplay, but we all know about its negative reputation. card games are most likely the only RNG based games out there.  you also find rng in games like diablo, where it comes down to item drops, and it's only purpose is it to give the game some more depth which doesn't really exist."
AskGames,3az8xa,AntiZombieDelta,2,Wed Jun 24 18:35:27 2015 UTC,"As /u/Auriora pointed out, RNG has been used to great effect in many roguelike games and even in games like L4D where even though the level is the same you don't know where your enemies will be during each playthrough. It is not always a content stretch or a cash grab.  As for your poker example, chance actually plays a rather small part in poker. The player dealt the worst hand in the whole round can easily be the one to win the hand. Poker is about playing your opponents, not playing your cards. You can actually do rather well at poker without ever looking at the hands you are dealt, if you can read your opponents well enough. Though that does bring a little more randomness into your decision making."

AskGames,3aywlw,catdog4,3,Wed Jun 24 16:45:36 2015 UTC,Sounds a bit like Populous: The Beginning
AskGames,3aywlw,pablomakaveli,2,Wed Jun 24 22:46:50 2015 UTC,"Populous: The Beginning:       Populous: The Beginning is a strategy and god-style video game. It is the third entry in the Populous video game series, developed by Bullfrog Productions in 1998. The PC version of the game was released November 30, 1998 and a PlayStation version was later developed and released on April 2, 1999.  Unlike earlier games in the series, which cast the player in the role of a god influencing loyal followers, The Beginning took a radical departure and placed the player in the role of a shaman, who directly leads her tribe against opponents. Throughout the twenty-five missions of the campaign, the player leads their tribe across a solar system, dominating enemy tribes and tapping new sources of magic, with the ultimate goal of the shaman attaining godhood herself.  Populous: The Beginning was the first entry in the series to use true 3D computer graphics; Bullfrog waited four years after Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods so that the graphics technology could catch up to their vision for a new and different game in the series. The developers considered the addition of terrain deformation and manipulation, combined with ""smart"" villagers who automatically attended to tasks, to add an entirely new dimension to the series. The game's original title was Populous: The Third Coming before being changed prior to the beta release.  Populous: The Beginning plays very differently from earlier titles and received mixed reviews. Reviewers noted the excellent graphics, while complaints were directed at the artificial intelligence and the indecision in game design between being a real time strategy title and a god game. GamePro‚Äç‚Ää'‚Äãs Peter Olafson wrote that Populous: The Beginning was a good game but was ""without a quintessential quality that defined Populous.""

Lowering the barrier of entry into game development results in an awful lot of new ideas and experiences that otherwise would not have been possible.

AskGames,3apmye,v5000a,3,Mon Jun 22 14:04:52 2015 UTC,"Final fantasy games are not related in lore, universe and even some gameplay mechanics.  The first games only shared some mechanics and a story around crystals.  As more games started being released some more common elements like chocobos, the name of one character and summons were transferred from game to game but characters world and story were always stand alone, unique to each game.  I'm trying to think of movies series as an example but so far nothing comes up, they normally share the same universe but FF doesn't even that.  Imagine 007 if each movie had a completely different special agent as protagonist and only small things kept the same like Q and gadgets but everything else changed from movie to movie. That's the closest I can think of.  The only FF games that are related are the ones that share the same number like Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-II. The later is a sequel of the first.  PC ports are kinda bad, although perfectly playable, just bad ports in a way that it feels like playing an emulator with low fps than a PC game. This is true for the single player ports the MMOS (11 and 14) run just fine in PC.  Difficulty varies a little from game to game but they are generally easy, giving more predominance to story. There are some hard challenges for you in some of them like FF VII emerald and ruby weapons, but they aren't mandatory. If you get to a point where creatures are getting difficult you can always grind a little to level up once or twice and things become easier just like that."

AskGames,3apmye,dinoseen,2,Sat Jul 4 15:46:29 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I'd start with one of the older games. Not because they're better than the newer ones (but also not worse), but so you can appreciate how much the series improved from a graphical standpoint -- case in point, just compare VI and VII.  Also, I'd stay away from the first two games; the first lacks considerably in story, and the second is only really interesting if you want to see what a truly broken (but very exploitable) leveling system looks like. Not that these games aren't any fun, but they didn't age terribly well.  Anyway, my personal favorites are - in order - VI, VII, V and XII."
AskGames,3apmye,UglierThanMoe,3,Tue Jun 23 00:52:57 2015 UTC,"Almost all Final Fantasy titles are stand alone.  The exceptions being Final Fantasy X & X-2 and Final Fantasy XIII 1, 2, & 3.  You do not need to play the main titles in order or can skip around.  Final Fantasy XI & XIV are MMO titles.  FF games are pretty straight forward.  Most focus on some variation turn based combat (FFXII & FFXIII are exceptions).  Everyone tends to have a favorite.  Personally I would pick up either FFVI (also known as 3 in the US), FFIX or FFX.  FFX is the first to feature voice acting and it wasn't good at the time so keep that in mind.  FFVII was the first RPG for a lot of people and may be a good place to focus.  But keep in mind the remake is coming out in 3-100 years; you can play it for a comparison or wait for the remake.    The Game Boy titles are not ports but actually SaGa games, they were titled FF games when brought over.  The Game Boy Advance titles are ports of the actual games.    How easy are the FF games, can someone like me pick them up and understand mechanics without previous knowledge in rpgs?   Yes, they were one of my first actual RPGs.  My love knows no bounds for FFVI.  Main JRPGs in general tend to dole out the game mechanics slowly.  You shouldn't have a problem adjusting to the gameplay.    You should play them if you like expansive worlds with various characters on a mission to save the world.  If you like anime it would be a plus as most of the titles contain anime tropes.  Plus the music is pretty good.  Edit : spelling mistakes"

AskGames,3apmye,dewsh,2,Tue Jun 23 02:16:49 2015 UTC,"Aside from a few exceptions that make it fairly obvious that they are sequels, all the Final Fantasies are self-contained stories. So Final Fantasy 1 - 10, 12 & 13, are safe to play without any prior knowledge of the series.   Most of the games do changes to the mechanics as well, so you need little knowledge of how the game works.  Starting with the FF X/X-2 HD Remaster for PS3 (coming soon to PS4 afaik) is a good place to start. Stay away from the Steam versions of FF7, 8, and 13.

I can't recommend enough that you avoid it, unless you intend to play a rom hack.   As for the best stand alone game in the series to begin with? Depends on what you're looking for in a game. If you enjoy whimsical medieval fantasy, and a polished storyline, start with IX. Something more like Shadowrun, and you're willing to sacrifice the overall experience for iconic highs and wince inducing lows? VII. Want the newest graphics, and enjoy the grind of combat more than town visits and exploration? XIII. Prefer classic pixel art instead, and prefer a slightly abridged story? Any of the GBA or PSP remakes, but avoid the American release of IV on GBA, as Square returns to bad habits, and rushes another unfinished game to market."

AskGames,3aluho,Satsumomo,4,Sun Jun 21 14:17:55 2015 UTC,"It's additional programming, which means more time is spent in each mission, which costs more.   GTAV had a huge budget and could afford it. It also depends on the studio, it can be that it didn't even pass through their mind."
AskGames,3aluho,Squidmanjones,2,Sun Jun 21 16:21:59 2015 UTC,"Not just that but it's also a lot about the intended difficulty of the whole game. If developers want you to work very hard to beat their game, then why on earth would they put that feature in?  GTA wasn't meant to be a difficult game, but just a very easy going game. To say that budget is the only factor isn't fair, because I like difficult games and I hate when games give me the option to skip, because I feel it devalues the mission and the game."
AskGames,3aluho,Satsumomo,5,Sun Jun 21 18:39:43 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean, but when you have an unskippable 3 minute cutscene, or like in the case of the initial GTA's where you'd have to drive all the way back to the mission (No skill involved) I think it doesn't have to do with making the game less difficult/challenging.  It would be like VVVVV or Super Hexagon making you go through an unskippable intro everytime you fail.  Edit: Damn! I misread OP's post, I thought he meant skipping the initial drive and so, not actual parts of the mission. Yeah that's actually stupid and I agree with you."

AskGames,3aluho,neobowman,4,Sun Jun 21 18:42:33 2015 UTC,"I mean yeah, but this isn't life, it's a game. If someone's not enjoying it, the developers have something to work on. That's why difficulty settings exist."
AskGames,3aluho,JackTLogan,-3,Sun Jun 21 18:51:40 2015 UTC,"But games are a facet of life.  20 years ago this entitlement didn't exist.  You played a game, and if you sucked hard enough, you couldn't finish it.  Unless you used cheats.    It's very interesting how the cultural attitude change is reflected in how we think about games.  It's not ""I enjoy this game but can't get past this part, so I'm going to practice until I get good enough to reach the next level.""  Now the attitude is ""I paid for this game; I deserve to be able to beat it.""    There is no concept of earning, only entitlement.  It's actually the same attitude we have about college these days.  ""I paid you $30,000, if my kid is flunking it's because you're not doing your job."""

Perhaps those starting off in poorer circumstances would be playing on harder difficulties, and those with disabilities or traumatic experiences have 'skulls on' like in Halo to heighten the difficulty even more.   Or perhaps we are playing on a 'hardcore' server, where we are susceptible to injury and disease, have very basic skills and rudimentary capabilities, and only one life. Perhaps in other servers (alternate realities?) we are running around with super powers, immortality or multiple lives and cheats activated.   One of my friends posed the same theory as yours to me a while back, but suggested we could just be aliens controlling these 'alien lifeforms' (humans) through some hyper realistic simulator to the point that we believe we really are the humans, and only regain our identities as the aliens once our character dies, we get a Game Over and are forced to exit out of the Spaceboxstation U back to our real lives as {insert alien species name here}."

Oh brother, I sure wouldn't mind that at all. Well, just so long as our original superalien species is hotter (more attractive) than even the hottest, super-sexiest human is.   Or perhaps we are playing on a 'hardcore' server, where we are susceptible to injury and disease, have very basic skills and rudimentary capabilities, and only one life.    Ever hear about the ""Quantum Immortality Theory?"" Apparently (some) parallel realities are where we've already died, but when we ""die,"" we wake up in another of our bodies in a parallel universe the next day (or the same day), possibly having had a nightmare of said death.   The death event may repeat throughout various parallel realities, until we decide to do something different to keep us living. (e.g. take another route to work, thereby avoiding your fatal accident that you've already suffered in 359 prior parallel universes, just as many times.)  This life-game may make everything look ""hard-core,"" but we may secretly have INFINITE lives, thanks to the Quantum Immortality Theory.  So if you miss some dearly-departed friends and loved-ones, console yourself in the possibility that they may happily continue to live their lives in a parallel universe where their deaths were somehow avoided.   Perhaps those starting off in poorer circumstances would be playing on harder difficulties, and those with disabilities or traumatic experiences have 'skulls on' like in Halo to heighten the difficulty even more.

I mean if we were all really Jabba the Hunt slug aliens, surely we would find that attractive. Unless all our years in the human simulator brainwashed us into only finding humans attractive... Hmm.   That's a very interesting theory indeed, I believe that's what Edge of Tomorrow was based on, although I haven't actually seen the movie yet, only read the summary. It'd be great if true, but surely we are always under the impression that we only have one life? Unless of course after dying the 'first time' we retain our memories so that we know what to do differently. That would be alright.   I started on the normal difficulty I guess, but it's now on the heroic or legendary (going by Halo terms, or the second hardest/hardest setting otherwise). In terms of skulls? Probably the Repeated Bullying skull, Mum Dying skull, Girls Taking Advantage And Giving Me Trust Issues skull, aaaand the Do Great In School, Screw Up University Entry Exams skull.   Ah yeah I saw that. Sorry to hear that, if this was a game ideally you could activate some cheats to make things better.

Even though it added some good gameplay elements, I think it's better to experience the purity of FO3 first.   If you really want to get familiar with the Fallout universe first, and you like retro games, you might even start with Fallout 2. But it's a completely different game style, it's a top down view, rather than a first person (or over the shoulder third person) view.   Edit: and if you do play Fallout 3, and you have the GOTY edition with all the DLC, I'd even recommend disabling all the DLC except for Broken Steel until after you've finished the main game. It would be unclear to a new player which missions are DLC and which are the main storyline and which are original side quests. They kind of dump all the DLC missions on you right from the beginning which takes away from the immersion. My 2 cents."

They're still releasing content for BF4, entirely for free for me because I, like a lot of people, have Premium. With such a poor BF4 launch, I've become very wary and will wait a significant time before buying - so that impulse purchase of BF4 didn't happen for Hardline. With StarWars Battlefront coming out later this year, it makes Hardline feel like a place-holder, which makes it feel like a waste of money (I know it's not!).

AskGames,3abt5n,glorkcakes,7,Thu Jun 18 20:44:55 2015 UTC,"Ok, here's a better answer for what a Metroidvania is. Back in the early days of NES there was Metroid, the game that literally spawned the genre, and at the time this game seemed to be really big but it was really small. They accomplished this by allowing you to unlock areas of the map by getting certain powerups.   For example one of the abities in Metroid is that you can roll into a ball and that would make you half a block shorter than what you normally are. Suddenly you could access areas that had one block openings.   Which doesn't seem like a big deal, but that could essentially unlock areas right at the beginning of the game. As you progress through the game you gain more and more abilities unlocking more and more of the map.   Also, they lock loot behind an obstacle that would require you to have a certain ability to get it later. Doing this made the map feel much more bigger than it really was. Even to this day, I don't feel like I found every secret in Metroid. But, that is what makes them so much fun. Exploration and getting new abilities and opening up new areas."
AskGames,3abt5n,MrTubzy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:52:16 2015 UTC,"To add to this, Metroidvania is the fusion of these elements, with the rpg system of leveling up, and collecting items and equipment."
AskGames,3abt5n,Red-Blue-,3,Sun Jun 21 05:00:21 2015 UTC,"A Metroid-vania is a genre of games. It's name comes from the old Metroid and Castlevania games over the years. It doesn't have to be 2D, but it usually is. The most important features are:   action game where you control a character non-linear world with a map or themed zones upgrades in abilities, ammo, etc to allow progression   That's it. The world isn't linear (think, World 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, etc) like the very first Castlevania was. You get dropped into the world and can go anywhere you want. The enemies might kill you, or you might not be able to reach a door, but you can go anywhere. Later you get rockets, or double jump, or the ability to shrink small and can access those places. You spend a lot of time back-tracking. The areas will usually be themed so you can recognize them as you travel around. You don't want everything to look the same because players will get lost.  Some examples to compare:   Metroid series Castlevania series Dust: An Elysian Trail Guacamelee VVVVVV Ori and the Blind Forest La-Mulana Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate"

There were plenty of games before that in the style.  Another early favorite of mine was Blaster Master on NES. It was the Dark Souls of my childhood. The upgrades came to your tank, which at the start of the game can shoot left and right. Later, you gain access to another area of the map you have been driving by already 50 times, because you can shoot up now. The access to the 4th boss is directly above where you start the game, but you had to be able to hover to get higher enough to reach it.

AskGames,3abt5n,koredozo,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:31:35 2015 UTC,"RPG elements aren't a crucial component of a Metroidvania, though they're quite common due to the influence of the definitive game in the genre, Symphony of the Night. The genre was actually created by the first Metroid game for NES (the Castlevania games were pretty much conventional platformers at the time.)  You can think of a Metroidvania as an open-world 2D platformer. Rather than being segmented into short levels that don't give you the option to backtrack and/or have to be completed in a time limit, such as with the Mario games, a Metroidvania takes place in a single interconnected area that you can (and must) explore at your leisure. Progression through the game is not linear; instead, after clearing an area you tend to gain new abilities or items, after which you can backtrack and reach other areas you weren't able to before with your newfound powers.  Playing some games in the genre is definitely the best way to get an idea of what a Metroidvania entails though. Compare and contrast them with other platformers like Mario and Sonic and the difference is easy to see."
AskGames,3aawyl,_Ishmael,21,Thu Jun 18 16:51:46 2015 UTC,It's not that it's hard to hit 60 at 1080 for consoles. It's hard to do all that and actually look decent in the process.  So when it comes to choosing between high graphical fidelity and a decent framerate most devs and publishers choose the former because that's something that actually sells games and high frame rate(for the most part) does not.
AskGames,3aawyl,Neo-Calypso,8,Thu Jun 18 17:11:57 2015 UTC,"ELI5? OK.  It takes processing power to put each pixel on the screen.  The more pixels, the more processing power.  1080p is more of a marketing term than a real standard, because it only refers to the number of horizontal lines (1080), and says nothing about the number of VERTICAL lines. However, 1920x1080 is pretty common.  That breaks down to 1920 pixels times 1080 pixels = 2,073,600 pixels. That's a lot.  60fps means, of course, you're drawing 2,073,600 pixels, sixty times EVERY SECOND. That's a lot.  Then there's the additional processing that goes on behind each pixel. Stuff like calculating light & shadow, motion blur, depth of field & focus blur, translucency, etc.  Consol systems inherently make compromises on performance, to keep the price down. So while their graphics cards are good, they're not a good as they could be.  In addition to simply drawing the pixels on the screen, there's all the calculations that go on to make the information happen. Like AI processing, physics, changing textures, object occlusion, audio, handling user input, etc.  Those compromises on price/performance hit the processing power too, so the more calculations the system has to make, the harder it has to work.   Which is why systems tend to stutter and lag when there is a lot of action."

AskGames,3aawyl,autowikibot,12,Thu Jun 18 18:22:30 2015 UTC,"Because devs choose not to. In the games where they choose not to, most of the time, those games have a heavy influence from marketing. What marketing cares about is what makes a pretty screen shot, so they would rather halve the frame rate so they can get a boost on the fidelity.  Take the Watch_Dogs E3 ""downgrade"" fiasco for example. The only thing people were talking about for months was a reduction in the fidelity of the graphics. What message is that sending to developers? It sends the message that making it prettier and fancier is the most important thing.  It doesn't matter how powerful your hardware is. At 30 fps, you will get to make each frame prettier than if it was at 60fps. Even if you have a PC that can run every existing game at max graphics 60fps, eventually the day will come when a game comes out that won't, where you'll have to choose between lowering graphics to play at 60fps, or turning everything on and dealing with a lowered frame rate. With consoles, marketing makes the choice for us.  TL;DR: What is hard about hitting 60fps at 1080p for consoles is trying to convince marketing/execs that the high standard is more important than pretty screenshots."
AskGames,3aawyl,Reliant,2,Thu Jun 18 17:10:02 2015 UTC,"Well, there is the option of making hardware more powerful, but yeah."
AskGames,3aawyl,Actinism,2,Fri Jun 19 03:02:04 2015 UTC,"Because graphics sells better than framerate and non-upscaled resolution.  Companies want to give a ""next-gen"" experience and look in order to move units.  Key example:  Assassin's Creed Unity.  This game has far greater NPC counts that was previously possible, and graphically looks better than any previous AssCreed game.  However, the hardware upgrade, while substantial in certain areas, isn't a big enough leap forward to be able to handle huge increases in both areas.  Compound this with strict deadlines and an unfamiliarity with the new hardware compared to the old, and you run into big performance problems.  But the previous generation had plenty of upscaled resolution and 30 fps, so that's the area that has to suffer.    You can't go backwards in terms of graphics, or people will crucify you.  Just look at the butthurt over the graphical increase between New Vegas and Fallout 4 not being big enough.  Companies are pressured to do something they couldn't do before with gameplay or else people will look to some other company that will do something new or bigger or more impressively.  Resolution and framerates just aren't game selling unlike those others."
AskGames,3aawyl,ZapActions-dower,2,Thu Jun 18 19:42:33 2015 UTC,"1080p @ 60fps = 124,416,000 pixels that need to be rendered EVERY SECOND.  720p @ 30fps = 27,648,000 pixels  So basically, 1080p@60 takes 450% more computing power than 720p@30fps.  Now the difficulty of rendering those pixels changes based on how complex the graphics are. If you're only generating a 2D image, there's a lot less math involved in computing each pixel. Once you get into fancy 3D games with dynamic lighting, reflections, physics, etcetc, the time it takes to calculate the color of each pixel scales up as well."

AskGames,3a42om,Alunnite,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:00:50 2015 UTC,"The best description of BG is that it is a is the evolution of Dungeons and Dragons. While I have no interest in D&D I have really enjoyed all the BG games I have played and its nice to see the origins of most RPGs. The ones I played were quite challenging and I think they use old school fantasy tropes (save the world from bad magic man using stick that shoots lightning at animated skeletons), which might be forgivable because the originals would have created some of those tropes.  I think HF1 is still thought of as good, though I haven't personally played it. Its not talked about as much as  HL2 because HL2 is the closest thing to perfect game and the orignal so the orginal can't really match that standrd. That being said it is the basis of HL2, TF2, and many more games. It looks pretty old now but use can use Black Messa to make it look better. I've seen BM in the store so I'm not sure if its a standalone game now but it did used to be a free mod that make HL1 look better but it was slightly abridged verson of the game. Anyone could use it as long as you owned a steam game that used the source engine (I think) which would be Portal, Dota, TF2, Half Life, ect.  Civ 4 is still a good game. I think many critics would argue that 4 is better than 5, even if they did include the DLC from 5."

NewDark patch should be included with the steam release, it fixes most compatibility issues and allows more mod functionality.

Maybe their methods aren't the best, but their ideal isn't evil. Nor is the Assassins' ideal the ""right choice"". Both talk of a utopian society, but each have their own flaws.   The Assassins fight for freedom, where everyone can live their own life the way they want. Though this could lead to widespread chaos and disorder. The Templars fight for order through control, where everyone is protected and controlled so there's no crime. Of course, this limits people's freedom of speech and privacy.   I could go into the philosophy and politics of both but I'm honestly really horrible with words so I'd probably botch it, but both ideologies have their place in history, and neither one of them is inherently wrong.

TW2 prologue & initial plot spoiler :  Geralt, the main character, is working as a personal bodyguard for a king (quite reluctantly since it's not his choice nor his profession since he's a monster slayer). During a battle, the king is assassinated and Geralt is wrongly accused of regicide. Letho, the antagonist and true murderer, escapes before his eyes.  Consequently, the initial game's plot is to catch Letho in order to clear your name. As your progress through the story, The game makes you understand that the reason you're running after Letho are much more complex.  TW2 Letho & Geralt character development spoilers :  Depending on the choices you take, you can actually clear your name before catching him, and if you don't, your friends make you realize that what strangers think of you shouldn't matter anyway and that bigots will always hate you no matter if you're innocent. Plus, the kingdom of the assassinated king is going so much into shit that the threat of having a bounty on your head is becoming thinner and thinner  Secondly, you learn along the story that Letho never wanted you any harm and is actually an old acquaintance (Geralt has amnesia). You just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Not only did he help you in the past, but he actually spares your life at some point in the game where he had you at his mercy.  Meeting the antagonist thus become more about learning more about yourself and him than a simple vengeance/justice story.   The final confrontation allows you to talk with Letho so that he can explain why he did everything he did. And while the character is clearly not a saint, he's no more of a villain than other characters you associated yourself with Vernon & Ioverth are clearly killers and killed many innocent people, more than Letho did.   You can decide to fight him or let him go (because The Witcher is always about choice) but if we're a bit honest you don't really have a personal reason to kill him."

My recommendation would be to catch both Asylum and City during the steam sale for probably less than $10 and play those first and then play Knight. You can skip Origins as it was a weak entry in the series and wasn't made by the same developer that made Asylum, City, and Knight.

AskGames,39oybn,Drook,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:52:24 2015 UTC,"No, I don't mean FMV or recorded footage in general, but live performances or in a broader sense live game creation, like a DM would do in a pen&paper RPG, just with the benefits of modern technology like motion capture.  Two more examples come to mind:   Sleep is Death, this is a low tech version, one player plays essentially an text+graphic adventure game, while the second player handles the games reaction to the players interaction with the game world Sleep No More doesn't use computers at all, as it's a theater play, but the audience here doesn't just sit back and watch, but can walk around on stage and interact with the actors. That's something you could adapt pretty directly into a multiplayer video game. Games like Zelda: Majora's Mask, The Last Express or Facade go into a similar direction by having the games story play out in realtime without waiting for player input, but all of them are just regular old recorded games, not live performances.   There is also Garrys Mod and some other 3D/VR chat programs that allow interaction between multiple people, but I don't know if any of that was ever turned into a real interactive performance, instead of just casual chat and watching Youtube together. Live streaming a Kinect scanned 3D model into a 3D chat should be technically feasible.  There is of course also the roleplaying some people do in games like ARMA and that might be the closest to what I am looking for, but it doesn't have a DM/player split, every player in there has to be actor and gamer at the same time, so the player has to put a lot of effort into it to make it believable. It's also a game about shooting people, so the story telling is somewhat limited."

One group of people is disgusted with many current video game journalists abusing their power of press to further the careers of personal friends. They want to stop the poorly written articles that have been turning from infomational video game pieces to what amounts to social progressivism and tabloid level quality articles.  One group is disgusted with the abundance of vitrol, anger and hostility that is present in the video game social communities that has fostered in these gaming social circles. They're hoping to elimiate online hostility and agression from the videogame community at large.   Things get confusing when Feminism spilled into it, which has little to do with Gamergate, but these two groups seem to have accepted Feminism being a valid topic, for some reason, even though feminists are in both groups.  How this could relate to you:   Don't talk about GamerGate, if you come out in support of one group you'll apparently get angy personal threats, if you come out in support of the other group then you'll have angry letters sent to your work trying to get you fired. If you care about stopping internet harassment, and also about jouralistic integrity. Then both groups claim they want you. There is a lot of overlap on what both of these groups agree on but some teritorial shit is going on here, a lot of us-vs-them, black-and-white arguments are used by both to motivate and attack the other group. If you can stay objective and impartial, it's really quite facinating to follow, a lot of people are pretending it's not that important but what happens will color how dialogue between large anonymous communites on the internet will go.

See Breit Bart, who is the antithesis of what the next group stands for -   For people concerned about ethics in videogame journalism, it's a long overdue correction. They point out that critics don't share their connections with the people who make the games, and their objectivity may be compromised. They're also focused on the tabloidization of debate about issues such as sexual violence, perhaps to the point where they ignore other issues raised. If games are to be art, shouldn't they be held to that standard in their writing, as well? It gets messier from there.   For internet trolls, it's just more targets, and a good cover. They've also been playing feminist gamers and anti-feminist gamers against each other for their own lulz. It's difficult to figure out how many are actually in Gamer Gate, and this is a point of contention between GG and it's critics.  For libertarians, it's about the first amendment. They believe that if you censor unpopular opinions, we'll begin to censor elsewhere, as well. In extreme form, some have even gone so far as to advocate for child rape as an artistic statement/gameplay mechanic.    For anti-feminists, they see it as an overreach from outsiders. Videogames were marketed almost exclusively towards men in the mid-80's to late 90's. They prefer we return to that time.  There's other factions - for example, a jilted boyfriend who manipulated the internet into becoming his personal army. But if you try to keep up with all of it, you'll only find the rabbit hole getting deeper."

These two games plus their respective expansions make up one epic adventure which I still consider to be the epitome of western RPGs despite the games having been release from the late 1990s to the early 2000s. The isometric 2D graphics do look dated nowadays, but the Baldur's Gate saga features one of the most epic and best-told stories in any RPG. And at least for me, that's more important than anything else.  Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut. After the - compared to the original Deus Ex - rather disappointing sequel, Deus Ex: Invisible War, followed by almost a decade of silence, DX:HR was a revelation. It captured all the good things of the original DX and improved upon them, with the exception of mandatory boss fights that required you to switch from whatever play style you preferred to all-out guns blazing. The director's cut fixed that, and also melted the The Missing Link expansion seamlessly into the main game. The original Deus Ex will probably stay unsurpassed forever, but DX:HR came damn close."

But by buying their stock, you increase their stock prices and basically give them money to buy up your stock or expand their company.  It also very heavily relies on a system of supply and demand.

AskGames,39gqqz,shiram,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:41:42 2015 UTC,"As a Playstation gamer (all generations), I do have to admit I like the XBox controller for PC a lot.   I have the wireless version, and I have nothing bad to remark about it. However, I was quite annoyed at how the products are sold and packaged (and imo unclear packaging causing you to have to buy more after you realize your confusion).   Bought a wireless controller and a ""plug and play"" (usb charger) kit. Turns out, wireless controllers are sold without wireless receivers. That's okay, I can play with the usb cable, right? Wrong. The usb cable only charges. It doesn't transmit data. As a further annoyance, the USB cable, for some ungodly reason, only charges the controller while it's plugged into a PC. Not into a regular power socket using a mobile adapter. What's the point, if there's no data transfer occurring over the usb cable??? How do you get a wireless receiver? Unless you want to buy some knock-offs via Ebay/Amazon/Chinese websites, you need to buy a controller+receiver kit. Stores don't have them all the time from my experience. The wireless receiver broke at some point (cats like biting cables), so I had to buy a new controller (!) or I wouldn't be able to use my old ones.   In all, I spent over ‚Ç¨180 to be able to play with a single controller. I have two backup controllers still in the packaging.  But I must say, it's a joy to work with the controller.   Games always detect it flawlessly. Some Steam games only do it when launching from Steam Big Picture, but that's the game's fault, not the controller's. Battery life is just amazing. Both when you enable vibration or not, its lifespan is phenomenal. Ergonomically very good. Doesn't cramp your hands as much as the PS3 controller does after a while (PS4 controller doesn't, though.

AskGames,39705x,ozmozez,4,Tue Jun 9 18:35:36 2015 UTC,"DA:I maps are more diverse but didn't feel like part of a world to me.   They felt like a collection of the generic ""MMO zones"" you encounter in a video game without a clear artistic direction. You get the desert zone, the jungle zone, the highlands zone, etc.   At no point did I feel that people actually live in this world. It felt like the world was crafted FOR me instead of me exploring a world that exists regardless if I'm here or not. It also felt like several people worked without communicating and then decided to ""glue"" all the zones.  And to be honest, I felt that if they didn't want to aim for something believable, then they should have done something even more creative in terms of design & art direction (like Final Fantasy games with floating islands, 300 feet tall swords stuck in mountains, or flying magical crystals). DA:I is stuck in the middle-ground.  Anyway, the Witcher 3 is less diverse but actually gives you a bigger ""wow"" effect because it's much more believable. Not counting the prologue/epilogue areas, you have two huge zones:   Velen, where you find your typical countryside, small forests, bogs, swamps and hills. You also have two huge and really immersive medieval cities Skellige, an archipel of islands where you find something looking like Scotland and Northern Europe medieval culture.    Where the game shines is because you actually believe everything you see. The villages are in places that make sense, same for the cities, you feel like there are enough food and natural resources around to feed people. You don't feel like you're in a world with 10 times more bandits than honest citizens. And the zones don't feel like small closed areas (because besides the Hinterlands, that's how I felt in DA:I), you can see miles away and the maps are huge.  What also helps the immersion is the amazing weather system they included. This can completely change the tone of an area. Play in some place during the day with a clear sky, and play it at night with a storm will give you completely different feelings."
AskGames,39705x,n0ggy,2,Wed Jun 10 12:06:20 2015 UTC,"I'd say the natural elements of The Witcher 3 environments are better. The trees look incredible and varied, there's a lot of incidental that simply adds to a broad canvas making it feel real and involving.  The weather effects also feel random and lifelike, wind bending the bows of small trees and weather leaving puddles.  Conversely I would argue that DA:I has better architecture. There's a subtle and meticulous clarity to the buildings and ruins in Inquisition. You can tell the race of the builders and inhabitants simply by stonework and art design. Witcher's cities often feel a little identikit and overly similar.   They're very different games though, excellent and detailed in their own way."

AskGames,3904g7,bravesirkiwi,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:44:45 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about your choices in your first playthrough, it's all about trial and error and experimentation. I think your friends are almost right, but it isn't as much that the game opens up as much as something just clicks. DS is like chess, simple appearance at first but a whole lot underneath.   Particularly in combat. It seems like a sludgy hack n slash at first. But as you dig deeper into the mechanics you'll find it's incredibly elegant (albeit unforgiving) and very replayable.  I'd absolutely recommend giving it just a few more hours. First spend a while online and read about stamina management, poise, and rolling iframes. These are the most important beginning concepts. Then go in and use what you learned, practice, play with the timings. You're playing chess, treat combat as such.   With some persistence it will click and suddenly you'll be experimenting with the toolset, developing a personal playstyle, (dying a lot), and overcoming some of the most rewarding challenges you'll find in a game."
AskGames,3904g7,n0ggy,5,Tue Jun 9 00:53:27 2015 UTC,"Regarding the gameplay, comparing it to OOT is indeed a very good comparison. So if you don't like it now, I don't think you will like it at all.  Dark Souls' combat is praised for many reasons:   the controls are extremely responsive (except jumping) and you can rarely blame the game for your mistakes the difficulty curve is well done, the game doesn't suddenly becomes trivially easy or hard there's a sense of weight in the attack moves (you actually feel like you're swinging an axe) it is highly based on skill and equipment has little influence on your success   But:   you don't have a shit-ton of combo moves. It's not comparable to Devil May Cry or Bayonetta in that regard the pacing is relatively slow, which might not be for everyone it's more about tactic than strategy it is repetitive, but then again I'd like you to give me an example of an action that isn't   (However I can't possibly imagine someone can be honest and still call it ""dull"")  Concerning the story, it's very very peculiar in the sense that there is a very rich lore, but most of it is hidden:   NPCs have very little dialog, most of the story is in item descriptions tons of things in the story aren't explicitly said, but understood through logical conclusions and speculation. Dark Souls is the only game I know where fan speculation can be considered canon. (For example the identity of Gwyn's first son: it is never said but there is too much evidence for the conclusion to be only simple speculation) for this reason, it is the only game I know where both the game studio AND the community are co-writers of the story in a certain way. You aren't a passive audience, you must use your imagination as you did when you were a kid, and that's extremely refreshing in the world of video games because games are supposed to be interactive, both in gameplay and story. it is highly non-linear, you learn the story the way an archaeologist learns about a culture. Sometimes the first thing you find is something of little importance or a piece of a puzzle that you'll only understand a long time after. Sometimes you learn about a very important thing because of the item description of a rusted axe. The reason you learn the story that way is because you're supposed to be in a dying world with a culture that just isn't there anymore. the game uses the ""show, don't tell"" movie-making mantra to an extreme (environmental storytelling). For example, the game never tells you that you are only one among many undead trying to accomplish the prophecy. But you notice that you find a lot of ""hero souls"" along your journey and can conclude that they were the ""previous heroes"".    The reason the game has this distant and indirect way to tell a story is because the whole point of Dark Souls is about making you feel alone in a world that used to be alive but is now dead. No one talks to you, no one explains you things. You just looks at ruins and bones and dream about a world that used to be.  Absolutely everything in the game is done to support that sense of despair, melancholy, and solitude: the slow pacing, how enemies seem to be tired and shambling, the absence of music for the most part, the short multiplayer interactions with little possibilities of dialog, the tragic destinies of most of the characters, etc.  TL;DR: I just don't think this game is made for you, which is fine, but at no point can you claim it isn't doing anything new in the world of video games."

I think it could've used maybe a bit more ""tell"" for me to draw me in so that the first question I asked wasn't ""what's going on?"" and instead ""what's gonna happen next?""  Though I realize most action games are by nature repetitive, I think the mark of a good action game (for me) is that you never feel that repetition. I don't know why I feel it so much in DaS as opposed to something like DmC; I suppose it's just a matter of taste.

AskGames,3907fk,n0ggy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:45:01 2015 UTC,It's hardtop guess how long a player will use the menu or non-intensive activities. So the might still need to load. And if you're using the menu while the game is trying to load something it might feel a bit sluggish to move between options to the player. All that feels worse to the player than a slightly longer load time.
AskGames,38zcim,InfernoKant,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:52:59 2015 UTC,"I'd say that's just a cheap way of making the enemies/obstacles easier to traverse and fight, since the nature of games make most have generally inconsistent game worlds. You see the same thing in Mirror's Edge (Runner vision) as a easy way to show you the path to use for practically no development time. I wouldn't say that methods like 'Eagle vision' or 'Senses' are strictly needed, since players can be directed along a pathway with some other method (see Left 4 Dead's Developer Commentary), but generally it's too expensive on developer time to be used.  I could be wrong about something in there, but this is kind of the armchair analysis from my perspective, being a fledgling gamedev. :)"
AskGames,38zcim,Enemby,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:13:49 2015 UTC,"The original reason was because of the huge amount of environmental details and actors in comparison to older titles. Compare Thief 2 to a game like Asscreed.   In Thief everything you needed to interact with was blindingly obvious because it was gold/lighter colored than everything else. Objects and people that can be interacted with were immediately distinguishable from the background and the game was sparsely detailed enough to make certain doors and hidden passageways clearly visible from dead ends and just generic wall textures.  In Asscreed that random pile of interactable books next to a whole bunch of other books, tapestries, candles, benches, whatever, just fades into the noise and it would be pretty hard to distinguish it unless it were to glow.  Why is it used nowadays? Because every other successful game does it and it feeds into a really big concern for developers: accessibility. If 7/10 players can use their brain and search for things normally without the aid of a magical glowy vision button then that means 30% of your playerbase can't and when 30% of your playerbase is having issues then you really need to fix that problem.  Is this the only solution, hell is it even a good one? No, but it's been tested and refined over dozens of popular high profile games, so implementing it at this point is a no brainer."
AskGames,38zcim,senbei616,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:25:53 2015 UTC,"Or detective vision in the Arkham series, or Instinct in Hitman: Absolution, or Dark Vision in Dishonored. Bottom line is, they all have them to make the game much easier for more casual players. Most games with this sort of thing are stealth-type games where you are generally going to be planning your encounters well in advance, and that is made far easier with a way to see the enemies in the next room through walls. It also removes the surprise element of finding an enemy looking straight at you when you walk through the door, which I personally don't think belongs in non-horror games outside of cutscenes and is more frustrating than fun when it happens."

So for most third-person action games or racing games, I will always use a controller.

I do love the halo series, but that's because I've always played them.  My partner would strongly recommend Ether One and Never Alone - Google them for more details though if you need clarification then ask away.  I've probably missed some, but there they are.  2)b) Mass Effect trilogy, Bioshock trilogy (Infinite is...polarising), Fallout NV (and 3), Alan Wake, Halo series. May have missed some.

AskGames,38qlfi,mysticzarak,2,Sat Jun 6 00:04:11 2015 UTC,"The short answer is not really.   Although you might pay those prices for an Xbox One game, the game itself isn't really at all like other Elder Scrolls games that she might be expecting. Just check out online opinions of the PC version of the game, it's the same thing as the console version with the same problems.  If you both check out the positives and negative sides of the game together and still decide to buy it then great. But the negatives are pretty big and even after coming back several times still turn me away.  The short version of it is the game is a mixed bag and not at the usual quality you might expect from these games.  Also I might add that she needs to be supervised with this game as the exposure  to other people online is greater then most other games by way of it being an MMO."

I'm a programmer/game designer myself and we definitely need more women involved in the development of games.  Moving on, I don't really know your familiarity with this genre so let me give a quick overview of what this game is. ESO (Elder Scrolls Online) is a game set in a very large world where thousands of people all across the world can come together and work as a team to accomplish different challenges and fight tough enemies.  In ESO there are a number of different things you need to do and acquire to get to the top and join in with other people to accomplish different challenges. The imperial edition gives you access to a very powerful type of character and a very important item known as a mount, which would allow your daughter to accomplish her tasks quicker.  TL;DR: It's not necessary, but it would help her out and get her some cool in-game things that she can use to better play the game.

If that is too expensive, then perhaps video games are not the best hobby for you to fund.   Second, it is a multiplayer game with a mature rating. The mature rating usually is not bad for a 12 year old (in my opinion, most 12 year olds have heard it all by that age), but the multiplayer aspect could lead to some potential problems with other players. I would suggest your daughter not talk to other players with a headset, and keep her age/sex private, and everything should be fine."

AskGames,38gohf,GreatEvilBetty,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:11:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah. If you re-enter the dungeon if you have beaten the boss already, right at the very very beginning of the dungeon there is a portal that appears that lets you teleport straight to the boss room. You can just beat the boss, and then continue on.  You don't have to beat EVERY boss all within 3 days, you just have to beat each one once, even if you reset the days, it stays ""cleared"". It would be impossible to beat all three dungeons and bosses in the three days the game gives you.  Also after beating dungeons later on, you usually get items that makes previous boss fights easier. If you are running low on time and are close to the boss room, but don't think you can beat it before time runs out(happened to me a few times). After getting the dungeon item, there are short-cuts to get to the boss room much much much faster. They're pretty obvious usually.  For example, in the swamp dungeon, now that you have the bow, you can just go to the room where you have to shoot the eye to raise the platform with the deku flower on it. Fly over to the frog sub-boss and get the boss key quickly then fly over again to the central chamber. The large flower platform in the middle should be spinning, just use the flame to light the torches and head to the room that leads to the boss room. Fairly quick, and you will have all the rest of day 1 and days 2 and 3 to work on the next stuff.  And always always ALWAYS remember to play the song of reversed time to slow time giving yourself those much needed minutes."

AskGames,38c7fy,Xanthien,7,Wed Jun 3 07:34:29 2015 UTC,"Top of the line for the first one would have to be Starcraft 2. I've heard decent things about Grey Goo too and it has more along the lines of building walls and manning them with units and the like, which seems to be your thing, and it's much less demanding actions wise, although a lot more shallow in the overall strategy department considering all 3 races have very similar units.  Number 3 would definitely be Wargame: Airland Battle. Red Dragon is the new one and I've heard it's much the same and better, however I haven't played so I won't comment, and they were only released a year or so apart anyway. Regardless, you can abuse forest for cover for infantry, vehicles too although they are easier to spot, the game conceals or reveals them entirely based on their stats and the vision stats of opposing units close by, generally you will need to be inside the forest or have a dedicated spotter to even know where some infantry units are hiding. There is also a lot of urban areas sprinkled through maps, where infantry squads can hide in buildings and shoot down stuff, and basically trade well with anything unless your opponent can get some good close quarters infantry in there with them. There is a lot of different terrain in the maps all having different effects.   I skipped number 2 on your list, because number 3 is the same, base building in Wargame is practically nonexistant, your resource comes in over time, and the more capture points you've secured the faster they come in. Simplistic. More room to focus on combat and tactical advances.  Hope this helps, just my opinions. GL HF"

It was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in Australia, Europe, Japan and North America in April 2010. In Japan, the game was released as NieR Gestalt (Japanese: „Éã„Éº„Ç¢ „Ç≤„Ç∑„É•„Çø„É´„Éà, Hepburn: Nƒ´a Gesutaruto ?) for the Xbox 360, while an alternate version entitled NieR Replicant (Japanese: „Éã„Éº„Ç¢ „É¨„Éó„É™„Ç´„É≥„Éà, Hepburn: Nƒ´a Repuricanto ?) was released for PlayStation 3 with a younger main character. The game is a spin-off from the Drakengard series, and follows the fifth ending of the first game, the events of which have left the planet Earth in a state of decay. Set over one thousand years after this, the game puts the player in control of the titular protagonist Nier, as he attempts to find a cure for an illness, known as the Black Scrawl, to which his daughter Yonah has succumbed. Partnering with a talking book known as Grimoire Weiss, he journeys with two other characters, Kain√© and Emil, as he attempts to find a remedy and understand the nature of the creatures known as Shades that stalk the world. The gameplay borrows elements from various video game genres, occasionally switching between them and the main RPG-based gameplay.

Double click Steam.exe and it will rebuild Steam and set it up in the new location.

AskGames,3825rw,LordCupcakeIX,2,Tue Jun 2 06:24:59 2015 UTC,"FFXIV doesn't really have two main raids, and they seem to be copying the formula with Heavensward coming out.  Binding Coil of Bahamut was the main raid when 2.0 released and continued as its story progressed until the last four fights released in 2.4, it is 8-man and it is tuned to approximately be as difficult as mid-tier heroic 10 man WoW bosses.  Going to require a steady group of people who have already cleared, but don't expect 100 wipes for progression either.  The Crystal Tower storyline, the other, 24-man raid is much more closely related to LFR.  It's essentially three, 8-man groups slapped together:  Even though it's one raid, each group gets its own individual loot and the fights are usually designed in a way so that each group splits up and works with itself (separating onto three platforms, focusing adds in your third of the boss ring, etc).  If you had an eight-person static group, you could do the eight-man raid (Alexander in the up-coming expansion) and then queue together and burn through the more casual experience raid."
AskGames,3825rw,LordCupcakeIX,2,Mon Jun 1 11:37:53 2015 UTC,"That's sounds promising.

But I didn't know it was an ""LFR"" raid and that ""the meat"" was in the 8m raid.  I read that they usually add another difficulty between raids which sounds great. SWTOR did this as well and I liked it.  If you don't mind me asking. How does gearing work? Are the drops from both raids the same item level? Will there be stuff I need from The Crystal Tower if I want to have BiS gear?  You might have sold me on FFXIV. I know there is a trial but I don't like leveling. I don't care or judge an MMORPG by its leveling/questing though. However, if there really isn't any other promising MMORPG, I might give it a try."
AskGames,3825rw,LordCupcakeIX,2,Mon Jun 1 12:07:00 2015 UTC,"They're chopping up how Alexander difficulty modes are going to work compared to BCOB.  All three sections of BCOB had one flat difficulty, with the exception of the 2nd Coil (bosses 6-9) which got a ""Savage"" difficulty added a patch later.  Savage isn't really 'heroic', it was designed to be actually cruel and almost unfair, but you get titles for clearing each of the fights.  The 9th boss was already far and away the hardest boss in the whole raid (the next patch included) and I don't wanna experience it on Savage.  They're claiming Alexander Hard will be harder than current Savage (so probably something on par with the harder 10man heroic bosses in WoW) and drop the highest item level of gear.  Alexander normal will probably be a little bit easier than regular BCOB was to make another casual-friendly option.   How does gearing work?   It goes in iLevel tiers.  There's an equivelant to Justice Points / Valor Points, with the JP-level marks being exchanged for dungeon level gear and the weekly-capped Valor points being exchanged for raid-level gear.  By the end of 2.0 it goes (generally):  Dungeons, iLevel 55-80  Tomestones of Soldiery (JP), iLevel 100 + upgradeable to 110  Tomestones of Poetics (VP), iLevel 120 + upgradeable to 130  World of Darkness loot (final CT raid), iLevel 120 not upgradeable  Final Coil of Bahamut (final BCOB raid), iLevel 130 not upgradeable  Turn 13 (final boss of BCOB), iLevel 135 weapon  with accessories and things being the various other 8-man one shot boss raids called Trials where you fight various summons.  Usually puggable, also an option for your dedicated raid to clear when they release for the loot or mounts.  BiS usually consisted of a mix of iLevel 130 gear from the raid, upgraded Poetics gear, sometimes a piece or two of World of Darkness gear if the secondary stats outmatched the bonus main stats on higher iLevel gear.  And then for extremely large amounts of gold, item level 110 gear could actually be socketed (melded) with materia in certain ways to be BiS or near-BiS, but I think they said they didn't like that system and it probably won't be in Heavensward."

AskGames,3803ot,GlassArrow,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:54:14 2015 UTC,"Letter Quest: Grimm's Journey  http://store.steampowered.com/app/328730/  Currently 5 to 8‚Ç¨, imho easily worth 10 for parents, definitely 5 for people who only play it casually but like the gameplay. http://isthereanydeal.com/#/page:game/drm?plain=letterquestgrimmsjourney  Core gameplay: You have to construct English words by clicking the available letters, using them up in the process if you confirm your choice. The game only accepts words from its database, but it seems to be quite big. The higher the word's score, the more damage you do to your immediate (comical) RPG opponent. There is no game world to explore, it's all very basic, though there is a map screen where increasingly more levels become available.  The store which has all kinds of upgrades which can be improved over time or upgrades that improve over time makes this quasi into a NewGame+ game like Rogue Legacy. A level or one of a level's challenge modes might have been too hard, but later you might be able to beat it. The entertainment value is surprisingly high, especially if you're not quite the player of a game of related sorts (Scrabble.) and improve your ability in this regard after a few hours of gameplay, making it more fun to play because 1) you're more able and 2) the same upgrades and everything would still allow you to get further than before.  Apart from the time trial modes that you have to explicitly invoke, you can ponder new words for hours before confirming your choice, so I would call that ""relaxed"" or ""relaxing"". Just turn off the game's music, listen to SomaFM's Drone Zone or Groove Salad or whatever, and smite by being smart."

AskGames,37j4y4,DARKSTARPOWNYOUALL,1 point,Thu May 28 15:09:46 2015 UTC,"Me and a friend were just as curious. We ordered real life copies off eBay (we couldn't find the game itself on sale anywhere) but really cheap obviously.  It stands now as my most played game on Origin. Got about 60 hours out of it, would have had more, but fell out of contact with my friend and because I had played the whole way through with him from the start, wasn't the same without him so I put it down.   I found it to be a really excellent ARPG with plenty of strategic depth and room for heaps of easy skill customization to suit your play.   We looked into why this game completely flopped, the gameplay was very unique, compelling and fun, both me and my friend couldn't possibly understand how it did so poorly based off what we had in front of us at the time (late last year). It wasn't a ""spore sequel"" as unknowledgable types in here are saying, it was a completely different style of game, being much closer to Diablo than Spore ever was, it just shared a lot of character aesthetic customizations that Spore had, although not as in depth, and not at all the focus of the gameplay like Spore was. I went through my entire 60 hours and barely even touched the character modifying thing, basically just did it to kill time when my friend was taking a piss or whatever. I don't think the people in here really know what they are talking about on this one.  The reason this game failed was for a few reasons, the biggest one being, it was online only, requiring a net connection even for single player, and while that is much more common these days, at the time it was one of the first games doing it. Look at how much negative press surrounded and hurt Diablo 3 for doing just this - except they did it a YEAR after this game was released, and had the name recognition of one of a legendary game series behind it, and the push of being a Blizzard game. Darkspore did not have this, and this completely sank the game as soon as it was released, and was possibly one of the stupidest dev decisions made that I could possibly think of. And while EA has stopped selling this game, they have not abandoned it, they are still paying to keep servers up.   I think if you are interested, grab it and sink a couple of hours into it, it's cheap as chips. My friend opened it first, we actually had it for a week or two and were sort of ""meh"" on starting it since we play other games, but one day I logged in and he was like dude you have to check this out, this game is actually awesome, he'd been playing it all day. For the first hour or so I couldn't really see it, it felt pretty simple, but then a couple of unlocks later I started understanding the game and it will always have a place in my heart for what could have been, and is still one of my favourite ARPGs played to date.  P.S. if you can find a friend to give it a go with you, I highly recommend doing so"

AskGames,37fc54,timz45,4,Wed May 27 05:26:06 2015 UTC,"While its level design is inventive and sometimes very threedimensional in its setup; the skill of the game is not about successfully managing to scale the level. That would rule out it being a platformer.  An action game's main purpose is to have you fight through a bunch of enemies. It doesn't have to be combat specific or even made for a mature audience. Games like Ratchet & Clank or even good old Crash Bandicoot left violence to a minimum, yet still satisfied the requirements for being an action game. They required immediate realtime actions by the player.  An adventure game has you explore a world. This can come in many forms. Either the world's lore is so diverse that you actively need to venture out and learn it. Or the game just allows for a lot of story wise padding. The question is, does playing the game (especially for the first time) feel like an experience, and is it enjoyable just to get to know more about the game's world? If so, it is an adventure game. Almost by definition, Alice in Wonderland (and derivations) is about you (as Alice) exploring the world and having experiences that are so foreign yet weirdly enjoyable.  So I would call Alice:MR an action adventure game."
AskGames,37fc54,Flater420,2,Wed May 27 06:52:40 2015 UTC,"I'd call it action adventure with platformer elements, more similar to Ratchet and Clank than to Mario.

Really any game would be better on PC just for the better graphics. You would likely need to build a PC for that, which is not hard, folks over at /r/buildapc can help. Or you can do console if you don't want to bother. Games are just pricier that way.  Also there are some fun lightweight pc games like League of Legends that you might find fun on your current laptop.  Games on whatever platform:   There is another batman game, Arkham City, very similar. If you liked Oblivion you would definitely like Skyrim. The Witcher 3 is open world like Oblivion and getting very good reviews. Haven't played it myself. The Witcher 2, while not open world, I really enjoyed. Fallout New Vegas would be good if you liked Fallout 3. Getting to be an older game, but might be able to pick it up for cheap.

Since I really only expect to buy a handful of games I think cost may still push it to the console's favor.  Thanks for the game pointers... The Witcher 3 looks like a winner. Bastion looks interesting, but I don't think it looks like my cup of tea.

You would probably want ""The Next-Gen Crusher"" or ""The Next-Gen Exterminator"", so around $450-$640. Keep in mind the prices don't include monitor/keyboard/mouse, since people often already have them. Don't take those as optimal builds, since parts are always going on sale, changing, etc. but it's a good reference.  Either way, enjoy the Witcher 3!

(Hit their arm and they'd lose the ability to use it.. .hit their head and they'd die.) The strategy was going for a faster weapon (that was less able to deflect a heavier one), or a slower weapon (that was less able to attack before taking damage from a lighter one).  Destiny got a lot of flak early on about one shot kills, but I'd imagine by now they patched it to oblivion.  It's never been popular."

Making a comeback when you're less than 3 hp out of 100 is exciting, but making a comeback after you've lost one arm and a leg is more so imo. Your disadvantage is portrayed in a tangible way and I think it makes for a better 'story' of the fight.

It's almost like a lightsaber fight, two minutes of clashing weapons and fighting for position, followed by a tag on their leg or their arm, then another minute of clashing before you hit them in the vitals.  Don't get me wrong, every now and then you'll come out and catch them perfectly and end the fight in seconds. But I'd say 3-5 minutes is closer to an average fight between equal opponents.

In Towerfall, you kill you opponents either by hitting them with an arrow or jumping on their head. You only have a limited amount of arrows, so you need to spend time running around collecting them, or by timing a dodge perfectly in the air, which allows you to grab a flying arrow. Various upgrades and level hazards also come into play.  Samurai Gunn is a little simpler - you kill your enemy either by slicing them with your sword, or shooting them with your very limited bullets.

It's very unsafe and can be a fire hazard. I also don't think two surge protectors in one outlet is a good idea either, but others may think differently.  Having all of those devices into one protector isn't bad. A good protector is meant to handle that many devices. I would recommend a monster brand power center.

AskGames,373god,Noeth,3,Sun May 24 15:48:34 2015 UTC,"With nvidia, it is a combination of the numbers. In 700 series, 7 is the generation (it isn't 7th generation, though, but the number is currently 7), and the second and third numbers are the iteration, higher being better. This causes some confusion. A 740 is not as good as a 660, though it is the next generation, but that is because it has the less powerful hardware of the 40 as opposed to the more powerful stuff used in the 60. 20-40 is entry level, usually, and 50-60 is mid range and 70-90 is high end. Then there's the M series which is used in laptops, which is usually a half or full ""generation"" behind. A 660m may only be as powerful as a 560 in the desktop versions. I'm being very general, so it is a bit inaccurate. However you can just google, ""nvidia 570 vs 670"" and usually a summary or graph will appear showing you how they compare. There's more to consider, also, as some come with more processor cores, different amounts of ram, or are over clocked to be more powerful. It takes a while to get into. I only learned by trial and error and reviews on newegg."

You need to make sure you are only checking the ones that your monitor can handle. If you are forcing 1080p (which hardly any games support anyway) it will default to 480i if your monitor does not support 1080p. I would try selecting 720p only and see if it works. Also make sure you set it to RGB instead of Limited range. I would assume your monitor is RGB. Otherwise leave it on Automatic. Good luck

AskGames,36z2sm,PunPuncher,4,Sat May 23 09:44:09 2015 UTC,"I consider the Uncanny Valley pretty much bunk, as things can look uncanny at any level of ""human likeness"". It's not something you fall into when you get more realistic or more technological advanced, quite the opposite most modern games today look far better then what we had 10 or 15 years ago, despite being far more realistic and they have consistently improved over that time period. The only real drop that there ever was in graphics, was 20 years ago when 3D graphics went mainstream and in retrospect old 2D games hold up a lot better then early 3D ones, but that was long before things looked ""human-like"".  That's not to say that certain games can't look uncanny, they certainly do, but they do so for relatively simple reasons, not for some mythical ""human-likeness"". A lot of it is just motion capture artifacts and lack of cleanup.  Essentially the Uncally Valley graph is complete nonsense and people can never agree if something is on the left the right or whereever. The reality look more like this, a narrow path of appealing graphics and when you misstep to much into the wrong direction things can go down the cliff into uncanny territory. But those missteps are not automatic and can be avoided or made at any point.  I see the whole Uncanny Valley as a classic case of confirmation bias."
AskGames,36z2sm,grumbel,2,Sat May 23 15:52:59 2015 UTC,"The goalposts of ""uncanny valley"" isn't the same from person to person. Some things I find creepy, other people find fine, and vice versa. Some games are good enough that some people are blown away by how real they look to them, others can see the flaws.   Currently I think we're at a point where games are noticeably digital still, but most people don't find the human characters freaky - good enough for immersion. Old games were harder to get ""in the zone"" as the human characters didn't look exactly human. Using GTA5 and my husband as an example, he notices when the animations are ""off"", which shows he's not feeling like the characters are ""off"" all the time.   So whilst games aren't truly photo realistic yet, I would personally argue that we are on the ""right"" side of uncanny valley."
AskGames,36z2sm,quenishi,2,Sat May 23 15:24:37 2015 UTC,"The guy is not wrong, how can you be wrong is saying that the uncanny valley factor is lower in this game because you see no other people?  No matter how LITTLE is off with human characters in other modern day video games, the fact is they are NOT real, so it cannot compare to not having any in your game to even recognize the un-realism to begin with. As it stands, P.T.'s graphics is pretty much top of the line for what's available on PS4 at the moment, so I'd say the guys right in saying ""we are moving above uncanny valley"", partly because of the quality, partly because of the nature of the game.  Also sidenote, your friend may have vision problems if he is being serious about this. While it would be awesome to be unable to distinguish the differences between characters in a video game and real life people, for the rest of us, 99% of the time you can just look at it and tell at a glance - as you said in your argument to him, it's not even close. I'd recommend he gets his eyes looked at, because either this is the kind of the guy who likes to be a contrarian about everything and argues it to the death like an idiot, or he has serious vision impairment.

AskGames,36z2sm,DARKSTARPOWNYOUALL,0,Sat May 23 15:32:39 2015 UTC,"I'd say the uncanny valley is the place where you can still tell it isn't real. I have yet to see a game that has actually fooled my eyes into thinking people are real. Photorealism is possible, but with human faces, our brains are specifically preprogrammed to see when something is ""off."" We can come incredibly close. Especially if prerendered. However, current games just aren't quite there yet. Perhaps in the next few years, but as of right now, no, I wouldn't be confident in saying we are already out of that valley.   As well, his eyes may be less sensitive or his brain less discerning, so to him, some high end games are good enough so that the faces look photorealistic to him. He may also be less strict on how he interprets the valley. IMO, if you can tell it isn't real just by looking, it's in the valley."

Smaller stories, smaller rosters, and tighter stories.  Then every now and then bring out something like Ultimate Alliance to bring everyone together against some massive threat.  But what most likely happened is that Marvel's focused on MCU right now, and if they make any games it'll be in support of that rather than drawing from the comics like the series did."

I'm on chapter two of Assassins of Kings and I'm REALLY glad I took the time to play the first game. The story in these games is pretty deep; I've been picking up on references and callbacks to characters and events from the first game constantly. I feel like I'd be missing out a lot by not having the frame of reference from playing the games from the beginning. My time spent as Geralt in the first game is making me care all the more about the events going on in the second. Most of the main cast of characters that you spend your time with also played major roles in the first game. There's a lot of history between characters that you would miss out on.  The Witcher 1 really shows it's age at this point, but if you can look past that and play through it I think you'd be glad you did once you start Witcher 2."

I recently posted about my FPS issues, but as the title suggests, something strange is happening to my game. I managed to get a solid 20 FPS after setting my resolution lower than 1080p (it's noticeably blurry, but hey, it's much more playable than 5 - 15 FPS), but after around 20 minutes of play time, my FPS tanks again to around 5 - 10. I feel as if my laptop is purposefully gutting the game's performance since it's so demanding (not really sure how this works - not really a techy). The following is a repeat of my previous post. I've also attached my specs below.  It's been around a week since I've had a Witcher, which I've mostly spent tweaking graphics settings and implementing small changes to achieve a playable FPS. I know ""help"" posts aren't very welcome, but after a few years of hype, constant browsing of the subreddit, and playing for 10 hours with absolutely brutal, Powerpoint-esque FPS, I'm getting kind of desperate.  I'm running the game on a NVidia GeForce GTX 670MX, which I've heard isn't ideal for the game, but users have managed to pull off a stable framerate at medium settings. I've tried every little graphical tweak I could find online, from settting all my graphics to the absolute lowest, manually updating my driver, setting draw distance to 1, capping FPS, killing NVidia's stream service, playing on fullscreen, hairworks off, etc. Oddly enough, I get the same FPS (~ 5 - 15) across all graphical settings, and none of the tweaks have produced any notable effect. Even though Witcher 3 is an immensely demanding game, it's the first game I've been unable to run on max settings  Laptop Specs 1 Processor/Memory  Any input would be greatly appreciated.

It was written by Edward¬†Hill, one of Novell's engineers in its European Development Centre (EDC) in Hungerford,¬†UK. Development had started in¬†1989.  NetWars¬†2.06 came bundled with Novell¬†DOS¬†7 and Personal¬†NetWare¬†1.0 in form of a single executable named NETWARS.EXE. It thereby replaced the text-based game NLSNIPES.EXE, that came with NetWare Lite 1.1 since 1991,  a newer implementation of the original Snipes, that traditionally came with Novell NetWare.  Since 1997, a much improved version 3 named Advanced¬†NetWars shipped with Caldera OpenDOS¬†7.01, DR-DOS¬†7.02 and DR-DOS¬†7.03.  It added support for SoundBlaster sound, Joystick control, up to six players in multi-player mode, missiles and computer-controlled ships in multi-player mode, and it featured a new multi-player shoot-out mode, an improved single-player mode, an external view mode, as well as a shape editor to design own¬†space-ships.  Despite all these additions, the executable maintained a file size of less than 77¬†KB.

My favorite space game is Kerbal Space Program. It's on the more realistic side than what you listed, but if you love building and space... it is a fairly safe bet. A huge bonus for the game is the thriving modding community, with some really expansive modding options for the game. Since you seem to be a huge builder, adding things like robotic parts and expanding on the space station construction aspects of the game I think would be right up your alley.  Another space building game is Space Engineers. I admittedly haven't played this game first hand, only watching video content on it. That said, looks like it's a pretty good space building game, allowing you to build ships and fly around. It's survival mode reminds me a bit of minecraft, building as you scourge up supplies. It is still in early access though, so who knows how the game will end, or when it will be properlly released.  I'm also a fan of the X-series. They are very in depth space management games. Think almost like a single played Eve. While there is combat, I personally found the game's strength to be in its economy. If you look into this game series, I would suggest staying away from the latest one, the older ones are just stronger games."

I'd say the closest to what I was looking for is the Space Base DF-9 game, which I wish they hadn't abandoned, honestly. Kerbal Space Program is a good game, as is Space Engineers, though I wouldn't be looking towards those simply because they're -purely- about building without the survival element (at least from what I've seen). The X-series is also great, and I have all of them, but I haven't been able to get into them.

AskGames,367zo2,doterobcn,4,Sun May 17 01:26:22 2015 UTC,"Probably because gamers can easily have consoles/computers to play games on at home, there's no real need for arcades."
AskGames,367zo2,Has_no_shirt,2,Sun May 17 03:09:47 2015 UTC,"Ok, but why didn't that happen in Asia?"
AskGames,367zo2,Deddan,3,Sun May 17 07:08:50 2015 UTC,"In Japan, for example, people live in much smaller houses or apartments than in the US. Having a home console system would take up precious space, particularly if you intended to have friends over to play as well. Arcades on the other hand give a social area for people to meet up and play games outside of the home.  It's also why the mobile and handheld market is doing so well in Japan. Small game systems, that can be played on the commute to work."
AskGames,367zo2,Satsumomo,1 point,Sun May 17 09:59:06 2015 UTC,"It's not really about the space, but more about the Japanese spending very little time at home.  The PS2 was still very popular in Japan, but with portable games gaining just as much depth as a home console, people just kinda migrated to portable consoles instead."
AskGames,367zo2,FallingSnowAngel,1 point,Sun May 17 22:42:49 2015 UTC,Because Japan has better arcades.  It also helps that their populations are not nearly as spread out as we are.

AskGames,365tho,_Ishmael,11,Sat May 16 12:44:29 2015 UTC,"Anything prior to IV is pretty dated and you're probably best avoiding them until you get a taste for JRPGs. You can't really go wrong with Final Fantasy VII. It's widely available and it's considered one of the best titles in the series. My personal favorites are FF6 and FF9, but they're a bit harder to find. Final Fantasy IV and X are excellent as well. I personally don't care for VIII, but people like it. There are also quite a few fans of V, but I've never played it so I can't comment on it. XII and XIII have a very, very different feel from the earlier titles in my opinion. Again, just my opinion -- A lot of people love them, but I won't comment much on them here because they're not my thing.  While the gameplay is pretty similar from game to game, the stories and influences of the games vary pretty widely, so I'll break it down like this for you.  Do you like...  Classic games from the late 80s? Play Final Fantasy I-III.  A challenging, man-in-conflict-with-himself adventure touching on the global effects of industrial imperialism? Play Final Fantasy IV.  Steampunk settings, crying, ensemble casts of well-written characters, The Joker from Batman, charming sprite graphics? Play Final Fantasy VI.  Cyberpunk, character-driven, analyses of the effects of crippling social insecurity, environmentally charged epics? Play Final Fantasy VII.  Pseudo time travel, coming of age, classic romances? Play Final Fantasy VIII.  Classical fantasy, introspective character analyses, whimsical epics with a lot of light comedy? Play Final Fantasy IX.  Daddy issues, sports, religion versus science? Play Final Fantasy X.  MMOs? Play Final Fantasy XII.  Anime? Play Final Fantasy XIII.  Chess, Game of Thrones, contemplating suicide after your finish a game with a soul crushing ending that makes you question why you even bother getting out of bed every day? Final Fantasy Tactics.  I've been playing these games since before I could read, so let me know if you have any questions and I'd be happy to answer them!"

Plus 10 has a sequel, so if you enjoy it you can keep playing in the same world before dabbling in the other games.  7 might be another good starting point, but some people are a little thrown off by the graphics, as they haven't aged nearly as well as 10."

It's from a genre of game called Incremental games (see /r/incremental_games ) The idea is.. yea, usually just ""keep clicking until you hit a wall (Point where buying any sort of upgrade takes forever, and the individual upgrades aren't doing much.) then reset/prestige/whatever to start over, but with bonuses!"" (In adventure capitalist, resetting gets you a certain number of ""angel investors"" depending on how far you got, these investors can be used to buy special, more powerful upgrades.) -- the idea is if you stack enough bonuses from prestiging, you'll eventually get to the point where you are flying past your ""wall"" without even slowing down, eventually getting farther, warranting more investors.  Adventure Capitalist (on kongregate, unsure about the mobile version) has a bit more than most, up to an including running a second game parallel once you ""unlock"" the moon for colonization, so it really never ends.  As for teh appeal, Iunno, I mostly use them because I can start it up at my desk at work, and kill the downtime clicking instead of redditing, and when I have to work, I can go back to a fat pile of idle cash."

AskGames,35v3il,nothing_in_my_mind,1 point,Sun May 17 15:13:18 2015 UTC,"I think you should look for a mentor, like a friend who plays a lot or maybe someone on here. I'd be willing to help if I still had my computer :(  I'm not the greatest at these games but I have an understanding of them. Overall, I'd say you should do some reading to learn all about the mechanics of how the games work, such as SC faction strengths/weaknesses, unit types and general strategies and build orders. For LoL, you'll want to learn about different heroes, roles and builds as well as strategies.    I also recommend watching a lot of streams on Twitch, analyzing high level play and picking up on tips and tricks you can use.    For LoL - my biggest noob advice would be to be patient. It's not a game where you go in guns/swords blazing and fight other heroes at the start. You need to push your lane, kill creeps and level up. Punish players who engage too early or get caught out of position. Maybe you should play someone like Vayne, and find a good support player to coach you a bit.    My best friend coached me in SC2 and it vastly improved my play. I went from Bronze to Gold in 2-3 weeks of dedicated play. Learning to manage both macro and micro level play is tough, especially when you aren't very familiar with the complexity of the game. Be sure to wall off your base and build a small defensive army early on to combat a rush. Don't let your minerals pile up, try to keep spending to keep up with your increased income.    You should always be building SCVs (terran) and make sure you are building supply depots and don't get supply capped.    I would google some build orders and try to nail down the timings on computer opponents. Make them second nature... learn your unit counters, basic strategies, remember to scout enemy bases. Keybind your facilities so you don't have to click around to produce units. etc.    it's all about research and practice. if you have an IRL friend who is really good, ask them to coach you while standing over your shoulder for a few games. Having someone yell ""MAKE SCVS!"" is a big help haha"
AskGames,35r2j2,Pacalakin,6,Tue May 12 20:27:16 2015 UTC,"I believe the term you're looking for is coined ""2.5D."""

AskGames,35r2j2,GlassArrow,5,Tue May 12 21:02:23 2015 UTC,"Ah I think the term might actually be ""billboarding"" according to this wikipedia article (see the ""Application"" section): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_%28computer_graphics%29    The difference is, unlike games like Doom where the 2D sprites are always facing you, in Paper Mario they face other directions so you see that they're only 2D.

AskGames,35pimv,go_destroy,5,Tue May 12 13:27:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know about others, or how heavy the hype is for this game because I don't buy into that sort of talk, but I'll tell you from my perspective why I'm really looking forward to The Witcher 3.  For starters, the biggest draw is the characters. I'm getting the feeling you didn't play all the way through, because if you did you'd probably already know the answer - Geralts a fucking badass with a heart and his background is so compelling - both games could have sucked and I'd still want to pick up #3 to see more of this excellent character and his band of friends, all of which have tons of personality ingrained into their characters.   However, the gameplay DOESNT suck. Yeah, the combat is kind straight forward, but it didn't need to be too much more. It's not a major draw of the game, but to me it was passable and fun, and was more influenced by your preparation and research than anything else by using the right potions. And THIS is the second big draw to the game - the way a lot of things required a lot of thought. We've mentioned combat, but completing quests, making dialogue decisions, progressing through areas - there was a lot of op thinking involved (often enough it had to be a little out of the box as well), and this is something pretty uncommon in today's ""follow quest marker X and grind up skills to improve"" type of RPGS. I like these ones too, but Witcher was very different.  Then of course there is the world. We have these gorgeous backdrops to the story and really fleshed out locations, a lot of work went into designing every area aesthetically, even if the map designs can be pretty straight forward as you said. The people of this world, the lore of it hidden everywhere, the creative monsters, the factions, the struggles and motivations of the people, i may as well transition this into the driving that takes us through this world, and that is the story. Man oh man, the story. It's action packed, deep, amazing characters, and really hard choices, it's so easy to empathise with everyone and quite often there is no right answer. Its really well written entertaining, and smart, and really - I want to find out what happens to Geralt in number 3. I'd honestly be just as excited for a visual novel at this point, I'm not going to give any spoilers, but I really want to follow this man throughout his journey it's very compelling.  Speaking of the graphics, the graphics for #2 were really nice when they came out. What I have seen of number 3 looks really good. As for the graphics being advertised not being the final product, well actually you haven't seen the final product, so it's still just graphics being advertised at this point, I prefer to take that kind of final product speculation based on the differences between two gameplay videos it with a grain of salt, the development process is an unstable thing, and we will see how it looks on release. Regardless, I did see the thread on it, and reddits response was far from ""all good"" about it and most people seem to be shitting a brick once again. But info is scarce and nobody still knows how it will look on release,so it's a bit early to get all up in arms about it just yet.  But basically to sum it up, ""generic looking"" might be accurate. ""Generic"" is not, very much the opposite."

I will say that initially I did find the games hard to get into, especially the first one, and honestly at first had similar questions to your own.

Every time I go to IGN it's just a list of stories about Witcher 3 and I didn't understand why it's being so pumped.

AskGames,35pimv,UwasaWaya,4,Tue May 12 15:16:29 2015 UTC,"linear to me is lack of player options. When a game feels like the dev is just guiding you along is linear to me.   Witcher 2 literally does not have a waypoint or Quest Objective on Map system, so not sure about being guided besides 'stay near this town.' You are welcome to wander away from town but the quests are not set up like in Assassins Creed etc.   I have not played the souls serious. I'm sure it's great but the player focus on difficulty has been off putting.    I mentioned it because the combat pace to me feels familiar - nvm!   rpg combat can be a variety of things. My favourite combat in an rpg has been Kingdoms of Amular, but I feel like no one has played that.    Lucky for you I have! Witcher is nothing like KoA combat, which is closer to games like God of War, or Bayonetta, or Dark Siders over the shoulder floating button mashing. I call them games that kill controllers - if you use one. Nothing to discuss here lol - the combat is just completely different. Looks more fluid in W3 though. From the interviews and such combat was one of the main things they looked into.   my favourite RPGs have been the Bethesda games. First one I played was Morrowind and I've played every other Bethesda RPG since with Fallout 3 being my favourite. I've played every Final Fantasy, either at release or on emulator. The most recent RPG I've played is FF14 but that's an mmo.    Again with the different kinds of games. Witcher combat is more reactive. In the world of MMOs it falls closer to TERA, and Guild Wars 2. If a guy swings at you and you move your ass out of the way you can dodge it. It is going to feel VERY different from Bethesda games. FF14 combat is kinda similar, but only to a degree - no action bar in W3 :)"

AskGames,35ceds,loving_embrace,3,Fri May 8 23:28:29 2015 UTC,"I'm enjoying it a lot. Blizz has done a lot to make a diverse set of characters (like seriously, over 100 champs in LoL, and HotS still has things they haven't done), and while there are a few balance issues, it's pretty good in that regard.  I remember when LoL and HoN came out, and HoN/DotA players looked down on LoL for being a simpler game (no denying)--well, HotS is another step in that direction. No gold, no reason to last hit, exp is shared across a team. Outside of 'be in lane to soak exp from creeps dying', the game is entirely objective based. No items, you get talents to specialize your abilities as you level. Comebacks are much more common than LoL.  Although I've heard otherwise from a few other people, I've run into very, very few bugs. The game plays perfectly for me. I have friends that have had issues with stability though, so I guess I'm just the one of the lucky ones.  I don't feel like it has LoL's depth--the lack of items means it's a lot harder to adapt to a game as it progresses--but it's a lot of fun, and much better for quick casual matches."
AskGames,35ceds,lincolnsgold,2,Sat May 9 04:55:22 2015 UTC,"Nice response. Thanks.  What does ""comebacks"" mean in this context? I haven't played this genre very much."

AskGames,35ceds,lincolnsgold,1 point,Sat May 9 07:31:21 2015 UTC,How would you compare the comebacks with DotA?
AskGames,35ceds,tempusnet,1 point,Sat May 9 11:12:12 2015 UTC,"Haven't played DotA, so I can't really answer that.  But generally speaking: I have found very, very few matches to be completely one-sided. There's a few built-in comeback mechanics; you get more exp for kills when you're behind, and if you're extremely behind, you passively gain exp (realistically, you don't ever get that far behind, I've only seen it against bots). Death timers get very long, around the 20 minute mark. And because there's no gold, and exp is shared across your team, an exp advantage doesn't mean that much outside of the power spike every few levels when you get a new talent.  So big picture: Even if you're behind, as long as you can catch up to your opponents' last power spike, you can definitely win a fight that will turn the game around. Each map has a unique objective that's meant to attack enemy bases, too, so managing to get control of that goes a long way towards pulling out a win."

AskGames,35btyy,Thoughtist,1 point,Sat May 9 09:10:55 2015 UTC,"Sentinel looks just real slow due to hardware limitations of the platform,   The thing that makes Sentinel interesting is that it is build around that limitation. The player can only rotate it's head around, but not freely move around. And rotating the head is reasonably fast as the game essentially just scrolls the screen and doesn't need to rerender the whole scene. Freescape in contrast looks like a full on 3D engine with free movement that just runs very slow."

AskGames,356va6,FPJarva,3,Thu May 7 16:27:56 2015 UTC,"Seems like you have well-loved SP games with little or no time played - HL, Bioshock  I can say the Company of Heroes games are great if you love the genre.  The first game's main campaign (let alone when you get into DLC and sequels) takes a lot of time, and then there is great replay value with both SP and MP game modes.  Crusader Kings is something you could spend a LOT of time on, but it's a steep learning curve.  Fallout NV is great and immersive.  Insurgency is a solid FPS that's on the more tactical side.  Has a small but growing and very acessible competitive scene if you're into that.  Sniper Elite V2 is a pretty fun way to pass some time.  I enjoyed my SP playthrough.  Civ V is one of my most played games (and Civ in general).  Personally, I prefer V to IV, but many prefer IV.  Either way, it's a great game.  Basically I just went through your list and listed the ones that jumped out at me, so hopefully you can at least narrow it down based on your mood, though that's still a lot to choose from!

AskGames,356va6,Stokkolm,2,Thu May 7 19:25:34 2015 UTC,"Here's a list of your games that you've played less than 1.5 hours of that I think you should play.   Bioshock - Great game that kicked off a great franchise. This is considered the best in the series by many players. Fallout New Vegas - Not as good as Fallout 3 in my opinion, but that's debatable. Still a great game with a great story line. Just Cause 2 - Open world destruction and ridiculousness. The world is huge and you can do tons of badass stuff. Install the multiplayer mod for more mayhem. Darksiders - If you're into sword-based dungeon crawlers, this one is quite well done. Warframe - If you like Mass Effect's multiplayer mode, this game is awesome. It's worth a try even if you haven't played ME. This style of multiplayer is unlike any other FPS multiplayer I've played, in a very good way. Civilization V - I'm not a fan of these types of games, but everybody seems to be talking about how great Civ V is. Half-Life 2 - How have you not played this? This is one of the greatest games of all time, in my opinion. It came out in 2004 and was the #1 game on metacritic until GTA V for PC was released 11 years later. Download the free Half-Life 2: Update mod for the ultimate bug fixes and cool commentary. All the other half life stuff - If you liked HL2, just play all of it. It's all pretty great. Left 4 Dead - My favorite zombie survival game until the sequel came out. Hop into a match online with other survivors and enjoy. There are also a ton of mods for this to make it as horrifying or hilarious as you like. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic - This has been one of my favorite games for a long time. It is an old, yet very well done RPG with a dynamic story. Choose to be good, choose to be evil, or let your feelings for the characters choose for you. I highly recommend this game, especially if you are a Star Wars fan.   Honorable mentions:   Thomas Was Alone - This is a simple puzzle-style platformer with a very unique story. The narration gives life to these faceless blocks who help each other get through to the end of each level. I actually caught myself getting feelings for these cute quadrilaterals. Mind: Path to Thalamus - This game is similar to Myst in that it is puzzle-based, however I found the puzzles in this game much easier comparatively. And they really don't need to be super hard puzzles (not that they're easy). The story is very mysterious and intriguing and keeps you wanting to find the next piece of dialogue.    The other games I either haven't played, haven't enjoyed, or don't feel comfortable giving a good recommendation. I hope this helps. You have a lot of great titles."

I'll give Just Cause 2 a shot, when I tried it out I never got the hang of it but I'll give it another go.  I've forgot about Darksiders, I started it, enjoyed it and then after taking quite a long break, forgot about it. I will definitely finish the first one and then play the second depending on my enjoyment of the first.  Never tried Warframe, not generally a fan of F2P games, I can't remember why I installed it.

I'm a huge Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic fan, I never played it on PC but on the original XBox I easily had over a 1000 hours on it, and about the same amount of time on the second one, I honestly want another similar to them.  I've had Thomas Was Alone recommended by a friend before but never got round to trying it, I'll definitely make some time to try it now.

AskGames,355kcz,JoeFajita,4,Thu May 7 08:06:18 2015 UTC,"I don't remember any gaming-focused mice or keyboards in that era. Gaming was a very different thing then; professional PC gaming didn't really start in earnest until the turn of the century (Fata1ity got his start in 1999), and there was little market in making gaming-focused peripherals (outside of stuff like joysticks).  Razer's first mouse, the Boomslang, was in fact a mechanical though--it was released in 1998."

Rev2 has a ranking system, I don't think Evil Within does but I can't quite remember. Then Rev2 is heavily focused on the two character system, though Evil Within has the occasional AI partner.

While similar to the previous Witcher games, Wild Hunt has improved on several aspects from past games. Combat revolves around an action role-playing game system combined with the use of magic. The fighting system has been completely revamped.  Wild Hunt introduces some new mechanics, such as witcher-sense, combat on horseback, and at sea, swimming underwater, and using a crossbow. Additionally, Geralt can now jump, climb, and vault over smaller obstacles. The climbing mechanics have been described as ""not exactly"" like Assassin's Creed, but more ""similar to what we have in Uncharted.""

AskGames,34vxjk,TheGreatOneRock,0,Sat May 23 14:43:53 2015 UTC,"I'll try to answer you taking you seriously even tho you are just rude and uneducated.  It takes around 365 games to hit level 30, which equates to around 240 hours, so non stop playing for 10 days of your life. Definitely doesn't feel like farming :). And before you start telling me about ""yes but you lurn the game"", some players might be veterans of other mobas or simply good and feel the game unchallenging.  Also, some people don't have too much time for playing and getting to level 30 would take them almost 8 months at one game a day.  Just to start playing not with levelling players, this is atrocious 10 days straight of farming xp.  This amount of games is going to give you around 36000 IP. Let's say you need atleast 3 rune pages.  Two are default iirc so you just need to buy one for 3150 (when I still played that was the price). This leaves you with 32850 IP.  A generic page will be 3075 for the quintessence, 1845 for marks, 1845 for glyphs, 1845. That's 8610 per rune page. I think that a MINIMUM of 3 pages is mandatory and even counting that AP and AD share armor and mr glyphs and seals it's 22140 IP for runes.  We are left with 10700 IP for champions. That's it, we have none of them for ranked games (ok tritana and alistar, which I believe are not really that played now).  The average cost of a LoL champion is more than 3800.  Ofcourse you could buy 15 champions as cheap as possible and play, no doubt if you are good you would climb with no matter what, but fact is that some champs are better than others in ranked games.  Based on Lolking the best 3 champions per role by winrate, ranked solo, for each role are Heimer+ Malzahar + Ahri, which combined cost is 12'750; Sejuani, Amumu and Nunu, 5'700; Janna, Leona, Sona for 9300, Jinx Ashe and Vi, 13'050, Wukong Tryndamere and Fiora (lol) for 13'400.  So after all of these calculations we find out that we need 240 hours just to get to level 30.  25'190 IP just for 3 rune pages and only with basic runes, even counting using mr and armor for all champs.  Now if we want the most effective champions for ranked games, we need to spend 64'000 IP.  I'm assuming also that 3 champions per role is the bare minimum to play ranked (and it might not be enough due to bans and enemy picks and very toxic teammates with attitudes like yours).  I'll also skip the obvious part where you need to have some experience with some champions to play versus them which relies on the RNG of free champion rotation.  So after we count all of that just to start decently we need around 100k ip (equivalent to 1000 games) to start rankeds.  Well, you could always just get cheaper champions, I agree, but this does not change the fact that the game is very farm based to allow you to play competively (joining a team even for fun with a limited champion pool is just a no since you limit the comps of your team). Meanwhile on DotA all of this stuff is free and unlocked from the start with only cosmetics being part of the game.  Now, to my part.  I started playing on US server even before season 1 started and I was one of those players that complained when EU opened and Riot lied about the impossibility to transfer on EUW so I had to climb to level 30 again and rebuy all the stuff.  My ID on NA was Cricetola, which I later sold, plus I had another account which I didn't maxed named Jauntymal.  On EUW my nicks have been Aquazi (banned in season 3) and Crie. I left LoL during Season 3.  During Season 2 I made some LoL videos on youtube like this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6eIg_mqhM  I never reached anything higher than Plat 3 I think and I quit since after 7'000 (or more) games I was pretty tired of the game.  That's all, bye and good luck."
AskGames,34vxjk,Hagtzel,0,Sat May 23 14:59:07 2015 UTC,An account takes like max 80hr to reach level 30 and by that time you can easily have 15 champs  Rune pages were always of 6.3k  All calculations look shady most probably they were copied from some other posts  Not that i care anymore

AskGames,34vla3,Frank_Castle1980,2,Mon May 4 22:41:24 2015 UTC,"It was only fairly recently that Marvel re-claimed their licenses. Before that, it was up to individual publishers to cash in. Captain American: Super Soldier is actually pretty great and fairly Arkham-esque, in its own way, in a somewhat brief-but-fun romp.  X-Men Origins: Wolverine is great, too, though it was originally meant to be a generic Wolverine game, not a movie tie-in.  Amazing Spider-Man 1 (and not too) is decent, too.  Deadpool was the last game to be released before the reclamation of the properties, and now it's unbuyable because of that.  Marvel vs. Capcom 3 also cashed-in on the Avengers better than previous games, but now it shares the same fate as Deadpool.  But yeah, I'm really surprised there's not a Guardians of the Galaxy game etc... maybe after getting burned by awful tie-in titles, studios and consumers are a little too wary of tie-ins, unless it's LEGO.  Then again, it might be as asinine as the fact that the bean-counters figure there's more profit in phone games than in big-budget console games.  I'd kill (or at least blind a guy) for a Daredevil game based on the new series."
AskGames,34vla3,Nawara_Ven,2,Mon May 4 23:00:29 2015 UTC,I actually loved the Wolverine game.  I probably replayed that at least 6 different times and beat it.  I must have missed the Cap game somehow.  I tried the Deadpool game out.  picked it up in a steam sale.  glad i bought it on sale...

AskGames,34vla3,dewsh,2,Tue May 5 12:33:29 2015 UTC,"Like /u/Nawara_Ven said, Marvel/Disney re-claimed their licenses and did not follow up on any contract renewals.  Disney Interactive lost 200 Million a year between 2008-2012 so this shouldn't be a surprise.  They closed 3 studios during this time including LucasArts in 2013.  Disney has pretty much got out of the big games business with a renewed focus on mobile and ""toys to life"" genre only.  We will probably only see MCU tie ins on mobile devices.  Fox properties can be optioned out to other studios based on a movie tie in.  I'm not sure about Sony considering the new deal.  Now why is this happening?  My opinion - games were cheaper to make making a move tie in a cash grab.  Game production prices have raised and in the age of mobile devices a lot of people who would have bought the title on name alone now have their attention somewhere else.  The age of quick cash grab tie ins for modern consoles is done.    Marvel Heroes is a Free to play diablo like game, PC only.  This might scratch your Ultimate Alliance itch.  I haven't been able to play it so no thoughts on the quality"

AskGames,34tsl5,swayze_crayze,7,Mon May 4 14:32:54 2015 UTC,"Personally speaking I would wait a bit longer even still before picking it up. All indicators point to it going free2play fairly soon, within a year I would be willing to bet.  They never should have had 3 ways of making money in the game, the sub, the paying for the game, and the cash shop, all at once, it turned a lot of people off to it and made them not even consider picking it up. You're really only allowed to do 2 of those in most games.  Now that they've dropped the sub it's more or less acceptable, but people have been turned off to it already, and it's hard if not impossible to re-entice people who have already made up their mind.  Anyways, you asked how it was: Well, it's okay, it's more or less the same now as when it had a sub, there's problems playing with friends, it's very hard to do some quests becuase monsters only spawn so often and there's almost always someone else doing the same quest as you, and for some reason the outside world is instanced but caves aren't??? they did it backwards??? why???  The bottom line is that it's a mediocre WoW-era style MMO. A lot of it's designs are relics of an older time, and personally speaking it feels like a lot of the game simply isn't up to the standards I'd expect, I mean the goddamn UI looks like it was slapped together in 10 minutes!  All-in-all, I wanted to love elder scrolls online, but unless they pull a Final Fantasy and completely redesign the game, I don't see it ever being more than a small distraction for a few hours.  Most of what is said in this video still holds true, for a general idea of how the game is this is pretty spot on:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTQMINsV170"

AskGames,34tsl5,Robot_xj9,2,Mon May 4 18:42:31 2015 UTC,"It's really a crying shame, becuase had they been able to see what the players actually wanted, and made some very minor tweaks, it would have been amazing. I want to love it, and I hope one day I'll be able to."

AskGames,34tsl5,tylrbrock,0,Mon May 4 19:43:20 2015 UTC,Whose to say Bethesda would have done it better? They've never made an MMO either.
AskGames,34tsl5,Robot_xj9,0,Tue May 5 08:33:55 2015 UTC,I think the console release will revive it. There has yet to be a worthy MMO on console. And now that there is no sub fee it will attract everyone on console that wasn't for it. DC universe sucks and FF is an acquired taste. I have a feeling this will be more successful on console then PC.  And most peoples complaints about this game are petty mostly.

I don't know, people do like to throw around a lot of petty complaints but there are plenty of real complaints about elder scrolls, like the fact that you have to get out of your starting area to play with friends, and even then sometimes playing with friends doesn't work becuase they're phased out or something or not on the same channel??? why did they do it like this ??? playing with friends is the point of an mmo??? I am so confused help."
AskGames,34tsl5,Robot_xj9,1 point,Tue May 5 15:12:49 2015 UTC,No COD if for playing with friends. An MMO is for playing a vast world with multiple people. To bring a world more to life.   The reason you can't play with your friends in different factions. Is just that. Different factions. How are you supposed to jump all over this world and connect quest and storylines.   Like I said petty complaints.   You can't play with your friends because they are in a different faction start a new character then. You find this out in the first 30 minutes are you know if you read anything about this game. Hell it probably tells you this as you make your character.   That really has nothing to do with this game is good or not.

Oh, I see attempting to have an in-depth discussion with you is pointless, silly me. Sorry for distracting you from your COD, why don't you grab some mountain dew and doritos and forget this whole thing."
