CrazyHand,3e4txj,Poyoarya,0,Wed Jul 22 01:36:37 2015 UTC,"Crouch cancelling only works In melee, project m, and smash 64"
CrazyHand,3e4txj,jllmprrt,2,Wed Jul 22 02:40:05 2015 UTC,"Not true at all. It does work, but the knockback is downscaled only to 6/7, making it pretty much useless."
CrazyHand,3e4txj,Poyoarya,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:59:16 2015 UTC,"Zero said he got out of Nairo's Fsmash in Winner's Finals of EVO by crouch canceling and then SDIing, so not exactly useless."

CrazyHand,3e4txj,Poyoarya,2,Wed Jul 22 03:06:48 2015 UTC,ok sorry I didn't know that. 6/7 is pretty much useless so unless with extensive testing no one would know that.
CrazyHand,3e4txj,jllmprrt,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:16:23 2015 UTC,There are two different types of crouch cancel. There is a true crouch cancel and ASDI down. A true crouch cancel is when you have already gone through the crouch animation and are in a true crouch before you get hit. ASDI down is when you get hit then hold down so you get sent down into the stage instead of away which puts you on the ground faster and doesnt send you very far.
CrazyHand,3e5u74,peperc2,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:39:37 2015 UTC,It depends on each character really. Can you be a little more specific?
CrazyHand,3e5u74,lol_gog,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:06:24 2015 UTC,"Well, it's like a mental game of chicken. If Player A goes for the grab, and Player B spot-dodges it, B can then get some jabs or a tilt in. However, if A knows B's habits well enough, he can drop shield and B will spot-dodge on reaction, allowing A to predict and punish hard with a smash attack. B might think of this and so go for the grab preemptively if he knows that A tends to keep shield up and won't spot dodge, or tilt a few times to apply shield pressure (depending on spacing), or jump out of shield to bait the shield-grab; and so forth. There's a huge range of possibilities, and it's very character dependent since the frame-data for different moves varies wildly between jabs, tilts, and whatnot. It also relies a lot on your knowledge of the opponent, and combines one's reactive and predictive abilities."
CrazyHand,3e5u74,Radicool21,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:35:41 2015 UTC,"Any number of things could happen. One or both players could see their opponent's shield and rush for the grab. One or both players could throw out an attack, expecting the opponent to grab (and thus expose themselves to damage). One or both players could disengage. Or both of them could stay in shield, waiting for the other to commit before choosing a counter-option. Which option the players choose is a product of the character, situation and mind games at play."
CrazyHand,3e64am,SawtoothRaven,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:26:53 2015 UTC,"With mario try spacing a jump right below the opponent with your back facing them. As soon as they throw out a dodge, jump and throw out a back air."
CrazyHand,3e4fgw,D14BL0,2,Tue Jul 21 21:45:03 2015 UTC,"A good bread and butter setup is back throw off the ledge, down-b spike, can't remember the percentages for the life of me though. It only fails if they DI away, which is rare because most will have either no DI or DI in. When you can get the bread and butter ones easily, using the spike freeform will be more natural."

CrazyHand,3e3pqx,TheBlackLuffy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:46:37 2015 UTC,I don't play yoshi but I know there's this thing called tregging where you use up b on the stage close to the ledge to trump your opponent. The opponent usually ends up getting popped up right where the egg will be. So now your opponent is in hit stun behind you giving you a free back air punish.  Edit: tregging was removed.
CrazyHand,3e3pqx,TheMaroonAxeman,3,Tue Jul 21 18:58:49 2015 UTC,Tregging was patched out :(
CrazyHand,3e3pqx,8bitfusion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:02:01 2015 UTC,"Yoshi's recovery is great, but easily gimpable. Weird. Use his double jump armor to easily avoid spikes, but make sure he mixes up whether h recovers to the ledge with egg, without egg, or to the stage. Using an egg at the ledge pops you above the lip and makes you vulnerable. You typically want to use egg before jump when recovering.  B-reversed egg lay is a great mix up tool an confirms into an upsmash. You can even try an egglay regrab.  Fair spike onstage also leads into up air. His spike is stupidly easy to land, so try retreating fairs."
CrazyHand,3e3pqx,8bitfusion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:06:38 2015 UTC,"The only thing I can think of is b reverses, I get a lot of kills with his down b and catch people by surprise with his neutral b."

Mixing it up with spot dodges and rolls will definitely help with your punishing. You're also faced away very often, so it may help to practice some out-of-shield pivots.   Also Lucario's FF Nair is really awesome, which you can add to the repertoire."
CrazyHand,3e3res,Wally_the_Walrus_Kin,7,Tue Jul 21 18:57:44 2015 UTC,"it's pretty hard and not worth the effort, but you can do it.  if you are on stage and opponent is off stage, try and think of your tink dair spike as links dtilt spike. When you dair with tink you want to stay on the stage, but kind of half off the stage. Make the sword line up with the end and you can try and kill if they try to recover from the bottom-up.  that's the only safe way I know to not die with dair."
CrazyHand,3e3res,RedRadawan,4,Tue Jul 21 19:08:28 2015 UTC,I've seen it done on battlefield and its omega form because of how thin the ledge is. Just do it on the ledge and it can hit people below the lip of the stage if you time it right. I miss the Brawl pogo stick dair.
CrazyHand,3e3res,Electrical_Beast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:12:45 2015 UTC,"Tink, I'm not sure, but above 50% you can do it with Link guaranteeing a kill so maybe higher for Tink.  When you connect the dair, jump (move upwards), then up-B or do a tether recovery onto the ledge (7 frames for ledge vs 23 for Up-B). You're reversing your momentum upward so you gain that precious height to recover. It also needs to be not too much down below or you won't have time to save yourself.  That said, triple jab-dair is a nasty kill combo."

It can get pretty predictable so don't spam it. Homing attack is situational but can be used to get around/punish moves with a lot of endlag (e.g. pk fire). If a ness tries to give you his mixtape, shorthop -> homing attack to show him how to go fast! Good luck :)"
CrazyHand,3e2czf,PhyrexianBear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:29:09 2015 UTC,"I do those things, and they'd do help, but they get predictable and my opponent punishes me if they're good enough.

CrazyHand,3e2czf,BlackPhantomBP,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the homing attack is very wonky.  Alternatively, you could use it to finish the side-b -> aerial combo, I find it works pretty well. Try to be careful with your approaches, baiting the opponent by empty jumping out of a spin dash can get them to throw up a shield. Sonic's down throw also sets opponents up for a spin dash. If you find yourself getting shield-grabbed a lot, then try to avoid dash attacking and rushing your opponent."
CrazyHand,3e2czf,BlackPhantomBP,0,Tue Jul 21 17:16:29 2015 UTC,"I never thought using the Homing Attack like that. I'll try that. I love to use his up throw followed by up air followed by Spring followed by up air. I use his down throw to throw someone off stage and then try to gimp with a Spring to people who don't air dodge.  Also by empty jumping out of Spin Dash, should I empty jump in place, or should I go towards the opponent to bait?"
CrazyHand,3e2czf,TheSkedaddle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:22:01 2015 UTC,"I would empty jump towards the opponent, it allows you to capitalize on their shield more easily.

CrazyHand,3e1d2d,RomyTono,2,Tue Jul 21 09:11:51 2015 UTC,"Ganondorf's best move is to wait for the opponent to make a mistake, unless the opponent is another heavy, or the player is bad.

Taking a game that's based on 1/10 of a second reactions and throwing it into an online environment full of heavy input delay and regular lag is just ridiculous. If you want to get better, play your friends as much as possible, especially if they are better than you. Don't rush your gameplay too much, learn what every type of input does, and try to learn the ramifications of all the other character's attacks. Like a lot of other people are saying, this game is really about time and practice. But in the end, nothing will be as beneficial as playing locally. That said, playing a lvl 9 cpu is definitely good for at least one thing: practicing reflexes. Those things are fast. Crazy fast.

CrazyHand,3e1n84,aweusmeuh,2,Tue Jul 21 07:14:23 2015 UTC,"Well you actually just need to practice, play with the cpu and on for glory too. After you can beat all characters with any character on lvl 9 then you should focus more playing with humans. Also play with every character at least a few times. If you want to reall be prepared, understand everything a character can do with its moveset, for example: peach can pull out a bomb or a mr saturn instead of a turnip sometimes; mr game and watch puts an apple if he hits with a 7 to a character; bowser can break a shield with downb, etc, etc. Its not hard to learn all, since they can be categorized by shield brakers, spikes, kill moves, combo starters, random properties, etc, etc. The more you know the better you play.

I've played previous iterations of Smash before, so maybe my method is flawed, but playing a lot, and not quitting after losing (or barely winning) has helped me go from not winning on FG much, to barely finding competition on it. I also made it a thing to implement pivoting, short hopping, and fast falling to my game. I would make sure to never incessantly roll, spot dodge, or air dodge. Even if that was the only way I could win, I still wouldn't do it, because I knew that to get to that next level of play I had to practice those ""advanced techniques"" until I could do them without much fail."

CrazyHand,3e1lai,SuperNanoCat,2,Tue Jul 21 06:43:04 2015 UTC,"Pit/Dpit or Marth/Lucina  Pit fares well (slightly disadvantaged to advantaged) against all the characters that give Palutena trouble, and is particularly useful against Luigi and Diddy.  Marth/Lucina do well against Link/Tlink (the only projectile based users who give Palutena trouble) and are particularly useful for Luigi (Marth), Rosalina (Marth), Sheik/Diddy (Marth or Lucina), Fox (Lucina)  These characters don't exactly have an advantage over Falcon, but may be better than Palutena since Falcon is pretty hard for her. For example if he counterpicks FD, then you may want to go Pit since he has a great grab game that can match Falcon's horizontal gameplay, where as Palutena would have trouble approaching him. If your Palutena isn't cutting it but you can play on BF/Dreamland, then Marth/Lucina might be worth a try. Take note that Marth/Lucina can really take advantage of Falcon's mediocre recovery quite easily without much practice.  Pit is good against Luigi because of his greater horizontal mobility and he has a quick Nair to use as a combo breaker. His attacks have more range than Luigi and you have arrows to force him to approach. With a good shield dash, down B, side B, and arrows, you have many ways to deal with his fireballs. His grab game and good shield dash are very helpful to counter Luigi's approaches with your own grab. In this MU Luigi will have trouble approaching as he is slower, and he will also have trouble recovering due to how deep Pit can go off stage and how much lenience he has in terms of timing his edgeguard (can just jump around until he's close and throw out any attack to gimp him, and then Up B back to stage without much worry)  Furthermore, these characters don't require a high amount of technical skill, making them good compliments to Palutena. Their relatively low usage would also benefit you over picking someone like Sheik as a secondary.  The only character left that Palutena can have trouble against that may not be covered by either Pit or Marth/Lucina is Pikachu. Pit and Marth/Lucina may have trouble against Pikachu too, but at least you'll have an extra option or be able to switch up your character so he'll have to re-figure you out during a match."
CrazyHand,3e1lai,YoshiKirishima,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:34:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice!  I'll give Pit and Marth a shot.  Any particular reasons why Marth is so good against Weegee and Sheik?
CrazyHand,3e1lai,YoshiKirishima,2,Tue Jul 21 23:01:01 2015 UTC,"For Luigi: His dash/grab game isn't as good as Pit's, but it's still good. A fast walk with use of shield is a good substitute for moving around without worrying about fireballs restricting you, and in general for spacing. Luigi and Mario both lack range, and Marth is good at abusing that with spaced attacks both on the stage and edgeguarding off stage. Due to Luigi's low mobility, and Marth's Dancing Blade, you do well at stopping and punishing rolls (19% with DB down variation per roll).  Against Sheik, your dolphin slash is hard to edgeguard, making one of Sheik's good ways of killing (bair hitbox at the ledge) less relevant. Sheik, despite having many ways to kill, not uncommonly has trouble finishing you off quickly, resulting in lots of rage for Marth. With marth's high base knockback moves (especially tipper fsmash), this makes it very scary for Sheik and always allows the Marth a chance of making a big comeback, especially in the 2 stock metagame. With a good walk, a decent grab, and a good solid punish (DB down variation) in neutral, you can deal with Sheik's SH aerials in neutral by tapping shield whenever she jumps, and then walking a bit if needed and then punishing with a grab or DB. This forces her to go in the air less in neutral, forces her to use ground movement options to get away if you pressure her (like roll, which is easily covered by DB), and makes her have to try to punish your shields with empty hop grabs (which are good if unexpected, but not a reliable way to punish shield because all you have to do is react fast enough and grab her first, or even jab -> fsmash).  The vs Sheik matchup is pretty hard and would take some practice and some technical mastery of marth, but its not bad and, in consideration of different stages, should be a better pick than Palutena sometimes.  For reference, watch Ally against Mr R at EVO 2015. If you want to see more of Ally's marth, there are VODs of him playing mid-high level Sheiks in Michigan on GooshiGaming's youtube channel. Also, Nairo considers Lucina a decent counterpick against Sheik and you can see him using it against Dabuz's Sheik at CEO, although it wasn't a very close game.  Hope this was helpful! :)"

CrazyHand,3e0pfp,mewkazamgar,5,Tue Jul 21 01:40:36 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go on a limb and say Charizard. A lot of super armor special moves gives opponents few options to recover. His Nair off stage can screw over people's air dodge if they don't time it correctly, and a dair can easily kill. However, if the dair whiffs, then you can follow up with fair and guarantee the kill. Up -B can prevent an offensive recovery from the opponent as well."

CrazyHand,3e0pfp,leonprimrose,5,Tue Jul 21 02:55:40 2015 UTC,Meta Knight without a doubt. Five jumps in the air and all specials are recovery moves. Don't forget his amazing gimp game with his aerials. Be afraid to go offstage against a Meta Knight that knows what he's doing.

CrazyHand,3e0pfp,cbb692,2,Tue Jul 21 02:23:04 2015 UTC,"Friend plays villager and has great edge guard and off stage. Fair knock backs with him are ridiculous making recovery for ANY character next to impossible.   He'll also drop bowling balls continuously making it very difficult to recover from directly below the stage. And occasionally will plant, water, and chop down a tree right off the edge creating a MASSIVE hitbox going off stage.   Dair can spike and Uair with 3 turnips does lots of damage, too."
CrazyHand,3e0pfp,thesk8rguitarist,2,Tue Jul 21 05:27:12 2015 UTC,"Hi.  I'm late and Sheik, Pikachu and Villager have all been mentioned but no-one mentioned G&W. I'm a G&W main so I'm clearly biased so take this how you like.  Up-B and dair give amazing vertical coverage, fair is a kill move at higher percents and has a lasting hitbox and bair has a ton of priority and has a lasting hitbox, beating out a lot of side-b's (ex. fox's side-b) while also making it harder for regular players to tech a bair towards the stage.  Up B is amazing and can (and will) stage spike. You can also launch people with the trampoline if you miss to make them do an unsafe freefall landing back on stage.  I've never used bacon but I think it has it's uses and is something I need to learn. The frying pan from the bacon sends people at a very low angle if you can hit it properly and might have its uses as well (never tried this either yet).  D-tilt is a good setup into edgeguard situations with it's low launch angle.  Basically, G&W has dumb offstage coverage overall. G&W is not the greatest character you can main, but is unique enough to justify playing if you love to edge guard.  EDIT: Also bair and fair have disjoint hitboxes so if you're a noob like me and haven't gotten the habit to tech consistently yet, you can hold off learning a bit longer."

CrazyHand,3e0471,HappyZombies,18,Mon Jul 20 22:49:05 2015 UTC,"You want my (Melee player who follows the scene but doesn't play Smash4 competitively. ) opinion?   Pick a new main. Mega man is an alright character, but he just doesn't have the tools to be an amazing character. Yoshi has those tools. Yoshi is in every way a better character IMO. His attacks hit hard and he has great combos. It took me around 5 months to find my main in melee (fox). I maimed diddy in brawl so that's who I stuck with in smash4. Turned out pretty good lol.   You basically are faced with what I like to loosely call an Armada (Peach main melee) situation.   You can either stick with Mega man and try and perfect your play style with him. This will require hours upon hours in the lab (practice mode or unlimited time with a friend) to practice and see what works.   Or you can do what Armada did and find a new main who is better suited all around, and keep mega man on the back burner.   But remember through all of this. Have fun man. If you enjoy Mega Man, own that stuff. But if you like winning even more, than I'd highly recommend finding a new main.   -A Pete who likes to Party."
CrazyHand,3e0471,PARTY-PETE,2,Mon Jul 20 23:00:31 2015 UTC,"Y'know, this is really the best advice someone can give you, because it applies to competitive gaming in general, not just Smash 4.  Any competitive game has a metagame attached to it, in which matchups are analyzed, certain characters/champions/players/whatever are deemed more effective than others, and ""tiers"" are established to easily identify the best-in-class out of the available chess pieces that can be moved around.  I love Mega Man to death.  I grew up with his games, spent a lot of my formative years on message boards dedicated to the guy, even own Mega-themed articles of clothing I would never wear in public because of how fanboy-ish they look.  I'd be lying if I said I didn't buy SSB4 exclusively to play as the Blue Bomber.  But he doesn't fit the current metagame at all, simply because the mechanics of Smash 4 currently allow another character (namely Rosaluma) to do everything that he can do, but better.  This is a great example of how asking the question ""but why?"" can be useful when analyzing your decisions.  /u/PARTY-PETE is right in saying that you could spend hundreds of hours in the lab trying to figure out how to properly combat Sheik, ZSS, Yoshi, Luigi, Mario, Diddy, etc.  But why would you, when you can spend less than half of the time learning Rosalina & Luma and immediately get over the mechanical disadvantage that Megaman suffers against all of the aforementioned characters?  It doesn't make sense in terms of winning.    To prove my point:  here's a video of Scatt playing Megaman vs. Ally playing Mario at Smash 'n' Splash.  Do you see how easily Scatt is shut down by a character who simply fits the meta better than Megaman?  The only way that he can even keep up is by swapping to Ganon, and the Dorf has his own set of issues on which Ally capitalized to dominate the set.  This is not a lack of mechanical skill on Scatt's part (he 2-0'd M2K's Rosaluma in winner's finals for chrissakes); it's just that Megaman doesn't fit the current meta.  End of story.  Tiers exist for a reason in competitive play.  So then there's the the final complicating factor:  fun.  What are your goals?  Is it fun for you to just ""git gud"" and become an indestructible smash monster who cannot be beaten in tournament play?  Then you need to adapt to the meta and learn a new main.  Or, like me, is it only fun for you to win with characters that you enjoy playing?  If that's your goal, then just work on your Mega skills, but accept the fact that you are incurring a competitive disadvantage at the character select screen by choosing your favorite character.  As always, only you as the player can determine where you want to go with competitive smash.  Shoutouts to super fighting robots across the world, though.  Maybe one day based Sakurai will buff Mega to his crazy pre-release state and we can all finally blink our tired eyes as we ascend to S-Tier.Sakurai Plz"

CrazyHand,3e0471,awfulmemory,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:48:26 2015 UTC,"When I play Mega Man, I use tons of Metal Blades. throw them down to the ground and pick them up for a faster throw or z drop shenanigans. Throw them at angles to cover your landing or stop aerial approaches, or even lead into combos. Learn to use lemons more effectively; the aerial ones are the best imo because you can hop around and shoot them.  Luigi has a better time with Yoshi, but you need to use your strong mid range game with projectiles and punish approaches with your tilts and throws. Mega Man has decent ways to react up close. Up tilt can punish hits on your shield and can kill at low-ish percents. Down tilt and dash attack advance on the enemy for punishing and gaining stage control at the same time.  My tips to you would be to play more defensively and shoot stuff more efficiently. Mega Man can keep people at bay and force approaches with his lemons, Blades, Bombers, etc. You seemed to play impatiently and were rushing your opponent down; try not to do that so much. Know your options for up close as well. Fending off rushdown can be hard as Mega Man, since his CQC is a bit limited, but he has what he needs.  Keep at it. It's nice to know what character you want to play, and there's plenty to work on. You could also try to learn other characters if you get bored or frustrated and want to switch off of your main.

CrazyHand,3e0471,Electrical_Beast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:54:57 2015 UTC,"you have good setups, but try to look more at your foe´s character; on the second video, your first death could´ve been avoided with an air dodge. Taking that as an example take in count that yoshi players like to do that attack a lot to do the meteor smash thing; so next time predict the same and dodge when he gets close. It wasnt a rape, just try to see more how you character moves before you do,  wait for him to attack, shield or dodge and counter attack him with his pants down (wait, yoshi doesnt have pants). You are good just dont be reckless and focus on what is doing your opponent, predict him (not guess). And dont use the lemons so often, they arent so good. Dont use the forward smash so reckless, as it has too much cool down (its better for edgeguarding or save it to take the stock). The down tilt is bvery useful, is like a roll with an attack instead of dodging. Practice with Luigi, if you like it it can be good to have it as a pocket character. Play as Yoshi too, and learn its weaknesses, the exploit them back with megamanos."

When going up against characters with limited recoveries, just hang onto the ledge and respond to their recoveries with your aerials. For an example, let's say you've knocked a Fox offstage and you grab the ledge. Here's what you can do:  *Fox attempts to illusion to the ledge: let go of the ledge, jump, and nair. If done correctly, you should be nair'ing at the ledge, and you'll hit them before they grab the ledge.  *Fox attempts to illusion directly onto the stage: jump from the ledge and try to intercept him with a nair or bair, same as before.  *Fox tries to recover low with Fox Fire: Fox is dead. Let go of the ledge and bair him.  This also applies to other characters' recoveries too, such as Rosalina and even Shiek!"

CrazyHand,3dyrnv,djhw624,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:43:29 2015 UTC,"My extent of knowledge with Ryu is pretty damn limited, but here's my two cents:  I'm under the impression that Shakunetsu moves slower than the regular Hadouken, and it has a lasting hitbox that'll chip away at shields or catch people off guard if they don't keep their shield up for long enough. That being said, I think the slow speed makes it really fun to use in the air to stunt landings or recoveries.  Generally just use it to apply pressure, and I think if an opponent is being campy or overly defensive, hanging back and slinging a few of those will make them play a bit more in your favor. Truth be told though, when I play Ryu I almost never use his special moves aside from his killer up-special and his side-special as recovery, so Hadouken/Shakunetsu is a bit hazy to me."
CrazyHand,3dyrnv,Commander_Sloth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:47:20 2015 UTC,"I tend to use it as a mix-up from the normal or inputted hadouken. Since it moves at a different speed and has a slightly different effect, I think it can help to throw off the opponent in some cases. I use all of the hadouken forms similar to how Yoshi uses eggs, mainly as a spacing and pressure tool and as something that could lead to the opponent making a mistake I can punish.  Also as djhw624 said, it is also useful for a mix-up when landing, though I feel that focus attack is a bit better as you can dash cancel it and it will save you a hit.  If you have any other questions about Ryu, I can help to answer them. I've been playing him almost exclusively since release, so I feel confident about my knowledge."
CrazyHand,3dyrnv,Commander_Sloth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:26:03 2015 UTC,"I feel a good way to do it is by starting the input similar to dashing the opposite direction you're facing, but then quickly circling around the bottom half of the stick. I still sometimes mess up, but I get it much more often then not. The timing is a bit precise I've found, maybe just a few frames after inputting the backwards dash. It feels similar to a normal inputted hadouken, just a bit faster and more movement."

You charge to much, you need to fight any enemy on your terms that mallet is to fast to break through you can roll around him to attack his back side. When he charges you hit them and grab him throw'em  into the ground and have a curb party.  You hide in the shield a lot, Ness is a nimble fighter work on your agility   About the PK Fire it's not just for offense it can stop thrown objects and physical attacks, it's a slow attack can leave you open when fighting multiple opponents. Even the yoyo can stop those spikey guys, I am not sure if PK Fire can work against the spikes.  Juggle your enemies; pop King into the and keep him there throw him and chase him cause as much damage as you can.   Use your home run bat.  Your TK bolt can be use continuously when deedee is off the map hit him with the tail of the bolt over and over. Never use the head of the bolt.  Whew💨 hope that helps."
CrazyHand,3dzwum,Gunslinger_11,2,Mon Jul 20 22:20:46 2015 UTC,"To start, I think you really need to tighten up your PK Fire usage. I really don't agree with how much you use it in the air, as it's very situational, it leaves you very open, and it doesn't trap an opponent as much as a grounded PK Fire does.   Your opponents were able to roll around your PK Fire many times, meaning your usage of it got predictable. Try to mix up when you use it; it's a very good tool for catching rolls. Also, when someone gets caught in PK Fire, don't just automatically go in for a grab. Experienced players will be able to escape it quickly. The three main options an opponent has when stuck in PK Fire are shield, jump, and roll back. If they shield, go for the grab. If they jump, try to get them with an aerial or chase them with a PK Thunder. If they roll back, run forward and get the grab or catch them with another PK Fire and start the guessing game over again. Basically, PK Fire is more than just a confirm for your grab, and very often doesn't even do as much as that.   As for Dedede specific things, you need to start challenging his Gordos with your PK Thunder. If you see a Dedede using Gordos as soon as he gets far away from you, try throwing a PK Thunder at him. Even if you don't hit Dedede, you can safely nullify the Gordo and make Dedede think twice about when to use it. Also, try to use PK Thunder to chase Dedede offstage, especially since he doesn't have a lot of aerial mobility.   If you're feeling bold, and you see that Dedede isn't shielding when caught in a PK Fire, try stepping forward and shoot another one right into the center of his hitbox. Since Dedede is so big, this is usually pretty easy if your opponent doesn't do much to escape. This is an example of what I mean. It's some serious cheese, but worth going for since it can rack up some serious damage."
CrazyHand,3dzwum,LIEF64,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:58:30 2015 UTC,I like your use of pk Fire.
CrazyHand,3dzwum,Gunslinger_11,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:19:57 2015 UTC,"As a Ness main I struggle with DDD too, the trick is to simply not charge him as much, I play aggressive too but against heavier opponents I switch it up a bit. They have big hit boxes and hard hitting moves.  A couple of things you did wrong that I noticed.   Calm down, you're going insane try hard mode and keep getting hit by the Gordo's because you're always mid attack because you never stop attacking. Gordo's are easily hit by a Nair and can be really frustrating for DDD since it will hit him back way easier. So he will have to shield or dodge or hit it back. PK Fire from top is a good approach but not too much since DDD has decent range, you might wanna switch It up in between. The triple /double Fair needs to stop or at least look what you're doing. It's a very cliche move and people know about the string, the only reason to combo into so many Fairs is to push them far off stage which in this case won't help you much since he can float. You're better off switching to Fair-Nair-Uair and I usually even throw in a fast PK2 in there which gets a bonus 8 damage. He's a big target it's easy to hit as long as you're in control of the PK2 Personally I have no shame in spamming PK Fire. But by spamming I mean comboing them not just keep spamming it until one hits, if you hit him with a PK Fire in the air he's momentarily trapped you can follow up with another PK Fire on the floor and another ,  if he floats away like he should, retreat until he comes back to the ground."
CrazyHand,3dxf6l,EonXII,3,Mon Jul 20 09:33:15 2015 UTC,"Pikachu main here.  Edgeguarding with pika is a little hard to get down, but once you get it, its amazing.    First thing when you get someone offstage is pressure by spamming tjolts.  That'll guide them to commit to recovering either high or low.  You really want them to recover low, as that is when you can use your amazing aerials.  If they recover low, drop down and either bair or fair, and once they get caught in it, fast fall.  The may pika's hitboxes work is that they drag an opponent with them, so if you fall down to the blast zone, they will too. It might seem like you're about to die, but if you conserved your jump and know how to use quick attack correctly, you will get back onstage fine while their up-b is futile.    If they recover high, the best thing I've learned is to either jump at them, wait for the airdodge, and fair, or go under them and thunder.  The thunder is more preferred but is not as consistent as just fairing them.  What do you do now to edgeguard?"
CrazyHand,3dxf6l,Sir_Upvote,2,Mon Jul 20 15:41:17 2015 UTC,"I really like the point about thunder jolts forcing opponents to commit to a certain option, which is certainly an example of high level play. In high level play of any sport or game, your opponents will make no mistakes unless you cut off their options and put them in a situation to make a mistake, which you can take advantage of.  That being said, thunder jolt to opponent air dodges to bair/fair to fast fall is a common tactic of mine. Also, back air can send the opponent into the stage for a stage spike, an easy kill if your opponent doesn't tech the stage."
CrazyHand,3dxf6l,ExtremeMagneticPower,2,Mon Jul 20 21:55:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  And yeah I agree bair is amazing offstage.  Because of the multiple hits, it's unexpected as to when the moves gonna send you flying into the stage.  Makes teching really hard even if you're a pika main and know his moves like the back of your hand :/."
CrazyHand,3dxf6l,Sir_Upvote,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:06:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Usually I try to chase them far offstage for fairs (like Melee Jigglypuff, but they are usually able to avoid me and sometimes return to the stage before me) or b reversed thunder (but that usually knocks them upwards towards me instead of away). I'll also shield at the ledge and try to read their getup but that doesn't work too well in the presence of lag.  Stupid question, but how do I run off the stage? Jumping off usually slows me down and feels awkward, and dashing towards the ledge results in Pikachu auto grabbing it and throws me off. Any way to avoid that?"
CrazyHand,3dxf6l,Sir_Upvote,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:22:24 2015 UTC,"Just dash towards the edge and keep holding the run button until you're far enough away from the edge.  That should keep you from autosnapping. If that doesn't work, you could always just jump off the ledge instead of falling off.  The dangerous thing about that is that you might accidentally use your double jump and end up killing yourself.  And this is just a random tip.  If you don't go for an edgeguard, I found a VERY effective mixup is fsmashing out of range when they are about to get up.  They'll generally try to rush in with the punish, but you can just fsmash again while they're running after you.  Quick easy kill since you're at the ledge already, or sets up another edgeguarding situation."
CrazyHand,3dxf6l,Riah8426,2,Mon Jul 20 23:39:50 2015 UTC,"I'm actually trying to teach my brother this, as he is a learning Pika main.  Off stage Fair is very disruptive, as well as Nair or Bair for stage spiking. For Bair, pikachu launches the opponent the opposite direction Pikachu is facing (ex: facing left will knock them right, etc.).  Pikachu's thunder is also good for spiking, but you really have to position yourself to hit with the cloud, and know how to recover afterwards. Immediately using thunder after a jump will give you a slightly higher jump if it connects with pikachu to help."
CrazyHand,3dxf6l,link3988,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:36:19 2015 UTC,You usually NEED to jump before doing the thunder off stage. If you have any horizontal momentum and don't jump you will SD as thunder misses pika.

CrazyHand,3dxf6l,TowelstheTricker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:28:56 2015 UTC,"Mixing up your moves will keep your opponent guessing which aerial you will use, and throw them off.  Highly reccomend seeing Pon's For Glory vs a Pikachu (starts at 5:00) for an idea of how the Pikachu edgeguards as a means of mixups.  https://youtu.be/IvU5RQ-nJog  Edit: The most notable Off stage play starts at 7:17, but the whole match is a good Idea to see some good Pika play."
CrazyHand,3dxf6l,TalkingFrenchFry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:48:47 2015 UTC,"It can be a good habit to get into when going for the cloud offstage, to end your forward momentum after a jump. That way your bolt will hit you and cause you to jump back up a bit.   It slightly ruins cloud spikes tho."
CrazyHand,3dxf6l,TalkingFrenchFry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:31:43 2015 UTC,"ledge trumping is a great way to start edge guarding.  Also, Nair and fairs are great for pushing the opponent away.  don't be afraid to go deep with pikachu since he has one of the best recovery in the game.  my personal favorite edge guarding is to catch them in a falling back air and then they get spiked off the stage into a footstool."

CrazyHand,3dxf6l,Sir_Upvote,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:27:01 2015 UTC,He has a few options.  Neutral air can usually knock the opponent away from the ledge and then you can hop back on the ledge and drop down with a fair.  A back air can work of they jump after being trumped (which they usually do).  Experiment and see what works for you.

I can play some noob on FG that cant handle basic fundamentals, but they seem to be able to read my shielding habits and punish acordingly.

CrazyHand,3dwo9w,TheTaoDragon,2,Mon Jul 20 03:54:12 2015 UTC,"Learn how to properly DI in terms of combos and survival. Sheik doesn't have the best knockback on her moves and relies on her great edge guarding kit to secure kills. Be wary of Sheik whenever you are above her on a platform, her up smash will auto sweet spot and kill you at 90~100% if you aren't careful. Try to learn your opponent's habits, Sheik is the best character in the game for a reason, so while it may be hard to exploit technical aspects, exploiting habits will a really good skill for anyone to pick up on. Most of the time you want to jump out of Sheik's down throw at kill percents because it becomes an air-dodge 50/50 and you can't always guess right. To wrap it up, stay unpredictable, because a good Sheik player will exploit habits and with a top tier closing out stocks isn't hard at all.   If you need any clarification feel free to ask."
CrazyHand,3dwo9w,SkyLightDance,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:53:15 2015 UTC,"Sheik main here, this is all very valid advice. The only thing i would add is to be wary when edge guarding a sheik. The invincibility frames on the vanish mean that sheik could purposely time it out and hit you with it while you're trying to edge guard and get an early kill.   If your asking which characters best counter sheik, in my opinion Sheik, Yoshi,Diddy and Rosa are all not bad options. But sheik still probably wins all those matchups (minus sheik-sheik)."

I threw a loud ""SHORYUKEN"", which did nothing, but I jumped up after I landed and started juggling Shiek off the stage. They tried to teleport but then I used dair. My first meteor smash to the bottom blast line right as ""1"" showed up on the screen. Never have I ever been able to fight in the air like that. They disconnected after that fight. I had to be rushed to the hospital, because it seemed that I had a rush of adrenaline that caused a mini-stroke. I guess that's why the replay is faster than I remember it.

CrazyHand,3dwo9w,Xentrik,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:29:03 2015 UTC,"So I was standing in a rather large line at my local Wal-Mart today behind a couple families that I know from when I went to church with my family in year younger. It was the only register open so there wasn't much of another option to get my 12 pack of Mountain Dew for a party I was heading to. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a little old lady who didn't have enough for her groceries and she was trying to talk the cashier into letting her get away with being short. This struck me as odd until I found out she was a mere $0.21 short of her purchase. Now all these families were just staring and there was even two making fun of her. I walked up and handed my soda to the cashier, handed him a $5 and told her to keep the change. One of the middle aged women (I knew these people, so I also knew that they all make over 6 digits) grabbed her kid and yelled very loudly, ""See that man? He's acting just like Jesus wants us to."" For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I haven't shaved in awhile so I'm rocking some nice scruff, a Slayer shirt, and gym shorts, so it must have been a nice sight. Very loudly, I said ""Like Jesus? Ma'am I'm an atheist who makes minimum wage and I was the one who stepped up to help her? Your hypocritical Christianity is an inspiration to us all."" As I stormed out, a couple of the cart boys started to whistle and cheer, soon shoppers joined in and even the cashier. I gave a wave and went off with a feeling of accomplishment."

In general your strategy should be to float around someone until you have an opening then start a fair/Nair combo. Dash attack can also combo into itself.  Get to know what % is needed for rest to kill various characters (usually about 70). Finally, be smart with your rests, don't throw a risky one out if they can KO you with a charged smash. Your safe resting % varies depending on who you are playing but I would say if you're under 50-60 it's usually safe (except DDD whose charged F smash can kill puff in the 30s).  I consider myself a fairly skilled puff player, let me know if you want some practice  on Wii u or 3ds.  Edit: Couple other thoughts. Roll out is useful as a surprise attack at high %s (100+) and also usually beats people on sudden death. People will catch on if you use it more than a couple times. Don't use it at low %s because the knock back is low and they will have a free hit on you after. Smashes are pretty weak and take a long time, fsmash is probably the best. Tilts and jab on the other hand come out quick and are pretty useful."

CrazyHand,3dv3r0,JBrooks_KTD,2,Mon Jul 20 00:48:11 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say super good, it's like anything else, if you do it too much you'll get read and punished into next week. It's a way to approach, you also could mix that with Dash Atk, BAir, DAir, and NAir too. Obviously you need to dash dance, with wavedashes mixed in, before doing any of those."

CrazyHand,3dvqpr,Keencrunch,2,Sun Jul 19 22:53:58 2015 UTC,"My God, that poor Pit player. Getting sweet spotted with side-b is soul crushing!  Seriously though, you've got some substantial techniques. To me, you seem like a player who knows exactly how to use bonus fruit. Your key pick-up offstage Vs. Falcon was something I almost never see. Brand new combinations with bonus fruit, hydrant, and z dropping should happen almost every match, and that's exactly what you're doing. I'm impressed.  In terms of criticism, Samus was giving you a hard time in the beginning. When I use Pac-Man against another brick waller, the hydrant is my highest priority. Because Samus doesn't have fast aerial mobility, the hydrant forces her in the air where her movement is more predictable, or pushes her off the edge. In both situations, her neutral and side specials aren't favorable options since she will be a sitting duck while being forcibly moved.   In other words, try complementing avoidance strategies with the hydrant. It's potential is far greater when used as defense."
CrazyHand,3duec7,Un0va,6,Sun Jul 19 15:59:21 2015 UTC,"There's a few things that matter. First, overall size. Certain characters like room to run around, others like to get right up in your face. Second, platforms. Platforms can allow for combo continuity or interruption, depending on the matchup. They also prevent projectile camping, which is why few characters will take fox or falco to fd (an exception being marth, for combo reasons). Platform placement is also important. Yoshis has low platforms, so marth can cover an entire platform without leaving the ground, allowing safe tech chases. Dreamland's are too high, so it's easier to escape marth combos. Third, you touched on it, blast zones. Floaties generally like big blast zones with high ceiling, since they can recover from almost anywhere, and usually die off the top. Fox likes low ceilings, since his KOs usually come off the top. Samus loves FoD because she can recover from anywhere and it's blast zones are HUGE. There's a few other things, like yoshi's walls for wall jumping (falcons love this) and FoD's moving platforms (it seems to be personal preference, but it can matter), but these are less important overall."
CrazyHand,3duec7,holographicmew,5,Sun Jul 19 16:31:02 2015 UTC,"Oh, and your second question. You can counter pick to any neutral stage as well as PS. The exception is DSR, which (in it's usual implementation) prevents you from picking a stage you've already won on. So let's say I win game one on FD. You can counterpick to any stage you want, including stadium and FD. You go to yoshi's and win. Now it's my counterpick, and I can go anywhere except FD, since I've already won there. This is how it's usually done in Bo5, though I think it's more stringent in Bo3."

CrazyHand,3dti3s,watermelonpickle,2,Sun Jul 19 08:28:26 2015 UTC,"Auto pilot for most people is doing the same thing over and over without realizing it, and is easily punished. Just make sure when you go into what you call ""auto pilot"",  you make a conscious effort to pay attention to that. Don't do the same moves and approaches over and over, mix things up. Periodically remind yourself. Watch replays of things you did wrong during auto pilot, and actively tell yourself to do or not do those things while playing the next time.   And obviously pay attention to the moves and approaches they make. Many people have habits and aren't even thinking of conditioning, so don't think they're trying to condition you (until proven otherwise). Don't over think, just react. Mind games will come about naturally later."
CrazyHand,3dti3s,sevenmd,2,Sun Jul 19 13:22:58 2015 UTC,"It could be as simple as recognising something bad or repetitive that you do while auto-piloting and making a conscious effort to not do it and change it up. I've found that that helps to take me out of auto-mode without making me overthink and freeze up, and you can gradually add more little mini-tactics until you're thinking about three or four little things on the fly without taking on the mammoth task of thinking about everything and anything -- just a few specific things you're working on right here, right now.   Hopefully those mini-tactics become bread and butter soon enough and you can tackle something else next session.  It personally works for me, one I was doing earlier was not thinking and constantly dash attacking my opponenent into space at high percents when I could have been Up-smashing them for a kill about ten dashes ago."
CrazyHand,3dti3s,Huff_Paint,2,Sun Jul 19 13:54:49 2015 UTC,"It is a lot easier to stay away from auto-piloting than it is to not overthink. Most of the time, if you are thinking, then you are not auto-piloting (thinking about the game, of course). To prevent overthinking, focus on only the neutral game when you are in the neutral, focus on only edgegraurding while edgeguarding, focus on only recovering while recovering, and so on. Soon, what is considered that sweet spot between auto-piloting and overthinking will become auto-piloting and at that point you can move on to the next level. Perhaps your charactors' ATs or maybe getting a read on the opponent. Start while simple stuff and move on to the more complicated things. I suggest focusing solely on fundementals (zoning, stage control, timing, spacing, etc) then moving on to slightly more complicated stuff like DI, punishes, and mix ups. Just keep going higher and higher. Eventually, all you will be thinking of is your opponent. This is why i main jiggs. I didnt chose her because she is good, i chose her because she sucks in sm4sh (Sakurai, why you do dis). She forces me to play smart because thats the only way i can take out characters like luigi, sheik, and zss who completly out class her. Now, i can space my attacks almost perfectly, gain stage control, and mix up my approaches without thinking. Just take it slow and work your way up."

CrazyHand,3dtkec,Xentrik,5,Sun Jul 19 09:09:49 2015 UTC,Wii controllers don't have input lag. Use whatever you want mate. I'm a proponent for GameCube but a lot of people like the Pro.
CrazyHand,3dtkec,obsidianchao,2,Sun Jul 19 12:38:38 2015 UTC,"The pro controller would probably be easier to get used to since its button layout is pretty similar to 3ds, with the ABXY and there isn't a random z button with no equivalent on the other side. When I tried to switch from 3ds to gamecube I was making input errors all the time, but you can get used to it. Another note is that gcc needs an adapter which is hard to get, but it's also the preferred one for tournaments since it's wired."
CrazyHand,3dtkec,abir51,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:24:22 2015 UTC,"I have the same dilemma. I thought of getting the Pro controller, but if it has input lag I'm not sure (does it...?). Getting a GC controller means getting an adapter as well which is both costly and difficult to find (i think).   Also the pro controller works for more games than the GC controller works for, so long term maybe the pro is better? I also need some advice so I'll check the replies on this thread."
CrazyHand,3dtkec,Sadaxer,3,Sun Jul 19 10:48:53 2015 UTC,"Pro controller has no lag. Of course it has some more drawbacks than the GC controller. Some of the drawbacks are if your playing in a tournament you have to disconnect the controller after playing to prevent you from interfering the match that is played after.I don't know for sure about this one but, this may happen if you go to a really big tournament such as a national.I would only use GC if I had spare gamecube controllers from melee because that that would mean buying an adapter and a pro controller seems like a better option at that point due to it getting expensive . One last thing, the GC controller has a different layout and wasn't made for Smash so it's features like half presses on the L and R buttons not doing anything. This is the one thing that made me switch because techs in something like PM would register but I would always miss them in 4 so I just started to use pro and now I know that I like that show. Pretty sure adapters are in stock now because I see them in stores all the time."
CrazyHand,3dtkec,Lacabuus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:45:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this info! I'm glad there's no lag with the pro controller. The disconnecting is fine for me, don't think it'll be a big problem. Doubt I'll go to that big tournaments. Think it's not worth it for me then, the pro seems to do everything really well. Yeah I tried a GC controller a few weeks ago, last time being yeeeeears. It felt so weird and wrong, especially the L/R buttons. Yeah the adapters probably exist but I think getting the Pro will be best for me. Thanks for the detailed comment, much appreciated!"
CrazyHand,3dtkec,Sadaxer,2,Sun Jul 19 12:54:07 2015 UTC,Don't even worry about the disconnecting. It's the same thing as unplugging a controller.

CrazyHand,3dtkec,BlankTrack,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:32:22 2015 UTC,"Although i have not tested it, i have heard that it is harder to do perfect pivots on the pro-controller; or rather, it is easier to do it on the gamecube controller. The size and placement of the buttons makes it a lot easier to do short hops, especially short hops into nair. The most distinct advantage the pro-controller has over the GC controller is that it has an extra button next to L. This could help you input things faster by setting L to shield, R to jump, ZR to specials, and ZL to attack, or some variation of that. This would allow you to always keep your fingers on the same buttons, with your thumbs on the joysticks (to grab, just hit L and ZL at the same time. Theyre next to each other, it should be easy.) One other thing is that tou need an adapter for the gc controller where you dont for the pro-controller. This could make the pro-controller a less expensive choice. I recommend the gamecube controller. I like the way the buttons are positioned and it feels more natural to me. It also allows me to play older games because it is backwards compatible where the pro-contoller is not. I can also use my adapter on my computor via downloadable driver. Ultimately it is up to you, though."

If you find your hands getting even slightly sweaty while playing, I'd go with something with more of a matte finish. The hori pads I've been using are good for this, as well as the biogenik pro controllers, if you find that the pro controller suits you better. As for preference though, the gamecube style controller just seems to work better as the button placement is more suited to smash."

CrazyHand,3dtkec,TBoneD2000,0,Sun Jul 19 09:47:59 2015 UTC,I highly recommend the GC controller just because it is a fantastic controller and it is pretty much the only controller used in tournament.
CrazyHand,3dt9ip,cowswillrule,3,Sun Jul 19 06:08:11 2015 UTC,"Just pirate an ISO, test it, and burn it to a blank GC disk. Better yet, find a friend who already has a copy, rip theirs using a homebrewed wii with cleanrip, and burn it to a blank GC disk. This practice is frowned upon, but who fucking cares. At least this way, you don't need to worry about the disk being scratched or worn down before or soon after you buy it."

If you don't mind the wii's lack of authenticity though, just get an ISO and Nintendont on an SD card."

No, I don't think you can do that. You can buy mini dvd-r's and burn a game's image to them using a certain program. Then, in order for the GC to actually play the disk, you need to install a modchip to the mobo. It's not really a complicated process, but there's a lot of preparations that need to be done beforehand.  Again, I'd advise just playing backups on a wii."
CrazyHand,3dt9ip,SuperMikey64,2,Sun Jul 19 19:40:54 2015 UTC,If you have a half decent computer you can download dolphin and the melee ISO and play on your computer. If your computer runs it good enough you can buy an adapter and GameCube controller. And you can play netplay and stuff.

CrazyHand,3du752,GreatGateway,2,Sun Jul 19 14:47:06 2015 UTC,"Find a secondary.  In all seriousness, stage pick is pretty important in this case. Abuse platforms, force approaches with Thunder, and try your best to rack up damage while learning how they move. Stay away from the very edge of the stage to avoid gimps, since Sheik will have a harder time killing you otherwise. Once she's at around 110% or higher, Wind Jab is VERY effective and consistent as a kill move, at least from my experience. Though godlike DI might make a difference, haven't been able to test that. Don't bother with grabs or throws, it means a definite punish if whiffed for not much in return, high risk low reward, especially considering her moves have too little ending lag to even shield grab punish well. Practice the timing of Levin aerials vs. Bouncing Fish."
CrazyHand,3du752,UnusualGibus,2,Sun Jul 19 15:55:00 2015 UTC,"Robin vs Sheik is a MU that isn't nearly as bad as I first thought. While it will depend on what type of player you go against (Needle camp versus Fair rushdown), Robin has the tools to take them on.  Don't be afraid to get in the air. As good as Sheik's Fair is, a well-placed Nair has the disjoints to beat out many of her aerials. Depnding on how you've conditioned them, or how they react to your approach in general, you may want to read a roll with an Arcfire or punish a Sheild with an empty hop > Grab or a Nosferatu. If they just toss out needles when you do, do NOT be afraid to take the trade. Needles are a pain in the ass, but if you have to take a needle to land an Arcfire, do it.  Robin has what Sheik does not: Kill power. If they mindlessly dash grab or attack, you can punish her with either a roll>Wind jab, or maybe just jabbing in general. Punish panic rolls with Thunder or Elthunder, and Needle camping with a close Arcthunder (May have to trade; Worth it.) Uair is amazing as always, and Fair ain't to shabby. Don't be afraid to use Bair, as if they aren't expecting it, you can get a kill with it. Dair is much riskier, but if a Sheik runs off stage without thinking, it can net you the kill.  Generally speaking, you'll want stages with platforms. Battlefield and Dreamland are the best in this regard, but even Smashville and whatnot are fine. Flat stages such as FD, Omega, and kind of Smashville are okay, but more prone to needle camping than the others. Learn to mix up movement using B-reverses, and platform escape options/punishment through Isai drops, assuming you can't Shield drop (I can Isai drop > Uair, but only if it's an Isai drop).  Always think. If you think they're going to move one way, punish it. Look for patterns and obvious choices. I punished a Diddy who used Monkey Flip in the air for the kill because I saw him doing it a lot. Likewise, if they always Bouncing Fish when you Arcfire, bait it out and punish accordingly, or do a retreating Fair (I think this works. Need to test it.) Grabs are okay, but only as a punish/read and a GTFO option. You probably won't kill with them unless you're on the edge and they're at 140 and you use back-throw.  As for WFT, I have nothing, unfortunately. Abuse the wonky hitboxes and B-reverses. Not much else I can say."
CrazyHand,3du752,SilentExorcist,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:31:56 2015 UTC,"One of Robins combos also uses his Up Smash as a shield. You can keep that up as long as you like, just make sure you have the book to do so. It will repel Shiek's explosive, catch a Bouncing Fish, and eat up needles. Shiek won't even be able to come in. You can punish after this, or, wait until after sudden death and use what Shiek lacks. Kill power."
CrazyHand,3dtay9,theycallmebraniac,2,Sun Jul 19 06:29:28 2015 UTC,"(Sorry in advance for the wall of text, I sort of just got going and never stopped. Cheers)  imho, Pika owns a lot of matchups in this game for having great speed, approach options in the neutral, and combo potential. Pika is very good at juggling from below, and Ness does not have a fast enough dair to combat it. Lucas on the other hand, has a slight advantage here due to his multihit dair. For Ness, it's all about setting up with the bread and butter: pk fire dthrow fair fair nair etc.. getting it set up can be tough because pika is very quick. It's important not to get grabbed, so tried to utilize shff, mixed up with retreating nairs/fairs. Once they're at a high percent, try to fish for a ground approach and get that back throw. They'll know you want it, so if you feel like you're going to get punished for trying, mix it up with reverse aerial bairs or pivot grabs to safely get that kill. Upair is also a great option if you can get below pika. When you can, try to recover health from pikas thunderjolts with pk magnet, but this could be a set up for a punish if they know you're going to do it. Really only use it from far away. (Also, I've heard NAKAT say on his stream that you can jump cancel your pk magnet, but I have no idea how that works and I can't seem to find a tutorial).  When offstage, you have to be really careful of how you recover. Pika loses to get gimp kills with thunderjolts and aerials, and Ness has limited recovery options due to his pk thunder. if you can, tease them off the edge a bit and try to get them looking for a gimp so you can wreck them with pk thunder. Or, pk thunder above parallel with the ledge so they go low and miss you.  Hope this sort of makes sense. Like sevenmd said, this would be easier with a vid of some sort but I'll keep trying :)  Lucas is a bit different. You lose backthrow as a kill, and you lose pk fire as a trap. Even worse, you lose your bnb fair strings and your combo potential in general. Luckily, you gain grab length, a nair that can combo, and a tether to mix up recoveries (and a much less gimpable pk thunder). in general you gain some great spacing tools to keep opponents at bay. Pika is really tough though, being faster and having more options. a lot of the same rules for Ness apply for Lucas: don't get grabbed, down pk magnet for punish, and don't be predictable. But with the pika matchup with lucas, you lose a major kill option with bair, because pika is very hard to gimp with a fast and unpredictable recovery. that said, you can still read rolls and techs for safe reverse bair approaches, and use short hop pk fires to keep pika away. to kill, try to land a smash attack or get an upthrow (although pika can survive at very high percents, so be cautious of that).  All in all this is not an easy match up by any means, but focus on your character's strengths and your opponents weaknessess, with enough practice you'll hold up a fight."

CrazyHand,3du0pr,HavenZ,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:33:35 2015 UTC,With falco  Up throw into neutral air connects very often at low precent  Off stage forward air is deadly  Up air has change so that it is better for juggling opponents  Forward smash is his best smash

CrazyHand,3du0pr,-Take-Five-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:07:56 2015 UTC,Commenting so I can read this later
CrazyHand,3du0pr,OneShotZero,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:20:54 2015 UTC,"Falco's a spacing character with limited approach options in this game. He doesn't have lagless double short hop laser, so your neutral is hurt, but lazier is still good at forcing approaches (mind your end lag when you do this) and to some extents, a combo/string extender.  All of Falco's tilts are very strong, too. DTilt can lead into aerials rather easily and can lead into grab at bottom percentages. FTilt starts and ends quickly, hag great rage for a tilt and does solid damage. UTilt leads into itself at bottom percentages and pretty much all aerials save DAir at middling percentages. Use this to lead into a BAir, which will kill at 100-120%, depending on where you are.  Your throws are pretty cool too. DThrow leads into dash attack, USmash, FAir, all kinds of things, as long as your opponent is bottom-mid percents. UThrow leads into most aerials save DAir at low-lowmid, and can sometimes kill with either UAir (eats fast fallers up) and BAir.   For Aerials, FAir, NAir and UAir are all very viable combo moves- looking at a montage of Falco should give you a good idea of his aerial combo kit. DAir is a good edge guarding tool, because no matter which part hits, it will do well, because the sourspot hits sideways, which still doesn't help enemy recovery at all.  BAir can also be a combo move at lower percents, but it has a primary purpose as an excellent kill move. It comes out quickly, ends pretty quick too and kills at the aforementioned percentages.  Your reflector, other than reflecting, is a good spacing tool, it eats short hopped aerial approaches, especially if you short hop too. You can still maneuver when it's being used, so it can be viably used as an unorthodox edgeguarding tactic. On the ground, it can lead into valuable tech chases as well.  Your smashes all kill pretty well. DSmash comes out quick, but the end lag is pretty bad. Use it in panicky close-quarters situations as well as punishing rolls. FSmash kills nicely, but you have to be close to them to get a good killing strike. The distant hits are feeble and nearly never kill. It's dominating range does provide purpose against those recovering high, as it has a killing hotbox above you at the start. USmash is a two-hit move, so it can whiff on Jiggs and other super floaters, but it's pretty consistent usually. The killing hotbox goes a bit behind you, and you can trip up your enemies by using it accordingly.  Side B, when used instantly upon leaving the ground via jump, will have much less end lag. This allows you to approach with it and sometimes combo off of it, but it quickly becomes predictable, so you have to mix it up or face punishment.  I guess you could use UpB on stage, but it's generally a bad idea. You don't get that much reward and you're prone to being punished.   Your general game plan is to space the enemy out and don't approach too much. Use those tilts, and DTilt or DSmash if you and the enemy are too close. At high percents, try using any of your smashes to kill, depending on the positioning of the opponent. BAir is awesome for killing as well, and UThrow to UAir can kill sometimes too.   Good luck!"
CrazyHand,3dsume,SubtleTypos,5,Sun Jul 19 03:11:24 2015 UTC,"Your ROB was pretty solid against Mario, so I'll try to focus on the Toon Link match.   Against that Toon Link, I think you could of played more patiently against him. Toon Link may have his fancy projectiles, but in most cases, ROB can outspace Toon Link with Laser and Gyro. Of course, against an aggro Toon Link like that, it's definitely difficult, but doable. You would have to find ways to punish Toon Link's approaches and create space between yourself and him. ROB's tilts do an okay job at doing this, with Down Tilt being able to trip opponents and Forward Tilt being able to push opponents back.  As far as approaches go, you relied on Neutral Air a bit too much as an approach and that Toon Link eventually started to catch on to that by shielding and using Up Tilt. Honestly, ROB doesn't have the best approach options and fairs better at capitalizing on your opponents and finding holes in their defense. In a matchup like that, it probably would of been safer to stay on the ground as much as possible, as Toon Link can fill the air with projectiles and shut down any aerial approaches.  One of the big things I noticed in both matches is your habit to roll back after committing to an attack. I believe Toon Link only managed to grab you once for it, but he also managed to hit you with projectiles as a punish. In those situations, you can simply dash away or short hop backwards instead of rolling.  In general, you should get in more practice with aiming the Gyro when you send it out. There were quite a few situations where you tried to keep Toon Link at bay or edge guard with the Gyro, but it wound up flying over his head. The best kind of practice naturally comes from fighting more people and trying out different trajectory heights with the Gyro. Over time, you kinda just learn where it's gonna go. The same thing also applies to picking up the Gyro and throwing it.  Now, with all of that said, I'll end this critique with...a gift. Yeah, a gift. Here's a playlist of AceStarThe3rd's Undefeatable series with ROB. He's a Rosalina main with a pretty solid ROB, and his series is also pretty entertaining. I just made this playlist about a minute ago and, frankly, I have yet to finish the series myself, so it's a plus for me too. Alternatively, feel free to watch other ROB mains on Youtube like Chibo, Mister Eric, 8-Bit, Holy, Squeak, Uno, etc. ROB mains tend to have varying differences from each other in terms of how they play, so maybe try to find a style that suits you or, better yet, combine different styles and create your own. Hope this helps."
CrazyHand,3dsume,Crescentium,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:30:59 2015 UTC,"Beautiful, thanks so much for the thorough critique. I'll work on playing the patient/long game in situations like these, as well as focusing on exploiting holes in defense and mixing up post-attack commitment retreat options.   As for the gyro, with that having been said, would it be ideal not to charge it up in the start of the match/downtime/neutral to save for that gimp?  Also, thank you kindly for the AceStarThe3rd playlist; I'll be studying this thoroughly! Again, thanks so much. You've been incredibly helpful.  edit: Also, 8bitman is one of my favorite ROBs to watch, but I haven't heard of the others apart from Chibo. I'll be checking out the rest of them as well, thanks again!"
CrazyHand,3dsume,Crescentium,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:24:28 2015 UTC,"I usually charge up my Gyro when the opponent's off stage and I know they can't recover or during the invincibility time when I respawn. Charging it up at the beginning of the match can be risky since your opponent might rush you down before you can complete the charge.  Also, little fun fact here, Holy (A.K.A. HolyNightmare or Boreal_Holy) is Ally's older brother and they team with each other from time to time. I'm surprised people really haven't really heard of him, he's the first ROB I looked into for inspiration."
CrazyHand,3dsume,T_Peg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:15:11 2015 UTC,your ROB looks pretty solid just don't be afraid to use your Gyro and Laser more and go in for the D-Throw U-Air whenever you can. Think is a super tough matchup in general because as you mentioned they usually have impeccable spacing
CrazyHand,3dsume,RomyTono,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:39:40 2015 UTC,"I use Marth a lot, and I think I have more trouble against ROB than I do Toon Link. Not sure why."
CrazyHand,3dsume,RomyTono,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:02:41 2015 UTC,"It could be the utilization of projectiles. A lot of Links will focus their projectiles on what's in front of them, and because of that, it's not all too difficult to break through. The one in the video above is a little different, covering all angles of approach—bombs to the sky, boomerangs at varying angles, arrows from both the air and the ground. That's nearly full coverage, and even if you manage to break through, you still have to deal with a disjointed hitbox on (T)Link's sword. It's beautiful zoning at its finest, and like I said, not every Link utilizes it to the best of their ability, thus resulting in a less than spectacular zone game.   With ROBs on the other hand, gyros are a little more present; they stick around like Diddy's bananas but don't go away after walking on one. Essentially a spinning land mine, it gives the ROB player a little control over their opponent's movement—they'll either try to pick it up, jump over it, roll around it or powershield it to make it go away, and thus the ROB acts accordingly. On top of that, there's the additional laser pressure, giving ROB a pretty decent zone game as well.   I could be wrong, though; that's simply my perspective on the difference between the two."
CrazyHand,3dsume,T_Peg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:39:39 2015 UTC,"Most toons I play online and elsewhere do what the tink in the video does. I guess cause I'm so used to fighting Links online that it's become an easier matchup, which I can't say the same for ROB. Not many ROBs, and when I find them, they're fairly good."
CrazyHand,3dsume,RomyTono,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:41:49 2015 UTC,Maybe it's because Tink's projectiles are a little more predictable
CrazyHand,3dsume,T_Peg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:14:17 2015 UTC,"That could be it. Both Link and Tink take more time to use the boomerang, and ROB's laser comes out almost instantly."
CrazyHand,3dsume,omaximov,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:19:29 2015 UTC,also his projectiles aren't quite as versatile ROBs can come from any distance at any angle
CrazyHand,3dsume,georgedoesntclean,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:41:05 2015 UTC,"When you recover with ROB, try to initiate the up-b, then while holding up/the direction you want, tap b quickly. It'll save lots of gas. Also use back-air to save gas. If someone's aggressively edge guarding, you'll want all the gas you can get"
CrazyHand,3dsboi,lederpderp22,17,Sat Jul 18 23:57:11 2015 UTC,"Like any controller, it's all preference. Just try them all out and use the one which is most comfortable. I use the Wii U Pro controller because it just feels better in my hands, making it easier to play. The only benefits to using a GC controller, apart from preference, is the dents on the analog stick to make precise inputs easier and more accurate (such as Ryu's button inputs and Fox/Falco's recovery), and the C-stick is below the buttons, making it easier to do aerials and smash attacks quickly. I don't require that accuracy with Marth so it's not necessary, and the C-stick being above the buttons isn't as much an issue unless you're already use to it being below the buttons. Oh and also the GC controller shoulder buttons require more pressure than the Pro, so that's another reason why I prefer the Pro. It's just smoother. But like I said it's 99% preference and 1% not using Wiimote + nunchuck. Also if you like the Gamepad and want to attend tournaments, I'd suggest the Pro because it's the same layout, just no screen, and the Pad is banned in tourneys since you can only have 1 per system."

CrazyHand,3dsboi,Bullroarer_Took,2,Sun Jul 19 06:11:29 2015 UTC,I heard it on the Evo stream. Max Ketchum said it when he saw a player playing with a pro iirc.
CrazyHand,3dsboi,Shyinator,2,Sun Jul 19 06:45:13 2015 UTC,"I just recorded a high speed video from my phone and compared my input to the response on my TV (which has a VERY minimal display lag), and saw a few frames of lag from my Pro Controller. I don't have a GC adapter to test with, but I'm not so sure it's 0 frames lag. It's a USB adapter which has a certain latency, which is a hardware limitation. It might be less lag than the Pro Controller, but I can't imagine it would be by much.   I suppose a solution to this would be to have the game spoof an input lag for GC controllers, to put everybody on an equal field. It may have an effect on high level play, but I can't imagine that two frames would make much difference in SSB4, anyway, and it would level the playing field for all controllers."
CrazyHand,3dsboi,D14BL0,7,Mon Jul 20 09:46:13 2015 UTC,If there was a better option top players would use said option. GC controller is the best and until there are tourney results showing otherwise it remains the norm.
CrazyHand,3dsboi,I_SHIT_ON_CATS,7,Sun Jul 19 00:08:49 2015 UTC,"Tournaments are starting to ban them.   The most likely player to use a pro controller is a smash 4 native.

CrazyHand,3dsboi,-Googlrr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:50:07 2015 UTC,Its because of people screwing around because it is wireless apparently. All you need to do is hit sync after finishing a match. It's the same as unplugging a GCC.

CrazyHand,3dsboi,MikeRadical,5,Sun Jul 19 02:08:11 2015 UTC,"wired controllers are better. I use a wiimote with a classic controller attachment to play at home, as soon I go to a tourney it lags.

CrazyHand,3dtnl7,siriusleenoctis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:10:05 2015 UTC,Single jab to grab can work.
CrazyHand,3dtnl7,SpahsgonnaSpah,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:08:29 2015 UTC,"Downthrow can combo into both Uair and USmash depending on what the opponent does. If they immediately air dodge, I believe Up Smash is guarenteed and depending on their DI, Uair can connect (and kill).  Backair is a great tool since it beats out nearly every move thanks to Palutenas Shield Mechanics. Dash attack has the same effect but is not as spammable due to the immense landing lag if you miss.  Her tilts aren't great, Uair can be used for an anti air attack I suppose. They do have lingering hitboxes so they can punish things like Spotdodges but it is generally not worth the risk of using them.   Her Jab is also pretty useful, on top of having a good jab combo, the first hit of jab can actually combo into a grab which is where Palutena gets most of her damage from. This is a godsend for Palutena since her grab has a year of endlag so it is horrible if you miss it.  Out of Smash attacks, U smash is the one you will be using the most and even then, it is not a safe attack. All her Smash attacks have a lot of ending lag. Downsmash can punish rolls but it has odd hitboxes so it mighn't always work.  Her specials are mostly bad, neutral B is pretty garbage but it can do some nice damage to slower characters or those that just won't approach. Her reflector is probably the best in the game but is obviously useless against certain characters. Her counter isn't great either but it is still a counter I suppose, use it sparingly so it doesn't get predictable.  Her roll is and air dodges are great since they are invisible but they are punisable like every other roll so again, don't get predictable.  Palutena is a character people really underestimate but she has her fair share of weaknesses as well. Her air game is amazing but she falls short on the ground. There are a few really good guides on Smashboards that go way more in depth that I recommend checking out as well."
CrazyHand,3dtnl7,Raffo54,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:08:34 2015 UTC,"Uair and usmash are going to be your best kill options.  I think her tilts are really good. They're laggy on startup and ending, but they linger. Great for people who like to spot dodge, short hop in, or attack from directly above.  Usmash hits just below the ledge, so it's decent for edge guarding and it can kill easily, so keep that in mind.  Short hop Fair is going to be your best spacing option.  Your smashes are really laggy, so use them for hard reads or only when it's safe.   Side b ignores shields at point blank and it's one of the best reflectors in the game,  but it can break. Her counter is strong, but has really bad start and end lag, so only use it when you know it will work."

CrazyHand,3dszf6,ExtremeMagneticPower,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:22:54 2015 UTC,I usually have trouble with Samus and Toon Link.   Campy ones.
CrazyHand,3dszf6,Xentrik,2,Sun Jul 19 05:10:01 2015 UTC,"For either, try walking towards them (more control over your character than running) and shield appropriately. Once close enough, spot dodge grabs, SH and/or FF fair any further projectile throws (remember to always cross up to the other side of them to prevent shield grabs) assuming there is enough ending lag for you to react. Once you're up in their face, you're at the advantage. Read their rolls and remember your down throw combos!  Alternatively, you can jump high enough to line up a thunder jolt that will angle down and land on the opponent. If they shield, that's less time they can throw projectiles. Watch out if either of them attempt to run under you for an up smash--up B out of that! (Luigi and Mario will especially do this).  Thunder jolt will clash with Toon Link's boomerang and sometimes clash with the arrows. If TL charges an arrow and you're close enough, try doing a quick attack above and down into him. If he's near the edge, don't suicide, haha. You can try the jump high and thunder jolt on the arrows, too. Whenever landing when TL has an arrow charged, fast fall and refrain from air dodging, shield immediately when on the ground.   Same thing with Samus: she will try to catch you without a jump to use her charged shot. Never air dodge into the ground, which has a landing penalty. FF and shield immediately, or you have an option to quick attack up."

Try to limit your focus to two characters or at the very very most three because you will be stretching yourself thin trying to become good at all of them, but in the end you aren't very proficient at either. My pick for secondary is definitely RosaLuma due to the fact that she can deal with zoners a lot easier than C. Falcon can.

You will practice with Shulk exclusively until you are fantastic with Shulk. You will then re-adopt Falcon, and voila, you now have two solid characters. Rinse and repeat.  There's no 'limit' to the number of characters you can be good at. Test your abilities, challenge yourself, and enjoy yourself!"
CrazyHand,3dqqrf,John8apie,4,Sat Jul 18 15:22:51 2015 UTC,"I am personally a fan of the default setting with tap jump off, maybe put c-stick to attack to get those perfect pivot tilts or easier aerials. Never really customized it because I feel most comfortable with this set up."
CrazyHand,3dqqrf,SkyLightDance,3,Sat Jul 18 18:52:36 2015 UTC,"Comes down mainly to preference and which tech you want to pull off.

Which character do you play and is there any specific tech that you have trouble with?"
CrazyHand,3dqqrf,wingmage1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:31:53 2015 UTC,I main Ike and he has a lot of trouble with projectiles. I think I'll need to master the Jump Cancel Glide Toss tech...

CrazyHand,3dqqrf,wingmage1,2,Sat Jul 18 19:24:02 2015 UTC,"Not quite sure which benefits Ike gets from jump cancel glide tossing, but an easy setup is to put jump in right trigger. You jump with your index on R,  then use the cstick to throw your item."
CrazyHand,3dqqrf,wingmage1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:58:27 2015 UTC,"It's to help him against characters like R.O.B and Diddy, who have projectiles that stay active. You can do a nice slide to grab."
CrazyHand,3dqqrf,TeddehBear,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:00:48 2015 UTC,I imagine you must have some good ROBs in your region then. Just curious why you'd look for a control setup change specifically just to do a JC Glide Toss which is pretty situational since most controller changes usually have some sort of trade off (though jump on R doesn't really have any since you don't adjust the c-stick).
CrazyHand,3dqqrf,watermelonpickle,3,Sat Jul 18 18:17:56 2015 UTC,I like to set L to jump and C-stick to tilts so I can do retreating fairs. I also set X to grab.

CrazyHand,3ds2se,watermelonpickle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:12:47 2015 UTC,Her side-tilt combos into itself more than Mario's up-tilt.
CrazyHand,3ds2se,watermelonpickle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:26:00 2015 UTC,"Personally, I use Wario and Luigi as secondaries (I have several pocket characters that I rarely use in bracket as well.) Wario, because while his play style is different, he has similar aerial mobility and a good command grab, I use Luigi because I can be aggro with him but have a good grab game as opposed to Yoshi.   Of the two you mentioned, Sheik is going to be best for covering Yoshi's matchups and has a similar play style that you'll adapt to better, because while Sheik can be super aggro like Yoshi, Sheik can also needle camp, much like Yoshi can egg camp. Not to mention Sheik is the best character in the metagame."
CrazyHand,3doo7n,Bean315,3,Sat Jul 18 00:09:43 2015 UTC,"TheRealCarterer is a Dr. Mario main. Also, I don't see any hate from Dr. Mario other than from people who don't know the matchup. Definitely a character who is not being played much, if at all.  He's basically a slower Mario in exchange for more power. Doesn't have the same throw combos; the angle on his down throw is different so go for an up smash instead of up tilts. Down tilt is probably his best ground move; combo extender and racks up damage quick."
CrazyHand,3doo7n,jllmprrt,2,Sat Jul 18 03:23:40 2015 UTC,Jump and throw pills a lot to make defensive players move.  If you're getting jabbed you can mash up B to do massive damage to them.
CrazyHand,3doo7n,MegaNachovan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:29:48 2015 UTC,"Good luck first of all,  He is quite different than his melee version. No cape stall, up-b does terrible recovery-wise in scale to other characters in smash4, and its very hard to recover with down-b.  But he in return of bad recovery, he is pretty powerful. His fairs are great finishers, and he has a nice down smash. His combos aren't as good as normal Mario's though, because of his power boost. But strings are still very possible, just a bit harder to maneuver.  Grab combos with up-airs push to the left/right. You can string it into fairs if you get them off stage. At higher percentage (around 130 ish), back air will kill. Same with up-b, if you can combo into it, you can probably kill around 80-90, but on the ground it kill at 140"

CrazyHand,3doo7n,Overdrive95,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:35:27 2015 UTC,"Rule Number 1: Don't get knocked off stage. I personally feel that the Doctor has a worse recovery than freaking Little Mac.  Rule Number Two: Spam the hell outta the pills. Free damage is free damage. Shield Damage is free Down Tilts.  Rule Number Three: Your Up Smash is jank as hell. You think trying to recover on Omega Lylat Cruise is jank? Go Up Smash some people as the Doctor... Half the time it sends them diagonally away, the other half the time it sends them straight up... And somehow despite you thinking that is the only directions it will send people... It still manages to occasionally have next to no knockback despite them having stupid high damage. (Yes, it's all about where it hits, but honestly the different hitboxes are so close together that it's hard to really predict where they'll go)  Down Tilt is love, Down Tilt is life. At lower percentages, get a Down Tilt and go into some basic jabs, follow up with a short hop uair or two. Your combo potential is shit, but your string potential is fantastic. Sometimes you can go as far as dtilt, jabs, uair, uair, fast fall, dtilt, short hop, dair.  The Doctor Guillotine (AKA Your Nair) has stupid priority, repeatedly shff with a nair to really piss off your enemy.  Edgeguard with the Dr. Tornado. See them trying to grab the ledge? Jump off prior to them getting back and start spinning to deny them the ledge grab.  Pretty much all your Smash Attacks are kill moves, but I don't rely on the Up Smash because (as I said before) IT'S JANK AS HELL. Down Smash is the best IMO because it has more range than your Forward Smash and also comes out faster."

Attend them so much that being put on the spot is no longer a rare occurrence. You'll be used to it, it'll become second nature, it'll become the same as all those friendlies with your friends that you've been a part of.    That's all it is. And if you can't do lots of local tournaments, make a habit of grinding out Ranked matches on Smashladder. Keep grinding them and losing until you are no longer nervous or anxious and then you start performing well, because you get used to it.    All it is is experience. Look at ZeRo. He's able to keep his cool and stay focused every time because he's been in that position so many times now. But it didn't start out like that. It took a lot of going to tournaments and getting comfortable with it to get there.    Make it comfortable and familiar and easy with repetition. This is how everything works with nerves. Repetition into familiarity. When something is familiar your mind is clear and focused and content. Make being put on the spot in Smash something familiar to you."

CrazyHand,3dn72i,Maze715,3,Fri Jul 17 18:57:58 2015 UTC,"Neither a Brawl or Melee player, so just googled some things to add on to what /u/toastytroasty said. According to this wiki article, it was an integral part of momentum cancelling in Brawl.    Momentum canceling involves two steps: Once knocked into the air, a character must use an aerial attack as soon as possible, to end tumbling or reeling, and be able to act with other options. If knocked back horizontally, the character's fastest aerial is usually preferable, and in the case of Ike or Snake, an air dodge may be a better option. If knocked vertically, the character must initiate a fast fall, which can be achieved by using the C-Stick (or the Wii remote's D-Pad), to perform a down aerial in conjunction with the previous step. If knocked back horizontally, a special move that negates unwanted momentum should be used. If the character has none, a midair jump should instead be performed.   But this is not present in Smash 4. You won't be able to cancel momentum in this fashion; you will only cancel the tumbling animation by inputting an airdodge/attack. This is why even after you use an attack while flying off the stage, you might be out of hitstun, but continue blasting off.   But a little more on topic; again from googling, I found this topic which discusses that hitstun negation isn't present in Melee, thus no momentum cancelling. The users discuss that moves that alter momentum in free fall differ from moves that can alter momentum straight out of hitstun. So you can still use moves to alter momentum, but you have to get out of hitstun first...generally by cancelling the tumbling animation with an airdodge/attack. It'd probably be best to use the fastest/most efficient aerial.   Of course, any Melee/Brawl player feel free to correct. It's an interesting topic. Wish I could have found something more reliable on Smashboards, but it's a lot of threads to sift through."

CrazyHand,3dn72i,SquidLoaf,4,Fri Jul 17 17:28:42 2015 UTC,"I call this the ""Pokeball Effect"". When you are catching a pokemon, it's custom to mash all of your buttons to raise your chance of catching something. It doesn't actually do anything, but it seems to help psychologically.   When you get launched in smash 4, Pressing buttons (aerials) probably does the same thing."

CrazyHand,3dn72i,drewkid,2,Sat Jul 18 03:31:32 2015 UTC,"From the perspective of a melee Jiggs player: after hitstun ends, you go into a tumble animation. This animation can be ended by inputting a direction on the control stick-- which is where the ""wiggle out"" technique confess from. If you want to exit the animation without affecting your aerial drift you can input an aerial. I often will throw out a bair or fair while drifting back to stage. Hopefully this adds some insight"

CrazyHand,3dmdsa,SkyLightDance,3,Fri Jul 17 19:41:20 2015 UTC,"I will split up my advice into 2 sections, one for the character in question and the other will be in general.   General - Please grab those dash attacks! Every single dash attack in this game is unsafe on shield, and your friend did at least 50 of those on your shield. You can do stuff such as down throw into megaman's forward air or you can go do his up throw into his up air for juggles. I also noticed whenever you were in an unfavorable situation you tend to roll away which can be develop into a bad habit because it becomes predictable after a while. Try mixing it up by sitting in your shield or simply running. Character Specific - Use those pellets more often! You can jump after you shoot pellets to make it safe and apply more pressure. From there you throw megaman's metal blade or go for his forward/back air. Overall you want to use his pellets more often to pester/annoy the opponent into doing unsafe things. Try jumping more often! Megaman has great aerial movement for one reason or the other, and he can also shoot his pellets in the air to force someone out or to annoy someone. Try using the metal blade more often, he can shoot it in 8 directions very often and it is a very good tool that can rack up damage if the opponent isnt careful. Also try using down smash a bit less often, while it has amazing KO capabilities it is very easy to punish if you miss. If you want clarification or want more advise , feel free to ask!"

Do you have any tips on how to break this habit? Thanks.
CrazyHand,3dmdsa,Authentically,2,Fri Jul 17 21:19:16 2015 UTC,A decent option instead of rolling away is that fast pellet->SH away from your opponent. It retreats and uses the pellet as a pseudo shield without any lag.
CrazyHand,3dpolc,Epicmidget,12,Sat Jul 18 06:13:21 2015 UTC,Here's a good tip for breaking out of this habit:   Put the controller down. Close reddit. Take some deep breaths. Walk over to the console and change the disc to Mario Kart. Pick up the controller. Choose 50cc. Relax.

Just try being more mentally active during the battle and realize points where you should of teched. Maybe try setting a goal to help you tech more often.  As for teching stage spikes, I actually have a training method that helped me a lot. Simply go to training mode and put the bot to Ness. Set the damage to around 60 to make things a little bit easier, and try to keep knocking him off stage until he uses PK Thunder to recover. Jump in front of him and try to tech the stage spike. Alternatively you can do this with Captain Falcon or Ganondorf.   If you need any clarification, feel free to ask!"

CrazyHand,3dkxnj,Maze715,2,Fri Jul 17 05:16:17 2015 UTC,What I did to get used to teching is go to the Hyrule Temple stage and hang out in that bottom cave area. Your goal is to tech off the walls and live to ridiculous percents.  It also works on the Gamer stage with the monster mom. Just hang out under the hard areas and try to live.

CrazyHand,3dl7y5,RomyTono,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:31:32 2015 UTC,"Dash trotting is the best way to change direction, especially if you're captain falcon.

I'll just have to accept that it's tougher to execute on the 3DS and put in more practice. (My thumb's killing me though)"

CrazyHand,3dkagk,glacceon,6,Thu Jul 16 23:20:37 2015 UTC,"Being able to beat both kinds of people takes a lot of practice. You need to be on top of your punish game in order to beat out spammers that are usually on For Glory, especially being good at perfect shielding while running, and by the time you get to that point you've already been going toe to toe against very skilled players.    But you won't get there practicing on For Glory. You absolutely have to practice on Smashladder or with a group of very skilled people who also play on Smashladder or against themselves (like communities of smashers that usually hang on pro twitch streams like Nairo's or Nakat's sub groups), or people in person that are at that same very skilled level that destroy you, if you can. Playing against one of these people in person regularly is by far the fastest way to grow, if they're your friend and are willing to coach you all the way. But online communities work very well too.  Once you get to that point, when you run into a spammer, you'll find they're not impossible to deal with anymore. You'll find you're predicting their rolls every time and perfect shielding every projectile. It just happens. Even very very good players can have a hard time with roll spammers particularly when input delay is there. It's just more difficult to read in time due to the delay.    It just takes time, and you have to be willing to lose 100% of your games for a couple of months playing against the really good people. Make friends with them and have them coach and help you. Because if they're your friends, they're going to want to help you. Making friends is important! And so is being able to keep playing even if you never win a game, because you're learning. You learn much more from losing than winning.    edit: The other thing I forgot to mention, which is more than half of being successful at Smash and many other things, is managing your fear and your ability to stay focused. This is what separates the top tournament winners from everyone else at those tournaments. Odds are when you queue on For Glory and you see the input delay is high and/or you see someone start to roll and projectile spam or getting away with stupid things, or you see a Sonic or Rosalina or etc etc, your motivation drops and your frustration increases automatically. You've already given up at that point and you won't make smart decisions like when you do when you're 100% focused, and in something like smash bros, the winner is determined by who makes the least amount of mistakes. It's fear and nerves. These things will take the longest to master, but there are things that can help, the easiest biggest help being regular exercise. Other than that, you have to find a way to always be focused. I believe for Leffen it's his classical music. For many it's music while they play. You'll have to figure that one out for yourself. Keeping calm and focused no matter what is thrown at you."

If you play people within your region then chances are they will have a good connection, making for a near lagless match. Always ask for pointers after the match as well. After the interaction is complete you are asked to rate your competitors connection and their friendliness (this is pretty much a way to keep everyone nice).

CrazyHand,3dj7oj,Cereal_Ki11er,3,Thu Jul 16 20:13:42 2015 UTC,Go to a legit tournament and play casuals.  Get to know the players that can smash you flat and learn from them.  You can only reach the next level by playing against it.  Stuff like punishment you should be able to learn yourself though.  Play with people you know and try to punish moves on block or hiff with things like grabs before they can recover.  Most moves have ideal punishes based on spacing charcters and block/whiff.  A good example with bowser is simply bloking nearly any air move from the ground and immediately punish with up B.

CrazyHand,3dj7oj,T_Peg,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:48:46 2015 UTC,for advance tech check out the videos on Tourney Locator's YouTube channel called Tech of the Week and as for your trouble with punishing it's easy when the opponent fucks up you hit 'em it's as easy as that
CrazyHand,3dip9k,lorddane,3,Thu Jul 16 16:18:11 2015 UTC,"The most important thing is that you understand how close you have to be in order to grab them without a tech chase, since after a while (I don't know the frame data, or if it varies from character to character), they can get up. If you're close/quick enough, get the grab and go for whatever seems like the best option (usually DThrow or UThrow).  When they're a bit further away, it basically becomes a techchase. Are they gonna roll in, roll out, getup attack, or get up in place? I'd say most of the times, people will roll away or just get up in place and shield, but it's always gonna be different.  When I've read roll ins, I've gotten up smashes, which is a nice kill. With roll away, I usually get a dash grab, then throw them off stage to get them with edge guard gyro/laser shenanigans. Get up attacks can be shield grabbed, and neutral get ups can be grabbed, FSmashed, Up Smashed, or Down Smashed (or honestly almost anything).  When they're really far away, I usually try and time my laser to hit them as they do anything, since it usually catches them if I time it to hit right before they're action.  Another thing I like to do when I'm close is to short hop Fair to catch the gyro and hit them away, then throw the gyro at them. Sometimes this can be looped with multiple fairs > gyro tosses at low %."

CrazyHand,3djgy3,SmileyAja,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:12:02 2015 UTC,"So to decide your main,it usually comes naturally when you use a characther and you easily adapt to him and his attacks,and then you begin developing on him.You get used to him.But if you want to find one,here is how.  1.Play around with all the characthers,to see if you like anything at a characther,but another characther allows more techniques with that part of it you like.You will never realise that there was someone more compatible with the way you like playing until you see the characther's moveset.By that time you probably either almost or already mained your characther.  2.Do not pick characthers because of their looks,as someond who looks quite strong and easy to main as they may be the exact opposite.  3.Pick a characther that you feel is not too quick or uncontrolable,as maining them will take longer to get used to,and you will probably be less skilled with other characthers.  4.Pick a characther that has a moveset you are used to control,as learning new movesets will be as problematic as picking a characther paced faster than you prefer.It is not good to pick characthers that are harder to control because they are strong,but not easy to learn characthers as they are weak.

CrazyHand,3di1pn,Yurkii,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:16:13 2015 UTC,"You can make any character your main. You just have to put the time in. Some characters are going to take much longer to play efficiently though. Particularly characters like Peach, Ryu and Shulk. So just keep that in mind. And make sure you try to find videos and guides on whatever character you're trying to play. They're usually good starting points for what to practice and will showcase what moves and movement is safe and efficient and what isn't."
CrazyHand,3di1pn,watermelonpickle,2,Thu Jul 16 23:47:49 2015 UTC,"I cycled through a bunch of characters besides my main to find out their ranges and relative speeds. idk.

CrazyHand,3di1pn,superbadsoul,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:37:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's going to be hard going from a character with low mobility to one that is faster and more agile, because they just control very differently.   Is there a character with a slower walk, run and airspeed that you think you could learn?   I know for me finding a secondary it was all about needing airspeed like I get with Yoshi, so Wario was a good fit, even if he only covers a couple of matchups, at least I get better at the Sonic and Olimar matchup by having Wario."
CrazyHand,3di1pn,Capitan_Math,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:04:33 2015 UTC,"It's pretty natural. 20+ times is nothing compared to the probable hundreds or thousands of times you've played your main. Because playing your main feels so familiar, you may not even notice the fact that you are still learning and reinforcing various movements to this day. There are so many subtleties that take time and repetition to master, plus there are all the various matchups to learn. You may feel in control of all these secondaries you've tried, but that's really just your experience in the game showing. You're not nearly as in control as you are with your main til you've dumped a lot more hours in. Might want to narrow yourself down to just one of those secondaries and stick with it for a while."
CrazyHand,3di1pn,SmileyAja,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:14:47 2015 UTC,"actually, that makes sense. whenever i played one of these characters (like ZSS or Roy) i'd tend to use side b (which is robins really bread and butter move) a lot more than i should."

CrazyHand,3di1pn,Radicool21,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:16:28 2015 UTC,"You get used to your main's controls,speed,attacks and ect.  But when you play as some other characther you are not used to how they play,so you try to adjust to the characther in battle,which wil not end good,especially if someone is using their main.  The reason the Mains are called such is because you practice the characther's attacks,speed,capabilities,combos and such and you can use the characther especially well compared to another characther."
CrazyHand,3di1pn,Radicool21,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:01:10 2015 UTC,"Switched mains recently from Mega Man to Falco. I love MM, but I felt like he was a bit gimmicky. After the Ryu patch I tried Falco and loved his improved aerials, just fell in love with the character.  I went from being a developing player on FG to the worst player I've ever seen. MM and Falco have pretty similar weight and speed, I thought he would be easier to pick up, but it's only recently that I've been able to take games off of FG. I played my first Ladder games last night with Falco, got crushed but took some stocks.  It is HARD to switch. Especially switching from a character with a very unique move set."
CrazyHand,3di1pn,Radicool21,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:09:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you need to just decide on a secondary and then practice the hell out of that one character, rather than dipping your foot in the water for a bunch. Screw tiers or 'main compatibility', just pick one. I loved Fire Emblem, so after Robin I was like, ""I gotta try Ike."" Ike sucked balls pre-patch (and he still kinda does), but I had made my decision, practiced it, and eventually I stopped sucking as much. I saw Falcon and was like ""oh mother of god that's manly as fuck"" and then stuck with it, even though I kept getting rekt by S(p)amus and Megaman; and then one day I stopped losing as much.   When going for a second character I'd recommend picking up a character so different from your main that you couldn't possibly use the same strategy for either. Falcon for example, has no projectiles, is crazy fast, and relies on grabs and quick strings - pretty much the opposite of Robin. Similar scenario with Ike. In order to use them I had to learn an entirely different skill set (essentially starting from square one) and practice with it, so you're in a completely different mindset whenever you switch characters. Basically, reset yourself for every main - become a different person for each fighter you pick up, and switch between personalities as you do characters.  The best part about Smash 4 is that practically all the characters are viable, so at this point it's just a matter of fitting yourself to the character - not getting stuck on the one ""golden character"" that fits you."

CrazyHand,3di1pn,FireChickens,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:03:47 2015 UTC,"I'd be glad if you found it useful! ZSS and Roy are both great characters, but very different from Robin (as I'm sure you know). When you're picking them up, forget everything you knew about Smash and relearn everything. Even things like rolling, spot-dodging, dash grabs; these vary so much by character that you may as well be a newbie. When you lose to something, don't say ""I could've beaten it with Robin,"" instead treat the character you're using as the only option you have. If you don't have a fallback, the only thing you can possibly do is improve. Good luck!"
CrazyHand,3did81,Lucatora,3,Thu Jul 16 14:48:15 2015 UTC,"SHFF Nairs and Dtilts for spacing. Spot dodge when you know he's going for grabs and punish with utilt or jab, both of them can lead to followups. If grabbed, DI up and away from him, save your DJ. Oh, and don't use counter (unless you know it's gonna hit). A good Mario can read that and punish you hard. Deal with fireballs walking and perfect shield them. Mario doesn't have many weaknesses, but your attacks outspace him, you're probably not spacing properly."

CrazyHand,3dkb4b,ThunderFenixBR,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:26:07 2015 UTC,"Just play with it. I'm using it until I get gcn adapter, and I kind of like not having wires everywhere when I play. Just one thing to note is that if you hold the right control stick, it will charge a smash attack. Also for some reason (like in brawl) the right control stick makes you fast fall sometimes if you do an aerial."
CrazyHand,3dkb4b,jllmprrt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:54:35 2015 UTC,"If you have a 3DS, they're pretty similar in feel. Playing with the GamePad is a godsend after squeezing your hand into 3DS controls, although it takes a little time to get used to the width."
CrazyHand,3dkb4b,Radicool21,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:37:31 2015 UTC,"Just find a control scheme that suits you. I use a pro controller and change all the triggers but R to Sheild, turn tap jump off, and leave the second stick as Smash.  It's about how you're most comfortable hitting the buttons. If that means turning either X or Y to Sheild and forgetting the triggers, so be it.  That being said I'd ignore the R and L buttons and instead use just ZL and ZR, due to the different planes they're on and the fact that your hand will more naturally rest near those two."

Sometimes you've gotta play a bit more defensive to tease a mistake out of your opponent.   Example, me playing as lucas against rushdown CFalc on FG. Beat me once pretty bad, then I went on to 2 stock him 3 times in a row by simply hanging back, punishing, and then baiting him off the edge, letting him KO himself by trying to get me off stage. If that dude chilled out a bit, he could have easily beat me. Very funny matches, lol."

Lucina has some significant weaknesses in the meta, but it's nice that there might be a large enough skill gap at locals that you can do well with a lower tier character. Here's ZeRo's guide on Marth; lots of things carry over to Lucina.  The video is very good at explaining basics, and is more up-to-date. People grossly overestimated Marth and Lucina's strength in the meta in the 3DS days.  The only move not mentioned is the updated jab. Condition your opponent to deal with jab 1, and eventually you might get a jab 1 to F-smash, jab 1 to grab, jab 1 to shield breaker, jab 1 to jab 2, etc.   Then the rest is learning about things like landing traps, perfect pivoting, etc. Don't forget your fundamentals like spacing and conditioning."

You can get tilts out by either doing pivot tilts or slowly stopping. While running, hold the opposite direction, and after a split second, press A to pivot tilt. To slowly stop (that name is deceiving, i just couldnt come up with a better one) you just need to dash, gently move back the the joystick so that you keep the running animation but youre slower, then move it back more so you walk, and at that point you can start tilting. This takes practice, but you can do this very quickly. So quick that it is hardly noticable. It also gets rid of most of the skiding animation (most noticably Luigi's skid)."

All these people have given you good advice about what to use out of dash, but keep in mind that if your character has a nice walking speed (e.g. Fox, Marth, Lucina), you can use your walk instead to approach. You have literally all your standing options when you're walking, unlike a dash.  Also keep in mind that in a combo-heavy game like Smash 4, walking is not as abusable as it was in Brawl. Q.Q  Also, walk slowly -> dash is a way to trip up your opponent sometimes if you have a large difference in speed in those two options. It's honestly not very viable....... but keep in mind that it IS an option. lol"
CrazyHand,3dbgqp,TOBUSHCISH,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:31:57 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer and should be way higher.  Advanced players use so many other movement options besides dashing specifically for this reason.  Foxtrot to close distance.  Empty hop in to close distance.  Walk to close distance.  Perfect pivot to close distance.  Dash into a shield to close distance.  Dash straight into your opponent only when absolutely necessary, because it gives your opponent a lot of information about what you can do - they know you can't perform any of your neutral- or down-input attacks, so they don't need to respect those options.  If your opponent spot dodges with good timing, they've covered most of your approach options already and can punish with anything that comes out quickly.  But to your original point, yes, you CAN up-smash (jump cancel or simply c-stick up while dashing), pivot f-tilt (input opposite direction on the controller then attack shortly thereafter), and pivot f-smash (same as above, timing is much more precise and requires the inputs to be simultaneous) out of a dash.  The problem is that all of these options are covered by shielding."
CrazyHand,3dbgqp,KickToTheUterus,5,Wed Jul 15 15:15:10 2015 UTC,"Use shield. When you're running, tap the shield button without letting go of the direction you are pressing.   If you're used to letting go of the direction first, it will take you a bit to break the habit."
CrazyHand,3dbgqp,venderhain,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:42:54 2015 UTC,f-tilts and up smash can be preformed out of dash. Try using c stick if on wiiU.
CrazyHand,3dbgqp,Lacabuus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:06:19 2015 UTC,"Ftilt will take a lot of practice because your character has to stop moving before you can tilt. Practice the timing of stopping to Ftilt. You could also practice running into shield into ftilt. A bit related and very useful (and much easier) are pivot tilts, where you run away from someone as they attack, then flick the joystick back towards them and hit A. You'll instantly do an ftilt in their direction. Great for immediately punishing missed attacks when you're spacing.   Upsmash however is extremely easy. Just flick the C-Stick up while running. You'll immediately upsmash.    Another trick related to this is dash attacking from a standing position. You hit forward a split second before you flick the C-Stick down. You'll dash attack from a stand still and you can keep doing it over and over without ever needing to actually dash. If your character has a good dash attack it is very important to get comfortable with this move."
CrazyHand,3dbgqp,sevenmd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:57:38 2015 UTC,"If you foxtrot you can do an fsmash out of it. Also I've noticed that if you run a short distance, it takes a long time to stop to be able to do another input, but if you run father you can stop quicker."

See what others do that you don't with said character, then add it to your skills. Since others are going to spend more time playing one character than others, it's usually safe to assume that they'll generally have more knowledge in that character. Ask them for tips on their character and see if you can also apply it to other characters. Also, some good general techniques to learn are pivots, RAR, shield dropping, and out of shield moves you can do. Look some of those up, videos will do a lot better job of explaining than I can."

CrazyHand,3ddqyo,rahsosprout,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:59:19 2015 UTC,"I'm at work so I can't give you much, but real fast.  With Yoshi, abuse eggs and b-reverses, his air speed makes his b-reverse absolutely ridiculous for getting away from an opponent, catching someone in an egg lay, as a movement option and you need to use it a lot. Eggs cover so many options from a defensive standpoint and can make approaches very safe, as you can force an option, they extend strings, start combos and setup gimps, they also keep you safe on recovery,  so get good with eggs, it's a must for Yoshi. Also, remember that nair has absurd speed and hits on both sides, it's great for walling and as an OoS option.  With Wario, neutral b is your best friend as it is an extremely fast command grab that people often run right into, you can also use it if you notice they shield aerial approaches, also great for Edgeguarding, if spaced well it covers standard get up, attack get up, sometimes jump get up, and eventually you can condition a roll get up to punish with an f-tilt. F-throw is your kill throw. With the bike, mix up your timing of when you jump off, remember that it gives you an extra jump so your recovery is god like, and don't forget to mixup with wheelies. One last thing, if you fart on the bike you get an extended hitbox, so keep that in mind."

After you make an account on there, you'll need to click on your name at the top right of the page and select ""Game settings"" to select which games you want to compete in. You'll also want to click on your name, go to your profile, and find the place where you can specify your NNID and whether you have Dreamland or not if you're competing in Smash Wii U. You'll find it in the Smash Wii U section of your profile page.   The main page where you'll be spending most of your time is on the ""Chat"" page. Click that at the top of the page. To the right, you'll see a Friendlies box and a Ranked box. To show up in one of those, click ""Play"" > Select your game > Click Friendlies or For Glory (Ranked), then specify if you wanna do best of 3 or 5 (or unlimited which is an option in Friendlies only). After this, you'll appear in one of the corresponding boxes on the right side of the page. If you don't want to wait for someone to challenge you, you can click on the blue Smash logo beside someone's name to challenge them instead. Just be sure to keep in mind which section they are queued up under, Friendlies or Ranked. From there, if they accept you or if you accept a challenge, you will be pplaced into a private chat with your opponent. From there, I think watching this video will explain the rest.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDsGFpeQ6NY  Hope this helps! Lmk."
CrazyHand,3dcdrt,theycallmebraniac,3,Wed Jul 15 04:15:33 2015 UTC,"My experience with the gamepad and pro controller is that the analog sticks are very sensitive. Hence any little nudge and you do a f-throw instead of a d-throw, or you'll b-reverse without intending to.   Unfortunately, I haven't got any helpful advice besides to practice more to get used to the sensitivity. It's like when you change your mouse speed from the default setting to as-fast-as-possible; it can take some time getting used to the speed for accurate clicking.  Technique-wise, do let your stick return to neutral by itself rather than pushing it to neutral. You don't have to press down into the control stick either--I find myself doing this sometimes due to nerves causing a tighter grip, and it starts hampering the ""feel"" of my inputs."

CrazyHand,3db9ba,legacygrim,6,Tue Jul 14 22:51:50 2015 UTC,"With the noted exception of d-air none of ZSS's aerials have noticeable landing lag though I'm not sure if they technically ""auto-cancel.""  There is really nothing to practice outside of short-hop -> aerial -> fast-fall.  If you are NOT stuck in landing lag then it either worked or is a lag-less aerial anyway...doesn't really matter at that point.   Either way as ZSS you shouldn't be fast-falling anything except n-air, b-air and VERY rarely u-air anyway (none of which require anything special to be lag-less).  NOW GO N-AIR TO DOWN-B SPIKE SOMEBODY WITH YOUR NEW TECHNOLOGY"
CrazyHand,3db9ba,DSkro,5,Wed Jul 15 00:23:12 2015 UTC,"F-air has a decent amount of landing lag unless you time your landing correctly; shortly after the hitbox of the second kick vanishes. To use it effectively (outside of special circumstances) avoid using it out of a short hop, and avoid fast falling while using it.  To add to your list, remember that Zss has a z-air which auto-cancels on landing, making it an incredibly safe spacing tool. Just make sure you're careful not to throw it out too far away from the ground (it has an incredibly long animation that is safer to cut short by landing than it is to let it run it's course)."
CrazyHand,3db9ba,Arkbot,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:50:41 2015 UTC,I believe you can short hop fair and autocancel if you start the move frame one after jumping. This is easier to do with tap to jump and using cstick to buffer the aerial during the jump squat.
CrazyHand,3db9ba,Delslayer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:00:47 2015 UTC,"I will have to test this out; I know I've used the full hop variant in the past much like Fox's helicopter jump from Brawl, but never the short hop. Though just curious, what about tap jump makes it easier? Feel like the control needed to short hop with the analog stick would almost cancel any benefit derived from tasking the inputs to separate fingers; feel like you could get the same effect by having jump set to a shoulder button."
CrazyHand,3db9ba,Arkbot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:55:18 2015 UTC,"https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/3btg5t/smash_4_control_tech_double_sticking_auto/  I learned about it from this vid. Apparently you can only buffer arials with the cstick if you've used tap to jump, it doesn't work with any other jump input, the jump would just be cancelled."
CrazyHand,3db9ba,Delslayer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:59:49 2015 UTC,"Finally got the chance to hit the lab and I see what you mean. Using button inputs (no tap jump), I can only get the initial short hop f-air off; it all frame cancels on landing but it can't string into itself, just an f-smash on first available frame.  Having said that this is insanely easy to do using either y or x for jump and a+left analog for the f-air. Right thumb literally goes in one continuous movement from x to a. The only disadvantage being that to move backwards while attacking using this method you have to have some pretty fast fingers."

CrazyHand,3db5vu,thebluecrab,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:14:19 2015 UTC,"As a WFT main, I agree.  Most Luigis spam fireball in neutral, even outside of it's range, to limit approach options and find a way in. SS has a longer range and even though it is nowhere near as spammable, it messes with Luigi's standard approach pattern.  That being said, Luigi's ridiculously easy combos, strong aerials, and fast smashes still make him challenging to contend with if he gets in. I'd probably still put the match-up in Luigi's favor as long as the player is able to adjust, but it's close because of WFT's strong off stage game."

If you are sticking with charizard, the only thing I can really suggest is just taking advantage of sheik struggling to kill and use rage and charizards power to your advantage."

If off, slightly cry before each match. When she's juggling with fairs, try to get a rock smash out. Don't try to use any aerials on her, except maybe fair. Just try to camp it out. Remember that fly has super armor, and it's really reliable damage, it kills, and its good out of shield."
CrazyHand,3dbxuh,Blueowl789,2,Wed Jul 15 02:03:03 2015 UTC,"Smash 4 is weird, because it has a combination of DI and vectoring after all the patches and stuff. It has gotten so mixed up that a video with visuals is A LOT easier to understand. Just a side note, this is the DI that can help you live longer.   http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PnqgfP7vrTs   As for DI that deals with getting hit is pretty simply and easy to explain. Whenever you get hit, you are able to change the trajectory you are launched by simply using the control stick. You got hit and you want to move to the right? Simply hold the control stick to the right and you will move to the right. This is useful for when you are getting trapped in juggle moves such as Mario's up tilt and Sheik's forward tilt.    If you need any clarification, feel free to ask!"
CrazyHand,3dbxuh,SkyLightDance,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:15:43 2015 UTC,"In this game it's not as effective as previous games, But it is something to know how to do. It's also pretty simple. As soon as you see yourself getting hit with a move, hold the control stick in the direction you want to go and you will go that way. If you are getting hit toward the blast zone, hold toward the stage and that is considered effective DI. It's really muscle memory once you get it down; I tried explaining it to my brother and was having trouble lol"
CrazyHand,3dbxuh,jllmprrt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:06:41 2015 UTC,"It seems there must be more to it than that. Is it that you have to input the direction almost before you are hit?   I have heard that mashing the direction you want to go with both the directional stick and the smash stick (smash/tilts whichever) repeatedly is the most effective. I have also heard that holding both in the direction steadily is most effective.   I have seen people survive things that should have absolutely KO'd them using effective DI, so I feel there must be more to it than just mashing in the direction you want to go (like for example, mashing down while you are flying upwards) - which seems to have little to no effect.   I know this is also the way you can effectively escape things like repeated mario/fox uptilts and repeated ness PK fires etc. if you DI in the right direction... but once again, I am skeptical that the most effective way to do this is to simply hold in the direciton you want to go.   am I mistaken?"
CrazyHand,3dbxuh,mirjak,2,Wed Jul 15 02:14:14 2015 UTC,"The blast zone on every stage is a box. A giant box. Do die, you must leave this box. Sounds simple. The most effecient way to get out of the box is simple. You need to travel perpendicular towards the nearest edge of the blast zone. When you are killing your opponent, this is your goal. Although DIing will not decrease knockback, you can DI in such a way that a larger distance must be traved to get out of the blast zone. How does one accomplish this? Well, if the smallest distance between a point and a line is by going at a 90° angle, then increasing or decreasing this angle will increase the amount of knockback required. So just DI any direction? Not exactly. Since we are dealing with a box and not a single line, we need to DI toward a perfect spot where it is farthest from any relevant blast zone. This magical spot is the corner. It sounds simple, and it is. People put DI on a pedistol and make it seem like a revelutionary tech, but its just basic reasoning. So now you know. When you DI, point the stick so that the angle of your stick and the angle of your launch average out to the angle towards the corner youre going toward."
CrazyHand,3dbxuh,jllmprrt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:02:28 2015 UTC,"You don't mash the button, and k don't believe the C stick has anything to do with it in this game. Just hold the button. Maybe if you're getting caught in multi hit attacks like up tilt spam then maybe mashing is the way to go. I don't have access to the game right now or I would do it and then tell you."
CrazyHand,3dbxuh,yogachiken,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:20:47 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, Smash 4 uses both DI and vectoring, which is unique to it. The most important thing to remember is that DI should be used when your trajectory is vertical and vectoring should be used when your trajectory is horizontal (in order to survive longer).  DI changes the angle of your trajectory. If a move would send you straight upwards, simply hold left or right on the control stick and your angle will change slightly in that direction. Make sure to do it while the move is being performed, or it won't work.  Vectoring changes the actual distance you travel, not the angle. If a move would send you totally horizontal to the right, hold the control stick to the left as the move is performed, and you won't travel as far as you otherwise would. Simply reverse the inputs as needed.   Keep in mind that what I told you is only the basics for surviving. It doesn't necessarily hold true for getting out of certain moves. Most of the information I wrote was taken from this video. I recommend watching it for a more thorough explanation."
CrazyHand,3dalal,TheBlackLuffy,9,Tue Jul 14 20:02:04 2015 UTC,"Crouch after every kill. EVERY kill.  But in all seriousness, Dedede is about spacing. He's really slow, and a lot of his attacks require a big commitment, but his hammer's reach is really good, so you can keep your opponent at a safe distance with it. F-tilt and B-air are your best tools for spacing, Gordos are nice too, but use them sparingly and always from a distance where you can shield if they get hit back. F-air isn't as nice of a spacing tool because it doesn't auto-cancel like his B-air, and the landing lag leaves you open for a punishment. N-air is great for approaching if you need to, as is his B-air (though you shouldn't approach if you don't have to).   Another thing to keep in mind is his off-stage game. Dedede has great recovery, so don't be afraid to go deep to gimp, just be careful you don't accidentally fast fall after an aerial, that's a deadly mistake. F-air and B-air are your gimp tools, but if you want to style your opponent, a D-air spike can be done if you have excellent timing. One thing I like to do if I have a stock lead is try to read my opponent's recovery options, and Inhale where they need to go. Like against Mario, I stay ahead and above where he is, so if he double jumps, he'll get sucked in, and if he doesn't he'll fall too far down to recover. EXTREMELY risky but so satisfying.  3D's ground game is nothing to sneeze at either. D-tilt is a very fast mix-up, his jab can lead into a grab or D-tilt, and U-tilt leads into some good aerial follow-ups. Try not to use his smash attacks too much though, they're all slow with some wonky hitboxes (especially up smash) so only use them if you can make some monster reads on the opponent. As for his throws, the only real useful one is down throw, because it has great follow ups. N-air at low percents, F-air or U-air at mid percents. The beauty of his hoo hah is that right after his U-air is no longer a combo out of D-throw, is around the time that it'll start killing. At around ~100% you can read an airdodge out of D-throw and kill with an U-air, though this won't work as reliably against higher level opponents.  That's all I can really tell you about the Deedster. I don't claim to be a good player, nor even a good Dedede player. But I have been playing him a lot on both FG and Anther's, and this is what I think of him personally. Hope that this was of some help!"
CrazyHand,3dalal,Clumbone,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:53:22 2015 UTC,"Gordos are nice too, but use them sparingly and always from a distance where you can shield if they get hit back.   Gordos are a tool better used at close range when not in neutral. When you're both in the air and you need the reach, or when they've committed and you can punish their landing - those are the two best situations to gordo them actively. The other use is to cover options - high-bouncing a gordo to force them into range of one of your other attacks.  Throwing long-range gordos isn't a good option."
CrazyHand,3dalal,8drawr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:19:35 2015 UTC,"To each their own. I'd never throw out a Gordo at close range because they have considerable start up, and if they're hit back at that range, then I can't do anything about it because I'm stuck in endlag. At longer ranges, they can still be an issue, but I can shield a returning one if needed."
CrazyHand,3dalal,Clumbone,2,Wed Jul 15 23:01:39 2015 UTC,"Dedede isn't a defensive character, he's a patient character. He has good grab range and down throw combos. Gordos aren't for neutral, save them for edge guarding and punishing landings and such. Down tilt is frame 3 and has a lot of priority. Nair can help you land."
CrazyHand,3dalal,Electrical_Beast,2,Wed Jul 15 04:50:00 2015 UTC,"I love DDD but it's a rough road.  He has a lot of bad matchups and few approach options. He doesn't play like any other characters, and you're going to have to get very good at controlling his bobbing in order to juke around a bait people. Very high level play is going to be a bad time. You're going to work twice as hard for kills and rely on your opponents' mistakes. I've mained him since brawl day 1 and he's a son of a bitch. He's proof that tiers are real. But he's still fun.  Upsides:  great grab combo game  solid spacing  amazing fastfall  super high survivability  big hits are a good time  sassy squat"
CrazyHand,3dalal,8drawr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:29:31 2015 UTC,"An extremely helpful mixup I recently discovered:  You can hold down after using your recovery to skip the ledge snap.  Normally most characters don't really care about this, but with 3D you can skip the ledge and get a solid hit or even a KO at higher percentages."
CrazyHand,3dalal,LaughingRochelle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:44:25 2015 UTC,"From another thread:  Alright, so here's my current way of playing KD3. Usually works pretty well.   Always, ALWAYS keep a Gordo in play (side-B), but also keep an eye on it- it's easily reflected back at you if you don't pay attention to its directional controls (you can choose up, down, or side trajectories). Keeping a Gordo in play will give you spacing options and help rack up damage effectively. (just getting tapped by a Gordo KOs at 150%!) Your dash-slam has great hitbox range and it kills edge-hangers with no invincibility frames, and it hits people just about to cling on the edge. Good timing with this will pay off.  Your side-tilt has a good range and good startup times, use this in combination with your neutral jab to space people and nullify their approaches. IMPORTANT: If you charge an F-smash, and your opponent simply waits outside the f-smash's range before charging at you, your neutral jab is fast enough to punish that charge. This is handy. Super Dedede Jump is very powerful- it's got incredible range, slides up angled stage bases, and it can kill/bury opponents.  Your d-smash is the quickest one you've got- it'll kill at around ~100%, using this effectively will ensure a KO.  Use your down-B on falling opponents (that have used their recovery). It's got good range in the air, and you can charge it on the ground and jump to use it. Your up-smash swings all the way around- use this on opponents that stand on one side of you and don't expect it! It's hard to pull off, but if your dair's sweetspot connects, it's got a glorious, GLORIOUS meteor smash."
CrazyHand,3dalal,_IAlwaysLie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:24:54 2015 UTC,Side smash destroys souls. Side special can angle upward to bounce close in front of you or edge guard. Dash attack kills.
CrazyHand,3dalal,ambi94,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:44:54 2015 UTC,"One thing I will note as an ex Dedede Main (I grew tired of his massive amount of hard matchups) is the FEAR. Forward Smash is scary. EVERYONE knows this. A lot of players panic when faced with Fsmashes, and things like that. Throwing in random Fsmashes at times can REALLY fuck with your enemies head. Dedede can take the punish if he eats it, but all it takes is a single reactionary spotdodge, a low shield hold, or even a misspaced move to die."
CrazyHand,3dalal,Fawful,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:20:40 2015 UTC,"Lots of people have already given great starting advice, but I'll add in this little bit. Remember that DDD is a heavy character and arguably the hardest in the game to actually kill. Don't get discouraged if you find yourself eating a lot of attacks. Like ganon and bowser, you only need to land a couple to match them. Even if you have a percent disadvantage, chances are your opponent has less killing options than you. Take fox for example, he'll rack up damage on you really quick, but once you get into kill range he becomes super predictable. He's always fishing for the Usmash/Uair. While you have to worry about these two moves, he has to worry about: Fsmash, Usmash, Dsmash, Gordo, Dtilt, Uair, Bair, Nair, on top of all of DDD's gimping options."

CrazyHand,3dapxs,shulkario,6,Tue Jul 14 20:33:40 2015 UTC,"You can't really avoid it per say, as the only way to avoid this whole situation is to not get grabbed.   If you are playing a character that has fast falling properties you can DI down when his chain starts and shield his up tilts. This gives you a free punish with things such as a shield grab. This will only work at very low percents, but that doesnt matter due to the fact that is when Mario's combo is most annoying. For everyone else, you will simply have to DI up and away to prevent Mario from chaining more up tilts.    If you have any questions, feel free to ask."
CrazyHand,3dapxs,SkyLightDance,2,Tue Jul 14 20:41:43 2015 UTC,You can also DI upwards and doublejump  Or mash an aerial with little starting frames.

CrazyHand,3dapxs,thebluecrab,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:15:08 2015 UTC,Its not an advantageous position to be in the air up high having used your double jump.
CrazyHand,3dapxs,saxonius,4,Thu Jul 16 09:44:35 2015 UTC,"I'll try to give some insight on this as a Mario main.  What you're probably experiencing is the u-tilts that follow a d-throw at 0%. In regards to it being a true combo, it is and it isn't. Fast-fallers like Fox, Falcon, etc can just hold down, changing their DI and land on the floor before the first u-tilt even comes out, but those are special cases.   For the normal or slow fallers of the game, 2 or 3 u-tilts are pretty much guaranteed after that d-throw, due to the low knockback and speed of the move. But by DI'ing up and away from Mario, any character should be able to jump/air dodge/upB out of the chain after a max of about 3 u-tilts, sometimes even 2. A good Mario will be able to read when the opponent is about to escape the u-tilt chain, then follow up with rising u-airs or an upB of his own, but that's for you to react to."

I'm guessing you're either having trouble with falcon or fox short hopping, so just practice and you'll get it eventually. Something that really helped me is not to press it as fast as you can but to be very light with your touch and release the button as fast as you can.

CrazyHand,3d99n3,kenny9292,17,Tue Jul 14 14:29:53 2015 UTC,"Empty hops, like any other movement option, are just a way to mix up your approach and keep opponents from reading you.  They're not any more or less essential than foxtrotting, foxtrot dancing, pivoting, perfect pivoting, jump cancelled glide tossing, character-specific ATs, shielding, rolling, dashing, or even using smash attacks.  It's all about analysis of the situation and execution of the correct option when an opportunity is presented.  Just to give you some ideas for how to incorporate empty hops into your movement for the characters you mentioned:  Yoshi:  Pressure with eggs, pressure with falling Nairs, then empty hop in and, depending on their reaction, either punish a grab attempt with an up smash or grab them yourself and gain some stage control.  Ness:  Space with retreating fairs and PK Fire to condition the opponent into shielding when you jump.  I think you can figure out the rest, what with your scumbag back throw and all.  Lucas:  I have no idea, I hate this character and he should have stayed dead in Brawl where he belonged.  (Just kidding, use empty hops to bait a grab and wind up an up-smash while they're approaching for easy breezy mid-percent kills.  You'd be surprised how many people walk into this.)  Shulk:  Empty hops are a great variation which will allow you to get in close to an opponent for a grab after spacing them out with the insane range on M O N A N D O B O Y's aerials.  Toon Link:  Seeing as how Toon Link is not an approach based character, empty hops are mainly useful for trying to bait an opponent into approaching you while making yourself harder to hit; just remember that jumping is a huge commitment in SSB4 and if you don't have a plan when you do it, you'll probably eat a little punishment."

CrazyHand,3dao61,Pahoyhoy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:04:42 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about roll spam or projectile spam, or both? For roll spam we'll need to know what characters you play as every character has different tools to deal with that.   As far as projectile spam goes, unless you have something to absorb projectiles or reflect them, the most efficient method is to practice perfect shielding while dashing until you get the timing down perfectly. Once you get that down they simply don't have the time to spam you anymore before you get a chance to hit or grab them. You must perfect shield most or all of their projectiles while always dashing towards them. The timing gets easier with practice.  Have a friend spam you with projectiles of each character on the ground so you can get used to the timing with the character you play, because the timing will be a bit different based on your run speed too.    Doing this requires you to be familiar with dashing into shield, which is dashing and then holding shield while still holding forward. You'll slide into a shield, but it takes a moment for the shield to come out,  which is where timing things gets a little tricky for perfect shielding projectiles. You have to hit shield a bit before the projectile hits you because it will take a moment for the shield to activate while dashing. With practice though it gets much easier."

CrazyHand,3dbe0l,Rapayus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:28:29 2015 UTC,"A lot of Pac-Men like to play campy- it's his optimal playstyle. He throws up a wall, brick by brick, in hopes of keeping you away from his hurtbox, and what you need to do is tear that brick wall down. This can be done by throwing the bricks back (cape), shielding what he throws at you (perfect shielding is a useful skill to learn here) or weaving around all of it. Overall, working on your movement and reaction time will help a lot when you need to deal with campers like Pac.  Sheik has no negative matchups."

Then i empty hop into a down-b myself and reflect that shit back at them. Other then that i never let them breathe.

Really it all boils down to Sheik beating all of them, but if you don't want to play Sheik here are some bad matchups for the characters you mentioned;  Rosalina: Yoshi is nasty against Rosalina, eggs and raw dash attacks can deal with Luma and Yoshi has a dirty juggle game on her, and a nasty Edgeguarding game as she has no hitbox on her recovery.  Sonic: Wario is the Sonic killer, if he goes for a spin dash, just use neutral b and catch him in your mouth. Bike messes with it too. You can basically neutralize his spinning by holding B. There's probably more to it than this but that's the big part of the MU for Wario.  Pikachu: Luigi kills him, Pika is a light fast faller so Luigi can combo him for days and kill him fairly early with a d-throw>rising tornado.  Luigi: other than Sheik and Rosalina I'd say Fox, Yoshi and Ness can all handle him.  I'll try to come back and add more detail when I have the time."

While your opponent in real life probably isn't going to be perfect-shielding 99% of the things you throw at them, it's good to develop contingency plans for when it does happen.  But keep in mind that a CPU will never play like a human. Humans can be tricked, CPUs can't. There's no mind games with a CPU.   You mention that you play a lot of For Glory. Since you're playing online mostly, I'd recommend finding a Twitch streamer to play with. A lot of streamers, like Fow, will play with their viewers.

CrazyHand,3d9gd9,Eontios,4,Tue Jul 14 21:49:22 2015 UTC,"A lot of people harp on playing against level 9's, but a frame perfect bot does teach some things:  A) True frame traps. If a CPU air dodges perfectly, you can start working on airdodge set ups (for example)  B) Bait and punish. Level 9's will use an attack that will connect at max range based on your current approach. If you alter it before you get to them, they miss, you punish. Also the perfect defense deters approaching yourself, so it helps encourage defensive and patient play.  I typically practice against level 9's, but that's to build a close to frame perfect mindset for myself. I think the belief that playing aginst them because they cheat is actually kinda silly, seeing as how you can get good against something that cheats, than something that can't should have a harder time (should).   I would try to mix in some player practice too since your ability to stay fresh and mix up your game is highly relevant against humans and completely irrelevant against cpus.

CrazyHand,3da6im,Sir_Upvote,2,Tue Jul 14 18:22:15 2015 UTC,"Here is my write up on the Ness match up from smashboards.  So after I got harshly stomped on by Meccs on stream this week at my weekly, I've been putting a lot of thought into the Ness match-up. This seems like a good time to talk about this match-up since I believe the massive buff to PSI magnet in patch 1.0.8 has changed the dynamics of pika's neutral game quite a bit.   While it was never safe to use t-jolt against Ness, pre-patch at least he had to commit to something laggy to reflect/absorb. Now that psi magnet is totally free (end lag reduced to only 4 frames down from 20) t-jolt and thunder are almost removed from our tool kit. With only QA left in our bag of gimmicks pika is left to play an almost shudder honest neutral game. In my sets versus my friend's Ness (over wi-fi sadly) I was pleased to find how effective pika's grounded spacing and footsies game is against Ness. Ness has great tools to box out Pika with his super disjointed and fast SH fair, the occasional well spaced PK Fire, and a decent to good jab and tilts. He even had decent anti QA tools with SH nair and cheesy onstage PK thunder stuff.   The big thing he lacks however, is any reliable way to approach a grounded pika. Dtilt is great in this match up, as it stuffs all of Ness's grounded approach options (maybe dash attack is disjointed enough to be a problem, but I haven't experimented with that yet, shouldn't be too big of a problem as it is super unsafe on shield). I also found that D-smash to be a decent anti aerial option against Ness for when a falling fair is poorly spaced.   Since Ness can convert so well off of a grab at almost any percent, baiting dash grabs is likely to be a big part of this match up. I find that one effective mind game is to deliberately wiff an f smash and then punish the dash in with a d smash. This isn't safe by any means, but since it hits frame 8 (only 2 frames later than our fastest tilt or standing grab) and has enough knockback to possibly set up an edge gaurd. D-tilt and SH nair are also ok options, since the get space and might force a tech chase scenario or set up a jab lock, but between these two D-tilt is the best option as it has way more range and shouldn't get shield grabbed or stuffed by a SH fair or dash attack.  There's tons more to say about this match up, especially on off stage shenanigans, effective and safe QA useage and how not to get grabbed, but I'm quickly getting out of my depth on this subject. I'm going to guess that a lot of pikachu mains are going to say that pika might lose this matchup, but I think that is because Ness' strengths define the matchup more than pika's. But even if Ness restricts pika options quite a bit, and even if he has really janky easy kills I suspect pika might still have more ways to win. Though it's probably super even.  Now for some ESAM footage. All Pika mains should study this set that was played last week between ESAM and Shaky at a weekly in south florida. It contains not only some of the highest quality Pika and Ness play I've ever seen, it might just be one of the better sets of smash 4 to have taken place so far.

CrazyHand,3d8zfy,Volkamar,2,Tue Jul 14 13:01:41 2015 UTC,"Nice video; it was helpful to see a variety of FG matches to analyze. From first glance at your playstyle, it seems you're uncomfortable with your opponent in close quarters...which doesn't work out for you if you're Roy, meant to thrive in the CQC situation.      Too much rolling and thrown out smash attacks. Rolling is an issue because often times your rolls are unproductive. They put you further away from the opponent (giving them room to breathe) and sometimes made you unable to punish because you were too far away due to a roll. Try working in pivoting to stay close to your opponent, patiently shielding, or spotdodge. As for smash attacks, Roy's have quick startup but still have endlag, and are punishable if whiffed. Use tilts instead, which are quicker and let you pressure the opponent nonetheless. The same no-no goes for thrown out Blazer, Flare Blade, and d-air--really any laggy and punishable move in neutral unless it's a consistent punish or hard read.    Converting off throws: I didn't really see utilization of Roy's great grab game besides throw-->attack. You can chaingrab at low percents by doing d-throw to jab to re-grab. You can set up landing traps by doing d-throw to u-air to re-grab. You can read an airdodge after a d-throw and go for u-tilt. You can move yourself to the side and start a n-air string into more damage. F-throw to sourspot f-air for a reset if they don't tech. B-throw to n-air strings or sweetspot b-air to finish. Lots of mix-ups come from Roy's grabs, and you can get a lot more out of them. Don't forget to pummel at high percents, or even play a mindgame and pummel to a grab release-->hard read f-smash.  Approaches/Bread-and-butter: Roy's sh-fair is not an approach option. It has no range, is unsafe on shield, and does nothing to pressure unless you b-cancel it. There wasn't a use of empty short hops to mix-up approaches. There wasn't any reactive punish to the opponent's approaches--you tried to approach every time you could. Most concerning, I didn't see any strings at all which make up Roy's BnB, and Roy has a plethora of moves that tie into each other. For example, f-throw to shff-nair to Blazer. Converting off throws and then following into jab, tilt, or aerial setups is one of Roy's biggest strengths.    I guess to summarize, your main improvement focus should be on the neutral game. No reckless, telegraphed, thrown-out, punishable attacks. Stop using rolling as your only defensive option; utilize other defensive options, even movement. Abuse Roy's grab game. Learn Roy's combo/string potential. Maybe a tiny bit on mastering Roy's recovery. Be aware of Omega stages that have straight walls, since it'll help characters that can wall jump or opponents that tech well; even Pikachu's t-jolt becomes more dangerous. Or the stage will gimp your recovery if you don't space, like in your first match with Pit.   To demonstrate my first point, let's go over the first match with Pit.  Unproductive rolls (probably more than this) at 0:13, 0:24, 0:26, 0:36, 0:40, 0:46, 0:55, 1:05, 1:08, 1:21, 1:22, 1:24, 1:37, 1:42, 1:46, 1:48, 1:57, 2:02, 2:08, 2:10, 2:29, 2:35, 2:38, 2:46, 3:00, 3:01, 3:04, 3:30, 3:35, 3:47, 3:58, 4:10. These rolls did nothing to get you away from the opponent, didn't really let you dodge a move, didn't let you land an attack/punish, or caused you to get punished.   Thrown out attacks: 0:25, 0:33, 0:34, 1:02, 1:04, 1:26, 1:38, 1:40, 2:20, 2:25, 2:28, 2:32, 3:16, 3:20, 3:24, 3:42, 3:55, 4:00, 4:05. You weren't always punished for it, but because they didn't hit or pressure the opponent, you could have spent the time better to form a set-up/pressure more effectively with tilts, aerials, and movement. You spent most of the time rolling, hence less time to perform attacks.              Imho, since Roy's techniques/BnBs weren't demonstrated in the video, I don't think you should pick up another character just yet. But it sounds like this tourney is a fun thing, so it's up to you how competitive you want to be. If you'll have more fun learning both Pitoo and Roy, then do so."
CrazyHand,3d8zfy,Eontios,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:16:49 2015 UTC,"I was gonna come in here and drop some knowledge bombs, but damn this detail tho.  Remember that simply being barely out of range is a better defensive option/position than rolling, dodging, or shielding, as there's no commitment, no lag, and leaves literally every option open.  EDIT: Try practicing your movement without actually attacking. Sometimes when I'm practicing, I like to take some time and just play a platformer. No dodges, no shields, just jumping and running; don't get hit. It'll improve your character control."

CrazyHand,3d74rv,Zenabie,15,Tue Jul 14 01:17:11 2015 UTC,"I will break down Dr. Mario's key characteristics and why this prevents him from moving up tiers, also please note I have little experience with him, but I will try my best to explain.   Lack of mobility, this hinders Doctor Mario from taking advantage of situations and squeezing out conversions. A bit off topic, but the reason why C. Falcon is highish tier is due to his great mobility and set ups he can create due to how fast he is. He is able to follow up and pressure the opponent which is why his dash grab is so fearsome. Dr. Mario on the other hand, has a difficult time creating pressure due to how his moves knock opponents farther than he is able to catch up with them, even then they aren't safe due to how easy it is to punish out of shield. Safe Way of Closing Out Stocks: Sheik has a great edge guarding kit, Little Mac has raw power, and ZSS has got those killer combos. Dr. Mario can't go deep for those edge guards due to how constrictive his recovery is, but he certainly does have the power to KO them. However, his smash attacks have some decent start up, making them read heavy, and if you miss you will definitely eat a punish in return.  In a game where everyone has stellar recoveries, having a terrible recovery only serves to hinder performance even more. While yes Little Mac has both terrible recoveries and aerial game, he has a god like ground based game, nothing offsets Dr. Mario's weaknesses, he is just kind of ""meh"" at everything.   Also don't take reddit's tier list too seriously, its more of a popularity poll of recent tournament winnings if anything."

CrazyHand,3d74rv,Kiviskus,5,Tue Jul 14 20:13:21 2015 UTC,"He is slower, so he has less mobility. Less mobility leads to less options overall. He does more damage, which leads to more knockback. Although each hit does more damage, he's getting less hits due to the knockback preventing follow ups or combos. This results in less damage being dealt over time. The best example to see this is up-tilt strings, where Mario can land many and follow them with U-airs, but Doc can't. His recovery is one of the worst in a game where most recoveries are incredible. This not only causes him to die earlier, but prevents him from going deep for an edgegaurd. At least Mario can go for an offstage spike F-air, but Doc can't even do that.   And as a side note, Pichu is not considered the worst character in Melee currently."
CrazyHand,3d74rv,HybridTheory1,2,Tue Jul 14 02:22:55 2015 UTC,"Oh, my mistake on the Pichu thing then... I always heard that ""PICHU IS THE WORST CHARACTER IN THE HISTORY OF EVERYTHING!!!"" and I didn't get any reason for that (didn't play Melee, mostly started playing at SSB4, but Brawl was my first Smash game) and all I heard was ""His special attacks harm him."". I guess that is a similar issue with Charizard, but Charizard is big and heavy, so a bit of damage wouldn't be TOO threatening, it would still be a problem, but he can handle it, he is heavy. Pichu (from what I hear) cannot handle this, mainly because he is the lightest character in SSBM. I see from my mistake for calling him the worst, but from what I heard he was pretty much the next best thing to Garbador in Smash Bros... get it? Because Garbador is... nvm..."
CrazyHand,3d74rv,Dapplegonger,4,Tue Jul 14 02:40:56 2015 UTC,"Pichu hurts himself whenever he uses an attack with an electric effect. But he has a chaingrab on the spacies (like many characters), a good nair and a good uair (despite Pikachu's being better) in the neutral, a decent projectile (even if it hurts himself), a pretty good recovery (even though it hurts himself), and a few good KO options. This in comparison to Kirby, who doesn't really have any good tools in the neutral, no projectiles, a terrible recovery, not really any good KO options, three throws that can be mashed out of during the throw, and one throw that actually combos into Rest (Jigglypuff can Rest Kirby out of his back throw).  Pichu is still really bad because of the light weight that means the damage he deals to himself gets him to an early KO percent even quicker, and his ""good moves in the neutral"" are only good in the sense that they are usable. And his KOs aren't really reliable either. His chaingrab would be really good on Fox/Falco if there was a way to actually get a grab.  But I will always maintain that he is better than Kirby, and I personally think he is also better than Bowser."

CrazyHand,3d74rv,Shats299,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:03:23 2015 UTC,"A) I would argue that 10 or fewer characters in Sm4sh are being developed well. Dr. mario is not one of them, and regular Mario is coming up for the first time ever through Ally. These characters are pretty much all high or top tier on the lists you see because they're developed. PLEASE do not take any list as gospel, or even close to it. We just saw a ganon with customs take games on a luigi in a regional tournament a few weeks ago in grand finals.  B) Unless you're in the top 15% of skill (and that's a hugely liberal amount, it's probably more like top <10%), tier lists really aren't going to matter for you at all. Tiers become relevant when fundamentals are being maxed between characters, and the strengths and weaknesses of the characters themselves gain a greater area to shine.   tl;dr Tiers are fun to talk about, but for most of us, they really don't matter."

CrazyHand,3d8c3c,KageTemplar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:44:57 2015 UTC,"If you plan on going to competive smash, anther's ladder is generally better, since you don't only have to play omega stages. FG 1v1 is okay, but generally lags since the distance of player will effect the connect. Anther ladder allows you to talk to opponents as well, and have a better connection since you can see who is close in your area and is online."
CrazyHand,3d7prc,McMilla1228,3,Tue Jul 14 04:07:41 2015 UTC,"There are two ways you can play against characters with large disjointed boxes with Mario.  Very aggressive or very laid back, this mainly comes from the fact that characters with large disjoints usually have a lot of lag on their aerials, and have to rely on walling you out with their giant sword.   Very aggressive - Mario has pretty good moves in his tool kit such as hit up tilt and up air being great juggling moves along with up smash being somewhat safe on shield. The idea here is that while Mario's range on his moves might not be as big as Ike and friends, they definitely come out faster. So if you play very aggressive they will have a hard time retaliating due to how laggy some of their moves are. Laid back, Mario's projectile is decently good as it can cover opponents who are grounded and those who short hop. You essentially want to bait them into committing to an aerial, so you can shield grab them and do some easy bake combos. Once their percentage is high enough, you can try fishing for some up smashes as it is decently safe on shield, and has healthy enough knock back.   If you have any questions, feel free to ask!"

CrazyHand,3d60yx,Upsidedownnightmares,2,Tue Jul 14 05:48:33 2015 UTC,"In higher level play then FG overuse can be a really bad thing. I like to think of a player who's really good at FG, knows what to do and what not to do, and all the mechanics of smash (but is not in local tourneys or anthers ladder yet) a 100% autopilot play. They dont think that much about it and just act on pure battle mode.  Dont get me wrong. This isnt a bad thing. Against lower leven players like on FG it works, it really does, especially if your autopilot is REALLY good. This could be where your pk fire use is coming in, its good spacing, and it works. But when the time comes to think about play and knowing that your playing and equally good or maybe even better player then you, you might get punished severely for using it often, be it accidental or not.  Just my 10 cents on the topic. Good luck!"

CrazyHand,3d60yx,T_Peg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:20:44 2015 UTC,"This is honestly a difficult question with no one correct answer. Spamming any attack is ""bad"" only in the sense that it makes you overly predictable and gives your opponent plenty of time to figure out how to punish it; simply put predictability loses games. At the same time though, if a situation calls for an attacks use, you shouldn't stop yourself from using it simply because you're afraid of exceeding some magical number of uses.  What it comes down to is that you should be using the attack when the situation is appropriate and safe. For example, if you can guarantee the hit without the possibility of being punished, or if you can simply throw it out without being punished (limits their approach options and makes your attack patterns less predictable)."
CrazyHand,3d66dp,Jgarlick7,4,Mon Jul 13 20:53:56 2015 UTC,"Tip #1:  Watch this - Nairo vs. Zero at CEO 2015  Tip #2:  Naw but for real dawg, go watch Tip #1.  There's a big take-away from Nairo's play style, and that's how Sheik can be pressured through movement.  Foxtrot in and see how she responds.  Short hop in and see how she responds.  Hold shield a few character lengths away and see how she responds.  Keep your movement up to make yourself harder to hit, and focus on watching her.  Sheik's recovery is just okay, and Zamus can easily trap her into some awful situations out of just a few grabs.  The key to the matchup is getting that first read which allows you to set up your combo - and the key to the first read is identifying a pattern which you can bait out.  Need some proof?  Watch the first 30 seconds of game 1 in the above set.  Nairo's opening combo is vicious - he gets something like 60% out of a shield-dropped u-air without blinking.  Not all of us can pull that off, but every one of us can approach with a falling aerial once or twice to condition the opponent into shielding when you jump.  Now watch the next thirty seconds:  All of a sudden, Nairo empty hops a few times, and Zero hides in shield because he's scared of the aerial combo taking an early stock.  Now the grabs start coming out, and Nairo looks like a champion as he shreks the best Sheik in the world and then promptly loses the set.  Don't get me wrong, Sheik is difficult to match up with regardless of character - it all boils down to good fundamentals and understanding of options.  Which, honestly, is a great way to skill-check yourself and see if there's anything that you need to work on.  I mean, I guess it wouldn't hurt to play a character with EZ-Bake Combos, crazy movement options, guaranteed kill setups, and solid recovery, but where would you find something like that?"

CrazyHand,3d50dg,GreatGateway,21,Mon Jul 13 16:00:06 2015 UTC,"Is only game!  Why you heff to be mad?  Kidding aside, let me start out with this:  good on you for sticking with competitive smash despite your condition.  I've seen a few of your posts recently that seem like you're getting a little discouraged by the way that people communicate online (which is generally a little nastier than in real life), and I wanted to say that the fact that you haven't quit entirely is victory enough already.  There are a lot of role models in the smash community who deal with disabilities (M2K comes to mind), and I'd like to think that the Smash community in general is friendly enough to not make your experience totally miserable.  That said, there's a little bit of a unique mindset in competitive gaming which differs from the mindset in non-competitive gaming.  When people play on For Glory or Anthers, the general goal is to win; this stands in contrast to For Fun, local casual multiplayer, single player, or other non-competitive games in general, in which the goal is to enjoy the game.  That means that people will do things they normally would not in order to ""tilt"" you, or put you into a mindset where you are no longer playing at your highest level.  This includes all of the things you've mentioned above.  To elaborate:   Taunting, crouch-walking, and (relatively safe) move-spamming are all in-game tactics often used to get an opponent to be overly-aggressive, particularly if the taunter has just closed out a stock and has the rage built up to punish the opponent for over committing at a low percentage.  Some people do it to be dicks, sure, but the effect is the same:  your anger forces you to make bad choices, allowing the taunter to win more easily. Name tagging after a match, switching to the opponent's character, and sharing disrespectful replays are all tactics which someone might use to continue winning against an opponent whom they have already tilted.  This is important for people who are obsessed with their FG win percentage/Anther's ranking.  If you can easily beat an opponent using psychological tactics once, it is advantageous to try to maintain their disrupted psychological state if you wish to beat them over and over again in order to improve your statistical measurements of success.   So what to do about all of the disrespect and mind-games?  First things first:  remember, it's all just a tactic.  These people don't hate you personally, they just want to maintain their competitive advantage.  The easiest way to circumvent getting mad is to understand that your opponent's end game is not to hurt your pride; they're trying to hurt your ability to play well.  This defeats the tactic entirely, because awareness of the situation will remove their power - at this point, you know what they're trying to do, and you can either choose to respond to it in kind or ignore it completely.  The trick for you will be finding a way to overcome the limits of your ASD, which, without any understanding of the circumstances of your life, probably makes it harder for you to ignore the psychological manipulations of your opponents.  Perhaps look into some cognition training to keep yourself abreast of the problem (e.g. constantly asking yourself ""am I playing on tilt?"" to help be aware of whether or not you're being manipulated).  This is going to take a lot of practice to master, but think of it like any other mechanical technique or play style which takes time to learn.  Remember, everyone struggles a little bit with establishing the proper competitive mindset to approach Smash.  Some people are naturally more histrionic, some people are very level-headed; some people need to actively engage their brain in making every twitch movement and decision, while others succeed only when they can stop thinking so much and just play.  You may not be ""average"" like you mentioned in your post, but you're just like everyone else when it comes to the importance of establishing a frame of mind before, during, and after competitive gaming.  EDIT:  Can someone who is better at reddit than I am explain why the second bullet in my list is showing up as white text?  Thanks!"

It's a sad reality of the outside world:  give someone anonymity and a platform, and they'll turn into a garbage-spewing scumbag.  Here's the thing, though:  if you just go play with someone else whenever you encounter a player that does something like that, you take back all of the control in the situation.  Now they have to go find someone else to harass, you can write down their NNID and report them (seriously, link the replay as evidence and see if Nintendo doesn't immediately ban them), and you never have to see that player again.  If you really want to get under their skin, grit your teeth and enter a ""GG"" in your tag line before you head out.  A bully derives no pleasure when they don't earn a negative response.  A bully becomes infuriated if it appears that his/her actions have not even fazed the target.  In all seriousness, the beauty of online gaming is the expansiveness of the community.  You can play with just about anyone, at any time.  I promise that there are polite, respectful players out there who don't do any of the things you mentioned in your original post.  Don't feel defeated if you have to leave a match because the other person is awful; it's not rage-quitting, it's removing yourself from the presence of a childish troll.  Just a final note, I really want to emphasize that the option to report someone is incredibly, incredibly essential to counteracting online bullying.

Robin fares well against larger characters (bigger targets), those who don't have any projectiles at all (keep them at bay or set traps) and those with disjointed hitboxes (his are the most disjointed of all!). However, fast characters (close the gap faster than we can charge stuff), small characters (glares at Jigglypuff) and those who can reflect/use projectiles of their own give him trouble.

Master the float.  It's easily the most important part of the character.  Practice ground floating out of shield, run, and into attacks.   Be smart with your turnips.  I see too many Peach players that rely too heavily on turnips in the neutral.  While it's an amazing projectile, you can't spam them without thinking.  It has rather bad starting lag where you can easily be attacked when pulling one out.  Only pull one out if you're sure you can't be punished. Edgeguard aggressively.  Peach has some of the best aerials in the game.  Fair in particular is extremely strong and you'll score most of your KOs with it.  Some things you should do include: turnip to fair (guaranteed combo, just don't be predicable with it), float near ledge and nair or bair, and turnip gimping. Bread and butter combos.  Of course, like any good fighter, Peach has some easy ways to deal out damage.  Down throw to f-tilt at low %, and use bairs at medium %.  Dair combos into fair, bair, nair, and up b.  Convert turnips into grabs or dash-attacks.  Killing.  Peach's killing options are good, but not the best.  Most of your kills will be from fair because of its sheer power.  Your f-smash has 3 variations; when your opponent is at kill %, always have the pan ready (it deals very strong vertical knockback).  Up smash is extremely powerful when sweetspotted, aim to hit where her body is or the tip of her hand.  At very high percent (150% or less with rage) back throw on the ledge will kill."

You'll die a lot but you'll break the rolling habit because you'll learn other ways to avoid attacks and space properly, which is everything except rolling really. Then once you've stopped rolling you can start using shields again. And any time you find yourself starting to spam rolls again by accident, just rinse and repeat."

CrazyHand,3d6lxk,SuperMikey64,2,Tue Jul 14 00:11:18 2015 UTC,"Yes. And before you do that, you're gonna need to jump. You just have to. The cyclone will keep the momentum of the jump, so if you really want any height out of it, you gotta do it. Also you don't need to time side b. Just keep doing it until you're next to the stage, then when down b gets you up high enough, use up b low enough to not get hit by a dash attack, but high enough to grab the ledge."

CrazyHand,3d3oee,Poyoarya,6,Mon Jul 13 07:08:28 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm no Pikachu main, but here's some general things I noticed from watching the Captain Falcon and Diddy fights once each. The Falcon fight looked really lazy, but you may have just been very passive on account of the early suicide. But you should never give up, especially with a character like Pikachu. Keep an offensive mind set and don't get fazed when you make mistakes.  Your recoveries were pretty dangerous a lot of the time. Side-b's to the middle of the stage, up-b's missing the ledge resulting in one death in each of the matches, up-b's ending high above ground. You should definitely work on recovering to safer locations, and practice hitting that ledge with the up-b. I'm a Rosa main, and even though I feel like I've mastered all the up-b trajectories, I still make it a point to practice it in training every now and then to stay sharp. I'd say characters with up-b's like Rosa, Pikachu and Ness are deserving some special attention.  You often didn't follow up with your throws or try to hit your opponents when they were airborne. However, you looked a lot more aggressive early in your stocks in the Diddy fight. Do that more.  When you grabbed opponents, I'm pretty sure I didn't see you do a single pummel. Should get in the habit of racking up that extra damage when you can."
CrazyHand,3d3oee,superbadsoul,3,Mon Jul 13 08:17:51 2015 UTC,"/u/superbadsoul made some really great points and you should definitely work on those, but to add a little bit on that, here's some things I've noticed as well (I play Pikachu sometimes):  I like how you played safe and stayed just outside your opponent's range, waiting for a good opportunity to deal damage, but you should really optimise your punishes more. Pikachu has really great damage-dealing combos out of utilt and dthrow, but I rarely saw you capitalising on your opponent's whiffs beyond a single hit. Really try to squeeze in as much damage as you can off a punish without overextending.  Practice recovering off the stage from all angles (high, mid and low) and as much as possible, use side B sparingly. You tend to recover high and land on stage with Skull Bash (which has a whopping 44 recovery frames), putting you in a prime position to get punished. Your control with Up B also needs work, as you SD'ed with it a few times. Try to aim for the ledge when using it off stage, it's such a good recovery because of the different ways you can mix up your recovery with it."
CrazyHand,3d3oee,jaylowww,2,Mon Jul 13 10:21:31 2015 UTC,"Pika main here.  Main thing I noticed was how laxed and defensively you played.  One thing to note while playing pikachu is to never stop moving.  Apply constant pressure with tjolts and just by being in the opponents face.  Learn the dthrow->uair->nair combo and the fthrow->dash attacks/upsmash.    Also, you were just letting the captain falcon get back onstage while you were just standing there.  Pikachu's is probably the best edgeguarder in the game, so anytime you get someone offstage you need to go deep to get the kill.  Either do a fast falling bair, jumping over to them fair, or try to nair them if you want to be safe and possibly get the stage spike.  Eventually they will go high to avoid your edgeguards, so do a wavebounce thunder (which is essentially a b-reverse) off the stage to cover all vertical options.   Another thing is that you were really fishing for those smash attacks.  You should almost never use smash attacks with pika until they're in kill range.  Dsmash is incredibly laggy and punishes rolls decently well, but you should punish rolls more with utilt, as it's faster and leads to great combos.  Another mixup kill option (that usually only works once as they'll be more careful the second time) is fastfall fair to upsmash.  They'll usually be in hitstun when you land, and fair has basically no endlag, so if they don't shield, you can immediately upsmash out of it.   Also, work on shorthop dairs.  It safe on shield, trips at low percents, and autocancels.  And I saw at around 1:10 you started to do some kinda nice things with quick attacks.  Those were good, but get more consistent with it.  You killed yourself once, but you tried to combo quick attack into utilt once.  Do that a lot.  Pika's Up-B is by far the best in the game, so use it.  Use it to close gaps on running opponents, start combos, mix-up your ground game, etc.  It's uses are endless. Just go in training mode and practice around with it for 30 mins or so (I know it's hella boring but it's so so worth it trust me).  Also work on QAC (quick attack cancelling).  It's basically where if you quick attack onto a ledge, you will slide off, and you can do anything out of it.  Go on battlefield and just quick attack everywhere and see what angles you can find that it works at.    Wow I just realized how much I wrote.  So basically do these things and you should get better.  TL:DR - learn to quick attack and be aggresive"
CrazyHand,3d3oee,Sir_Upvote,2,Mon Jul 13 14:12:16 2015 UTC,"Ok, so elephant in the room, you are relying entirely too much on rolling and it's severely limiting your offensive options. There were a number of times where if you'd have dropped shield and dashed left rather than rolling back you could have easily landed a free grab. Also notice in the Diddy game, whenever you see him start spamming down smash, it's because he knows at that distance you are going to roll towards him rather than approaching in any other method; simply put it's overly predictable.  My suggesting for you is to play for a few weeks with shield removed from your control, and in that time to explore moving with your character. It's going to feel incredibly awkward at first but eventually you'll be more comfortable without it and you'll start finding it easier to make use of Pikachu's tools. The only reason I specifically focus on rolling is that I saw you choose a lot of great options, so it's apparent that you have put in a good deal of time with the character, but your movement seems to be the biggest hurdle holding you back."
CrazyHand,3d3oee,ShiningRarity,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:29:13 2015 UTC,I'll  try doing that! Thanks for the advice.
CrazyHand,3d3oee,adavey29,2,Mon Jul 13 22:15:35 2015 UTC,"First things first, I don't think Pikachu is really the best character for (no offense) less skilled players. Pika has an extremely expansive combo game and is great in neutral but you don't really seem to be able to use them very well at all. That's fine that you aren't skilled enough to play pika to his full potential, (Most people aren't, pika is one of the hardest characters in the game to play imo) but you might find much better results if you started out with a simpler character. Someone like Falcon or Shiek may be better for you if you like speed, but honestly your playstyle seems more defensive then anything so perhaps someone like Ganon may be better-suited for you.  Your neutral game seems to be entirely consisting of throwing out random moves and hoping your opponents walk into them. That may have some effectiveness on For Glory where it's really laggy usually but on Anther's Ladder where you generally have better connections and especially offline where there's no latency at all the strategy is a lot less effective since you have more time to react to your opponent charging up a move. You need to work on really thinking about using the right move for the situation rather then just throwing out random moves in the general direction of where your opponent is.   Sorry I ran out of time typing this, there was more I wanted to say but there already was a lot said by others. Good luck."
CrazyHand,3d3oee,TheNachoNazis,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:31:12 2015 UTC,"So the good news is that to improve you don't have to worry about anything as abstract or as hard to pin down as ""playstyle"". You have the most common problems in the world when it comes to smash. And those is poor control of your characters movement and a poor understanding of your opponent's characters options.   You need to use quick attack and t-jolt more in neutral. Watch some ESAM videos slowed down on youtube. Learn to short hop consistently, fox trot, and the mechanics of dashing vs running. Learn the spacing and timings of all your moves and read the Pika boards on smashboards to figure out their uses.   Learn about shield mechanics in smash 4, they dictate so much of how matches play out. Topics include shield grabbing (see JTails video on yourtube), shield stun, shield push-back, jump cancelling shield, individual characters good OOS options.  Practice getting back to ledge and your QA angles. Jump off the side a lot in training mode, try and edgegaurd cpus or practice partners. Think matchup by matchup, and most importantly PLAY DELIBERATELY. You'll never be able to pick out and fix your own mistakes unless you start pressing buttons with a reason in your head for doing so."

CrazyHand,3d2wln,Keyblade_Kid,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:06:19 2015 UTC,"With Wii Fit, here's a few things I've learned:   Keeping a Sun Salutation charged as often as you can is also a great idea. I like it for reading rolls or punishes, and you can guarantee a full charge at the beginning of a match by jumping off the side and immediately charging, then use your second jump and mash Up-B to recover, use a Side-B (Header) to help cover yourself if they're anticipating your recovery. Sun Salutation can kill at higher percents and adds a lot of damage if you can do it right, just be weary of reflectors!  Her jab hits on both sides, use this to your advantage to catch people off guard.  Her aerials are all really good, but they take practice to get used to their timing. Bairs are where you get the most kill potential from, but not until high percents. Up-airs are easy to string together if you get the timing right, and her dair is kinda hard to use like Ness', but it does spike if you get it right. Bury (third jab) to d-tilt I think is a true combo past ~50% or so, but don't quote me on that.  Use d-tilt and d-smash more often on smaller characters like Kirby or Ness.  Down Smash and f-tilt have a lot of horizontal knockback as well, so if you happen to land it, use your awesome recovery abilities to go for some fairs or bairs if you can after one.   Hope that comes in handy some as far as general tips. Wii Fit is absolutely one of my favorites, even though I'm terrible at committing to a main since I'm easily distracted by other characters, I at least feel like I can somehow win more often than lose with her. Also, I have a tip that's somehow completely invisible and I have no damn idea why, so highlight my post to get the last one."
CrazyHand,3d2bvu,Riah8426,4,Sun Jul 12 23:26:08 2015 UTC,"You need to put more space between you and your opponent, work on your sh pk fire, and trade dair for nair when you land. Go watch AceStarThe3rd's Lucas undefeatable series on YouTube, you can grab some good advices from his playstyle."
CrazyHand,3d2bvu,PommePatate,2,Sun Jul 12 23:36:03 2015 UTC,"This, I felt like you were passively spacing rather than aggressively spacing your opponent. I've personally found that his playstyle is a bit changed due to the less floaty physics of the game. I'm having a hard time landing d-air any more, so I usually fall and use my uair, nair, or PK Fire to land safely.   Definitely use your Zair more, it has an incredible reach (and a hitbox!) and can be used to combo some people unexpectedly. Just as an example, sometimes what I'll do is shorthop, Zair, dash attack and then grab, dthrow and combo that into a Nair. You can bait a combo like that by rushing in, and then if they charge a smash attack (or you can read one), Zair to get a jab to stop it, then go in for combos. The neutral triple jab is also pretty helpful to space after you've been stunned/hit since it hits out relatively fast."
CrazyHand,3d2bvu,shinyquagsire23,2,Mon Jul 13 04:34:16 2015 UTC,"That's honestly the second thing I try to improve the most on (first is Zair spacing for combos), but the lag on FG makes it very difficult to do online because I land when short hopping, causing me to get punished. I can do it fine on training mode though.  I will check out the series as well."
CrazyHand,3d2bvu,kenny9292,3,Mon Jul 13 09:47:08 2015 UTC,"You're not bad you definitely have a grasp on his moves, and what they can do. You should definitely use PK Fire more. It's a good move for spacing, which is something that I feel Lucas' entire moveset is based on (multiple moves with sweet spots). Also his Zair is useful for this as well. If you're close enough and you hit them with Zair, there are some follow ups you can do.   However, I feel that you sometimes do a lot, and get nothing out of it. Like in the match with Zelda, you jumped and moved a lot, but you didn't gain anything. Sure, nothing was lost, but it's better to not move around just for the hell of it.   Nair is really good. Use that more. And once you get really comfortable with Lucas, you'll be a le to combo off of reaction, and his moves combo very well with one another, which leads to my next point.   You have to mix up with him. Like, it's damn near needed to mix up your moves wth Lucas, since the main style of play with him (the one you used) can VERY easily be adapted to. I play him too, and I was able to predict what moves you'd pick somewhat easily. That's the absolute last thing you want to happen. Bowser Jr. is also in the same boat, as well as a few other characters. It's almost criminal how easy it is to adapt to Lucas' main ""flow chart"", as opposed to someone like Sheik, Ness, or Rosalina (but then again, they're not top tiers without a good reason).  Jab saves lives. It's frame 2 I'm pretty sure, if not, then frame 3, which means it beats out almost every other attacking option in the game when up close. Learn to love the jab.   Although Lucas doesn't have a Dsmash that covers rolls, he has two moves that cover spot dodges. His Dsmash is, if I'm not mistaken, impossible to spot dodge. In higher level play, or against a good opponent, this will come in very handy. Or if you're feeling ballsy, Usmash can punish a spot dodge too. Or you could spam Dtilt, or Jab.  Whatever you want, really.   Sadly, Lucas can't really deal with pressure too well, which is why he isn't (at least how I see it) too high on the tier list, so you struggling with aggressive characters is bound to happen.   Projectile spammers shouldn't be too much of an issue if you can power shield. But good luck wth that on FG. I'm sure you're aware thay his Fsmash reflects, and he has the PSI Magnet. So someone with projectiles shouldn't be too much of a problem.   You have a tether. You don't always have to use your Up B.   Don't get grab happy. Honestly, don't rely on his grab too much. Not saying don't use it, but if they're close enough to grab, you might just want to juggle them with an Utilt, which combos into itself.   A good mix up I like is out of Dthrow. Don't always Nair. You can do Usmash, Dsmash, Utilt, Uair, Fair, and even PK Freeze out of it.   Learn how to sweet spot his attacks too. You'll need to be able to do that for certain combos, or kills.   Don't Dair too much. The end lag is too great, and unless you get the spike (both on and off stage), it's almost worthless.   Jab Jab Dsmash works sometimes. Maybe it's just because of FG lag, but I've gotten it to work more times than I thought possible. Dtilt can also combo start, since it's so fast.   Lucas is somewhat wierd. He had a great combo game but getting in is a problem. And someone else getting in on him is also a problem as well. So what you ultimately want to do is play keep away until you find an opening to get in. Then you stay in as long as you can, and rinse and repeat.   A lot of info, I know. Sorry about that. Just ask if you have more questions.   Red shirt and Duster alt are best alts."
CrazyHand,3d2bvu,kenny9292,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:03:56 2015 UTC,"No worries about walls of text! The more the merrier for me!  Apologies for my wall of stupid questions and replies in advance though.  The more I play Lucas, the more I do seem to understand that he has a ""keep away"" spacing style as well. I'm trying to get used to it, but I do mainly play a hyperly aggresive Kirby with good results.  Spacing is actually my #1 priority to better utilize it in the neutral. Most of my empty hops, and jumping about is from my Kirby playstyle in neutral, apologies. I tend to do that and space with SH F-air to bait a reaction or if they shield, and SH Nair-ing if the roll in. The lag in FG makes it a bit difficult to use SH PK Fires properly, as I always get the landing cancel with it, and punished. Zair is a bit tricky to understand as well (even though it has great combo potential and a kill option), but my opponents just seem to shield and attack.  I also try to use grabs when they whiff a laggy attack, but they always seem to have time to prevent it afterwards. I guess I do use grab too much, but isnt his down throw the main way to mix up? I mostly try to U-air or B-air out of it.  Speaking of which, mixing up is probably my biggest problem of all. It's kind of confusing because it seems every option I consider will be too obvious, or too punishable. How would I mixup properly without being predictable?  I honestly thought I was using Nair a decent amount. Not sure exactly when to use it aside from combo-ing (along with tilts and U/D-Smash, those never land for me when I make a read).  I've been using the Red shirt Lucas since Brawl btw :)"
CrazyHand,3d1fc7,GiggleAtTheGoatse,3,Sun Jul 12 19:00:00 2015 UTC,"I haven't played many duck hunt dogs on a high level, but a general idea against projectile based characters like dhd and toon link is to get in close. Make them unable to set up on you. Duck hunt doesn't have many ways to deal with this, and his recovery lacks a hurtbox. This means you will want to get him offstage ASAP. Also, don't forget you can jump out of shield to avoid getting grabbed. As falcon, use your offstage game to limit his time to set up and camp you out."
CrazyHand,3d1fc7,jllmprrt,2,Sun Jul 12 22:12:40 2015 UTC,"For getting in on zoners in general(not just in smash, also other fighting games) you just need to be patient and find an opening. You can neutral jump/powershield the projectiles and move forward until you're close enough to play a more fair neutral game. Thankfully in smash you have MUCH more movement freedom than in street fighter with the free falling double jumps, dashes, running, being able to face wherever you want, rolling, etc. Find his patterns of attacks and punish them. If he's punishing your sheild with grabs it means you're probably too close to be blocking the clay bird or wild gunman. You can mix up your defensive game by spot dodging, jumping, and even rolling forward and backwards. Since you're playing as Falcon you can really capitalize off your punishes, so make sure to make them count.  I know this advice is pretty general, but without a video we can't see what you're doing wrong."
CrazyHand,3d1fc7,RamRamStyles,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:31:46 2015 UTC,"As a preface to all this, this is both specific help for this problem and general help for the long term.   I played against a pretty decent DHD on Anther's for the first time and immediately had the same problem (as I wasn't used to the mu).  I figured that DHD wants me to stick in shield for a grab, so that was out of the question.  So with that and only a few percent on me, I decided that it's only a ladder match, so why not experiment and learn.  I play Sheik so I used fair, which I found out beats all projectiles (you have to hit the gunner and the can requires some careful spacing and precision).   With projectiles less effective, DHD becomes pretty trash, so I won pretty easily.   Obviously, what to take away from this is ""discover what moves from your toolset will cancel /beat the projectiles""  and that's great, but let's take a step back.   Incorporating this into your play is all good and fine,  but at the end of the day you need to learn how to read / adapt even in these tough, grim situations.  Take a deep breath and ask ""What's making me not get in?""  Then,  ""What I'm I doing?  How is it being punished?""  And finally,  ""What else is at my disposal so that I can do things differently?"" It's a skill of persistence and it's certainly easier to throw in the towel, but if you do get the reads and download your opponent,  you're one step closer to forcing your opponents to ask questions on here due to one of your matches with them."

CrazyHand,3d0kwr,Fawful,2,Sun Jul 12 14:30:32 2015 UTC,"Meta Knight has a strong MU against Luigi. His light weight keeps him from being throw murdered, his fast pace and reactionary punish Capes can punish Luigis horrific traction and endlag extremely hard. Additionally, Luigis airspeed makes him an treat. A nice, tasty, 4 ladder up b off the top at 40% treat.  Fireballs are ignored by Mach Tornado, and he's easily gimpable, one of Meta Knights specialties.  He's a weak brother. He has no ability to stand against the true Beyblade."
CrazyHand,3d0kwr,TalkingFrenchFry,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:28:56 2015 UTC,The only issue with meta knight is he lacks range.   The only moves he has to break past luigi's fireballs are Mach tornado and the side b.   Both of these moves are easy illy punishable if whiffed.     This matchup becomes a game of footies.  Luigi tries to keep meta knight at bay and meta knight looks for an opening on luigi.
CrazyHand,3d0kwr,Fawful,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:08:37 2015 UTC,"Don't forget. The other option for fireballs is going into the air, and MK has impressive disjoints on his aerials. Luigi cannot combat his aerial game."
CrazyHand,3d0kwr,TalkingFrenchFry,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:24:31 2015 UTC,The thing is that luigi's aerial have amazing priority as well.  And being above luigi is a bad idea.  One tornado from luigi and your dead at 90%.  It's definitely an interesting match up since both characters feed of punishes
CrazyHand,3d0kwr,Fawful,2,Sat Jul 18 14:54:21 2015 UTC,"In a way, the characters are nearly the same. I would actually say it's almost a pure 50:50 matchup."
CrazyHand,3d0kwr,KickToTheUterus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:59:17 2015 UTC,I'd actually put it at 60:40 meta knight only because meta can trash luigi if he gets him off stage

CrazyHand,3d044f,rhcp2011,6,Sun Jul 12 10:32:03 2015 UTC,"Mario is most vanurable when he's off the stage. He can't stall very long even with his Cape. His Up B has a wide hit box yes, but you should practice carrying him below the stage in hopes of gimping him.   As Fox your Reflector is your best friend. He can't grab you, which is Mario's main source of fighting. And he can't approach with Fireballs which also set up for grabs.  Try to work on mixing up Short Hops and Nair and Reflecting him and Dash Attacks. Fox's Dash attack is pretty decent but don't do it to often because its easy to shield grab you and Punish.  Also use Lasers if you have space in between Mario. Mario struggles with getting in. Even with his cape you can shoot out like 5 lasers or so and get some damage in. This will also bait him into either going for a grab, which you can punish. Or Fireball. Which you can Punish.  Honestly if you get your Reflector timing down Mario can't really do anything to you."

CrazyHand,3d044f,TheBlackLuffy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:58:14 2015 UTC,"Use that down b against mario offstage. If you've ever watched Boss play, often he'll mash down b just enough so they fall out before the final hit, leading to an early gimp on a lot of characters. Also mario is a mid weight character, so he will get that 40% off a grab luigi is searching for. Be careful not to use the double jump too early offstage, because mario is the forward air monster lol. I'm not sure if the down b has more priority than the forward air but don't try to challenge it"
CrazyHand,3d1h53,Qcumber01,2,Sun Jul 12 19:14:45 2015 UTC,"It's really up to chance which one you get, but it's based on your position when you land on the ground. One happens when your character falls onto their back, the other when they fall on their face. The trip one obviously happens when you trip. Bowser Jr's are probably easier to notice the difference because his attacks use different gadgets, rather than slightly different attacks like other characters."
CrazyHand,3d0vr1,ThunderFenixBR,3,Sun Jul 12 16:15:01 2015 UTC,"Pikachu should destroy this match up.   Thunder jolts halt Falcon's approach.   Down throw combos into up tilt or up air (depending on percent), up tilts combo into up tilts and eventually into up airs (an easy 40-50% combo!).   Short hop forward air makes for an easy approach option (don't land directly in front of him!).  Mix up your recovery (up B) to avoid the Falcon down air.  Be sure to edge guard Falcon's predictable recovery. Edge guarding is Pikachu's main tool for kills."
CrazyHand,3d0vr1,ExtremeMagneticPower,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:36:52 2015 UTC,"Since Falcons main approach is dash attack/dash grab, you can halt his momentum with thunder jolts."

CrazyHand,3d0lgp,Maze715,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:55:53 2015 UTC,When you are charging a smash attack you take like 20 or 25% more knockback than usual. That's why the raptor boost killed you so early.
CrazyHand,3cywbj,Jeff-H_Art,3,Sun Jul 12 01:09:20 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised to see no mention of grounded bowser bombs. opponents that can recover well and in general avoid most of my attempts to close out a stock usually end up falling for the surprise grounded bowser bomb. The little headbutt he does on startup pops enemies up into the air for the drop(Have yet to see anyone escape after eating the first hit). If they powershield they're likely going to attempt a shield grab, in which case you're immediately up in the air, they're in endlag, rip. Finally there's the case where they panic after shielding the first hit and then try to continue shielding which results in a shield break.  Also worth expanding on Dtilt. since it is a quick multihit move, it works great for spacing on the ground and is much safer than Ftilt on shield."
CrazyHand,3cywbj,psychoteletubby7,2,Sun Jul 12 03:02:04 2015 UTC,"Is it possible to be an aggressive Bowser? I love playing as the awesome guy, and I'm surprised I'm having some success as him (could be the time of day when it comes to FG players) but I find unless I just react to attacks, I can never take the initiative."
CrazyHand,3cywbj,GreatGateway,3,Sun Jul 12 12:45:30 2015 UTC,"Yes! Although Bowser is better as a defensive character, he most definitely can go on the offense, especially if you're mixing it up.   I like to start with jumping firebreath, because no one ever suspects it, and it's very safe. Even if they shield it, the firebreath will push them back enough to the point where it's back into a safe neutral game.   I then proceed with combinations of Fair, Dair, Grab, Dash attack, but mostly Jab.   An aggressive Bowser is SCARY. He's big but he can do some major damage and one good hit can kill you. None of his hits are pussy hits... they always do at least 10% damage, usually around 15%. It makes the opponents go on the defensive side... which unfortunately isn't always the best for him, so in that scenario it'd be good to let the opponent get on the offensive.   You can also put false pressure. Go in as if you're attacking but then react to their messed up reaction. But that's a bit more advanced and can be hard to do against aggressive players."
CrazyHand,3cywbj,tom641,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:45:12 2015 UTC,"Good advice, so many people don't think of the occasional super low to the ground dair, and it's so good. Dair can also be occasionally useful for someone trying to land on stage, if you jump up to them and dair, they'll probably airdodge, expecting a fair. Then you jerk up and slam down on them for a potential kill. His Dair is actually a spike but it's nearly impossible to actually spike someone into a pit without going down yourself unless you get them just right at the edge. His Dair also slightly penetrates thin platforms, which can be useful on stages like Battlefield and Halberd. Also don't underestimate the usefulness of mixing a rogue Bowser Bomb in once in a while, especially if they start shielding/dodging your Dairs. It comes out slightly slower which messes up thier timing and can break shields unless it's powershielded, which means a free stock most of the time.  Also I wasn't aware you could angle the firebreath, you learn something new every day."

CrazyHand,3czutt,Shabacka,2,Sun Jul 12 07:47:31 2015 UTC,"The options from the ledge are: standard get up, get up attack, get up roll, get up jump, drop jump aerial onto the stage. In Falco's case, he can also drop jump side-B.  There is no one best option because the best option is to mix it up. (Although, get up attack is usually a bad choice.) Do something different almost every time. The way you get punished is if you get predictable; for example if you roll onto the stage every time your opponent simply charges a smash the other way."
CrazyHand,3czutt,SoulRed12,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:27:21 2015 UTC,"My problem is that he waits for me to start the get up, then does a safe punish. Usually he can't get a read on me, but because I play pretty defensive I tend to be on or near the ledge a lot. I probably utilize jumping from ledge more, but I was hoping to get an option that is safe on shield. Any ideas?"
CrazyHand,3czutt,SquidLoaf,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:36:03 2015 UTC,"Nothing is safe on shield except a grab. If he's shielding and punishing a lot, try a standard get up to a grab. But like everyone is saying, mix it up. I rent to like the drop down jump to aerial attack option. But you just have to space it well."
CrazyHand,3czutt,loginsinker,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:31:23 2015 UTC,"This actually isn't too specific.  I'm no pro, but I know what you're talking about, and I've found myself in the same spot many times before.  Good players know how to cover your get up options, but they aren't psychics.  They can only do this if they have a read on your get up choice.  The best advice I can give regarding this is to mix it up.  If you do something different every time, you're much more likely to not be punished.  As a rule of thumb, if someone punishes you for a get up attempt (say standard get up for example), then do a different one next time (like a roll or jump).  Sometimes they may just guess your option and be correct, and that's just bad luck if that happens.  An example of this is that some times I will full hop and back air when I see my opponent starting to get up, as many players I've seen at lower levels seem to think jumping from the ledge is un-punishable (which it usually is unless you read it).  In relation to this, sometimes a certain option may not be a good idea depending on your opponent's position, so this should influence the decision you make to some extent.  Examples:  If the opponent has positioned himself somewhat away from the ledge, don't roll, as he may be trying to Fsmash you.  If you see your opponent standing right next to the ledge, don't standard get up or get up attack, as they are likely looking to grab you.  All in all, just stay unpredictable and try not to let thim figure out your pattern.  Hope this helped.  Good luck!"
CrazyHand,3czutt,TheBlackLuffy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:26:11 2015 UTC,"Well with the characters you listed. Its best to just free fall for a moment. Then when you get close to the edge. Jump, THEN Up B.  This goes for anyone who has a vertical or vertical ish recovery.  People say Falco's recovery is ""bad"" but honestly its decent if you use it right?"
CrazyHand,3czutt,mindivy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:50:36 2015 UTC,"My problem is that once I grab the ledge, I have trouble getting up without getting punished. He likes to shield my attempt to get up then punish. He plays DDD, so if that makes a difference..."
CrazyHand,3czutt,mindivy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:41:07 2015 UTC,"Falco main here. His recoveries are predictable, and your friend is good at edge guarding. You have a good training partner.  How many ways can you recover? You can horizontally recover with firebird or phantasm, both will put you on stage, but endlag is an eternity. You can vertically recover with firebird. You can drop from the ledge and jump on it with a Nair or fair or phantasm (risky), or drop jump, fire a few lasers (for mixup), ledgegrab then getup. You can walljump instead of grabbing the ledge (if you do it just right, the walljump input will override the ledge grab), then phantasm or aerial back onto stage. I like this option because it keeps Falco mobile, which is kind of the challenge of playing with him.    But there is no default option.  Just experiment and practice and constantly mix it up."
CrazyHand,3czb2j,psychoteletubby7,2,Sun Jul 12 03:39:14 2015 UTC,"At the moment, there's only two DDD-specific techs I use in my game. If you know these already, my b. One is shff upair resetting. If you catch someone with a sh upair, you can fastfall onto the ground before the last hit and follow up, sort of like Fox's ff-fair combos. You can even ""chaingrab"" opponents at low percents. If your opponent mashes jump, it's possible for them to escape during your landing animation, so be sure to mix it up. The other is gordo sticking, which can be done reliably by sh'ing off the ledge and lobbing a up-gordo towards the stage. This can be useful as it limits their recovery options for a few seconds. Of couse, be sure to mixup your edgeguards so your oppnent doesn't predict it and just go in and spike you.

Also, sorry for not replying earlier, my internet died. :P"
CrazyHand,3czb2j,Shabacka,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:30:51 2015 UTC,"No I've seen how it helps. The other day I fought a luigi on FG that knew how to Hip Check. It actually did help him set up to punish me. It gave him an option that he wouldn't otherwise have. Compared to previous smash games? Sure techs don't seem to be as important, but they're still important to learn if you want to improve. If the currently known techs are useless for DDD, then that would be a different story."
CrazyHand,3czb2j,8drawr,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:51:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess they can be good in the right situations, but knowing your fundamentals is much more important. One you have the fundamentals down, then you move on to advanced techs and stuff. However, most people who play the game right now don't have the fundamentals down, so they need to practice those first. If you have the fundamentals down, then go for techs. Otherwise, I would say don't bother."
CrazyHand,3czq4u,5tardustflare,3,Sun Jul 12 06:36:23 2015 UTC,"With Pit, you want lots of grab-->d-throw combos. Follow up with dash to up smash at first and then up airs. Catch opponents trying to jump a bit over you with up smash. Catch opponents trying to air dodge through an up smash with a side smash. Follow people offstage, or shoot arrows if the character is hard (e.g. DDD) or dangerous (e.g. Ganon, Ness) to gimp. Side B, forward throw from ledge, or forward smash to kill. Don't decay your forward through when you might need it soon. After down throw stops giving you easy combos, up throw and follow up with arrow.  That's all I can think of offhand, good luck!

This means she has a guaranteed fair follow up, usually only one after low percents. It does decent damage but it won't kill you until grossly high percents.

CrazyHand,3cyz2a,BlankTrack,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:14:31 2015 UTC,"Jab is insanely good. Learn to do the first hit of the jab sequence over and over if they are above ~40%. You can usually throw in at least 3 and mix up into either another grab or a smash.  Tilts are all slow but they are good. Except down tilt. It might be a few frames faster, but foward tilt does the same thing with better hitboxes.  Foward air is really good. Really really good. Use it a lot. Use back air to out prioritize them.  Up smash kills early. Does more damage at the base of the pillar, but if they are close to the top of the beam, they are closer to the blast zone. Can be used to hit people as they grab the ledge if they don't sweetspot. Foward smash kills early. Downsmash would kill early as well, but it sends the target diagonally, so it doesn't kill until higher %  Any of your attacks that use the shield, Bair, Dash attack, neutralize enemy attacks instead of trading. Dash attack is really good, but is very punishable if bloked.  Insane grab range. So much range it doesn't even make sense. 90% of the time go for D Throw. At low percents you can follow up with either Fair Nair. D Throw into Uair kills very early, but most characters can DI out of it. If they DI or airdoge before you can meet them, wait for them on the ground and run foward Up Smash. Back throw at the edge kills at high % 130-160. Having rage helps.  Counter is slow and has weak knockback and damage. Use sparingly.  Up B is great. https://youtu.be/3jKf28n8t7Q?t=38  Neutral B- weird move. Has its uses. Because it is delayed it only really works if they stay at the same angle from you OR they will be back at the same angle by the time the bullets reach them. Good against frequent short hoppers. Something I like to do at the start of the match, is to jump, fastfall, and immediately cast B. This way you shoot as you are falling and you cover more space. As you land shoot another if they got hit or blocked it. THEN, run foward and grab/dash attack. They are usually expecting more projectile spam, and they aren't ready for close combat.

CrazyHand,3cyz2a,Anomalous13,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:28:12 2015 UTC,Play customs. Your down special should be lightweight. When you get the opponent to 80ish% get them in the air some how either a grab or up smash use lightweight and Jump up and use your up air.
CrazyHand,3cxtq3,hyperAware23,3,Sat Jul 11 19:15:33 2015 UTC,"I recently answered a question with someone who had a similar problem, and if you don't mind I will copy & paste the answer, but feel free to ask questions pertaining to anything.  This isn't really a wall that you just hit, but rather a really steep slope. This can be really frustrating sometimes because you feel that nothing you do is working, but I got some tips that can help you get things moving along.   Lab it up, the more you know about your character the more options that will be available to you which can be the deciding factor in a game. Find a use for EVERY move in your arsenal, no matter how useless it seems everything has a use. For example, nobody uses Little Mac's up-tilt despite its amazing properties, as it can catch rollers, juggle people, and makes a decent anti-air. The more you know about your character, the more possibilities you will have, they add up after a while. Next time you find a match where you struggled really hard in FG or aether's ladder, save it. Analyze every little play that occurred within the match, there might be subtle things that you might not have realized in the heat of battle. Here are some things you want to be on the look out. What are some of my habits during the match? How did my opponent punish my habits? What habits did I overlook within my opponent? Did my opponent constantly punish my rolls? Do not overlook a single detail. Be mentally active during a match, try to notice the subtle hints your opponents do during a match. When I did X move, he did Y move. Whenever I ran towards him, he did Y maneuver. Everyone has habits that can be exploited, just the better the player is, the better they are on covering said habits. Just try to be more aware of how people react to certain situations."

CrazyHand,3cx70g,GavinChase,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:00:40 2015 UTC,"Please be aware this was a response to someone else. Take the info as needed.   You're not bad you definitely have a grasp on his moves, and what they can do. You should definitely use PK Fire more. It's a good move for spacing, which is something that I feel Lucas' entire moveset is based on (multiple moves with sweet spots). Also his Zair is useful for this as well. If you're close enough and you hit them with Zair, there are some follow ups you can do.   However, I feel that you sometimes do a lot, and get nothing out of it. Like in the match with Zelda, you jumped and moved a lot, but you didn't gain anything. Sure, nothing was lost, but it's better to not move around just for the hell of it.   Nair is really good. Use that more. And once you get really comfortable with Lucas, you'll be a le to combo off of reaction, and his moves combo very well with one another, which leads to my next point.   You have to mix up with him. Like, it's damn near needed to mix up your moves wth Lucas, since the main style of play with him (the one you used) can VERY easily be adapted to. I play him too, and I was able to predict what moves you'd pick somewhat easily. That's the absolute last thing you want to happen. Bowser Jr. is also in the same boat, as well as a few other characters. It's almost criminal how easy it is to adapt to Lucas' main ""flow chart"", as opposed to someone like Sheik, Ness, or Rosalina (but then again, they're not top tiers without a good reason).  Jab saves lives. It's frame 2 I'm pretty sure, if not, then frame 3, which means it beats out almost every other attacking option in the game when up close. Learn to love the jab.   Although Lucas doesn't have a Dsmash that covers rolls, he has two moves that cover spot dodges. His Dsmash is, if I'm not mistaken, impossible to spot dodge. In higher level play, or against a good opponent, this will come in very handy. Or if you're feeling ballsy, Usmash can punish a spot dodge too. Or you could spam Dtilt, or Jab.  Whatever you want, really.   Sadly, Lucas can't really deal with pressure too well, which is why he isn't (at least how I see it) too high on the tier list, so you struggling with aggressive characters is bound to happen.   Projectile spammers shouldn't be too much of an issue if you can power shield. But good luck wth that on FG. I'm sure you're aware thay his Fsmash reflects, and he has the PSI Magnet. So someone with projectiles shouldn't be too much of a problem.   You have a tether. You don't always have to use your Up B.   Don't get grab happy. Honestly, don't rely on his grab too much. Not saying don't use it, but if they're close enough to grab, you might just want to juggle them with an Utilt, which combos into itself.   A good mix up I like is out of Dthrow. Don't always Nair. You can do Usmash, Dsmash, Utilt, Uair, Fair, and even PK Freeze out of it.   Learn how to sweet spot his attacks too. You'll need to be able to do that for certain combos, or kills.   Don't Dair too much. The end lag is too great, and unless you get the spike (both on and off stage), it's almost worthless.   Jab Jab Dsmash works sometimes. Maybe it's just because of FG lag, but I've gotten it to work more times than I thought possible. Dtilt can also combo start, since it's so fast.   Lucas is somewhat wierd. He had a great combo game but getting in is a problem. And someone else getting in on him is also a problem as well. So what you ultimately want to do is play keep away until you find an opening to get in. Then you stay in as long as you can, and rinse and repeat.   A lot of info, I know. Sorry about that. Just ask if you have more questions.   Red shirt and Duster alt are best alts."
CrazyHand,3cwwlj,AlexPlaysIbanez,3,Sat Jul 11 14:14:15 2015 UTC,"This match up is okay for Little Mac, you just need to handle it with more care than usual.   Learn how to power shield Mario's fireball spamming. As for how to power shield, it is relatively simple, just hit the shield button as late as possible, and it will make a sort of clank sound if you have done it correctly. The reason you want to powershield is because it dramatically reduces the amount of hit stun on your shield, therefore allowing you to act faster, and do more options. Just be careful because this will make you grab bait for Mario, so just have a down tilt ready for when he tries to grab you. As for Mario's down throw combos, it is honestly best just to eat hit up tilts until around 30% because if a decently player catches on to you jumping early on, he can follow up with up airs, and you will eat 2-3 times more damage because you burned your jump early on. If he tries to do his down throw combos at around 40% just jump up and away after the first hit because he won't be able to follow up with up airs as easily. How to deal with Mario's F.L.U.D.D and cape. Please learn the exact distance of your jump and your up + b. He can't gimp you with F.L.U.D.D if you recover as low as possible and get the sweet spot. This is due to Mario being unable to angle his F.L.U.D.D very low. As for his cape, save your double jump as if it is the most important thing in smash. Even if you get caped early on you should be able to make it back as long as you saved your double jump and have the exact height of you up+b down. Also, you should probably learn to wall jump, little mac has the second highest wall jump in the game, and it functions as one more jump. Seriously, what Little Mac main wouldn't want an extra jump. If you need clarification feel free to ask!"

CrazyHand,3cwwlj,ToastedEnder,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:09:29 2015 UTC,"As stated, powershield those fireballs and close the gap. Letting Mario create space will allow him to space you out and get you in throw combos. Keep moving, but play patient. Close that gap and punish when Mario is pressured by your presence.   If you're on top of him, pivot away and forward tilt into him to escape potential grabs and to ensure both hits connect.   As usual, stay from the edges. You can nab the win pretty well so long as you don't let Mario dictate the match with his fireballs.   If he's spamming them, a well timed side b can jump you over them and close the gap, and punish all in one move."
CrazyHand,3cwwlj,KimchiRathalos,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:56:08 2015 UTC,"Mario vs Little Mac I'd say is about 55/45 in mario's favor, so not entirely unwinnable. After I believe three or so up tilt at 0% you can jump out.   Power shielding is important so your shield doesn't wear away. Fireball spam on stages like Smashville (non omega) gets annoying and is hard to counter without power shield. Make good use of your jab and down tilt. Mario can actually Super Jump out of the jab at high percents, but Mac can actually fall off the ledge if you jab rapidly because of the pushback. Use your jab sparingly but some Marios may not know how to get out of jab. Best option for recovery is usually to go low and up B, but don't worry if you get caped. Little mac also has the highest wall jump in the game, and most neutral/counterpick stages have a wall somewhere. Mario is also a midweight character, and will die from Down Tilt > Rising Uppercut around 90% (90% before the down tilt). You can get it at higher percents, but try not to keep doing it because they will airdodge. If they stay in shield a lot, do a down tilt and then down angle the Forward smash. This will almost positively break their shield and if you break their shield near the edge then fully charge the B move and POW! thats the only time you should ever use that lol. Should kill Mario around 40-60% depending how close he is to the ledge, but at center stage should be around 80. Down air is also a great jab reset. If they ever miss a tech, go for a down air. It is the weakest meteor attack in the game so it works at almost any percent. Careful not to mess up after you jab lock, if you dont get them in time they will be able to block or roll. The best option after a jab lock I find is usually an up smash at kill percent or down angled forward smash at lower percents. If they miss the tech from the fsmash (which 99% of people do) go for another down air."

CrazyHand,3cwbg4,spruzo,2,Sat Jul 11 23:45:38 2015 UTC,"(Since I have potato net, I can't watch the video.)   Hip checking is when you dash towards the opponent and do a pivot tilt in the opposite direction. It works with every character just some work better than others. Some characters, like fox, when doing a hip check slide very far, while others don't slide as much. If your character doesn't slide as much, you will have to delay your pivot tilt until you get much closer to the opponent.  It beats   Shields: When you do a hip check and they shield, you should end up behind them so they cannot shield grab Spot Dodges: They will spot dodge, expecting a dash attack, but a hip check should land because when they are still dodging, you should be still running towards them or in the process of doing a pivot tilt.  Roll backs: This is probably the reason why it's called a hip check to begin with. If you do a hip check and they so happen to roll back, you should (at least for sliding characters) be able to still land the pivot tilt usually connecting with the hip of your character (Usually the furthest behind you a tilt at reach).   Hopefully this clears everything up"

The video says it trumps shields and spot dodges. The hitbox on it can reach behind you with some characters (like Mario).

CrazyHand,3cvnha,crazymoefaux,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:08:08 2015 UTC,"A cross up is when a move seems like it will hit in the front, but rather it hits behind your foe making it tricky.   I know this video isn't really smash related, but it still carries the same meaning. Anyways visual examples are better, and to note the cross up occurs at 00:03  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-mdYHOmRgY"
CrazyHand,3cvnha,SkyLightDance,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:08:11 2015 UTC,"An example of this in smash can be seen with characters such as Zss. Her n-air has both a hitbox in front of and behind her, meaning you can use it in two ways. Most frequently, you will see it used out of a short hop in an attempt to land a hit directly on her opponent with the front hit box. Secondarily, it can also be used as a cross-up in which Zss jumps toward and passed her opponent before starting the attack so that the back hitbox of the attack strikes the back of her opponent or her opponent's shield. The benefit of this sort of indirect attack being that punishing the aerial with a shield grab both takes longer and becomes more difficult for the defender; to shield grab they'd have to drop shield, pivot, and then grab, rather than simply press A while holding shield."
CrazyHand,3cvnha,Delslayer,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:45:32 2015 UTC,"In 2D classic VS fighting games (such as Street Fighter), a cross-up is when a hit touches the back of the opponent. In those games, you block inputting the direction away from the opponent. So if you are blocking a non-cross-up hit and the opponent tries to land a cross-up, you have to change your blocking direction. Sometimes it is ambiguous, and that is where it is hard.  In Smash this terms also means that the hit touches behing, but it has differents implications. If you do an aerial that touches behind the opponent, if he shields your aerial, he cannot shieldgrab you (because you land behind him). This is very important for good spacing. Also very important in Smash4 where shieldstun is not big.   I experienced this myself the hard way when playing as Jigg against opponents with big shields in Smash4. When I poorly spaced my aerials, I was shieldgrabed every time when I my aerials touches in front of the opponent.  You can try with a friend : he plays like DK and you keep on jumping on him trying to space aerial so hit and you land behind him. He has to shield your aerials and shield grab you as a punish."

CrazyHand,3cvaqy,Maymaytics,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:34:55 2015 UTC,"Spacing is all about keeping your opponent away from you, while using moves that are safe so you can't get punished. Let's use Donkey Kong as an example. His forward tilt and down tilt are both relatively fast moves with good range. (Down tilt also jab locks) these moves can be used for spacing because of their range. Whatever your main is, practice on training mode exactly where you can and can't hit your opponents. It takes time, but after a while it'll be second nature.  If you play meta knight in smash 4 spacing isn't an issue /s"

CrazyHand,3cwe0o,StevenTheHorse,2,Sat Jul 11 09:51:20 2015 UTC,"Well, it could just be that you're having a bad day or you ran into some tough opponents. Ganon is slow.

CrazyHand,3cwbol,Jeff-H_Art,7,Sat Jul 11 09:09:56 2015 UTC,"Well first up, Bowser is pretty fast for someone his weight, Ganon is ridiculously slow so I am guessing it is easier for Bowser to land the command grab.   Secondly, Bowser can feasibly Bowsercide from anywhere on stage and still pull it off, Ganon has to be offstage as far as I know.   Thirdly, Ganon is otherwise very gimpable, giving him Ganoncide makes people hesitant to edge guard him. Bowsers recovery, while not the best actually is pretty difficult to gimp."
CrazyHand,3cwbol,Raffo54,3,Sat Jul 11 10:47:43 2015 UTC,"I'd also add to this that even if Bowser doesn't go for the mutually assured destruction, his side b can still kill, and honestly even if it misses it's really not all that easy to punish (comparatively speaking). At best, Ganon's side b will force a get up option and potentially lead to either a tech chase or 1-2 hit follow up. Worst case scenario it misses, and you're stuck traveling a fixed distance, completely helpless until the animation finally ends; substantially more telegraphed and easier to punish than Bowser's. Never mind the fact that if your use either off stage and miss, Bowser can still recovery while Ganon (who can only land the kamikaze off stage) just goes into a free fall."
CrazyHand,3cwbol,Delslayer,2,Sat Jul 11 14:51:46 2015 UTC,Also the simple fact is that it truly portrays gannon he always tries to drag link down and had killed him he's truly evil. Bowser never succeeds to kill mario with something under handed canonically so his attempt here fails as well

For Ganon, the threat of Ganoncide serves as a balancing mechanism; he has bad recovery, but if the opponent is too reckless in trying to take advantage of it, he gets punished.  I agree that the difference in rules is weird and seems arbitrary, but paying attention to character-specific factors like this isn't fighting like a pussy, it's fighting smart and knowing matchups. The same way you don't challenge Ganon's Warlock Punch from the front during the super armor frames."
CrazyHand,3cwbol,Koog330,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:34:14 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind it's range is trash. Ganon is actually one of the easier characters to gimp, especially with dairs because he can pretty much do nothing about it.  When ledge guarding a Ganon you need to do it far enough away from the stage that he can't recover with flame choke. And if he's the psychotic type who will use it anyway to take you down, bait it out. He'll go free fall and die.  You gotta remember Bowser doesn't rely on his Bowsercide ability to recover."
CrazyHand,3cwbol,Koog330,2,Sat Jul 11 09:14:13 2015 UTC,"That's true, and Ganoncide doesn't always work, but it happens, and when it does happen, a lot of the time, it's by accident.   But the thing is, Ganon can easily control the direction of his Ganoncide. You do not have to be next to the ledge. I don't know the specific mechanics behind it, and some characters are different from others, but in many cases, you can actually Ganoncide when someone is standing a decent distance from the ledge.   In any case, almost all Ganons who have Ganoncided left afterwards, so there's no telling whether they're psychotic or not. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, I'm reminded of the controversy behind removing Bowsercide's/Kirbycide/Dededcide/etc. from the game."
CrazyHand,3cv4rc,TheRabidChipmunk,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:58:53 2015 UTC,"Rosalina, even with Luma is as good as doomed offstage. Her recovery also can't hurt you, so make her time offstage as lethal as possible. Also, she doesn't have the aerial mobility to chase you around while Lima bean is dead, so make that time count too. Stay in the air to make it difficult to get grabbed, but don't be reckless. As little Mac, I've been donzo'd by that at 40%"
CrazyHand,3cv4rc,jllmprrt,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:03:27 2015 UTC,"For getting Luma away, most characters can use their tilts."
CrazyHand,3cv4rc,BlankTrack,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:59:51 2015 UTC,"Use Hydro Pump to keep her in the air if you can. You can get loads of damage off of juggles against Rosalina, due to her size and floatiness. I imagine spaced fairs could be safe hits on Luma. When he's gone and she plays runaway, don't just rush at her with attacks. Most of your moves are unsafe on shield. You are faster than her, so dance around her and bait a reaction. Unless she keeps rolling away, then I would just read it and dash grab her. Up throw sets up juggles, but respect Luma when he's around. She can call him to her after being thrown, and he is an active hitbox at this time. You need to respect Luma, but don't fear him. His priority and power are immense."
CrazyHand,3cul6b,Buzz567,2,Fri Jul 10 22:14:55 2015 UTC,"The characters you mentioned are at least mid-high tier, and finding a character that has a even/good match up with them is pretty difficult.   I am pretty sure you heard the answer before, but Sheik might be the answer to your problem. Although Sheik might be at a slight slight disadvantage with the pikachu match up due to his spectacular recovery, it is pretty much considered to be at least a close to even match up. Sheik vs. Sheik is self-explanatory. Sheik vs Sonic, is slightly in Sheik's favor due to her ability to be so disruptive with her needles. You also have an advantage in the edge guarding area due to how linear his recovery is.  If you have any other questions about which secondary is best, feel free to ask."
CrazyHand,3cul6b,SkyLightDance,3,Fri Jul 10 23:34:18 2015 UTC,"Ugh. I know you're right. But I don't know how I feel playing her.  I don't wanna play some just cause their high tier. But you're right.  Though, out of curiosity, who else would you say beats sonic specifically. He's the most played character in my region, and it's such a hard matchup."
CrazyHand,3cul6b,SkyLightDance,3,Fri Jul 10 23:42:42 2015 UTC,"My guess would be Villager due to how his Lloid rocket covers almost all of Sonic's approaches. Also his slingshot will force him to recover low, which you can then punish with a bowling ball. If he gets in your face a n-air might be a decent get off me button if used sparingly."

CrazyHand,3crqo0,jllmprrt,3,Fri Jul 10 18:38:22 2015 UTC,"If you aren't serious, I realized Little Mac sucks, and I am now worshiping the new deity of man Bowser.  If you are serious, I have been busy for quite a while, and I want to make sure it is done right. Just to give a teaser of the guide..  Up-Tilt  Easily Little Mac's most underutilized tilt, and for no good reason. Utility might not be on down tilt level, but it still has its niche uses.  Utility: 3.5/5   Just a side note, as not many people don't even know the existence of this move. While its range is terrible in front, it has great range in back, and decent range on top. Decent Anti Air, this is one of the few tools Little Mac has when it comes to dealing with aerial opponents. Comes out pretty quick, but due to its pitiful range in front, try saving it for when opponents are directly above you or behind you. Good Juggling Tool, due to the fact that this move comes out quick, and has low knock-back it can pseudo-combo itself around 2-3 times. You also try to combo up+b, but it can be risky, and if you miss you will rack up some damage pretty quick. Good for Catching Rollers, outside of using down smash to catch people who roll behind you, this option is more preferable as you can rack up more damage. At higher percents it is more preferable to use a down smash due to the possibility of getting a KO."

CrazyHand,3ctlfa,professorwarhorse,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:49:41 2015 UTC,"From my experience I believe either 1313, or 2313.   1313 is regular fireball, gusty cape, regular super jump punch, and high-pressure f.l.u.d.d. Gusty cape is overall better than the regular cape, it has a wind box and reflects and will keep you stalled in the air for a short amount of time. High-pressure f.l.u.d.d. is overall better than regular f.l.u.d.d. its only drawback is that it takes a wee bit longer to charge up. But if you know mario well then you would know that most people charge up their f.l.u.d.d. between stocks when they K.O. their opponent.  2313 Is exactly the same except with fast fireball, so the only differences are the fire balls, and where your preferences lie for that particular special move."
CrazyHand,3ctlfa,SQNGQKU,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:24:03 2015 UTC,"It's preference and matchup based. Explosive punch can help where you really want to combo into a kill and its strong, but the loss of recovery is tangible. Some say gust cape is strictly better but I like turning people around at close range. Shocking cape isn't that great but might be ok for matchups against characters lacking projectiles. Fast fireball is nice to poke with but the regular helps landings out a ton. Some like high pressure fludd but I don't like getting pushed back or the long charge. I've heard people praise scalding fludd but I haven't had much experience with it.   So for me I just swap in explosive punch if id really like to combo kill (vs heavies sometimes it can be nice to secure kills before they get crazy rage) and aren't that worried about getting edge guarded. I use fast fireball if I need to disrupt someone in the mid range or if the end lag from the regular one feels too slow (vs shiek sometimes).  Don't use the jump without hitboxes or the big fireball. I don't think either offers enough to warrant their huge downsides."

Watch for the PK Fire spam, it's a pretty tired&true way to space you out. Unless you're really close, his  tether grab has enough startup & endlag to be very punishable.  Lucas' jab hitbox extends through his body, so if you're standing close enough to him from behind he'll hit you and pull your out in front of him.  the quick & easy ""combo"" Lucas' (Lucaii?) use is the multi-hit nair->nair->nair etc. this move will ALWAYS pop you out in front of whichever direction Lucas is facing. use that knowledge to your advantage, because Lucas sure as hell is going to.  Lucas Dthrow goes mostly vertical, watch out for the followup uair PK HooHah (or Uspash at low %s).  watch out for the tilts, as they come out pretty quick, especially the utilt, which can even juggle you up when you're to the side of him.  BE WARY OF THE DSmash EDGE GUARD it has three hitboxes in succession, so you'll always want to snap to edge for the invincibility. recover low as you can."

CPU practice is terrible because obviously they arent human, so they wont be doing things that real players would actually be doing.   Also, Im not trying to insult you or say youre bad, but it might be that you want to want to get good and improve, rather than actually wanting to improve and wanting put in the work necessary to improve and make that jump. Not sure who your main is (assuming samus due to your flair) but you should check out smashboards or even the character guides on this sub as they are both good options to learning your character and such!  Also, be wary of bad habits! I know that when I was starting out, I had a terrible rolling habit and it was pretty annoying and tough to break.

And frankly, all good games do this. When I first played Super Mario Brothers in the eighties, it was hard. Lots of dying happened, and I was happy to get to levels I'd laugh at these days.  The truth is: You don't want an easy game. You wouldn't get your money's worth, nor would you achieve any sense of accomplishment.  You log back on right now and take your licks. And when your opponent is teabagging the stage, taunting, and changing his tag to mock you, you write his fucking name down and how badly he beat you. Then, next time you see him and do a bit better, you teabag him right back.  And when you finally beat him one day, change your tag to ""Revenge,"" then leave right away and never fight him again.

CrazyHand,3cpx16,Dapplegonger,5,Thu Jul 9 22:23:11 2015 UTC,"For Glory is frustrating, but you can definitely get used to it.   Try a new character. And I mean one that you've NEVER even thought about before. One that you don't even want to touch because you think he/she/it sucks or isn't your style.   Do some light research on it, like maybe five minutes of research, just know what generic combos are good, what are good kill moves, what your best throw is, whether they're good or bad in the air, etc. (If you need help with this one I can give some generic info).   And then play it on FG. Don't even give a fuck if you lose. Trust me, when you play a completely ??? character you won't be as angry when you lose. Play it on FG and just keep going. Force yourself through those 10% wins. And then keep going until you become an absolute boss.   I had around 48~50% win rate. I was maining Lucario, ZSS, and Capt. Falcon. I thought I was doing alright but I lost too much. So then one day I picked up Bowser. Yeah, motherfucking Bowser, he isn't that good, dude's huge, not to quick, and prone as fuck to gimps and easy kills. Dude's got weaknesses all over the board. But you know what I picked him up just for no reason at all, because I thought why not play the heaviest bitch in the game?  Well now he's suddenly my main, my go-to guy to revenge kill. I have around 80% win rate with him. It's just magical. I can almost always count on him.   Then I tried Pacman. Who the fuck likes Pacman? I don't wanna learn that Z-droppin shit, ain't nobody got time for that. But I just tried him because the dude can turn into a ball and eat you. Now he's my quaternary. And I play 15 characters. A little ball of shit is my fourth best character to play.   Then there's Marth. Man I sucked asswipe with Marth for my whole life and everyone said he was a piece of shit because his range decreased or something. I didn't even like how Marth played. Jump here jump there and fair nair bair dair uair god damn. But now he's my Secondary. From shit to secondary. That's something else.   My point is, there always might be one character out there that you're secretly amazing at, that fits your playstyle perfectly. But you will NOT find out what character that is by just touching it a couple of times. You have to take a beating, persist, and keep going, and you'll know what characters you excel at.   A lot of people just choose the best characters... But if you're like me and you DO NOT GIVE A SHIT about tournaments, and you want For Glory to be the highest level of competition you ever want to participate in, just choose a ton of different characters.   Maybe you think you're good at Combos, but you're better at reads. That's the case for me. I thought I was beast at Falcon combos. Turns out I'm better at reads.   Try different things and try them seriously."

I personally would recommend finding a character other than Samus by the way, a lot of people on For Glory have lots of experience fighting that character.

The length of time is up to you but I would just go for a day or two (if that doesn't work, go for a week).  Now when you come back try practicing some basic movement and combos (or whatever you usually do when playing; small things).  Regarding what caused it, if you were playing online it was probably the lag. Whenever I go online sometimes I won't be able to time my fast falling properly, effectively screwing up all of my movement and it just turns into a domino effect and avalanches out of control.

I am not hungry and do not need to go to the toilet. I am sitting in a chair that is the exact same height as the one i sit in to play at home.   If all those condition are met, I will destroy 99% of my opponent. Anything else and i will play very badly.  Also, being drunk & high make me play 10x better. I stop thinking and rely entirely on instinct. Sometime, it make me do stupid things, but stupid thing with flawless execution are better than smart thing badly done.  It took me a long time to figure out those things, but knowing myself allow me to get better. At least, I know when to accept money match and when to refuse.  As to how to solve your problem, try to figure out what is different recently that was not the case previously. It can anything at all. Like a bad day at work or a bad news. Even if your not thinking about it while playing, it influence how you play. When my great uncle whom I never met died, I did not give a fuck, but i spent a week playing badly because I knew I had to go to his funeral and i hate that.

CrazyHand,3cpmd8,AnotherThroneAway,4,Sat Jul 11 20:11:20 2015 UTC,"Everyone says take a break but Imma be honest with you I do not want to take a break unless I actually want to.   What I did was pick up a new character. Don't choose the character. Just take one at random for no particular reason, and try it. Play him until your win/loss ratio is a sucky piece of shit. Don't care if it's 10% or 5%. Don't switch from that character when you lose. Just keep playing until you get good or you hate it.   I did that a lot and I'm really happy with being able to play a lot of characters efficiently. There's a few that I never liked, but there's also a lot that I loved. My friend chose one for me at random, like legit just closed his eyes and pointed at the screen. He chose Bowser. Now Bowser's my main.   I'll do the same. Greninja or Duck Hunt Dog, I pointed in the middle  Get to it buddy"

CrazyHand,3cpmd8,CreaminFreeman,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:34:34 2015 UTC,"I do want to take a break, so I'm fine with that.  I'll try that though. If I don't already play the character and I can stand TO play them, then I'll try that after. I already have a main/secondaries, but it should be fun."
CrazyHand,3cpmd8,Jeff-H_Art,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:13:07 2015 UTC,"Haha I've tried so many characters that I other than Bowser being my main, my secondaries/tertiaries switch around every several days.   It definitely makes the game fun when you can play half or 3/4 of the roster!"
CrazyHand,3cpmd8,Eontios,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:07:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know how to play a good chunk of the cast. Some of them I'm better at than others, but I have learned a few characters before."
CrazyHand,3cpmd8,gbnubcake,2,Fri Jul 10 02:18:25 2015 UTC,"To add to what everyone else has already said; be aware of the cycle ""I'm upset because I'm losing, and I'm losing because I'm upset."" Most people go through it at some point, so yeah, take a breather from the salt before refocusing. Mental attitude does affect performance, so do something you find fun, whether it's smash-related or not."
CrazyHand,3cpmd8,wuzup11,2,Thu Jul 9 21:23:45 2015 UTC,"Definately take a break.  Ive gone through this a few times and taking 2-3 days off usually helps out. Also, before playing online or with friends I find warming up against computers helps me a bit too."
CrazyHand,3cpmd8,watermelonpickle,2,Thu Jul 9 23:31:11 2015 UTC,"This actually happened to me a couple weeks ago. Everyone says its good to take a break, but what I find works for me (I often get trapped in loops of getting upset because I play bad and then playing bad because I'm upset) is instead of taking a couple days off, get some friends together and play some four-man (or higher) FFA matches together. Play with items, play with stupid special smash settings, play with 2.0 KB ratio, whatever. Once, my group even played four Meta Knights on Hyrule in Brawl. The point is to play purely for fun. Play Smash like you would if you and your friends were 10 again. I find that this helps me relax the best and stop focusing so damn hard on winning."
CrazyHand,3cpmd8,Creepytoilethand,2,Fri Jul 10 15:00:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly, since I've been without internet access at my new apartment lately, I've found that the break from online play with only a weekly to twice weekly smash session with my friend I've gotten better than when I was playing FG and Anther's nonstop."
CrazyHand,3cpdkj,AnotherThroneAway,3,Thu Jul 9 18:25:24 2015 UTC,"Megaman has a few low-percent throw combos that you should learn. Those would be some of the easiest things to learn first. Then, learn how to juggle with shorthopped uairs. Those tornados are some of the best juggling moves in the game.   Those two are the most important, but you should also get comfortable with your metal blade and lemons. Metal blades can help you create a ""maze of projectiles"" by cutting off some of your opponent's approaches and recoveries. It could help to learn how to glide toss, but it's not totally necessary (if you do wanna learn to glide toss I think downwards and fading glide tosses are the most important to learn). The mega buster is important for spacing. You can use f-tilt to approach while applying shield pressure, retreating SH nairs to make some space between you and your opponent, and jabs to trump dash attacks or dash grabs."
CrazyHand,3cpdkj,thebigro,5,Thu Jul 9 19:19:03 2015 UTC,"Great summary.  Small elaborations:  1)  The down-throw combos you want to you know are D-Throw -> Fair and D-Throw -> VERY fast RAR Bair.  Both combos are useful depending on the opponent's DI.  2)  U-Air juggling is great, and allows you to bait air dodges like nobody's business.  Use that and your crazy-meaty U-Smash hitbox to finish off someone that you've just launched at high percentages.  Also, try incorporating Rush into your juggles for hilariously stupid kills.  3)  THE METAL BLADE CAN BE THROWN IN 8 DIRECTIONS AND Z-DROPPED; ALL OF THESE ARE USEFUL OPTIONS.  Internalize this, and try to remember that not every MB has to connect to achieve the desired effect.  Opponents have to respect this thing - it deals great damage if they eat it, and often leads to a free grab - which means that their options are limited if you aim your MB correctly.  Seriously, MB is love, MB is life.  4) Jump-cancelled Glide Tossing is useful for when you need to move and throw at the same time, but don't expect to pull off the infinite down-throw combo as advertised in most situations.  Pulling it off while running away from an opponent is much more useful; a lot of people will chase you blindly and eat a MB for 10-15% if you throw it correctly.  If you master the JCGT and want to learn a similar, wavedash-esque AT, try out the Dash Item Throw-Cancelled Item Throw (DITCIT for short) - it's much more precise, but it can really cross up an opponent who is not expecting it.  5) Your third lemon has end lag regardless of whether it's a f-tilt, jab, or nair.  Good opponents will punish you for spamming lemons.  They're meant for spacing and they're great to a point, but they're not completely safe if you just mash the attack button.  Megaman requires a little bit of effort to use effectively, but he's super rewarding when played effectively.  If you want to get hype for the character, go watch StylesX2, Zucco, and Beatfox over on the ol' Youtube.  Welcome to the Mega crew, R O C K B O Y S 4 L Y F E"
CrazyHand,3cpdkj,KickToTheUterus,2,Thu Jul 9 20:02:54 2015 UTC,Thanks for the elaborations and thanks for making me wish people got this hyped for Yoshi and Villager :(
CrazyHand,3cpdkj,thebigro,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:16:24 2015 UTC,"I mean, Villager has his share of dank memes, and Yoshi is pretty universally agreed-upon as A-Tier.  E G G B O Y S just doesn't have the same ring to it."
CrazyHand,3cpdkj,KickToTheUterus,2,Thu Jul 9 20:52:02 2015 UTC,I get it but what about D I N O B O Y S?
CrazyHand,3cpdkj,thebigro,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:05:43 2015 UTC,I especially like this because of the irony.
CrazyHand,3cpdkj,thebigro,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:19:09 2015 UTC,"Damn, this is awesome! Thanks so much!  I want to main MM because I love his playstyle, but he has such a wide range of moves, it's hard to know where to begin. I've also been relying a bit too heavily on some moves I don't see the pros use as often, so I probably have some habits to break (and certainly some to form)."
CrazyHand,3cpdkj,thebigro,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:28:11 2015 UTC,"Wow, great stuff, thanks! I'm pretty decent at juggling with uairs, but I'm not so hot on the throw combos. Which in particular should I practice? I honestly don't even know what to combo with his throws at all. I usually just back throw and wind up another barrage of projectiles."
CrazyHand,3cpdkj,thebigro,2,Fri Jul 10 05:22:24 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, bthrow is a KO at mid-high percents, so best to save those for when you need them. Dthrow is your main combo throw. You get d-throw to fair to FF uair at lower percents, and you can check the other comment left in reply to my original for more."
CrazyHand,3cpdkj,thebigro,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:24:07 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay. I'll work on that, then. Sorta bummed dthrow is only 4%, and I think fair is 8%, so the two in tandem are only 1% more than bthrow. I guess it doesn't really shine until you can follow the fair with the FF uair or whatever, but I just ain't that mega, yet. >.<"
CrazyHand,3cpdkj,thebigro,2,Sat Jul 11 07:16:02 2015 UTC,"Also, this video was just posted on /r/smashbros"

CrazyHand,3cpdkj,alanamablamaspama,2,Sat Jul 11 19:18:38 2015 UTC,The dtilt is cool to start combos at lower percents. I personally don't use it much...
CrazyHand,3cpdkj,thebluecrab,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:30:35 2015 UTC,lol you'll get the hang of it. The FF uair isn't guaranteed but it's the easiest way to start a juggle.
CrazyHand,3cpdkj,mindivy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:00:08 2015 UTC,"I haven't played around with this part yet, so forgive my ignorance, but why not go straight dthrow > hop uair juggle?"
CrazyHand,3cpdkj,mindivy,2,Sat Jul 11 19:17:55 2015 UTC,You would have to run underneath your opponents. Upthrow puts you in a better position to juggle.
CrazyHand,3cpjax,Onehates9GAG,8,Thu Jul 9 19:11:25 2015 UTC,"They both offer many things. Melee had a larger scene, and the game doesn't get updated and tweaked. It's an official game.   Project m has more characters and more viable characters, newer graphics, some brawl tech like rar/DACUS, gets updated every so often.   Both have many little quirks. You should probably just try them both and see which you like."
CrazyHand,3cpjax,1-800-948-8488,6,Thu Jul 9 19:39:55 2015 UTC,Project M is more balanced imo but doesn't have as big of a scene as melee.    They're both good in their own rights but for different reasons. Personally I like PM better because it buffed a lot of low/mid-tier melee/brawl characters and most characters feel awesome to play as.
CrazyHand,3cpjax,123123sora,3,Thu Jul 9 22:48:03 2015 UTC,"This. There's no way I could conceivably do well with Kirby in Melee, but in PM I'm on even ground with everyone else."
CrazyHand,3cpjax,Starblazer626,6,Thu Jul 9 23:59:09 2015 UTC,It depends on which one you like more
CrazyHand,3cpjax,thebluecrab,2,Thu Jul 9 19:41:27 2015 UTC,I love PM because there's so many characters to play and I don't feel like I'm gonna fight against only 15 year veterans.
CrazyHand,3cpjax,globalabortion,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:51:05 2015 UTC,"I find it good to learn both. I enjoy PM much more then Melee, but Melee has a bigger scene and I love going to tournaments. When my friends are over though, we always play PM."
CrazyHand,3cpjax,GoldWinchester,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:10:14 2015 UTC,"Depends on what system you have, and how competitive you want to get? Melee and Smash 4 are obviously the most competitive right now.  But they both have their respective systems, Gamecube and WiiU.  If youonly have a Pc, you an play project M and I highly recommend it and getting the netplay version so you can play online.  Biggest question though is Why Choose? I play them all equally so long as I'm not going every tournament and just trying to have fun"

Just by playing the game and experimenting, they find out what works and what doesn't."
CrazyHand,3cpz9z,FlyingDiglett,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:36:12 2015 UTC,One thing to do is watch top Marth videos. Watch a match of Mew2King on Final Destination. He gets crazy combos all the time there
CrazyHand,3cpz9z,FlameMammoth,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:03:49 2015 UTC,"Like others have mentioned, watch Mew2King's Marth. But also learn the ""Ken Combo"". (Down tilt, Nair, fair, dair)  A youtube search would bring it up."
CrazyHand,3cpz9z,thebluecrab,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:11:44 2015 UTC,A Ken Combo is just fair -> dair

CrazyHand,3cpbho,Mechyoshi,2,Thu Jul 9 18:08:44 2015 UTC,"Sheik vs Robin MU is in her favorite. Needles interrupt his moves, and she's fast enough with low enough endlag to pressure and punish Robin extensively. As for roll punishing, either d-smash, dash attack, or grab."

You have to start somewhere, and that somewhere is being destroyed at your first tourney."

CrazyHand,3cpton,MegaMetal96,5,Thu Jul 9 22:08:53 2015 UTC,"Crazy how something as simple as speed completely changes a character. If Samus was as fast as Falcon, she'd play completely differently."

CrazyHand,3cpton,MegaMetal96,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:48:56 2015 UTC,Yup.
CrazyHand,3cpton,thebluecrab,2,Thu Jul 9 23:18:53 2015 UTC,Didn't everyone have the same nair in 64?
CrazyHand,3cpton,_IAlwaysLie,4,Fri Jul 10 05:31:41 2015 UTC,I'm under the impression that ZSS and Shiek are similar.
CrazyHand,3cpton,_IAlwaysLie,3,Thu Jul 9 20:59:01 2015 UTC,"They have their similarities I suppose. Great mobility, safe approach options, strong combo game."
CrazyHand,3cpton,Dapplegonger,3,Thu Jul 9 21:07:20 2015 UTC,"Not to mention very similar down Bs and Dairs, along with a low-power quick projectile neutral."
CrazyHand,3cpton,Maymaytics,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:22:06 2015 UTC,I like to compare (Toon) Link and Mega Man. I also feel like Ryu is basically a better Little Mac.
CrazyHand,3cpton,Thomas446,2,Thu Jul 9 21:46:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, most of the item-spawning characters like Diddy, ROB, and peach share plenty of strategy. And I can definitely see a parallel between Ryu and Mac."

CrazyHand,3cpton,Maymaytics,3,Thu Jul 9 23:38:59 2015 UTC,They both have very good ground control
CrazyHand,3cpton,JIH7,2,Fri Jul 10 21:54:00 2015 UTC,They're both on the small side and have gloves on. All I can think of.
CrazyHand,3cpton,watermelonpickle,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:34:17 2015 UTC,"Ness/Falcon, to me (which partly makes sense given the character design in 64 in general). They've got upairs that hit in arcs are good falling options and combo/string into shit, bairs that have a clean/soft hit are as safe on shield as stuff gets in this game and KO early, versatile aerials in general. Also frame 3 repeating jabs, many combo/string starter moves, downthrow combos, good juggle options, good advantageous state in general, stylish ways to KO disgustingly early, ftilts that can be angled, side-Bs that are not as good as For Glory thinks they are, questionable recoveries, and probably other stuff."
CrazyHand,3cpton,atglobe,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:54:46 2015 UTC,"Lucas and Pac Man have the same fair, a headbutt for uair, a flurry of kicks for down air, a Nair that involves spinning around where their entire body is the hitbox, and a bair that's a backwards kick.  Sonic has the same bair as Samus and the same dair as ZSS and Sheik.  Ike has the same Nair and fair as Shulk. They also both have a counter.  Jigglypuff and Kirby both have six jumps and a similar dair, and Kirby's bair is similar to Puff's fair. Although Kirby's fair is similar to Fox's.  Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong both have a fast dtilt and a quick backwards kick for bair. They also both have a very fast uair with good kill power and combo potential.  Also, some custom moves are similar to the moves of other characters. Mario's fast fireball is like a cross between the Fox and Falco lasers, Villagers tripping sapling is like a more devious version of Diddy's banana peel and Ness/Fox have customs reminiscent of Lucas/Wolf."
