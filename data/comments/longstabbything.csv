Great to see a consistent channel and I believe you're a hero for sharing the best of Karl and the gang's antics around the world.A few questions.  How do you sort through numerous 3 hours shows to find the best bits for a 10 minute video? i.e what's your video production process like?   Do you feel you've left a lot of good stuff out from past shows? Will you be posting them in the future? Or do you not back up your Today show files?"
longstabbything,3ah3hs,CounterClockworkOrng,3,Sun Jun 21 06:26:21 2015 UTC,"Ah good questions! lol  thanks so much, I usually put a video up once a month and keep them just under the 10 min mark. its just easier for me and also I feel like its a good buffer for when things air live and if anything goes viral the show get the exposure then later on ill add it to the compilation.   I want people to still watch the show and not just rely on my videos, but I know a big part of the following is from overseas so they just wait for the vids.   I have a system now where if I don't watch the show live I'll record it and I pretty much know the formula so will know when serious stuff is scheduled in the show and just fast forward through it. I then take the funny bits from each show and transfer them to my laptop and go through them and try and make a themed vid.  There is a lot of stuff left out, usually because it doesn't fit the theme in the vid or it wasn't as funny looking back at it or its too long and if you cut it up it wont make sense. But I do save those bits for future ones to add in or I put up ""the lost tapes"" which will usually have those bits.   I think the main thing that's keeping me going is Karl of course and if he ever leaves the show (he just signed on for another 3 years with Lisa) then I'll finally finish them up."
longstabbything,3ah3hs,holymotherogod,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:23:17 2015 UTC,So the today show is a daily thing im assuming. Is it always this amazing? I live in California and I want to watch this show everyday. Any idea how?
longstabbything,3ah3hs,holymotherogod,3,Sat Jun 20 04:26:32 2015 UTC,It's on in the mornings from 5.30am to 9am. so if you work out the time difference from Aus to Cali you could find some sort of live stream online. I'm not entirely sure if they still do their own live stream on channel 9 website or not? Some people have said they can watch it in other countries.  Like I said out of a weeks footage which is around 18 hours I would probably only get about 10-15 mins of funny bits out of it.
