Also make sure that it is almost completely cooled when you go to take it out of the mold, that should also hopefully keep it from falling apart"

Baking,3e34zb,thebigslide,6,Tue Jul 21 20:19:53 2015 UTC,"You don't have to grease/flour a silicone pan as long as it's clean.  Scrub it with baking soda if there's residue on it.   Get your baking time down pat with a test run. Turn the oven off with 5 minutes to go, but don't peek.  Let it finish the last 5 minutes with the element off. Open the door and let it sit for two minutes. Take it out and let it cool on the counter on a cooling rack for 15 minutes. Stick it in the freezer for 5 minutes.   You're trying to get the silicone to contract by freezing it.  It will gracefully ""pop"" on all sides.  Same technique you use to get fragile tart crusts out of tart pans."

Baking,3e34zb,Outlulz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:52:30 2015 UTC,"Think Geek sells these.  Here are their recommendations:   Some tips:  Fill cavity to almost full. Tilt the pan to cover all surfaces before putting in the oven.  Recipes with yeast work best, because the batter will grow to fill all the nooks as they bake. Also nice? Many yeast recipes don't necessitate icing, and that way the mold's numbers may be visible on your final product.  Don't forget to coat the outside of the mold, around the opening, with non-stick spray. Your batter is going to rise as it cooks, and it's much harder to get these out of the pan if the cake is stuck on the top of the mold as well as inside it."

Baking,3e34zb,Riyumi,4,Tue Jul 21 17:21:58 2015 UTC,"Although for my normal pans I tend to let them fully cool...I personally find with the silicon ones that if they cool for too long the steam gets trapped and prevents a clean release regardless of greasing/flowering the pan. I tend to get the cleanest release from silicon if it cools for about 5-10 minutes then transfer to a cooling rack. It will still be warm to the touch but not hot at that point. At that time what steam has condensed between the cake and the mold will actually help with the release, but when it starts to cool the edges get soft from the trapped steam and that's when they get sticky."
Baking,3e34zb,Skarvha,2,Tue Jul 21 18:22:00 2015 UTC,"Did you use a cake mix or make your own? Cakes mixes don't work very well in shaped pans like this because they are very light and airy.

Then I realized that because they have no structure, you have to put it on a sheet pan anyway.  Plus they don't brown the same as a metal pan, so the muffins are cooked but don't have that crisp exterior and look like they're undercooked.  Haven't used one since."

If it's just a regular indoor party, most desserts, less ice creams and frozen treats, can sit out for a period of time without going bad. Things like cupcakes, cookies, brownies, bars, tarts, pastries should all be fine. If you're looking at leaving dessert in heat, like under the sun for a while, then I would stay away from things like whipped cream, buttercream, some mousses and generally more liquid/non-cooked elements as they don't hold, can get messy, and may turn. Most things, especially baked items, should be fine without refrigeration for some time."

Baking,3duux3,shanninc,13,Sun Jul 19 18:23:42 2015 UTC,"It was quite simple. The cake itself is chocolate, so I replaced the milk with some (fresh made :P ) almond milk. For the frosting, I based it on this recipe: http://www.veganbaking.net/recipes/cake-decorating/frostings/creamy-white-frosting. I tend to be pretty casual with frostings, just throwing the ingredients together and whipping and adjusting quantities until I have the texture I'm looking for.

Baking,3duux3,GingerCookie,8,Sun Jul 19 22:31:37 2015 UTC,"Basically I took a piece of wax paper big enough to wrap around the cake, laid it out flat on the counter and marked off the size of the cake (height and circumference) as a guide (flipping it over so not to get marker in the chocolate), starting right at the bottom of the sheet so I could easily align the bottom of the chocolate with the bottom of the cake.  Once the chocolate was tempered: I loaded up a trusty pastry bag with a small tip (don't know size, maybe 1mm opening), and created the design I wanted on the paper.  After letting it set until it was hard enough to the touch where it didn't leave chocolate on my fingers, but still malleable enough to bend (happened much faster than I was expecting, maybe four minutes), I carefully lifted the strip and wrapped it around the cake, pressing it just slightly into the frosting so it would hold in place, but not squish in, and then put it back in the fridge for a few minutes to fully harden.  The cake frosting should be hard enough to keep the chocolate from just squishing right in.  I refrigerated the cake slightly before attempting to apply the chocolate"

Baking,3dx3mr,organiker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:26:56 2015 UTC,"Since you said you are better at decorating than baking, I will help you by telling you this:  I don't know what recipe you are using, but weighing ingredients in baked goods is much better than using measuring cups. You will get the same cake consistently with weighing.  Do not over-mix your batter. Mix only until the flour is no longer visible, then stop. Over mixing develops the gluten in the mix and you get a tougher cake.  Every oven is different. Use an oven thermometer to make sure the oven you're using is true, if not, you will know and can adjust how to set your temperature correctly--for example, if you set your oven at 350, but the oven thermometer measures 400, you know you need to reduce what you heat your oven to (50 degrees) so you can maintain 350. Make sense?  Altitudes are different.   Ambient temperature is different.   Humidity is different.   I would start checking your cake at 40 minutes. First look to see if the top looks super wet--if you have a window in your oven door, do this without opening (this first time). Does the center look wetter/shinier than the sides? If so, not done. Set the timer for 5 more minutes. When the timer goes off, look again--this time crack the door open to see better-- if not wet looking, push your finger gently and quickly into the center of the cake. If it springs back, it's done. If it stays indented, leave the cake in and set the timer for 5 more minutes. Continue this process every 5 minutes until the cake springs back up. Touch a different test-spot in the center each time.   I used to be dependent on recipes to tell me when a cake was done, but once you know what to look for, then you understand that the times on recipes are a guide more than a rule. That's when you learn HOW to bake because you understand why you are doing what you're doing.   If you have any more questions, feel free to message me--I would be happy to help you.   Also, here is a link to a blog with tons of videos and useful information that will help you. She is where I learned the mechanics of baking and to bake a cake 'until it's done'.  Good luck!  http://www.gretchensbakery.com/until-its-done/  Edit: For clarity"

They're about as easy as you can get without resorting to buying cookie dough.    1 cup peanut butter 1 cup sugar 1 egg 1 teaspoon vanilla (optional)   Just mix all the ingredients together, then bake at 350 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes.

They are pretty much foolproof. And it's a cheaper alternative to buying flour/sugar/eggs/butter/vanilla when you're just starting out. The mixes are usually easy to experiment with too, such as adding extra chocolate chips or caramel etc.   If you're wanting to bake from scratch, the best places to start are with something like a one-bowl brownie/bar cookie recipe or a basic chocolate chip cookie.

The problem is that when professionals make pizza, they bake at very very high temperatures which you cannot achieve in your average home oven. This makes their crust extra crispy without burning the ingredients on top. Since I assume you don't have that option, I think baking it separately for a little bit first might help. Also make sure you put enough oil/butter on it to make it crisp. I hope that helps!"

Baking,3dr8d3,DondeT,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:21:40 2015 UTC,But wouldn't that make the brownies a bit more dry? Couldn't I just like... microwave the raspberries a bit beforehand to compensate or would that be bad?
Baking,3dr8d3,DondeT,3,Sat Jul 18 19:49:03 2015 UTC,"The frozen raspberries will cause the temperature of the batter to be lower. The extra baking time will just allow it to get to the same temperature as normal meaning that it'll be just as cooked as normal, not over cooked.   If you want you can defrost them first but it's just adding an additional step that ultimately won't result in a different product."
Baking,3drxmy,TimelessDCAM,2,Sat Jul 18 21:44:09 2015 UTC,"I've made this recipe a lot. But I see problem with this recipe..see how after it's done, it still has several spots of untouched, powdery cake mix? There shouldn't be any of that. Personally, instead of cutting the butter into pieces, I melt it first, and then I can easily coat the whole thing.  I (and everyone else I've made it for) also prefer more butter. 1 stick of butter WILL work, but it gives you a topping closer to cake, and you also might not coat all of the cake mix, leaving you with some powder left.  If you want a more crumbly, buttery crust, go for 2 sticks. This is what me and my family prefer.  If you're scared of it being too buttery, go for about 1 1/2 sticks.  Give it a try though, it's addicting."

It was originally called the ""Doctor Bird Cake,"" named after a type of hummingbird, in some press packets Jamaica's tourism board sent to the US. (At least according to Jamie Oliver) Doesn't really tell us much about what would qualify as a hummingbird cake in terms of flavor or type, but still pretty interesting."

Baking,3doznc,abert000,2,Sat Jul 18 01:54:42 2015 UTC,That's a very good question... so I googled it a couple of different ways and if I understand correctly in this particular recipe the egg proteins bond with the gluten proteins and build the structure that ends up being the cookie. It would also take some experimentation to come up with the right amount of fat replacement (butter) and another type of protein that will bond with the gluten protein to form the cookie.
Baking,3doznc,tempest63,2,Sat Jul 18 03:06:30 2015 UTC,"The yolk proteins do seem to be the key...maybe a tablespoon of full fat Greek yogurt?  In general yogurt (greek or regular, unsweetened), applesauce, and ground flax seeds mixed with water are all frequently used as egg substitutes.

Baking,3digcv,skamnorth,8,Thu Jul 16 17:41:47 2015 UTC,I don't really have a recipe but I can give you a basic walk through!   I did Swiss meringue but Italian works great too. I'm not 100% satisfied with the ice cream so I won't share a recipe of that. But use any slower melting ice cream or parfait with a good vanilla flavour.   Swiss meringue:   150g egg white 300g caster sugar   Whip over water bath until the sugar grains are gone (there is a preferred temperature but I don't remember it) Then whip until nice and firm. This should be enough for 3 disks for a small cake or two for a larger one and some small ones for decorating.  And here is the assembly from top to bottom  Caramel sauce  Small meringues  Preferred fruit (I had bananas)  Cream (whipped it with some vanilla and a little bit of sugar)  Meringue disk  Preferred fruit  Ice cream  Meringue disk  Ice cream  Meringue disk

Baking,3djfpp,DondeT,9,Thu Jul 16 23:30:38 2015 UTC,How much baking powder did you put in? It looks like it might have expanded too much and shrunk back again.
Baking,3djfpp,bebble,6,Thu Jul 16 19:50:21 2015 UTC,"This is the same thing that happens when I don't adjust new recipes for my high altitude location. The suggestions I've gotten are: add more flour (like a couple Tbsp maybe for a cake this size), make sure your eggs and any liquids are room temp, get an oven thermometer (the built-in ones are often inaccurate) and bake at 5-10 degrees F above recommended temp, and DON'T open the door til cooking time is done (also try to avoid stomping around the oven - my grandma swore by this). Hope this helps! Baking is always about continually tweaking recipes for your location and oven."
Baking,3djfpp,Geogirl16,3,Thu Jul 16 22:53:02 2015 UTC,"If you are at a high altitude as well, you may need to adjust your liquids and/or the amount of baking powder you use."
Baking,3djfpp,_jillybean,4,Fri Jul 17 00:08:32 2015 UTC,"This used to happen to me a lot. My mom told me to wrap a wet dishtowel around the pan before I put it in the oven. It sound really silly but I have never had that happening to me ever again since I started doing that. My cakes bake so evenly now, it's like freaking magic :D"
Baking,3djfpp,RubyGetsNaked,6,Thu Jul 16 21:44:54 2015 UTC,"Well, the reasoning behind that is so that the wet towel absorbs some of the heat and it doesn't get transferred to the batter. Otherwise, the batter closest to the walls of the pan get hotter quicker, this means it sets quicker, and doesn't rise as much. The center doesn't get as hot, doesn't set as quickly, and keeps rising. So without the towel you have a cake with a dome, center is higher.   I don't know how this reasoning works with a fallen center, but not certain that you're wrong, but it would seem under that logic putting the towel would only make the outer ring rise more."
Baking,3djfpp,californicat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:17:05 2015 UTC,I have no idea what it does or how it works but it worked for me so I wanted to share the tip :)
Baking,3djfpp,RubyGetsNaked,4,Fri Jul 17 10:09:07 2015 UTC,Did it fall down before or after you took it out?
Baking,3djfpp,FarbrorJorgen,4,Thu Jul 16 23:54:18 2015 UTC,Could be that you didn't bake it long enough. The outermost crust could be fully baked but if you pulled it out of the oven too soon then as it cools it will drop in the center. When you're cake is done it should spring back in the center if you lightly press is.
Baking,3djfpp,ours_de_sucre,2,Fri Jul 17 04:55:00 2015 UTC,Too much baking powder. Decrease by 1/3 and try again.
Baking,3djfpp,pigletpoppet,2,Fri Jul 17 00:26:01 2015 UTC,Could be too much liquid in the batter or underbaked.
Baking,3djfpp,JezkaRabbit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:58:11 2015 UTC,It might be too much baking powder. Like a lot of what the others have said it may also be your altitude where you are at.

Baking,3dl5v3,tgoddess,2,Fri Jul 17 18:02:57 2015 UTC,"Swiss meringue butter cream.  This is made by heating your egg whites and sugar together over a double boiler, whipping into a meringue until cool and then beating in your butter.  Frankly, for practicing piping I use plain american buttercream (shortening and powdered sugar).  I practice either on silpats or, if I need practice doing sides of cake, i just use a 3"" high cake pan placed upside down on a pedestal.  I then use a rubber spatula to scrape it off and re-use/re-do as often as I need.  It'll keep practically for months in the fridge and it doesn't even matter that much, because I'd never actually EAT it.  For actually recipes...well, I just make a LOT of them and either give them away at work or to neighbors.  If you use recipes that measure by weight, it's pretty easy to cut them down by half or even by 1/4 for testing/tasting purposes.  I do this quite a bit, too."

It's 3 layers, made with a standard devil's food box mix (sorry!) with ice cream mixed in. This seriously makes the moistest cake ever. The frosting is 1/2 cup of butter, a splash of vanilla, with icing sugar gradually mixed in until it was the right consistency (I don't really measure when I'm making frosting). Then I mashed up some local strawberries, strained them, and put the juice in until it tasted right!   This was my first time piping flowers like this, and I'm really excited with how they came out.

Baking,3dimc9,solace_v,4,Thu Jul 16 15:56:53 2015 UTC,"Unfortunate real talk moment incoming.      Working in a bakery is hard work. A lot of it is boring and repetitive. They need 12 dozen cookies scooped and pressed out. Guess what you're doing for the next hour and a half? It's physically taxing. You're on your feet the whole time. Why? Because you work faster on your feet. Most bakeries spend so much on overhead they need you to work as fast as possible to maintain their bottom line.      It can take up to six months to train someone properly, longer for someone who has no commercial kitchen experience. A lot of kitchens will be wary about hiring someone who needs so much money invested in them to become efficient. Especially if that someone is not relying on the job for their rent and food money. I'm not saying this is you but in general that person is more likely to get frustrated/bored/hurt/burned out and quit.     I'm not saying it's a bad decision. I think it's great that you want to branch out into a new field. I'm just saying people will probably be hesitant to hire you right out of the gate. Make it clear that you'll take any position as long as they're willing to teach you to bake in the future. Prove that you're worth the investment by being hard working, not complaining about the shit tasks you'll inevitably get (they're a test to make sure you're not a shit heel), and being positive and assertive about your interest in learning the chemistry of baking.      Good luck!"
Baking,3dimc9,grundlesmoochers,3,Fri Jul 17 05:02:46 2015 UTC,Your real talk is very much appreciated. I actually enjoy the repetitive tasks. I sometimes have to do repetitive tasks at work and I find it therapeutic. Though I wouldn't know about 12 hours straight of it. I think I would kind of love it. And I'm all down for the physically taxing work. It'll help me stay in shape better than a desk job!   Thanks so much for the advice. I'll keep it all in mind.
Baking,3dimc9,SourCreamTogepi,4,Fri Jul 17 07:18:19 2015 UTC,"I am completely self taught in pastries and cake decorating. I spent my whole childhood reading, practicing, and learning how to do everything I know. When I was 18, I took a portfolio of my cakes and brought it to the manager of this local bakery and asked if they had a position available that I could apply for. She looked at my portfolio and hired me right on the spot. She started me out baking, icing, and decorating king cakes(I'm from Cajun country) and within a week she moved me straight to decorating the custom cake orders. What I'm trying to say is just go in with a portfolio, talk to them, and present confidence in yourself. Let them know you are willing to learn whatever positions they might need help in. I now work as a decorator for MDBS(military deli and bakery services) which is going to further help me get an even better bakery job once I'm back home."

I've transported frosted (but not decorated) cakes for about 5 hours in the car with no real issues.  I baked the cakes and filled them, then wrapped in plastic wrap, then foil and froze).  Make your buttercream and put it in a separate container (I've just used tupperware-type) and freeze that as well.  Put it in the cooler, and make sure nothing is on top of the cake.  Use ice packs (not ice--it will melt and you could end up with soggy cake!).  Frost when you get to your destination."

Baking,3djnnm,tgoddess,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:15:15 2015 UTC,"Not at all.  Just make sure you wrap it up tightly in plastic wrap and then tightly in foil.  I've kept cakes that way for up to two weeks and they've been perfectly fine.  One note, don't fill it with anything like fresh fruit.  Preserves or more buttercream should be fine, but fresh fruit will leech out too much moisture and make your cake soggy when it thaws."

Baking,3djnnm,DondeT,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:30:10 2015 UTC,"Since it's only two days, it should be fine, wrapped up.  The only issue might be your buttercream (depending on what kind you make) if the weather is warm (for food safety reasons, you don't want to leave butter un-refrigerated).  One way around it is to make vegan/non-dairy American buttercream.  Then it should be fine.  Though you will still want to keep that somewhere where it won't get melty...this means someplace that will be at least 72 degrees or cooler.  If you're going to be someplace where temps are going to be over 80 degrees, there's not much you can do to keep the fat from melting in your buttercream (but at least a vegan/non-dairy would be more safe)."

Then, you can see about bitterness or whathaveyou.   I love a chocolate earl grey baked good, where you can use a stronger brew. But, a frosting is plenty sweet enough to hold up to the flavor.

Baking,3dhzpp,DondeT,2,Thu Jul 16 15:55:36 2015 UTC,"I can't see a regular short crust working in the microwave because it would end up just melting the fat in the dough and it wouldn't ever actually brown, so you'll end up with a tough, doughy mess.  Do you have access to a stove-top burner?  If so, you could actually do a makeshift ""oven"" using foil and a skillet with a lid (I can send instructions, if you're interested in that)."
Baking,3dhzpp,tgoddess,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:16:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Yes, I do have access to a stove-top burner so that would be great if you could share your suggestions. I just don't have a regular oven. I did think of buying the pre made ones as DondeT suggested and just making 'cold' pies. But I saw a couple of 'microwave' recipes for crust and my fear is exactly what you said, they wouldn't get golden brown and likely be soggy. So I've been trying to think of alternatives so I can at least try something on occasion."
Baking,3dhzpp,tgoddess,2,Fri Jul 17 10:53:02 2015 UTC,"I've played with the apple pie as suggested in the recipe for this crust, but will work pretty well with any fruit, as long as you cook it first.  This method really only will work with a single crust fruit pie, but I did it with peach and did a crumble on top and that worked fine.  http://www.instructables.com/id/Stove-top-Mini-Apple-Pie/step3/Make-the-crust/  Good luck!  I think I'd just throw myself out a window if I didn't have my oven.  Have you considered trying to find a used toaster oven in the interim?  You could probably find an inexpensive one on Craigslist or at a garage sale..."

Baking,3dge8m,Chizbang,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:15:47 2015 UTC,"Here is the recipe /u/Chizbang.    2 cups of flour 2 tablespoons of baking powder 1 teaspoon of salt 1/4 cup of shortening or butter (Shortening is the less healthy, more crispy delicious)  3/4 cup milk   This is the base dough that you use for the biscuits. Use a pastry knife to cut the shortening into the dry ingredients - you want to have a flaky texture to the dough - then do the same for the milk (using a fork is a little easier) untill the dough forms a ball and no longer sticks to the side of the bowl. Empty the dough onto a floured area and kneed untill the dough is smooth.   Roll the dough out using a rolling pin into a larger # by smaller # rectangle. You want the dough to be about 1/4 inch or 0.5 cm. Really its up to you, I prefer the dough being thicker which makes it fluffier, or you can roll it thinner for a more crispy result.   Once you have your dough flattened, you can  begin to prep the filling   a lot of room tempurature butter a lot of brown sugar a lot less cinnamon    First you want to cover the whole surface of the dough in a layer of butter. Using a scraper helps to make a uniform layer of butter. This is the part where its all by feel, and calorie count. Once you feel you have enough butter, get your brown sugar and using your hands, crumble it over the buttered surface. Make sure you don't neglect the edges. This layer should be thicker, and if you ever question whether or not it's enough, it is most defiantly not enough. Once you feel satisfied with your mound of sugar, evenly sprinkle the cinnamon all over. Not too much, but enough to add colour to the surface.   Now the dough is ready for rolling. Along the longest side, begin rolling the edges into themselves. Make sure your roll is tight because this will be keeping it together. This should form a nice long log. Take your very sharp knife and cut them into inch to two inch thick biscuits. Should be about 12. Next, place them in a lightly oiled muffin tin. Preferably one that fits a dozen. Then to not waste any of your effort, collect any sugar or cinnamon that may be left on the table and place it in the cups that hold the ends. The ends may look jagged and scraggly but they are by far the tastiest - this is just a helping hand - and then you are done!   Cooking temp is 450 degrees Fahrenheit, and cook for approximately 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden and caramelized. Do not over cook. Let them rest before you try taking them out of the tin, they will most likely fall apart due to deliciousness."

That could most certainly determine the outcome of your frosting.   I prefer italian buttercream. Which is made by cooking sugar and adding it to a meringue. Then adding flavoring and butter. I prefer it because it is very stable, it always turns out the same, its very predictable as long as you follow the recipe. It's smooth and easy to work with, holds flavor and/or coloring well also. And you can not over mix it. I will share my recipe with you if you'd like to try it."

Baking,3dg0rq,Cow_of_Doom,2,Thu Jul 16 02:29:50 2015 UTC,"The recipe I use is 16oz. Sugar 4oz water -in a sauce pan together, with a candy thermometer  8oz egg whites -in a stand mixer is easiest  1Tbsp vanilla or more if pain vanilla 1tsp. Lemon juice  24oz butter (unsalted, softened)  Directions: Cook sugar to 245°F. While sugar is cooking (once it reaches 200) start whipping your egg whites. You'll want them at a soft peak when the sugar has reached temp. Turn the mixer to a slow but steady speed. And SLOWLY add the sugar (it will fry the egg whites if the first addition isn't a small bit at a time; you want to temper them) then once your bowl is hot, you can pour a bit faster, but still not the whole pot at once.  Let it mix for a while, for it to cool down a bit (I use this time to unwrap and cut up my butter, as it is impossible to over mix the egg whites once the sugar is added properly, because the egg whites are cooked)  Add vanilla and lemon juice to help it cool down some more.   Once the mixture is cool, add butter in small chunks. Until incorporated. (There will be a point close to the end where it will look like the butter is curtailing and looks over mixed, just add all the butter, and it will finish shiny and smooth)   Another note, it's almost impossible to ruin the frosting once the sugar is added to the egg whites(as long as you don't fry the egg whites), if you add the butter before its totally cooled it turns liquidity. But just add all the butter, add it will whip back to life!"

Baking,3d8ym1,bakingobsessed,3,Tue Jul 14 12:53:29 2015 UTC,"Salted Caramel Chocolate Mudslide Cupcakes: Chocolate Cupcakes -  * 350g plain flour, 60g cocoa powder, 370g caster sugar, 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda, pinch of salt, 150g chocolate chips, 3 large eggs, 240ml cooled coffee, 240ml/g buttermilk, 210ml vegetable oil, Half batch of Salted Caramel  (about 150ml)  Salted Caramel Frosting -  300g unsalted butter (soft) 540g icing sugar (sifted) the other half of the Salted Caramel (150ml)  Mix together the flour, cocoa, sugar, bicarbonate of soda, salt and chocoalte chips. Mix the eggs, coffee, buttermilk and oil together. combine the two mixes. Pour into cases and bake at 150C for 22minutes. This makes 24 cupcakes. Once cool, make a whole and fill with the salted caramel.   Buttercream - beat together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy and then add the salted caramel.  I used the below recipe for the salted caramel but you could buy some.  1 cup Double cream 1 tsp Vanilla Extract 6 tbsp Water 1 cup Caster sugar.  Heat the sugar and water until it starts to caramel and keep heating until it goes a deep amber colour, the darker the caramel the richer the flavour. However if it gets too dark it will taste bitter. Add the double cream and whisk in. Add as much salt as you like, about a teaspoon was enough for me."

Baking,3dafyz,groovesbaby,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:18:11 2015 UTC,"I hate hate hate working with the mass amount of red food coloring that it takes to make red velvet cupcakes (I always accidently dye something) - so everytime I make red velvet, I doctor a cake mix.  Here's how: Take a standard 15.xx oz box of red velvet cake mix and mix with 3 eggs, 3/4 cup sour cream, 3/4 cup oil, 1 3.xx oz (smaller size) package of instant chocolate pudding, 1/2 cup of water and 1tsp vanilla extract.   Frosting is a simple cream cheese frosting made with 16 oz cream cheese, 1.5 sticks butter (3/4 cup), 2-3tsp vanilla bean paste, and about 4-5 cups powdered sugar.   When making red velvet cupcakes, I always tear up a baked cupcake, let it dry out a bit, and use as garnish."

Baking,3daz40,kmrse95,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:37:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what they did on cupcake wars but it sounds like they might've infused the milk with the popcorn. You can do this with just about anything. You add your chosen ingredient (popcorn) to the milk, heat it up to a simmer and then let it steep in the milk for 30 minutes or so, then strain the contents and you have flavored milk. I know there's lots of popular recipes that do this with cereals to make cereal flavored ice cream and such. I've used this method before with different nuts to make almond and hazelnut buttercreams. Hope this helps."

Baking,3d5x3z,Spacecrafts,8,Mon Jul 13 19:49:53 2015 UTC,I used my favorite chocolate cupcake recipe and pushed a frozen reeses cup in the batter before baking.   Topped with a peanut butter buttercream http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/84429/fluffy-peanut-butter-frosting/
Baking,3d5x3z,strawberryswing1,2,Mon Jul 13 19:52:06 2015 UTC,A regular sized Reese's?
Baking,3d5x3z,strawberryswing1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:19:53 2015 UTC,Nope! One of the smaller mini sized. Though you could probably do a regular sized reeses with less cupcake batter and have a very peanut butter-ey cupcake. Which sounds delicious. I may try if it fits!
Baking,3d5x3z,katiedoodles8,3,Tue Jul 14 09:35:35 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'll definitely have to try these with Justin's peanut butter cups. So much better than Reese's! Also I wanted to share a pic of my creation: http://imgur.com/KfMKdOB :D"

Baking,3d5x3z,legs2yaya,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:07:41 2015 UTC,Haha I would probably love them more with the bigger size too. PEANUT BUTTER ALL DAY!

Baking,3d7ehi,urmuh,2,Tue Jul 14 04:46:34 2015 UTC,Then one more question.  Was that just a basic icing on the doughnut?
Baking,3d7ehi,urmuh,2,Tue Jul 14 04:50:03 2015 UTC,Pretty much. Just 1/4 cup milk 2 cups powdered sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla whisked together in a sauce pan over medium low heat to keep it from setting while I was dipping them.  I was too concerned with getting high altitude baking techniques right to think of making a better icing ahead of time. Truth be told these are the first things I've baked since I got to Denver that came out just right.
Baking,3db7q1,lunixia,2,Tue Jul 14 22:39:57 2015 UTC,"This is my favorite recipe: http://thebakingpan.com/recipes/cakes/chocolate-buttermilk-cake/  It makes quite a bit of batter so I always bake it in three 9"" pans. Hershey's 'black out' cake is similar but yields less batter. I prefer chocolate cakes that incorporate coffee because chocolate cakes made without it just taste flat to me. I also like to use Hershey's ""Special Dark"" cocoa. Lastly, if you do choose a recipe with coffee, it typically makes a very runny batter so be sure to line your pan with parchment otherwise there's a big risk of the cake sticking, no matter how much you grease it. Good luck!"

Baking,3db7q1,Dani_Bakes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:12:50 2015 UTC,"I've never used decaffeinated but I'm sure it would be perfectly fine. The coffee flavor adds an extra dimension to the chocolate cake...it doesn't make it taste like coffee, it just makes it tastes better and more chocolate-y, if that makes sense."

Baking,3d5qwi,Lcllccccc,14,Mon Jul 13 19:07:04 2015 UTC,"In the video it looks like they are rolled a little off center, so the middle is already raised. It does look like you had plenty of space for them to expand in your ramekins, so I'm not worried about that. Maybe roll them a little less tightly? In my experience puff pastry needs space to work.  Are you confident with your oven temperature? do you have an oven thermometer? You might be running a little cool.  Next time, if they don't look finished in the middle, you could always make a little foil cuff to protect the outside and put them back in for another 5 minutes, to let the center finish.  They are still ridiculously pretty!"
Baking,3d5qwi,vohrtex,5,Mon Jul 13 21:29:17 2015 UTC,"Solid advice, thank you! I just moved to a new apartment and the oven here is very old-fashioned, with just the options for either heat from the top or the bottom (versus heat from top AND bottom in modern ones). So I'm still trying to figure out the temperature setting. I'll definitely try the foil trick next time!"

A while ago I too made some cute little apple roses and posted them on reddit (I'm on mobile so I can't link them, just look in my post history) including a recipe in how I made them.

Baking,3d5qwi,YMK1234,2,Mon Jul 13 21:48:41 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'm guessing the reason that it doesn't cook through in the middle is because the whole rose is too big (as I am greedy and want more layers to make it prettier). I'll try making smaller ones like yours next time :)

Baking,3d2rj7,soccermomjane,3,Mon Jul 13 14:35:51 2015 UTC,"Google does not have much to offer-I found a few posts but none explained it so I did the next best thing, I pulled some classic cookbooks off my shelf and searched for a detailed explanation.  According to The Fannie Farmer Baking Book (Alfred A. Knopf, 1984) on page 142, a translucent filling is actually a type of custard, a baked mixture thickend with eggs, but containing no milk-only large amounts of sugar (or corn syrup, maple syrup, or molasses), eggs, butter and some flavoring.  It goes on to list Pecan pie as the most popular.  However, Joy of Cooking, (Bobbs-Merrill Co., 1975) refers to them as transparent pies and defines them as based on brown sugar, molasses, and corn or maple syrup.  These are thickened usually with egg but sometimes with a crumb mixture (Shoo Fly Pie) or with a flour base.  Some cut the sweetness with tart jelly, lemon or vinegar.  Some add butter or cream, spices, nuts and dried fruit.  The explanation goes further to explain that some of the pie recipes claim Southern, Pennsylvania and even English descent.  So what exactly is a translucent/transparent pie?  Think Pecan, Chess, Derby, Lemon Meringue, Banbury Tarts.  Hope this explanation helps and if you do not have a copy of either of these books, try and pick one up the next time you visit a used book or thrift store-well worth the money for the information and historical context they contain."

Baking,3d31kh,ToadLord,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:19:20 2015 UTC,What season is it where you live? Do you measure your flour by volume (measuring cup) or by weight?   In the summer when it is humid flour will absorb more moisture just from the air than it will in the winter when it is low humidity.  One cup of flour will have different weight summer or winter.    I would make a small batch of something and play with the flour measurement.

If making the chocolate replace the extra 3 T of flour with good cocoa powder and the water with coffee. Works good as layers or cupcakes.

Baking,3d30d5,SecretNameIsSecret,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:59:25 2015 UTC,"custards and curds are pretty easy. just keep whisking the whole time, and if you're really worried about scrambled eggs, you can make it over a double boiler. the main thing for a newbie would probably be to make them over a low temperature. it will take longer, but it's the safest way. Also, you can put it through a sieve if you screw it up and it will take out the chunks.  If you throw some lemon juice over your bananas it will keep them yellow for longer. Also I think they make banana flavored pudding if you want to take the easy way with that.  As long as you don't use too much of the custard inside I don't see it causing much of an issue (provided it's not a five layer cake or anything). Your supports should be able to keep everything in check. You could also just keep it on the side and serve it as a garnish if you're stressing about it."

Baking,3d30d5,Dani_Bakes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:58:48 2015 UTC,"Most custard recipes call for tempering the eggs before being added to the hot milk/cream mixture so if you use that method it should greatly reduce any risk for scrambling the eggs.  If you're concerned about the bananas getting brown, why not practice making a batch (or half batch) of the custard and then add sliced bananas to it and then check it the next day to see if the bananas are still okay? Or try the lemon juice like cat_pix suggested and leave the banana slices out so you can see how long it will take them to brown.  As for making sure the filling stays put, I almost always take my leftover cake scraps (from leveling the cake) and mix them with frosting to make a thick batter and I use that to create a dam for my filling. I find it to be a little more stable than just using frosting, and I also just prefer not having a thick ridge of frosting. However, if you choose the frosting dam route, just add extra powdered sugar to the dam frosting to make it extra thick. You really shouldn't have any trouble, especially since you won't be transporting it!  Your order looks good. I ALWAYS bake and freeze the cake ahead of time. Good luck!"

Baking,3cyqgo,ireadwords,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:27:37 2015 UTC,"It's going to be weird. I'm assuming the thick pan would act like a heat sink, delaying the heat reaching the dough at the bottom of the pan while the top is heated straight away. Theoretically it should balance out as it'd continue heating the dish until it's cooled down longer than a thin pan, but because you only take it out when it's done (and thus want to take it out of the pan to avoid overcooking and cool better) you basically cook the top longer than the rest of the bread.   As such I'm thinking that despite what you would expect, the thicker the pan, the more uneven the bread is cooked (assuming your oven does not have massive heat discrepancies), though that does seem to be the aim in the recipe."

Baking,3cw2qb,BladeR21,7,Sat Jul 11 06:49:55 2015 UTC,"I'm on mobile so had troubles editing imgur but we have the following:  Most of these recipes are from old cookbooks and magazines I've taken from my mother's collection over the years. I bake often and should have been sharing with this sub much earlier. I make complicated, more visually appealing recipes time to time, but my favorite activity is finding recipes from all over that taste very good and are easy to make.   I use these recipes to get a lot of my friends interested in baking. It gives them an opportunity to learn without things being overly complicated.  To be completed: Remainder of recipes will be added. Formatting will be fixed.  Also, if you're interested I've made tres Leche cakes I learned in Mexico and cheesecakes earlier in May if you'd like those too!  Magic Cookie Bars  Old Eagle Brand Recipe Book  Ingredients   1/2 cup butter 1.5 cups Graham Cracker Crumbs 1 (14oz) can of Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk 1 cup (6oz) semi-sweet chocolate morsels 1 (3.5oz) can flaked coconut (1.5 cups) 1 cup chopped nuts (pecans or walnuts)   I personally love using cinnamon graham crackers and pecans.  Directions   Preheat oven to 350 deg F (325 for glass) in 13x9 baking pan melt butter in oven sprinkle crumbs evenly over butter and press lightly pour condensed milk evenly over crumbs Top with remaining ingredients and press down firmly bake 25-30 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool. Taste great chilled or at room temp   Carrot Cake  I located the same recipe online, so I'm just going to share the link.   Cake:http://allrecipes.com/recipe/moist-carrot-cake/ Frosting:http://allrecipes.com/recipe/cream-cheese-frosting-ii/   Streusel bars  I don't remember what book this came from. I took a picture of the recipe on my phone when I was at home.  Ingredients   3/4 cup butter, melted 2.5 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 cup powdered sugar 1 jar (10-12 oz) jam 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 cup nuts, chopped FROSTING: See carrot cake recipe   I changed the recipe slightly. I didn't like the cream cheese frosting they included so replaced with my go-to I linked in the carrot cake recipe (I like vanilla). Also they recommend 12 oz seedless raspberry jam. If you buy a nicer quality jam, I use 10oz fine and it's not too little jam. Tastes great with raspberry, triple berry, strawberry, and orange marmalade. Orange marmalade does get slightly acidic longer they go without eating. Notice I split flour into two amounts. That's explained below.  Directions   Preheat oven to 350 deg F (325 for glass) Mix melted butter, flour, and powdered sugar until crumbly in a large bowl Reserve 1/4 cup for later use and pour the rest into a 9x13 bar pan or baking pan. Press or roll to an even thickness Mix Jam and the 3/4 cup of flour together in medium bowl until smooth. Spread over crust Make the cream cheese frosting and pipe diagonal stripes over the jam layer sprinkle evenly the remaining 1/4 of crumble and nuts over topping bake 30-35 minutes or until edges are light golden brown. let cool completely.

Then sprinkled dried thyme when it came out of the oven. Perfect for breakfast, brunch or a snack!"
Baking,3cxthf,guyinnova,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:13:27 2015 UTC,"You likely didn't do anything wrong...sometimes recipes just don't turn out but the upside is you usually learn something from it, like next time you'll probably want to use a recipe that pre-cooks the filling a little bit. I made a blueberry cobbler the other day that didn't require any pre-cooking and the filling ingredients were similar to your recipe except it also included lemon juice, so maybe adding some extra moisture with cornstarch would've helped break down the berries more? Also, sometimes fresh blueberries can be quite large so it takes longer time in the oven for them to ""pop"" and release their own juices. I had to bake my cobbler longer than the time called for until it started to bubble/liquify. I hope when you finally cut it and eat it that it'll have turned out better than you think! Side note: I love allrecipes.com but it's usually helpful to read a lot of the comments on the recipes because people who are rating the recipe often times change the recipe to make it better but still give the recipe 5 stars. It can be confusing. Anyhow, I noticed some of the commenters tweaked the recipe for the pie."
Baking,3cxthf,Dani_Bakes,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:17:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i would probably have cooked the filling a bit first. It takes very little effort and makes all the difference in making a uniformly thick and flavorful filling. I would just throw all the ingredients in a pan (minus the cornstarch) and cook it for just a few minutes until the blueberries turn dark and the liquid starts to release. I would then add a cornstarch slurry until your desired thickness it attained.   Also, i agree with the above post about lemon juice. Whenever I cook with fruit I find that the acidity of lemon really brightens up the fruit without changing the flavors very much."

I didn't even tried to replicate it, instead tried an easier version. It came very well and fluffy!   Recipe for interested:  250g Strong White flour; 30g caster sugar; 2 eggs large +1 for the glaze; 2 tbps cold water; 1/2 tsp salt; 3/2 tsp fast action yeast; 125g softened warm butter;  Directions:  Mix everything together. It's sticky, better with a mixer Knead 15/20 minutes by hand; I don't have a mixer :( ; Put in a bowl, cover, rest 1h in warm room. Rest in fridge 2h. Divide into 3 balls, flatten each of them and fold in the centre to form a spine. Put in 2lb bread tin and let rise 3 hours in warm room. Glaze with one egg on top. Cook at 180°C for 35-40 minutes WITH A BAKING SHEET on a shelf near the top of the bread to avoid burning the top.  The result is very soft, many appreciate that but I don't. I'll try to make something denser, more buttery, with cinnamon, raisins and nuts.  [Edit - formatting]"

Bake as directed for a prebake.   Top with your favorite brownie recipe - I choose more of a bittersweet fudgy brownie to offset the sweet marshmallows. Bake brownies as normal.  When the brownies are done, top with mini marshmallows and place under your oven broiler for about a minute. (watch these very closely - it browns very fast)"

Baking,3cu2j8,YMK1234,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:53:57 2015 UTC,"Background: my grandma made great walnut cake and so today I gave it a shot (She's not dead, I am just too lazy to call her and put up with the old people talk). She made hers in a Gugelhupf shape so thats why I used the ring shape.   Procedure: I pretty much ""winged it"" based on a very rough recipe my sister gave me. Just your everyday basics: fat (margarine), sugar, eggs, vanilla, flour, baking powder, and a little water (because I forgot the milk), and then toss in the ground nuts with it all and bake for 45 mins at 180°C.  Outcome: quite nice actually, most parts are like I like them, i.e. a slight crust, very fluffy interior, and great taste. However the interior, while being very nice and fluffy, is also quite dry which is the only downside (and you can remedy that with coffee and milk, right? :D)  EDIT: next time I'm gonna try to reproduce this recipe while making the dough a little more moist by adding more liquid into it. Also I just realize I forgot to add the pinch of salt and rum which I wanted to do :/"

Baking,3cmiis,Maya3778,2,Thu Jul 9 11:53:49 2015 UTC,Adorable! Where did you get your cookie cutter?
Baking,3crod9,cyster_cyster,3,Fri Jul 10 05:52:17 2015 UTC,"depending on what you're baking, the temperature would likely be the same, it's just the cooking time you would reduce."
Baking,3crod9,PM_ME_CAT_PIX,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:56:23 2015 UTC,"Same temp, minimal reduction for baking times if any.  A website for small-batch baking like www.dessertfortwo.com/ may be helpful for you. Even if you use your own recipes, you can compare to similar recipes and use that to guide your own baking changes."
Baking,3cohfm,BabyJ,18,Thu Jul 9 14:29:37 2015 UTC,"I personally wouldn't, just because of the texture issue. What I have done before is made an extract with fresh mint and alcohol (I used bourbon for mint julep-flavoured bundt cake) and it turned out pretty well!"
Baking,3cohfm,DuckfatPopcorn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:13:37 2015 UTC,"Same, except I use vodka for a more generic mint extract since vodka alone is fairly tasteless."
Baking,3cohfm,GraveMercy,10,Thu Jul 9 19:00:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not sure if directly putting in fresh mint will work. I would try seeping the mint in milk to add to the mix or make a ganache for frosting the brownies. You won't loose the incredible fresh mint flavor!"
Baking,3cohfm,elle_es,3,Thu Jul 9 15:51:12 2015 UTC,"Do you have a specific recipe you are following (is it scratch or boxed)?  I'd try probably melting down the butter, adding the mint and let it sit for a while to take on the mint flavor.  Then strain the mint leaves from the butter and just use the now-mint-flavored butter."
Baking,3cohfm,chirp16,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:35:02 2015 UTC,It's from scratch and the fat in the recipe is vegetable oil. Interesting idea!
Baking,3cohfm,chirp16,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:39:15 2015 UTC,do you melt chocolate for your recipe or just use cocoa powder?  You could also maybe melt the chocolate with the mint leaves and infuse it that way
Baking,3cohfm,FeastOnCarolina,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:41:22 2015 UTC,Cocoa powder :/
Baking,3cohfm,chirp16,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:00:31 2015 UTC,Making a mint extract like above with alcohol would give better flavor since it'll absorb more flavor compounds than fat.
Baking,3cohfm,kalayna,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:07:07 2015 UTC,good idea!
Baking,3cohfm,kalayna,2,Thu Jul 9 22:22:16 2015 UTC,"As mentioned, chopping will lead to odd texture issues. That being said, tossing those roughly chopped leaves into a food processor with your granulated sugar would probably work. :)"

I just googled and found an R Bakery in Mississauga (Canada) - is that the one you saw?  If so, it seems to be a small independent operation.  If not, then at least two separate bakeries have the same name and manage to co-exist in separate countries!  My own vote is for Bekari.  Just Bekari, no R.  I like it!"

Baking,3cqxm1,butteryoatmeal,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:23:21 2015 UTC,I made them from scratch. I used this recipe http://www.sophisticatedgourmet.com/2009/10/new-york-style-bagel-recipe/  They came out so good but eventually got really hard
Baking,3cqxm1,butteryoatmeal,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:47:42 2015 UTC,"Okay, that's a start.  You used exactly the ingredients stated, not some other kind of flour?  Did you follow the measurements and method exactly or did you take a few liberties?  How experienced are you at baking?  Did you let them rest for as long as the recipe states?  Did you boil them before baking?  Everything is important so if you really want to troubleshoot this, we need all the info.    I trained for pastry, not breads so much, but I've made plenty of bagels in my life.  I'd really like to figure this out with you for the sake of my own curiosity as well."
Baking,3cqxm1,Poppycorn,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:58:50 2015 UTC,I used all purpose flout everything else was exactly off the list
Baking,3cqxm1,Poppycorn,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:14:46 2015 UTC,"And your method was the same as the directions there?  Using other than high gluten flour will produce a soft bagel less ability to hold air in the dough.  If you overbaked these at all, for example in an oven that was not really hot enough, you would end up with just some soft ""almost""-bagels.  They wouldn't have the texture of a real bagel.    Are you sure you used enough water in the dough?  Enough yeast?  And you observed all the times and temperatures?  Did you cover the bagels with a towel after baking?    I didn't see it mentioned in the recipe but if you add maltose to the boiling water, you will have a nicer result.  Just fyi."
Baking,3cqxm1,Poppycorn,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:28:35 2015 UTC,"I make bagels most days at work (I'm a baker; I do pastries and breads).    The major difference I see in the recipe you posted and the one I use is the lack of diastatic malt powder and barley malt syrup in the recipe you used. (the powder in the dough, the syrup in the boiling pot).  I also let my bagels retard overnight in the fridge prior to boiling and baking and don't let them rise before forming them. I am not sure why they are so hard... Perhaps the lower temp/longer cooking time? (I do mine @500*F for 10ish minutes.) Anyway, I digress....    Let me know if you have any questions or want to try a different recipe :)"

If you like to bake bread, the 450w is a no brainer.   edit:Someone pointed out in /r/breddit, that if you do like baking denser bread,  may want to consider the stronger professional 600 with the 575w motor. https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/3cl000/target_has_a_kitchen_aid_5qt_pro_on_sale_for_200/cswp02x"

It’s a chocolate and raspberry cake inspired by Heston Blumenthal’s Black Forest gateau recipe (excellent write-up available here).  From bottom to top, the layers are:   Madeleine biscuit base Flourless chocolate sponge Raspberries and ganache Flourless chocolate sponge Chambord cream   Crucially, each layer that required baking needed to be as thin as possible owing to a particularly bad oven in my current house. The biscuit base turned out great and I was just able to pull off the flourless sponge.  This is my first attempt at icing a cake so please excuse the fact the finish is a bit amateurish. I'm hopeful that the taste will make up for the appearance. Can’t wait to cut into it tomorrow and see all those layers!"

Baking,3clvbw,Sasharan,6,Wed Jul 8 22:38:35 2015 UTC,"I typically like to bake cakes from scratch but whenever someone requests a rainbow cake I prefer to use a boxed vanilla or white cake mix. Something about adding tons of food dye to batter made with quality/expensive ingredients like real butter is unappealing to me. I have done it with a scratch vanilla cake recipe before but one issue that I ran into is that when you are adding the dye to the batter you have to keep stirring the batter/adding more dye/stirring the batter until you get the shade you want and the more you mix the batter after adding the dry ingredients, the tougher the cake will be. Cake mixes are much more forgiving in that department. If you decide to bake from scratch, using a cake recipe with a 'reverse creaming' method will cut down on gluten formation when having to stir a lot.  As for the dome on the cake, a cake mix will definitely increase your chance for a dome. To minimize this, bake the cake 25 degrees lower than the recipe calls for (I've even started a cake at 325F and reduced it to 300F during baking to get a more even top). However, if you want a perfectly flat top, you'll have to level the cake with a knife or cake leveler."
Baking,3clvbw,Dani_Bakes,2,Wed Jul 8 23:57:59 2015 UTC,"i like to use my standard cake recipe which is a box mix (in this case, white) + stated ingredients + 1 cup sour cream + 1 small box vanilla pudding mix, i bake at 320* instead of 350* and just increase the baking time. i have a cake leveler that was like $3 at walmart and it works perfectly for easy leveling of cakes, but they come out pretty flat already."
Baking,3clvbw,jennafezz,2,Thu Jul 9 08:11:55 2015 UTC,"I love the cake pan strips for keeping cakes flat, regardless which recipe I'm working with.

Baking,3cls2q,goku4thewin,5,Wed Jul 8 22:13:19 2015 UTC,"Looks yummy!  I'm guessing that the ridge around the outside just means you cooled it too fast and the center fell, since there is a slight crack on the left. What I do to combat this is to turn the oven off when it is done baking, but leave it in the oven and ever-so-slightly prop the door open so heat can slowly escape."
Baking,3cls2q,43r0,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:04:23 2015 UTC,I did take it out right after baking. Lesson learned. Thanks for the info.
Baking,3cls2q,sayswut,2,Thu Jul 9 01:24:17 2015 UTC,"I also use a sharp knife and run it around the edges before putting it back in the oven to cool, to stop the sides sticking to the pan as the rest of the cake sinks."
Baking,3cls2q,Dani_Bakes,2,Thu Jul 9 09:11:12 2015 UTC,"The ridge looks like your oven might be running a little bit hot, causing the cheesecake to rise quickly when first being placed in the oven and then falling when you take it out. It also looks like you used a dark coated pan and those tend heat quicker (and hold heat better) than light coated pans so it's usually suggested to reduce the temperature of the oven by 25 degrees when using a dark coated pan (unless, of course, you want a darker crust). Did you use a water bath? Water baths will cook the cheesecake evenly and help prevent it from falling and cracking when it's removed from the oven. Did you like the taste/texture of it? That's the most important factor to consider because you can always add a sourcream frosting or fruit to the top to cover up any imperfections! Yum."
Baking,3cls2q,LyricGale,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:14:05 2015 UTC,"I was gonna use a water bath but didn't have a pan big enough to fit the 9"" round in it. I have yet to taste it because I wanted it to cool and I'm making a strawberry citrus compote to put over it. Thanks for the insight!  Edit:  The consistency wasn't the fluffiest. I would contribute to the fast cool down, right? But overall the taste is very good. On the next one I will do what I can for a water bath and let it cool slowly. The compote was rather delicious as well, I might add."
Baking,3cls2q,Dani_Bakes,2,Thu Jul 9 01:26:01 2015 UTC,I've used a disposable aluminum turkey roaster for my cheesecakes before.  The trick then is to get the sucker out of the water bath without scorching oneself.  I got a set of full hand silicone mitts.
Baking,3cls2q,SlamielTosh,2,Thu Jul 9 07:22:23 2015 UTC,"I use this recipe from Dorie Greenspan: http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/perfect_cheesecake/ It might be a little more time consuming than some other recipes but the water bath, low(er) cooking temperature, and letting it sit in the water bath for an hour after it's done has resulted in crack-free and super creamy cheesecake for me. If you're into a denser type of cheesecake, then this recipe might not be for you. Also seconding the idea on disposable aluminum roasting pan. Make sure to use the heavy duty alumnum foil if you decide to do a water bath. Good thing about cheesecake is that no matter how it turns out, it usually still tastes delicious."
Baking,3cls2q,Dani_Bakes,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:18:19 2015 UTC,"Newbie here, what's a water bath? And what purpose does it serve? Thanks in advance :)"
Baking,3cls2q,SlamielTosh,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:55:41 2015 UTC,A water bath is when you place the cheesecake pan (wrapped very tightly in tin foil) into a roasting pan and add hot water to the roasting pan. The cheesecake cooks in the oven this way. The water bath allows the cheesecake to cook in a very moist oven which promotes even cooking and helps reduce the chance for cracks. There are videos on youtube that show exactly how it's done. :-)
Baking,3cgged,CoriCelesti,3,Tue Jul 7 18:45:24 2015 UTC,"Here's a photo of the inside. Sadly, I didn't put enough raspberry so it soaked into the cake and isn't very visible. Also, sorry for poor lighting.  Bonus cupcakes with leftover batter and whipped ganache.  This was my first time making a chocolate cake from scratch, slicing a cake to fill (alas, only had one springform pan for baking), and making ganache. I decided to have some fun with it for my birthday and am quite happy with how it turned out.  The cake recipe I used is from here. The only thing I altered was adding 1 tsp instant coffee granules to the boiling water. I also had to bake it an extra 10 minutes because I used 2/3 of the batter in one springform pan.  The raspberry filling is really just jam. Okay, I cheated on that. But I didn't have any raspberries around and it was my birthday so I can cheat, okay?  The ganache was super easy. I chopped up 4 oz semi-sweet baking chocolate and combined it with 4oz dark chocolate chips (it was what I had on hand), then microwaved 1 cup of heavy cream until it was quite warm and poured over the chocolate. I stirred until combined. After twice putting it in the fridge to thicken and getting impatient, I ended up nestling the bowl in my chest freezer and stirring it until it thickened enough to coat the cake with, which was also chilled. After this, I put the ganache back in the freezer for 10 minutes and whipped it to form the fluffy lighter coloured frosting for garnish and bonus cupcakes.  It turned out really yummy and my husband said it tasted professional, so I'm quite pleased. :)"
Baking,3cgged,MiserableLie,2,Tue Jul 7 18:54:26 2015 UTC,"This looks great, and thanks for posting the ganache recipe. I need to do something similar tomorrow and was concerned about the correct proportions of chocolate and cream for a good spreading consistency so you've put my mind at ease!"
Baking,3cgged,boggle_legend,2,Tue Jul 7 20:59:53 2015 UTC,"If you have a scale, use it. In general, you want a 1:1 ratio of chocolate to milk. If not, the 8oz to a cup should be about right. Good luck! It's really not as hard as it seems. :)"
Baking,3cgged,boggle_legend,2,Wed Jul 8 01:24:34 2015 UTC,Does the type of chocolate matter for the ganache(i.e. baking or regular chocolate)? It looks perfect on the cake.
Baking,3cgged,mnufat17,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:08:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I believe it does. Considering the ganache is only chocolate and cream, the quality of the chocolate will affect the taste a lot. Chocolate chips aren't made to melt easily, so it took longer for mine to become smooth. I would have used all baking chocolate or high-quality chocolate bars if I had enough on hand, but had to use what I had. Look for the ones with the least ingredients to get the best flavour. :)"

Baking,3ci6yx,Eponia,2,Wed Jul 8 02:38:40 2015 UTC,"Sugar-free baking is fraught with difficulties. I am not diabetic but I have dabbled. My results have been universally disappointing. Sugar doesn't only act as a sweetener in baking, it also serves as a bulking agent. So you can replace the sugar with artificial sweetener, but you still need something else to replace the mass of the sugar. Artificial sweeteners also do not brown like sugar does.   I usually use granulated Splenda to replace sugar in recipes. However, granulated Splenda uses maltodextrin as a bulking agent. Maltodextrin has a higher glycemic index than table sugar and is probably also not suitable for diabetics in the quantities used for baking. It is also not ""0 calories"" as they would have you believe (100 calories per cup). Cakes that I've made this way turn out very dry, with a faintly chemical taste and a top that is kind of hard and crusty but not browned at all.  Pillsbury makes sugar-free cake mixes in at least vanilla and chocolate flavors. I have never tried them but I have relatives that bake them regularly and seem to enjoy them."
Baking,3ci6yx,bernath,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:44:05 2015 UTC,Yeah all that is about what I figured as far as it not just changing the taste but the process.  Have you ever used stevia? Or seen anything about using that in baking?
Baking,3ci6yx,bernath,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:34:23 2015 UTC,Stevia is also heat-stable so you could use that instead of Splenda or whatever. I think the results would be very similar. Personally I find stevia to have a nasty aftertaste so I don't use it very much. The exception being Truvia which is a blend of stevia and erythritol. I have been meaning to try the Truvia baking blend which does not contain maltodextrin but does have some sugar in it. Everything I said about granulated Splenda would also apply to most granulated stevia sweeteners as they use maltodextrin as a bulking agent as well. The liquid versions of these sweeteners don't contain any bulking agents but I think they would compromise the texture of the finished product even more.

Baking,3ci6yx,keto_shuffle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:06:32 2015 UTC,Be careful of what fruits you use to give sweetness to what you make! My great uncle and aunt are diabetic. They don't usually bother buying fruit when they haven't got guests over as they're only allowed 1 banana each a week!
Baking,3ch96y,oanapastry,3,Tue Jul 7 22:07:32 2015 UTC,"Sounds nice. One question though. I'm from England, is powdered sugar, caster or icing sugar? Using the wrong one of those would probably make a big difference to taste and texture!!"
Baking,3ch96y,coriacea,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:07:21 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure powdered sugar is what y'all call icing sugar.
Baking,3ch96y,whiskeygirl,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:28:57 2015 UTC,Icing sugar you can mix with a bit of water to make a thin icing to drizzle over cake. Granulated sugar is what we put in tea and coffee and caster sugar is a finer version of that and baking recipes sometimes tell you to make cakes or biscuits using it but I usually just use granulated sugar.
Baking,3ch96y,coriacea,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:33:09 2015 UTC,"I'd say icing sugar is better. But caster sugar is ok too, just mix the butter and sugar for a bit longer, then add the egg and keep mixing until everything is well incorporated and smooth."

Baking,3cgzjk,GraveMercy,2,Tue Jul 7 20:57:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah it should, because you're keeping the only part of the cupcake that could be exposed to air covered. Which will keep it from drying out. And if you're using a buttercream the butter will seep into the cake a tiny bit. But, It depends how long they're sitting, a few days will definitely make a difference. Try making some and comparing. :)"

I hate when you get a cupcake and there's this two inch-high artistic swirl of icing in the middle and the edges are bare. I want a bit of icing on my whole cupcake and maybe a bit extra in the middle for that last ""extra sweet"" bite and the pretty little swirled peak. I don't want just plain cupcake and then so much icing I can't even taste the cake when I eat the middle. :( Am I supposed to cake a bite of the plain edge and then a bite of the icing mountain? That's kind of weird and inconvenient."

Baking,3ccian,ChiliFlake,7,Mon Jul 6 21:04:37 2015 UTC,"Baking soda requires an acid to activate it - this is usually vinegar, yoghurt or buttermilk. Baking powder is baking soda plus the required acid (basically cream of tartar).    Cocoa powder is also acidic and so some recipes you'll see will call for baking soda. If the recipe calls for 'dutched' cocoa powder then it has been alkilinated, and baking soda won't be sufficient for the raising agent. In this case you'll need to add an acid or use baking powder."

Baking,3ccian,TheBaconDrakon,3,Mon Jul 6 23:21:43 2015 UTC,"I just have a few things to add onto what /u/DondeT said.   Baking soda is stronger than baking powder and reacts as soon as it comes in contact with an acid and a bit more when it's heated. Because baking soda reacts immediately upon contact, things like quickbreads should be baked immediately after mixing. Its alkalinity also helps in browning things.   Baking powder reacts upon contact with moisture, which allows the baking soda and acid in it to react. Most baking powder is also double acting with the initial reaction occurring when it gets wet and the second reaction occurring when it's heated. These two separate reactions give baked goods with baking powder a little more rise, which in turn gives them a lighter flufflier texture.  Source 1 Source 2."
Baking,3ccian,AbeFromanLuvsSausage,3,Mon Jul 6 23:31:41 2015 UTC,"An additional add-on is that if too much of either leavener is used, there will be a bad taste.  Too much baking powder = bitter, too much baking soda = soapy.  Also, sources of acid in baked goods also can include brown sugar, eggs, and cream of tartar.  It is a firm rule that you cannot substitute ""1 for 1"" in a recipe, but you can make your own baking powder easily by using baking soda + cream of tartar (google proportions if you're curious, I can't recall it at the moment)"

Baking,3c9jvv,crazywhisk,2,Tue Jul 7 21:49:56 2015 UTC,"For the caramel filling I used the little wrapped caramels.  They are a PITA to unwrap though.  For both layers of the cake I used 50 caramels and added 1/2c of milk and microwaved for 30 seconds at a time, stirring well each time.  After that was all blended I added 1c of chopped pecans. When you use this as a layer in the cake its a little runny.  But you need it to be otherwise you cannot actually cut the cake.  I suggest piping a dam around the outside with the ganache to contain everything. I just realized that my description of the cake is kind of lacking as to what it really is. Its really a turtle cake."

Baking,3ca9dl,beauxbeaux,7,Mon Jul 6 09:22:47 2015 UTC,"The point is that if you raise the temperature gradually, they will cook uniformly - and either thicken, or set - depending on the recipe. If they cook too quickly the egg proteins will coagulate before the rest of the ingredients have been incorporated - hence the scrambled results.    Method in baking is often crucial and can give drastically different results even when using the same ingredients."

Baking,3ca9dl,mythtaken,2,Mon Jul 6 16:10:47 2015 UTC,"Once you've mixed the eggs into the larger amount of ingredients, most of the time you've still got to be careful not to overheat things.   Low and slow is usually the way to go.   I've been making some ice cream lately, and have had perfectly good results by mixing the eggs in with dairy and sugar all at once, then gently heating the mixture til it thickens. Less risky than trying to bring the dairy to a boil then adding in the eggs,  and it works just as well in this application."

Baking,3c65lc,ashalenko,25,Sun Jul 5 17:39:22 2015 UTC,Where can I actually learn to decorate like this?
Baking,3c65lc,rugtoad,32,Sun Jul 5 10:44:14 2015 UTC,"YouTube and practice. This is all done with royal icing, a cake bag and a few toothpicks (usually).   If you can find a local place that teaches decorating, that'll help.  The part I've always struggled with is getting the royal at the right consistency. You can approach this a number of ways, but ""beginners"" will typically create a batch of thicker royal icing, color it, then take a quarter out of it and thin out the rest. The thick stuff is what you use to border the cookie,the thin stuff to ""flood"" it.   It also takes a tremendous amount of patience and a huge tolerance for mess. After you practice a two or three times, the feeling of having to clean up ten bowls of royal icing will make you want to straight-up cry.   It is fun, but if you aren't going to go all-in with it, you can probably count on not getting to this level without some sort of super-human ability."
Baking,3c65lc,ashalenko,3,Sun Jul 5 12:25:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Any particular tutorials you can recommend? I'm an unco leftie, so super-human ability is definitely out of the question hahah."
Baking,3c65lc,rugtoad,5,Sun Jul 5 13:37:59 2015 UTC,"Been a while, but I think Wilton had a couple of hour-long ones sponsored somewhere, can't seem to find them now though.  Honestly, though...from what I found most of the tutorials are pretty much exactly the same. There are just a number of things you need to practice, because they aren't nearly as easy to do as the videos make them seem.   Royal icing is tricky to work with, it tends to dry quickly so you don't have a lot of time to putz around in the kitchen while you're getting things together (although putting a wet towel over the bowl/bag will mitigate this a bit I've found). And designs like this are super-easy to screw up, and require you to have a dozen bags of icing laying around (meaning you also have to invest a bit in equipment).   The best thing you can do is spend an hour watching various videos and listening for the ""tips"", then just practice for about a thousand hours or so;)"
Baking,3c65lc,Raebandz,4,Sun Jul 5 13:43:44 2015 UTC,Haniela's on youtube! She is great. So many different designs. Plus her sugar cookie recipe is the best/easiest and can be found in every video of her decoration videos.

Baking,3c65lc,RubyGetsNaked,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:35:59 2015 UTC,Royal icing is just a LOT easier to decorate with. It keeps it shape better and the colors come out brighter :)
Baking,3c65lc,twishling,0,Sun Jul 5 16:41:56 2015 UTC,"I've been making them for years and never use egg whites; I use meringue powder instead. There are multiple substitutions you can use for the binding agent, it doesn't need to be eggs, but you'll want some sort of a stabilizer for your royal icing (milk/water is used for consistency, it isn't a binding agent). You can probably omit for flooding icing, but borders, details, gingerbread houses, etc, it helps to have.   EDIT (clarification): my reference of eggs is of raw eggs (:"
Baking,3c65lc,tickif,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:13:55 2015 UTC,"meringue powder is mostly dried egg whites though, so technically you are still using egg whites, just not fresh ones :) It's a good thing to note for newbies in case they don't know."
Baking,3c65lc,twishling,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:16:26 2015 UTC,Yes you are right (: I just meant I don't use actual raw/fresh eggs. The majority of substitutes (not all but certainly most) are some form of egg.

Baking,3c65lc,CookiesByIngrid,3,Sun Jul 5 12:21:30 2015 UTC,The recipe for all these cookies specifically is:   1 cup softened butter 1.5 cups powdered sugar 1 egg 1 tbsp vanilla 3 cups flour  1 tsp salt  Using powdered sugar instead of granulated helps with reducing spread of the cookie and also not using any baking powder/soda also helps create a flat surface good for decorating.
Baking,3c65lc,RubyGetsNaked,4,Sun Jul 5 19:30:21 2015 UTC,"It's sugar cookies.  200 g of softent butter  200 g of regular sugar  1 egg  400 g of flour.  You mix the butter and the sugar first, then add in the egg and then the flour a little at a time. When it's all mixed together you put it in the frigde for an hour, tightly wrapped. They hold their shape because the dough is cold. If it gets too warm pop it back into the frigde :-)  This is enough for around 25 cookies depending on size and shape. You bake them for around 12 minutes in a pre heated oven set to 200 C"

I see them a lot and these ones are especially beautiful, but with the hardened icing and a simple sugar cookie, isn't it dry and dull to eat?   I'm honestly wondering. Not trying to be a dick. If I'm right and they're not the most interesting to eat, that obviously does not take away from the amazing craftsmanship and skill. I'm very impressed!"

It's not going to be the best damn cookie you've ever had, but you'll definitely eat more than one.  Now, texture wise, it's not for everyone.  My husband personally hates how hard the frosting gets.  He makes sure to sneak one an hour or 2 after I decorate.  I've had other people tell me they love them so it really is a personal preference.  It think they're delicious and my mom absolutely loves them."

Then melt it only till body temp and if you can, possibly mix it in the shells if you can do so. If not, just pour it out and mix fast and repan before it sets up."

Baking,3c5g00,Elenemohpee,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:36:03 2015 UTC,Recipie for crust:  This is a traditional italian recipie given to me by my grandmother. She used to make it on the table with out a mixer but in the one in the picture i used a kitchen aid.  2-1/2 cups all purpose flour 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1/4 grated lemon rhind (i use half) 1/4 tsp salt 1 tsp vanilla 1-1/2 tsp baking powder  Mix these ingriedients well then add 2 eggs let each mix seperately.   The next two steps are to be swapped back and forth on.  1 cup cubed unsalted butter 1 shotglass full of 3/4 lemonchello 1/4 vodka (she uses strega not vodka but you can use whatever liquor you want its just for flavor the alcohol gets baked away it is safe for children to eat once baked)  You want all the butter to get mixed in but only pour a little bit of the shot glass at a time. If your dough gets too soggy just add a little flour at a time by the spoonfull dont get carried away.

A wedding cake is a lot of work.... There's a reason they're so expensive!  Something  you could look into would be getting a small 2 tiered cake decorated nicely as the 'show piece' and then getting backup cakes to serve the rest of the guests.

Baking,3c5pl0,kimmygstl,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:12:33 2015 UTC,In the same boat honestly. My sister in law made her own for their wedding but there were issues with the venue so we basically had to smuggle in a home made cake in professional looking boxes.   Apparently most venues in the area don't allow any home made food items to be served as the maker of said goods wouldn't have insurance (say someone gets food poisoning and sues). Would be a good idea to check into whether or not you even have the ability to.

Also for clarity, I'd say 'mix the flour, sugars', etc if both the caster and light brown sugar are supposed to be added at the same time - having two in the ingredient list and referring to it in the singular is confusing..."

Baking,3bze7r,PrettyBaked,4,Fri Jul 3 11:27:49 2015 UTC,"You could double for labor and that would leave you with some pocket change, however you may very well be short changing yourself.  Consider how long these bouquets would take you to make. You don't necessarily have to include baking time and such, mostly just active labor. How much is your time worth to you? At minimum wage ($7.25) if you are active on this project for an hour that leaves you a difference of $7.75 to cover the ingredients and have a little extra. If active time is longer than an hour though you will start cutting into making less for your time.  In restaurants a general guide is to triple the total cost of food to determine a price for a particular dish. That leaves room to pay staff and overhead. Obviously your expenses aren't as high as a restaurant so doubling would likely be reasonable if it doesn't take a huge amount of your time."

Baking,3bvsre,1701ncc,11,Thu Jul 2 22:21:32 2015 UTC,"Make dough. Search for something like ""no spread sugar cookie"" - you want a recipe with no raising agent and a low baking time. Divide into 7 portions. Or 6, depending on how much you care about the delineation of indigo and violet. Mix in gel colours. Although you should ideally mix the colour in with the wet ingredients while you're making the dough, since you can over-knead it if you try to work colouring into the mixed dough, which may give your baked cookies a rough surface. These instructions could be better ordered, couldn't they. Roll the dough into long rectangular slabs. Illustration! The more precise and even they are, the better the layering of the cookies will be. Lay the slabs on top of each other to form a big rainbow brick, and gently press them together. Illustration #2! Refrigerate for an hour. Cut off slices from the short end of the brick. Illustration #3! Try not to smoosh it all together, or get any stray fragments mixed into other colours. Use a cookie cutter to cut each slice into a heart, or whatever symbol best fits your agenda. Illustration #4! Bake. Don't overbake. Brown rainbows are less impressive. Test-baking a couple will help you work out the ideal baking time and temperature."

Baking,3bwpic,happymacaron,2,Fri Jul 3 09:31:47 2015 UTC,"Makes 12  INGREDIENTS  DOUGH  2 ¼ teaspoon active dry yeast  1 cup warm milk (I used skim)  ½ cup granulated sugar  1/3 cup margarine (room temperature)  1 teaspoon salt  2 eggs (room temperature)  4 cups all-purpose flour  FILLING  ½ cup margarine  1 ¼ cups packed light brown sugar  2 ½ tbs cinnamon  2 tbs cornstarch  ICING  4oz (1/2 cup) softened cream cheese  1 cup icing sugar  ¼ cup margarine  ½ tsp vanilla extract  METHOD  Warm milk in microwave for 45 seconds  Stir in 1 teaspoon of the granulated sugar  Stir the yeast into the milk and let sit for 5 minutes (milk should become bubbly)  While the yeast mixture is sitting combine all dry ingredients (salt, sugar, flour). Whisk the two eggs and add to dry ingredients. Add margarine and combine all ingredients with a spatula.   Slowly combine the yeast mixture in with the dough with a spatula.   Once your mixture starts to form more of a dough it is best to work it with lightly floured hands. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and knead until you have a dense ball.  Place dough into a greased bowl (I used pam to coat the bowl and my dough), cover with saran wrap and then a tea towel and let rise till doubled (60 minutes).  Combine dry ingredients for filling and set aside.  Grease either a large cookie sheet, or 2 9x13 baking dishes. – I used margarine.  Once the dough has risen, punch it down with your hands and place it on your lightly floured work surface. Roll out the dough until it is approximately 21 inches long by 16 inches wide (approx. ¼ inch thick).  Spread margarine onto the dough – leaving a 1 inch bare strip at the end furthest away from you (you will coat this with water which will help with sealing the roll).   Sprinkle (generously) the cinnamon/brown sugar/cornstarch mixture on top of the margarine – (I didn’t end up using the full amount this time but I definitely will the next time I make the buns).   Take a rolling pin and press the dry mixture into the dough, rolling back and forth until smooth.  Working carefully, begin rolling up the dough from the longest edge. Cover the 1 inch strip that you bare, with some warm water and press to seal.  Using tooth floss (if you don’t have any floss handy I would suggest using a serrated bread knife) slice the log in half (placing the tooth floss under your dough, wrapping the floss around the dough, and slicing through with a criss-cross motion). Divide each half into 6 pieces using the same method with the floss. You can either discard the end pieces or include them in with your baking as filler.  Place your rolls into your baking dishes – leave at least a 1-2 inch space between each roll. Cover with oiled saran wrap and let rise for 1 hour.  Preheat your oven to 375’F, place rack in center of the oven and bake for 15 – 20 minutes until they are a light golden brown.  With a electric hand mixer: Whisk cream cheese, butter & vanilla extract. Slowly incorporate icing sugar.  Immediately cover with half of the frosting and let it melt (this insures ooey gooey cinnamon buns) and top with the remaining when you want to devour them.  Enjoy!!!!!!!!  If you have any questions just ask! I am not the best at typing out recipes!"

Baking,3bxphp,XoEllebelleoX,4,Fri Jul 3 00:42:11 2015 UTC,"The difference is in the type of batter. If you're using one that rises a lot, your swirls will be less distinct. If it's a denser batter that doesn't rise much, your initial swirl pattern will remain better intact. Regardless, tapping down the batter before and after swirling will release the air trapped inside the pan, and can prevent swirl-destroying blowouts. Just drop the pan a few times from a few inches above your countertop and wiggle to release the bubbles. Best of luck!"
Baking,3bxphp,JoyceCarolOatmeal,2,Fri Jul 3 03:47:48 2015 UTC,"In the nice version it looks like the part that gets swirled in is creamy, like cheesecake batter, so it will swirl nicely when you drag a knife thorough it.

Baking,3by7ng,OkayKK,8,Sat Jul 4 06:43:21 2015 UTC,"Listen, I'm going to be very blunt here after reading your conversation with audersaur. Please try to understand that while I am being quite frank I am not intending to be offensive.  Have you at least worked in a professional kitchen before? Have you explained your level of baking experience to the staff you spoke with at the bakery?  Working in the food industry is tough work all around, even in bakeries. You're going to work in hot, uncomfortable, sometimes stressful environments. You are expected to know A LOT about food handling, health codes, how to avoid cross contamination, etc. You will work really long and often irregular hours. Plain and simple it is just not as easy as going in, making some cookies or pies, and ""wafting in the scents of a bakery all day, every day."" In fact after about 20 minutes you're going to be so surrounded by and accustomed to the smells in the kitchen that you won't even notice them. You will be sweaty. For a while until you get used to it your wrists will probably hurt from kneading and rolling out large quantities of dough.  I truly understand your desire to work in a bakery, it's a lovely idea, and for a long time I was one of those people who wasn't ""technically qualified"" for a bakery job but ended up getting one anyways.   The difference here is that I had been working in professional kitchens for 8 years when I got my job. I had been baking passionately on my own since I was 13, and had decided at the age of 19 that I was going to own a bakery some day. I invested time and money into very dry boring text books that broke down the science of what's happening when you're baking. I may not have been ""technically qualified"" because I had no experience as a professional baker, nor had I gone to pastry school, but I certainly had the skill set and the knowledge. Not just the knowledge to bake well, but also what's expected from the health department when you work in a restaurant grade kitchen, and how to prepare food in bulk.  There are people out there who would give their left leg for the opportunity you're about to get, but, they have spent years dreaming about it and preparing for their chance to prove their worth. There are people who already have those bakery jobs and they sweat and labour every day to make sure that they continue to run a successful business that serves a quality product.   I'm not trying to tell you that it's not a dream worth working towards, but working towards is the key phrase there. The way you describe your lack of experience, and your desire to spend your work days wafting in the smells and flavors of the bakery, drastically undermines the amount of work that other people put into either obtaining or maintaining baking jobs. It implies that you feel like just anyone should be able to waltz in and do the work that we do, and while I understand completely that you in no way meant to be offensive, it's hard not to be taken aback when reading this post and your comments.  I'm sorry for sending you such a long response, and I know it's not what you wanted to hear, but I just really thought the negative reactions in here should be explained."

Heat the sugar to 250F(120C). If it boils clean the sides of the pan with a damp pastry brush. Try not to continually mix the solution. Allow it to heat on its own. In another bowl or the bowl of your Kitchen Aid whisk the eggs and egg yolks until it lightens in colour.  Once the hot sugar mixture reaches 250F pour immediately into the whisking egg mixture. You may find turning down the whisking speed temporarily will help prevent hot sugar threads from flying everywhere. However, it is imperative to pour the hot sugar mixture in quickly and then increase to a higher whisking speed.  Continue whisking until the mixture has cooled down completely. It will start to look like a meringue and be glossy.  Meanwhile, cream then whisk the butter until it has thickened. Once the egg mixture-meringue has cooled, add the butter. Continue whisking until the butter cream is smooth. It may curdle slightly but this is okay. Keep whisking and the butter cream will come back together. Cut open the tea bag and sprinkle into the buttercream and whisk until smooth."

Baking,3bvvqa,bre-anna,2,Thu Jul 2 16:04:33 2015 UTC,"This recipe follows the muffin method, so there is minimal air being beaten into the batter, this naturally leads to a denser muffin.  Look for a recipe that has you cream butter and sugar together as one of the first steps if you want less dense muffins.  Baking powder needs moisture and heat to activate and provide a rise, but if too much of it is used, the product will have a bitter taste.  Baking soda is used to complement the baking powder because it needs an acid, heat, and moisture to activate. It has a soapy taste when too much is used, so generally there is a balance between the two ingredients!  Happy baking!"

Making cakes will most likely be the most profitable part of your business, but it's tough to build that client base before having a solid reputation.  Cupcakes will definitely help you with that, showing the quality of your product as an example for specialty cakes.  It's tough to make it on pastries, cookies, and coffee alone, people are also looking for something more filling like quiche or some kind of home-made hot pocket.  Try to think of any savory items that are easy to freeze, bake, and reheat.  The POS system at one of the bakeries I work for is Lavu.  I'm not sure of the reputation, but it seems to work pretty well, our main problems have come from poor internet service and our credit card processor.  Lavu seems to work well for the most part (runs on iPad or iPhones), when I've had an issue, their support over the phone usually solves it pretty quick.    As far as equipment goes, it's hard to tell what you'll need until you have a space, but if you have the cash and storage, commercial equipment like mixers can be a good investment if you find the deals.  See if there's anything like a Habitat for Humanity ReStore in your area. Can be very hit or miss, but can have deals on commercial stuff.  Other than that, keep an eye out on craigslist or any other resources you can find on bakery/restaurant closures, liquidating their equipment.  It's tough to find out much about food distributors just from their website, and for some of them, it's tough to even find their website itself.  It's best to contact their offices once you know what specific ingredients, quantities, and how often you'll be ordering from them.  You'll most likely have different distributors for different items, I'm not sure how to go about it other than talking with some business owners in the area, possibly past employers? It'll also really depend on your menu and storage space.  I'll try to think of anything more I have to add, not sure if this is helpful at all, but figured a reply is better than nothing."
Baking,3bs1wg,reebsgeebs,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:47:02 2015 UTC,Lavu is a pretty decent system. I haven't used it in a few years so undoubtedly its improved. It is just a little bit slow for a service environment but if you are selling from a counter I imagine that it would be just about right. The inventory tracking features are also very helpful.

Baking,3bo7a6,sabtacular,3,Tue Jun 30 20:11:09 2015 UTC,"Picture of the inside, for the curious people.  Recipe  Lemonade Cake (from this website)  1 cup butter, room temperature  1 3/4 cups granulated sugar  2 tablespoons fresh lemon zest  2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour  1 teaspoon baking powder  1 teaspoon baking soda  1/2 teaspoon salt  4 large eggs, room temperature  1/3 cup cup fresh lemon juice  1 cup buttermilk (I prefer this to be close to room temp as well)  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray two 9-inch round baking pans with baking spray.  Fit a stand mixer with whisk attachment. Beat butter, sugar, and lemon zest until light and fluffy.  In a separate bowl, mix together dry ingredients and set aside.  With the mixer on low speed, add the eggs, one at a time, combining thoroughly in between additions. With the mixer still running, add the lemon juice. (batter will look curdled, but it's not). Add 1/3 of the dry ingredients and 1/2 cup of the buttermilk. Mix, then stop and scrape the sides of the bowl. Repeat, adding another third of the dry ingredients and the remaining 1/2 cup buttermilk. Mix, then stop and scrape. Add the remaining third of the dry ingredients and mix until completely combined and the batter is light and fluffy.  Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake the cakes for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool before removing from the pans.  Strawberry Filling (similar recipe here, but use whatever recipe you'd like)  2 1⁄2 cups coarsely chopped hulled strawberries  1⁄2 cup sugar  2 1⁄2 tablespoons cornstarch  Bring all ingredients to a boil in a heavy small sauce pan, stirring constantly and crushing berries slightly with back of spoon. Boil 2 minutes to thicken, stirring constantly (mixture will be slightly chunky). Pour into bowl and cool completely.  Lemon Buttercream (recipe here. I recommend doubling this for a 2-layer 9"" cake)  1 cup of salted butter (or 1 cup unsalted + ~1/2 tsp salt)  4 cups of icing sugar/ powdered sugar  2 tablespoons lemon zest (I used more)  3 tablespoons lemon juice (I used more)  2 teaspoons cream (heavy whipping or half & half)  Whip butter in stand mixer until fluffy. Add in sugar, one cup at a time, beating continuously. Add lemon zest and lemon juice. Add cream to thin out the frosting until you get the desired consistency.  Personal notes  This cake was amazing. Definitely one of my favorite cakes I've ever made, but that's just my taste. The cake itself has a very strong lemony taste, which I LOVED.  The filling is just a standard thing my mom taught me how to make and we use it in a lot of cakes! It's a great way to spruce up a boxed cake when you don't have the time for scratch-made cake.  The lemon buttercream, on its own, was fantastic as well. The fresh lemon juice really adds a nice tartness. When combined with the cake, however, it was a little too much lemon for my own taste. I definitely plan to use it again, but on something a little less ""powerful,"" such as sugar cookies."

Baking,3bmo7r,Sagarmatra,4,Tue Jun 30 13:30:35 2015 UTC,"This thread is relevant to my interests...here's my childhood favorite.  My mother used to make a fruit pie that contained the following (sorry for poor details, I never made it):  - cool whip - strawberry yogurt - strawberry jello - fresh strawberries (bananas optional) - graham cracker crust   The whole pie would be frozen. Ideally you'd let it defrost for 10 min before eating. On a hot day this pie was sooooooo perfect. I could eat obscene amounts of it. However, as I've gotten older my desire to eat processed foods like cool whip are pretty low, so I've been planning to recreate it with more natural ingredients. Here's what I've been kicking around:   make some real whipped cream keep the strawberry yogurt (Greek), or go plain yogurt and use a high quality jam like Bon maman ditch the jello/cool whip  cut up strawberries/bananas and fold it all together gently  put in crust and freeze (perhaps not all the way?)   Despite it being very simple, I have no idea how this will come out, but I'm determined to recreate the pie with ingredients that are all fresh.

Baking,3bpvtq,wilfredthedonkey,3,Wed Jul 1 04:51:33 2015 UTC,What about doing the cake but making the inside rainbow by dying the batter and leaving the outside 4th of July fruits so the surprise comes when you cut into it. Like this if it's sheet cake or like this if it's layer cake.
Baking,3bpvtq,Rs7uN6g1X,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:05:11 2015 UTC,"Well the problem isn't that it's not rainbow enough. The problem is that I need a more interesting dessert than yellow or white cake.

Baking,3bpvtq,Queen___Bee,2,Wed Jul 1 23:59:00 2015 UTC,"There is a few options different from the traditional yellow cake with frosting, which are crumb, upside down, and poke cakes. These cakes can also have flavors, such as coconut, liquor, etc., added if need be.  For the crumb, you basically mix the fruit with the cake mix then add a streusel-crumb topping. If you want to add some LGBTQ pride to it, add some rainbow sprinkles inside and/or on top or even skittles on top after the cake has cooled.  For the upside down cake, you could arrange the fruit in the flag shape with bananas, or maybe coconut if possible, then have the cake mix rainbow-colored or include rainbow sprinkles.  For the poke cake, you can use a combination of dye for the cake itself and jello colors not used in the cake for the rainbow, then the fruits on top after frosting.  Hope this helped!  EDIT: though of another option"

Baking,3bjiay,crumbspastryshop,2,Tue Jun 30 08:09:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yea, I've found the fondant can get a little overwhelming.   I like to either use Fondarific, which I think has a pretty good taste, or if I have the time, I make my own by melting marshmallow and add vanilla for flavoring.  I try to roll the fondant as paper thin as I can, but I guess some people will enjoy it, and unfortunately some folks instinctively peel the fondant off anyway.  If I could do it over, I wish I would've thought of coconut... I LOVE the way your cakes look!"

Thank you :) But if you try the coconut thing, be warned, it was a pain in the ass to assemble the sashimi ones. the little ""belt"" wouldn't stick properly to the coconut layer and although i used buttercream as a layer between fruit and belt, the fruit juices started to melt the belts. Thankfully it didn't have to last long as it was eaten right away, but it's nothing which can be prepared a day in advance."

Baking,3bi5va,MiserableLie,4,Mon Jun 29 12:35:57 2015 UTC,"I have never tried infusing raspberries, only cherries, and cherries are a little different because they have soft flesh exposed (once you take out the pit) and hold together better thanks to their thicker outer skin.  I'm guessing 6 hours/overnight would be enough to give them some flavour without causing them to break down. But I'm really not sure how much alcohol would get in there, how well it would penetrate the membranes of those little fruitlets. You could experiment, if you have a week until you need the cake. Get scientific!  Make sure you're using fresh ones if you want them to hold together really well. Frozen ones tend to rupture when ice crystals form inside them, so they defrost a little bit mushier - although actually that may be beneficial for your purposes, since it would help them infuse better, and their appearance doesn't matter as much if they'll be inside the cake.  If you want to get more Chambord into your cake, you could literally pour some onto the cake layers, or apply it with a brush if you want to be more delicate, and it will soak in. This is how kirsch is applied to black forest cake, and sugar syrups are used to moisten and infuse flavour into other types of cake. I've seen /u/yolanda_gampp do this with a squeeze bottle with a sprinkler head in a couple of her videos."
Baking,3bi5va,01111000marksthespot,2,Mon Jun 29 14:16:15 2015 UTC,"I was hoping that cutting into the cake would reveal whole raspberries inside which would look impressive if I could pull it off successfully, but I hear what you're saying about the potential benefits of using frozen raspberries which would be more likely to take on flavour from the liqueur when they disentegrate slightly during defrosting.  Funny you should mention the black forest gateau as this was the source of inspiration for this cake. Only I prefer raspberries to cherries and was hoping I could swap out cherries/kirsch for raspberries/Chambord. So the plan is definitely to brush the layers of chocolate sponge with Chambord for extra flavour. There will also be a chocolate ganache, which again I can flavour with a dash of Chambord if needed.  I'm glad I've got over a week to experiment though as it looks like I've got some research to do! Thanks for responding."
Baking,3bi5va,VictoriaSnowww,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:41:46 2015 UTC,"If you want the raspberries to look really lovely and whole, make sure you build a little ledge around the outside of the layer in buttercream, then let it chill before filling and stacking. This will give the cake a bit of structural integrity so those raspberries don't just mush under the weight of the next cake layer!"

Baking,3bihuc,twonights,2,Mon Jun 29 14:31:51 2015 UTC,"I've had good luck with this recipe for blondies. It's very quick and easy to make. (I'm new to baking as well so I've mostly been sticking with simple recipes like this for now until I learn more.)  I've made the recipe three times so far. The second and third time, I used cinnamon chips instead of chocolate chips and everyone loved it. The cinnamon chips are made by Hersheys and come in a bag just like chocolate chips. The only drawback is that not all grocery stores sell them. The only place I could find them in my area was at Walmart."
Baking,3bihuc,kbennett73,2,Mon Jun 29 15:55:58 2015 UTC,"Texas sheet cake? I love the way the cake gets gooey under the icing after it sits for a while. The fact that it just gets better as it gets older is a plus, but it never lasts all that long.  Found this link on Southern Living's website with lots of other sheet cake ideas, but I do like the chocolate.  http://www.southernliving.com/food/entertaining/party-perfect-sheet-cake-recipes/view-all  And I like making it with sour cream (instead of buttermilk) and butter instead of shortening. I bake mine in a 9x13 pan instead of a half sheet pan the way some recipes do. http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/texas-sheet-cake-3"

Baking,3bifhr,suzannedm,2,Mon Jun 29 14:11:52 2015 UTC,"A few questions..  1) Are you sifting the dry ingredients? It must be very fine to be smooth. 2) Are you underfolding the batter? The point of this stage is to deflate the mixture so it's smooth and runny so don't be hesitant to mix it well. 3) Are you using silicon or parchment paper? I don't get any sticking with paper. 4) How long and what temp are you baking them? Underbaked macarons will stick. 5) Finally, the resting stage is not to smooth them but to dry them. They should be smooth pretty much in the first 30 seconds after piping."

Line 2 cupcake tins with paper liners, set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the cake flour, baking powder and salt. Whisk to combine. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, add the butter and lemon zest. Beat on medium-high speed for about 3 minutes, until light and fluffy.

Baking,3b7fka,bigdorkdoglover,2,Fri Jun 26 22:54:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it doesn't take too long most of the time. I usually spend about 2-3 minutes per cookie for the base designs, and maybe 5 on detail work once the base dries. I'm not OP, but it moves pretty quickly because you do each cookie in sections so layers can be drying as you work."

Baking,3bcmfa,IAmTheLiar,2,Sat Jun 27 23:13:09 2015 UTC,"Yep, it is most likely because you left it to close to the top element. Where is the rack positioned in your oven? But of course it may have started to brown too for having it in too long, or having it slightly too high. How long did you cook it for, and at what temperature?  And for you to have learned to make a cheesecake today and have it not crack is super impressive, way to go you!  Edit: question where I should have just stated"
Baking,3bcmfa,SweetContext,2,Sun Jun 28 19:42:06 2015 UTC,"I cooked at 325 for about 1 1/2 hours in a waterbath then I let it rest for about a hour with the oven turned odd. Then I kept it overnight in the fridge. I did think my rack was too high when I was putting it in, but I figured it wouldn't matter :/  Also, thanks! I was really worried about it cracking which didn't happen. I topped it with a sour cream topping which helped cover up the brown spots and it still tasted great!"
Baking,3bcmfa,SweetContext,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:15:30 2015 UTC,"Awesome! I'm glad it came out. Brown spots don't really matter at home, more so in a kitchen or bakery, but I feel you when you want to accomplish a perfect looking cheesecake.  So I guess next time you know to lower the rack. Or protip: I've always cooked my cheesecakes at 300F for 2h - 2h15m then let it cool in the oven (off) with the door cracked until it's room temp. Then fridge! But whatever works for your stove is key c:"
Baking,3bcmfa,01111000marksthespot,2,Tue Jun 30 17:51:25 2015 UTC,"It looks like it overbaked a little. I tend to get a similar issue when I overbake mine, but mine get more of a browned ring or crescent around the edge, rather than your slightly creme brulee appearance.  It will still taste absolutely fine. The only negatives are the appearance, and the texture as it will have a slightly crusted surface on top. Many cheesecake recipes include a 'topping' layer, sometimes sour cream and sugar, sometimes a fruit glaze, fruit topping, or sauce, which conceals an imperfect surface.  Some suggestions to avoid this in future are to reevaluate your baking time and bake at a lower temp for longer, bake your cheesecake in a water bath, place a dish of water in your oven on the layer below the cheesecake (which will fill your oven with steam and prevent it from drying out), or cover the cheesecake with foil half or two thirds of the way through baking to shield the surface from circulating heat (just make sure the foil isn't in contact with the surface of the cheesecake or it will wreck it). Cheesecakes can be fickle, so it may be hard to figure out exactly what you're doing wrong (eg. baking time/temp, knowing when it's done based on the 'jiggle') and the best remedy to get a consistently perfect result.  Your cheesecake does look impressively level and not cracked at all, which is great."
Baking,3bcmfa,01111000marksthespot,2,Mon Jun 29 05:33:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I cooked it at 325 for about 1 1/2 hours in a waterbath then I let it rest for about an hour in the oven after I turned it off. Then I kept it overnight in the fridge. When I checked up on it, it was already a little brown.   I was worried a bit about cracking which luckily didn't happen and I did cover the top with a sour cream topping. It still tasted great!  Also, about the waterbath, do you have any tricks to keep water from leaking in? I triple-wrapped the foil, but when I took the cheesecake out of the fridge the next day, the bottom was leaking water. Surprisingly, my crust was still pretty dry, but I was pretty worried that I had soaked my cheesecake."

I listened to an interview she did a couple weeks ago and bought Milk Bar Life immediately afterwards. It's a different book than the first one, in that it's all the stuff they eat at the bakery, and I have a soft spot for family meal. It's the one of best parts of working in a kitchen. I've baked half the stuff in the Milk Bar Cookbook, and I absolutely love it, but I love the second one for things like sugar cookie bars, and apple dumplings because they're simple favorites.

I'd say the hardest part about the cakes is spreading the icing (the recipes never make enough, either!) over the cake crumbs.  I think in the future I'll double the icing and pipe it on in concentric circles.  As far as ingredients, everything has been easy except the passion fruit puree.  I had a really hard time finding that but ended up getting frozen puree from BJ's (like Costco).  None of the international markets near me had it.  My favorite is the birthday cake!

Baking,3b7bxn,craskin,5,Fri Jun 26 21:37:22 2015 UTC,"I'd be glad to share the recipe! If you'd like to use crunchy peanut butter, I suggest using about a 1/2 cup of crunchy peanut butter and the rest creamy. Or just use all crunchy peanut butter if you like crunch of the peanuts!   Ingredients: - 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour - 3/4 teaspoon baking soda - 1/4 teaspoon salt - 1/2 cup butter or margarine - 1 cup peanut butter (it originally calls for 1/2 cup but you get the true peanut butter flavor!) - 1/2 cup granulated sugar - 1/2 cup packed brown sugar (light or dark. Doesn't matter) - 1 egg - 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract  Directions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Stir together flour, baking soda, and salt and put to the side. In a mixer bowl beat the butter for 30 seconds. Add peanut butter and both granulated and brown sugar and beat until fluffy. Add egg and vanilla and beat in well. Add dry ingredients gradually until combined. The dough should no longer stick to the sides of the bowl at this point. Take a small bowl and fill with a little bit of granulated sugar. Roll the cookie dough into 1 inch balls (or use a cookie scoop and roll into a ball with your hands),  and drop the ball into the bowl of sugar and roll it around until coated with sugar. Repeat with dough balls until you fill up your baking sheet. Take a fork and create the crisscross design on each cookie and sprinkle some more sugar lightly on top of the cookies. Place the cookie sheet in the oven and bake for 10 minutes or until you see the edges of the cookies lightly golden. Remove from oven, place on cooling rack, and enjoy!  If your dough comes out still a little wet after adding in all the ingredients then it's okay if you add a little more flour at the end. I've done it a couple times and it still comes out great! I hope this recipe is clear enough for you. :)"

And I rarely put salt in sweet things even if the recipe calls for it. Plus I didn't specify if it was caster or granulated white sugar. When I write down recipes like I did, I write down the bare minimum I need to do it. If I got stuck on anything I would've just gone back to the pc quickly to double check.   Although its usually bbc recipes that I use. Partly because I know they'll be reliable, plus they use weights and not cups!"

Baking,3b6ygf,Echilon,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:25:40 2015 UTC,"Yes generally:     If the filling is very wet or if the pie will not be baked for very long   For example, an apple pie bakes or about 50+ minutes so there is  plenty of time to bake the crust even with the pie filling boiling inside of it.  But a soft-body fruit pie (peach, strawberry, etc.) will not need as much cooking time so I would blind-bake the crust there."

Baking,3b5yuz,ikeaspecial,3,Fri Jun 26 06:21:34 2015 UTC,"I think part of the issue with this particular attempt might be the fact that you used a sheet cake recipe to make a layer cake.  I'm far from an expert on cake baking, so I can't say for sure, but I would think the sheet cake recipe might be a bit heavier than a standard layer cake recipe.  It looks like your layers are a bit overdone on the outside edges, which could be due to the fact that the recipe contemplates a much thinner cake.  But your cake does look quite lovely!"
Baking,3b5yuz,harper64,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:51:55 2015 UTC,"I have this hunch that if you fill a cake pan to make a full cake, but cut it into layers layers - like I did- the batter would be too dense to form the air bubbles needed. I also keep seeing bakers fill only their pans by only a half for each layer. Can this also be cause? Also, what recipe do use? Helpful input by the way!"
Baking,3b5yuz,harper64,2,Fri Jun 26 18:15:32 2015 UTC,"I never really bake layer cakes, but if you're truly committed to improving your baking skills I highly recommend www.joyofbaking.com.

Baking,3b5yuz,Rs7uN6g1X,2,Fri Jun 26 22:47:51 2015 UTC,"I really think you should try a layer cake recipe if you're going to make a layer cake. Baking is really tried and true so it's best to focus on what others know works before thinking you can do whatever you feel like.  And more importantly you baked this in one pan??? That's not recommend because it takes longer so the outside gets over baked like you mentioned. It will be harder, drier, and more dense. You have to use two pans for lighter moister layers that bake quicker."

Baking,3b379c,spriingcakes,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:02:11 2015 UTC,"i dont think vanilla extract would work instead of almond because they have very different and distinct flavors. Especially for this type of recipe, almond is the type of taste you would want. Almond extract i find easily in the groceries right beside vanilla extract but i live in canada.   Just based on assumption it seems like unsweetened coconut flakes would be a good choice as to not already add more sweetness to the cookies but i don't know, she never really mentioned it in the recipe so I guess you could use either or-just keep in mind sweetness and I find Moroccan sweets to not be as sweet as north american kinds."

Baking,3b385o,mapleandvanilla,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:17:43 2015 UTC,"Couldn't you simply adjust it yourself, if you're using recipes you're used to? (Which you presumably are, if you know that the recipe yields different amounts for you than listed in the recipe.)  12 is roughly 2/3 of 17, so if you make a 2/3 batch, that'll give you the 12 cupcakes you want (based on your pans/how you fill them). There are 16 tablespoons in a cup, which makes conversion fairly easy if you're okay with a small amount of fudging. (Like 1/2 cup is 8 tablespoons, so for a 2/3 recipe, I'm going to put in 5 tablespoons and just make the last one rounded -- baking by volume isn't precise enough for me to see any point in trying to figure out for to measure EXACTLY 2/3 of 8 tablespoons using volume measurements.)"
Baking,3b322e,lesgoodgirl,3,Thu Jun 25 15:51:17 2015 UTC,"Fair warning: you may need to experiment a bit. Also I'm very ""anything goes"" in the kitchen, so don't expect precision here. :)  For a pan that size, I'd start with enough mix to make a dozen and a half cupcakes, if you can multiply/divide the recipe like that. I feel like a dozen wouldn't be enough batter, while two dozen might overflow. The baking time will need to be increased, so keep that in mind.  Start checking on the cake when you'd be taking cupcakes out of the oven. If it starts to brown too much, cover the pan with tinfoil, leaving a small vent in the middle. Take it out when it passes the toothpick test."
Baking,3b322e,LeucanthemumVulgare,2,Thu Jun 25 18:22:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks very much for the advice, I am going to do a trial run so I'll try just that!

Baking,3b322e,Hairy_Ball_Theroem,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:40:11 2015 UTC,If the cupcake recipe makes a certain number of cupcakes I would figure out the total volume of that many cupcake holes (hole things in a cupcake pan) then compare that to the volume of your square pan.
Baking,3b322e,mapleandvanilla,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:06:03 2015 UTC,"Your pan (odd size, btw) holds 4.5L of batter if full -- so you probably need around 2.5L of batter, since you never actually fill a pan to the top with batter. This is approximately 10 cups of batter (10 cups = 2.4L).  How many cupcakes does your cupcake recipe say it makes? If it says it makes 12 cupcakes (in my experience, this seems to corresponds to a recipe for a 20cmx20cm/8inx8in square ban, which holds 1.4L/6 cups of batter if full), you could make a double batch, fill your larger pan to about 1/2 or 2/3 full, and then make a few cupcakes or a mini-cake if you have small pans with the extra batter (for, um, pre-tasting and quality control -- or perhaps for making your neighbours or coworkers like you better).  Cupcake batter is usually the same as cake batter (as far as I've noticed -- I've never bothered to differentiate, at any rate), so I wouldn't be too concerned about rising. For baking times, I'd note the time the cupcakes take, maybe google some similar recipes calling for a 13inx9in pan (a much more common size), note the baking times for that, and use that to guide me in when to start checking my cake. Like if the cupcakes take 15-18 minutes, and a sheet cake for the same kind of batter says 35-40 minutes, I would probably start checking/monitoring the cake at 25 minutes. (I almost never cook with a pan that big, so the baking times here are totally made up -- I'm just illustrating how I'd use them to guide me.)"

Baking,3azo2u,phejster,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:07:35 2015 UTC,"Recipe is for 2x 7inch tins:  175g Unsalted butter  175g Caster sugar  175g Self-raising flour  3 tbsp Milk  3 Eggs, large  1 tsp Baking powder  1 tsp Vanilla Bean paste (or vanilla extract)  Preheat oven to Gas mark 4/180c/350f.  Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add vanilla.  Add one egg at a time, beating well after each addition.   Sift flour and baking powder together. Alternate between the milk and flour, ending with flour until the batter is all combined.  Divide the batter between the tins and level the top. Bake on the middle shelf for 25-30 minutes until a skewer comes out clean.  Leave in tins for 10 minutes then finish the cooling on a cooling rack."
Baking,3b2dyv,soupy_e,3,Thu Jun 25 12:28:08 2015 UTC,"I have some, I have used it in a few cupcake recipes, but mostly I use it to make protein pancakes. Similar to regular pancake recipe, except I grind up some oats or mix 50-50 with wholemeal flour - sifting it as it can clump quite badly, use quark and milk to keep the protein up, and I cook them in a pan on a medium low heat. They colour faster than regular pancakes which is why I keep the heat low so the inside can fully cook, but they are pretty damn good. Then I serve with fresh berries, or maple syrup, it works with adding blueberries into the mix too..."

Baking,3azqnp,kellabean,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:26:24 2015 UTC,"http://www.syrupandtang.com/200712/la-macaronicite-1-an-introduction-to-the-macaron/  Here's your bible :) I started right away with the Italian Meringue method on page 3 of the guide. Page two uses the better known (but less reliable) French meringue method.   All I would say is that if you're going to use the Italian Meringue method, make sure you have a stand mixer OR a powerful hand mixer. I don't have a stand mixer, but my hand mixer is rated 400W, more than enough to make sure the meringue is stiff enough to fold in.   Otherwise, it's a stupidly simple recipe. Make sure you follow all the steps and extra tips carefully (e.g. further processing the almond meal and icing sugar), and it'll work. Simple as that!"

Baking,3aw8l1,UrbanRenegade19,21,Wed Jun 24 06:43:17 2015 UTC,"At a small child's birthday (maybe just for 1 year olds? I don't know, I think it's a US thing and I'm not from there, but anyway). You have a normal cake to cut and serve for the guests, and then an extra 'smash cake' to put in front of the kid. The general idea is they eat it with their hands and get it all over their face (i.e. smash it up) - and you can take cute photos."
Baking,3aw8l1,waywardmuffin,15,Wed Jun 24 08:56:11 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'm actually from the US and I've never heard of doing this. At all the small children's parties I've been to they just cut the child a small piece of cake and let them have at it.

Our neighbors had their daughter's first birthday over the weekend, and when placed in front of the cake, she started picking the sprinkles off 1 by 1. She cried when they fed her frosting. It was adorable and hilarious. I hope your babe enjoys the cake more than she did."
Baking,3aw8l1,PoliteAnarchist,22,Wed Jun 24 02:25:20 2015 UTC,"My niece cried over her first birthday cake too! She was a clean little baby and hated being remotely dirty. She was excited about the magical candles and pretty cake at first. Then her baby world came crashing down as soon as she touched the frosting. It was too much for her delicate fingers. When my sister managed to get her to taste it her cries changed to steady whimpering and tears. She loved it and couldn't stop eating it, but was miserable the whole time. Now she's a teenager and has thoroughly rid herself of the need to be clean."

Cream butter and the orange sugar together, then mix in the eggs. Add the buttermilk, orange juice, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. When all is combined, mix in the flour until just incorporated. If necessary, add more orange juice or flour to achieve desired consistency, not as runny as cake batter but not as thick as cookie batter. Drop tablespoon size lumps on cookie sheet and bake at 350 F for 8-10 minutes or until the edges start looking golden brown. Let cool.    To make the glaze combine orange juice, zest, and powdered sugar. Spoon or brush onto cooled cookies and let set. Best served immediately.    This is about how the batter should look. It will spread and rise. Also my grandma's original recipe uses plain milk so you can use that if you don't have buttermilk."

I do all that in the food processor. Then I hand mix/fold in the eggs one at a time.   The foamy, puffy airy is usually from beating in the eggs. I also don't do a water bath, if it cracks, it now has room for extra toppings!  Basic recipe I use: Cream cheese, eggs, sugar, vanilla/flavouring"

Baking,3atk0o,kim_il_barry,2,Tue Jun 23 11:55:00 2015 UTC,I've done macaron towers before. Usually you get a styrofoam cone and cover it with royal icing. Then attach the macarons with toothpicks or a small dab of buttercream
Baking,3atk0o,dhardy123,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:58:00 2015 UTC,"Cool - thanks! Did your tower stand on top of a cake, or just on a table? I'm fine with royal icing on the cone, but can I avoid it for the cake underneath?"
Baking,3atk0o,dhardy123,2,Tue Jun 23 12:02:47 2015 UTC,No I've never done it on a cake. It would be quite heavy so you will need some wood dowels in the cake to hold up the tower.
Baking,3atk0o,_transatlantique,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:05:08 2015 UTC,I'm curious as to the logistics of this regarding consumption. Are guests just expected to pull them off or is it just not for eating?
Baking,3atk0o,dhardy123,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:29:16 2015 UTC,"Yes they pull them off and eat them. It is really no different than a croquembouche. I have also seen a macaron tower that is made of plastic with little holders that hold the macaron in place. Sometimes you can rent this from a pastry shop or party planner. For even more excitement, you could also make mini eclairs and use that in a tower such as what Christope Adam does"

Baking,3avtaz,bbyktty,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:26:09 2015 UTC,A friend of mine makes a white chocolate cheesecake - a chilled one rather than a baked one. White chocolate is swirled through the mix which then sets up then it's served with the coulis of your choice. Everyone raves about it but I find it a bit sweet. So I think I'm more like you and everyone else is a bit more like her and the rest of our friends.

Baking,3armkf,Pappa_Mike,4,Mon Jun 22 23:15:04 2015 UTC,"Cheesecakes alone, yeah thats gunna be hard. Desserts in general, slightly less so. Can you make a gateau? Mousse? Tarts? Creme brulee?  A lot of restaurants have a dedicated pastry chef. See of you can volunteer to spend a day working with one? Pick up some tips and get a feel for the demand of your product.  I'm not sure on the food regulations where you are, but here, you can't sell food products to anyone unless they are produced in a commercial kitchen. Is this something you'll need to do? That is going to have costs involved.  Breaking into an industry often requires free samples, so be prepared to operate at a loss for a while.   You'll also have to register for tax as a business, I believe."
Baking,3armkf,PoliteAnarchist,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:44:57 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I'm untrained and haven't really tried making any other desserts.

As far as taxes go, I wouldn't need to worry too much until after a certain amount of money (30k or so, I believe).  My dad is a CA, so I can get help there."
Baking,3armkf,mythtaken,3,Tue Jun 23 02:27:07 2015 UTC,"I have no experience, I just like cheesecake. It seems to me that since cheesecake freezes well, it might be less problematic to sell than some other things.   From what I can tell, small businesses live or die based on their ability to make the most of every penny they spend and earn.   Do whatever sort of cost analysis you need to and figure out EXACTLY how much each cheesecake will cost to make and store, including all the relevant expenses related to running the business.   As much as you love sharing your creations, remember that your business will need you to be clear headed and have a good plan (and good financing) in order to succeed.   Do you know what sorts of ways you could possibly sell your creations? Sidewalk cart? Food truck? Catering/selling to restaurants? Different communities have their own laws about catering/selling food, so do lots of research.   Best of luck."

I do realize this won't be a walk in the park and that, if I did decide to go forward with it, there will be a lot of hard work and sacrifice involved! My life experience with pinching pennies through and after college shouldn't be a difficult transition to make to a business.  Thanks for your input!

Baking,3armkf,Tuilere,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:05:17 2015 UTC,"Glad to share my thoughts. Mostly what I've learned is that small businesses seem to be vulnerable to financial collapse, so it's crucial to take a clear eyed view.   Starting small the way you seem to have planned sounds smart. (Farmer's market? Sounds great.)   I've seen lots of people crash and burn because they fixate on 'doing what they love' without doing the math, or paying enough attention to what the customer wants to pay for.   It seems to me that experimenting with flavors/textures/sizes would be a good way to lure friends and potential customers into helping you with taste testing. Make/sell whatever people want to pay for, and you should be on your way.   One depressing thing I've learned is that a lot of people really do NOT share my food preferences, so when I'm cooking for others I really have to think about what they enjoy.   Have you tried any savory cheesecakes? I think small ones would be a nice addition to your offerings, as an appetizer for a casual gathering. (Gotta think what goes well with booze/wine/beer. Even if you don't drink, other people do.)"
Baking,3armkf,Tuilere,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:47:32 2015 UTC,"I won't be diving in headfirst on this. I'll continue my current work while looking into it and even if I start. Before even going that far, I wanted opinions.and insight from those with the experience (or even without it. Some people just have a good head for business and bring up issues or ideas I may miss).  My friends have always been happy to let me experiment on them haha. I'm very open-minded about trying different flavours, even if they're ones I may not be a fan of. I'd like to have some common/basic flavours that freeze well and then take orders for the less common requests.  I have thought of doing savory, but haven't tried any."

So all the work and all the delivery and all the all is on her. I suspect this is how she keeps overhead down.

Baking,3armkf,what-doth-life,2,Tue Jun 23 13:49:35 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that purchasing ingredients at retail will eventually break you.  Look into wholesale clubs and being able to get what you can in bulk.  This may be a lot harder doing cheesecakes where most of the ingredients are highly perishable.  Look into EXACTLY what it costs to make each type of cheesecake; like seriously do the math.  If you're buying eggs at $2/dozen, cream cheese at $3/lb, whatever, etc. measure and calculate very specifically how much of each ingredient costs.  Are you paying for electric/gas for you oven?  How long is it on while you're baking?  How much does that cost?  How much will it cost and how do you want to package your cakes?  Will you need a new/bigger freezer/refrigerator for storage?  How much time does it take to make one? Not just ""it's 75 minutes in the oven,"" but how much time total?  What is the value of that?  Once you have carefully calculated all your costs, then you'll get a realistic baseline to set your pricing and how many cakes you will have to make each day/week/month to be profitable.  I'm a phenomenal baker and people often tell me that I should open up a bakery.  But I've run the numbers over and over and the only way I would ever be able to make a real living at it would be with either very high volume production or doing high end wedding cakes. At my particular age, it's not something I want to tackle and frankly, I'm not a businessperson; I'm a baker--that's what I enjoy.  So I take occassional orders here and there (I specialize in French/European-style pastries and small wedding cakes).  This allows me to be creative, enjoy what I do, but still keep my 9-5 job so I can have things I've grown attached to (like a steady paycheck and health insurance).  Good luck in your endeavor, there's really nothing keeping you from being successful if you're willing to do your homework and work very hard!"

Baking,3as1vw,kai-funk,2,Tue Jun 23 01:27:52 2015 UTC,any pictures of the cake or did it magically disappear :P ? My personal guess would be some sort of issue with the eggs or over mixing. I don't know much about baking cakes though (chances are you already know more than I do).  My (barely) educated guess is that the egg-flour structure wasn't strong enough to hold the top layer of the cake. This could be broken down into two main components: *bottom layer too weak *top layer too heavy  again I mostly bake bread so feel free to ignore my driveling

What kind of pans are you using? Are they dark or light? If your layers are rising over the sides, either use taller pans or 10 inch ones instead of 9 inch.  Make sure your egg whites are room temperature so they whip up better. You can also use cream of tartar when whipping them just to make sure you don't overwhip. Be very careful about how you fold them in.  Check your oven temperature as well. Have a thermometer on the inside to be sure that it's accurate when you set it."

I think) of gelling sugar   Bring the raspberries to a boil on the stove. Take off the heat, and put them through a strainer to get rid of the seeds. Mix half with the mascarpone, and put the rest back on the stove and add the gelling sugar. Let this simmer for 1-2 minutes, and then take it off the heat again. Let it cool slightly before combining it with the cheese mixture. Lightly whip the cream and gently fold it in to the cheese/raspberry mix. Put in the fridge for a little while to set.

Baking,3anq1v,bernath,3,Mon Jun 22 00:34:51 2015 UTC,I made this cake for Father's Day. Kind of boring but my dad has simple tastes and yellow cake with chocolate frosting is his favorite.   Cake: http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2009/07/best-birthday-cake/  Frosting: http://addapinch.com/cooking/perfect-chocolate-buttercream-frosting-recipe/
Baking,3anq1v,usurpual,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:39:16 2015 UTC,Yellow cake with chocolate frosting is my favorite too! I've never been able to find a good yellow cake recipe so I usually end up buying a mix. How did it taste?
Baking,3anq1v,mythtaken,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:41:55 2015 UTC,"The flavor was really good...buttery and not overly sweet, which is good because the frosting is really sweet, obviously. Honestly, though, the cake was quite dry. I know what you mean about finding a good yellow cake recipe. I've only tried a few so far but haven't really been satisfied with any of them. It's possible that I overbaked it but I pull cakes out as soon as the middle temps at 205-210F. Plus this recipe uses cake flour which always seems to produce a drier cake in my opinion. So I will continue searching for that elusive perfect yellow cake recipe."

I always found my baking to be too try with convection, and yes, I did adjust the temperature... (One of the inconveniences of convection ovens, as most recipes are written for regular ovens.) Now, I just always use the regular setting. Even if I have to bake multiple sheets/layers at a time, I don't have any issues - I just make sure to rotate my pans from top to bottom and front to back halfway during baking.  TL;DR: just get a good quality regular oven."

The recipe isn't online, but it said it was adapted from Ovenly. I found a very similar recipe here.  Couple notes: This cake was made in a little haste because a dog literally ate my first planned dessert, a lovely strawberry rhubarb almond coffee cake.  So, I whipped up just the cake part of the recipe because I wasn't at home and it doesn't require a mixer.  Once I had the cake, I made a mascarpone and greek yogurt filling (1 small tub of each) and a quick, basic, pourable ganache. The cherries have been in season, so I plopped a bunch in there too.  The cake is delicious! The only change I made was use coca cola instead of beer.   Good luck and sorry for the late, confusing instructions!"

In the last few weeks I've been working with a sourdough starter a friend gave me. He got it from an old bakery and it's apparently quite old, if you could taste it you'd notice a more subtle and mature sour than a new sourdough.   Yesterday I made what I thought was a really good dough and I baked it this morning. This is the result.   What you can't see is that it's underbaked by 5 minutes. However if you toast it that makes zero difference.   EDIT: Seems the image I put up was that of the actual crumb structure. That was silly of me, heres on of the outside.  http://imgur.com/FIw1so4"

Its usually in the form of gooey light brown sludge in a bucket. You feed it, give it a stir occasionally, and let it fester in the back of the fridge until you need a chunk for sourdough."
Baking,3ahra5,WinterMay,3,Sat Jun 20 21:40:56 2015 UTC,"It's sometimes also called a yeast mother. As has been explained, it's yeast munching happily on carbohydrates in the back of the fridge, and is a live organism. As long as you feed it once in a while, it will be a steady supply of yeast for sourdough."

The recipe is:  Italian meringue: 100g egg white 25g sugar 40g water 140g sugar Whip whites and first measure of sugar to stiff peaks, boil remaining sugar and water until 118C and slowly drip into meringue, whip until cool.   200g raspberry puree 4 gelatine leaves 400g cream Soak gelatine leaves in cold water for 10 mins. Whip cream to soft peaks and fold into meringue, drain gelatine and heat until liquified, combine with puree. Fold puree mixture into cream mixture.  I used 3 very thin vanilla sponge layers in the gateau, but you don't have to. The glaze is a sugar syrup with a touch of raspberry puree and gelatine added.  So yummy."

Baking,3acido,existential_tits,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:56:19 2015 UTC,It would probably look like a sunflower with a smaller top tier and bigger bottom tier.
Baking,3acido,geedgad,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:40:56 2015 UTC,I think the top layer would look good dusted with cocoa powder

My only other idea is an ice cream pie with fresh berries and whipped cream, but that's not really baking, unless you make the crust yourself.

Baking,3a793d,SammieB1981,4,Wed Jun 17 20:11:43 2015 UTC,"I used SweetAmbs recipe for the dough and a typical royal icing to decorate. I am upset with the colors; when I mixed them to decorate, they were perfect, but somehow the Orange looks too red after drying and the purple looks grey/black.   I am also upset that it seems the black outline ran into the flood, even though I let the outline dry completely before flooding. Perhaps the humidity in my apartment? They look great, but I want to share the issues I have, maybe others have had the same problems and fixed them.   I used a black cake decorating pen to touch up the mouths and dot the eyes."
Baking,3a793d,DetPepperMD,3,Wed Jun 17 19:55:14 2015 UTC,"They turned out really well! I have yet to try SweetAmbs recipe, but I have heard good things.  As far as your problem that you mentioned, I try to color 8-24 hours before I am going to actually decorate to give the color time to intensify and settle. Do you use gel colors? I typically use Americolor or the Hobby Lobby brand. I've had much better color control with those over Wilton.  Secondly, the bleeding happens when you have a really wet flood icing, and a very strong contrast color. Even if your black was completely dry, a wet flood is likely to pull it out. You could do 1 of 2 things (as far as my knowledge goes). Instead of using straight black to color your icing, you can mix any leftover colors together and then add black, or mix red, yellow, and blue together to make black. I can get the amounts if you want. But that means less actual black dye, and less of a chance of bleed.   You could also make your flood icing thicker, and do a 12-15 second icing instead of a super runny flood. The less humidity and moisture, the less chance of bleeding.   Also, I just remembered this - stick them in front of a fan to dry as soon as possible if you can, because that will help set the icing faster.  Hope that helps!

If you have room, make up your cookies or pastries and put them, unbaked, on a baking tray. Put that flat in the freezer and leave to freeze. Then you can pop them off and put in a ziplock.  I wouldn't freeze frosting but you could leave her some lemon juice and vanilla and powdered sugar teach her to make a simple water icing."

Otherwise your mom would have to take a hammer and chisel to it to get a piece of brownie, haha.   If you're freezing in ziploc bags, instead of using one bag for each brownie (or other baked good), what you can do is place a brownie at the bottom, fold the bag once, another brownie, fold it another time, till you reach the top. :) helps reduce waste!"

Baking,3a7icr,funtimesforalltimes,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:17:05 2015 UTC,It can be tricky. Especially after you stir up the frosting to the right color. Stirring it kind of warms it up and makes it a smidge thinner thus making it harder to work with. Or at least that seems to be my experience. Another suggestion I have is don't rush on it. I think you'd be fine frosting them in the morning before the party as long as you did the test run the night before to work out timing and kinks. You can do it! Good luck and I hope to see pictures.

Baking,3a6nco,MayTheFusBeWithYou,2,Wed Jun 17 17:20:47 2015 UTC,I think that short crust pastry is always a good place to start. It's a bit like biscuit dough. Just make sure that you give it enough time in the fridge to cool down and use lots of flour when rollin git out.  Here's an ok recipe I found http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/eggs-recipes/old-fashioned-sweet-shortcrust-pastry/#lEOxgv4mGcvtTr5B.97 Best luck!
Baking,3a6nco,bebble,2,Wed Jun 17 19:18:20 2015 UTC,Shortcrust is what you're looking for. Puff pastry is occasionally used in tarts but is very different from regular pie dough.
Baking,3a6nco,Echilon,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:33:59 2015 UTC,"There's some part of me that feels puff pastry sheets wouldn't hold up well as a pie crust. Usually you back them off first and then put on their toppings. Puff pastry gets soggy really easily. And a pear pie, like apple would (imo) be best baked all at once.   Now I know you said you're not much for doughs, and trust me I feel you there. I hate pie dough because it always seems like there's more dry than wet, but I've gotten better at it. This recipe, I swear, is the best and easiest pie dough I've ever made and used. I recommend blind baking the pie in this case, since pears tend to be softer than apples. If your pear isn't soft and holds up well like most baking apples then proceed as normal.  Edit: I got excited and only answered part. If you need tips on how to do a lattice top, I can help you with that. I'll take a look in my textbook for you. About the gruyere, which if memory serves is a soft cheese, you can carefully knead it into your dough and even sprinkle some crumbled over top before you start the lattice top."

Baking,3a437a,pregnantandsober,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:57:06 2015 UTC,RECIPE! I used a box French vanilla cake. I'm pretty sure it was Duncan Hines. A pound cake would have made this much easier though. I made an American buttercream for decorating.   1 cup softened butter 2 T shortening 3.5 cups powdered sugar 2 t vanilla extract 2 T milk  Those measurements are approximated. Cream the butter and shortening. Add the powdered sugar in batches so that you don't toss it everywhere. I never sift mine. Then add milk and vanilla. You can add more or less milk to get desired consistency.  and then PIPE YOUR HEART OUT!

They can look very nice when they're all set up and you don't always need proper toppers for them, colour coordinated sprinkles on mini ones is often enough.    If people only want a taste they can grab a mini one, but if people want more after a full size one they can grab extra without eating two regulars.    Minis are more time consuming for the amount of product you end up with but in my opinion they are so cute that it's worth it, and they don't use too much batter or frosting. Whenever I've made them people assume I've gone to far more effort than I actually have..."

Baking,3a3ncq,aggiespartan,3,Tue Jun 16 23:44:02 2015 UTC,"Ingredients  Meringue Layers 12 large egg whites, room temperature 2 cups sugar ¼tsp. cream of tartar or citric acid  Chantilly Cream 4-5 cups heavy whipping cream (at least 33% fat content, 40% is better; you can use only 4 cups of cream) or 6-7 cups if making 12X18 rectangular shape cake 1 – 1½ cups sugar (1 cup if using 4 cups of cream) 2-3 tablespoons vanilla extract  Chocolate Drizzle 100g. dark chocolate, chopped ½ cup heavy cream, heated almost to boiling point Also 500g. raspberry 200 g. blueberry, rinsed and dried 200 g. blackberry, rinsed and dried 1lb strawberry, rinsed & dried, sliced 5 ripe bananas, sliced or any other combination and amount of fruits/berries you like  Instructions Prep Turn the oven to 200 F. Cut out 3, 9.5-10 inch circles from parchment paper. With a marker, draw a 8 – 8.5 inch circle in the middle of each piece of parchment. Turn the parchment over and place each parchment circle over 9 inch round pan, set aside (you can use layered aluminum foil if you don’t have 3, 9 inch round pans). Prepare a large pastry bag (or a gallon size zip-lock bag) fitted with a large star tip. Set aside. Take a small zip-lock bag, open it, drape the sides over a glass/cup.  Meringue In a bowl of an electric mixer, fitted with a whip attachment, whip room temperature egg whites with cream of tartar/citric acid, starting with low speed and gradually increasing it as the egg whites begin to take shape and increase in volume.  With the mixer still running and once the egg whites become white and foamy, start adding the sugar, one tablespoon at a time. Continue beating until stiff peaks form . Careful not to over whip, or you will have to start over. Over whipped meringue looks chunky and broken, whereas properly whipped meringue looks glossy and smooth.  Fill the prepared pastry bag with meringue and in a swirl motion pipe the meringue inside the circles on the parchment paper. Place it on top of 9 inch baking pan bottoms, or upside down pans. Try not to get out of boundaries as the meringue will expand in the oven. Each circle should be about ¾- 1 inch in height, if your pastry tip is not large enough to make it that tall in one layer, just make another spiral layer on top.  side note: it’s best to make 2 thicker meringue layers and one thinner. The two thicker will be the two bottom layers and the thinner one will be on top. The two bottom layers will absorb a lot more moisture then the top, as the bottom will do so from the weight and the middle one will do so because of being surrounded by whip cream from both sides  Place the pans in the 200F oven and dry for 10-12 hours. You can leave it in the oven overnight. The lower the temperature the whiter the meringue will be. If you can lower the oven to 180F, do so and extend the drying time.  Chantilly Cream In a chilled bowl of an electric mixer, fitted with a chilled whip attachment whip start whipping cold heavy cream, going from lower to higher speeds as it thickens. Once the cream is somewhat fluffy, add the sugar and vanilla extract and again start with low speeds and all the way to the highest speed, until the heavy cream is whipped to stiff peaks. Place in the refrigerator until ready to use (not more then 30 minutes).  Chocolate Drizzle Heat the cream until boiling. Pour over chopped chocolate. Let sit for a minute or two and then mix with the spoon until smooth. Pour into the prepared zip-lock bag. Close the end and snip off the corner of the bag.  Assembly:  Drizzle the chocolate over all meringue layer, place in freezer to harden, 3-4 minutes Reserve 2 cups of frosting for decoration and place in the fridge. Prepare your berries. On a serving dish, put a dab of Chantilly Cream, place the first meringue layer and press gently to adhere. Spoon or pipe ¼ of the frosting on top of the meringue layer. Layer out the bananas and cover with ¼ of the frosting. Layer half of all the berries on top. Press them in gently. Place a couple of dabs of cream on top for the next meringue layer to adhere.  Place the 2nd meringue layer and repeat with the fruits. Place the 3rd meringue layer (thinnest) and make 8 swirls all around the edge. Cut strawberries in half and place one half on each swirl, sliced side up. Place back in the fridge immediately, until serving time.  Notes Make the cake at least 2-3 hours before serving, but not more then 6 hours before serving.  Keep the cake in the fridge until it's almost time to serve. It's natural for the cream to separate if it stays at room temperature for too long.  Meringue layers can be made up two 2 days in advance, but must be kept in an airtight container (wrapped in shrink wrap), to prevent moisture from being absorbed by the meringue.  If the cake must be transported, let the cake sit in the fridge for 2-3 hours before doing so, otherwise the layers will start going separate ways, or the cake will crack and ooze to sides."

Baking,3a2aek,LoraxlRose,12,Tue Jun 16 17:49:57 2015 UTC,Corn starch. And refrigerate the dough before baking.
Baking,3a2aek,Melenna,2,Tue Jun 16 18:03:46 2015 UTC,I use powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar.  Same effect I would guess.
Baking,3a2aek,aggiespartan,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:56:53 2015 UTC,I refuse to tell any of my friends this so they always beg me for my cookies.
Baking,3a2aek,dougiemeowserMD,12,Tue Jun 16 22:33:38 2015 UTC,"What have you tried? Also, what type of cookies? I find that I get chewier cookies when I use more brown than white sugar. Making sure your butter (or whatever fat you use) is the right consistency makes a big difference in chewiness as well. Also, you may just be baking them for too long - I sliiiiightly underbake cookies usually and let them cool for a few minutes on the cookie sheet before I move them to a cooling rack.  Hope something here helps."
Baking,3a2aek,AdamantiumFoil,4,Tue Jun 16 18:11:50 2015 UTC,I agree. Try under baking them slightly.
Baking,3a2aek,bebble,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:20:03 2015 UTC,"Yes to all of this, and I usually add a little condensed milk too:)"
Baking,3a2aek,ninjajandal,7,Tue Jun 16 21:35:47 2015 UTC,"For chocolate chip cookies use a recipe that includes Brown sugar. Trust me. Let the butter soften, so take it out of the fridge with plenty of time prior to making your dough.( this can help with any kind of cookie)  Let the dough set in the fridge for like a half hour.  Put cookies in oven and just as the start to brown, (like 2-4 mins prior to recommended time on your recipe)  take those soft bad boys out. Perfect everytime."
Baking,3a2aek,psycminded,4,Tue Jun 16 19:53:47 2015 UTC,"Try adding some form of syrup: maple syrup (the real stuff, preferably), corn syrup, molasses, agave, etc. A couple tablespoons will do, or as much as 1/4 cup if you also remove an egg from your recipe.  Others have mentioned that using brown sugar instead of white will help, that's in a similar vein. Brown sugar is just white sugar with some molasses."
Baking,3a2aek,mycatisbetterthanyou,3,Tue Jun 16 19:00:59 2015 UTC,"These are my go-to chocolate chip cookies, and they're wonderful.  Brown sugar and chilling the dough before baking."
Baking,3a2aek,SpiderArcana,3,Tue Jun 16 18:25:49 2015 UTC,"most of these comments involve modifying ingredients, what my wife does is transfer them to a wire rack right after they get out of the oven, let them cool for about 15 minutes, then store in a plastic container... always chewy..."
Baking,3a2aek,dew_wino_hue,2,Tue Jun 16 20:21:36 2015 UTC,"I do this too. Underbake them just a little bit and let them set on the rack. If you try to eat them immediately they'll fall all to (delicious) pieces, but once they've cooled the texture is perfect.  The recipe I use has rolled oats ground into coarse flour as well, dunno if that helps the chewiness. Sure is tasty."
Baking,3a2aek,noc33,3,Tue Jun 16 21:36:57 2015 UTC,"My biggest suggestions are to bake until the lowest end of the range (or until barely golden, based on recipe), and then take them out, allow to cool on the pan 2-5 mins and the move to a cooling rack. As soon as the are cool to the touch and not sticky on the bottoms, store in an airtight container to maintain freshness. I've never kept cookies for an extended time (-___-), but those who do, I've heard leaving a piece of bread in the container will keep moisture in the cookies as well."
Baking,3a2aek,ThePetitePanettiere,2,Tue Jun 16 21:08:17 2015 UTC,An extra egg yolk.  Edit - that's what I do for my chewy peanut butter cookies and it's delish!
Baking,3a2aek,c8h10n4o2junkie,2,Tue Jun 16 20:05:30 2015 UTC,Keep it simple.    Melt or soften your butter.  Refrigerate for up to an hour before baking.  Under bake the cookies.    I use a thin gray cookie sheet. (I'm a broke 20 something dude.) Don't know if that matters. Just putting it out there. I only make oatmeal raisin or sugar cookies and they are always super chewy and well liked by my Co workers.

Baking,3a2aek,Tillysnow1,1 point,Sat Jun 20 11:09:51 2015 UTC,"Do you know if your oven runs at the temp you think its at? If it's old, it may benefit you to get a stand alone thermometer so that you actually know. If it's small, you may not be getting the air circulation required for a good bake, try smaller sheets.   Then, underbake, but not by too much. Let the cookies sit on the sheet for 5-10 minutes after removing them from the oven, then transfer to a cooling rack.  I follow the recipe on the Trader Joes Chocolate Chips bag but add some extra vanilla. (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/member/views/trader-joes-choc-chip-cookies-50075515). No strange syrups, starches, or chilling.  I never have any problems. Everyone loves my cookies"
Baking,3a28eb,ThePetitePanettiere,5,Tue Jun 16 17:36:06 2015 UTC,"I definitely think Silpats are a luxury. I actually don't even like mine for the fact that it's a pain in the ass to store and clean. Directions said to store it perfectly flat, and to never use soap, just wipe it clean. Not so easy when it attracts dust and little bits like a damn magnet.  It doesn't do anything parchment paper doesn't do and Silpats are expensive."
Baking,3a28eb,sexytimespanda,5,Tue Jun 16 18:17:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Also for luxury: the cake leveler, the cake turner/stand, and about 80% of the piping and decoration equpiment. A lot can be done with a little and very good things can happen with mediocre tools."
Baking,3a28eb,HIBITCH,2,Tue Jun 16 19:03:26 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I think she has a very loose definition of the term essential.  Loaf and Pie pans?  Maybe maybe a loaf pan if you're going to make all your bread instead of buy, but I can count on one hand how many people I know who bake enough pies to consider it an essential.  And I'm not included.  I can also count on one hand how many times I've used my pie pan in the 2 years I've had it.    If I whittled her list down, I would break it into 3 categories:  Bare Essentials, Will Use Often, and Luxury  Bare Essentials (i.e. Poor College Student trying to save money by cooking more at home)   13 x 9 Cookie Sheets or Jelly Roll (Jelly Roll is probably a bit more versatile) Silicone Spatulas Measuring Cups (liquid and dry) Microwave Food Storage Containers (could be reused yogurt, sour cream or cottage cheese containers) Mixing Bowls (at least one large)   Will Use Often (i.e. Graduated college, have a full time job, and want to start beefing up your kitchen with a bit of your new-found cash)   Cupcake/Muffin Tins (regular and/or small) Circle Baking Pans Loaf Pan Pie Plate Whisk Electric Hand Mixer (worth it to spend a little extra on it) Blender Slow Cooker:  A full sized one depending on your baking style, could go in the Bare Essentials, especially if you can find a good deal.  I see no reason for a mini one to melt candy/chocolates (based on my baking style). Rolling Pin Cake Caddy with Lid (I have one that collapses and has cupcake trays that will stack and fit inside.  I highly recommend it)   Luxury Items  (i.e. Wedding Registry or I have the money/space after all my 2nd tiered items)   Non-Stick Baking Mats Ice Cream Scoop Immersion Blender Stand Mixer Decorating Supplies (Icing Bags, Tips, Spatulas, Fondant Roller, Turntable/Stand):  Could be a 2nd tier item if you will use it enough.  I'm only considering this a luxury item because for many it will sit in a drawer/cabinet gathering dust until it's used once or twice a year. Egg Container Butter Crock   That's just how I would break it down."

Or, thicker layers will work if your pan/form is small (6 inches or less diameter). Alternatively, you could do a tie-dye style cake that will have the same cool impact, but you could do a two or three layer and it will likely all be consumed! Best of luck! Also, I think gel dyes are the way to go. They sell them in most Vons/Pavillions markets that I've seen (US), and of course wilton and americolor are widely available in store and online (but are price-yer per color."

Baking,39weiu,EvilSpaceBunny,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:58:51 2015 UTC,"Actually looks like there's too many, to me. Croissants get 4 half-folds, tops. Too many, and no matter how cool you keep it, you're going to get delamination as the butter melts into the dough."
Baking,39weiu,Tradyk,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:41:22 2015 UTC,A total of 4 turns although I'm not sure I'm doing it correctly. Maybe I'll check out some Youtube videos...

Baking,39weiu,Torianism,2,Mon Jun 15 14:45:45 2015 UTC,"They were okay. A bit doughy in the middle. I need to figure out why that happened...I think that I rolled them too tight and also, I need to make my own butter. The butter they sell in stores here doesn't have enough fat content."

Baking,39weiu,SarahJujitsu,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:58:33 2015 UTC,"I think it is the heat applied at the bottom of the croissant.  Try baking them on a piece of steel about 1/2"" thick, like a baking steel.  The heat capacity of the steel is really high compared to that of air and the thermal capacity of steel is 18x high than that of stone.  Air is very bad at both.  The heat from the steel will shoot up into the interior of the croissant and make billowy pockets of air and flaky crust."

Baking,39weiu,VictoriaSnowww,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:28:16 2015 UTC,"Also... You can see where butter was breaking - this can be an issue with butter that is just a bit too cold, or your fridge being too cold and you not letting it sit for enough time after pulling, before the next turn. Do not be discouraged however, croissants are difficult and rewarding. Try another batch!"
Baking,39weiu,VictoriaSnowww,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:14:46 2015 UTC,How cold should my fridge be for the ideal temperature? I let them sit longer in the fridge than the recipe calls for. I am going to try until I master croissants! Any tips are greatly appreciated.
Baking,39weiu,MrBabyMan_,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:10:00 2015 UTC,"I would set your fridge for medium on its dial, 30 minutes in, 10 minutes out, and you need 9 turns for croissant. The only other thing I can of is to make sure your de tremp looks right, it should not look like dough really, it should look more like a mess than anything.  Are you located in the states?"

Baking,39ztg4,deadpickle,2,Tue Jun 16 02:59:41 2015 UTC,"Technique-wise, I always find it helpful to mix the dough roughly together, then let it rest for about 20-30 minutes to let the flour soak up the water before I knead the dough.  Also, I find with some really soft doughs, that they only stop being kinda soupy towards the end of kneading, finally forming a slightly more cohesive mass and coming smoothly away from the bowl. (this is after 7-8minutes of kneading.   Another thing: Some doughs are just really soft, so I spritz cooking spray over the dough during its last turn of kneading in the mixer, so the dough is less prone to sticking to the bowl. Then I spritz my hands with cooking spray when I touch the dough (getting it out of the bowl). Let it rise for the first time, oiled in a bowl, then put it out on a greased counter and spread it out. Fold it together on itself (like a business letter edges in to the center), and put the dough back in the bowl for a second rise before shaping.   IMO, it's all about resisting the urge to add more flour, and finding ways to avoid it."

I live in Hawaii and I always reduce the amount of liquid I start with because my flour is damp (I even keep it in the fridge. ) have you tried reducing the water you start with? Try a few tablespoons less to start and see how it goes.

No flaxseed or other, I used this recipe:   1 cup soy milk with 1 tsp of vinegar/250ml buttermilk  3/4 cup granulated sugar/170g caster sugar  1/3 cup canola oil/80ml sunflower oil  1 1/2 tsp vanilla  1 cup all-purpose flour/170g plain flour  1/3 cup/40g cocoa powder  3/4 tsp bicarbonate of soda (baking soda)  1/2 tsp baking powder  1/4 tsp salt  (Recipe conversions are done by myself. Use either cup or gram side, not both)  If using soy milk and vinegar; mix together and set aside for 5 minutes before adding the next three ingredients.  If using buttermilk; Mix together the first four ingredients and set aside.  Sift together the last five ingredients into a bowl.  Mix wet ingredients with dry and fill paper cases 3/4 full.

Baking,39z91g,cucumberbun,2,Tue Jun 16 00:07:28 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about making something like pancake dry mix but for cinnamon rolls? If so the thing I would worry about is the yeast being in the mason jar. If you want to add all the other dry ingredients it should be fine. As for gooey, that depends on the filling, icing and the proofing/baking. So it would be hard to control that from just sending dry ingredients. I hope that helps!"

Seeing as no one provided advice I figured I would make an attempt to help.  I recently did mason jar cakes for a summer wedding that had a country theme and used mason jars.  The cake I made was a yogurt cake (after baking topped with sliced strawberries and topped with honey whipped cream).  I poured in the batter using a funnel to keep the batter from getting on the sides. I put the jars into a cookie sheet with sides (a cooking pan?!?), and then filled the pan with water.  I put this inot the oven.  The water help  keep it from burnt.  I would try this jar/pan/water method.  Also you might get good results from short mason jars  Good luck!"

Baking,3a102v,autowikibot,7,Tue Jun 16 12:25:54 2015 UTC,"Aha, what you are making is clarified butter. You are removing the water (and probably some milk solids) from the butter leaving just the butterfat. You can also buy ghee (common in India), which is similar. It is clarified butter that has been cooked a little longer and imparts a little nutty flavor."
Baking,3a102v,jabbajosh,2,Tue Jun 16 14:32:05 2015 UTC,"Clarified butter:       Clarified butter is milk fat rendered from butter to separate the milk solids and water from the butterfat.  Typically, it is produced by melting butter and allowing the components to separate by density. The water evaporates, some solids float to the surface and are skimmed off, and the remainder of the milk solids sink to the bottom and are left behind when the butter fat (which would then be on top) is poured off.  Commercial methods of production also include direct evaporation, but may also be accomplished by decantation and centrifugation followed by vacuum drying; or direct from cream by breaking the emulsion followed by centrifugation.

I had several people at the party touch the hunny pot because they thought it was ceramic or at least fondant, because l got it so smooth and shiny. I was pretty proud.  Unfortunately it was a hot day and the frosting stated to slump and run before the cake was served, but we got some great pictures beforehand and it tasted just as good!  Next year's mission: learn how the hell to actually cut a cake like that hunny pot."
Baking,39wi83,ddddamn,3,Mon Jun 15 11:05:40 2015 UTC,"My personal experience with green tea flavor has mostly been with matcha. Matcha clumps like crazy, so I always try to whisk it in a sieve to dissolve. I actually find that matcha has quite a strong taste and is fairly bitter. Green tea powder is often bitter as well, but has less of the fresh green tea taste (flavor/texture consistency also varies between more brands).       Flavor wise, I like to pair green tea with something sweet and creamy to balance out the bitterness in the tea. Matcha and white chocolate, sweetened condensed milk, honey, azuki(red bean), ginger, cinnamon (surprisingly), seasame, mascarpone, coconut, pomelo, and almond are my favorites. Green tea and cream just belong together in food heaven <3.       I'm not a huge fan of green tea flavoring in cakes, I think it's because the bitterness in the tea makes the texture of the cake seem drier than it is, but that might just be personal. Some of my favorite recipes are green tea vanilla panna cotta, which I actually prefer to make with brewed green tea instead of matcha powder, I also substitute sweetened condensed milk for the sugar. Green tea mille-crepe has become really popular lately, takes some effort to make but looks pretty impressive. I like to use a white chocolate pastry cream and pomelo/yuzu jam to fill and garnish. Mochi is a classic, I like to use either a red bean (azuki) or black sesame seed paste filling.         Good luck with your green tea experimentations!"
Baking,39wi83,fitzbender,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:00:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I actually just bought a can of green tea powder on a whim when I saw it at the Korean market the other night. I have no idea if it's green tea powder or matcha, though. Do you have any brands that you might suggest? Are there any powders that are made specifically for baking/creaming?  Yes, I agree with you. I love the sweet and green tea pairings. My favorite ice cream/frozen yogurt flavor is green tea/matcha and I can't get enough of the taste! You can taste the slight bitterness and the rich flavor of the tea with that hint of creamy sweetness... it's like a taste of bliss.   Also, thanks for the recipe recommendations! Both of them look really good. Before you posted this response though, I went recipe scouring and found this one for a matcha chocolate mousse cake and I think I will try making this first."
Baking,39wi83,fitzbender,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:06:27 2015 UTC,"No problem, just sharing the love of green tea! If it says green tea powder, it's usually green tea powder and not matcha. You'll find that matcha is a lot more expensive because matcha is harvested from its unique type of plant, the leaves are then steamed, air dried, and finally ground. Green tea can be picked from various sorts of tea plants, roasted (not sure if that's the right term) dry, and then finally ground into green tea powder. Green tea powder can also be ground from the stems or veins of the plant whereas matcha is only from the leaves, resulting in a more potent flavor. Depending on what the plants are roasted dry in, the tea can sometimes pick up a metallic flavor, again reducing the purity of taste.   I typically use green tea  powder in recipes where there will be many other flavors, especially if I'm baking,  and reserve matcha powder for when there are fewer elements, but that might just be preference. I do confess though, I use green tea powder a lot more often! I just add a little extra green tea powder if the recipe is calling for matcha. This is the matcha powder I use, it's a good price for matcha but obviously still pretty pricey. (I also drink a lot of matcha).     That mousse cake looks amazing, please share your results if you get around to it!"
Baking,39wi83,fitzbender,2,Mon Jun 15 15:37:42 2015 UTC,"Hey, so I actually found that there is specially made matcha just for baking! Apparently it's recommended to use this over brewing matcha since a lot of the matcha flavor can be lost when used in cooking so they came up with a different blend just for cooking. It also helps that it's much cheaper than ones made for drinking as well. You might want to check this out next time you bake!"

I like having a board under the cake for lifting/transport/icing purpose.   You can use the outline of the custom base you made to section off the center of the board and cut that part of the fondant out, and use icing to cover the seam. That's how I think I would go about if I needed a fondant covered board.  I hope that helps."

Baking,39qncy,Oz_ghoti,3,Sun Jun 14 11:16:37 2015 UTC,"One way I've done it in the past is to have a photocopy of the picture underneath some baking paper (tape them both to a board so you can move them but they stay together) and basically colour it in with the icing.  The ones I did you colour in 'backwards', ie. the stuff on the outside of the picture (eyebrows, clothing etc) is done first and the background over the top of that and then you freeze it - the picture then peels off the paper and you can lay it directly on your cake (make sure your cake is flat on top) so the bit directly on the baking paper becomes the front of the picture.  Does that even make sense?  I'll see if I can find a picture of my first attempt to give you an idea - Christmas cake topper  I also made some really cute 'dumb ways to die' cupcake toppers - They're a bit rough but they were a trial and for a play date so I didn't care too much"

Baking,39ttze,robertdeutsch,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:39:52 2015 UTC,"The only differences between these and my recipe, are I use 1 cup each of brown and white sugar and 3 cups unsifted flour, nix the butterscotch extract. I have been baking since I can remember and finally found that this recipe is solid A+ every time. I also add pecans or walnuts depending on who I'm making them for and if they like nuts. I also find that the way you place the dough onto the baking sheet affects how the texture of the cookie is. Sometimes I just lump them on, sometimes I roll them into balls first. Both turn out looking very different and they keep differently as well. The balls tend to get that perfectly crispy on the edges and gooey in the center factor. Also, recently I added a spice mixture from the tea and spice exchange called ""bakers secret"" and it enhances the flavor a ton but you have to be careful not to add too much.  Sorry for the wall, just thought I'd add this in case anyone is interested in trying this recipe as well as yours!"

Just put heavy cream/whipping cream in a rice cooker on warm, leave it for 12 hours, and then leave it in the fridge for a couple hours to cool. Once it's cool, skim the solid part off the top, put it in a container, mix it up, and put it back in the fridge for about an hour to firm back up. It was delicious and ridiculously easy."

I'm always tempted to add more to try and get that type of deep dish, mega-tall quiche you get in bakeries, the towering ones that almost look like a cheesecake. But then they end up taking forever to bake, 90 minutes or more, with baking usually punctuated by me going to slice it and discovering it's still liquid in the centre beneath the crust. Then I end up vowing never again to make quiche for dinner because it's getting so late.  Yours looks really good. Flat and wide, nothing wrong with that. From looking at it, I wouldn't have said anything about the ratios was off.  I recently found pumpkin, diced and baked until tender, is really good in quiche, especially with bacon. Or in egg and bacon pie. And a little allspice for seasoning, so nice."

Baking,39rr54,01111000marksthespot,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:53:43 2015 UTC,"I had the complete wrong approach when I first (last) made pastry cream. I thought it would be best to gently heat it to avoid scrambling the egg yolks. Apparently you're meant to do the opposite, and use a very high heat to bring it up to temperature extremely quickly, to denature the proteins in the yolk or something like that, which is critical to get the proper texture."
Baking,39rr54,pianobritt,2,Sun Jun 14 09:15:41 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's exactly right. That's why it's deceptively difficult. You need to coagulate the proteins to just the right amount to build structure without scrambling your eggs; there's nothing worse than chunks of cooked egg in your pastry cream. Also, if you're using starch (and I believe almost if not all recipes call for it to thicken)- make sure that it boils for EXACTLY 60 seconds to get rid of that starchy mouthfeel"

You have to be really careful. I would suggest using a bit more coloring for the marzipan. And when you dip the ends in chocolate, I have found that it's easier if you dip one end, let it cool in the fridge, then dip the other.   Also, your recipe doesn't look that great. These must be really dry inside... I usually use crumbs from ""sockerkaka"" (cupcakes should be fine) and run them in the food process to get them really fine. Then mix with powdered sugar, cocoa powder, butter, vanilla sugar and arak."

I've been using the same ones for ages, knotted inside a turkey roasting bag. To keep it clean I layer foil or parchment paper on top of the raw crust, then add the bag full of beans.   Also, the bag makes it easier to remove the pie weights.  You can also use coins/pennies, I've read that idea, but I never have that much loose change around."

Baking,39q2eh,01111000marksthespot,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:24:28 2015 UTC,"I decided I wanted to make jelly bean cookies, which seem self-justifying once the idea's in your head. Most of the ones I found on google failed to inspire, so I ended up just adding jelly beans to a cookie recipe I already like, which is a closely adapted but more chocolatey version of this Jacques Torres recipe.  The result was pretty good! Unfortunately not perfect: the teeth-stickingly chewy texture of jelly beans is not a perfect match with cookie and chocolate, forcing you to keep sucking and chewing on the candy for a little while after you swallow everything else. Not a deal-breaker, but perhaps something that could be refined with more testing. Or maybe it's unavoidable.  Originally I intended to use mini jelly beans like Jelly Bellys or a generic equivalent, as I hoped the smaller morsels would work better, but I couldn't get hold of any. Using those, or chopping all or some of the jelly beans in half, may give you better results.  Definitely pick through your jelly beans and get rid of any flavours you don't like before you add them to the mix. Mine had some white ones with a nasty coconut flavour.  As you can see, the jelly beans melted slightly in the oven. Some on the base and edges of the cookies melted and re-solidified, gaining a more brittle texture and very slight burnt sugar flavour. Some became totally glassy and translucent, which was interesting. Most ended up with the slightly shrivelled texture you can see. They baked for 15 minutes at 350ºF/175ºC, which there is no getting around with this cookie recipe. If you were to incorporate jelly beans into a sugar cookie recipe with a shorter baking time, you may be able to get them baked without affecting their appearance at all.  I used metric cups for the dry ingredients, which are 1 cup = 250ml. US cups are 235ml, so be sure to add that little bit more flour and sugar. I know I should list ingredients by weight but hey whatevs.  Jelly bean choc chunk cookies Yields 25 50g/1.75oz cookies.  1 2/3 cups plain flour 1/2 cup dutch-processed cocoa 1/2 tsp baking soda 1/2 tsp baking powder 3/4 tsp salt 145g unsalted butter 2/3c brown sugar 2/3c white sugar 1 egg 1 tsp vanilla extract 100g chocolate (I used semisweet baking chocolate chopped into 1/4-1/3"" chunks; choc chips are fine too) 250g jelly beans  Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.  Using a stand mixer, cream the butter and sugars thoroughly until very creamy and fluffy. Add the egg and mix well, then the vanilla. Mix in the flour mixture all at once on a low speed until the dough just comes together. By hand, stir in the jelly beans and chocolate.  Gather up the dough, wrap tightly in clingfilm, and refrigerate for 24 hours.  Preheat oven to 175ºC/350ºF and line your baking sheets with baking paper. Scoop up 50g/1.75oz balls of dough, using scales to portion each one precisely. Try to get an even distribution of jelly beans in each one, and add more jelly beans if you like. Press them together with your hands to ensure the jelly beans are held firmly by the dough. Place on the tray and gently press down to slightly flatten them, again pressing them back together if they break apart at all.  Bake for 15 minutes, until lightly golden on top (which is pretty hard to see with chocolate cookies, but you know what a cooked cookie looks like). Cool on tray for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.  Store in an airtight container. Cookies will develop in texture over about 24 hours, and end up firm but with slightly soft centres."

Baking,39k5q7,Presently42,-27,Fri Jun 12 11:50:29 2015 UTC,"Friends feel quite insecure about eating my pies when I have a nearly perfect body and healthy lifestyle (exercise and diet). Noone would take a whole pie and I dont want to give away slices and throw away the rest.  There are places where you can donate leftover food from catering and such to the poor, kind of like soup kitchen. I take pies there if I used an aluminium foil dish baking it. If it's a custard pie, I also also take it out of the pyrex and give it away. But if it's a fruit pie et cetera; I give it away to the neighbors: WHICH IS UNHEARD OF in Finnish culture. I'm pretty sure some of the girls just throw it away, fearing poison :)"

The problem is my hands are extremely warm, my fingers are extremely manly and large. Those girls have the fingers of a child! Probably cold like ice too.

Baking,39h90k,Malephus,5,Fri Jun 12 02:58:44 2015 UTC,Not OP but I have a thought on that. My process would be to make white modeling chocolate and knead the orange dye into it. Just dying melted chocolate and cooling it into squares wouldn't make that nice rough cheesy edge to it.
Baking,39h90k,PloniAlmoni1,2,Fri Jun 12 03:02:25 2015 UTC,You need oil based coloring when adding color to chocolate - Wilton makes special oil based colored - you cant use the standard gel colours.

Baking,39gpw5,OperatingOnScientist,3,Thu Jun 11 16:38:28 2015 UTC,Thank you very much. I just posted the recipe in the comment section for anyone interested.
Baking,39gpw5,ogunshay,14,Fri Jun 12 05:22:19 2015 UTC,"As quite a few people have asked for the recipe I had to do some translating and unit converting, as the original recipe is in German.  Ingredients:   4 large eggs 1 pinch of salt 280 grams/1.5 cups of sugar 140 grams/1 cup of flour 140 grams/1.25 cups of melted butter 200 grams/1 cup of full fat cream cheese 150 grams/0.5 cups of full fat yogurt 100 grams/0.5 cups of pureed strawberries 100 grams/0.5 cups of chopped strawberries 400 grams/2 cups of halved strawberries 200 grams/1 cup of whipping cream 60 grams/4 tbsps of sugar 2 packages/2 tbsps of vanilla sugar 6 gelatin sheets 1 package of red cake glaze   Optional for decoration:   heavy cream 2 packages/2 tbsps of vanilla sugar almond slices   As I personally try to avoid meat in my daily life I've replaced the gelatin leaves with 3grams/1 tsp of agar powder that I dissolved with 100 ml/0.5 cups of milk and used homemade strawberry jam instead of the red cake glaze. I'll write down both varieties below.  Method:  Preheat your oven to 180° Celsius/350° Fahrenheit. Separate 3 of the eggs and beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until stiff. Mix the 3 egg yolks and remaining egg with the sugar and beat until frothy. Add the flour little at a time to your egg sugar mixture and afterwards mix in the melted butter. Finally, carefully fold your egg whites into your cake batter.  At this point the original recipe bakes half of the dough for 20 minutes and than the other half (of course this can be done in parallel if you have two cake forms). Alternatively you could probably also bake it all at once for about 30-35 minutes and cut it in half afterwards. Leave to cool at this point.  For the filling mix the cream cheese with the yogurt, sugar, vanilla sugar and pureed strawberries. Prepare your gelatin according to the instructions on the package and mix it in. Put it in the fridge for 10-15 minutes to let the gelatin solidify a little. In the mean time whip your whipping cream and lift it into your cream filling after you take it out of the fridge together with the chopped strawberries.  If you are using Agar powder instead of gelatin, mix the cream cheese with 100ml/0.5 cups of milk in and the Agar powder in a pot. Let it sit for about 5 minutes. While you wait mix all the other ingredients for the filling (yogurt, sugar, vanilla sugar, pureed and chopped strawberries as well as the whipped cream) together. Heat up the agar cream cheese mix and let it simmer for about 1 minute. Mix a couple of tablespoons of the yogurt mixture into your agar cream to temper it a little and finally combine both mixtures completely.  Now put the first half of your cake in a cake ring, top it with the filling you just completed and put the second half on top. Arrange your halved strawberries on top of the cake, prepare the cake glaze (or melt some strawberry jam in the microwave) according to instructions and spoon it over the strawberries from the inside out.  Put the cake in the fridge and let it rest for at least 3 hours.  If you want to make the cake even more glorious, roast some almond slices (and let them cool), beat the heavy cream stiff with the vanilla sugar and cover the sides of the cake with the cream followed by the roasted almonds.  Enjoy!"
Baking,39gpw5,ogunshay,2,Fri Jun 12 05:20:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the translation! By leaves of gelatin, is there a chance you mean sachets / envelopes / packages?"
Baking,39gpw5,Delicatefukinflower,5,Fri Jun 12 06:17:44 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I think I used the wrong word. It's actually gelatin sheets (that's how it's commonly sold in Germany).  I did some quick checking and from what I can tell it corresponds with roughly 3 teaspoons of Gelatin powder (around 10 grams). The amount used corresponds roughly with the amount you would usually use on 2 cups of liquid."

Baking,39hme3,F_ckYeahTestudo,2,Fri Jun 12 18:25:22 2015 UTC,"Half a kg of sour cherries with half a cup of sugar in the oven, for 30 minutes 'till the sugar is melted and the cherries will start getting juicy.  Tº: 390 F/200 C.  Meanwhile, separate the yolks from the whites from 4 large eggs (or 5 small). Beath the whites (with any kind of mixer) separately untill they're getting all foamy and stiff. Then add 4 tablespoons (heaping) of sugar and beat them again until the sugar is at least aprtially melted and the composition is smooth. Or just follow these instructions.  In another bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil or melted butter with the yolks.   Add the oily yolks with the egg whites slowly, mixing them up and down, slowly, and not by stirring them (because stirring will make the egg whites lose their consistency and air).   You also need 4 tablespoons (heaping) of white flour and a teaspoon of baking powder + a pinch of salt. Mix these and add them gradually, again up and down, not stirred, with the egg whites and yolks. You don't blend the flour perfectly, because you'll see if you got small pockets of flour when you pour the mix on the cherries, so you can even it out right then and there.  And about the cherries. When they're done, just take them out, pour the above mixture on them (you can take some syrup out of the tray if it's too much; the fruits don't need to sit like they're in a puddle) and shove the tray back in the oven at a 320ºF (160ºC) for another 45 minutes.  After it's done, just let it cool and then just turn it upside down on another tray.  This is pretty much it."

Baking,39gqbo,UtWeeks,3,Thu Jun 11 16:37:37 2015 UTC,"The first thing that comes to mind is maybe the egg whites weren't whipped enough, or that when you incorporated them into the batter you beat them around too much and broke them down. Alton Brown did a fantastic episode on souffles on Good Eats where he talks about incorporating egg whites into a batter. I've followed it, and it's fool-proof.   Divide the whites into thirds, and the first third you mix in without caring about breaking down the whites. You're just trying to get a homogenous mixture that is becoming more airy. The second third you fold in more carefully, but still not being super-duper cautious. That's for the last third. That's the careful, easy-does-it folding of the egg whites into the mixture to make sure volume isn't lost.   Another thing is you might not have creamed the butter and sugar together long enough. When I do cookies and cakes, I'll let the mixer go for a good while. It's really difficult to over-cream a mixture. Just make sure the butter is nice and soft and you'll be golden.   Try it again. And again, and again, and again. Remember: Baking is a science. Sometimes it takes a few experiments to get the desired result."
Baking,39gqbo,exzyle2k,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:02:39 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, you might be right. I didn't know what I was doing when I folded in the egg whites, and yea, the butter and sugar might not have been whisked enough. Thanks for the tips =). I'll look up the video and also continue to practice."

The cake is root beer chocolate falvoured (you can find my recipe here). It was actually an adapted version of a Guinness chocolate cake recipe, sans Guinness.   The toppings were: buttered popcorn, chips, Starburst candies, sour keys, licorice, pretzels, and a melted chocolate drizzle.

Thus, two different temperatures, two different consistences. However, it could have been one of the other ideas listed, or a combination."

As others have said, maybe your recipe and instructions were faulty?   From what I remember, shaped doughs like that need careful handling, and need to be at just the right texture and temperature both when shaping and baking to turn out picture perfect.   I haven't done it in a long time, I don't usually have enough patience for that kind of thing except during the holidays when I want to make something that's really good looking for cookie plates. (Most of the time I go for flavor, not looks, but sometimes I want to make something really pretty.)   The fussiest recipe I rely on is for maple leaf sugar cookies that you have to roll out between layers of parchment, then chill the dough, cut out shapes and cook while they're still cold so they hold their shape. They taste so good it's worth it, every few years.   How'd they taste, though? Hope they're at least good enough to eat."

This is because you don't know the territory.  You need to develop an intuitive knowledge of the rules of a given area, and the only way to get that, is with lots, and lots, and LOTS of practice.  I never expect to be good at any new activity, and I virtually never am.  On the other hand, I've been shell scripting for close to twenty years now.  Every time I think I've finally developed a solid understanding of how to do it, I discover that there are infinitely better ways.  Those videos that make cooking look so easy, are probably made by chefs who are about as good at cooking as I am with scripting.  For them it is easy, but it is only their level of intimacy with cooking as a subject that makes it so.  If you want to get that good yourself, then you are going to have to train.  There is no way around it."
Baking,39cbw9,DondeT,4,Wed Jun 10 20:24:42 2015 UTC,If you're trying to reach a global audience rather than just an American one I'd advise you to include weight measurements as well as cup ones. It's far more reliable and transferable.    Also as your first post is a cake made from a mix I'd expect a bit more explanation about what else you do. What makes your approach different to all of the other blogs out there that also use cake mix. I like your explanation of what the changes result in with the cake though but I'd like to see at the very least a final picture. If you're trying to introduce your approach to new bakers then progress pictures are really useful too - so they know everything looks as it should or if not then they can see how far through things went wrong.     I'd also link to an icing recipe or two that you think goes well with the cake rather than just saying to ice it - but you might already be planning on this as your blog builds.

Baking,39bz24,jesseholmz,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:04:25 2015 UTC,"Too thick would be my guess. Not enough separation between layers (basting, thus the layers stick, making them just like thicker layers) is possible, but i'm guessing it's the thickness. Can you describe ""tough"" a little more? Like is it chewey? You have a hard time biting through the layers? Or is it too crispy?"
Baking,39bz24,GraveMercy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:12:07 2015 UTC,"a bit too crispy i'd say, it's more like a crust. but maybe that's how it's supposed to be"

The texture and the flavor of the cookie was fine, but I think I used a little to much strawberry extract for the buttercream, and it was also just so sweet, so I think next time I'll just cut back on the sugar in the icing and use pureed strawberries instead of extract to offset some of the sweetness."

Baking,397i0f,Echilon,2,Wed Jun 10 08:00:27 2015 UTC,"I second this. The cake looks so beautiful, and tasty. And easier to transport than your regular cake on a plate."
Baking,397i0f,pumpkinrum,2,Wed Jun 10 14:29:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you both! :)  and yes! so much easier!! :)  Banana cake: *0.5 cup - butter *1.5 cup sugar *1.5 cups mashed banana *2 eggs *1 tspn Vanilla extract *0.5 cup buttermilk *1.5 cups cake flour *0.5 tspn baking soda  butter, sugar, banana, eggs and vanilla all go into a food processor, took me about 2 mins on the highest setting to get everything smooth add the buttermilk, and process for about another minute before adding everything else into the processor. Once everything is combined, add it to your pan and bake at 360 for 30-35 mins  For my cake, since I needed a loot of cake, I doubled the recipe, and added it to a large slab pan.   Chocolate Ganache: *1 cup heavy cream, *1 tspn vanilla *2 cups chocolate of your choice  heat cream and vanilla on the stove until it boils, turn off burner, add the chocolate. Once chocolate is added, cover the bowl for five minutes! once five mins have passed, uncover and stir to combine :)  I suggest making this ahead of time, and letting it set before adding it, as it is hard to pipe unless completely set!  Chocolate Cake: *1 3/4 cups flour *2 cups sugar *3/4 cups cocoa *1 1/2 tspn baking powder *1 1/2 tspn baking soda *1 tspn salt *2 eggs *1 cup milk *1/2 veg oil *2 tspn vanilla  *3/4 cup boiling water   Add the dry ingredients to a mixer, when combined add everything else except for the boiling water! When all is mixed and smooth, add the boiling water and stir by hand. bake at 360 for about 25-30 mins I find this recipe to be very misleading, lol always looks done but when I stick a toothpick in it always needs more time! So be sure to always stick a toothpick in to be 100% sure!  This is a very wet recipe! :) It always gives me issues when I make cupcakes, I usually put the batter into a gravy boat and add it that way :p  and again, I doubled the recipe and baked in large slab pan for my cakes in a jar.   Banana buttercream: *2 cups butter *1 table spoon mashed banana *5 cups icing sugar *1 tsp lemon juice *2 tspn banana extract *1 tspn vanilla *1 tspn heavy cream  put the butter in the mixer, mix until smooth then add bananas, lemon juice, vanilla and banana extract. After about 5 mins add the powdered sugar by the cup, and finally when its combined and smooth add the heavy cream.   To put them together:  I bought mini mason jars, and a cookie cutter the EXACT size of the opening at the top, so that it keeps the icing nice, and in place without any of it leaking down. I was able to slice my banana cake, and chocolate cake in half, so I had two layers of each, and began simply cookie-cutting out my circles :)  I put the banana circles into each jar (A little bit of squeezing them in was in order) and when they got inside I pressed them down gently to make sure they reached the bottom. I then put my ganache in a piping bag, with a large round tip, and piped a generous amount into each jar, atop the banana cake.  I did the same to the chocolate cake that I had done to the banana cake, but I found the chocolate cake to be more ""crumbly"" :) lol so It's definitely a good idea to make a little bit more than you need so you have extra cake to work with!  Then finally, I loaded up my buttercream into a piping back with a large star tip and piped a good amount on top of the choc cake.  I topped it with some sprinkles and loaded them all into the fridge to be eaten the next day!!! :)"

You can replace the lemon with any citrus, blood orange would work, I make it with pink grapefruit a lot and it gets rave reviews.

Whisk together the following:  2 1/4 cups flour  1 tsp baking powder  1tsp baking soda  1/4 tsp white/black pepper (ground)  1/2 tsp cloves (ground)  1/2 tsp cinnamon (ground)  1/4 ginger (ground)  1/4 salt  then in another bowl whisk together:  1 cup white sugar  2 large eggs and 2 large egg yolks  1/2 tsp vanilla extract  Sprinkle the dry ingredients over the wet, fold them in until the dough is just combined  Halve the dough and put them on a baking sheet (you may want to put parchment paper or PAM so they won't stick). Shape them into loaves that are about 13 x 2 inches each  bake for 35 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through  take out, let them cool for ten minutes, lower the oven temp to 325 when you take them out  cut them diagonally in 3/8"" slices. lay them on their side, bake them for 7.5 minutes, take them out, flip them on their opposite side, bake for another 7.5 minutes and you're done!  I've used this recipe dozens of times, if you have any questions let me know!"

Baking,39866a,Flying_Jellyfish,5,Tue Jun 9 23:15:42 2015 UTC,"The coffee is there to enhance to cocoa flavor for a really dark, rich cake. In my experience, if you're not tasting the cakes side by side, the difference isn't terribly noticeable, but it is a nice touch.

Baking,39866a,fitzbender,3,Tue Jun 9 23:39:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not often a coffee drinker, I'll drink it when I'm out but not at home. I have some of this though which I use for a very similar recipe. It also makes a great flavour for cookies and biscotti etc."
Baking,39866a,DondeT,3,Wed Jun 10 13:16:15 2015 UTC,"You could definitely buy some espresso powder and use that - you can enhance any chocolate dessert with it so you will be able to use it again.  If you really want to brew coffee at home without a drip machine, buy ground coffee, and steep it in near-boiling water for a few minutes like you would tea. strain it through a fine strainer (assume you have a tea strainer?) to use. That is basically all there is to French press coffee."

I mixed melted butter, brown sugar, and crushed pineapple for the ""upside down"" part. The pineapple mixture goes in the pan, then the cake batter. After baking, turn the cake upside down and cool, then add the topping/frosting.  The topping is a can of coconut cream whipped with about 1/3 cup of powdered sugar.

Baking,38xb8r,chadwickave,9,Mon Jun 8 03:43:42 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, I'm enjoying the mindfuck :-)   But ok, here's how it goes:   Step 1. Bottom of bowl: layers of shortcake, fruite & whipped cream. Cake gets covered in chestnut puree piped to look like noodles. (A pretty thin layer, relatively speaking.)   Step 2. Noodles get frozen. Then covered in sweetened tea mixed with gelatin, just enough for the noodles to peek out of the top. Once it's set, add accoutrements of your choice.   Step 3. ????   Step 4. Profit!!!"

Baking,38zu11,commander0161,4,Mon Jun 8 05:33:32 2015 UTC,"Foil is mostly used to cover a dish like over a casserole. You can also use it to wrap something and throw it in a campfire or over a grill and cook like a hobo. I believe you can also use it for it's crinkly texture in sugar work.  Wax paper, in the context of baking and pastry, is good for piping chocolate filigree on to let harden for later use as decoration. I can't really think of another use for it seeing as it's wax-coated and that wax will melt off in the oven.  Both are mostly useless in baking. What you'll use a ton of is parchment paper."

The issue is making sure it doesn't collapse while cooling.  It's a little tricky, but can balance the edges of the pan on some cups or cans, so it can cool upside down, the way you'd do with a tube pan.  Also, depending on the amount of batter you have, don't fill the pans any more than half full or you'll risk it overflowing the top."

Baking,38woyy,Clownaround,2,Sun Jun 7 13:56:05 2015 UTC,"Almost all cakes can be done over two days (I actually find this preferable).  Generally, I always bake cake layers in the evening/after work.  Then I let them cool and wrap them well in plastic wrap and aluminum foil and stack them in the freezer with cardboard rounds in between them (so they don' bend or become out of shape).  They'll keep for quite a while in the freezer if well-wrapped, so if I'm on roll, I'll bake a LOT of different layers/flavors (don't forget to label/mark them if you do this!) and then whenever I get hankering or if someone needs a last-minute cake, it's really quick to whip up some buttercream and put a finished cake together in a half hour or less.   Some other make-aheads:  Puff pastry dough.  Generally, this is a long process, so I make a big batch and then divide it up, wrap well and freeze the extra and then save out one part of the batch to make whatever I want the next day.  Pies:  You know how you always see those frozen, ready-to-bake pies at the store?  You can easily make your own at home (if you've got the freezer space).  Obviously this won't work with cream/custard pies, but it's great for fruit pies!"

Baking,38qmis,no1deawhatimdoing,2,Sat Jun 6 00:05:56 2015 UTC,How much flour did you use? I know it says 3-3 1/4 cup. But in the first step it says to combine the 3 cups of flour and all dry ingredients.   And further down in the steps it says to add the remaining flour in one of the mixing stages. Did you happen to forget that 1/4 cup of extra flour?
Baking,38qmis,NoClueHere,2,Sat Jun 6 00:17:23 2015 UTC,"See that's what confused me! I added 3 and ¼ cups in total to the eggs and milk. Was I supposed to add 3 cups then 3 and ¼ cups later? Also, am I supposed to add the flour all at once or slowly?"
Baking,38qmis,NoClueHere,2,Sat Jun 6 01:22:27 2015 UTC,No. As I understood the recipe. You mix the 3 cups with the dry ingredients then mix the dry stuff with the milk and eggs. Then you add the butter. Then you add the 1/4 cup of flour 1 tablespoon at a time until you get the shape you want for your dough.
Baking,38qmis,NoClueHere,2,Sat Jun 6 12:47:05 2015 UTC,I'll try that! Thanks!

Baking,38jtan,mommy2libras,2,Fri Jun 5 05:02:16 2015 UTC,"Since its very smooth looking I would guess that its done with gum paste which is easier to do delicate  work with and can be rolled thinner. If it starts to get dry you can just knead in a little bit of water and it'll be back to normal. You can do that with fondant too as long as it's not too much. I used to knead what I was working with together and then dip it in a cup of water. That was usually enough, however, if it was extra dry I would just repeat the process until it was pliable. (I worked in a wedding cake shop for six years)"
Baking,38jtan,Shortkaik,2,Fri Jun 5 04:53:54 2015 UTC,"OK so would you make something like this on a flat surface first and let it dry before putting it on the cake? Because if it's too moist, I can see it all just drooping into a pile of sad."
Baking,38jtan,kokiri_tagger,2,Fri Jun 5 13:43:48 2015 UTC,"That's what I would do, form them on a flat surface to dry completely before attaching to the cake, probably why most of these are on flat surfaces (square cake or tops of cakes).  Either that or use very small, thin strips and attach securely to the side of the cake if you want it to curve around a round cake.  I need to give this method a try!  I was just recently admiring some like this, didn't know there was a name for it."
Baking,38jtan,Shortkaik,2,Fri Jun 5 14:33:30 2015 UTC,They could also let it dry on a curved surface similar to the curvature of the cake like a dummy/fake cake halved so it can lay on its side.

Cut 2 greaseproof paper circles, grease the sandwich tins with butter and put the circles inside. Grease the circles.  Place the butter in a large mixing bowl, then add the caster sugar, self-raising flour and baking powder. Crack the eggs one at a time and then add to the bowl. Lastly, add the milk.   Using the electric mixer on slow speed, beat for 2 minutes until smooth. The mixture will be soft enough to drop off the beaters when you lift them up.  Divide the mixture equally between the prepared tins and level the surfaces with a palette knife or spatula. Place in the oven and bake for 20-30 minutes.  The cakes are ready when they are risen and pale golden. The tops should spring back when lightly pressed. Cool for about 2 minutes; loosen the edges with a knife.  Push the cased out of the tins on their bases, invert them and remove the bases. Cool the cakes the right way up on a rack. Soften the jam with a palette knife.  While you wait for the cakes to cool, whip up the cream, sugar, and butter until they make soft peaks. Keep the cream in the fridge.   When the cakes are cold, remove the lining papers and invert one cake layer onto a plate. Spread one cake with jam and the other with half of the cream. Put the second cake on top of the first, add the rest of the cream, add fruit, and sprinkle with icing sugar.  Done!"

Baking,38l5f0,Fogram,7,Thu Jun 4 22:39:43 2015 UTC,"Get a good scale, and work by weight NOT volume. Keep a log of everything you make, along with notes about its taste and texture, and thoughts on how you could improve it if you made it again. Don't make tons of different things, make one thing many times over and really nail the recipe.  Also experiment by varying the amount/type of oil/sugar/milk/egg/etc to develop some intuition for how the various ingredients contribute to the texture and flavor of the final product.  When people you serve your baked good to say it is the best they've ever had, that's when you're ready to move on to the next recipe. Try experimenting with unconventional flours and spices!  A lot of great inspiration is available from baking traditions around the world, particularly India."

Baking,38l5f0,DondeT,2,Fri Jun 5 08:35:45 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree. If OP wants to master the skill then they have to get a feel for things.

If someone raved about a recipe they'd only made once I wouldn't trust them.

A lot of different factors play into your successes, and sometimes it's hard to figure out why things go badly, so don't get discouraged.   I like to find lots of different variations on a recipe and compare them, to get a sense of what works, and why.   I learned a lot from Alton Brown's show Good Eats. His techniques and ideas have proven to be very useful. (I don't always care for his flavor preferences, but the techniques are rock solid.)  As you get some practice, you'll figure out your own preferences. Find some recipes you like A LOT and make them several times. Getting comfortable in the kitchen is a big help. Newbie nervousness can sometimes get in the way of progress.   Even now that I've got some skills/practice, I sometimes pick a technique that's not too familiar and practice. Using different recipes that use the same technique will help you have a better understanding of what you're trying to achieve.   Michael Ruhlman's book Ratio: The Simple Codes Behind the Craft of Everyday Cooking was quite an interesting read."

I'd roll it out like you would normally for sugar cookies, cut it roughly to fit then put it in the tin and trim as necessary.

Baking,38igi5,dakky68,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:22:41 2015 UTC,Nope. Always measure. So 1 cup is 2 american sticks of butter. In Australia our 'sticks' of butter are 250g instead of 113g. So 1 cup is 226grams.  But our cup is 250ml/250g. So I'd be adding more butter than I need.   1 cup of flour is 150g. Etc.  I have to measure eeeeeeeverything.

Baking,38igi5,mapleandvanilla,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:21:02 2015 UTC,"Shit, no, that's not what I meant.  I meant half of measurements like 3/4 cups.  They don't make measuring cups  for that amount, so you might get too much of an ingredient, or too little by measuring with cups.  That's why I suggested weighing things out instead..."
Baking,38igi5,elena_shrugs,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:43:21 2015 UTC,"You can just use tablespoons to manage the difference. One cup is 16 tablespoons by volume. Half a cup is therefore 8 tablespoons, a quarter cup is 4 tablespoons, and an 1/8 cup is two tablespoons.  3/4 cup = 12 tablespoons (0.75*16) So half of 3/4 cup is 6 tablespoons, or 1/4 cup plus two tablespoons (or 1/8 cup, if you have a measuring cup that small)."

Baking,38f0d5,soundkoala,4,Wed Jun 3 19:54:29 2015 UTC,"In my opinion the crumb can be however you want it to be, sourdough is more about the flavour. I'm not a master baker though.

Baking,38f0d5,soundkoala,2,Wed Jun 3 23:20:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input! I think you're right- it's more about the flavor... I can't seem to find anything that says what the ""ideal crumb"" should be.  I've had AMAZING success with Peter Reinart's starter recipe with the pineapple juice method. It completely skips over the stinky period you get in the beginning if you start it with just flour and water: http://pinchmysalt.com/how-to-make-a-sourdough-starter-day-one/  I started mine in the winter, and I think that's why it took so long to really get going. My biggest pointer would be DON'T GIVE UP! There was a time there where I had a little bit of activity, and then none for days and thought, ""forget it."". But I kept with it, and a week later, it was exploding with activity.  Once you get it good and healthy, you can throw it in the fridge an hour after a fresh feeding, and only feed once a week. I just pull mine out of the fridge, let it come to room temp, feed, and put back int he fridge after an hour.  Hope that helped! It really is worth it once you get it going."

Baking,38f0d5,562dreezy,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:55:50 2015 UTC,"I've been wanting to try my hand at baking fresh bread for awhile but haven't looked into it. How do you get the ""ears?"""
Baking,38f0d5,562dreezy,3,Thu Jun 4 03:23:31 2015 UTC,"Its a wonderful hobby!  The ears form when there is enough initial moisture in the oven at the beginning of baking. Most professional ovens can do this easily with no effort, but for most home ovens what you need to do is preheat your oven to a much higher than your recommended temp. (Like 100 degrees more) with a metal pan or some kind of metal pot in lower rack of the oven.   Then, when you put your loaves into the oven, also put 1/2c of water into the pan and close the door right away.  After about 10-15 minutes lower the temperature to the recommended temp. You'll see at this point the ears that have formed.  Bake until ~5 min remain. In the last 5 minutes, crack the door to the oven open with a spoon or something and let the steam evacuate oven until bread is finished baking and crust is crisp!   If you have a grocery store in your area like a co-op or while foods, check to see if they offer any bread making classes! I did a bunch of online research and baked bread for years, but two nights at a class at my local co-op taught me way more than I could ever teach myself through the internet. So many foodie bloggers out there spread misinformation or are wrong about how to properly make bread!   Pro Tip: Always add the salt LAST. It inhibits the growth of yeast. Throw it in with the last bit of flour. Good luck!"

Here's one:  Ingredients  ½ cup butter {room temperature}  1 7 oz. jar Marshmallow Fluff  1 cup powdered sugar  1 tsp. vanilla  Instructions  Beat butter and powdered sugar until fluffy and well mixed.  Mix in fluff and vanilla by hand and mix well.  Add to piping bag and pipe onto cupcakes.  Aaaaaand uno mas:   Ingredients  1¼ cup sugar  ½ cup water  1 egg white- beaten until stiff peaks form  18 large marshmallows  Instructions  Boil sugar and water while stirring frequently until syrup reaches 235 degrees or syrup forms a soft ball in ice water. Remove from heat.  Break the marshmallows in pieces, add to the hot syrup. DO NOT STIR. Let sit 1 -2 minutes. Pour slowly over the stiffly beaten egg whites, beating rapidly.  Continue beating frosting until it reaches desired consistency to spread. If it gets too thick to spread beat in a few drops of water."

Baking,38h111,ikeaspecial,3,Thu Jun 4 03:51:16 2015 UTC,"welcome to the wonderful world of cakes.  beware that even for the best of us, sometimes they just don't turn out.  This being said, the recipe that you used has terrible directions for you.  They assume you know everything already, I guess.  Try this: turn your oven on to 350, line the bottom of your pan or pans with parchment paper and grease the sides, assemble all of your ingredients before you start, sift the flour, baking soda, salt and baking powder together before you add it to the liquid ingredients in the end.  Beat your eggs, milk, oil, cocoa and boiling water mixture together with the sugar and vanilla for at least 5 minutes, then add the dry ingredients(flour, soda, powder and salt), mixing only until just combined (no flour showing).  Immediately put the batter in your pans, level lightly with a spatuala and put it in the oven, checking it 5 minutes before it should be done and leaving it in until the cake begins to separate from the sides and the center is firm, checking with a tooth pick for sticky insides. If it is clean, take the cake out and let it cool on a rack for 10 minutes, then slide a small knife around the edges and invert on a rack to remove it from the pan, let it cool before frosting.  good luck."
Baking,38h111,udistbill,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:15:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I have a couple more questions for mixing batter and handling cake in general. How important is sifting? When I make the batter, I use an electric mixer which uses a whisk handle. I have read from some sources that paddle handles are a must. Is that true? Also, do recommend any chocolate cake recipes? Sorry for my questions, I'm really new to this."
Baking,38h111,udistbill,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:36:06 2015 UTC,"it's quite important to sift the dry ingredients together at least once, sometimes twice in order to get all the ingredients evenly mixed throughout the batter.  Paddle handles are better for mixing batter, the whisk works but gets too much air into it.  There are a zillion chocolate cake recipes, and it's up to you to try each and every one of them, lol.  No, just have fun trying different ones.  The one you tried is called a chiffon style, there are others, butter cakes, angle food cakes, etc.  Google them and look for techniques and recipes.   have fun!"
Baking,38h111,udistbill,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:50:39 2015 UTC,"What type of cake would be a good choice for decoration yet provide a good, soft texture?"
Baking,38h111,gypsy_teacher,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:27:21 2015 UTC,both chiffon and butter cakes are good for decorating.
Baking,38h111,gypsy_teacher,2,Thu Jun 4 06:26:30 2015 UTC,"The cake in the photo - is this the first time that you've had a cake ""go solid,"" or is this happening to every recipe you try? If it's happened more than once, make sure that you're understanding the ingredients and measurements - I've had to school some pretty good cooks on the fact that baking soda and baking powder are not the same thing (and just recently saw someone substitute pectin for gelatin in a sauce...don't ask). Furthermore, sometimes the mixing technique or times can seem nebulous: ""Cream butter and sugar for five minutes on high speed until light and fluffy."" Okay, what speed is ""'high"" on your mixer isn't the same on mine. And maybe I judge ""fluffy"" differently, or decide that ""light"" refers to color and not texture. In cooking, you can often get away with varying ingredients or proportions if you understand some of the chemistry. In baking, it's ALL chemistry and you can. not. do. that. Or you end up with a brick, as you found.  And to be sure, I'm often wary of using YouTube or even blogs for baking recipes. When I'm baking anything truly basic, I'll use a tried-and-true cookbook - maybe not specifically for baking, even, but a book with good instructions that has been vetted year after year by home cooks. I have used cake recipes out of Mark Bittman's How to Cook Everything and The Better Homes and Gardens book. If I want something fancier, I always go for Maida Heatter's books (in my view, she is the gold standard in dessert cookbooks)."
Baking,38h111,gypsy_teacher,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:45:58 2015 UTC,"It happens all the time sadly and it's really depressing.   Edit: Oops,  let me continue: I've also read that it may be due to oven placement and overall kitchen temperature. I live in Southern California, so it's relatively warm around here and AC is expensive. Brand of ingredients may be a factor too, but I think that's a tad bit of a stretch. Most of my supplies come from Walmart"
Baking,38h111,LurkAddict,2,Thu Jun 4 05:20:52 2015 UTC,"Have your oven checked by a professional, but I don't think that's it: if your oven is having a problem, the cake will either burn or take twice as long - this looks to me like a problem with ingredients or technique. Replace your baking soda and baking powder (powder should be replaced every six months) and keep them in airtight, dry conditions."
Baking,38h111,ollieballs,2,Thu Jun 4 05:24:42 2015 UTC,"Also, if the recipe says to sift, do it. You don't need a sifter...I use an Oxo Good Grips mesh strainer to sift everything and it's fine."
Baking,38h111,harper64,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:27:56 2015 UTC,"Mesh Strainers > Sifters.  Waaaay easier to use, just be sure to be sifting into a large bowl or your ingredients will be all over your countertops"
Baking,38h111,lryuzakilawliet,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:29:46 2015 UTC,"I've used this recipe several times, and it's pretty similar to the recipe you used but has much better instructions including pictures of each step. I hope this helps!   I've never had a problem like the one you're having but I agree with what someone else said, that it's more likely a problem with your ingredients than with your oven. Also, I wonder if you could be over-mixing your batter? I always stir with just a spoon because I feel like I can get a better sense of when a batter is ""stirred just to combined"" with that, rather than using a electric mixer. This gives a breakdown of what happens when you over-mix, it's not exactly like your cake but it could be part of the problem. Sifting is somewhat related to this issue too, because if you sift the dry ingredients, you're making sure there are no lumps and everything is evenly distributed, so you don't need to stir the final batter nearly as much.  Good luck :)"

Baking,38c1eh,AzbyKat,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:04:49 2015 UTC,"First thing's first; cooking times are a general guideline only. Slide a knife in at the ~30 min mark. If it doesn't come out clean, drop the temp and add 10 mins.  If you do that, and the knife seems clean but the dough feels undercooked when you bite into it... it's possibly due to overkneading/fermenting; I find if I knead too much or, more commonly, leave my bread to rise for much more than 24 hrs (at which fermentation slows, and it starts to deflate), I end up with a chewy, dense, doughy layer in the middle of the loaf, that's kind of similar to the texture of partly cooked dough."
Baking,38c1eh,Artith,2,Wed Jun 3 15:27:43 2015 UTC,Thank you! I will do this!
Baking,38c1eh,B3N10,2,Wed Jun 3 18:19:06 2015 UTC,"Some things for me that i feel may have helped.   Punching the dough after about 2 hours of rising, then kneeding it for a couple minutes before letting it rise some more for another 2 hours. Put a tray at the bottom of the oven and splashed some water and ice onto it right after i put the bread in. Supposedly steam helps with the initial rising during first few minutes of cooking Varying cooking tempts. For my loaf. I started at 450 for about 20 to 25 minutes, then lowered to 400 for about 5 and turned off, but kept in the oven for 5.   I'm sure these things didn't make or break it, but they didn't seem to hurt it."

Baking,387etk,michcake,3,Thu Jun 4 03:50:07 2015 UTC,"I suppose any light, yellow cake recipe would work, but here's the one I've used:   2 large egg whites, room temperature 2 large egg yolks, room temperature 2 1/4 cups of flour 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup of unsalted butter, room temperature 1 3/4 cups granulated sugar 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 teaspoon coffee extract, optional 1 cup whole milk, room temperature    Beat the egg whites until soft peaks form.  Combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix the egg yolks, milk, and extracts together.  Cream butter and sugar together.  Add a third of the flour mixture and half of the egg mixture to the creamed sugar and butter. Add another third of the flour mixture, and the second half of the egg mixture. Add the last bit of flour. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter.  Bake the cupcakes for about 15-20 minutes, or until fully cooked, at 350 degrees.    Espresso Syrup:  On a stovetop, disolve 1/4 of a cup of sugar in 1 ounce of marsala wine and 1/3 cup of strong espresso.   Once the cupcakes and the syrup have cooled, you're going to brush the tops of them with the syrup. Keep brushing them with the syrup again, and again until you've used it all. I like to core a small whole in the center of the cupcakes, so the syrup seeps further in, but that's not necessary. Let the syrup seep into the cupcakes for 30 minutes.   Mascarpone Frosting: I like to put my mixing bowl and whisk attachment in the freezer before making a mascarpone frosting. It always comes out smoother when I do.  Whisk 1 cup of heavy cream and 1/2 cup of powdered sugar until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into 8 ounces of mascarpone frosting.   Frost the cupcakes and dust with coco powder just before serving."

Local farmers markets, boutique / gourmet food stores are great places to find that something special.  Edit: also, if she doesn't already have it, the Baker's Companion by King Arthur Flour and The Joy of Baking are great cookbooks to get a hang of the classics.

Baking,382oco,some1american,2,Mon Jun 1 21:47:20 2015 UTC,"I used this for the pastry: http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/8079/basic-sweet-pastry  And for the filling, dice a whole large cooking / bramley apple as finely as you can, and sautee in about 50-75g of butter. When it starts to soften, add golden syrup (3-4 spoonfuls), golden caster sugar (roughly 100g), vanilla, cinnamon and other mulling spices. You may need to stand over it and sturdy as much as you can to prevent the caramel from burning, and adjust ingredients as you go along (I'm afraid I'm a bit of an experimenter, my recipes change get a lot). When it's a lively golden brown colour and somewhat sticky, but NOT burnt, take off the heat and cool. Pour into cooled pastry cases and top with thinly sliced apple (any will do). I tossed my apple slices in some melted butter, sugar and spices before placing them on top of the Apple mixture and sprinkled more brown sugar half way through baking to make them crisp up and caramelise. Take them out about 2 minutes after the mixture starts bubbling in the pastry case.   For the custard, any classic recipe, even instant will do, just add a dash of vanilla extract (i used half a vanilla bean stalk)  and a tea spoon of cinnamon. I made about a pint of it.   Best served warm.   Also, the custard you see is decorative, I pretty much bathed my tart in custard after I took the picture ;)"

Since you're already using the lowest heat setting, maybe roll out your cakes a touch thinner. The cracking is a function of the steam being generated inside the cake, so it's not because you lack moisture. That said, I'm not too sure how you would avoid it in this recipe."

Baking,385yeb,casagordita,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:15:03 2015 UTC,"My baked crust does get softer and less crispy when it sits a day or two.  You can make the dough, roll out the bottom crust and put it in the pie plate, and chill it until you're ready to bake it.  Fill it, roll out the bottom crust and put it in place, and bake it the day you plan to serve it.  That's actually a good thing to do--chilling and resting can help prevent the crust from shrinking as it bakes, and give you a more tender crust.  Here's my cherry pie recipe, adapted from Cooks Illustrated.  If you're using sweet cherries instead of sour, cut the sugar down to about 3/4 cup.  Cherry Pie  6 cups sour pie cherries (pitted), or 6 cups pitted frozen pie cherries  1 small lemon, zested to yield 1 teaspoon zest and juiced to yield 2 teaspoons juice  1/8 teaspoon almond extract   1 Tablespoon brandy   1-1/4 cup granulated sugar (1-3/4 cups if using fresh cherries)  3–4 Tablespoons quick-cooking tapioca  pastry for double-crust pie  Roll bottom crust about 1/8-inch thick. Transfer and fit dough into deep-dish Pyrex pie pan, leaving dough that overhangs the lip in place. Chill or freeze until ready to fill.  Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees.  Move the oven rack to the lowest position.  Toss fruit with lemon juice and zest, almond extract, brandy, sugar, and tapioca; let stand for 15 minutes.  Turn fruit mixture, including juices, into pie shell.  Refrigerate until ready to top with remaining dough.  Roll top crust on lightly floured surface. Lay over fruit. Trim top and bottom dough edges to 1/2-inch beyond pan lip. Tuck this rim of dough underneath itself so that folded edge is flush with pan lip. Flute dough in your own fashion, or press with fork tines to seal. Cut four slits at right angles on dough top to allow steam to escape.  Place in freezer for 10 minutes before baking.  Bake on the lowest oven rack for 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees and move pie down, directly onto baking stone (this helps get the bottom crust nice and crisp).  Continue to bake until juices bubble and crust is golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes longer.  Transfer pie to wire rack; let cool to almost room temperature so juices have time to thicken, from 1 to 2 hours."

Baking,3863mc,coriacea,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:39:50 2015 UTC,"I really try not to make something that will make the diabetic feel singled out.  Instead I'll make something that doesn't necessarily scream DIABETIC DESSERT!  Depending on the diabetic, assuming they can have fruit, you could make a dessert layered with lots of fruit and lightly sweetened cream.  You could use layers of sugar free pudding in there too, it's sugar free flavor will be hidden by all the other things going on.  A lot of grocery store bakeries will have soft, unfilled lady fingers, these are almost like puffs of air and contain very little sugar, great for a layered dessert.  A trifle like this won't scream DIABETIC and could be enjoyed by all.    This approach means that you won't have a bad version of a traditional dessert because of all of the substitutions.   I'll let the person know how I made it so they can judge how much to have and not tell anyone else unless they ask."
Baking,3863mc,pastryfiend,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:49:30 2015 UTC,"Never fear, making healthy desserts is my specialty.  The key is to start with the right ingredients.  You can make a flour that can be substituted 1:1 in most recipes using a mixture of almond meal, coconut flour, vital wheat gluten and hi-maize.    Coconut flour is reasonably priced and incredibly nutritious and delicious, but it absorbs a lot of water, swelling up in the process.  This leads to fluffy, overly moist baked goods if too much is used.  Additionally, coconut flour doesn't form a gel, so it needs to be paired with a gel forming starch.  I wouldn't go higher than about 30% coconut flour in your flour mixture by weight.  Almond flour is also incredibly nutritious and delicious, but unfortunately it is very expensive.  Almond flour absorbs very little moisture, thus it pairs really well with coconut flour - I recommend around a 1:1 ratio of almond flour to coconut flour by weight.  Like coconut flour, almond flour also does not form a gel, and needs to be paired with a gel forming flour for optimal results.  Again, about 30% by weight is the upper limit on the amount of almond flour I would use.  Vital wheat gluten is used to provide binding to the flour mixture.  This is particularly important for flour mixtures that are heavily comprised of non-starchy ingredients.  If your flour mixture is about 12.5% vital wheat gluten by weight that give it about the same gluten content as all purpose flour.  Finally, the hi-maize is about 60% fiber by weight, and the type of fiber it contains has been shown to improve glucose tolerance, however it has a slightly ""off"" taste and is somewhat expensive.  Adding some hi-maize to the coconut/almond/vital gluten mixture will cause it to gel better, so it behaves more like a regular flour in recipes.  In mild-flavored baked goods, I generally don't notice the taste of hi-maize when used at about 10% of the flour mixture, by weight.  If you are making something with a stronger flavor (heavily spiced, or chocolate) you can probably go up to about 30-35% hi-maize by weight before it becomes noticeable.   In terms of sweeteners, there are really only two acceptable options - erythritol and sucralose.  Erythritol has a better taste, and due to its poor moisture binding properties it actually pairs extremely well with coconut flour.  Sucralose is much cheaper, and can be tolerated in larger quantities.  A combination of the two works best.  If you are using almond flour and coconut flour, you can reduce the added fat/oil in most baked goods significantly (except brownies).  In terms of health, nut and seed oils are best, and they produce great results in pretty much everything except recipes where you need to cream the butter and sugar.  Sweet almond oil has a very neutral flavor that works for everything, and pecan oil goes well with things containing cocoa or molasses.  Hope that helps!"

Overall it's at 20% is alcohol and 6 oz and that's also the recipe  for the cocktail. I will say it did have a boozey  bite though.   Also I don't think the flavor was hidden  by the gin or vermouth (the vermouth itself should be fruity and tart anyways).   I'm thinking maybe some orange liquor  and lemon juice or something,  but don't know where to add these.  I guess the filling could take some orange liquor,  but I don't know what could handle lemon juice."

Baking,37yjyz,Echilon,15,Sun May 31 14:13:49 2015 UTC,That is no prinsesstårta. That is a prinsessbakelse. There's a difference. Tårtor are made for a larger company while a bakelse is made for one or maximum of 2 people.

Ett motsvarande bakverk som är mindre, så att det endast utgör en portion, kallas normaltbakelse. ""  Translated:  ""The torte is made to be shared with many persons and being cut up in smaller pieces. A pastry like the torte that is smaller so that it is only one portion is normally called a 'bakelse'(tart)""  So what you've made are small prinsesstårtor which are called prinsessbakelser just because they are made in to portions.

Baking,380iw7,freakoutinout,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:13:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely, will even make it better!  This will be especially good since the flour will have time to absorb the liquid and the fats will solidify so that when it bakes the starch will caramelize before the fat melt.  This is why we chill cookie dough, same theory.  The baking soda/powder will not react until heat is applied since it is mixed into the dry ingredients.  So go for it!"

Also the sticky bun recipe there is out of this world.  http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/joanne-changs-sticky-buns-recipe.html  So I make the brioche. Roll it out into a rectangle and spread some pastry cream on it. Then sprinkle it with raisins I have soaked overnight in rum. Roll up jelly roll style and slice. Proof. Bake. Then I use the rum I had the raisins soaking in to make the glaze. I just add icing sugar until it is a spreadable/brushable consistency.

Baking,37voj9,Triette,206,Sun May 31 00:29:31 2015 UTC,"""This morning when I woke up, I decided today to walk around naked.  Ever since I came out of my mother's womb I have been a lover of being naked, and seeing as it was a bit misty and warm outside I decided that today would be the day to relive my most cherished childhood memory.  As I lay there in my wonderfully soft 300 count Ralph Lauren cotton sheets that I purchased on a whim one month in July after a terrible interaction with a Barista at my local coffee shop, the kind frequented by the hip and trendy, I decided to collect my tired bones and walk out into the living room.  On most days I wake up, I merely put on a robe before entering my living room that carries sweet memories of friends and many a wine party nights.  But today I decided that I was going to go against the norm, throw caution into the wind and just go straight into the living room, passing this adorable big eyed puppy painting I bought last week while on a ""I should go to the flea market"" binge.  So there I stood naked, a cool slight breeze on my body.  As I glanced at my great grandmother's clock that she brought over with her from a summer trip to Paris with her sisters back in 1922, I see that the black art deco styled hands are pointing at the 4.  Now that the haze is starting to clear from my just woken mind, I realize that it's 4pm, and I had just awoke from a nap after being so exhausted from my earlier amazement at how simple and easy my new scone recipe is!  My in-laws simply loved them, and at the suggestion of my loving husband I took a nap.  My dear husband must have suggested his family to stay as they are still sitting in the living room, looking with their loving gaze towards me.  They must think I am so zany!  I love Ambien!! <3"""

Also a favorite: Apple roses.  Most Apple rose cupcakes or tartes are either almost raw or burned.

Baking,37voj9,_Kahlo,10,Sun May 31 04:28:51 2015 UTC,"I really love to bake and try new things but I'm very much a recipe follower, which I'm fine with, but I have looked at so many blogs, which are very popular, it seems.  I have always found the walls of text really odd.. and how they talk about unnecessary things.  The thing that really bothered me was that (I'm not saying they're all like this, but the majority of them/the most popular ones were American) they all have such insane amounts of frosting, sweetness, sticky coatings and the like, it's just too much for me. Is it an American thing, mainly?   Also the using cups to measure everything and having to convert all the measurements is awkward, why are some solids measured in cups, isnt that just for liquids? It's so confusing for me.. but that's another thing :)"
Baking,37voj9,YourWaterloo,4,Sun May 31 00:47:23 2015 UTC,"Yep. Cups. Always cups. I have a number of friends who bake and I'm the only one that owns a scale. I rarely use it too. And in comparison to most culture we eat a ton of sweets! And we like them decadent! Honestly though I don't think our sweets are really the root of Americas obesity problem, most bakers and their families eat in moderation, I think it's more of over eating and terrible quality food. I think bloggers just tend to focus on what excites and interests people. Cake and brownies is way more fun to look at than salad and main dishes."
Baking,37voj9,Antisera,3,Sun May 31 02:29:32 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I'm not here to say that's why so many people are obese! haha, I do agree with you though.

Baking,37voj9,Tulabean,21,Sun May 31 00:17:04 2015 UTC,"Also, spices can vary a lot in potency depending on where you buy and how you store. If someone buys supermarket spices and keeps them for years, I wouldn't be surprised if they could use 2-3x as much as someone with fresh Penzey's spices... and still get less flavor and aroma.  Obviously, I'd like a fairly professional food blogger to (a) know not to use shitty spices and (b) be aware of that problem and account for it."

Baking,37voj9,B-D-E-D,27,Sun May 31 04:23:15 2015 UTC,"Wow. I'm sitting here reading all these comments and I'm like...I should start a cooking blog. I don't usually get recipes from these blogs because I went to culinary school and I'm a pastry chef so when I'm not using recipes from textbooks or cookbooks, I write a lot of my own recipes.  When I do find something that piques my interest on Pinterest or something like that, I take the basic gist of it and make tweaks. A lot of these recipes sound really dumbed down and not user-friendly at all!  Food network has some good and some bad recipes, but I usually have success when I use them. I really like epicurious, but some of the recipes are really advanced and call for crazy expensive and hard to find ingredients.  But seriously, now I'm thinking of starting a food blog..."
Baking,37voj9,Skarvha,7,Sun May 31 04:57:14 2015 UTC,I would read the hell out of a blog written by a professional.  I've made so many things that look beautiful but taste pretty average due to my obsession with food blogs.
Baking,37voj9,vivian_lake,3,Sat May 30 23:11:16 2015 UTC,"Seconding you on Epicurious.  Pretty much every time a friend makes something amazing, and I ask about the recipe, it's from Epicurious.     Their ""fork ratings"" and comments tend to be from people who've actually made the recipe too.  They don't try to convince you that every single recipe ever is four out of four stars.    My favorite homemade dessert is their Pecan Pie, that little bit of orange zest makes it really fresh.   If you do start a blog, would you share it with us on r/baking?  I would love to read it.    Maybe include a Pinterest Redeemed series, like, ""Found this idea on Pinterest... here's how you actually do it.""  I also really like the idea of including substitution options for expensive or hard to find ingredients.      A marketing consultant once told me that if you are thinking about starting a blog, it helps to plan out the first 12 posts.  If you can come up with 12 good posts off the top of your head, there's probably a pretty good blog in there."
Baking,37voj9,kelzispro,11,Sun May 31 04:34:49 2015 UTC,"I would totally support you in that endeavor! I saw a comment on this sub a week or so ago about someone saying as a professional baker/chef they just dont have the time to make a new recipe or new blog post on the time line that pro bloggers do. Which really makes sense, but that's super unfortunate."
Baking,37voj9,vivian_lake,7,Sun May 31 20:44:45 2015 UTC,"OH it's true, just finding time in my day to day work schedule to throw an experimental product in is nearly impossible.

Baking,37voj9,hannita,6,Sun May 31 00:11:42 2015 UTC,"So true. I'm a professional baker and I sell cakes on the side. I've considered starting a blog (mainly to showcase my cakes), but baking, decorating, staging and taking photos, writing posts, editing, etc...all on top of a 50 hour work week? Yeah, right.   I find that most successful bloggers (of any kind, fashion, food, anything) don't have jobs outside the home. Those people also tend to have somewhat boring lives. If you want an interesting blog, you've got to have other stuff going on outside of that. But if you want a successful blog, you've got to dedicate a large portion of your time to it."

No bake needs gelatin (it might just be me really not liking using gelatin) and a day and a bit to set.  I'm not saying baked are bad, but in the UK and every other country I've been to no bake cheesecake is the standard and although I can't find an answer I would guess that it predates baked by a considerable amount.

Using your hands, cut the butter into the dry ingredients (smoosh it all together until the mixture looks like coarse sand). Add the cold buttermilk and mix it around 5 or 6 times. Finally mix in the small cubes of gouda and sausage bits. There should be some flour clumps left in the dough & it will be sticky. Dump it all onto a lightly floured surface and pat out the dough gently to about 1/2 to 3/4 inch. Punch out your biscuits with a floured cutter, and place on a cookie sheet with a little baking spray on it. Bake until golden brown and brush with melted butter while hot.   edit 2 - changed degrees from C to F. Thanks for catching that!"

Baking,37vmv2,tgoddess,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:21:41 2015 UTC,"I bake mine a LOT lower (around 280 or 290F) for about 16-19 minutes (this has more to do with knowing your own oven than anything else, though).  A ""good"" macaron won't have an air pocket.  Sounds like it could either be the too hot oven, which would make them puff too fast, or you didn't beat enough of the air of the meringue while making your macaronage."
Baking,37vmv2,mr_richichi,3,Tue Jun 2 23:56:37 2015 UTC,"Ya this is straight up horse shit. Don't ""knock all the air bubbles out"" either, thats the whole point of folding in the almond... to keep the air in there. If mixed properly you shouldn't have to knock air out. If you over whip then ya sure knock some out. But don't beat the shit out of it until it is soup.  Also, don't EVER pipe macarons or anything for that matter the way that she did. For somebody giving instructionals she desperately needs to be slapped in the face with a soggy baguette for that shit."

Baking,37vmv2,Fromagenut,1 point,Sat May 30 23:23:36 2015 UTC,"The ones that came out of the oven were a different batch. Whip your meringue until just under stiff peaks, then gently fold the powdered sugar and almond flour in. Once the mixture is fully incorporated you macronage ( the reason its called a macaron).  Macronage is when you knock down some of the air out of the meringue, the key is to knock enough air out so the batter doesnt pile up on itself and not so much that its runny.   When you pipe, make a stencil on parchment paper of circles then place another sheet of parchement paper directly on top of that. Use a round piping tip, i use #805. Dont pipe at an angle you want to have it strait up and down and pipe the batter so it fills 80% of the circle. Pipe the whole tray then, remove your stencil. Now take your tray and tap it to knock any air bubbles out 3-6 times. At this point you will know if the batter was correct because it should be smooth topped and the same size as that stencil.  Dont bake them yet though! Wait until the top is dry, and bake only one tray at a time. This is the key to getting ""feet""  Also dont be discouraged it took me 4 years on my own practing on and off to perfect these lil buggers."

Sometimes its easier to manipulate if you warm it up for a couple seconds in the microwave (10 seconds) if you do it too long it'll melt.  Also once you've dirty iced your cake i put min in the freezer to help set the frosting before applying the fondant.

Google ""homemade marshmallow fondant."" Tastes 100x better than the store bought stuff, and you can make custom colors.  Can't help you with this one, but I think piped grass would look just as nice! You can totally freeze buttercream frosting. If you do go the fondant route, don't freeze or refrigerate though.   As a final word of advice: don't stress! It's a fun cake and no one is going to mind if the grass doesn't look 100% realistic or if the frosting isn't totally smooth. Have fun with it!"
Baking,37u46x,imbakingacake,1 point,Sat May 30 16:17:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice- I'll think about trying marshmallow fondant. Most recipes seem to call for a 1:2 ratio by mass of marshmallows to powdered sugar. Do you think I could get away with using less sugar so it'll be less sweet?
Baking,37u46x,imbakingacake,1 point,Sat May 30 17:09:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly, probably not. The sugar isn't just for taste- it's what holds the fondant together and keeps it from getting sticky. And if you're adding food coloring, you're going to need even more powdered sugar to keep the texture right. It's not overly sweet though... At least not in my opinion."

Baking,37u46x,tgoddess,3,Sun May 31 08:11:19 2015 UTC,"My .02...  Since a tennis ball isn't perfectly smooth (it's sorta fuzzy), it doesn't seem like you'd NEED to go for that look.  And with patience (and some practice) you can get buttercream VERY smooth-looking.    Not sure what flavor you were going for, but you could buttercream coat it and then cover it in finely dessicated coconut (to give it the fuzzy effect).  You could even tint it, if you wanted your tennis ball to be a particular color.  You can also very easily freeze a buttercream-iced cake (probably wouldn't want to have it frozen for more than a day unless it's tightly wrapped/covered, though).  You could also try something like this for the grass:  http://www.amazon.com/Edible-Green-Apple-Candy-Easter/dp/B007MM64XQ"

Guess I'll need to do a trial run to see what effect that gives.  Also, great to hear that buttercream can be frozen. Thanks for the advice!"

In a separate bowl, blend the bourbon and agave nectar. Stir this bourbon mixture into the dry mixture; blend well. Cover and chill for a few hours - until firm enough to roll into balls - it will be sticky. Shape dough into balls and roll them in the confectioners' sugar. Store in refrigerator in tightly covered containers. Make these a few days in advance for best flavor, and roll in confectioners' sugar again before serving, if desired. These can also be frozen for longer storage.   (edit to make bullet points work)"

Baking,37r9rh,superdankmaymays,1 point,Fri May 29 19:27:31 2015 UTC,I didn't. I used cornstarch as it's thickener and not gelatine (how it's done the modern way). Many recipes for Turkish Delight calls for cornstarch instead of gelatine.

Baking,37lru5,LetsDips,8,Thu May 28 15:32:38 2015 UTC,"Recipe: 1 cup almond flour 1 cup powdered sugar 2 egg whites  1/2 cup granulated sugar  1/4 tsp cream of tartar 1/4 tsp green gel food colouring 1/8 tsp peppermint extract   Sift together almond flour and powdered sugar until homogenous  Beat egg whites until frothy, add cream of tartar, slowly add granulated sugar 1tsp at a time. In a large mixing bowl combine the egg whites (now stiff peaks) with the peppermint oil and gel food colouring by gently folding in with a spatula, after 4-5 folds begin by adding flour mixture.  Fold and the mixture until there aren't any lumps, but be careful of over mixing. The ideal number of spatula folds is approximately 50-55. Transfer batter into a piping bag with a large round tip on the end and pipe 1-1.5 inch rounds onto a baking sheet. Let the macarons dry for 30-60 mins so that a shell forms and to develop feet. The end result should be that the macarons surface is not sticky to a light touch. Bake at 275 F for 20 mins, let cool, and then fill with your choice of spread. For this recipe I made a semi sweet chocolate ganache.   Chocolate ganache:  1/2 cup heavy cream  3/4 cup semi sweet chocolate chips    Heat cream to a simmer, not boil, and pour over chocolate  Mix until combined and smooth, avoid making bubbles Refrigerate until cool, but still spreadable, about 30 mins    VOILA! super delicious and great crowd pleasers :)"

Baking,37njbh,Caitybeck,3,Thu May 28 23:07:19 2015 UTC,"Those look really nice, but just to add my 2 cents in...  The Macaron is meant to take a crispy meringue cookie and a wet filling and over the period of time, the two layers meld together making a crispy chewy cookie sandwich.   I'm afraid if you make a pate de fruits, there won't be enough moisture in the filling to make a good macaron.   I think what the blogger might have done is made a ring of buttercream and put the jelly in the center.  If you make a true pate de fruits, I would personally make it a lot smaller so that your cookie has the right texture.  Hope that helps! (Also, again.. this is just my 2 cents... you don't have to follow it :) )"

Baking,37lklw,dadwhats4dinner1,3,Thu May 28 14:42:52 2015 UTC,"Now you've made me want to make lamingtons this weekend. This is happening.   Couple of things though about that recipe - I don't know where the cornflour thing came from, but no.  Lamingtons were basically a way to freshen up stale cake so you can make any kind of buttercake you like - This is a recipe that works well - The texture of that cake looks all wrong and a really light, delicate cake won't survive dipping in the chocolate sauce.   Also I'd skip the whole nutella buttercream, at least until after you've tried them the traditional way.  The chocolate sauce that soaks in is really sweet and at most you should fill them with a bit of jam and whipped cream.    Final tip - to dip them, balance them on a fork and lower them into the chocolate. Then pop an upside down fork on the top so it's cradled between them, and flip to soak the other side."

Baking,37n5gr,SugarBearsWoman,1 point,Fri May 29 01:30:55 2015 UTC,"Have to second this, definitely buy a stand mixer, I bought myself a kitchen aid artisan about a year ago and I have never looked back since. Its extremely helpful for kneading bread, whipping cream, creaming sugar and butter for cookies, making perfect fluffy buttercream and so, so, soooooo much more. Not to mention you can get all sorts of really cool attachments for the kitchen aid. I have to say it was one of my best investments. A hand mixer is okay but think of the tired arms. Plus If I really want to whip something I can let my kitchen aid just go and start cleaning and what not."
Baking,37n5gr,nickiday,3,Fri May 29 05:28:23 2015 UTC,"I will use my handheld when I only need to beat/whip a small amount of something...like a single egg while; my KitchenAid wouldn't even be able to do that effectively, given the shape of the bowl and where the whisk hits."
Baking,37n5gr,tgoddess,1 point,Thu May 28 23:29:05 2015 UTC,Not true.  I've made whipped cream with like 1/4 cup of heavy cream before with my Kitchenaid.  The whisk should come very close to the bottom of the bowl.
Baking,37n5gr,Outlulz,2,Fri May 29 03:34:51 2015 UTC,"Depends on the size,  the 6qt mixer isn't going to whip anything over 2 cups"

Baking,37n5gr,tgoddess,2,Fri May 29 11:23:52 2015 UTC,"I don't even own a stand mixer, although I've used one belonging to someone else. The two things that keep me from buying one are 1) the price and 2) it seems like a pain in the butt.   To be more specific regarding #2, every time I watch a video of someone using a stand mixer they constantly have to stop it a couple times to scrape the bowl since it doesn't do a good job of getting the sides and bottom of whatever is being mixed. Then of course you have yet another dirty bowl.   That is not to say I don't WANT a stand mixer---I do. One day I'll have one. But I think it will take a lot for me to take the plunge and actually buy one. You should see the hand mixer I use...it was given to me by my grandmother and looks to be from the 70s or 80s. But it has 5 speed settings, and I'm able to maneuver around the bowl effortlessly. I think that if I ever do wind up with a stand mixer I'll probably just wind up whipping out the hand mixer anyway. I'm lazy :P"
Baking,37n5gr,adelltfm,2,Fri May 29 03:29:48 2015 UTC,every time I watch a video of someone using a stand mixer they constantly have to stop it a couple times to scrape the bowl since it doesn't do a good job of getting the sides and bottom of whatever is being mixed.   There are beaters with a scraper built in that cost about $20.
Baking,37n5gr,Outlulz,0,Fri May 29 03:35:38 2015 UTC,"My main use is kneading,  other than that...   If you make bread a lot, worth it.    Or you want to make a half gallon of frosting /mashed potatoes"
Baking,37n5gr,Purple-mastadon,1 point,Fri May 29 03:41:46 2015 UTC,"It's mainly a choice between:  do you need something now that won't last,  or something that you can/will use often for a long time.  Your baking needs are the deciding factor.     The stand mixer let's you get used to it, while performing like a champ whenever you need it, does everything the hand mixer can do, just clean it. But it's heavy and big.   The hand mixer (not immersion blender, mixer) brand new works great at beating the crap out of light mixes (box cake, merengue, whipped cream, etc.)   cannot handle kneading or torque in any way. Usually fits into a drawer but prolonged use kills it."
Baking,37n5gr,Purple-mastadon,1 point,Fri May 29 03:50:43 2015 UTC,"One bid upside of the Kitchenaid, is it allows me to do other stuff while the machine is working (ie, whipping egg whites, while I'm trying to cook/watch sugar syrup on the stove)."

Baking,37mo8t,arkahd,3,Thu May 28 19:19:54 2015 UTC,"The dry ingredients can be stored mixed together indefinitely. This is essentially what a boxed cake mix is. Nothing starts reacting until liquid is added.  I think I would agree with you about the wet ingredients. Letting the eggs sit overnight with the acidic lemon juice and buttermilk might cause some unpleasant reactions.   If you're going to really be in a hurry in the morning, you could portion the wet ingredients out into individual bowls and stick them in the fridge overnight. That way you can just mix everything together quickly."
Baking,37mo8t,bernath,1 point,Thu May 28 19:46:14 2015 UTC,"Brilliant, your method for the wet ingredients is definitely what I was thinking.  My only remaining concern is with the lemon zest on the dry ingredients, would this create a reaction with the dry ingredients?   Truthfully I'm happy to just zest it in the morning anyways, flavor might be brighter if I do it fresh."
Baking,37mo8t,bernath,2,Thu May 28 19:54:06 2015 UTC,I would save the lemon zesting for the morning as well. Probably not enough moisture to cause any reaction but you might have some clumps form overnight.

I agree with the flavour in the middle rule, with two exceptions - adding a little cinnamon or cardamom to the dry mix seems to cause no issues, and replacing about 2 tbsp on the powdered sugar with good quality dutch process cocoa powder makes a beautiful chocolate macaron. I would leave the almond flour ratio and everything else the same."

Baking,37hq42,Beepolai,8,Wed May 27 20:51:13 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm going to give you something very very dear to me.  My buttercream icing recipe.  I get tons of compliments on it, and it's very light and manages not to be too crazy sweet.  Here you go!  2 sticks (8 oz) salted butter  2 2/3 sticks margarine  1/3 cup shortening (I prefer high-ratio shortening if you can get it, but Crisco works fine)  2 pounds powdered sugar  1 Tablespoon pure vanilla extracy  1/4 teaspoon salt  In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, whip the fats together until creamy, about 2-3 minutes, scrape bowl.  Add sugar, vanilla, and salt, and whip on medium-high speed for at least 6 minutes, or until the icing begins to ""climb"" the sides of the bowl (scrape bowl 2-3 times during this period).  This stuff is incredible, it spreads beautifully and pipes like a dream.  You can add a tablespoon of meringue powder to it for a little added stability if you want to make roses or use it on an outdoor wedding cake in summer.  If you're sick of icing that's too rich, dense, or sweet, this will be your new best friend.  Enjoy!  Edit: formatting"

Baking,37lued,Lifeisgood0109,1 point,Fri May 29 03:35:22 2015 UTC,"I would recommend a springform pan. It's round, you can layer everything and refrigerate it to let it set (I would do overnight to be safe) then all you have to do is take the ring off and serve it. I would say line the bottom to remove it from  the pan so it can be transferred to a plate or serving dish of your choosing."

Baking,37lued,tgoddess,1 point,Thu May 28 17:37:37 2015 UTC,"If you have access to a ring/acetate, I'd go this route.  The only issue I see is if you have to leave it out anyplace that's warm/ish for a while.  Tiramisu doesn't have much to hold it up, so to speak and it could start collapsing/squishing.    What about a trifle dish?  Then you could see it all and not worry about it turning into a mess on a plate."

Baking,37i24h,CleverLittleLady,4,Fri May 29 16:15:56 2015 UTC,I used to use parchment for my mousse cakes and had similar issues and then switched over to acetate strips.

Baking,37c6cx,raptorfromspace,9,Tue May 26 15:31:41 2015 UTC,"This was my first time trying to tackle the cake, which is hands down the most popular cake in Sweden. I'm happy with how it came out as a first attempt, but I think my sponge cake needs work--if anyone can throw me some suggestions I'd be really thankful!   I didnt realize the pictures were so bad until it was too late and the cake was gone :(  For the cake:   1 cup flour  1 1/4 cup sugar  4 eggs  Beat the eggs and sugar until fluffy/pale, then fold in flour and immediately bake at 375F for 15-20 minutes.    For the custard:  1 1/2 cup heavy cream 4 egg whites 3 tblsp corn starch 2 tblsp sugar 2 tsp vanilla extract  Place everything but vanilla in a small saucepan and whisk on low heat until the mixture thickens. Then add vanilla and place in fridge.   For the whipped cream:  2 cups heavy cream 4 tblsp sugar  Whip until fluffy and peaks form   For the marzipan:  1 1/2 cup almond flour 1 1/2 cup powedered sugar 2 tsp almond extract 1 egg white  place almond flour and powdered sugar in food processor and blend until smooth. Then add almond extract and blend. Add egg white and blend. Add powdered sugar as needed until dough is not sticky to the touch.  Refrigerate.    For the preserves:  I used a jar of store-bought raspberry preserves.   Assembly:   Once the cake has cooled, slice into 3 layers. (I ended up having to make 2 cakes because I couldn't slice them well enough). Place bottom layer down first, then add a good amount of the preserves, being sure to spread it in the middle and leaving some space between the preserves and the edge of the cake (as it will spread out on its own with the extra weight on top of it) Add a generous layer of custard, again, leaving a gap between the edge of the cake and the custard. Add the next layer of cake, and more custard. Once the custard is down, slowly build a large pile of whipped cream, tapering down the sides to form a dome of sorts.  Gently place the final layer of cake on top of the whipped cream dome, and carefully push the edged into the whipped cream to make a smooth seam. Then cover the whole cake (tope and sides) in whipped cream. This will be what the marzipan sticks to. Color the marzipan if you plan to do so (mine should have been lime green, but we only had red food coloring). Roll the marzipan out using powdered sugar instead of flour to keep from sticking. Then roll the marzipan onto the rolling pin for an easier time laying it over the cake. Slowly smooth the marzipan over the cake, with the end goal being a smooth sheet of marzipan all over. Trim the excess marzipan from the edges and make roses to put on the cake if you are so inclined.    The cake must be refrigerated before serving"

Baking,37cadj,YourToothbrush,4,Tue May 26 16:00:03 2015 UTC,"Recipe from Sally's Baking Addiction  Tips (from both Sally and myself):   Stir the nutella thoroughly before adding on both occasions. Nutella is a lot like peanut butter and can separate. This can lead to a weird consistency when you're mixing, so stir vigorously before adding until the nutella is smooth and falls easily. Follow the recipe and don't add more butter until AFTER you add the nutella. Sometimes I add more of an ingredient if I notice the consistency isn't to my liking. But in this one, the nutella is functioning as a butter substitute. When you first add the butter, it will seem like there is too much sugar. Don't add anything extra until after the nutella is added. Along that note, she says to absolutely not overmeasure on the flour. However, the second time I made these, I added juuust a bit more flour after the rest was already combined. It made for a lot better of a texture and also balanced out the heavily sweetened batter.  You can overdo it on the sea salt. It definitely ties the dish together IF DONE CORRECTLY so just don't be too liberal and it should be all good :)   Ingredients:   1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature 3/4 cup (150g) packed light brown sugar 1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar 1 large Eggland's Best egg + 1 egg yolk 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 cup (148g) Nutella, divided1 2 and 1/3 cups (295g) all-purpose flour (absolutely do not overmeasure- spoon and level) 1 and 1/4 teaspoons baking soda 1 teaspoon cornstarch 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 and 1/4 cups (225g) semi-sweet chocolate chips, divided sea salt, to taste   Directions:   Preheat oven to 350F. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. (Always recommended for cookies.) Set aside. In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter for 1 minute on medium speed until completely smooth and creamy. Add the brown sugar and granulated sugar and beat on medium high speed until fluffy and light in color. Beat in egg, egg yolk, and vanilla on high speed until combined. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Beat in 1/4 cup (74g) of Nutella until combined. Whisk the flour, cornstarch, baking soda and salt together in a large bowl. On low speed, slowly mix into the wet ingredients until combined. Add 1 cup (180g) of chocolate chips and mix on low for about 5-10 seconds until evenly disbursed. Turn the mixer off and add the remaining Nutella. Beat for 5-10 seconds so the Nutella streaks through the cookie dough and is not fully mixed. Dough will be a little crumbly, that is OK. Dough will be extremely crumbly if the remaining Nutella was mixed in too much. Scoop and roll balls of dough, about 1 Tablespoon of dough each, into balls. The warmth of your hands will help them come together. Bake the cookies for 10 minutes, until slightly golden brown around the edges. My oven has hot spots and yours may too- so, be sure to rotate the pan once during bake time. The baked cookies will look extremely soft in the centers when you remove them from the oven. Allow to cool for 5 minutes on the cookie sheet. During this time, if the cookies are too puffy, try gently pressing down on them with the back of a spoon. They will slightly deflate as you let them cool. As the cookies cool, grab the remaining 1/4 cup of chocolate chips. Gently press a few chocolate chips into the tops of the slightly warm cookies (this is for looks and optional, of course!) and finish each with a sprinkle with sea salt. Transfer cookies to a cooling rack to cool completely."

I would recommend putting parchment paper in between to keep the tops from peeling when you pull them out. I don't know what frosting you are using but you can freeze buttercream frosting for up to a month without affecting the consistency too much. Although, since your wedding is Saturday, you can just bake and assemble your cupcakes tomorrow (Thursday) and refrigerate them until Saturday just fine. Unless there is fruit involved, then it needs to be no earlier than Friday."

I do this with my mini-cakes I have for cake tastings, too. From what I've heard you don't need to go through quite as much trouble as this, I'm just insane.  For fridge, I'd do the same as above, minus the aluminum foil - but you can probably either a) just wrap in plastic wrap or b) just freezer bag it with parchment paper on top. No more than 7 days playing it safe.  Decorated cupcakes will depend on the colors, icing, fillings, etc. I've never tried to store decorated cakes or cupcakes for longer than 2 days and wouldn't try to store 6 dozen decorated.  I'd bake them whenever you have the time and freeze them, provided you have the freezer space. Unwrap and thaw them on the counter until at room temperature on Thursday, then decorate on Thursday & Friday as needed, storing in your carrier boxes in the fridge until Saturday.

Baking,37dpcw,AU_YoureDead,2,Tue May 26 21:44:31 2015 UTC,"If the factory is up to standard it could be fine.   I'd walk over when you open the carton, take a big ole whiff and check it's not weirdly separated, and probably taste it. It'll be obvious if it's off in a toxic way, smelling like methane or acid or almond or just anything that's not cream.   I know people who put unopened bottles of cream in the fridge for months past the date until it turned and separated... then it was ready to eat. Cream cheese, allegedly."
Baking,37dpcw,SpamEggsBaconAndSpam,2,Wed May 27 03:01:21 2015 UTC,"I don't have a problem using cream up to 2-3 weeks past its expiry date, as long as it doesn't smell weird, look weird, taste weird, or have a weird texture. If it hasn't been opened at all then it's often fine.  I would feel very uncomfortable using cream that's more than two months past its expiry date, whether or not it is still sealed.  If you're cooking for other people, it's not worth the risk of an awful-tasting dish, or making people sick.  If it's just for you... How badly do you need cream, and how hard is it to go buy more?"

I put them on their sides so you see a ring of macarons on their sides then a smaller ring till the tin is filled.  They're much more stable on their side and that way they don't get weighted down. Put parchment in between the layers. If you stack them flat the top ones are going to eventually squish the bottom ones and the fillings not going to look right.

I took a look at the recipe you linked to, some things I noticed:    Add an additional egg yolk Let the dough rest in the fridge overnight in addition to letting it rise for 1h. Letting the doughnuts rise for 1h @ room temp will likely result in overproof dough. You want what is called a 3/4 proof (at least in germany), that means if you pinch the dough with your finger, it will return to its original shape, but only very slowly.  180°C can be a little too hot. Go for something like 165°C, especially if you don't have a deep fryer."

Baking,377p1i,energeticstarfish,50,Mon May 25 15:43:23 2015 UTC,"This is gonna sound stupid, but you did add flour right? You see how the chips are all in the center? That means when you put your rounded spoonful of dough on the pan the chips never left that spot and the rest of the dough spread as it cooked. So the dough wasn't thick enough to carry the chips out as it spread. I've added melted butter to choc chip cookies before, on accident and on purpose, and I've never seen it do this. So i'm fairly confident it's not the butter. So I think some how you got the ratio wrong and there isn't enough flour or there is too much butter. The only other things i can think of would be too much of certain ingredients like salt or vanilla extract, or maybe a severe temp issue, like way too low. But I feel like you would have noticed that.   edit: not to be an ass, but other comments talking about baking soda/powder are not correct. The Nestle recipe doesn't use BP. So even if your BS is out of date it doesnt matter because sodium bicarbonate doesn't ""go out of date"". It doesn't lose potency. The only way BS goes bad is if it gets wet. Even if you live in a area with high humidity (as I do) that shit is still good for years."

Also remember not to put it on a hot tray as that will cause the butter in the dough to melt too fast and they will just collapse and merge. Rolling the dough into balls should help too and prevent them from flattening too soon, just make sure you leave enough space between them."

Baking,377p1i,bakedbakerbaking414,6,Mon May 25 17:23:31 2015 UTC,"This is very simple. Whether the butter is melted or not, has no impact on what happened here. Neither does baking powder or soda. Eggs? Nope.  You've simply got the wrong ratio of wet to dry ingredients.   Or perhaps you expect a full, tall cookie from a flat recipe and have out too much dough on the pan.   The Toll house recipe is notorious for this. Same thing happened to me.  With the Toll House recipe, you cannot make the dough balls any larger than a tablespoon. They're a FLAT cookie.  Add to that the wrong ratio and you end up with what you have."
Baking,377p1i,Zapapple,4,Mon May 25 20:08:24 2015 UTC,"Freeze your cookies before baking them, and allow the dough to rest in the fridge for at least an hour. I do this with all of my cookie dough. There is something to be said about the butter being too soft as well (per u/RiotGirlll 's comment); this will change how the dry ingredients combine with the fat. I make like 3 batches of cookies a day at work, and I have no problems with creaming the butter for too long, so long as I allow the dough to rest before using it; you just want the butter to firm up again before bakin. This allows for the water in the butter to evaporate out more slowly and therefore your cookies will rise more."

And when measuring ingredients, use a measuring cup/spoons; cereal spoons and mugs are not the best guess measurements.  But anyhoo, with a good batter, you should be able to make 'em into solid balls, and they should be able to keep their form on their own. Should have about consistency like this.  If it helps any, I know everyone always softens the butter, but I melt it in the microwave when I don't have time, and they always come out fine.

Baking,377p1i,vansnagglepuss,1 point,Tue May 26 01:51:56 2015 UTC,"Not enough flour, for sure. With new recipes I always bake just one to check the spread and if it's too much, you need to add a bit of flour."
Baking,377p1i,porkanaut,2,Tue May 26 03:16:47 2015 UTC,"My guess is overbeating during the butter and sugar creaming. I did that last month. I got distracted and beat it 2-3 times longer and the cookies went completely flat. Also, do you always use silpat? I've heard they produce flattter cookies than parchment."
Baking,377p1i,vansnagglepuss,3,Mon May 25 16:32:47 2015 UTC,How long? I cream for at least 8 minutes.
Baking,377p1i,porkanaut,2,Mon May 25 17:01:22 2015 UTC,8 Minutes? Seriously? In the bakeshop we cream for no more than 3 minutes on 3rd gear. So think like speed 7 on a kitchenaid.
Baking,377p1i,vansnagglepuss,1 point,Mon May 25 21:42:03 2015 UTC,Yeah I go to about 5-6 on my kitchen aid. But it's not industrial so wouldn't a normal mixer or beater take longer?
Baking,377p1i,porkanaut,3,Mon May 25 22:09:33 2015 UTC,"Not necessairly, precisely creamed is relative to the temperature of the butter, coarseness of the sugar, speed of the mixer, ambient room temperature and such.   Cookies are creamed until light, it's easy to take it too far. The longer you cream your cookies, the further they spread.   Cakes are creamed until the butter and sugar are super light and fluffy and that helps give them leavening power and their texture. I always cream my cakes for 10 minutes on 2nd gear, since creaming at a lower speed results in more stable sugar+butter emulsion."
Baking,377p1i,nickiday,1 point,Mon May 25 22:22:06 2015 UTC,I dunno about that because my cookies don't spread like that. They spread just enough and come out nice and fluffy in texture on the inside and slightly crisp on the outside.   I think it's all relatable to many different factors. I never fully trust a recipie until Probably the third time making it and tweaking it.   I cream cakes the same way - 10 mins.

Baking,377p1i,Tytillean,1 point,Mon May 25 18:10:03 2015 UTC,"Really not sure what you did here. You might've forgotten something.... a few somethings, or you beat it to death. Either way cookies are pretty great things to try out different things.   That's an interesting recipe. If you're trying to figure out what went wrong then i'd suggest making small modifications to the recipe to isolate what went wrong. Gut feeling says too little flour in your batch, but the recipe could be somewhat off too. Try adding another 1/3 cup of all-purpose, don't add the eggs 1 by 1 instead try adding them all in a pool, breaking their yolk and then mixing to incorporate. While you're add it you could lower the brown sugar content by substituting some white sugar and then adding a touch of baking powder (soda wont have as much acidity to react to so extra leavening will be needed for that and the extra weight of the flour)  Will have less work on the eggs and produce a more cakey cookie which means more structure and therefore no puddle of cookies."

Baking,37a9dv,bored_not_working,2,Tue May 26 03:22:39 2015 UTC,"Situation and Recipe:    So, I was making my usual half batch of chocolate chip cookies and absent-mindedly ended up using the regular amount o everything except butter.    I didn't have enough butter, or it turned out, chocolate chips for a full batch, so I subbed in vegetable oil for the rest of the butter, and a large dollop of Nutella to make up for the chips.    As I write this I realized that I forgot one egg too. I'm a mess.    RECIPE     2 1/4 cups flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 1 stick butter, softened 1/2 cup vegetable oil 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 cup packed brown sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 large egg 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate morsels 1 large dollop Nutella (probably about 2-2.5 tablespoons)   I creamed the butter, vanilla and sugars as normal after combining the dry ingredients in a separate bowl.    I added the egg, and mixed well.    After I started to beat in dry mixture, I realized my lack of butter, and added the vegetable oil.       After beating in all dry ingredients, I added the chocolate chips, and then decided on the Nutella.  Once mixed I scooped them into rounded balls and baked at 375 for 10 minutes.       The resulting cookies are chocolatey and taste of Nutella. They are a slight bit grainy, and a little drier than usual, but taste good and hold together well despite being an egg short of usual.      This is my first situation of improvising while baking and overall turned out well!"

Baking,379fed,lilianminx,2,Mon May 25 23:17:56 2015 UTC,"One thing you could try is simply editing a banana bread/cake recipe, perhaps in small (half or quarter batches) in case you have a few fails/subpar results. (I know I've made some VERY dense cakes in my time through experimenting/accidental undercooking -- I don't mind much, especially when they're warm, but the texture is a little bizarre, like a fruit brownie, and I don't think I'd be very happy if I had several full-sized cakes in a row turn out that way. It would get old.) You might find something that tastes right by trying that, even if it's not the same thing.  For example, I made this cake the other day and subbed half the banana for apple sauce. (1 banana = approx 1/2 cup volume, so I baked this with one mashed banana and 1/2 cup apple sauce.) It turned out very well. I think apple sauce will give you a slightly denser/wetter final product, so you might want to consider adding some extra flour or decreasing the amount a bit (e.g. if a recipe asks for 1 cup of banana, maybe try 3/4 cup apple sauce).  A final idea: you know those individual servings of apple sauce meant to be packed in a lunch bag? They're great for baking, because you don't end up with half a jar of apple sauce and no real plans for what to do with it. Motts apple sauce comes in 6x~100g (~1/2 cup) packs is basically the same price as a jar of apple sauce containing ~600g, like maybe a couple dimes' difference. I like apple sauce, but I don't necessarily want to have to eat cups of the stuff just because I felt like baking with apple sauce!"

Baking,377qoz,Clownaround,4,Mon May 25 15:56:30 2015 UTC,"I'm in the states and there are a lot of local rules regarding food sales, such as an amateur baking business. In my area there's different variations of what you can do. There's something called cottage industry that allows you to bake out of your home, but you must allow for a health inspection and you must label everything accurately. Another option to to open in a space where you would have a normal license for food selling. A third option , and one I went with, is to rent time in a professional kitchen. A deli near my home closes at 4 during the week so I was able to rent time in their already licensed kitchen and the use of their equipment.  If you can I would suggest looking into local laws governing food sales and move on from there.  A good quality web site is a must with this, and I would also include paper menus. You have to be specific enough about your products, what you are and not willing to do and the extra fees involved. Example is I agreed to make a toy story cake for a woman, and she ended up adding on 4 dozen cupcakes which included hand painted decorations. I blindly agreed to the cupcakes without realizing her expectations. I probably made .25$ an hour hand painting with food coloring.   Another example is people requesting cake flavors I've never made, or cookies that I've never made. You have to be specific. Another thing is expectation of travel. I made a wedding shower cake for a woman that included me driving nearly an hour there and an hour back for it. She seemed put off by me saying that over 15 miles in distance I charge a small delivery fee. Once I explained it she totally got it."

Baking,373u2t,tiniature,7,Sun May 24 18:50:49 2015 UTC,"Sure!  It's a pretty basic scone recipe, that I just add different flavors to.    Ingredients:  2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour  1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar  1 tablespoon baking powder  3/4 teaspoon coarse salt  1/2 cup (1 stick) cold unsalted sweet cream butter, cut into small pieces  3/4 cup buttermilk  1 teaspoon vanilla  1 large egg yolk  1 1/2 cups fresh fruit  Directions:  Preheat oven to 400.  In a food processor, pulse together flour, cup sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add butter and pulse until pea-size pieces form.  In a small bowl, whisk together buttermilk and egg yolk. Slowly pour buttermilk mixture through feed tube into processor, pulsing until dough just comes together. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and sprinkle fruit on top. Knead three times to fold in fruit. Form dough into a flattened circle, cut into 8 wedge shapes and sprinkle tops with 1 tablespoon sugar. Bake until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes, rotating sheets halfway through."
Baking,373u2t,tiniature,5,Sun May 24 19:01:29 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but that says 21 1/2 cups.  Is it supposed to be 2 1/2 or 1 1/2?"
Baking,373u2t,TheDarkKitten95,2,Sun May 24 21:18:25 2015 UTC,Ahhhh. It's supposed to be 2 1/2 cups.  Stupid typos.
Baking,373u2t,SarahJujitsu,2,Sun May 24 23:43:43 2015 UTC,Thanks!
Baking,373u2t,Echilon,2,Sun May 24 23:50:20 2015 UTC,"You don't mean 21 cups of flour, do you?"
Baking,373u2t,MissCecilyCardew,2,Sun May 24 23:20:10 2015 UTC,Oh no!  2 1/2 cups.  Sorry!  :|
Baking,375w8e,olivelucy,2,Mon May 25 03:42:26 2015 UTC,Lol! Love it. This is my kind of clock.
Baking,376qm2,D__H,1 point,Mon May 25 09:43:01 2015 UTC,that looks delicious! it looks like it has the perfect amount of crusty crunchiness
Baking,376qm2,olForge,1 point,Mon May 25 15:36:01 2015 UTC,We're the dots because of the shaping? The bread looks great. The steam from inside the bread looks for the weakest point to escape so it explodes out of wherever that is. Try scoring the top a few times with a sharp knife. It looks yummy!
Baking,376qm2,Attatrix,1 point,Mon May 25 17:26:36 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of my early goes with bread. You got the ""potato loaf"" that I used to pump out regularly, and I say that with a great big smile on my face. For a second go it is definitely very good. Your crumb looks good, the crust is good for somebody just starting out.  Going forward, I would definitely recommend working on your shaping (it takes a while to get the hang of). Work on getting a tight skin formed but without ripping the skin as well, there is a line between tight and too tight. And like /u/Attatrix said, score the loaf. If scored proper you likely would not have had the seam blow out in photo 3.  Damn good showing for a 2nd loaf and only 1 week of bread making. Keep it up, who knows you could be the next Chad Robertson one day! :)"
Baking,376qm2,mr_richichi,1 point,Wed May 27 01:03:25 2015 UTC,"Hehe... Thanks for supportive words.. For my start, I definitely did not care much about some shapes etc.. Right now, on the top, there should be my attemp no.3, where I already took a care a bit more about that.. :D  Why not to have beautifuly potato-shaped bread.. After all, you cut it into slices, eat it and these chemicals in your body, they do the rest..   But I think I will enjoy experimenting with some different shapes.. I am not any ""chef"", but I live on my own since 17 (now 32), so I kind of enjoy cooking.. (who would feed me otherwise?? right?)"
Baking,376qm2,mr_richichi,1 point,Wed May 27 19:30:22 2015 UTC,"Right on and thats the spirit that you need in baking. Gotta enjoy every second of it.  Not gonna lie, my potato loaf is still to this day made one of my favorite paninis. The irregular shape doesn't take away from the flavor at all. I always liked to describe mine as ""rustic"" loaves any time they blew out. Will take a look at #3. Hope the bread is treating you well."
Baking,374v2v,LadyTrekkie42,2,Sun May 24 22:08:00 2015 UTC,The cake itself was just plain vanilla sponge with vanilla buttercream. The cupcakes were apple and cinnamon with a custard buttercream.
Baking,374v2v,PotatoGoddess,2,Sun May 24 22:08:46 2015 UTC,"Both of those flavors sound delicious, and the decoration is top-notch. I bet he loved it. Well done! Could you share the recipe for the cupcakes?"
Baking,374v2v,PotatoGoddess,3,Mon May 25 00:11:57 2015 UTC,"Hi, Im so sorry, I got home and just flaked. Here's the ingredients and recipe:   Apple Filling Ingredients   1/2 tbsp cornflour 2 tsp water 2 medium granny smith apples/cooking apples 2tsp ground cinnamon 30g unsalted butter 70g soft brown sugar   Apples Filling Recipe   Mix cornflour and water together and set aside. Peel and dice applies into 1 cm cubes. Put the apple cubes, cinnamon, butter and sugar in a large frying pan and heat on a medium setting. Stir them regularly, then let them sit for 3 minutes. They should go slightly translucent. Pour the water and cornflour mix into the pan and stir for about 30 seconds.  Take them off the heat and let it cool.   Cupcake Ingredients   300g unsalted butter (room temperature) 250g soft brown sugar 4 large eggs 320g self-raising sugar 2.5 tsp ground cinnamon pinch of salt 70 apple sauce or extra apple filling 380-420g apple filling   (I just used all my apple filling)  Cupcakes Recipe   Preheat oven to 180'C/160'C (fan)/gas mark 4. Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. I normally melt my butter, I prefer the outcome. Add the eggs one at a time Add the flour, cinnamon and salt mixing until fully combined. Fold in the apple mix until well combined Cook for 25-30 minutes Leave the oven on to cook the crumble (see below)   Crumble Topping Ingredients   100g unsalted butter 120g soft brown sugar  300g plain flour 2 tsp cold water   Crumble Topping Recipe   Put the butter, sugar and flour into a bowl Rub the flour into the mixture until it becomes like breadcrumbs Ad the cold water and mix until its all just combined Place the mixture into the freezer for 15 minutes Spread the mix evenly on a tray and bake for 20 - 25 minutes, or until golden brown.   Custard Buttercream Icing Ingredients   170g unsalted butter (room temperature) 50g custard powder 350g icing sugar 4 tbsp milk   Custard Buttercream Icing Recipe   Put all the ingredients into a bowl and beat until combined It might look like its split but its okay, just add more icing sugar until its the consistency you want.   Notes   I burnt my crumble because I wasnt paying attention, which is why it's not pictured, but it is delicious.  I melt my butter for the cakes and the buttercream. I know it's not conventional to do so but I find the consistency so much better when I do. For the cinnamon, go nuts. I always add more than any recipes say. Same goes for vanilla in different recipes. Tastes so much better with extra cinnamon, in my opinion anyway!   Bake them and let me know what you think :D I'm obsessed with them so I wanna share the love haha"
Baking,37459d,SenseiKrystal,3,Sun May 24 18:31:40 2015 UTC,They remind me of wild berry pop tarts!
Baking,37459d,SillyIncantations,3,Mon May 25 02:07:34 2015 UTC,Those cookies look really soft and soft sugar cookies are he bomb.com! What's the recipe??
Baking,37459d,Phallic_Callop,3,Mon May 25 00:18:00 2015 UTC,"I got it from allrecipes.com, and it's super easy!  http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Cracked-Sugar-Cookies-I  The frosting is just powdered sugar, butter, milk, and vanilla extract. I was looking for cookies that I could make without going to the store."
Baking,376hjd,bernath,1 point,Mon May 25 07:32:32 2015 UTC,These are so good! I overfilled the muffin cups and the muffin tops spread into each other. The edges of the muffin tops are super crispy and the inside cake is hearty and moist but not gummy. I soaked the raisins in some coconut rum before adding them for a little extra something.

Baking,375ike,FurbyWan,2,Mon May 25 01:37:17 2015 UTC,So I know that bananas turning pink is definitely a thing. If you've ever had Thai Banana Sticky Rice cooked in a banana leaf the bananas in there are steamed and turn pink inside. If you can bananas they can turn pink and a lot of banana baby food is pink. I looked it up and there wasn't a lot of information that I could find but someone said possibly oxidation. Sorry if this wasn't helpful but even though it's pink it should still be delicious.
Baking,375ike,kt-bug,1 point,Mon May 25 04:36:42 2015 UTC,Okay thanks for the tip.
Baking,3758r9,jackster_,2,Mon May 25 00:08:19 2015 UTC,"No one wants to talk about sourdough? Okay. I know some of you have read this post, as it has a few upvotes, but no one wants to comment. Maybe /r/baking isn't the right sub for this, I guess I will take my conversation to /r/breadit, now that I know that exists. Il come back with a picture, when I bake one of my froofroo cakes. :-|"

Baking,3723kb,Tytillean,1 point,Sun May 24 03:43:56 2015 UTC,Thank you! I know exactly what you mean. I've been putting it off for weeks thinking it was going to be difficult. But it all came together pretty easily. The hardest part was frosting around the bottom on that too-small plate.
Baking,3723kb,evixir,3,Sun May 24 14:37:47 2015 UTC,Looks good. My first one looked like an avalanche.

Baking,373gad,ps_,1 point,Sun May 24 17:29:57 2015 UTC,I got the recipe from here http://thefirstyearblog.com/starbucks-pumpkin-pound-cake/ but I also changed it a bit.
