dankgatmaymays,3cxjrd,Zombiedrd,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:15:47 2015 UTC,"When you say +20 guns, are we talking Hi points, or some quality firearms? If he gave up a lot of guns for a fiance (how he got to that stage and didn't know she was anti gun is beyond me), she must have really been worth it."

He knew she was an anti, he thought maybe he could convince, when they started to discuss marriage and living together, she said she would not be in a house, nor raise a child with the death objects(Her real phrasing).  He decided being with her was more important. Was almost a decade ago, and they are still together and have two kids, so I guess it was for him."

dankgatmaymays,3cc4jo,Iggins01,0,Tue Jul 7 05:38:12 2015 UTC,"Nope /u/hydrogenous logged in when he heard about me trying to get it before anyone else could. He removed the voat.co link and turned the sub on.   I was working with the mods at the time to take it over, they informed me that he turned the sub back on and would remain the mod.  He had a really bad morning and I gave him some slack, every thing is worked out now and he is back running /r/firearms  the way he always ran it.   All I ever wanted was for the sub to be active. If he would have not responded I would have taken it over and I would like to think that I would have ran it just as good as him."
dankgatmaymays,3cc4jo,hydrogenous,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:47:52 2015 UTC,The Voat link is still up. I think a sub that big should be forced to have more than one moderator in order to place a checks and balances system. So if he bans someone for whay ever reason there is no legit appeals process or mod discussion.  So if a single mod or just doesn't like a user there is no one to keep them in check.
dankgatmaymays,3cc4jo,Iggins01,3,Tue Jul 7 05:52:22 2015 UTC,"The Voat link is still up.   Yes, it has been on the sidebar since last winter and it will remain there. What parabox1 was talking about was the splash page you see when a sub is set to private. It said something like ""I am also the sole moderator of voat.co/v/firearms, and you are welcome to join us over there"". I put the link up so there would still be a place for people to exchange ideas during the blackout.    I think a sub that big should be forced to have more than one moderator in order to place a checks and balances system. So if he bans someone for whay ever reason there is no legit appeals process or mod discussion.    Subreddits are run worse than /r/firearms. The only check and balance that we have is my own integrity. If you haven't noticed by now based on the events of the past 24-hours, I'm usually willing to accept fault, learn from mistakes, and above all else attempt to correct those mistakes. The way /r/firearms is run is that the community makes all the big decisions. The only exception are trolls and spammers. I ban them with impunity.  I have only banned one or two trolls and countless scores of spammers. I have banned people and then turned around and removed it when they appealed to me.    So if a single mod or just doesn't like a user there is no one to keep them in check.   I wanted to ban /u/parabox1 this morning. But I didn't.  I thought about how I could stretch the definition of troll, but that wouldn't be right. I know you don't know how heated I was in our PMs and comments, but if I could stay level-headed enough to not swing the ban hammer at him, chances are pretty good I won't abuse my position."
dankgatmaymays,3cc4jo,hydrogenous,2,Tue Jul 7 06:55:51 2015 UTC,"I never saw the splash page when you went private. I never poked around the sub until after the blackout.  As for the two moderator thing I was thinking it would be more helpful as a backup in case someone goes vacation innawoods or life happens like it usually does and renders someone off the Internet for a period of time. Along the lines of giving a spare key to your neighbor so they can feet your gat cat while you are gone.  Your stlye of moderation with /r/firearms is a low overhead sort of deal of don't troll don't spam, it doesn't take much effort to enforce that. It can be easily done with one man and his bot. I just thought it would be a good general rule of thumb to have back up mod for so many users in case the single mod goes MIA for a bit.  Also it's good you didn't ban hammer /u/parabox1 but you can still dick slap him a bit if you want"
dankgatmaymays,3cc4jo,TheBoldakSaints,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:32:18 2015 UTC,The sub is live and as so he can link to other sites if he wishes. I do agree with you that a sub that large should have more then one mod. But being the only mod he lets the sub run it self and does not really ban people.  He does a good job at it I think I could help him and had offered in the past. Every one has a bad day and ever one needs to be checked every now and then.    I know I need it from time to time.
