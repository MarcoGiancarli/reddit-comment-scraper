In the UK I doubt it could ever come back. Some ultra conservative types (not Tory's exactly) might support it but they're such a minority.

I think it will come back at some point but privacy concerns, equal rights, and our economic problems are seen as more important. In addition the number of people being executed is on the decline just because of how damn expensive and time consuming it is.

Infographics,3dnr15,CanadianGuy116,3,Fri Jul 17 20:19:34 2015 UTC,I understand what you are saying - and you might see it wonderfully on your monitor certainly - i know for a fact that mine isn't balanced for graphics work. If i did have my CS on here I would throw some Pantone alternatives.   Personally I would go for a very soft teal background & drop the black stroke on the lettering for solid blue a few shades darker than the full water jug. I am just not a fan of blocks of stroked text. Rough idea of course but the point I am trying to make is you need the jugs to 'pop' otherwise your point is lost.   Pull it up on your screen and get up and walk to the far wall from your work station - if you can't tell the difference easily from there.. . reconsider the color scheme.

Infographics,3d9u4a,CraigyDavi,37,Tue Jul 14 16:58:09 2015 UTC,Why is acceleration used for ships at sub-light velocity and then velocity used for ships faster than light? Comparing acceleration to velocity on a bar chart makes no sense.
Infographics,3d9u4a,Winslow1132,19,Tue Jul 14 18:57:32 2015 UTC,"Actually, this didn't bother me so much, and in a way it makes sense. If you don't count ships that can travel faster than light, then a ship's velocity is determined by how fast it can accelerate and how long it is doing so. In space, you can ""hold down the accelerator"", so to to speak, and keep speeding up (until you run out of fuel). So any ship can reach any speed, and it makes more sense to compare how quickly they can get to that speed (i.e. their acceleration).  Of course, even if you disregard fuel, there's still relativistic effects to account for, so you can't actually reach any speed, just any speed less than the speed of light. But let's ignore that too. And this infographic makes that distinction by separating faster-than-light ships, so I'm ok with that.  On the other hand, many of these max accelerations and velocities seem to completely made up and highly inconsistent, so that does bother me. End of rant."

Infographics,3d9u4a,banquof,3,Tue Jul 14 22:21:58 2015 UTC,"Warp speeds are a little bit inconsistent. Back in Kirk's day, it was just a scale that went up, so they could achieve speeds of warp 12, 13, and so forth (though generally by the time they get over warp 10, they were really tearing ass, and probably putting the ship in danger to do so). Sometime between The Original Series and The Next Generation, Starfleet reconfigured it to a logarithmic scale, so that warp 1 = 1C, and from there I'm not so clear the exchange rate, until you hit warp 10 which is literally infinite speed, at which you would occupy every point in the universe simultaneously, and which cannot be reached.  Then there was a truly atrocious Voyager episode where they exceeded warp 10 anyway, and it was mind breakingly stupid. We do not speak of this episode."

We'd put on financial fairs with free food (Panda Express catered) and the only people that would show up are those that were required to for some program or other.  For those that want good credit it isn't that hard if you start in high school. Unfortunately it's not until their credit is ruined that many people start to care. It's hard to get this through to people but if we can't convince people that finishing high school and staying away from meth is a good idea then how do we convince these same people that building a good credit score is a good idea."

If you have problem credit get it fixed as soon as you can. Even if you don't plan on getting a loan in the near future. Don't fall for scams there is no easy way to fix credit.

Infographics,3cx66m,Foggalong,17,Sat Jul 11 15:53:32 2015 UTC,"I was raised on military bases for a good part of my childhood during the cold war, it was interesting and the constant paranoia was not all that different from the constant paranoia we are now in for the war on terror.  I lived in what was called a first strike town, meaning that in the event of a nuclear war the Soviets were likely to strike the town I lived in because it had an airforce base with bombers capable of delivering nuclear warheads. In the days before cell phones, and even pagers, it was common to be out at Pizza Hut or someplace and see a bomber pilot tell the manager of the restaurant that he is a pilot and that in the case of an emergency the restaurant might receive a call for him. Pilots were required to tell people when they went that they were there, and would have to tell their commanding officers where they would be when they left home.   My schools had bomb shelters built into them, to this day you will still sometimes see these shelters in older schools. We used to do bombing drills and do the classic duck and cover. The airforce base had a really loud air raid alarm system that they used to test once a week at noon on Fridays if I recall correctly.   There were lots of similarities to the current war on terror. There were newsreels that would tell people that anyone who questions US foreign policy might be a communist. In those days everyone who was not 100% behind every US foreign policy decision was a potential communist in the eyes of many people. When the department of Homeland Security started their whole ""If you see something, say something"" campaign I was so disappointed, especially when they went so far as to post these videos in Walmart.   So we were taught to not trust anyone who was even remotely critical of America during the Cold War, and it is not much different now with the war on terror. Although now we are all subject to mass surveillance the like of which people like Joseph McCarthy would have killed babies to have had access to for communist witch hunts. Also we are all subject to searches at large events and airports because anyone could be a spooky terrorist. We weren't really exposed to that kind of scrutiny during the Cold War.  Basically, the constant threat of nuclear annihilation was not that different from the constant threat of terrorism in a lot of ways, but both the Cold War and the War on Terror will look ridiculous in hindsight, but lots of Americans take it way too seriously."

Infographics,3csb9s,ShitzN,20,Fri Jul 10 11:53:58 2015 UTC,"Me too, but perhaps it's like vote splitting. Just because the Conservatives form government doesn't mean the majority of the country voted Conservative.  What I mean is, there are so many excellent beers available in Canada (and these days the US as well, let's be fair) that lots of people have specific favourites. When I was young, I loved Sleeman Honey Brown. Later I went through a Molson Dry phase (much cheaper than Sleeman!). My female friends liked Alexander Keith's or Steamwhistle, and for a few years my best friend swore by Creemore Springs. When I lived in Vancouver I chose lots of local brews, the names of which I can't even remember.  So with that much variety, it may not be surprising that a mass market beer manages to come out on top - when it's BBQ at the cottage season, you're not picky, and you want to buy a two-four of cans, the cheapest and most popular option may very well be Budweiser."
Infographics,3csb9s,MossTheTree,5,Fri Jul 10 12:46:26 2015 UTC,I've lived in Ontario my whole life and Bud is not as popular as Canadian or Coors Light.   Other provinces chime in?

Infographics,3cp5km,twofifteen,7,Fri Jul 10 01:35:34 2015 UTC,"Now I want to see how much these drugs cost to produce. Even including R&D, I can't imagine these prices being even close to justifiable."
Infographics,3cp5km,mjackl,5,Thu Jul 9 22:21:46 2015 UTC,"well I just did some simple math on the most expensive drug on the list, Eculizumab (Soliris).  It's a drug that is used to treat Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria which, according to wikipedia, affects between 1-2 people per million.  From some googleing it looks like a low end price to bring a drug to market is about $1 billion.  So, using these figures, and the 7 billion population of the planet we can guess that the total number of people alive currently that have this disease is (at the highest end) 14,000.  If we divide 1 billion by 14,000 we get a little above $70,000.  So in order for the company to make any money every single person that has the disease would have to pay around $70,000.    You also have to consider the fact that people who have this disease in undeveloped countries aren't going to be able to afford it anyway, so they need to be taken out of the equation.  According to the population reference bureau only about 1.2 billion people lived in ""more developed"" countries in 2013.  So out of those 1.2 billion, only about 2400 people will have it.  This would mean that in order to recoup the costs to bring the drug to market the drug would have to cost each person with the disease a little over $415,000.    I'm actually kinda surprised that this figure came so close to the stated $409,500 the drug supposedly costs for a year.  You also have to understand that most of those 2400 people probably won't be able to afford the drug themselves, even though they live in a ""more developed country"".  Unless there is something I'm missing, it looks like the company will have a hard time breaking even."
Infographics,3cp5km,TheHast,2,Fri Jul 10 01:36:35 2015 UTC,"So let's assume your math is roughly correct. That would mean that the company would make back most or all of their investment after one year. So every year after that for the rest of these people's lives is pure profit that company. Not only for the rest of their lives, but for the foreseeable future. Several decades could go by before a cheaper alternative or cure is found. So, using some fairly rough estimates, if they sell that drug for 10 years, they've made about $10 billion in profit."
Infographics,3cp5km,mjackl,4,Fri Jul 10 02:29:02 2015 UTC,"The numbers aren't correct. In the pharmaceutical industry, a drug that makes $1 Billion per year is called a ""Blockbuster"" and really only ever happens for drugs in super common therapeutic areas (diabetes, hypertension, anticoagulation, asthma, etc...) where millions of insured American patients people are affected and the cash price for the medication is more like $3-500/ month. A drug at that price is probably extremely expensive to produce, and is very unlikely to be very profitable. That isn't to say it won't turn a profit, but it will NEVER make $10billion in 10 years."

If it's some long term illness and you can't pay for medication no one is required to treat you for free.  For the most part I support free market solutions to problems like this, but I'd rather not get into a fight on the internet.  From my point of view the problem with the American health care system isn't that it is too socialist or capitalist, but that it's neither.  It's some fucked up amalgamation of the two where everyone is trying to fuck everyone else.  In my opinion the American health care system would be much better off if it was completely government run and centrally planned or if it was completely free market.  Personally I would lean toward free market because you run into things like rising expectations clashing with a demand for lower costs using a government run solution."

I hope you understand what I mean by that. It's like bad dentists that destroy your teeth for making you come back: imagine with cancer or things like that.

Yes, sharks kill relatively few people each year, but people only come into contact with them at the beach (well, primarily), so you have to take into account how risky it is to be in the water. I don't drive to work thinking ""I hope a sharknado doesn't kill me today"". I see horses more often than I swim in the ocean. Ants are everywhere (but it doesn't specifiy what types can kill people). I'm sure some Africans (and I guess Zoo workers) see Hippos every day. Mosquitoes are also everywhere.   I'd like to see a few different sets of data, such as ""annual kills"", ""annual kills vs Annual non-fatal bites/attacks"", and ""annual kills vs annual [potential] encounters"" such as ""shark bites vs total number of visits to the beach""  A common example is that vending machines kill more people than sharks. I see them every day. I pass 6 at work. But I imagine most of those deaths involve people improperly maneuvering them or trying to tip them over.  Space accidents have only killed what, a dozen people in 75 years? But only a few dozen people have been to space."

Infographics,3cdsat,datacritique,9,Tue Jul 7 12:37:39 2015 UTC,"Very flawed reasoning as it does not take into account digestive system, such as length of small intestine vs large intestines and other important distinguishing features. It does not discuss nutritional requirements either. Humans cannot subsist on a purely plant-based diet as humans have lost the ability to synthesize sufficient amounts of vitamin b12. Then there are other important nutrients which cannot be obtained from plants such as creatine, carnitine, choline, vitamin a (many people are unable to properly convert beta carotene to retinol) and omega-3 (plant-derived aa is very inefficiently converted into dha, especially in men). In that sense, meat (or at least some other animal products) is obligatory to humans, albeit small quantities can be sufficient. Vegans can do alright in modern times thanks to supplements, but that does not mean humans could thrive as strict herbivores in pre-modern times. There has never been a vegan society, and all evidence points towards human rapidly becoming carnivores throughout the last two million years."
Infographics,3cdsat,walktothehills,-2,Tue Jul 7 12:34:18 2015 UTC,"There have been and are many vegetarian cultures in the world. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_vegetarianism  B12 can be found in yeasts and a few other sources. Your liver also holds on to b12 for years. The human body does synthesize creatine to the tune of about 1g per day. Not a lot but definitely enough to support proper bodily functions. Carnitine is synthesized in the body and can be found in Avacados, Tempeh, bread, and nuts.   It is definitely possible to live a vegetarian (and even vegan) life with proper nutrition. It has been done for thousands of years. As with any specialized diet, it does take a little bit of knowledge of what to eat in order to get a balanced diet.   Humans are clearly omnivores and I would not at all deny that we have been eating meat for a long time. It is however not unheard of or especially necessary to consume meat in order to get all of your nutrients."
Infographics,3cdsat,ProperFellow,5,Tue Jul 7 13:17:45 2015 UTC,"I was talking about vegan societies, not vegetarian. Vegetarians get b12 from milk and other animal products. And no pre-modern societies consumed yeast to get enough b12, and that was my point. We need animal products, but that can be avoided by supplementation. The fact that supplements are necessary is fairly strong evidence that humans are obligate meat eaters (or animal product eaters). Does that mean that vegetarian diets are bad? Probably not if done properly."
Infographics,3cdsat,walktothehills,4,Tue Jul 7 13:31:00 2015 UTC,"As the earlier link shows, Jains, Taoists, and some Buddhists are vegan and have been for hundreds in in some cases thousands of years. Obligate meat eaters means that eating meat is a requirement for life. In humans that is simply not the case. We are a muddy omnivore. A cat would die on a diet without meat, a cow would die on a diet of meat, humans can live (and have without supplements) on a diet of either or both.   I don't want to sound like eating meat is not part of our evolution. It clearly has been. There are also vitamins, minerals, and amino acids found in some meats that are much harder do get in a vegetarian or vegan diet but it is not a requirement for life that you eat meat. People should still make sure to eat a balanced diet and make sure they have no issues causing deficits but everyone meat eater or not should keep an eye on the nutritional intake."

Infographics,3cdsat,Buffalo__Buffalo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:17:04 2015 UTC,"All those foods were developed in the neolithic period, and has not been apart of the human diet during 99.9% of its evolution.

Regardless, those examples were used because they are the most easily accessible reference points for lacto-fermented foods. I'm afraid that I'm not quite up to speed on my paleolithic cuisine and regional dialects to be able to describe the fermented foods they consumed. Well, apart from wine.  But if we're talking about that then you'd already know that the evidence indicates that humans would ""naturally"" be primarily frugivores with some insectivorousness on the side plus a little opportunistic carnivorism. So what up with that?"
Infographics,3cdsat,Buffalo__Buffalo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:19:05 2015 UTC,"No need to be rude. If you claim that fermentation was an important source of nutrition, you better have sources to back that up. Please provide sources for your claims that humans are frugivores. I think that if we were so, then we would not be able to hold this conversation, due to smaller brain capacity."
Infographics,3cdsat,walktothehills,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:47:13 2015 UTC,"Hey now, you were the one being condescending by assuming that I wasn't aware of what ketchup was made from.  Also, I'd like to draw attention to the fact that we've somehow inexplicably jumped from ""pre-modern"" into ""paleolithic"" diet. I assume that's just an oversight on your behalf.  Next in line is that fact that just because humans may have required certain things in order to evolve the way we have — which would likely also include such things as rape, incest, and even bestiality — doesn't mean that it's necessary today. If that weren't the case then we wouldn't be able to hold this conversation by virtue of the fact that we would be otherwise occupied as subsistence farmers. So obviously that argument doesn't hold much water.  Just like I can't prove when salt was first used as a means to preserve food (which, by the way, is very often the cornerstone of traditionally fermented food) I can't prove much about the fermentation of food given the fact that food naturally and spontaneously ferments. The advent of apple juice which is non-alcoholic is a very recent invention in the context of human society. ""Improperly"" stored foods which are kept in a temperature above freezing (i.e. any stored food prior to modern preservatives and refrigeration) will ferment. More than that, windfall also begins fermenting quickly. Unless you imagine that our ancestors were throwing away food because it was too ripe, a little old or damp, or because it wasn't pasteurized and sealed in an airtight container then the fact of the matter is that most of the food eaten by humans in the paleolithic era had undergone fermentation, the only thing up for debate is the degree of fermentation.  The fact that chimpanzees are our nearest relatives and that we share incredibly similar dentition, digestive tracts, nutritional requirements indicates that humans would have also shared a very similar diet. The other matter is that the archaeological methods for examining human diets is very much skewed to identifying meat consumption. Actually, completely skewed to it."
Infographics,3cdsat,Buffalo__Buffalo,2,Wed Jul 8 12:53:01 2015 UTC,"History of vegetarianism:       The history of vegetarianism has its roots in the civilizations  of ancient India and ancient Greece. Vegetarianism is the theory and practice of voluntary non-consumption of the flesh of any animal (including sea animals), with or without also eschewing other animal derivatives (such as dairy products or eggs).  The earliest records of vegetarianism as a concept and practice amongst a significant number of people concern ancient India  and the ancient Greek civilizations in southern Italy and Greece.  In both instances the diet was closely connected with the idea of nonviolence toward animals (called ahimsa in India), and was promoted by religious groups and philosophers.

Infographics,3cdsat,Gimly,6,Tue Jul 7 11:10:14 2015 UTC,"It is but it is much harder. I am vegetarian and I make sure to eat a balanced diet. I have no issues getting enough vitamins. For vegans the main vitamin to watch is b12. It is found mostly in animal products and is necessary for humans to live. Luckily b12 can be found in a few other sources like some yeasts and your body only needs a very small amount of it to get by.   There are a couple other vitamins and minerals vegans (and vegetarians) should keep an eye on to stay healthy (like iron) but those are easily found outside of animal sources. Interestingly also, protein is not really a concern for most vegans or vegetarians since you can easily get enough protein from beans, lentils, nuts, and other plant sources."

Infographics,3cdsat,Le11on,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:21:54 2015 UTC,"Eating meat has been a drving factor in our evolution. You see, as our brains got larger and we got smarter, they also required more energy. Our brains take up A LOT of energy. And our diet of mostly plants at the time couldn't fuel our intelligence. But we could through meat. So we needed to start hunting. In order to do so, we came up with a new technique called persistence hunting. Basically, we figured out that all the animals that lived in africa could only cool down by panting, and as soon as they start to gallop, they cannot pant. Humans on the other hand, can sweat to cool down. Which means if we can keep up the pace long enough, and prevent the animal we're hunting from being able to rest, we could get it to suffer from heatstroke and collapse (in the video by BBC, David Attenborough said the Kudo collapsed from exhaustion, that was wrong, it was heatstroke that brought it down, although I can't deny that heatstroke was a factor). We are loaded with these adaptations. For instance, our short toes, our long legs and short arms (apes have arms that are longer then their legs, and australopiths had hands that came down to their knees, imaging trying to run like that), our gluteus Maximus, our thin ankles and wrists, better balance due to an enlarged vestibular thingy, eyes that can keep a steadier image while we run, and above all else, the arches in our feet and our achilles tendon act like springs, every step we take, 52% of the energy is absorded by these springs and put into the next step.  Every single one of these adaptations was specifically to help us hunt, and catch animals so we could eat them. A lot of vegans and vegetarians will tell you that humans are herbivores by nature, if that was true, we wouldn't have been able to overcome the high energy demands of our brains. The only way that vegans can ever hope to defend that claim is by cherry picking the crap out of it.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WuB8BhUJrc  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7BfaQ6ZggM"

My point here is that animals that are killed properly for food consumption purposes are not wasted as long as we can keep on hunting/breeding them for generations to come and that there is therefore no harm in eating something weather it is an animal or a plant.   For me, their life has value and it's wasted when we kill the animal only because we like the taste. Like I said before I don't believe that plants have a conscious mind and even if they had, more would die if I'd consume animal products. Besides that, many plants actually produce gifts for us: Fruit. They want the fruit to be eaten so their seeds are spread.  I don't know how you define harm. We breed billions of animals. Germany alone breeds and slaughters almost a billion animals every year.

The whale sharks value to Australian tourism is compared to its value in India is compared to the cost of shark fin soup (does that come from whale sharks?) in Hong Kong.   Then we're given a numeric representation of global annual shark deaths next to a percentage of shark populations on the east coast of the U.S.  I mean, I think the big picture is basically right: let's protect the sharks! But it could lead you to believe all those facts are part of the same narrative, i.e. the whale sharks that boost Australia's tourism industry are the same as the sharks in Hong Kong's shark fin soup are the same sharks suffering a 99% population decline in the U.S. when those are all different things."

Infographics,3br0uh,dooony,3,Wed Jul 1 23:56:18 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of dickheads replying to your post who don't understand how tax works.  The idea is that KW pays for all his expenses, e.g. rent, parties, cars, etc from pre-tax salary by donating the money to the charity (pre-tax donation or tax free, same thing) and paying it from there, calling them charity expenses or fund raising activities. If you're a top-bracket income earner like KW this is a saving of nearly 40% on those expenses.   Secondly it allows you to ""employ"" your friends and family and again, that salary being a cost to the charity therefore only paying the tax rate of that salary (e.g. if you pay your mother $90k she will only pay around 20% tax on that) instead of the ~40% KW would have paid if he just handed over the cash (which she would then have to pay income tax on again anyway).   Many countries have miniature versions of this which allows you to build a small pre-tax fund for meals, incidentals, entertainment etc to allow for business related social events.   Don't make excuses for KW - he is a tax cheat. However it's the government's fault for making this shit legal."

Since its launch, monthly sales numbers of the console have generally been higher than its competitors around the globe. According to the NPD Group, the Wii sold more units in the United States than the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 combined in the first half of 2007.  This lead is even larger in the Japanese market, where it currently leads in total sales (having outsold both consoles by factors of 2:1  to 6:1  nearly every week from its launch to November 2007).  In Australia the Wii broke the record set by the Xbox 360 and became the fastest-selling game console in Australian history.   On September 12, 2007, the Financial Times reported that the Wii had surpassed the Xbox 360 (released a year earlier) and had become market leader in home-console sales for the current generation, based on sales figures from Enterbrain, NPD Group and GfK. This was the first time a Nintendo console led its generation in sales since the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

Infographics,3a46wl,Winslow1132,0,Wed Jun 17 13:58:51 2015 UTC,"So one state's concerns should just override the rest? That goes against the entire purpose of the structure of our government.   Because of the power the executive has already been given, electing the president by popular vote would not be good for our republic regardless of the party elected."
Infographics,3a46wl,topherhead,5,Wed Jun 17 15:59:55 2015 UTC,"Well the electorial college was originally used to filter out candidates that the people in power didn't deem ""worthy"".  That's what happened to Andrew Jackson the first time he won the election.  Now I don't agree that more populous states should override the less populous.  But do you think it's fair that nine states effectively determine every election?  Furthermore, as a Moderate/Democrat in a Republican state I have 0 reason to vote because my vote won't count.  Anyone who argues otherwise is delusional.  I don't think that popular vote should necessarily be how it's done.  I'm not smart or in tune enough with it to really give a truly educated opinion.  My idea is:   Revamp the districts.  Gerrymandering has completely fucked all of them and this is almost certainly not going to happen in a fair way.  But that's something that needs to be done regardless.  The districts would have to be drawn along raw voting population lines (equal number of people for each district) for bullet 3 to work.  This would result in huge districts out in the rural areas while large city areas might have four or five each.  Now this presents a problem, and I can't tell you the solution.  Cities will have more votes than rural areas.  They also represent a larger proportion of the population so I don't know if it's fair that rural votes would count more than theirs.  Maybe a formula that takes into consideration both population density and land area that would divide rural areas into more districts so they get more votes. Instead of having entire states votes go one way.  Have the districts votes count directly.  Instead of California having 55 electoral votes that always go Democrat.  Have them have 55 votes that could go either way.  In effect this would probably yield more of x districts always going one way and y votes always going the other, while z votes swing each election.  where x and y are probably quite a bit larger than z. Electoral votes are obligated to go with the wishes of their district.  For that matter why not remove the middleman and just have each district count as a vote?   This is essentially a popular vote.  But there are many parts of many states that lean the opposite way of the state itself.  Those areas have no voice in the current voting system and this would allow ""states"" to vote either way.  In fact, I would almost argue that more states that always go one way have no voice.  For all their votes, California and Texas don't determine elections.  I don't think there are any easy solutions.  But the current one most definitely is not ideal."
Infographics,3a46wl,Winslow1132,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:42:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure ""having no voice"" and your vote being cancelled out by another person are equivalent. You are free to persuade anyone to come over to your side, regardless of how many people are voting. As an aside, is everyone's voice even worth listening to? Obviously not because none of us listen to everyone for two reasons; (1) you can't; and (2) some ideas are just bad ideas.  Votes are always decided on the margin, that's just how votes work. Reframing normal voting to seem to be taking someone's vote away is clever rhetoric but doesn't change the nature of a vote-based political system. In other words, the effect of your vote is not diminished based on whether your candidate wins by 1 vote or by 1 million votes.   Madison's Federalist 10 is particularly relevant to this issue. In it, Madison explains the checks and balances in the constitutional system that prevent a majority from tyrannizing the rest of the country. The electoral college serves this purpose by moderating the political ambition of the executive. If we had a popular vote for president there would be no incentive for candidates to even bother catering to the other side or to other states. The political climate would become even more polarized than it already is, and once in power the majority party could do whatever they want.   You may favor this because it would give your side more power. But imagine if the people you disagree with had more power, is that something you'd want?"
Infographics,3a46wl,topherhead,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:11:18 2015 UTC,"That's already the case where I live.  Republicans run my state and I disagree pretty strongly with many of their public policies (though I'm more a fiscal republican)  Maybe the solution is something similar to congress.  Have two sets of votes.  One by district that favors population and one that is equal in all states and adds up roughly to the number of populous votes.  in 2012 there were 538 electoral votes so maybe we give each state an additional either 10 or 11 votes.  bringing the total votes to either 1038 or 1088.  Those votes would go to the side that had more districts in that state.  The higher that number the more it would favor small states.    Just out of curiosity I checked to see how that would have affected the 2012 election.  But I don't want to count district votes in 50 states so i decided to just do California and Texas as they're the largest states on each side.  I had trouble finding vote results by district so I'm doing it by county which is unfortunately not as accurate.  Current system 55D/38R  By county:   California - 31D/27R - 53.4%/46.6% - 38.06m Texas - 26D/228R - 10.2%/89.8% - 26.09m   So in this case, California has greater representation, this means D would get 59.1% of the vote.  If we went just by county it clearly wouldn't be fair as Texas just has four times as many counties...  So I'm going to change those percentages to population numbers...  this is going to be very crude..  So say we had each divided into district by population.  California has 1.46 times as many people as Texas so we'll say that California has 146 districts and Texas has 100.  Makes things easier.   California D78/R68 Texas D10/R90   So if we did votes like this then the results would be D88/R158 D35.8%/64.2% so clearly the Republicans would win pretty easily and the current system marginalizes them quite heavily between these two states.  If we added the majority granted votes which would be 123 per states (since we want these to be about equal to the populous vote power) that gives us D211/R281 giving us a new percentage of D42.9%/57.1%.  To me this seems to make things a lot more fair.  It doesn't work super well just between these two states.  But I think over 50 it could prove interesting.  Smaller states get an overall larger percentage while minority voters in each state still get a voice."

I don't think that people are basically good (nor did the founders), nor do I think we are progressing to be basically good, so I think government needs to be designed to restrain us from hurting ourselves.   I think the entirety of human history confirms a generally dim view of people. There are great individuals, but humanity as a whole hasn't been so great.  I would also question your order of power and money in politics. It is the power in government that draws the money like flies to dung, not money that creates the power. If the congress or president didn't have as much power as we've given them (and the courts have given them), then there would be less of a reason to curry the favor of politicians through lobbying and fund raising. Money on its own is just a substitute for other forms of influence such as family ties, friendships, tribal relationships, etc. It's the power that is at the root of the problem."
Infographics,3a46wl,zdf_mass,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:47:40 2015 UTC,"yes, but it is the power of the government that creates businesses in the first place. Markets and companies don't just exist without government, they're extensions of government--they're nothing without it. Therefore, it is nonsense to say that if somehow the government had less power that there wouldn't be corporations involving themselves in government. It isn't a zero sum game when they are always on the same side."
Infographics,3a46wl,Winslow1132,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:21:24 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Markets and businesses are pre-government entities. This is clear from any study of human history or some basic thought experiments. Without any form of government people will trade and create business. If you are better at making things from wood than I am, and I am better at growing plants, its in our mutual best interest to trade. We don't need a government to bless the trade or say it's allowed, we would just do it. Lots of people trading creates a market. Most of our currency today is a fiat currency created by states, but currency in times past was a pre-government form of trade and markets managed that on their own. Markets are a form of spontaneous order and do not require anyone to administer or command things.   That said, the corporate form as a legal matter does require a state and written laws, but that does not mean that business flows from the state.  Also, in a regulatory state we do see bigger businesses aligning themselves with whatever is best for government, but that is mostly because more regulation serves as a barrier to entry for competitors, and larger companies have enough lawyers to play the game."

Actually regarding the split brain myth, it has been confirmed that the two brain parts is responsible for different tasks.   You can read more about if you google split brain surgery. Having brain surgery cutting the cord(unsure if this is the term) connecting the two brain hemispheres used to be a treatment for reducing the impact of epileptic seizure. These patients were then involved in experiments that showed that the hemispheres worked independent of each other.  source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMLzP1VCANo + some articles"

Infographics,3927gs,Gramatike,2,Tue Jun 9 18:53:04 2015 UTC,"Salt water does boil faster, though it has more to do with making the water 'dirty' then the salt itself.   The salt creates more nucleation sites for bubbles to form, the increased circulation of the fluid evens the heating of it as well. Though your not adding any energy to the system with salt, so the overall effect is the boiling action (the bubbles that rise to the top) is achieved sooner and easier, but the transitional temperature is reached at the same time."

You are expected to at the very least try to speak French, to show you are a decent person who do not expect to speak you own language (especially true for English-speaking tourists) outside of your country. Now there is a vast quantity of arseholes in France, and I like to think I am not one of them, and whenever I travel abroad I always strive to learn a few phrases in the local language. I also heard of French people speaking French and nothing else abroad, they're the ones who give us a bad reputation.   In conclusion, if you ever visit France, try to mumble a sentence or two in French and people will be happy to continue the conversation in English, probably with a shite accent."

Its results suggest that certain common indoor plants may provide a natural way of removing toxic agents such as benzene, formaldehyde and trichloroethylene from the air, helping neutralize the effects of sick building syndrome.  The first list of air-filtering plants was compiled by NASA as part of a clean air study published in 1989.    which researched ways to clean air in space stations. As well as absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen, as all plants do, these plants also eliminate significant amounts of benzene, formaldehyde and trichloroethylene. The second and third list are from B. C. Wolverton's book  and paper  and focus on removal of specific chemicals.  NASA researchers suggest efficient air cleaning is accomplished with at least one plant per 100 square feet of home or office space.  Other research has shown that micro-organisms in the potting mix (soil) of a potted plant remove benzene from the air, and that some plant species also contribute to removing benzene.

Infographics,3841cf,viperex,3,Mon Jun 1 20:41:08 2015 UTC,"Let's say a Chinese company wants to make a deal with a Brazilian one.  In the past they would make a contract about how much product is being moved, and what it is worth in dollars etc. So each time a payment is made from one company to the other, the money needs to be changed into dollar from Brazilian Reals and then into Chinese Yuan and vis versa.  In order for the money to be exchanged into dollars, Brazilian and Chinese banks had to hold on to a certain amount of American money (USD) and this makes the U.S. Dollar stronger.  The solution to this problem (In the eyes of China and others). Is that China will promise to hold on to Reals and Brazil will promise to hold on to Yuan for speedy exchange purposes, essentially cutting out the USD middle man and making their contracts in Yuan or Reals.  But in the end, yes you can compare Reals to USD and Yuan to USD in the end anyway, but if you are confident that the Chinese or Brazilian (or fill in the blank country) will experience more economic growth in the near future it will be more profitable to have profits in currencies other than dollars.  So it is a two part equation, betting on other currencies and their performance vs the dollar, and cutting out the USD.  For the U.S. this is all bad because we are losing control of the global economy. China once proposed something to the effect of an international exchange bank, where it would perform currency exchanges for a very minor fee, and every country would contribute to its operating costs. The bank would use ""international dollars"" as a unit of account and be made up of 40% USD, 20% Yuan etc what the world's economy looks like in general. The U.S. didn't like this idea, but if China really starts to hurt them with this deal, the U.S. will likely revisit this proposal."

Terminology of article  Venomous snake:       Venomous snakes are often said to be poisonous, although this is not the correct term since venom and poison are different entities. Poisons are absorbed by the body, such as through skin or the digestive system, while venoms must first be introduced directly into tissues or the bloodstream (envenomated) by mechanical means. It is, for example, harmless to drink snake venom as long as there are no lacerations inside the mouth or digestive tract. The two exceptions are: the Rhabdophis keelback snakes secrete poison from glands they get from the poisonous toads they consume, and similarly, certain garter snakes from Oregon retain toxins in their livers from the newts they eat.

Venoms need to get into the blood to work.   It is more about the purpose of poisons and venoms. Poisons deter predators, venoms are for killing prey.

Infographics,37qpb3,Kaeltan,2,Fri May 29 19:19:05 2015 UTC,"Rattlesnakes are typically decapitated prior to cooking or being eaten.

One of the things that kill battery capacity the fastest is always running down the battery, and even worse, using it constantly while the battery is low. This means letting your phone die or get to that 1-2% stage (especially while pulling lots of energy from it, e.g. by playing games on it) before borrowing a friend's charger, bringing it back up to 15%, using the battery some more, etc.  Also not that great for battery life is always keeping the battery >80% charge. This goes for lots of older folks who keep their phones in their briefcase/purse all day and almost never use it. They get home with 90% battery remaining and then stick it back onto the charger. Let it drain to 30% or so at least once a week before recharging it.  Something else that drains the hell out of your battery is being in a location with weak signal. Your phone pushes the antenna to max strength, which drains battery quickly.  Leaving wifi turned on all day really doesn't do much to battery life since it uses so little power (and uses less power than LTE/4G/3G for data transfer).   Honestly, the other thing that absolutely beats the shit out of your phone's battery is Candy Crush. Not sure why, but I drop 10% of my battery every time I bust it out while on the crapper."

Infographics,36rgps,cosmicr,4,Fri Jun 5 07:37:31 2015 UTC,"What's interesting is Naproxen is marketed in Australia solely as a period pain killer. It's sold as Naprogesic, you rarely see men buy it. Everyone calls me crazy when I tell them it's good for other types of pain too.   Ibuprofen in Australia is mainly marketed at muscle pain, whilst paracetamol (acetaminophen) is marketed at most other types of pain.  There's also diclofenac(Voltaren) which is mainly for muscle and arthritis soreness. Our brands are  Panadol - paracetamol (our most popular pain killer)  Nurofen - ibuprofen  Naprogesic - naproxen  Aspro-clear - aspirin  Voltaren - diclofenac   This table however I don't believe is entirely correct.  As I said previously Naproxen is good for period pain. Aspirin is great for hangovers, especially the disolveable type (Aspro-clear in Aus, Alkaselzter in US), since the water will also help re-hydrate you.  But generally speaking unless you're taking pain medication all the time, any of these non-steroidal anti-inflammatories are good for any type really. We also have ""extra"", ""plus"", and ""forte"" variants on most of these, with either caffeine or codeine added.  If you are taking a lot of pain killers, there's a famous saying in Australia that goes ""if pain persists, please, see your doctor"" lol, but you can get really cheap packets of 100 tablets for like $3 at Chemist Warehouse, as long as you're happy with generic brands.

For example, one needs to consider a patient's underlying health issues. I wouldn't have a person with cirrhosis take APAP and I wouldn't have someone with CKD take ibuprofen, aleve, or aspirin.   You also need to consider other meds the patient is taking. If they were on blood thinners, I would steer them away from nsaids and if they were taking other meds with APAP in them I might steer them towards them.   Another issue is that ibuprofen and naproxen are practically the same drug (in terms of therapeutic indication and side effects) but the chart shows significant favor to ibuprofen. Aspirin is also really similar to them, but only has stroke prevention listed. I typically try to avoid aspirin for typical aches and pains if I can, but if someone really wants it, I'm cool with it. It does a good job at pain relief.   In short, don't trust these things.

ODs tend to either be intentional (seriously people, never do a paracetamol OD, it's not a good way to go) or accidental, meaning they're taking several products (usually cold remedies) that contain paracetamol without realising. Either way they're taking over the max dose.  With NSAIDs, we try to keep at the lowest dose to treat the patient for the shortest period of time due to either the GI side effects or increased risk of cardiovascular problems (people still end up on them long term though and will be given a PPI to protect their stomach). Oral diclofenac (Voltarol) was recently made a prescription only medicine in the UK due to concerns about cardiovascular problems."
Infographics,36rgps,Giloman,8,Fri May 22 10:40:48 2015 UTC,"I'm am a pharmacy graduate (taking my boards in a few weeks). This chart seems very biased. Ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin are all in the same class of drugs called NSAIDs. They are good for pain and inflammatory conditions. Aspirin has a longer acting effect on platelets which is why is is good for preventing strokes, but in healthy patients who only need it for inflammation or pain it is very effective if using the correct dose. Acetaminophen is an excellent pain killer and fever reducer. It has less effect on inflammation (though still some) when compared to any of the NSAIDs. People respond differently to drugs, so use whichever works for you personally. If you follow the dosing instructions on the label, all four are safe. If you haven't tried any of them, I typically recommend acetaminophen first as it is often the cheapest."

Infographics,36rgps,Jazz-Sandwich,1 point,Fri May 22 02:47:24 2015 UTC,"Dentist. Ibuprofen is a cheap generic so I don't think there's any benefit to being bias. I really do think it is superior to a lot of other pain drugs. #1 reason for this is safety. The LD50 is something like 5000mg while acetaminophen is similar (somewhat less actually) it requires over double the effective dose (ed50) to work as well, meaning it's much more dangerous. The effect of acetaminophen on the liver is very bad, and many painkillers contain acetaminophen compounded with a narcotic. Death resulting from acetaminophen is one of the most painful, long and horrific ways to go."
Infographics,36rgps,GreatestScott88,1 point,Thu May 28 00:31:01 2015 UTC,"Valid points, however I am still very much skeptical about the bias of the infographic you said to be '100% accurate'. It suggests a very significant difference between ibuprofen and naproxen, and the relative risks/benefits of acetaminophen, NSAIDs and plain old aspirin are a bit more nuanced.  I would be very much in agreement about the dangers of acetaminophen, particularly given the amount of attempted suicide with the agent, though I would contend that NSAIDs are of underestimated danger given their renal effects. Though with the assumption that a drug is being taken at the recommended dose, I would always advocate acetaminophen first."

Link  In my opinion these batteries would be extremely desirable in situations where the grid is not reliable / can't access the grid and have e.g. solar panels and need to store some of the energy for later use.  I'm living in a city and pay about 13 eurocents/kWh. Past several years, I've lost power maybe three times, each time for less than half an hour.   I wouldn't invest several thousands to get an UPS (uninterrupted power source) for my whole house - too few outages.   And my power company doesn't offer night-rates for small power users like a typical household -> no gains from having ability to charge the battery during the night for cheaper price and then using the last night's charge during the day.  Other places have these kind of price changes (but I think the difference is too little to pay back the battery in any reasonable time)."

(His grandfather owned railroad companies, and his father owned oil companies.) He was already a millionaire at the beginning of the chart.  (That said, he didn't rely upon actual family money directly in building his business. But, coming from a multi-generational line of billionaires who have made their own fortunes has its own perks -- starting with having access to very expensive education and having a family environment where being super-competitive and acting like an asshole to get ahead is both rewarded and seen as an objective good based on several lifetimes' experience.)"

Infographics,35i8k3,ruizscar,7,Mon May 11 00:13:19 2015 UTC,"That last point is not really correct. While computers were rare in the 60s and 70s, there were definitely hackers, and they tended to spend upwards of eighteen hours a day programming.   Keep in mind that UNIX was written and was starting to become popular outside of Bell Labs before Bill Gates graduated high school -- it's absurd to claim that in, say, 1975, Bill Gates had spent more time in front of a computer than Rob Pike, Brian Kerninghan, Ken Thomson, or Dennis Ritchie; and, those were professionals at Bell Labs keeping mostly professional hours.   If you take a look at the earlier era -- people like Slug Russel and Bill Gosper at MIT's TMRC had been spending 10+ hours a day coding since the late 50s, and their group had written ITS, TECO, SpaceWar, and other early icons of the software world long before Bill Gates got into the game.  Now, it's true that Bill Gates started relatively early. But, hey -- Slug Russel started at 12, and was at it for more than a decade before Bill Gates started (he was involved in SpaceWar, and UNIX was written in part as a way of justifying porting SpaceWar to new hardware, all of which happened before Bill Gates got on the scene and started selling BASIC, although I believe his work for the DEC tiger team might have been prior to UNIX taking off outside Bell Labs).  Bill Gates had some technical chops, to be sure (in a way that Steve Jobs, who never learned to code and never really knew much about electronics, never did). But, Gates hardly compared with many of his peers at the time. Gates (and Jobs) succeeded essentially because he was absolutely willing to be a coldhearted asshole and cheat his competitors, at a time when he was surrounded by naiive hippies in an industry that was just beginning to sprout. Such behavior won't necessarily get you ahead in a mature industry (since safeguards tend to develop to punish cheaters or keep them out, and since you tend to need to cultivate a good reputation with established figures), but the hobby-computer industry (which, ten years later, became the ""personal computer"" industry, and ten years after that became almost the entirety of the ""computer industry"" by mostly pushing out IBM's big iron and alternately buying up or putting out of business the rest of the seven dwarves & the minicomputer industry) was brand new, and nobody in it had the kind of attitude and habits it takes to become a robber-baron in an emerging industry except for Gates, whose whole family had spent their childhood being taught to compete tooth and nail over anything that could be quantified.  Bill Gates' technical skill had relatively little to do with anything. (For a comparison, see Steve Jobs, who had no technical skills, and yet was more profitable than Microsoft twice -- once in the late 70s and early 80s with the Apple ][, despite having it run all Microsoft software, and again a decade after being brought back to Apple when he pushed a massively upgraded Newton clone known as the iPhone and launched the smartphone industry while simultaneously killing the PDA industry.) Instead, it was his tendency to be a competitive asshole that allowed him to succeed (a tendency that Jobs also had) combined with a fairly practical attitude. (This practicality is one thing that differs between Gates and Jobs that massively impacts their success patterns. Jobs screwed himself over pushing the Lisa, then the original Mac, then all of NeXT, because he was impractical and was overselling machines that tried to do things that they couldn't do, and thus were expensive failures. Gates screwed himself over by being too practical, and being the cultural figurehead that led his companty to deem incredibly flawed systems good enough to ship -- which lost Microsoft market share to Apple as soon as Macs began to be usable in the mid-80s, and lost Microsoft market share to relatively low-prominence competitors like Amiga, Be, and Linux throughout the 90s, before losing server market share almost entirely to free unixes around the turn of the century.)"

However, the CDC has reported that there have been no cases of polio in India since 2011, compared to the 741 case in 2009. The paralysis cases were identified as non polio Acute Flaccid Paralysis, which can result from any number of non-polio viruses or bacterium. In this case, non-polio enteroviruses were identified as the cause, and not polio that resulted from the vaccines themselves. In fact, as I discussed before, polio vaccines may spontaneously recombine in the wild, and can be transmitted to other humans. However, in India with a population of 1.2 billion people, there have only been a few cases of actual polio from recombination events. If it were widespread, we’d see millions of cases, but we don’t.

Infographics,351ak8,JonStowe1,6,Wed May 6 11:10:36 2015 UTC,A skyscraper is over 200meters.
Infographics,351ak8,Eudaimonics,2,Wed May 6 12:44:06 2015 UTC,"That definition will vary.  According to wikipedia a skyscraper is any building over 150m.  ""Supertall"" skyscrapers are over 300m.  ""Megatall"" skyscrapers are over 600m."
Infographics,351ak8,autowikibot,1 point,Wed May 6 16:49:48 2015 UTC,"Skyscraper:       A skyscraper is a tall, continuously habitable building of over 40-50 floors, mostly designed for office, commercial and residential use. A skyscraper can also be called a high-rise, but the term skyscraper is often used for buildings higher than 150 m (492 ft). For buildings above a height of 300 m (984 ft), the term Supertall can be used, while skyscrapers reaching beyond 600 m (1,969 ft) are classified as Megatall.   One common feature of skyscrapers is having a steel framework that supports curtain walls. These curtain walls either bear on the framework below or are suspended from the framework above, rather than load-bearing walls of conventional construction. Some early skyscrapers have a steel frame that enables the construction of load-bearing walls taller than of those made of reinforced concrete. Modern skyscrapers' walls are not load-bearing and most skyscrapers are characterized by large surface areas of windows made possible by the concept of steel frame and curtain walls. However, skyscrapers can have curtain walls that mimic conventional walls and a small surface area of windows. Modern skyscrapers often have a tubular structure, and are designed to act like a hollow cylinder to resist lateral loads (wind, seismic, etc.). To appear more slender, allow less wind exposure and to transmit more daylight to the ground, many skyscrapers have a design with setbacks.

How is this discovery useful and shouldn't it be obvious that this would happen even at the quantum level?"
Infographics,34ud52,Jeppa1997,4,Mon May 4 19:08:58 2015 UTC,"See, your analogy is for quantum physics in general.  A better analogy for this would be that you have the two balls in their respective boxes.  Send one to California and keep one in NYC.  You guys both open the boxes and see which ball you have and that's cool.  Now you notice that if you spin one ball counterclockwise, the other, many many miles away, spins clockwise with a response time of 10,000 times the speed of light (pretty much instantaneous in the layman sense of the word).  Then you stop one and the other instantly stops as well.    What these guys want to do is figure out how these two balls are connected such that they make each other move like they do.  Sure, they're entangled at the quantum level, but over the span of a tremendous distance with no lag in response time whatsoever?  Gets me all tingly just thinking about it haha"

Infographics,34ud52,reflector8,8,Mon May 4 19:22:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is somewhat misleading. Your explanation makes it sound as if we can 'select' a spin for one photon, thus 'instantly' deciding the spin for the other far off photon. But we can't. We can only observe the photon's spin. And, importantly, until we do we have no way of knowing what that spin will be. In order to use this as some sort of communication device we would need to be able to predict or pre-arrange the spin for certain entangled photons. Currently we can't do this and, based on what little I know about the subject, it's unlikely such a thing is possible.  So the crazy thing here is that it seems the entangled photons are 'talking' to each other over long distances almost instantaneously. That truly is bizarre. But there is no known way for us to use this to send information."
Infographics,34ud52,Dioskilos,1 point,Mon May 4 23:02:26 2015 UTC,"You are right that it is misleading in that the analogy doesn't hold up. But isnt the point that one has an affect on the other somehow? Not just a matter of ""if you know one state, you can infer the other's state"" posed by the original analogy?"
Infographics,34ud52,reflector8,5,Tue May 5 01:04:32 2015 UTC,But is this really the case? I thought information couldn't travel faster than the speed of light. My understanding is that they get decoupled after being observed and therefore no longer effect each other.
Infographics,34ud52,Jeppa1997,2,Mon May 4 20:08:06 2015 UTC,"is this really the case?   Yes, and you are correct that no physical particle can move faster than the speed of light. That's partly why this is so interesting. Scientists don't know how it's able to break the speed of light. It's likely not a particle moving in between the two telling one to change. This is one of those great mysteries of science."
Infographics,34ud52,BigSwedenMan,1 point,Tue May 5 07:40:54 2015 UTC,But doesn't the particle implicitly know the state of the other as soon as it is created? We can't know what state it is in before measuring it but just because the information about its' spin is unknown to us doesn't mean that it is doesn't exist. I'm assuming that the particles must have a definitive spin and we just say that it's in a superposition because we can't tell which one it is in before measuring. Is this true or is my assumption incorrect?
Infographics,34ud52,Jeppa1997,1 point,Tue May 5 10:40:40 2015 UTC,"Your assumption, while logical, is incorrect.

Infographics,34ud52,BigSwedenMan,1 point,Tue May 5 10:47:23 2015 UTC,"So if they are still entangled after they have been observed is it then possible to create a ""morse-like"" signal between the two different particles?

This, of course, means there may never be. The 'observation' just makes one photon take on a spin state, leading the other one to take on a linked spin state. We can't choose which spin state the observed photon can take, nor can we predict it. Therefore we can't actually transfer information with this process. of course, as you say, who knows what future discoveries will reveal."

The problem is the spin is random. If A takes the UP state, then B will take the DOWN state. But we don't currently have any way of choosing what state A takes, it's basically random. That means right now at best we can generate random data on one side, and record opposite but still random data from B. That alone doesn't really pass any information along.  It's a little more complicated than that as well, but I hope that helps. It may be possible in the future to figure out how to set a particular state, but we have no indication right now leading us to think it's possible."

Einstein is famously quoted as saying ""God does not play dice with the universe"" as a way to explain his stance on the seemingly random outcome of things like quantum measurements, which brings us back here.  He believed in a deterministic universe (God, not to be confused with the religious concept, is a term he used to communicate the underpinnings of reality).  If negative energy, or perhaps negative energy density, could exist in some form them it should be possible to build and stabilize certain types of wormholes.  If some theories I don't understand yet regarding the nature of the quantum vacuum are true, then it may be possible to use normal matter to act as negative energy.

It's misleading of Vox to compare these rates to the % of the total US population. What we really want to know is how the Black population killed by police during arrests compares to their share of arrests/crimes committed. As we see, the Black population (seemingly) commits more crimes than what is representative for their population.   Based on the violent crime arrest rate (38.5%), these other rates are not too far off. However, I'm sure many of these killings happen during property crimes (29.3%), in which case the Black population is still killed during arrest at a higher rate. However, it's not nearly as drastic as looking at the US population overall would suggest (13% Black)."

But, regardless of the actual numbers, the statistics you quote here are certainly not enough to reach any conclusion. What makes you think that more black people commit crimes instead of cops arrest more black people? What makes you think that the crimes are actually more likely to be committed by black people? This statistic could easily mean that cops are more likely to arrest black people. This is correlation vs causation. We have no idea what causes the relationship in these stats.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQdMgtncpoE  You cannot assume that arrest rate= actual crime rate.

I agree with you that you cannot make that conclusion and there is no causation.   However, even if you assume that 50% of Black violent crime arrests are false due to bias/racism, that still means Blacks are arrested for 19.5% of violent crimes, which is still 50% greater than their representation in the US population (13%).  So, while I agree with you that there is no conclusive evidence here, my point was that I don't think it is a huge leap of logic to infer that Black people do, in fact, commit violent crimes at a greater rate. I don't think the reason is because they are Black, but it has to do with socioeconomic factors that affect the Black population greater than the White population."

People can choose to wear such stigmas   Can people un-choose them? Can you choose be agnostic to them? Is the answer to racism as simple as everyone choosing the same stigma?   I'll be the first to admit that the wikipedia article on race (which, coincidentally, I re-read a few days ago) went over my head again. It seems as if some academics are trying really hard to invalidate the concept of race via semantics. I was constantly reminded of this old chestnut:   ""Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.""   In the wiki article on race, these was proportionately scant mention of medicines that work well for certain ""races"", or that, broadly speaking, people of different ""races"" have markedly different phenotypes, among other things. The focus seemed to be on the fact that there is no such thing as race - which I guess is the consensus of academics. However, the reasoning seemed suspiciously convoluted for such a seemingly obvious concept. Like I said, I really didn't get it, and couldn't sum it up in a sentence or two."

I can assure you that the only professional academicians that sit around and publish research on semantics are the semanticists. In physics we use special definitions of common words, such as ""work"" and ""energy,"" which have little to do with employment and vocations, as such definitions are often defined using mathematics.  In biology, there is a very specific definition of what constitutes as ""life,"" but this definition has changed over the years and is still debated.  Nonetheless, when there is any ambiguity about the definition of ""life"" in a specific research paper, a particular wording will be chosen for the extent of that research paper.   ...I guess my point is that I don't see how or why academia asserts that there is no such thing as race when its seemingly apparent that its pretty clear there is. Sorta, kinda, cant elaborate now.     Here is a historical image that I like to share, which shows just how radically the central concepts of race have changed over time.  During the Irish potato famine and diaspora, Irish immigrants were segregated and discriminated against, and arguments were made to explain away ethnic disparities as being the fault and failings of the Irish.  Much as with blacks, race was used to justify racial superiority over the Irish, and some even classified them as being more closely related to Africans than to Europeans.    Most of the racial terminology that was once used has since become obsolete language, and even the definition of ""negro"" varied drastically amongst different academicians who were contemporaries of each other.  One such subcategory, the quadroon, was fundamental to the one-drop rule of racial classification in the US."

That we can even argue about the statistical relevance of this infograph sort of overlooks the fact that we have enough statistical data to debate the validity of particular analytical methods.     We could easily examine each and every individual person killed by a cop, and consider the entirety of the circumstances surrounding their life and death, but at best all we get is the biased account of a potential murderer embedded within an institution with a track record of promoting, condoning, and covering up murder at an increasing rate.    All the people murdered by cops during an arrest, were necessarily killed without a trial and conviction.  This bickering we see here is the extent of due process given to these dead people.    We give the benefit of the doubt to an institution that does not deserve it, and we take it away from an ethnic community that has been historically oppressed in our culture.

Otherwise, you're basing all labor dynamics on 'who wants it more'.   The evidence is in the graph... now im not denying or supporting its accuracy, all im claiming is that IF it is accurate, then the numbers supporting a 6%-9% unemployment rate is not a ""failure""  Their are jobs out there, I know of places that you can get hired today and make $70k a year... no previous experience required.

Infographics,33x42h,Stacksup,7,Sun Apr 26 16:31:23 2015 UTC,"The last two battleships - the USS Iowa and the USS Wisconsin - were retired in 2006. One of them was kept in reserve until 2010. The US was the last country to finally decommission their last battleships, so now there are no more active duty battleships anywhere in the world. Kind of an ""end of an era"" type of deal.   Even when battleships were at their ""peak"" they were mostly useless in terms of actual combat and had more of a symbolic purpose. They were huge and well armed, but also expensive and very vulnerable to stupidly simple things like torpedoes and mines."
Infographics,33x42h,1speedbike,9,Sun Apr 26 18:46:26 2015 UTC,Whats the difference between a battleship and a distroyer or a frigate?
Infographics,33x42h,I_am_bovo,8,Sun Apr 26 19:41:35 2015 UTC,"The most obvious is size. Battleships are huge, have more armor (but this ended up counting for little against torpedoes, and later, missiles), and way more crew.  In terms of armaments/guns, battleships focused on huge weapons to take out heavily armored or large targets. They would shell large enemy ships, or bombard enemies on the shore.  Destroyers have smaller armaments with shorter range. This difference is reflected in their jobs/roles. While battleships attacked large targets, destroyers were originally developed to protect the battleships and other large ships from smaller boats and torpedoes. They formed ""screens"" around them in order to protect the big ships from other boats, submarines, and later on, aircraft.   Because of the increased prevalence of planes and longer range missiles, battleships weren't built after WW2 any more because they became easy targets, while faster and more maneuverable (and less expensive) destroyers still made sense."
Infographics,33x42h,1speedbike,2,Sun Apr 26 20:38:41 2015 UTC,"HMS Vanguard (23):       HMS *Vanguard_ was a British fast battleship built during World War II and commissioned after the war. She was the only ship of her class and was the biggest, fastest and last of the Royal Navy's battleships,  and the final battleship to be launched in the world. Work on the ship's design commenced before the war because the Royal Navy anticipated being outnumbered by the combined German and Japanese battleships in the early 1940s. The British had enough 15-inch (380 mm) guns and turrets in storage to allow one ship of a modified Lion-class battleship design to be completed faster than the ships of that class that had already been laid down. Work on Vanguard was started and stopped several times during the war and even after construction had begun, her design was revised several times to reflect war experience. These stoppages and changes prevented her from being completed during the war.

They use dcps (www.torontodcp.com) also DVD sales are pretty much no longer a part of the market and have been replaced by video on demand and television distro. Also edison copied the Lumiere brothers and claimed he invented the motion picture camera amongst other things. To answer the box office question, the fees have to do with presales. Most big films are pre sold to theatre chains before they even start to make revenue from the box office, some even recouping their production budget on this. This and marketing budgets are usually never disclosed to the public."

""Working intelligence"" is merely about how quickly they respond when learning commands, and fails to take in so many extant factors like energy levels and stubbornness of a breed. While a given breed may have low working intelligence, they can still be quite intelligent overall, and I'd say ""dumb"" and ""clever"" are wildly inaccurate labels for either side of the spectrum on this.   Not saying Afghan Hounds are overall a smart breed or that Border Collies aren't indisputably the quantum physicists of the canine world, but I found that label on this chart poorly executed, despite most metrics looking fine (except the weird formula for scores, which for some reason lists ailments as an addable trait, unless they score in reverse and weight this based on how few the breed is genetically prone to)."

As far as efficiency goes, either you are making a standalone point that it is inefficient, in which case I would respond by saying that there is no truly efficient health care system (or really any economic system for that matter), merely varying degrees of efficiency.

Infographics,3306ni,CaptainEarlobe,1 point,Sat Apr 18 13:19:40 2015 UTC,"Predominantly, yet the majority of redditors aren't American. And the origin of the website or even the internet itself is hardly relevant. Besides, Americans do it all the time on non-American sites.   The fact of the matter is that most non-Americans have the common courtesy to actually add some context to their post. As an Irish person, I don't say ""The North-East is very cold this time of year"" (outside of /r/Ireland) because I know that no one will know where I'm talking about, so I say ""The North-East of Ireland"". But Americans routinely add no context to their posts. I know that for most Americans, such as the OP, it's inadvertent, but it's still frustrating.  And americentrism is not limited to the internet either. American tourists in Ireland consistently talk about the US as if everyone in Ireland is educated in American history and geography. Having worked in retail, I've had Americans ask me prices in dollars and a friend of mine have even had an experience where an American tried to pay in dollars. This never happens with non-Americans  I also personally know many Americans who are convinced that the US is the best country in the world. I'm sure every American knows other Americans who think the same. Again, Americans are the only people I've met who think that their country is the best.  There was even a recent Askreddit post talking about what America has done right. Most of the replies were legitimate, the quality of the US' national parks was a great example, another great example was how the US makes the best movies, TV shows and video games. But there were also some top posts that talked about how great American Democracy is ,even though academics in Princeton call it more of an oligarchy, the electoral college is a broken system that got someone with fewer votes elected, and it still uses an antiquated voting system called first past the post as opposed to more efficient proportional representation voting systems). There was also another post talking about how the quality of the US's freedom of speech and public freedom was unrivaled, even though the US rates in the 40s in the world behind developing states such as Namibia, Jamaica and Costa Rica. Lastly, there was a post that mentioned the US could take over the world and chooses not to. That comment was completely ignorant of the fact that the US routinely invades or undermines countries on false pretences solely for American interests, in some cases those are democratically elected states. Also, given how the failures in Iraq, Vietnam and Afghanistan, I highly doubt that the US could take over the world, short of nuking it into oblivion, but that would get the US nuked too, so it would be less world domination and more of a stalemate.  Look, I'm not your stereotypical American hating European, I have nothing against Americans. In fact most of my best friends are Americans and I tend to get along with Americans more than with any other culture outside of my own. But it's still frustrating when a large proportion of posts on Reddit treat the US as the default country, because in doing so it makes every other country out to be just a side character in the narrative of the USA."

Sure cars come in different colors and buyers would prefer one color over another. But, the reality is that there is an illusion of choice.  When a buyer attempts to buy a car, at no point are they offered the choice of their color (or really, any feature) independent of other desirable features. They have to buy what is present on the car lot. And, what is present on the lot is pre-packaged with certain optional features and specified price. These two conditions are the primary conditions and color is incidental to them.  While I didn't read the report, the conclusion that white is the most popular color is likely skewed by the fact that most fleet vehicle are produced in white. Although this is a choice of the buyers (fleet managers), it may not be relevant to apply the motivations of fleet managers to the choices of individual buyers.  tl;dr - I would prefer my car is green but it doesn't come in green. My next choice would be black but the car lot didn't have this model in black. Out of the cars they had on the lot, only one had the feature package I could afford. And, that's why I drive a pink car."

Infographics,32d1ww,BaconOP,2,Mon Apr 13 04:13:46 2015 UTC,"I wonder if there is a chart that shows how likely you are to get lung cancer after x amount of time smoking. Regardless of if you are currently a smoker or not. Sounds pretty depressing, but yeah."

Infographics,32d1ww,illtill8614,3,Mon Apr 13 12:50:14 2015 UTC,"If you've smoked let's say 10 years, the damage is done, but you can stop the progression by quitting. The severity of lung damage is directly correlated with the amount of of cigs/day and the time you've smoked. It's obvious you should quit immediately regardless of how many cigs/day or how many years you've been smoking. Now, for the lung cancer risk, that's another tale. You can smoke for a couple of years and get cancer, or your whole life and not get it. But still, your chances are more grim the more you smoke. Consider I'm only talking about cancer and COPD, and not about other systemic consequences. Edit: typos and redaction"
Infographics,32d1ww,BaconOP,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:38:01 2015 UTC,"I want to add a few things I learned that caused me to quit smoking. The problem is that smoking does not create cancer in your body but greatly augments your chances of getting cancer. Even the American Cancer Society (who has been fighting cigarette smoking in general for longer than almost anyone) can't even make the claim that smoking causes cancer. Their site states that smoking greatly increases your risk of cancer. The truth is if you dig around on the ACS's website for long enough you see that there is no real definable way to say who will have cancer and who won't. There are so many factors and it is so hit-and-miss we can only really say what will increase your risk. Smoking creates an environment for cancer in your body to thrive, it does not actually create cancer cells in your body.   I think what /u/BaconOP is talking about is not that you shouldn't stop smoking, but that certain health problems smoking creates or helps along are irreversible. The best example of an irreversible medical condition that smoking causes is emphysema. If you contract emphysema from smoking your doctor won't say, ""well, you got it so smoke up! There is no hope for you!"" He will tell you to quit, as smoking can further your condition and cause you to contract other medical problems. Plus, there are diseases that smoking can actually cause you to contract like oral thrush. There are many other issues that you immediately see or feel, or take a long time to surface if not looked for like cancer.   The real point is quitting right now stops the issues from progressing, or at the very least progressing as rapidly as they would if you were to keep smoking. I smoked a pack a day for a couple years and I know the damage has been done all over, it’s not as bad as most because I am still fairly young but there has been irreversible damage regardless. I still quit, because your body can repair the other things and the things it cannot your body is resilient enough to power through or ignore."

Infographics,32d1ww,BaconOP,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:15:17 2015 UTC,"ok yeah, makes sense. see, i was told that it will take 5-10 years after i quit (having smoked for 10 yrs or so, pack a day or less) for my body to really start feeling positive internal effects. my sense of smell/taste, general health (no shortness of breath, easier to exercise etc), and even my mind state have improved considerably in quitting the last 4 months. but all of those attributes are relatively superficial compared to what is actually going on in my lungs. meaning that, even though i might be feeling better on the surface; my body make take years to catch back up, and just because i quit doesn't mean a magic switch flipped somewhere that makes me immune to adverse health effects of smoking  thanks for the reply"
