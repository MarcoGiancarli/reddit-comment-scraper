Making them run well with less than qualified operators is why I drink. The one I'm working on right now is 5mm long, 1mm wide turn od, flattened to 0.5mm with four 0.5mm holes in it that need a perfect corner radius for blend. It has tolerances of 0.001"" and currently needs serious thought when ejecting the parts as any cracks we will lose parts. Having to overnight basically every tiny pilot corner rounder that harvey and so on has for this to run tomorrow. The parts bin mesh is perforated with holes already too big so I just got done fabricating a different bin system to hopefully contain the parts that get ejected without losing any from them blasting each other out / falling through tiny holes for coolant drainage. Needless to say, anyone with experience with this knows the headaches this can be. Everything has to be perfect and needs to run not just the first time I set it up but when the setup guys set  it up as well."

Machinists,3e3gxb,comach2,3,Tue Jul 21 19:21:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just multiply by a conversion ratio. However, getting an accurate measurement then starts to assume the corner of the countersink is sharp. Which is probably an OK, no great, assumption."
Machinists,3e3gxb,EvanDaniel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:23:16 2015 UTC,"What am I missing? If you stick a c'sink gage with an 82 degree included angle into a 100 degree c'sink, the tool will touch at the intersection of the c'sink and hole rather than at the intersection of c'sink and surface.  If you knew for certain that the c'sink was exactly x angle and the precise diameter of the hole and that the intersection was crisp, you could probably calculate the c'sink diameter but that sure sounds like way too much work for more than one hole.  If you were to do something like that, I'd start with a 120 degree gauge. It would at least contact the right point for 82, 100, and 120 degree c'sinks."

Machinists,3dzzd4,HipsterGalt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:39:11 2015 UTC,Or even know of a place where i could write out a cnc program and send it to them to be made.    I'm willing to guess this is the least likely outcome. A problem in your drawing can be discovered when we make your program; a problem in your program could do anything from scrap parts to break inserts... tools... motors... machines... people...  I closely examine program edits made by people with 6-36 months experience. I'll never run a program someone I don't know gives me.  Where exactly are you located? I'm presuming it would be pretty easy to make (no real tight tolerances or peculiar shapes) and that most machinists with access to a machine could program/peel them off pretty quick.
Machinists,3dzzd4,ReliablyFinicky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:04:48 2015 UTC,Might want to specify location and see if a fellow user can help you out.

Machinists,3dyzfc,MasterMachinist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:57:05 2015 UTC,That sounds similar to railroad track and I recall those are hot forged to shape due to the difficulties machining it because of the high manganese content.  Can you grind it off instead? You could probably find a Blanchard table local to you that could do it without a considerable tooling investment.  If that won't work you're probably looking at some kind of ceramic insert.

Machinists,3dyzfc,AnIndustrialEngineer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:30:48 2015 UTC,"First thing I would try to face that material that hard would be a low lead angle tool like a Sandvik Coromill 210 if the surface/machine can handle a larger indexable cutter or a 316-xxHM...C if it's under about 2in. wide or if you need better surface finish than the 210 would give. Be sure to use the coolant-thru tools with the C in the product code. I know the solid 316HM tools will perform very well at 850sfm in 50HRc 4340. I would cut the speed back some for harder material. I don't know how much scale your material has but I imagine there's some considering it's hot rolled. That's going to negatively impact tool life for anything you pick.  For work hardening, the prescription is always more chipload. Sometimes this requires using a coarser pitch cutter to keep the spindle power consumption and axis loads manageable."
Machinists,3dzbfw,dbreidsbmw,4,Mon Jul 20 19:21:01 2015 UTC,It seems like it's pretty cut and dry. They just found someone else who met their qualifications and they were comfortable with hiring. Luck of the draw sometimes. It doesn't sound like it was anything personal.

Machinists,3dzbfw,OminousHum,2,Mon Jul 20 19:48:36 2015 UTC,Ensure resume caters to the job you are applying for. For our trade experience in what the posting asks for goes a long way.  It's always better to talk in person for interviews and dropping off resumes. It's just plain competitive. You need to make sure you stand out above someone else with equal or more experience. Usually a person can land a job just by being able to talk. But keeping the job is where your knowledge shines.

Machinists,3dzbfw,Hazzert,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:04:33 2015 UTC,What exactly was the job description?   If it was a programmer position I think you're going to run into this issue a lot without relevant work experience to back it up. Very few companies are going to turn you loose on a 3axis VMC let alone a 5 axis machine without some degree of confidence in your abilities.   I don't think your approach was wrong at all; candidates 1 or 2 probably just had the track record to back up their claims. Good luck in your search!

Machinists,3dsy4u,yournotthebank,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:59:14 2015 UTC,"It is an air bubble, I soaked it in liquid wrench. Down in that slot in the pin is a key. It's holding the pin in.

Machinists,3dsy4u,kv-2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:47:54 2015 UTC,"I would try sharpening a chisel or a punch in such a way that you could try tapping the key laterally in the groove. It went in there somehow so I'm sure it has a way of being removed. Failing that you could always try flipping the part over and beating the pin out, so long as the key is soft enough to shear and not destroy the workpiece. Good luck."
Machinists,3dsy4u,yournotthebank,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:49:19 2015 UTC,I wonder if they put a bent key in and flattened it out? The key in the schematic looks that way. I have never encountered a key and pin like this.

Safety guards had been taken off all the machinery  An employer has a basic responsibility to facilitate a safe work environment. If he was willing to remove machine guards, then it is difficult to really say what else he has done, however he has proven a general disregard for basic safety procedures., and in fact if you read the article they admit as much, stating:    His son, Akbar, 35, who worked as a supervisor at the firm, also admitted breaking health and safety legislation and was given a four month jail sentence, suspended for a year and a Â£3,000 fine.   as well as:   The court heard it was the practice at Hussain's firm for young apprentices to clean the lathes, used to cut and make steel components, with emery paper while the machinery was still running.

When you have 10 skilled operators in the vicinity of an apprentice his every mistake will be pointed out and he will get into the habit of doing things the right way.

Machinists,3dqgj2,BlinginLike3p0,11,Sat Jul 18 14:57:10 2015 UTC,is it possible they mean he was cleaning the workpiece? Cleaning a lathe while it's running sounds utterly insane to me.

Machinists,3dqgj2,BlinginLike3p0,5,Sat Jul 18 18:34:30 2015 UTC,"the trouble with this article is that it was clearly written by someone who has no idea what a lathe is, or maybe a very basic understanding of what one is.  i think thats where the discrepancy is.  i believe he was cleaning the workpiece. someone told the writer that and they assumed that workpiece was part of the machine.  at least that's what i think"
Machinists,3dqgj2,Irahs,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:03:34 2015 UTC,"Well when if he was cleaning it while it was running, how could any sort of guard been used?"
Machinists,3dqgj2,APINTOFBITTAH,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:36:17 2015 UTC,Some lathes have sliding guards that get between you and the chuck. It's not a full enclosure but it's something that keeps you from getting too close while still allowing you to see the workpiece. Could the kid have done his job with the guard in place? Probably not. But maybe that's the point?
Machinists,3dqgj2,TheArtOfSelfDefense,2,Sat Jul 18 15:48:48 2015 UTC,"What are safety guards?   Oh come on, lets be for real. Nobody would pass a complete OSHA audit. We're pretty good but on machines, we disable door/tool changer door safetys due to needing to see whats going on when its running. As for the lathe in this story I'm guessing the safety was mostly common sense. It probably is a large lathe, anything loose that you get caught will end in a bad ride. You can't fix stupid and maybe should rethink having a 16 year old running this type of machine. It sucks to say now, but nobody ever told me that machines dials can come loose preventing you from slowing the rapid down when you're using your finger as a gage to tell how far the tool is from the stock. I have nine fingers. I learned to keep the dial's set screws tight :P but not to stop using my fingers as gages."
Machinists,3dqgj2,pm_your_ip4lulz,3,Sat Jul 18 19:06:42 2015 UTC,You use your fingers as gauges? .. Why not just take the toolpost close to the job then slide the tool against the work piece and tighten? The way some people work is frightening.
Machinists,3dqgj2,Martian-Marvin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:22:28 2015 UTC,"Where were you when I was learning? :P Either way, it wasn't a stick tool so that wouldn't work. Yes I could use a brass shim but didn't have one nearby and was rushing. I'm safe don't worry, I just made a mistake. One in probably a million touch offs, things happen. I get this view that most people here are operators that run one machine all day everyday, where I run multiple mills, lathes, swiss, wire edm, video cmm, laser and manage our IT network. Setup and programming done solely by me, myself and myself. This determinately isn't my first mistake haha."

The article clearly said that the company had 16 year old apprentices doing that kind of work without a modicum of training or supervision. What did they think was going to happen? It seems like common sense that you have to be careful when working around heavy machinery, but a 16 year old kid doesn't have that kind of perspective--especially if they're untrained and their first employer just turned them loose in the shop as if there were nothing to worry about.   Yes, there is an inherent danger in operating and working around machine tools, and yes, if you work around them long enough you'll probably see some close calls. What happened here goes way beyond that though; by taking on apprentices, the employer had a responsibility to actually teach them something, and what happened here appears to be due to an egregious failure on that front."

By rotating the dye during extrusion they can make rods with spiral channels inside, then grind it down to a bit."

Then I'd find the largest rod that would fit thru the bore and cap the end of it with a little piece of brass.  Flip her around and bang the rod against the tang up thru the bore and see it it knocks it loose.   If it doesn't you might need to get out the smoke wrench.

I would try this..... open a vise to where you can slide the quill through but NOT the fat side of that chuck. Then holding the quill, from the underside of the vise.. raise the (chuck + quill) assembly up and pull it down hard like a slide hammer. I would imagine the force behind the chuck will release the taper inside the quill which is in your hand."

My shop orders from McMaster Carr, which for us is expensive but delivers next day, and by their price, and a rough guess that your part is approx 5/8"" x 1"" x 4-5"", material will cost about $50.   But o1 might be a bit overkill for a wood lathe. If you use a bigger piece of 6061 aluminum (3/4"" x 1 1/2"" x 6"") it will run you about $10 in material.   But measure your part. I'd take a scale and measure it as if it were a solid rectangle. That'll give you a rough idea on material size."

Machinists,3dj9fz,herbhemphuffer,2,Fri Jul 17 00:02:26 2015 UTC,I was told your not suppose to hold a end mill in a drill chuck to do any kind of milling with. Don't think they are designed to take side loads or something like that. Also the harden jaws in a drill chuck will wear faster tightening against hard carbide bits. They work better tightening against the softer drill bit shanks. I use a albrecht chuck which is similar to the one the OP is using. To expensive of a chuck to damage if true.  I'll stick to using ER collets and end mill holders instead for carbide.

Keep an eye on those inside sharp corners!  If a part has aligned features on 3 sides or more, scrap rate goes up quite a bit. Is there a way to design around it?  Yes, you have to make a drawing. No, I won't promise it'll be right from just the CAD model. Especially tapped holes!  Every now and then, think about how maliciously wrong someone could make your part and have it still measure out right. Prints convey design intent, models convey the shape of the part.

The corners have smaller radii. The enclosure is a box about 6"" square by 3.5"" deep. Corners are .25"" radii and there are some bosses on the bottom of the box.

You want feedback and are open to change. That's the main thing. But, at the same time don't take any shit. You don't want to be a doormat either. It's a process and you want to improve it.

Machinists,3dglxz,DutchCaptaine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:51:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Not my car, not sure why he did it... I would assume it probably would help with airflow to the radiator (intercooler is a top mount, gets air via the hood scoop). Also, I think one of the main reasons was when you remove the license plate without the relocation, it leaves an ugly recessed area (the place my plate now covers). The relocation bracket, however, can be removed without leaving any unwanted emptiness... which leads to a cleaner look I guess."

I was machining 4ft long extrusions on both ends(and some other features).  I had machined like 6 pieces without incident, then I loaded a piece that was cut like 3/4"" too long so when the cutter went to the other end to machine off the remainder the cutter ripped the part out of one vise but stayed in the opposite vise.  The part was bouncing off the cutter like a bouncy ball, breaking an insert every time it made contact, scrapped the part, even lifted the the vise off the table by breaking the head of a bolt if my memory serves me right.  So rather than have to measure every part before I loaded it, I just added extra passes.  They needed a longer cycle time anyway ;)"

Machinists,3dbtrh,wzcx,2,Wed Jul 15 02:20:02 2015 UTC,"Actually I have no idea how much that EDM is worth. It's a mitsubishi EDM from 1999, and while I'm sure it sold for a lot more than that then I doubt that model is worth more than $50k today.

Machinists,3dbtrh,TheRedditMachinist,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:44:07 2015 UTC,Why can't it burn carbide?  I think all you need is a special electrode right?  Tungsten me thinks. I got an end mill stuck and they used a tungsten tig welding electrode to burn it out.
Machinists,3dbtrh,BiggRanger,3,Wed Jul 15 02:57:57 2015 UTC,"Tungsten-carbide requires a different kind of pulse generator to burn successfully - this machine isn't equipped with it. I think it was a factory option on this model, but it wasn't purchased new and a refit would be a big chunk of what a new EDM would cost.  We use copper-tungsten (CuW) electrodes to burn carbide dies. I think it's possible to use a lot of other materials for electrodes with different settings but the wear rate and overburn amounts would be very different. Horrible electrode wear doesn't matter if you're just burning out taps or endmills, but it sure does if you're trying to run production."

Machinists,3dcfa8,Nekurok,2,Thu Jul 16 00:18:30 2015 UTC,I would use the coarsest thread possible to make things easier. I'd machine a spacer from something softer than the rest so that if it's to be taken apart often it wears out before the part and is replaceable. Machine the spacer a little wider than needed and hand fit it to the part until they align correctly. If it's more than just a one off part have a selection of spacers and choose the correct width by measuring the angular error first.

Machinists,3dafpk,_TurboPanda_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:23:44 2015 UTC,"My first comment here too.  Magnetic switches (specifically reed switches) are generally the same as a momentary push-button in terms of wiring.  Two terminals, make or break (based on switch model) when magnet is within range.  The other type of magnetic switch is Hall effect, but the electronics would be a bit more complicated.  The nice thing about a magnetic switch over a button is that you can dual purpose the magnet as a latch to keep the box closed.  A push button doesn't work well with a horizontal pivot anyway.  The downside is you'd have to work a magnet into your top and that might not be aesthetically pleasing; maybe hidden enough with a horizontal pivot though  I'll leave the machining advise to the experts... but you might want to tell them what material you plan on using.  Anyway, it's a cute design."

Use a shoulder screw. Small and short as possible, you can get them down to 3/32 dia x 1/16 long. Drill thru a into B/C/D. C'bore A for the head and rill to clear the shoulder screw, tap into B/C/D. Or use a poor mans shoulder screw, any screw just not tightened all the way. Remember the hole in A is clearance and stil counterbored. A should then just swivel.  ""RGB cycling leds that I plan on placing in the space between the walls of [C] and [D]"" Don't you mean in between B and D ? I'd put them in perhaps 3 corners of D facing up towards and illuminating C. Drill thru much smaller for the leads. Glue the bottom of B to the bottom of the c'bore in D. On the bottom of D c'bore wide and shallow 2 places. One for the coin battery. One for a small NC PB switch such that when the box in on a surface the LEDs are off, pick it up they light.

I know that NC is normally closed, but what is PB, power button? That would be really cool to have it only light up when removed from a surface, but at the same time I wouldnt want any visible button protrusions on the bottom...  which is why I was considering a magnetic switch that would only light when I slip a magnet onto the bottom or something.  As for machining it, I had considered machining the full hex and then slicing into sections with the bandsaw for additional machining, OR just doing each piece separately (since its CNC they should still line up correctly, and any small problems could be fixed with filing/polishing.  I will definitely post up a finished product when I get back into school and am able to make it!

Machinists,3daa4x,YouMustChill,5,Tue Jul 14 18:47:01 2015 UTC,"Samples.  No one will believe a word you say about your tools unless you bring a sample for me to try.  You want me to buy something? You damn well better have the price on you. I'm not interested in calling him and her and getting a quote and blah blah blah. If you're pushing the new Corocut QD, bring some along and have a Visa machine for your phone so I can buy it."

I'm not interested in calling him and her and getting a quote and blah blah blah   Seriously. Similarly, if I go to a website and ctrl-f $ finds nothing (or there's an email to ""contact for quotes"") I just walk. I'm not playing that game. If you are selling, sell."
Machinists,3daa4x,ShortbusPilot,2,Wed Jul 15 10:46:46 2015 UTC,"Being a machinists and having a strong background is great. The guy Like dealing with the most is great at returning emails and getting me quotes. Also I don't need you to come to our place and tell me what I can find on youtube, but I know some guys who like having that relationship. The thing I like most from tool salesmen, especially machines, is guys who tell me the price when I ask for it.  I think one of the things that made haas so popular I people can go to their website and get the price with the options they want."
Machinists,3daa4x,drxing,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:00:43 2015 UTC,"Being the easiest to deal with and the path of least resistance. For the most part i feel tooling is a commodity. Oh sure each company might have a handful of products that stand out above the others but for the most part they all have similar stuff. You will win business in two ways either by being the cheapest or by giving someone a level of service that makes them want to continue to deal with you. This level of service could be returning E Mails promptly as the previous person stated,  promptly returning phone calls is important, getting someone part numbers for something they are looking for instead of telling them to look it up in the book, or by simply by letting them know you are ready willing and able to help them if and when they need it. Something I have found, different people require different things. Some people need to be babied and you open the manual and discuss the different products you offer. Some people are so busy that they don't want to be bothered most of the time but when those busy people call, damn they are looking for immediate help. A successful salesman will learn to recognize these different personalities and provide people with what they want. Good luck on this new endeavor."
Machinists,3daa4x,nikolaiownz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:42:21 2015 UTC,I am looking for tools that works.   No salesmen can sell me anything by saying words to me.   I have to test it out myself.
Machinists,3daa4x,DeepSkull,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:53:56 2015 UTC,few things:  I want a rep to get back to me fast.  I know a big part of your job is customer service and you can't always know a answer but let me know you're working on something for me before I just assume you're brushing me off and I go find an answer by myself and buy your competitors product.  Prices. its been mentioned already but know what they are or be able to ballpark a number.  one annoying thing about every tool rep is that whoever they're working fors tools are the best. There is no other option and it comes off as being a huge uninformed asshole. this is further amplified when they jump ship and work for a competitor and then do it all over again.      I DO cal bullshit if you try to sell me a method/something that dosn't hold water too.

Machinists,3d8vc5,shobble,3,Tue Jul 14 12:23:10 2015 UTC,I use a step drill sometimes. Its not like a normal drill in that it wont bite into the plastic. The down side is that you have limited sizes. For anything else I would use an end mill.
Machinists,3d8vc5,Safetylok,3,Tue Jul 14 12:37:58 2015 UTC,Also if you use a ninety degree tip drill but instead of the standard 120 that should help too but make sure to only use them for plastics
Machinists,3d8vc5,Toxicloki,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:26:34 2015 UTC,"This.  If you have access to a darex or something where you can grind a different point, do it.    You can individual drills specifically for plastics, I have several that made by onsrud that are 60Â° even."
Machinists,3d8vc5,jbrandt01,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:59:39 2015 UTC,If you have a belt sander or grinding stone you can free hand it maybe the only other thing I can think of is turn your speed down and don't be aggressive with it
Machinists,3d8vc5,Toxicloki,2,Tue Jul 14 16:52:29 2015 UTC,"Have you tried dubbing the drills?  Lessening the rake angle (and to a lesser degree, the point angle) of a drill in soft materials will significantly reduce grabbing and tearout. It may reduce flexing and cutting forces on the part. The drill will 'scrape' through the part rather than sucking the plastic up onto the flutes. You could even go with a slightly negative rake probably.  If you absolutely positively need an 8.3mm hole then getting an 8.3mm reamer is probably the best option, if you have the time. But you'll have to find it, and it may not be inexpensive. It's much easier to find metric reamers in half-mm increments."
Machinists,3d8vc5,i_can_menage,2,Tue Jul 14 15:06:25 2015 UTC,"That looks to be an extremely useful article, and I've bookmarked for reference, but I barely understand much of what it's saying, and the images aren't all that clear to a noob.  I don't have any grinding jigs, and any freehand attempts I've tried in the past (plain old sharpening) have generally resulted in drillbit suicide.  It looks like it's primarily taking off the outer corners, but I'm not sure what sort of precision is needed here to get a decent result, and how practical it is without a drill sharpener.  I may end up laser-cutting a secondary bezel to precise dims and then just mashing clearance holes through the moulded part, which would make life a whole lot easier."
Machinists,3d8vc5,i_can_menage,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:58:52 2015 UTC,"Dubbing is really easy and dramatically improves drilling in soft plastics - far less tendency to 'auger' in.  It doesn't have to be incredibly precise - just use the side of your bench grinder wheel to grind a small flat parallel with the drill axis, on the lip of the flute, about 0.5mm should suffice. You don't even need to get too close to the chisel of the drill, as the effective rake approaches zero the closer you get to the center of the drill anyway.  And definitely read that article in future. Too few people understand drill geometry and its role in efficiently drilling accurate, straight holes. The images that go with it could be improved dramatically, but if you read the accompanying text it becomes clear enough."
Machinists,3d8vc5,EvanDaniel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:42:42 2015 UTC,"Cheers.  I think my bedtime reading list is going to have to start including something on the wizardry behind drill/mill design, since my current level is somewehre around ""make pointy thing go fast, jam pointy thing into workpiece. Get new workpiece. Repeat""  Any suggestions for absolute newbie level practical material on drilling/milling principles? I'm sure there's got to be something out there in theory-land that ties all the various types of chip-producing metal cutting methods together - relief angles and rakes and bevels and whatnot show up in lathe cutters, drills, mills, and all manner of places.  If my city had any sort of evening-classes in machining or metalworking I'd jump at it to have someone to bug with all my stupid questions :)  Is learning freehand grinding from a standing start practical, or should I look into some sort of jig/clamping setup before I violate any more innocent HSS whilst ""practicing""?  I might have to muck aroudn with lighting and macro photog to get a look at what I'm actually producing, as my eyesight is beyond terrible.  As a footnote to this long ramble, I managed to get my holes mostly where they should be with a combination of a small brad-point wood bit (which actually has negative...cutting angle?), and progressive widening with standard 135o HSS bits, and finishing to final size with a taper reamer with jury-rigged depth stop. Quite pleased with teh end result, although I'm sure it could be improved in many many ways.  Thanks for the pointers, and thanks to everyone else in thread with helpful suggestions, which I'll consider for next time when I have less stupid deadlines."

Machinists,3d8vc5,flyingbootable,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:54:12 2015 UTC,"Do your absolute best to make sure the part is rigidly clamped, ideally tight down to that wood backing. You don't want it moving while cutting, either the whole thing or just part of it as it flexes.  Make sure your drill bits are sharp. Consider drilling a tiny pilot hole first."
Machinists,3d8vc5,Ironman_gq,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:56:23 2015 UTC,"Clamp down as much as possible. Consider placing a sheet or something over top if possible and drilling through it. Use a razor sharp bit, this is important. Finally, it should have a 90 or less point on it. Keep rpm down to avoid melting the material, you want it to chip."
Machinists,3d8vc5,digganickrick,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:12:37 2015 UTC,"I am not a machinist, but I used to work with one. He would run a newish bit backwards, and seemed to work well. It wouldn't bite, and the back of the tip had enough edge to cut the plastic. It made a bit of a doughnut on the surface but the hole cut true. He would just clean it up with a razor"
Machinists,3d8vc5,DutchCaptaine,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:31:45 2015 UTC,"I've had good luck running backwards, more melts than cuts. A burr of the right size also works well. You can also ramp the speed way up and peck at it till your through, but takes smaller bites and is less grabby than trying to push through in one shot."
