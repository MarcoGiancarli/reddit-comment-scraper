ImaginaryJedi,3cshiz,lucky_whiplash,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:11:55 2015 UTC,"I don't like the helmet or armor. Its to flashy for imho. Vader's should be sleek and menacing. He is scary because of what he is, he doesn't need something with horns and skulls to prove it. really he is scary because he doesn't have those things. HE doesn't need to tell anyone to be afraid because they know to be."
