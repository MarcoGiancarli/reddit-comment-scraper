The front row tickets are being sold at MSG for almost $6000 a piece. It's madness.   Why can't they have name assignments like the Europe tour? GRRR!   Not even a musician as big as Gilmour can escape the grasp of ticketmaster. It's because they own several music venues. It's crap.

It'd be like if they released a new album on vinyl and it was limited to 1000 individual number copies and you got number 1000. You'd be at a 100/10 on happiness.

pinkfloyd,3e39pa,dmw1987,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:19:38 2015 UTC,He would probably swap one or two songs out for other ones. On these tours he typically has a few songs he alternates between nights.  Here's his 1st Radio City concert from 2006:  http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/david-gilmour/2006/radio-city-music-hall-new-york-ny-3d61517.html  Here's his 2nd Radio City concert from 2006:  http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/david-gilmour/2006/radio-city-music-hall-new-york-ny-bd61516.html  You can see Fat Old Sun and Dominoes were traded for Wots...

pinkfloyd,3dzvv1,Megalandrys,2,Wed Jul 22 01:53:58 2015 UTC,i've made one for wish you were here in my mind many times.   basically a music video to the entire album from beginning to end. used to daydream it when i younger and riding as a passenger with my walkman on listening to it.

pinkfloyd,3dzvv1,erkwxdl,2,Tue Jul 21 15:48:28 2015 UTC,I'd make an epic space epic with solely Pink Floyd music. Like my idea for 2001.

pinkfloyd,3dyyc8,TheXtremeDino,15,Mon Jul 20 17:49:54 2015 UTC,Come back when you complete it.  I'd be curious to hear it.  Personally I'm so used to the original that I might have a hard time accepting it.
pinkfloyd,3dyyc8,Yum_Kaax,5,Mon Jul 20 17:51:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah. But, it could turn out great or it could turn out terrible."
pinkfloyd,3dyyc8,Yum_Kaax,8,Mon Jul 20 17:53:12 2015 UTC,"I'm leaning towards terrible but that's no reason to not try.  Just remember that the classical score of 2001 was in direct contrast with the futuristic movie.  A certain irony, you might say.  I don't think lyrics would work well with any part of the movie.  The entire intro scene is without dialog for a reason.  Adding lyrics would sort of ruin the quiet stillness, pre-language era, that showed the progress of mankind."
pinkfloyd,3dyyc8,Yum_Kaax,6,Mon Jul 20 18:00:06 2015 UTC,"I had that idea, but Floyd have a lot of instrumentation for use and there are scenes at the beginning which have no music playing anyway."
pinkfloyd,3dyyc8,PinkFloydJoe,5,Mon Jul 20 18:02:04 2015 UTC,"Look into some of their early work, such as More and Zabrieski and Obscured."
pinkfloyd,3dyyc8,GroovingPict,2,Mon Jul 20 18:02:39 2015 UTC,"I will, I'll obviously listen to as much material as possible before choosing."
pinkfloyd,3dyyc8,Funky_Dung,5,Mon Jul 20 18:04:22 2015 UTC,"I would recommend sticking to Instrumental Pink Floyd songs, or Instrumental sections out of their popular songs. The Endless River has a lot of cinematic style songs, like Unsung."
pinkfloyd,3dyyc8,Funky_Dung,2,Mon Jul 20 18:34:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I was hoping to do but I can't think of too many."
pinkfloyd,3dyyc8,colin_creevey,4,Mon Jul 20 18:36:18 2015 UTC,"Echoes to Jupiter And Beyond is obvious, as it is a well known ""sync"". I think Celestial Voices will probably fit in somewhere, perhaps the whole A Saucerful of Secrets piece. I feel The Embryo would be fitting somewhere perhaps with the space child. I think you should stick with pieces that are either completely or largely instrumental."

Dark Side, WYWH, The Wall, Division Bell and Echoes: Best of.  There's also Roger Waters' Amused To Death.  http://www.i-m.mx/FunkyDung/SaucerfulOfSyncs/pink-floyd.html  Also check in the Roger Waters section for that setup.  There're all rather enjoyable (not on drugs too)."

Love Scene (Version 4) could work at the beginning of Mission to Jupiter (18 Months Later).  Other tracks I'd consider are the early mix of The Great Gig in the Sky, Atom Heart Mother, One of These Days, The Narrow Way (Part II), and live versions of Embryo, Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun (perhaps without the vocals), Careful with That Axe, Eugene, Any Colour You Like, and Cymbaline."

pinkfloyd,3dy4y7,Spirit0fRadi0,4,Mon Jul 20 17:12:32 2015 UTC,I took it more as they were still very successful without him. I couldn't believe how much time they spent on The Dark Side of the Rainbow.

pinkfloyd,3dzpib,PinkFloydJoe,6,Mon Jul 20 21:00:43 2015 UTC,"Roger Waters appearance confirmed!     No but seriously, I don't think he will play the album in full on any of the dates, there will definitely be a good mix, I don't think he is too worried about keeping these songs secret, like the Endless River, that was some top secret shit right there."
pinkfloyd,3dzpib,pinkfloydfan4life,4,Mon Jul 20 21:16:06 2015 UTC,Pink Floyd were always known for playing unreleased music during their shows. Dark Side was played live well before the album was completed and the same with Animals. Maybe the trend continues.
pinkfloyd,3dzpib,wackyg74,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:27:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah but Mason said they kinda stopped due to bootlegging. When Gilmour first played Smile in 2001 he also said ""This is a new one so if you are bootlegging, start your machines now""."
pinkfloyd,3dzpib,maakuz,3,Tue Jul 21 06:24:14 2015 UTC,Maybe to generate hype or something?  I'm sure he isn't afraid to play it or some songs off of it before release.
pinkfloyd,3dzpib,mrw412,2,Mon Jul 20 21:13:11 2015 UTC,"If anything, having a few shows just slightly ahead of the album release is only an opportunity for live versions to leak from cell-phone footage and such -- but only very slightly in advance of the actual album release.  If anything, this will only create more demand/hype for the album, since it will wet everyone's appetite for a couple short weeks (I'm not sure of the exact schedule, but these four shows aren't that far in advance of the release date, are they?).  Seems like a good idea to generate more buzz about the album, actually."
pinkfloyd,3dzpib,Rooster_Ties,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:46:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that seems about right. The earliest show is only 6 days from the album release date, so it will probably generate lots of hype. I know I'll be on YouTube looking!"
pinkfloyd,3dzpib,Rooster_Ties,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:00:39 2015 UTC,"6 days is perfect.  Not long enough for anyone to actually cash in by selling bootlegs of live performances of the new material -- but still in advance of the actual release.  Perfect timing, from a PR/promo perspective.  Kudos to them!"
pinkfloyd,3dzpib,Airbornefeline_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:05:36 2015 UTC,Also it's extremely likely the full album will leak online before the shows anyway. Pretty much every major album release leaks online at least a week early.
pinkfloyd,3dyqgu,pinkfloydfan4life,5,Mon Jul 20 16:54:54 2015 UTC,"I was wondering the same thing when I read the announcement.  Rolling Stone, October 2014:  What kind of venues are you going to play? You played Radio City Music Hall the last time you were in New York when you could have easily played Madison Square Garden. (lol)   ""That's what I was saying before. The huge scale and size of Pink Floyd was something I wanted to gently back away from a bit. I wanted to make these things more personal and more manageable. This time, to be honest, I haven't really gotten to the discussion point yet. But I'm not intending to play vast places, though I'm sure people will try and persuade me otherwise. But, you know. Radio City Music Hall sounds like the right sort of vibe for me.""   I feel like someone else pressured him to play larger venues. Now I know nobody could make David Gilmour do anything he didn't really want to, but that's like the complete opposite of what he said in 2014. Coming off the rails of The Endless River and now Rattle That Lock, his managers and promoters probably know where the money is (big venues).  Maybe he thinks playing Madison Square Garden one night is easier than playing Radio City Music Hall for 2 nights?"
pinkfloyd,3dyqgu,PinkFloydJoe,2,Mon Jul 20 17:10:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, David does like to surprise the fans from time to time, and never reveals anything beforehand, even when it seems like he does, either way, I am excited no matter what!"
pinkfloyd,3dyqgu,mrw412,9,Mon Jul 20 17:28:51 2015 UTC,Maybe but I think he used to be in this little band called Pink Floyd so that may have made him some money.

pinkfloyd,3dyqgu,dmw1987,3,Mon Jul 20 17:40:09 2015 UTC,Probably because there are only a few dates. Though I'd love him to rock out big time.

pinkfloyd,3dyqgu,Rhuey13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:32:57 2015 UTC,"There were 10 total shows in North America for the On An Island tour. 2 each in New York, Toronto, Chicago, Oakland and LA. All in smaller venues. This time around there are 4 total shows (New York, Toronto, Chicago and LA) all in larger venues. Seems he's going for one show in a larger venue vs two shows in a smaller venue. And the On An Island tour was not ""more acoustic versions"" of Floyd material, at least the Oakland show I went to wasn't. He rocked out just as hard as he could in any larger venue. It was just a more intimate experience."
pinkfloyd,3dyqgu,dmw1987,2,Mon Jul 20 18:39:18 2015 UTC,"He has said that this is his ""Old Man tour"""
pinkfloyd,3dyqgu,PinkFloydJoe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:09:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, meaning minimal dates, but does he intend on rocking out? Thats what I am getting at"
pinkfloyd,3dyqgu,dmw1987,2,Mon Jul 20 17:25:34 2015 UTC,I'm guessing because it's his final time coming over to North America and wants to get as many people involved in as few dates as he possibly can without trying and failing to fill football stadiums.
pinkfloyd,3dyqgu,enstrut,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:31:52 2015 UTC,Is this truly his last time? I know he's getting old but has he actually definitively said that? I'm just curious. I've got tickets for Madison Square Garden so I'm happy but curious if it is his last.
pinkfloyd,3dyqgu,wbsmbg,2,Mon Jul 20 20:25:40 2015 UTC,"He never said it was but he's 70 or close to it, and he doesn't really like touring too much. I mean, never say never, but I wouldn't imagine he has too many dates left in him."
pinkfloyd,3dyqgu,grelch,0,Mon Jul 20 20:26:17 2015 UTC,"You don't think David could fill a football stadium? Well maybe not on his own name, but if he named the show ""David Gilmour of Pink Floyd"" or something like that I think he could definitely still fill one."

pinkfloyd,3dyzw8,PinkFloydJoe,3,Mon Jul 20 18:59:29 2015 UTC,"I did a small ""cover"" of his solo, it got flagged by the system pretty quiickly (which is fine, it's not mine) but it was weird because I just recorded two chords in a loop pedal. However, a big Pink Floyd channel who is well known on YouTube saw it and added it to his ""Who to look out for"" or whatever playlist and said he loved that no one had really done this one. It was a nice moment for me. Also I love the song, one of my favorite Gilmour solos. It's so god damn creative."

pinkfloyd,3dxh06,Blizz310,13,Tue Jul 21 08:16:20 2015 UTC,"I always love that during Gilmour's solos when he doesn't play a lot of notes I succession, but he has them long and strung out. Most notably in Time and the 2nd solo in Comfortably Numb. He also does it in echoes. I love guitar solos in that fashion, also explains why Wet Sand by RHCP is one of my favorite songs ever."
pinkfloyd,3dxh06,Fcorange5,6,Mon Jul 20 12:31:10 2015 UTC,"That's a really underrated song. There are some real gems on Stadium Arcadium (I'm partial to the last two songs, played back-to-back), but Wet Sand is a fantastic tune. I agree, great solo too."
pinkfloyd,3dxh06,redhotkurt,5,Mon Jul 20 14:45:29 2015 UTC,"I think that album has some of John Frusciante's best work, including some of his solo stuff. He's one of the guitarists that is just so in-tune with their sound that you can't separate them."
pinkfloyd,3dxh06,Fcorange5,3,Mon Jul 20 15:16:17 2015 UTC,"I never tire of that album. I have bittersweet/fond (but mostly fond) memories attributed to when I first heard it, bought it, played it over and over again. Can you believe it came out almost ten years ago?   Yeah, Frusciante has that unmistakable sound. I think he absolutely nailed it on that album. They should have credited his guitar as a backing vocalist, if you ask me."
pinkfloyd,3dxh06,redhotkurt,2,Mon Jul 20 16:03:58 2015 UTC,"Wow, it seems like yesterday it came out. I like that comment about backing vocalist haha. Actually, in some respects, John has a better voice than Anthony."

So delicate and perfect. Live Wembley 1974- Transition between Time and Great Gig. No delay. Shoulda been on the album this way Dogs (album version) - The single note after the slow acoustic guitar. First heard it from a juke box in a dive. It shot through me like lightning.  Breathe - First few notes.... Can't mistake it Atom Heart Mother (BBC live 1970) - the last 4-5 minutes.

After a few spins I'm enjoying it more. It has a really catchy melody (and the chorus too). I've been going through my day with ""♫♪♫ Rattle that lock, lose those chains! ♫♪♫"" playing in my head, and that jingle.  The solos are average for a Gilmour song, but the 2nd one is more enjoyable.  I'm sure when he starts playing these songs Live they'll evolve somewhat. Most of the stuff from Live in Gdansk is better than the studio version of On An Island. Overall I give the song 6/10, still excited for what's to come!"

I don't want to screw up your expectations of it -- it's not all spectacular, but it's so often overlooked that it really probably is Floyd's more underrated album (as opposed to Animals, which everyone claims is underrated -- and maybe it is by the general public -- but most Floyd fans are all over Animals, but not so much OBC)."

After Syd left came More, in which the band tried their hardest to sound like Syd and found no real fulfillment. They had no idea what they, as a band, should really sound like - what they're instrumentation should be, what their sound should be, etc., without Syd.  So they split into four pieces and composed an entire album not as a band, but as four individual artists. The result was a very wide array of sounds and styles that they could then pull from and decide what they actually wanted to do. The result of that become Atom Heart Mother, a style that was perfected in Meddle and then put into full effect in The Dark Side of the Moon."

Most people agree, though, that the Suite is great.  However, it is not the most underrated album. In terms of fan recognition, Piper is pretty underrated, and Animals is sort of to some. In actual ratings, like from critics, ASoS and The Final Cut are better albums with lower/similar ratings."

Pigs (Three Different Ones) is my favorite of the songs, I like the ""HA HAAAAA, charade you are"" a lot.  Sheep is too slow and long in my opinion, I actually like Dogs a bit better than this one.  Animals isn't in my top 5 Floyd albums, I'd probably put (in no particular order) DSotM, The Wall, The Division Bell, Atom Heart Mother, Ummagumma, and Meddle before it.

For instance, Gilmour has said the album was ""a load of rubbish. We were at a real down point ... I think we were scraping the barrel a bit at that period"" and ""a good idea but it was dreadful... Atom Heart Mother sounds like we didn't have any idea between us, but we became much more prolific after it."" Similarly, in a 1984 interview on BBC Radio 1, Waters said ""If somebody said to me now – right – here's a million pounds, go out and play Atom Heart Mother, I'd say you must be fucking joking."""
pinkfloyd,3drxm8,queensavior,16,Sun Jul 19 01:17:26 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I could see why it could be considered one of the most underrated albums. A lot of this consensus on this sub is that Obscured by Clouds is one of the most underrated albums, but that depends on the person.

Fat old sun (so beautiful), If, Summer 68, and ofc AHM (the song) are all amazing and totally underrated when compared to other Floyd classics imo. Place it after Meddle but before Piper.   I'd still say Animals is the most underrated among mainstream fans. Since most people think of DSotM -> WYWH/Wall -> WYWH/Wall, and they completely forget about Animals.  Among die-hard Floyd fans I'd agree that it is probably, Atom Heart Mother. Animals is actually understood for its greatness among us luckily!"

pinkfloyd,3drxm8,smokedjowls,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:26:18 2015 UTC,"Eh, I don't think it's a very good album.  It kind of encapsulates the worst elements of prog rock.  Even the studio side of Ummagumma had more interesting moments.  Cool cover art, though."

pinkfloyd,3drxm8,DosPassos421919,-1,Sun Jul 19 15:01:10 2015 UTC,"I just don't think it's that good of an album altogether - it's justifiably criticized. Atom Heart Mother Suite is really the only redeemable thing on the album, and even that doesn't stand up as well against their other material - even the live versions they played as a four man team (without the orchestra) were miles better than the album version. 'If' is a musically boring song, so is 'Summer '68'. Fat Old Sun is just an okay song (again, the version they did at the BBC studios in '71 was much better), and Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast, while interesting, feels like a scrambled mess of instrumental jams lumped together, which probably would have worked if each section of the song had been split into separate tracks and elaborated upon.   The classic 'underrated' album is Obscured by Clouds (probably couldn't be classified as that now because it's gained enthusiastic praise from the community). All of it's songs seem to work together and as individual elements.   With Atom Heart Mother (minus the suite) all I see are scraps of unrefined material.   There are plenty of other albums which aren't recognized with due praise, and perhaps are more deserving of that recognition that Atom Heart Mother. 'More' for instance, or even 'The Final Cut' which people disparage because of it's complete lack of 'Pink Floyd' sounding material.   I don't hate the album, but Pink Floyd have produced much better records that don't see the same praise as their more popular ones."
pinkfloyd,3drxm8,XxmunkehxX,5,Sat Jul 18 22:08:12 2015 UTC,"Really, your going to say More is more musically cohesive than AHM?"
pinkfloyd,3drxm8,BamaDillert,5,Sat Jul 18 23:12:28 2015 UTC,"More is a soundtrack album, so it should be cohesive. But More has only a few good songs on it, and what isn't good is terrible. AHM is at least a decent album all around. I don't know what he means when he says AHM is choppy - it doesn't seem that way to me (at least in terms of its music - it's not consistent conceptually, but it sounds like a finished whole)."
pinkfloyd,3drxm8,XxmunkehxX,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:36:28 2015 UTC,"Maybe cohesive wasn't the right word, but calling AHM choppy, and parts of it musically boring then going on to say More deserves more praise seems a bit contradictory to me (don't get me wrong, I love More but I think AHM is definitely the superior of the two)"

pinkfloyd,3dshbd,ZxR,4,Sun Jul 19 14:54:57 2015 UTC,"Man, Main Theme is one of the most incredible pieces of music I've heard in my life. The part when the keyboard comes in is a musical moment to rival the final guitar solo in Echoes."
pinkfloyd,3dshbd,Esperanzan,3,Sun Jul 19 02:27:17 2015 UTC,"""Main Theme"" is great, and I've always been partial to ""Green is the Colour"", particularly some of the live versions. The highlight of ""More"" for me, though, is ""Quicksilver"". Awesome example of how they can get out there and still be melodious, and Rick's wandering keyboard lines with the effects fading in and out, it's just pure psychedelic music and just beautiful."
pinkfloyd,3dshbd,plecostomusworld,3,Sun Jul 19 01:15:37 2015 UTC,Nile Song/ Cymbaline are both in my top 15 Floyd songs all time. Wish this album got more recognition.

pinkfloyd,3dsooi,pinkfloydfan4life,2,Sun Jul 19 02:34:20 2015 UTC,"I was actually wondering about the length, that is good, I was hoping for a long show, I think the setlist is the first side of Dark Side Of The Moon, and then SOYCD, See Emily Play, Money, Sheep, Have A Cigar, Wish You Were Here, Louder Than Words, Set The Controls..., See Emily Play, The Final Cut, On The Turning Away, Keep Talking, and then the last side of The Wall, but did they play anything else as a surprise?"
pinkfloyd,3dsooi,pinkfloydfan4life,2,Sun Jul 19 02:42:15 2015 UTC,"I did not keep track of the set list I am sorry to say.  I looked at their set lists from previous stops this tour and the show I saw was pretty much what they were doing elsewhere.  There were no surprises from that point of view.    What I was delighted about was the light show in general but especially during Comfortably Numb.  I will say no more.  I also loved the way they presented their ""The Wall"" set.  It was totally in theme with the album/movie.  I was surprised about that.  We had upper level seats that were sort of far from the stage.  I was worried it would not be loud enough.  My worries were unfounded.  It was loud enough to feel the music as well as hear it.  It was perfect.    If you are a PF purists, you won't like it.

I'd like to see slide as well but I thought he captured some slide elements with the tremolo arm and that he expressed a heart-felt feel through the instrument.   Really bothered me that he used a pick on the acoustic solo though haha ;). Mr. Gilmour always plays that one with fingers only

And maybe a couple more Pink Floyd songs, I really want him to sing There's No Way Out Of Here, I don't think he has done that one since the 80s."
pinkfloyd,3drg96,pinkfloydfan4life,3,Sat Jul 18 19:20:39 2015 UTC,I feel like it's almost guaranteed that Comfortably Numb will end the show. I'm hoping for Echoes like on his previous tour

pinkfloyd,3drg96,PinkFloydJoe,4,Sat Jul 18 22:38:34 2015 UTC,Would love for him to do Fearless as a throwback like he did with Wot's... Uh The Deal?
pinkfloyd,3drg96,Megalandrys,4,Sat Jul 18 19:28:04 2015 UTC,"Songs I'm realistically hoping for:  Pink Floyd stuff:  Breathe, Comfortably Numb, Wish You Were Here, Shine On, Louder Than Words (please more of TER), High Hopes, One of These Days??  David's solo material:  The Blue, Take a Breath, Rattle That Lock material, Raise My Rent?"
pinkfloyd,3drg96,PinkFloydJoe,2,Sat Jul 18 21:39:32 2015 UTC,"""Breathe"" is an eh, but if he did he'd for sure combine it with the reprise like at Live8, I believe (for whatever reason). I don't think ""Shine On"", though, because the main part of the entire intro, and a lot of the parts people overlook during everything after, especially in Parts 6-9, was done by Rick, and I sadly don't see him playing it without him, but it is a possibility.  I think he'll do ""Money"", for some reason. Maybe as an encore. They did that a lot in '75-'78 tours, I believe."
pinkfloyd,3drg96,zosorose,3,Sat Jul 18 22:37:03 2015 UTC,"I was hoping for a more stripped down version of Shine On, like he did at Meltdown Or even like the version he did on the 2006 tour without the Wine glasses"
pinkfloyd,3drg96,Epsilon76,3,Sat Jul 18 22:43:12 2015 UTC,"What I want and expect- Shine On, C Numb, High Hopes  What I want that might happen- Time, Louder Than Words, Coming Back To Life, other selections from Dark Side, WYWH, Momentary Lapse, and Division Bell  What I want but are highly unlikely- more from The Endless River, Echoes, a song from Animals"

pinkfloyd,3do7oz,Gamermoes02,2,Sat Jul 18 06:06:04 2015 UTC,"I didn't mind the lyrics to Louder than Words, but these are kinda jarring. David makes up for it by singing with such energy and enthusiasm, but there's no denying Roger's talent with words and the impact that it had on PF. Honestly I think David is a better lyricist than Polly and he should be writing his own words."

pinkfloyd,3dmjht,Paperloader,3,Fri Jul 17 14:14:03 2015 UTC,Because Ticketmaster sells the vast majority of tickets to scalpers before offering them to the public. They offer a pathetic few to keep up appearances.
pinkfloyd,3dmjht,spudzilla,2,Fri Jul 17 16:42:46 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it is legal but it seems unethical as hell. So... they sell them to the scalpers, with a mark-up no doubt, but why don't they just increase the price and sell all to the public?"
pinkfloyd,3dmjht,zosorose,3,Fri Jul 17 17:28:51 2015 UTC,More middlemen means more profit all around.   Also helps keep them insulated from complaints of high prices

Managed to snag 4 tickets for myself, dad and 2 best friends in bridge seating section 311 for 250 bucks a pop about 15 minutes after they went on sale. Went from being the most pissed off I've ever been to the happiest I've ever been very quickly.  Has anybody here ever been to the new MSG?

I would pay the higher prices if I knew even half of that were going to the band/crew. It's all scalpers and F everything about that. Some of the terrace seats are up at $10, 675 a piece right now.

I'm actually only 17 and have been a fan since 2009, when my mom gave me Dark Side of the Moon and simply said ""listen to it all in one shot."" And it was all set in stone from there. The only chance for seeing anyone from Floyd play since becoming a fan would've been Waters' The Wall tour, but i just didn't hear about tickets until it was too late. This is so so exciting.

pinkfloyd,3do9rl,paulblart_smallcop,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:05:13 2015 UTC,"It's really no different drawing his face than any other, right? All I can say is use a picture with decent lighting and a high resolution. Map out the features as you would a normal face. Faces generally follow the same guide lines - eyes tend to be a certain length apart (usually the width of an eye), the corners Of the lips match with the center of the eyes, etc. Maybe it's the concept of face drawing you need work on, not just a specific face. I drew this of Syd some time ago, and the biggest issue I had was with the left side of the face, where the shadow partly occludes the features. It wasn't really a matter of his specific facial structure that was difficult, but the actual composition of the photo.   As long as you have a decent grasp of how to map out and draw faces, and the photo you have is a good resolution and is composed well enough, you shouldn't have much trouble."

I was only 16 when that album came out and I never caught the tour.  Always told myself I need to see David if I ever get another chance.  Going to try to get tickets tomorrow even though I'm in Ohio, it's totally worth the trip."
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,Heff228,3,Fri Jul 17 02:49:56 2015 UTC,Traveling from southwest Florida to Toronto for the concert. Worth the trip. I'd travel even further need be. First time seeing him. Never seen Rodger. Yet.
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,KingKrunK239,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:39:06 2015 UTC,"Aw man. If you get a chance, see Roger!. Saw him in New Zealand on The Wall tour. So good! He has really worked on his vocal ability. I wasn't expecting it to be so good as he is pretty old now but damn he can still sing! Plus he extended the NZ shows from 2 to like 5(Because they kept selling out). Ridiculous to think he put on 5 quality shows night after night.   Unfortunately I haven't been fortunate enough to see David or Nick play :( I really wanted to see Rick play too but.. Yeah."
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,A_K_o_V_A,5,Fri Jul 17 13:18:03 2015 UTC,"I hate to burst your bubble, but Roger did a lot of lipsynching on The Wall tour. I sat in front and witnessed the horror. I was disappointed because I had read an article where he stated that he was seeing a vocal coach and everything to help him get back into form, but then I remembered that the guy is getting old and wasn't that great of a vocalist to begin with."
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,floydfan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:05:28 2015 UTC,"He was definitely singing the whole time, but he was being aided by backing tracks that he recorded before the start of the tour.    All I can say is, who cares? The show was an amazing spectacle and he gave it all he had. Would you rather he poorly and weakly sang the whole thing with a naked voice, instead?"
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,MadChef26,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:45:14 2015 UTC,"I saw the wall tour front row and he sang the entire show with authority, including hey you. I've seen Roger 6 times and his vocal performances were impressive each time."

pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,floyd631,8,Fri Jul 17 02:05:55 2015 UTC,Yea I feel the same way. I didn't really like On an Island when it first came out but now I love it
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,amchaudhry,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:13:36 2015 UTC,"Same here - - took me a while to 'get it' but now its a favorite.  Same goes for DG's first solo album.  This track is David Gilmour taking a clear left turn from the sound he got typecasted into over 35 years of playing.  This is much more R&B David Gilmour, and I think the train station tone they did on repeat as the beat was really clever. Cannot wait to see him in LA."
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,grelch,11,Sat Jul 18 05:06:35 2015 UTC,"If I'm honest, and I am, it's ok to ok minus. Where I defended the lyrics on Louder than Words, I'm not going to be able to with this one. ""gotta do it"" ""get through it"" ""lets go do it"" ""go back where we blew it"" montage is bonafide cringe. Anyhow, I think I saw on the album notes someone posted last night that there'll be an extended version of this song on the fancy version. I'm not sure what else need be added to this track. Oh well. I don't dislike it, but there'll be at least one track on the album that doesn't do much for me. I hope it stays at one."
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,hooman8675309,3,Fri Jul 17 04:45:03 2015 UTC,"exactly how I feel. the lyrics are too 'rhyme-y' and juvenile. The guitar sounds very much like Gilmour, blues-y with his signature sound, but there isn't much of them. Song sounds like a late 80s pop song would sound like. Its not bad, but not very good either. I really hope the rest of the album is better."
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,floydfan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:08:17 2015 UTC,When I heard it that's exactly what I thought. The sound is very dated. Like Sting helped Polly write it.
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,Matt_Ron,5,Fri Jul 17 15:04:03 2015 UTC,They just played it on BBC Radio 2. Didn't expect it to be so poppy but I kinda liked it a bit. His voice is good. The two solos are amazing! Overall it reminded me a bit of About Face.
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,hannibellecter,5,Fri Jul 17 08:13:11 2015 UTC,"OK, so to me this is about what I expect from a David Gilmour record in 2015.  I could have done without the backing vocals during his solo which was surprising (in a very good way) of being a ""basic"" blues Gilmour solo.  It would be great to hear his take on some of his roots shine through on the other songs too.  Overall a B+ due to shaky lyrics (although they get better in the second half) and overused backing vocals.  But that guitar is still sounding fantastic and that voice is still sounding sweet so rock on!  Can't wait for the whole record."
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,ScarySquirrel,3,Fri Jul 17 08:20:35 2015 UTC,"Funny that he's used the French train announcement noise in the song. The song itself is ok, it gets better as it goes on. Looking forward to hearing it live in September :)"
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,AGuysBlues,3,Fri Jul 17 08:35:04 2015 UTC,"My gods, this bugs me! I live in Paris, commute on the train and hearing that jingle in there really grinds my brain because it reminds me of hanging around at stations on my way to work.  Not a great experience for me sadly :/"
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,ScarySquirrel,2,Fri Jul 17 15:06:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can imagine. For me it just reminds me of travelling around the south of France by train, which was a lot more fun than your waiting at stations in Paris by the sounds of it :)"

pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,gm4,3,Fri Jul 17 16:14:37 2015 UTC,I'm surprised this sub doesn't like On An Island. It's the most Pink Floyd record since 1979.
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,gm4,2,Fri Jul 17 21:33:45 2015 UTC,I think most people like some of On An Island. I for one like 90% of it (The Blue could have been a Pink Floyd song imo).  I feel like this song is a regression from what he was doing on OAI. We'll see how the rest of the album stands out.  EDIT: And I think the most 'Pink Floyd' record since 1979 is The Endless River.
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,catOnLollerskates,2,Fri Jul 17 21:35:29 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm going to be pretty honest and say it's not for me. I'm really hoping theres some dark stuff on the rest.

pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,__________________l,5,Fri Jul 17 02:14:56 2015 UTC,"Not bad at all! I hope I like this album more than On An Island.  For some reason, I never really fell in love with that album.  I much prefer David Gilmour & About Face.  No matter what I think of the lyrics on his post-2000 work, his guitar playing more than makes up for it.  My god, his playing gives me goosebumps still."
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,WLLMWM-phil,2,Fri Jul 17 03:51:02 2015 UTC,"Right there with you buddy =)  Seriously, goosebumps."
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,RegularNameWasTaken,3,Fri Jul 17 08:23:29 2015 UTC,David has been known to have a really poppy song or two (that he usually promotes with) so I'm actually more excited to hear what else is in store since this is actually pretty solid.
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,PourJarsInReservoirs,5,Fri Jul 17 04:01:57 2015 UTC,I thought it was interesting. Dave's voice and his guitar playing are still the bomb.
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,Eggy216,8,Fri Jul 17 05:43:12 2015 UTC,I hope the rest of the album isn't this awful
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,NonnerJonner,2,Fri Jul 17 05:29:52 2015 UTC,It does work better as a whole track for me. And I'm hoping it'll be even better in the context of the whole album.
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,greenjp44,2,Fri Jul 17 02:27:34 2015 UTC,"The song isn't that great, but I'm glad to see that he's still got it. Hopefully the rest of the album is better, but just knowing he's still able to sing and play is enough that I'll probably buy it on release."
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,theghostpepper,2,Fri Jul 17 14:45:21 2015 UTC,I'm loving this.  Totally sounds like his earlier solo stuff.  SO EXCITED FOR THE NEW ALBUM!
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,KingKrunK239,4,Fri Jul 17 21:01:43 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one that feels that Gilmour's guitar playing has slowed down greatly?  Not that he was ever a speed king but his newer solos seem to contain a lot less notes than what he used to play (example of old guitar style here).  Even in The Endless River, there seemed to be a clear difference between his 90's playing and the more recent playing.  Not that it's necessarily bad, he did a fantastic job with Louder than Words, but I am kind of hoping the entire album isn't like that."
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,gravballe,4,Fri Jul 17 06:04:16 2015 UTC,Well he's getting older.  No shame in it really.  We all got to get old sometime.

pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,hendrix-,2,Fri Jul 17 08:10:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know, his recent solos in echoes contain some speedy fingerwork which never appeared earlier. I don't think it is a lack of capability, I just think he prefers to play slowly and focus on each note."
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,floydfan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:22:39 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that when he plays old songs live, he skips a lot of notes that are on the studio version. Is it possible that you're hearing these skipped notes as a slower play?"
pinkfloyd,3dkq6g,Rossegut,3,Fri Jul 17 15:09:55 2015 UTC,"Interesting, but pretty cheesy. Probably the worst of the three I've heard by a mile (there were a couple of other songs leaked a while back and posted here)."

The interesting quotes to me were about family...  Rick, Nick, and Dave all talked about how it was like a family.   Roger said- Nope. Not like a family.   That is not to say that either side is right, just how each 'side' sees it. Maybe that is why they never could get over it for any extended period and go back out.   Where Roger also talks about Cincinnati and mentions that they were playing 'my music'. Not 'our music' but 'my' music.   I've seen some videos of them performing here and there together but not as Floyd- primarily Roger's The Wall things.   Sorry for going off on a tangent there.   Good find."

pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,Rossegut,10,Thu Jul 16 11:53:16 2015 UTC,"The overdone photoshop perfection looks cheesy to me. And birds being set free? Yikes man that's cliche.  Good that he's still making music though, I'll give it a listen for sure."
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,MaxCHEATER64,7,Thu Jul 16 17:03:46 2015 UTC,"A cliche is still better than On an Island's cover, which was literally a drawing of a man on an island. And i liked that cover."
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,Rossegut,6,Thu Jul 16 20:34:45 2015 UTC,"The cover to On an Island was lazy, but at least it was easy on the eyes. This new cover is so uninspired, it just gives me the washed up vibe a lot of musicians assume as they age. Which sucks because Gilmour's a great guitarist. But oh well, I'm going to try not to let the artwork sway me too much, the music is what really matters anyway!"
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,Rooster_Ties,7,Thu Jul 16 21:41:21 2015 UTC,"A little cheesy, but I like the muted choice of colors (maybe colours is more appropriate).  I like it better than the cover for TER, for instance."
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,PharOutMan,13,Thu Jul 16 17:21:00 2015 UTC,"Wow, it is very reminiscent of a Storm Thorgerson style cover.  Whoever designed it is doing right by him. I dig it"
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,PinkFloydJoe,11,Thu Jul 16 16:18:51 2015 UTC,Rattle That Lock's striking cover has art directed by Dave Stansbie from The Creative Corporation under the creative directorship of Aubrey Powell from Hipgnosis.   Aubrey Powell was Storm's creative partner in Hipgnosis.
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,ragby,13,Thu Jul 16 16:22:42 2015 UTC,Already nervous about trying to get tickets.  And no presale for the faithful!
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,jorellano,10,Thu Jul 16 13:38:02 2015 UTC,How many Pink Floyd songs would Gilmour actually play during the concert? And how long is he generally on for?  Fan of his solo work... but I'd be there primarily for the PF content if I'm being totally honest.
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,PinkFloydJoe,17,Thu Jul 16 16:16:05 2015 UTC,"Here's what David Gilmour's 2006 On An Island tour looked like as far as the typical setlist goes:   Speak To Me / Breathe Time On An Island (the entire album) Shine On You Crazy Diamond (1-5) Fat Old Sun Arnold Layne Coming Back To Life High Hopes Echoes Wish You Were Here Comfortably Numb   So basically it's entirely Pink Floyd music and his new album in full, that's what I'm banking on. Comfortably Numb is pretty much a guarantee, as well as Breathe I think. He would probably do Louder Than Words too."
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,jorellano,14,Thu Jul 16 16:28:27 2015 UTC,"Damn, that is one glorious set list."
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,PinkFloydJoe,11,Thu Jul 16 16:42:59 2015 UTC,"Yes it is, but with Rick Wright gone don't expect Time or Echoes, I doubt he'd do them without Rick. Still expect plenty of Pink Floyd hits. He still sounds great!"
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,Rooster_Ties,8,Thu Jul 16 16:52:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would have to agree. Time, definitely not -- and probably not Echoes either (though the crowds would love it).  Also, doing Echoes means at least two others songs that he wouldn't get to do (the length of Echoes is at least that of the length of two average songs).  I for one would rather hear more songs he hasn't done as a solo act, especially Childhood's End - and even a song or two from either of his first two solo albums.  (But that's just me.)"
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,flamingllama33,5,Thu Jul 16 19:49:39 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I was pretty pumped about those, and then I got really sad :/"
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,grelch,2,Thu Jul 16 18:38:30 2015 UTC,"Shine On might be in jeopardy as well. It'll be the entire new album a chunk of OAI, probably High Hopes, WYWH and Numb. Personally, I'd love to see him do a cover or two. He never would on his own tour, but I'd be up for it."
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,dukemantee,7,Fri Jul 17 05:11:50 2015 UTC,"I expect several songs from On An Island, plus the whole new album, plus Louder Than Words. No Rick Wright so no Echoes."
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,buildabeast,2,Thu Jul 16 17:26:44 2015 UTC,Saw him a decade ago and it was a whole set of Floyd and then his entire new album. IMO he doesn't put on as good a show as Waters does but both are still amazing.
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,jorellano,2,Thu Jul 16 20:23:13 2015 UTC,"Really? I feel like without Gilmour's voice and guitar 90% of my favorite Floyd songs would be lacking... Oh well, to each their own.  Good luck with tix!"
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,PinkFloydJoe,9,Fri Jul 17 13:20:04 2015 UTC,He's playing Madison Square Garden? Holy crap!
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,ragby,4,Thu Jul 16 12:09:09 2015 UTC,Any tips on how best to use Ticketmaster to get tickets at MSG or Toronto?  I guess online is as good or better than phoning?
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,PinkFloydJoe,7,Thu Jul 16 14:09:58 2015 UTC,"When I buy tickets I usually have 3-4 computers set up on the Find Tickets page. There have been times when Ticketmaster crashes (the whole site!) because of so many requests for tickets at the same time. (This happened once to me on Live Nation when they put Foo Fighters tickets onsale with Ariana Grande tickets at the same exact fucking time)  Buying tickets online can be really stressful (for me at least), but as long as you have a couple computers set up you should be fine. At least he's playing large venues!"
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,ragby,6,Thu Jul 16 14:21:39 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip and the encouragement!  Good luck to everyone trying for tickets tomorrow!
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,UsNotThem,6,Thu Jul 16 16:02:15 2015 UTC,"I've always found that phoning the ticket sellers or the venue to be better to obtain tickets rather than going online.   But I live in the UK, so I don't know what the deal is like in the US."
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,Rooster_Ties,6,Thu Jul 16 14:35:26 2015 UTC,"Pretty risky calling.  Been years (eons) since I've bought tickets by phone, but as best I can recall -- you're on hold for as much as 10-20 minutes, and by that time, think of all the on-line transactions that have already been processed.  On-line is maybe a little risky, but maybe you try both -- get on the phone (and on hold), and also try by computer -- at the same time -- and whichever gets you in first, you go with that."
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,SgtWaffleStomp,7,Thu Jul 16 17:22:45 2015 UTC,Has anyone been able to find info on ticket prices for any of the US shows yet?
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,jorellano,3,Thu Jul 16 12:40:22 2015 UTC,Or presales? As with any show these days I see scalpers snatching these up in seconds...
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,Beezelbubba,4,Thu Jul 16 13:33:38 2015 UTC,"If you look how some of the shows were done in Europe, your name is on the ticket and you must present ID with the same name on entrance."
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,jorellano,3,Thu Jul 16 13:56:16 2015 UTC,"Nice, that's a cool feature. Now to scrounge up the $100's I'll need for decent seats..."
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,pinkfloydfan4life,2,Thu Jul 16 14:38:02 2015 UTC,"There doesn't appear to be any presales, not for New York anyway."
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,HotDogHell,7,Thu Jul 16 14:31:52 2015 UTC,CHICAAAAGO!
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,mreichman,5,Thu Jul 16 15:36:07 2015 UTC,That is how I'm feeling right now (in Milwaukee). I WILL be there.  It would be great to know when the tickets go on sale!
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,rolandboard,3,Thu Jul 16 20:02:59 2015 UTC,Minneapolis here...road trip it is.
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,dukemantee,7,Fri Jul 17 02:47:30 2015 UTC,"As a resident of Los Angeles, I'm stunned that DG would want to play the Hollywood Bowl in March. Contrary to popular belief it gets cold here in the winter sometimes. The chances that it will be in the low 50s - upper 40s that night are pretty high and that's rainy season too. Really poor planning IMO. He ought to play the Forum."
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,PinkFloydJoe,8,Thu Jul 16 17:04:52 2015 UTC,He was probably feeling nostalgic.  He seems to like that venue. They based the stage design of the 1994 tour off the Hollywood Bowl.
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,dukemantee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:13:37 2015 UTC,"I get that but man, March 24th. The chances that it will be cold and rainy that night are very high."
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,ShlappinDahBass,6,Thu Jul 16 17:17:42 2015 UTC,Hopefully he records it then. A rainy concert film is always badass
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,Megalandrys,4,Thu Jul 16 18:03:49 2015 UTC,"Also pretty bad for the guitars, but if they do it well, it's beyond badass."
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,hendrixpm,4,Thu Jul 16 20:47:08 2015 UTC,"Rainy? Do we live in the same city? It drizzles for about 20 minutes 8 times a year, we'll be fine."
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,dukemantee,5,Thu Jul 16 20:09:13 2015 UTC,"How's the sound at the Bowl now? Has it been updated in the past 10 years?  I left LA in 2004 and the only Bowl show I really enjoyed was Radiohead because I managed to get 3rd row seats. Otherwise, I was unimpressed. It is the bowl, and if you're into that sort of thing, you're bound to spot a celebrity or two, but sound-wise it wasn't my favorite venue.  You're right about the weather. Plenty of other venues in the area."
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,GamerTyke,2,Thu Jul 16 17:23:09 2015 UTC,"David will bring his own sound and I'm sure it will be as good as possible, but there are local ordinances about noise and I never feel the Bowl is loud enough for rock & roll, especially if you're sitting in the upper half. What's great and unique about the Bowl is the bottom half is all boxes with picnic tables and you are encouraged to bring your own food and drink. On a nice night you can have a great meal and see a show, the philharmonic, some jazz. But it's just not great for rock and especially if it's cold and damp."
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,PinkFloydJoe,5,Thu Jul 16 17:38:14 2015 UTC,"Location aside, which is the best venue on that list?"
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,GamerTyke,3,Thu Jul 16 12:45:02 2015 UTC,"Probably either the Hollywood Bowl or MSG. They both have more historic value to music history than the rest of the venues.  I wouldn't be surprised if he films his DVD at the Hollywood Bowl, or the RAH (like Remember That Night)."
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,climbon321,3,Thu Jul 16 15:38:10 2015 UTC,I'm thinking Hollywood Bowl since it'll be outside and I imagine the acoustics will be much better.
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,noel_105,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:48:49 2015 UTC,Hollywood Bowl redid their sound system within the last few years too.  It's leagues better than it used to be.
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,Beezelbubba,2,Fri Jul 17 17:42:14 2015 UTC,"The DVD will almost certainly be RAH, judging from the ticket prices of that show."
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,flamingllama33,2,Thu Jul 16 16:09:31 2015 UTC,3 Arenas and one amphitheater.  All larger places
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,jorellano,4,Thu Jul 16 14:15:06 2015 UTC,"I'm about 2-3 hours from Toronto, this might be my only chance ... Any idea on prices for that venue?"
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,Beezelbubba,5,Thu Jul 16 12:48:10 2015 UTC,"Gouge-arriffic. For Gilmour I'd imagine we're looking at 90-100 upper bowls, 150-200 lower bowl and 300+ for floors."
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,Beezelbubba,6,Thu Jul 16 13:32:20 2015 UTC,Last time he was in TO there were tickets that were ON the stage for $500 each.  He sold out 2-3 shows at Massey Hall instantly and that was 10 years ago

pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,Rooster_Ties,3,Thu Jul 16 16:28:55 2015 UTC,"This is totally a guess, but judging by the big gaps between the scheduled dates, it seems like they are planning to maybe do multiple nights in some of those venues and maybe the ticket sales will dictate if that happens."

pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,Rooster_Ties,20,Thu Jul 16 13:56:36 2015 UTC,Slim to none.  FTFY
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,AnarchicMuse,8,Thu Jul 16 13:59:13 2015 UTC,"Slim to none.   Less than none, really.  Unless Roger somehow repays the favor Dave did by playing Comfortably Numb on that one Wall show.  But the thing is, that was at Roger's request (and not something Dave was asking for at all).  I can't imagine Dave asking Roger to play on any of these dates.  I guess I can imagine Roger maybe suggesting it, but even that seems impossibly unlikely."
pinkfloyd,3dhu5j,rolandboard,9,Thu Jul 16 17:26:25 2015 UTC,"David's appearance at the Roger's Wall show in London was in exchange for Roger showing up for a charity gig a few months prior for David.  I do however agree with you that it is unlikely that Roger will show up at any of David's shows. Given what was said during a lot of The Endless River interviews, I feel like Pink Floyd really is a closed booked in Gilmour's life and that he just wants to focus on his own projects.  Inherently, people will still show up to Gilmour's concerts to hear Pink Floyd classics because given how huge of a band they were/are. It's a fair assumption and I don't think Gilmour would go as far as not performing any Pink Floyd songs as he still wrote/help write then and it would be almost foolish not to play some of his best work. Nonetheless, I still feel he is almost trying to disconnect himself from Pink Floyd career wise (not historically) because he wants people to listen to his new music as well and with Waters' showing up, I feel like it would defeat that whole purpose."

Edit: Single tix are still available, 2 together are not though, shit sucks.   Edit: I kept refreshing and I guess someone couldn't buy their tickets so they released them (after around 9 mins) and I got them! Sec 105, so word of advice, don't give up the first few mins!"

I'm only 24 and reading your analysis really put this song in a whole new light to me.  I mean, it was always one of my favorite Floyd songs, but this makes it even better and to me, makes it the key song (thematically) to The Division Bell."
pinkfloyd,3dj3a1,GusFringus,3,Thu Jul 16 18:11:44 2015 UTC,"This is my fourth favorite Pink Floyd song EVER. Absolutely perfect in ever single way.  The call and response vocals are brilliant. The way Gilmour's calm, growly voice contrast with the backup singers' crystal clear, shrill voices. It perfectly sets up a scene between a man and a woman going through communication troubles. It's probably my favorite use of backup singers in their catalog, aside from the ""Oohs and ahhs"" in Time.  Gilmour's guitar riff is catchy and creates a foreboding, yet adventurous, tone and the guitar solo is one of his best ever. It's just intense, raw, powerful, and ever so rockin'. Wright's keyboard solo is one of his best ever as well. It has such a neat, sci-fi feel to and the way it compliments Gilmour's guitar is brilliant. It's a true jam session.  Mason is the star of the show, though. His drumming is so fast, intense, unusually technical (for him, I think. I don't know a whole lot about this stuff), and it pumps me up so hard, no matter how many times I listen to it. It just sounds like he's having SO much fun jamming out and going nuts. I think 2:45 on is the best drumming of his career.  It's too bad the live version sucks, though. The guitar solo is better, but Wright's new solo just pales in comparison and Mason's drumming nowhere near as awesome."

It is pronounced ""dom-in-ay"", as /u/PinkFloydJoe quoted from Roger. Not only is this my knowledge and research, some random person on YouTube was proud he pronounced it right when he touched on it briefly on a rather recent interview.  So, if you don't believe my research and knowledge of Latin, believe that random anonymous person on YouTube.

pinkfloyd,3dfccc,InMyBrokenChair,8,Wed Jul 15 21:54:27 2015 UTC,"I wasn't overly hyped for this new album. I was excited, but not as excited as I thought I was going to be.   Until I saw this video. Once I heard him singing into that microphone, I had the biggest god damn grin on my face. I'm amazed that the guy is nearly 70 years old and can still sing and play guitar like that.   Roll on this new album and the 25th of September at the Royal Albert Hall! :D"

pinkfloyd,3dduii,InMyBrokenChair,2,Wed Jul 15 15:00:45 2015 UTC,Sounds 80's-ish
pinkfloyd,3dduii,gl77,2,Wed Jul 15 15:09:51 2015 UTC,"Which isn't necessarily bad.  There are a couple tracks on The Endless river that sound like throwbacks to either one of Dave's first two solo albums (kinda, sorta) -- both of which I love* -- so ""80's-ish"" isn't necessarily a bad thing, in my book.  Edit -- I love all of Dave's first solo album, and most of the second -- although when I actually listen to *About Face -- there are always 2 or 3 tracks I obviously remember as being a lot better than they really are.  Which is to say some of About Face hasn't aged as well as the rest of Dave's solo output.  (But it's Dave, so I still love most of it.)"
pinkfloyd,3dduii,Rooster_Ties,3,Wed Jul 15 16:28:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed. When the little snippets of TER first appeared, they sounded like cheesy 80's music or elevator music. A lot of people on here were making jokes about it. Myself included. Turns out the album was fantastic.  So you can't judge a book by it's cover, nor an album from a 5 second clip of one song."

pinkfloyd,3dduii,russianguy,7,Wed Jul 15 18:38:21 2015 UTC,The 70's Floyd sound is gone forever.  It's tough to come to terms with that fact but I guess we just have to accept it and enjoy what we have.

pinkfloyd,3dduii,Rooster_Ties,2,Wed Jul 15 16:26:51 2015 UTC,"Same here. All the ER teasers had me very worried indeed, but they didn't tell the story. I love Endless River. Here's hoping, coz this clip......"

pinkfloyd,3df08l,Megalandrys,6,Wed Jul 15 19:25:50 2015 UTC,"Sorrow is truly one of the hidden gems and my favourite from AMLOR! It really resonates with me the same way that much of The Division Bell does. But really, I'd be hard pressed to name more than five songs from Pink Floyd of any era that I honestly don't like. That's what I always found so astounding about Floyd: It's 70% AWESOME, 29% REALLY GOOD, and only 1% MEH. Which other band could claim that?"
pinkfloyd,3df08l,pluginmeerkat,4,Wed Jul 15 20:38:30 2015 UTC,"Sorrow's good, but ""High Hopes"" is by far the most Pink Floyd-sounding song of the post-Waters era to me"
pinkfloyd,3df08l,Blitzkrieg999,3,Wed Jul 15 22:23:12 2015 UTC,"Sorrow is a fantastic track, maybe the strongest on all of AMLOR.  While I agree it's very ""Pink Floyd sounding"" -- I also think it fits in quite well with the rest of Dave's solo catalog -- as well or better than nearly anything else on AMLOR would."
pinkfloyd,3df08l,Rooster_Ties,3,Wed Jul 15 19:44:12 2015 UTC,"I would have to say my favorites from this album is Learning To Fly and On The Turning Away, this one would be almost tied for 2nd."

pinkfloyd,3de28k,tommyball,4,Wed Jul 15 16:08:50 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you but when you have written and played some of the greatest music ever, and to have it all end the way it did, it is to be expected I would think.

In a lot of ways this was the final Floyd show that they did as a ""live"" rock band.  The Wall shows were all strictly choreographed and the 87-94 shows all were timed to films and lasers and such.  I realize film and the light show were around during the 70s tours, but the band stretched out.  A performance of a song from one night to the next had distinguishing features and it still had that ""live"" quality to it that on any given night (may 9th for example) the band could catch fire.  The Wall shows were certainly special in their own right.    It was the sound of a band.  Sure, Snowy was there and Dick played on a couple songs, but you were mainly hearing David, Roger, Rick, and Nick.  What special times."

A live Pink Floyd ""radio show"" featuring Jim Ladd, not only do you get Radio KAOS (I'm a fan, what can I say), but you get a lot of Floyd classics, as well. I can only imagine how awesome this concert would have been.  My only issue is the 80's rendition of some of the classic songs. It's all fine on Radio KAOS, because I was used to that, but songs like Money, Wish You Were Here, and Breathe are just so bad. Unnecessary saxophone solos, absolutely obnoxious brass instruments, and a stupid clarinet (I think) replacing Gilmour's signature twangy guitar in Wish You Were Here. It's cringeworthy.  For the most part, though, it's pretty cool. Me or Him and The Powers That Be sound awesome live."
pinkfloyd,3daay6,Rooster_Ties,5,Tue Jul 14 18:59:56 2015 UTC,"I've always thought these KAOS shows were kinda fun (dating back to when I first heard bootlegs of them back in the late 80's and early 90's), even if they aren't exactly my cup of tea (to put it both mildly, and politely).  I mean, I'm sure I could find a couple dozen things about them that aren't to my liking, but at the same time -- they are SO Roger, to the point that I don't even apply my usual Pink Floyd standards to judging them -- and I just enjoy them for what they are.  Full disclosure, I'm 'Team Dave' all the way -- but I also think Roger is entirely free to perform any and all Pink Floyd material however he chooses, and it is kinda neat to hear a different spin on things, by someone who legitimately ought to have the right to do whatever he wants with (and to) those songs.  Sure, I don't love 'em all, but it's Roger being Roger, and that's OK too."

If it had just been a ""mistake"" or ""oh well, that sure wasnt one of our best efforts, but lets keep it on the record anyway"", they surely wouldnt have gone and released it as a fucking single then.

pinkfloyd,3d5rqi,GamerTyke,3,Mon Jul 13 20:45:53 2015 UTC,It's part of why the climax around 17:00 is so rewarding - it grew out of nothing. I see the whales/wails as a kind of auditory negative space that contrasts with the intense musical landscape of the sonic explosion that comes later.
pinkfloyd,3d5rqi,andres9231,6,Mon Jul 13 21:07:10 2015 UTC,That was David Gilmour getting a little experimental with his electric guitar.  It's basically guitar feedback created using a Wah-Wah pedal.  Here's an example of it (watch the volume!)

pinkfloyd,3d5rqi,dodgersfan24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:36:18 2015 UTC,"You have to have an old circuit, the ones today usually don't reverse, however they have made some pedals that achieve this. The story is he accidentally rigged up his wah pedal in reverse and got different feedback from wah position and pickup configuration and volume. Feed that through a delay (his echorec) and control the tone knob and you got it. Volume at 10 on guitar too I think."
pinkfloyd,3d5rqi,gm4,7,Wed Jul 15 00:10:02 2015 UTC,"First time eh? Lucky, wish I could do it all over again, in time that sound you will learn to appreciate and it wont be so unpleasant. Analyze the lyrics, and listen to it over again, and again, it is a beautiful song."
pinkfloyd,3d5rqi,pinkfloydfan4life,4,Mon Jul 13 19:43:38 2015 UTC,I figured that may be the case.  I used to feel the same way about the clocks in Time. Now it's one of my favorites and I enjoy the part.
pinkfloyd,3d5rqi,MaxCHEATER64,3,Mon Jul 13 20:31:00 2015 UTC,"It's feedback meant to sound like a scream. Commonly referred to as ""the whales"".  It's part of the super extended buildup to the thirty second long solo around 17:00."

pinkfloyd,3d67vb,Megalandrys,6,Tue Jul 14 13:18:15 2015 UTC,Fat old sun must be Gilmour's best song. I think Water's best songwriting is on the Final Cut and his subsequent solo albums.
pinkfloyd,3d67vb,BamaDillert,6,Mon Jul 13 22:49:18 2015 UTC,And here I thought I had controversial opinions :p
pinkfloyd,3d67vb,GroovingPict,3,Mon Jul 13 22:55:15 2015 UTC,"The Final Cut was probably the worst musically out of all Pink Floyd's albums, but it's lyrics were very refined - not as flowery as in Meddle, not as awkward or directionless as in Saucerful of Secrets, not as simple as in DSOTM - they're concise and present fluidly and eloquently emotion better than any of the previous albums could, even if the music is comparatively lackluster. It's not my favorite album, but I can't help but admire Roger's improvement from his older works."
pinkfloyd,3d67vb,BamaDillert,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:09:01 2015 UTC,"Definitely not the worst musically, but I get most people don't like it. I hated it then fell in love with it, and I think it's my favorite Gilmour guitar tone."

pinkfloyd,3d67vb,NachoFresard,8,Wed Jul 15 21:29:01 2015 UTC,"Roger- Time. Songs like Dogs, Comfortably Numb, and The Final Cut come close, but I think Time is his best. If we were counting solo stuff, the song Amused To Death would come close as well.  David- Of the songs he wrote alone, Sorrow. If we're counting lyrics he cowrote, then High Hopes.  It sucks that, on A Momentary Lapse, David co-wrote a number of songs, and we don't know if the other writers wrote lyrics or music or both. Jon Carin once said David wrote 95% of the lyrics on A Momentary Lapse of Reason, but for sake of argument we'll discount those songs he cowrote."
pinkfloyd,3d67vb,InMyBrokenChair,5,Mon Jul 13 23:33:30 2015 UTC,Roger: Nobody Home  David: Fat Old Sun
pinkfloyd,3d67vb,Raisedkaine,3,Mon Jul 13 23:39:52 2015 UTC,"That's a tough one. It's tough (impossible) to name Roger's best, because there are so many good ones; in his prime probably the best lyricist there was. It's tough to name David's cause, what do you and do you not count as David's? Do you count those he cowrote with Polly? Do you count those he cowrote with other people? How much did he write of those lyrics and how much did the other person(s) contribute with? It's difficult to say.  For Barrett, it is easier (in my view anyway), but perhaps it will seem controversial to some: Effervescing Elephant. Now hold on, hear me out. This piece is often just dismissed as some childlike ditty with fun words that rhyme and roll satisfyingly off the tongue, but with no deeper meaning. It is in fact heavy on social commentary and steeped in metaphor, and the fact that he wrote it when he was only 16 makes it even more impressive. Bob Dylan Blues in a close second; not only a brilliantly satirical song about Bob Dylan, but even written in Bob Dylan's style at the time. Again an early composition as well (apparently written after he and David had been to see Dylan in the early '60s, but that may be apocryphal)  Probably Summer '68 for Rick. (also nice trumpet work by Rick on that one ;) )."

Most of the the big acts 0f the 60's, 70's and 80's played on one side of the Atlantic or the other. There was a lot of great music played by music's biggest names. Look up Queen at Live Aid. That was probably the pinnacle of synchronicity between a band and its audience. After that set, Queen stood on top of the rock and roll mountain."

pinkfloyd,3d2glr,GroovingPict,4,Mon Jul 13 00:09:49 2015 UTC,"The original performance from 1968 is quite different from the 1970-71 performances, and much shorter as well.  It was apparently originally intended for Ummagumma, but didnt make it on. Which might seem strange, but if you hear this 1968 version it is pretty apparent why: it has too similar a sound to Grantchester Meadows, and they didnt need two such songs on such an album which was intended to give each member half a record side to experiment on, and had it been kept on as well as Grantchester Meadows, then we most likely would have missed out on one of the greatest, if not the greatest, Floyd pieces ever conceived, namely Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving With a Pict (The Embryo would need to go on Roger's part of the album, as it is written by him, and together with Grantchester Meadows he wouldve had two more or less identical sounding songs and nothing else. Undoubtedly the right decision was made).  Now, the later, 1970-71 renditions of The Embryo would perhaps fit more on an album such as Atom Heart Mother, and in my opinion at least could have favourably traded place with Alan's Psychedlic Breakfast for a place on the album. But others will no doubt disagree."

Some very nice tracks on Music From The Body, such as Breathe, which starts with the same words as the more famous Floyd song with the same name released a few years later. Give Birth to a Smile is also very nice, and has uncredited appearance by the rest of the Floyd. Then there are the more weird tracks, such as Our Song and More Than Seven Dwarfs in Penis Land.

pinkfloyd,3d36a4,Freddies_Mercury,3,Mon Jul 13 11:25:25 2015 UTC,"Someone did, I believe.  Here are some pre-recordings for the album, and here was a tracklist someone put together combining the two albums and movie music, that I believe I may work on soon."
pinkfloyd,3d36a4,Megalandrys,6,Mon Jul 13 14:37:47 2015 UTC,"Some are about the teacher from The Wall. It was originally going to be called Spare Bricks because a lot of the songs were left over from The Wall. That might have been a better name because the album doesn't really have one focused theme. Roger/Pink's dad, Margaret Thatcher/Falklands War, the teacher, Pink's epilogue. They don't tie together well. I still love the album, though."
pinkfloyd,3d36a4,InMyBrokenChair,10,Mon Jul 13 04:11:59 2015 UTC,"They all do have one uniting theme, though. War. Roger toys with the concept of war and what it means in so much of his work, but The Final Cut is entirely about it. Even the title song, which has the least references to war itself, is about Roger's own suicidal thoughts; A neurosis keenly felt because he grew up without a father. His father, the teacher, himself, all of us are effected by this warmachine called the industrial war complex. And Maggy and Ronny kept it chugging in the 80s, when it was most likely we'd be seeing ""Two Suns in the Sunset"".  To me, it's his most hauntingly beautiful work. Masterpiece of an album."
pinkfloyd,3d36a4,djkalteraphine,8,Mon Jul 13 04:43:51 2015 UTC,"I think the Final Cut really tackles the political issues beyond the wall, so yeah war is definitely one of the biggest themes in the album"
pinkfloyd,3d36a4,__________________l,2,Mon Jul 13 05:19:08 2015 UTC,"I mean... it is subtitled ""A Requiem for the Post-War Dream""..."

pinkfloyd,3d36a4,KIMrPickle,5,Mon Jul 13 18:18:16 2015 UTC,"The title track always sounded so similar to ""Comfortably Numb"" to me. The keyboard line behind the guitar solo especially. The lyrics (and to a lot of other songs on ""TFC"") make me think of the unique perspective of a pre-breakdown / pre-hotel room protagonist from ""The Wall"""
pinkfloyd,3d36a4,djarumgreen,4,Mon Jul 13 12:51:15 2015 UTC,What happened to the post war dream?:(
pinkfloyd,3d36a4,BlazeSoul,2,Mon Jul 13 13:54:31 2015 UTC,"Not really. It was one of two demos he brought to the band. It apparently follows the narrative of the ""Teacher"". Used to not like it, now I love it, I think it might be my favorite guitar tone Gilmour ever achieved. Super raw and powerful and right in your face.  edit: I'm sorry, my first sentence was slightly untrue, the other full demo was pros and cons, although these were part of the, in a way, ""rejected demos"" for the Wall."
pinkfloyd,3d36a4,gm4,3,Mon Jul 13 15:47:03 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love it as well, just found it on vinyl the other day very good condition for $10, I can't understand why is the least favorite among fans."
pinkfloyd,3d36a4,Megalandrys,2,Mon Jul 13 16:20:16 2015 UTC,"I told my English/Lit teacher a while back, since we're mutual fans, about how Roger would bash AMLoR through The Division Bell, and he said that all of those comments ""could be said about The Final Cut as well"" and I was like ""but... the title track... ""Your Possible Pasts""... ""The Hero's Return""... ""Not Now John""... ""Two Suns in the Sunset""... why, man, why?""  My TFC has one scratch on it (may have been from me, who knows), perfect everything else, $18."
pinkfloyd,3d36a4,Megalandrys,2,Mon Jul 13 17:05:39 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I tried reading it over and I don't get it, he bashed AMLoR through TDB?"

pinkfloyd,3d36a4,Megalandrys,2,Mon Jul 13 18:38:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think your teacher either hadn't listened, or just is pretty bad at judging music. I would take the Final Cut over AMLOR for sure, and a good chunk of Division Bell. As a Gilmour-obsessive I am glad DB exists, but I won't kid myself with my true preference."
pinkfloyd,3d36a4,gm4,2,Mon Jul 13 20:22:28 2015 UTC,"It's sort of like Rumours by Fleetwood Mac. That was a bloody great album, written in a terrible time for the band. Personally I don't see why this one isn't viewed the same, but I guess it's overshadowed by The Wall achieving that same thing."
pinkfloyd,3d36a4,Megalandrys,2,Mon Jul 13 16:01:14 2015 UTC,"I honestly think people just aren't really listening to it. The transition into The Final Cut is one of the sweetest moments in the Pink Floyd canon, and some of Waters' best singing in my opinion, especially since you can hear him go back to ""If"" which is especially heart-breaking knowing this is the last full band album. And again, tear-jerking Gilmour playing, and that solo is incredibly short."
pinkfloyd,3d36a4,gm4,2,Mon Jul 13 16:29:03 2015 UTC,"Well, it wasn't the last full band album. Rick was kicked out before The Wall was released, I believe. His contributions were so minimal there, I'm not sure I'd call that the last full band album. Animals at worst.  But I agree with everything else, haha."
pinkfloyd,3d36a4,medeiros420,2,Mon Jul 13 17:03:05 2015 UTC,"True, but the Final Cut was pretty dry and orchestrated so even if that hadn't happened I don't think Rick would have a huge contribution anyway, and plus no one seemed to have a problem with Rick playing live. In fact he was the only one making money from the Wall tour ironically. Hell David came in and played for the earlier demos for TFC and so far it seems like those are the same tracks used on the finished album."
pinkfloyd,3d36a4,OfAnthony,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:29:45 2015 UTC,"what i have read about The Final Cut was that the album was about the life of Pink's father. In The Wall they tell u that he died in war, but you dont hear about him no more, just pink's pain for loosing him. In The Final Cut album the color in the bottom are the medals soldiers win in the world war II. if u notice the story behind the wall is about the life Roger Waters was feeling he had and The Final Cut is more about the war, like in ""two suns in the sunset"" (the sun itself and the explosions). Waters also dedicated the album that was provisionally titled “Requiem for a Post-War Dream” to his father, Eric Fletcher Waters who died in World War II."
pinkfloyd,3d4q4t,jarfIy,6,Mon Jul 13 14:41:03 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but this is 100% fake. The drums are obviously sampled, and they didn't have that kind of technology when this was supposedly recorded.   This was clearly recorded digitally. If this really was an unreleased Pink Floyd track, it would've been recorded on Tape, and the noise level of the recording would be significantly higher.  Secondly, you can hear the guitar buzz and someone shuffling around during the fade out.  Finally, the original uploader (www.jackieppoo.tumblr.com) keeps changing what year the track is from. First they said 1974, and then they switched it to 1969, and now they just leave the year blank?   Yeah, I'm calling BS."
pinkfloyd,3d4q4t,PinkFloydJoe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:22:33 2015 UTC,"No argument regarding the sampling and tape noise - personally, I can't tell the drums are sampled, but I'll take your word for it. I also thought the same thing about the lack of tape noise.   Buuut, if you actually click on that link that references 1974 (using the cache), you can actually see it's a different upload all together. Here's a direct link: http://jimmy-paganism.tumblr.com/post/77001455875/jackie-p-poo-unreleased-pink-floyd-track-from   Not sure if that's any less suspect (perhaps even more so), just throwing it out there."
pinkfloyd,3d4q4t,PinkFloydJoe,2,Mon Jul 13 15:46:30 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I didn't notice that they were two different tracks. That second track doesn't sound anymore like a real Pink Floyd recording then the first one, though.  The sad thing is that these sound like good demos!  If the uploader took as much effort polishing the recordings as they did misleading people, they might actually have a good batch of songs to release as their own!"

pinkfloyd,3d0twa,JinAnkabut,3,Mon Jul 13 03:57:11 2015 UTC,"Truly. I really like A Saucerful of Secrets as well (I feel that's a pretty unpopular opinion, sadly.). Both are bloody amazing albums. Piper had a bigger contribution by Syd, with great vocals and psychedelic music/lyrics, but ASoS has a unique charm as well, and the psychedelic edge. Hard to describe without restating Piper's charm, but it's... strange."
pinkfloyd,3d0twa,shabbyj,4,Mon Jul 13 04:04:18 2015 UTC,Very true. I always wished Floyd went back and did a full-on psychedelic album around the Animals-period. Their musicianship was top-notch and they were masters of their fancy electronics. Imagine what they could've come up with O_o
pinkfloyd,3d0twa,hear_now,2,Mon Jul 13 04:13:48 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't think it could've been the same without at least the slightest contribution from Syd. He did play on two songs, and ""Jugband Blues"" was basically his song and his song only. Without him, that album wouldn't be the same. Still though, I agree. Between DSotM and Animals, they probably could've pulled on a great psychedelic album, but I doubt it would've had that Syd feel that makes Piper and ASoS stand out (but it definitely would've been far from terrible, at that point)."

pinkfloyd,3d0twa,rogerwatersbitch,2,Mon Jul 13 05:44:33 2015 UTC,Its kind of a concept album in a sense that all the songs seem to transition into a new style. Like they meddled with their limits to see what they can pull off.

pinkfloyd,3d38j5,BamaDillert,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:34:15 2015 UTC,Zabriskie Point wasn't unreleased...?
pinkfloyd,3d38j5,MaxCHEATER64,2,Mon Jul 13 13:52:13 2015 UTC,"There was a Zabriskie Point soundtrack released in 1970, which featured some of Pink Floyd's music as well as some other musicians'. There was a good deal of material that Pink Floyd did record but was left off the final soundtrack album. These tracks were never officially released, but circulate as bootlegs. A user here put together an 'Zabriskie Point' album with only Pink Floyd songs on it - comprised of both the officially released tracks and some unreleased studio outtakes. So it's a bit 'yes and no'; not all the tracks from the Zabriskie Point sessions were released officially."
pinkfloyd,3d38j5,BamaDillert,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:35:28 2015 UTC,"The unreleased tracks from the original soundtrack were eventually released, though. The 1997 rerelease of the soundtrack included all of the unreleased material except ""The Violent Sequence,"" which if I remember correctly was later included on the immersion box of The Dark Side of the Moon."
pinkfloyd,3d38j5,Megalandrys,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:31:18 2015 UTC,"The original release had 3 Floyd songs: ""Heart Beat, Pig Meat"", ""Crumbling Land"", and ""Come in Number 51, Your Time is Up"".   The 1997 release contained four more tracks from Floyd, and four from Jerry Garcia. Floyd's tracks were ""Country Song"", ""Unknown Song"", ""Love Scene (Version 6)"", and ""Love Scene Version 4)"".   The majority of the material was released officially, I suppose. But there are some other tracks which have not been released at all, though, including ""Fingal's Cave"", ""Rain in the Country"", ""Take Off, Version II"", and ""Oenone"". There were also several alternate takes found on the unofficial ""Zabriskie Point Sessions"" bootleg."
pinkfloyd,3d38j5,ChuckEye,2,Mon Jul 13 21:29:51 2015 UTC,"""Silas Lane"", ""Lucy Leave"", and ""I'm A King Bee"", besides the two below. I believe I posted those three and ""Scream Thy Last Scream"" to Soundcloud (ripped off my Syd Barrett bootleg) a while back.  Edit: https://soundcloud.com/megalandrys if you want a listen"
pinkfloyd,3d38j5,GroovingPict,2,Mon Jul 13 05:05:38 2015 UTC,"I've heard of their soundtrack to a film called The Committee, but I don't know if it was new tracks or rehashes of existing material."

pinkfloyd,3d1xix,PinkFloydJoe,3,Sun Jul 12 23:27:47 2015 UTC,"Nothing has been confirmed, but I would assume there would be an option to watch the concert only without the documentary parts. It would be a big mistake not to. I'm sure they'll announce it within the coming months."
pinkfloyd,3d181k,PinkFloydBot,2,Sun Jul 12 18:00:23 2015 UTC,"Great song. This is a song that you could fall asleep to, with the build-up of background vocals against Gilmour's lullaby-ish guitar and voice. It's definitely a beautiful song and one of the reasons I adore Dave."

Sad but true. Fortunately I've seen Floyd in 1994 and Water a couple years ago so I can live with it.

pinkfloyd,3cvy54,nutshells,2,Sat Jul 11 05:50:58 2015 UTC,"Hello, Mixer here. I'd like to address some of your concerns considering it's my job to make the songs sound cohesive (quite a feat!)  I'm using sound effects to transition from song to song when there isn't an already cohesive transition available. Here's an example of how Pigs (Three Different Ones) transitions into Comfortably Numb. I used the effects from Bring The Boys Back Home to make the switch comfortable.  Great Gig and Shine On actually transfer pretty amazingly if you ask me... It's the dynamics of the crescendo that makes it work really well.  With Shine On 6-9 and Run Like Hell I used an interlude of Roger talking from the live version, which works really well.  With Run Like Hell and Another Brick In The Wall I used Happiest Days of Our Lives as the transition song  You get the idea? I have a good idea of what I'm doing here. If you have any other concerns I'd love to know!"
pinkfloyd,3cvy54,PinkFloydJoe,2,Sun Jul 12 02:26:13 2015 UTC,"I would argue that although musically, yes the Shine On 6-9 to Run Like Hell transitions works nice, when it comes to the tone it doesn't fit. It's going from the calm, sort of sad, synthesizer ending of Shine On where part of See Emily Play is played, to the rough, gritty edge of The Wall and Roger yelling ""IS THERE ANYONE HERE WHO'S WEAK?""   That Pigs to Comfortably Numb transition is really well done though."

Though I guess there is nothing wrong with putting it anywhere else in the album, in terms of actual music. I think it would need to have a shorter solo which is a little disappointing to fans."

pinkfloyd,3cszlf,Megalandrys,2,Thu Jul 16 22:58:40 2015 UTC,"/u/InMyBrokenChair 1   With the albums we have in this compilation, this one fits well, having no front title or band name, and has thematic artwork. (It being by a Pink Floyd album cover designer, in a way, does help.)   /u/PinkFloydJoe    The ripples/echoes, and the great mixing of covers, complete with again no front title or band name makes for a great cover as well.   /u/vector_control 1   It makes me sad to put this at third, because the artwork and text is plain beautiful. Sadly, the title turns me off just a little too much. As well as the fact that it's more original, maybe a little Meddle inspired, artwork, rather than thematic or a compilation, like the above."

pinkfloyd,3cvhhq,pinkfloydfan4life,0,Sat Jul 11 15:01:31 2015 UTC,"Did you even read the source you linked?  I'll paraphrase for you:  rick has always denied having a drug proble.  He noted that cocaine was a social drug in the 80s.  http://i.imgur.com/yVlw4Q7.png  Just because they used it socially DOES NOT MEAN THEY HAD A PROBLEM, NOR DOES IT MEAN IT CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR GREAKING UP.  Stop making outrageous claims."
pinkfloyd,3cvhhq,tommyball,3,Sat Jul 11 15:10:50 2015 UTC,Please show me where cocaine has ever had a positive inpact on ones mental or physical health.
pinkfloyd,3cvhhq,tanukis_parachute,3,Sat Jul 11 17:51:28 2015 UTC,"I looked some things up and found this in Mark Blake's Pigs Might Fly:  1972, DSOTM ""Cocaine would find its way onto the subsequent tour, but there was, by all accounts, none of it in the studio - only the occasional joint.""  1980, The Wall ""Subsequently, persistent rumours would circulate that cocaine use was also to blame for Wright’s de-parture. ‘There were people who were doing a lot of drugs,’ Waters told writer Sylvie Simmons. ‘Some of us had big, big problems. Though I wasn’t taking drugs at that point.’  Wright has always disputed any rumours that he had a cocaine problem. ‘I can honestly say that it really was not a drug problem,’ he said in 1999, while admitting that cocaine was taken socially by all band members during the time in which the band was making The Wall."" (put in bold by me)  ""‘I got carried away with the cocaine lifestyle,’ Gilmour later explained. ‘I thought the coke made me more loquacious, but the reality was rather more awful."""

pinkfloyd,3ctsla,josephbraun99,5,Fri Jul 10 18:41:53 2015 UTC,"Well when Syd heard Shine on You Crazy Diamond at Abbey Road in 1975, he said it sounded ""rather old"". I don't know about how he would've felt about their music in his state of mental instability, but under normal circumstances he probably would've enjoyed their change in direction. His music probably would've eventually evolved too, had he continued the way he was going with Piper at the Gates of Dawn.  I would extrapolate that if Syd continued making music he would've sounded a lot like a more psychedelic David Bowie perhaps."
pinkfloyd,3ctsla,PinkFloydJoe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:42:40 2015 UTC,I can see him going the Marc bolan route. Granted Marc was hugely influenced by Syd do is not really a stretch.
pinkfloyd,3ctsla,bolanrox,5,Sat Jul 11 16:10:39 2015 UTC,"It's easy to think of Pink Floyd in terms of the dichotomy Syd vs. post-Syd, but if you look at their early post- albums and concerts, The Syd influence was pretty strong. A great example is the Man and the Journey show.    Even though the band found its new identity, and went in a new direction, it wasn't uninformed by the past. I think he resonated through their work all the way to the end. For instance, the character of Pink is not Syd, but he contains a shard of him, for sure.  I think if Syd could have the benefit of reasonable hindsight, he'd probably be very proud of what his old bandmates accomplished."
pinkfloyd,3ctsla,YourHostandNarrator,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:18:40 2015 UTC,"but if you look at their early post- albums and concerts, The Syd influence was pretty strong   Well, Gilmour literally started as a replacement for Syd and learned by playing Syd-licks. It's only natural they started from that area before finding their own sound."
pinkfloyd,3ctsla,Gaminic,2,Sat Jul 11 00:20:56 2015 UTC,"I didn't know Syd personally but from what I can tell I don't think he would have had any true resentment if he wasn't insane. Well first and foremost he would not have left the band, I really don't know how to answer this question, other than I think he would have been a genuine person with no kind of ill will if he was sane and left the band. Just my opinion though..."

pinkfloyd,3cowux,andres92,-2,Fri Jul 10 00:55:16 2015 UTC,But the experience of seeing Roger live vs on a screen is completely different. $300 is a no brainer to see the man himself in person.. But $18 is a bit steep for the movie theater.. Especially knowing that whenever it's out on blu-ray it'll probably only be like $25

pinkfloyd,3cov77,GroovingPict,4,Thu Jul 9 16:19:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as I believe you pointed out before, it's highly about Waters, and what Waters felt he would become if he completed his Wall and cut himself off from society. But, when it gets to that part in the story, that vision of himself is heavily influenced by Syd, I'd say. Geldof's acting seems more influenced by Syd, but the character of Pink was mostly about Roger, just the little idiosyncrasies Barrett had influence the character in the third side onwards.   Now that I think about it, the concert where he views himself as a dictator is mostly about Waters, but I think the whole idea of, in reality, being on stage at a concert, but having no idea what you're doing, stems from Barrett's actions on stage in late '67-early/mid '68."
pinkfloyd,3cov77,Megalandrys,3,Thu Jul 9 16:27:28 2015 UTC,"Also, there is a kind of thing where Pink shaves off his hair and eyebrows. I imagine that was based off how Syd looked when he came to the recording studio during Wish You Were Here."
pinkfloyd,3cov77,KIMrPickle,3,Thu Jul 9 17:07:25 2015 UTC,"Well, as others have said, Roger.  He was even set to play Pink at first.  ""The film was going to star Waters himself.[7] EMI did not intend to make the film, as they did not understand the concept.[8]  Director Alan Parker, a Pink Floyd fan, asked EMI whether The Wall could be adapted to film. EMI suggested that Parker talk to Waters, who had asked Parker to direct the film. Parker instead suggested that he produce it and give the directing task to Gerald Scarfe and Michael Seresin, a cinematographer.[9] Waters began work on the film's screenplay after studying scriptwriting books. He and Scarfe produced a special-edition book containing the screenplay and art to pitch the project to investors. While the book depicted Waters in the role of Pink, after screen tests, he was removed from the starring role[10] and replaced with punk musician and frontman of the Boomtown Rats, Bob Geldof.[7] In Behind the Wall, both Waters and Geldof later admitted to a story during casting where Geldof and his manager took a taxi to an airport, and Geldof's manager pitched the role to the singer, who continued to reject the offer and express his contempt for the project throughout the fare, unaware that the taxi driver was Waters' brother, who promptly proceeded to tell Waters about Geldof's opinion.""  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd_%E2%80%93_The_Wall  See the Development section for more info."

You can have anything you want  You can drift, you can dream, even walk on water  Anything you want   Describing Waters' total control of the band during the recording of The Wall.

But I never really dug Piper entirely for a number of years, and even then, different tunes took different amounts of time to really click with me.  I've never clicked with any of Syd's solo work, but the Syd-penned Floyd tunes have all improved over time with me, definitely - over the course of 10 and 15 years, in some cases."

pinkfloyd,3clzlh,scaryketchup,4,Thu Jul 9 14:10:55 2015 UTC,I've gotten most of my Pink Floyd vinyl for less than or equal to $15. Once I found a 1st UK pressing of Relics for $45 at a store doing a half off all used vinyl special making it around $22.
pinkfloyd,3clzlh,Megalandrys,3,Wed Jul 8 23:26:10 2015 UTC,"I got WYWH for $15 when the retail is $40, or so the store claims anyway. My The Wall was $32, but I'm not sure how good that is. Then I got The Final Cut and a Syd Barrett bootleg for $18 each.  I'm not well-versed in the prices, but that's all I've got, so."
pinkfloyd,3clzlh,Megalandrys,2,Wed Jul 8 23:23:53 2015 UTC,"Eh, depends on the pressing/condition. My WYWH was for $20 but it wasn't in amazing condition."
pinkfloyd,3clzlh,elroy_,2,Thu Jul 9 01:06:58 2015 UTC,"It was pretty good, the only problem was the one scratch in the last minutes of Shine On VI-IX. Since then it's gained a couple more, I don't know how but around the fifth time I played it, nothing bad happening to the record other than just playing it, it gained two more scratches a bit after the first, and the grooves in the middle of ""Have A Cigar"" are messed up, so it skips the first few words of the second verse (saying that from the ""Come in here dear boy"" to ""We call it riding the gravy train"" is one verse) and a good chunk of the playing immediately before.  So, when I first got it, it was in very good condition, but not mint. Now it's just at a good level; while I love ""Have a Cigar"", I love all the other songs a little more, so it's not so much a devastating loss as though there were a scratch on side 1, or in ""Wish You Were Here"". Doesn't kill my vibe. The scratches in Shine On VI-IX just add to the novelty for me, plus it isn't hard to make the music play without it looping like it does, if you know how.  Sort of related story: My The Wall has a scratch in ""Young Lust"" (not sure for how long, but I can't remember listening to it without it looping) at a very particular part, and the loop it makes actually is pretty good, and the first time I heard the actual song, I was shocked at how it actually went; I was so used to hearing it loop a couple times before it went back higher."

Then they are most likely bootlegs and not worth the money (or any money in my opinion). Unless the Ummagumma is the Japanese issue on red vinyl, then for the love of god get off your ass right now and go buy it. But more likely than not they are both bootleg issues."
pinkfloyd,3ckqr9,GroovingPict,2,Wed Jul 8 18:07:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry should have clarified, there were two AHM in red and pink, Ummagumma was just a regular copy."
pinkfloyd,3ckqr9,GroovingPict,2,Wed Jul 8 18:27:49 2015 UTC,"Ah ok. Well, again, the AHM's are most likely bootlegs. Unless, again, the red vinyl version is the Japanese issue on red Everclean vinyl, in which case it is definitely worth the price if it's in nice condition and has the obi strip intact (even without the obi, really). (even though AHM seems to be the most common of the Japanese Pink Floyd red vinyl issues... at least it's the one I see pop up most often, and the only one I own myself). Off the top of my head I dont think AHM was ever released on pink vinyl, in any country (I could be wrong), so that's a bootleg then. Which, I guess, makes it more likely that the red vinyl one is also just a bootleg (where there's one there's likely more). Would need more info, preferably pictures, to tell for sure. Personally I wouldnt buy a bootleg version of an official album even if the price was $1, but Im not you and now at least you have the information to make an informed decision on your own and decide if something like that is worth that money to you (some people gladly fork over that kind of money knowing full well they are buying a bootleg issue and that it is bound to sound sub par... and who am I to call those people insane..........)  As for Ummagumma, it depends entirely on which issue it is and what condition it is in, whether or not it's worth $50. If you have the opportunity to take and post some photos of it, particularly the labels, I could help you with that. There are issues that would definitely be worth the price, and there are issues that would definitely not."

pinkfloyd,3ck2rs,mrw412,2,Wed Jul 8 16:30:06 2015 UTC,"Forget the immense length of The Wall, and no songs had to be taken out in order to have a longer CN. Would you still keep it the same?"
pinkfloyd,3ck2rs,mrw412,4,Wed Jul 8 16:33:59 2015 UTC,"Of course, would love to hear it recorded in the studio with Roger and David."
pinkfloyd,3ck2rs,andres9231,4,Wed Jul 8 16:37:22 2015 UTC,How about this version? Kind of a happy medium.  https://youtu.be/t-ZIWMRDmms?t=1h7m55s
pinkfloyd,3ck2rs,GamerTyke,8,Wed Jul 8 17:01:20 2015 UTC,PULSE for sure. The fact that solo fades out on the album is fucking criminal.
pinkfloyd,3ck2rs,Megalandrys,2,Wed Jul 8 15:36:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I said to my friend once that I wish the solo was longer since I could hear the fade out. He's like dude, go listen to the Pulse version NOW"
pinkfloyd,3ck2rs,pedronicolau,2,Wed Jul 8 16:29:00 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like the fadeout more than the 'big' finish in ""Comfortably Numb""'s case, because it fits better on the album that way, in my opinion."
pinkfloyd,3ck2rs,pinkfloydfan4life,2,Wed Jul 8 18:06:09 2015 UTC,The synergy with the public in the PULSE also gives 'em a nice intuition with the music!

In relation to lyrics, Pink Floyd really makes me love songs that tell stories and tales as well as themes and symbols. Songs outside Pink Floyd that I personally find influenced by this are some like Ball and Chain by Social Distortion and Space Oddity by David Bowie."
pinkfloyd,3cj3ra,Megalandrys,2,Wed Jul 8 08:48:28 2015 UTC,"David Bowie did say he was influenced by Syd Barrett and early Pink Floyd, so!"
pinkfloyd,3cj3ra,Endxsor,10,Wed Jul 8 18:16:48 2015 UTC,"They have also taught me how music can relate to lyrics, and finding symbols and themes. My interest in these lyrics drew me to prog-rock, and now its my favorite sub-genre in music. I just love the themes that are shown in prog, how they're written, and how well the music can accompany it. They got me into bands like King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Van der graaf Generator, etc."
pinkfloyd,3cj3ra,maakuz,20,Wed Jul 8 14:27:04 2015 UTC,It drew me further out of my metal shell. Trying to enjoy more diverse music now.

It's only now that I listen to songs by other artists and just stop and think 'that makes no sense, these are just random words', or in better cases I stop to actually enjoy a really nice line.   Also, the themes of their songs. Nearly everything I hear on the radio or even in my own playlists is about something like relationships or easy to write scenarios similar to that. Pink Floyd were diverse in what they sang about, usually relating to existential things such as time, belonging e.t.c Time is a masterclass of songwriting, and it has actually made me think, which is hard to do in any art form."
pinkfloyd,3cj3ra,scaryketchup,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:08:56 2015 UTC,"Like others have mentioned, lyrics have become so much more important.

pinkfloyd,3cj3ra,CrustyJim,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:32:18 2015 UTC,"I think it made me more appreciate ideas behind whole albums. Like how dark side is about lunacy and the wall is... the wall.

And I never knew the moon could be so big And I never knew the moon could be so blue And I'm grateful that you threw away my old shoes And brought me here instead dressed in red And I'm wondering who could be writing this song.

pinkfloyd,3ci8m2,Esperanzan,7,Wed Jul 8 03:24:17 2015 UTC,"Hell. You could go all the way back to Obscured by Clouds...  Free Four (Waters) 4:15   The memories of a man in his old age Are the deeds of a man in his prime. You shuffle in gloom of the sickroom And talk to yourself as you die.  Life is a short, warm moment And death is a long cold rest. You get your chance to try in the twinkling of an eye: Eighty years, with luck, or even less.  So all aboard for the American tour, And maybe you'll make it to the top. And mind how you go, and I can tell you, 'cause I know You may find it hard to get off.  You are the angel of death And I am the dead man's son. And he was buried like a mole in a fox hole. And everyone is still in the run.  And who is the master of fox hounds? And who says the hunt has begun? And who calls the tune in the courtroom? And who beats the funeral drum?  The memories of a man in his old age Are the deeds of a man in his prime.

Dark Side is basically the different aspects of life that turn this kid (Pink) into an angry, bitter man. Wish You Were Here/Animals is about his journey into the music industry and the impact that has on him, as well as an extension of the bitterness instilled in him. The Wall is... well, you know that one. It's more intricate than that, obviously. There's a story. But that's the basic idea.  Never going to happen, though."

How her golden hair was blowing wild. Then she spread her wings to fly, For to fly.  Soaring high above the breezes, Going always where she pleases. She will make it to the island in the sun. I will follw in her shadow As I watch her from my window. One day I will catch her eye.  She is calling from the deep, Summoning my soul to endless sleep. She is bound to drag me down, Drag me down."

There is so much going on in this song you could write a dissertation about it (actually it probably has been already).  Also a great ending for the little group of songs starting with ""One of my Turns""."
pinkfloyd,3cg9q1,hannibellecter,4,Tue Jul 7 19:01:58 2015 UTC,"This was written by Roger in a huff, in a single evening. There had been some arguing in the studio, with the other members saying there werent enough good songs on the album (well why dont you fucking write one then David you whiner... anyway, carrying on). Roger got in a pissy ""well Im taking my ball and going home then"" mood, and, to quote David, ""then he returned the next day with this fantastic piece"". Makes you wish people would call his songs not good more often ;)  Plenty of Syd references in this one. Gohills boots, elastic bands keeping his shoes on, Hendrix perm, etc.  Bob Ezrin plays the piano on this (Rick on the prophet-5 synth).  David plays the bass on this (Roger doing vocals and ""playing"" the VCS3).  TV dialog heard is from episode 97 (Season 4, episode 7) of Gomer Pyle, USMC (on the album version, not the movie version linked to in this post; more on that below). Youtube link to relevant part. It seems to be going in the background throughout the entire song, but most of it obviously drowned out by the song itself. The parts that can at least be vaguely heard are as follows:  Sgt Carter: ""Alright, I'll take care of him part of the time, but there's somebody else that needs taking care of in Washington."" Corporal Boyd: ""Who's that?"" SC: ""Rose Pilchik!"" CB: ""Rose Pilchik? Who's that?"" SC: ""36-24-36. Does that answer your question?"" CB: ""Yeah, but you still didn't tell me who is she?"" SC: ""She was Miss Armored Division of 1961 and she was still growing!"" CB: ""I get the picture."" SC: ""She's a waitress now. She dropped out of nursing school."" CB: ""How'd you get to meet her?"" SC: ""Well, when I was stationed back there a few years ago, she was going with a sergeant in chemical warfare. When I came along, I was like a breath of fresh air."" (brilliant joke btw)   (skip ahead a bit)  SC: ""Alright Pyle, let's go."" CB: ""I'll get your gear, Sarge."" Gomer Pyle: ""Do you know where I think we ought to go to first? Mount Vernon, I've seen all the pictures.""   (skip ahead a bit again)  SC: ""I've already got all my gear."" GP: ""Surprise, surprise, surprise!"" SC: ""Pyle?"" GP: ""Ain't that something Sergeant, looks like we're gonna be sharing the same room!"" SC: ""Huh?""   The clips used in the movie version are from the 1955 film The Dam Busters (the film which George Lucas borrowed/copied heavily from during the battle scenes in Star Wars, but enough digression)"

pinkfloyd,3cg9q1,tanukis_parachute,3,Wed Jul 8 03:43:16 2015 UTC,"This is probably one of my favourite tracks on The Wall. I break down the sides of The Wall as such: 1 is his childhood, 2 is fame and the building of the wall, 3 is when the cracks begin to appear, and 4 is when it breaks down.   With Nobody Home sat in the middle of side 3, I believe it really carries it through the somewhat filler-like songs (Vera and Bring The Boys Back Home) and starts to get you ready for Comfortably Numb.  Understated, and loses much of its significance out of context, but still very pleasant to listen to."

Terrible song selection (way to much DSOTM and WYWH and not enough Barrett stuff or deeper tracks than Wots...uh The deal. Seriously no Fat Old Sun? The Nile Song? Interstellar Overdrive? Astronome Domine? ect? Its like the sub was trying to make the most down the middle mainstream Best of album they could.   Then the tracklist comes out and its probably the worst combination it could possibly be. Songs 6-13 are pretty much just WYWH with one song added on. Then you have two epics one right after another in High Hopes and Echoes to end the album, which is just terrible. The songs should have a variation in length to make the album more interesting. Plus the tracks from DSOTM play in album order on the greatest hits album and there is around 6 of them. Why not just combine Dark Side and WYWH and call it a day?   Now the title of the damn thing. Its horrendous. There already is a title of a Pink Floyd greatest hits called Echoes.   I have no doubt that the art will be cool though so that's something. But really this is a study on why group think doesn't lead to good results. What we have is a poorly thought out, badly named, mainstream Pink Floyd greatest hits album. Those already exist there is no need for another one."

But now that it's in its final phase you want to trash it even though you did nothing to try to influence the direction up to this point.   I get it, the project is full of only the most popular songs and not enough fringe stuff.  It's pretty vanilla.  But showing up to the party in time for dessert and calling the the people who have been there since the door opened poor decision makers for not choosing Rainbow Sherbet over Vanilla Ice Cream isn't cool.  Especially when you didn't even bring any Rainbow Sherbet yourself.  All that being said, this is a topic that's been discussed and we're talking about doing a second part for songs outside the Dark Side to Wall era.

Not everyone on the sub is a die-hard, know every obscure fact about Floyd kind of person, and this is a good introduction to Floyd for someone just stopping by.  It is a good ""Greatest Hits"" list which I think most of us knew was going to happen.  Also, that being said, I appreciate the work people put into this to make it happen so thanks!  I know for myself I will be more involved in the ""Spare Bricks"" companion list we put together of lesser known Floyd songs.

I miss that station.    It's still on I think. It's near like 97. Edit: It's on 97.1    The River is constantly on, along with The Bert Show (I forget the channel), but I've never heard them. One time I heard the live version of ""Do You Feel Like We Do?"" (Peter Frampton, ironically the day I found and bought it Frampton Come Alive on vinyl), followed by THDOOL/ABITWP2, but I didn't check the channel :C  Edit again for no reason: Strange, nothing to do with PF, The River played ""Peace of Mind"" exactly 10 minutes after 100.5 did, and ""Rock of Ages"" 2 minutes after.

Speak to Me / Breath - Pink Fraud   And it's the actual thing, not a cover/tribute, not a remix, the original mix, but, what the hell?"

pinkfloyd,3c810v,PinkFloydJoe,5,Sun Jul 5 21:12:31 2015 UTC,"It is very hard, which is why no one has really been able to repeat Clare's performance on the album, including Clare herself ;) (she sang it with Floyd on a couple of shows in 1973, and later on a show for Roger's 1987 tour... and she doesnt quite pull it off on either occasion)  As for this performer, there is no doubt she has a very good voice and a good range, but I do not like this version. It has too much of what I like to call ""vocal masturbation"" (which, apparently now has a different meaning, I see on urban dictionary, so I guess I need to find a different name for it); the kind you see every single female perfomer trying out for American Idol do, and which Americans for some unfathomable reason seem to love and think is great... it isnt great, it's annoying. Which is a shame, cause Im sure she could have pulled off a very decent version of it if she had ditched those ridiculous endless masturbatory vocals."

I don't have a music background, so I won't know all the intricacies (and corresponding vocabulary) of what makes one style better than another. But, overall I did find Angela's version to have a more expanded range (without struggling) and better use of breathing than the original and other live performances.   Of course, Clare is the original and she created a wonderful segment."

pinkfloyd,3c4yg4,Torquemada1970,2,Sun Jul 5 08:57:34 2015 UTC,"Along with what /u/UsNotThem said about Jon Carin playing backup slide, typically roadies will have the guitar ready in their hands when the performer needs it, so David probably just got up and someone put the guitar on him right then. That's why the camera was on Roger during that part. In 2006 David just played the slide with the guitar around his back. Wow I didn't know that! Thanks."

Animals doesn't need anything else to add to the story that it's trying to tell. The Wall is over - extended as it is. The option with the most potential is Meddle.   With Meddle, you got to see the direction they were going. It's a fully transitional album, that diddles around in the AHM/Ummagumma era and then with Echoes shows you just how much potential they had in 1971.  Adding a track between let's say, A Pillow of Winds and Fearless would tip this scale from Meddle being a really good transitional album, to one of the all-time greats."

It's also their most prog IMO, three of the five tracks are all longer than ten minutes and all feature a ton of different sections and stuff. I think The Wall is pretty awesome lyrically, so I'd say that's their best album lyrics wise but I think Dogs is Pink Floyd's  single greatest song both lyrically and musically.

Can't get tired of it. The outro guitar solo of Sheep is my personal favourite guitar solo performed by Pink Floyd. Besides the fact that the solo is great, the construction of the song makes the moment even better. It feels like the whole song is just working up to that one solo. It's magical."

Basically, Pete Best, but even more unknown, I'd argue. Piper got them considerable recognition, so I'd disagree with Syd being the Pete Best of PF."
pinkfloyd,3c1u1b,Megalandrys,2,Sat Jul 4 04:55:48 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. When I think of Pink Floyd, I think of Waters, Gilmour, Mason, and Wright just as I think of Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Starr though."
pinkfloyd,3c1u1b,greeniguana6,2,Sat Jul 4 05:11:04 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but no one thinks Klose, Waters, Mason, and Wright either, eh? Or even Klose, Syd, Waters, Mason, and Wright. It really applies to both, but by contributions to the band as a whole, Syd was a lot higher than both there.  Edit: Heh, higher."

pinkfloyd,3c1u1b,greeniguana6,2,Sat Jul 4 05:39:10 2015 UTC,"Ah-ha, it's all good; most people don't really, but I fell in love with Syd at first sound, so I naturally researched him and the band a lot, and found out a lot of stuff. Needless to say, I'm a tad obsessed.   Again, most people don't realize the impact they made. Roger and, well, Roger (Syd) were good friends as children; David and Syd were good friends as teens, I believe. Nick and Rick became his friends, I'd say, so when he went practically insane, it had a big impact on them, so they did a lot of lyrical/conceptual tributes to him, and not to forget the 3 or so years they spent following the musical path he set them on, until they carved that blues/prog rock tone around Meddle/Dark Side."
pinkfloyd,3c1u1b,Megalandrys,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:51:03 2015 UTC,I'm going to spend some time listening to Saucerful of Secrets through Animals and see how many potential Syd references I can figure out.
pinkfloyd,3c1u1b,greeniguana6,3,Sat Jul 4 05:53:27 2015 UTC,"Thinking back on it, I want to listen to ""Dogs"" and ""Sheep"" again, real quick, to see if maybe he might make a slight reference to him. It's very far-fetched, especially considering I've memorized the lyrics to ""Dogs"" and can say it'd be hard to find it in there, but in concept, I can see it.  David's 'character' in ""Dogs"" seems to cut himself off from society, like Pink and Syd, is very cynical (common in schizophrenics, which Syd was (and still is) theorized to have been), and one line at the end stands out to reference him, to me: ""Who was told what to do by the man"". This fits with the original theme of the song, as well as with Roger's anti-'the man' thing, but at the same time, his lyrics in ""Jugband Blues"" indicate that he felt he was being forced into the studio to do things he no longer had the patience, sanity/mindset (?), or interest to do. A similar theme appears in ""Vegetable Man"", as well.   Interestingly enough, it just now came on, as of writing this sentence.  Anyway, with ""Sheep"", same idea, sort of. The first two verses can link to him: ""Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air"", as in not really realizing how everything will change (he was so high he probably didn't know what he was doing, and just though he was being him, which he sort of was) for him soon, but then when he realizes what happens, it's too late (again, ""Jugband Blues"", if you take the song to be about the band inevitably kicking him out).   But those are a far search, you can find musical traits throughout until OBC really, as I said, and lyrical references in all the albums I indicated. You'll find them; happy searching anyway!"

If Syd didn't exist, would we have Wish You Were Here?   Pink Floyd is what it is because things happened as they happened. It's hard to say better or worse, when things are so connected and interdependent.  I usually say that Pink Floyd with Syd was neither better nor worse, it was simply essential."

pinkfloyd,3c0pup,Plsdontreadthis,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:29:01 2015 UTC,"Well, for a short period of time Dave and Syd have been in the band simultaneously.

They even made some photo sessions during this short period."
pinkfloyd,3c0pup,mDodd,0,Mon Jul 6 16:28:53 2015 UTC,"I meant with the stipulation that Pink Floyd would have consisted of the Gilmour, Waters, Wright, Mason lineup. Which, considering question 1, wouldnt be likely, but in 2 wouldnt be impossible. The real answer to 2 is that what we know as Pink Floyd would never have gotten that name, they would have continued with Bob Klose on guitar and with a completely different sound, and possible fizzled out into nothingness. But the other ""reality"" to question 2 is if Syd didnt exist and David had joined anyway, would we still have WYWH? And I say yes we likely would. You say Syd is the inspiration behind SOYCD, but he's really only the inspiration for the lyrics. So the lyrics would be different, and the title would be different, but musically speaking, something very similar to SOYCD would have still come out of those improvisation sessions between those four members. That is my opinion anyway."
pinkfloyd,3c0pup,GroovingPict,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:56:10 2015 UTC,"Well, now I have to agree with you, that's a good point.

Different names, different lyrics and, maybe, different melodies, but following a similar style."

pinkfloyd,3c0pup,Derpy_Bird,18,Fri Jul 3 18:42:05 2015 UTC,"Objectively better. You can prefer Syd Floyd, but they weren't innovating new sounds the way they did with Gilmour. On top of that, during Syd Floyd, Syd was the creative thrust of the group. When he left, it forced all four members to try and replace him, and Roger, David, and Richard went on to develop styles that put their work at the top of the annals of Rock and Roll history. Richard, the most modest of those three, is still the key to the sound of Pink Floyd's most recognizable album.  If you still think they objectively got worse after Syd left after that, you're not looking past your own musical preferences."

Technically, you're probably right -- in that the majority of people who know and love Floyd today were first drawn to the band by Dark Side, or The Wall, or at the very least - something more like the more popular Floyd albums of the 70's.  That said, it's not as if Pink Floyd would today be virtually unknown, had Syd stayed with the group.  The impact they had in the late 60's (both with Syd, and shortly after) only gained in importance and influence over time.  I get what you're saying, but the Syd-era of Pink Floyd did have a big impact in its own right, on bands like XTC (see The Dukes of Stratosphere), and the like."

You wouldn't have anything until Meddle at all, pretty much, and ""Echoes"" and a lot of Obscured By Clouds would be... different. TDSotM would not have ""Brain Damage/Eclipse"", maybe not even ""Time"", and that's assuming they ever got to make the album. All you'd have is Animals, The Final Cut, and the Gilmour-era, again only if they even got to it.   Edit: ^ Assuming the band ever bloody formed, if he hadn't existed, or took off without him staying with it for a bit. I mean, not only did Roger say the band never would've started without him; Rick was shy, Nick had sung maybe one song ever, David was only brought in because of Syd, and without Syd may not even be who he is (same with Roger), and Roger apparently was nervous about his voice (Gilmour reportedly had to practically force him to sing on ""Brain Damage/Eclipse""), so they wouldn't really have anything there."

pinkfloyd,3c0pup,Rooster_Ties,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:56:04 2015 UTC,"The Syd-era was great in a different way, and so was Syd - though admittedly only when measured by different standards.  Syd's writing was not entirely unlike that of early Bob Dylan, in terms of going outside of standard forms, and a willingness to abandon predictable chord changes at every turn (and I say that NOT as someone who is a big Dylan fan, which I'm most decidedly not).  It took me years to appreciate Syd's music, but it is and was important, and has grown on me over time.  I was go so far as to say that Syd was nearly as important (in his time), as Kurt Cobain was in his -- neither were 'gods', but both were visionary, but also flawed."

pinkfloyd,3c0pup,BamaDillert,3,Fri Jul 3 19:05:04 2015 UTC,"It depends which kind of music you like, honestly. If you like the psychedelic sounds of yesterday's tomorrow, than Syd Barrett's Floyd was the best. If you liked the refined, sleeker sound of the Gilmour Era, then post Barrett Floyd is best. It's not an objective thing, it's entirely subjective; both eras produced great music, but depending on your ears, you might favor one over the other."

pinkfloyd,3c0pup,HereEverafter,3,Fri Jul 3 20:20:45 2015 UTC,"Well, they released Animals after Syd had left, sooooo... better.   But honeslty, who knows what they could have done if Syd had stayed. Saucerful of Secrets and More certainly weren't better than Piper, so they didn't just leap in quality when the left. They were a young band and they became more experienced and expirimented more and were able to use trial and error so yes, they got better, but I don't think it had anything to do with Syd. If  anything, losing Syd set them back for a bit, but, unlike some bands that lose their frontmen never recover (Misfits), Pink Floyd was able to get their own groove going and honeslty completely rejuvenate themselves from Syd's sound. Of course it's all a matter of opinion and some people like one sound and some people like the other. I love both, but I think that when they figured out what they were doing Post-Syd, they definitely became a better band."
pinkfloyd,3c0pup,fatfaggotsnacks1,2,Sat Jul 4 04:04:39 2015 UTC,I'd have like to see how they adapted from Piper at the gates of dawn.
pinkfloyd,3c0pup,e2hawkeye,2,Fri Jul 3 23:25:01 2015 UTC,"The band became better as a functioning creative and performing unit. But I will always think of the Barrett era songs as their most captivating. There is an absolutely unique style there that is equal parts sixties psychedelia, Edwardian whimsy, and disquieting surrealistic menace, all paired with a McCartneyesque flair for major key melodies. But Barrett burned bright and burned fast, I read somewhere that he wrote nearly all of his Floyd era songs in the six months prior to the Piper debut and was in coast mode after that."
pinkfloyd,3c0pup,nemo1080,2,Fri Jul 3 19:43:48 2015 UTC,Apples and oranges.  Actually more like red and green apples
pinkfloyd,3c0pup,Megalandrys,2,Fri Jul 3 22:05:02 2015 UTC,"Based on everything I've said and read, by popularity and everything, mainstream view, etc etc, the band got better after he left. By mass preference, same. Others would disagree, though. But saying he had little contribution, or that his part in the band was irrelevant to anything besides Piper, a ""bit"" of ASoS, and WYWH, is completely ignorant."

pinkfloyd,3c0pup,Megalandrys,0,Fri Jul 3 22:33:22 2015 UTC,Better a lot better. I'll be in a minority but 90% of the stuff with Syd was pure shit.
pinkfloyd,3c0pup,greeniguana6,2,Sat Jul 4 00:25:52 2015 UTC,"The Wall, The Dark Side of the Moon, and Atom Heart Mother had considerable inspiration from/references to Syd. The first two arguably being their best/one of the three best albums by them. Also, in Roger's own words ""The band would've never fucking started without him"".  Edit: Well, Dark Side had ""Brain Damage/Eclipse"", particularly the first half of that, combo, which was very Syd Barrett-esque. ""Time"" could, arguably, reflect his later reclusive life as well.  Edit Edit: I'll go ahead and argue AHM; I think The Wall is pretty easy to understand, in that regard.  ""If"" is about Roger's regret of basically kicking Syd from the band, so far that I know.  ""Summer '68"" has an eerie '68-'69 Barrett feel to it, and a few lines could apply to him.  ""Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast"" (and, to a much lesser extent, without counting his idea with ""Jugband Blues"" as influence, ""Atom Heart Mother"" (Suite)) has a, well, psychedelic feel, the one that Syd brought with him in Piper.  If you want to go even deeper, I'd say that pretty much all of ASoS is still working off of Barrett's stuff, and that continued until about Ummagumma/AHM, but ""Echoes"" and a couple of songs on Obscured By Clouds could have been drawn from Barrett's work at the beginning. Meddle is where Barrett's musical influence really almost completely stopped, completely stopping with the release of Dark Side, but references to him continued with every album from Dark Side to until Animals, and then The Wall. I wouldn't know about AMLoR on, though, but I doubt it. Though David and Syd were great friends, maybe even better than Syd and Roger were, he didn't really seem to like him/like to talk about him/sing about him much."
pinkfloyd,3c0pup,Megalandrys,2,Fri Jul 3 20:52:01 2015 UTC,"Hmm, never thought of Brain Damage as a reference to Syd, but I have noticed the the drug references in it even though I read somewhere that Gilmour and Waters had never gotten heavily into drugs. Makes sense."
pinkfloyd,3c0pup,greeniguana6,2,Sat Jul 4 06:40:15 2015 UTC,"I didn't at first, either. Looking back on it though, it's pretty obvious, to be honest. The insanity, the ""if the band you're in starts playing different tunes, I'll see you on the dark side of the moon"", etc etc."
pinkfloyd,3c0pup,Megalandrys,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:24:19 2015 UTC,"It's making sense to me now, but what does:   I'll see you on the dark side of the moon   mean in relation to Syd? surely there are multiple interpretations of this."
pinkfloyd,3c0pup,greeniguana6,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:54:17 2015 UTC,"Insanity in general. So, not necessarily Syd, but given the lyrics before it, I'd say it's just talking about Barrett going insane. It could also just mean insanity in general, but ""if the band you're in starts playing different tunes"" always makes my Barrett-senses tingle, so that line straight after links to it well enough."

pinkfloyd,3c419a,Lime528,8,Sat Jul 4 18:48:11 2015 UTC,As somebody that listens to unhealthy amount of hip-hop and Pink Floyd I can understand where you are coming from.  Some points could be put over a hip-hop instrumental and might work.  However that can be said for a lot of songs.  Most music snobs will disagree but rapping is just a form of singing.  When singing goes a little faster and has some internal rhymes it can sound similar to rap.  All this being said though the lyrics to this song don't really come close at all to being called rap just a rock song that has internal rhymes and is a little faster than other pink floyd songs.
pinkfloyd,3c419a,freemypeter,3,Sat Jul 4 20:18:51 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm a music snob but rapping is closer to rhythmic poetry then singing, not to say that the majority of rap songs don't have some singing in them."

They'll eventually learn to appreciate it for a completely different reason besides ""it's catchy"" or ""i like to sing along to it"" like most kids do, but they'll remember how they used to listen to the music. Not only that, but so many songs they may have hated when they were 10 years old, they may love when they are 20."
pinkfloyd,3bw3so,EpicShitStorm,-18,Sat Jul 4 00:46:57 2015 UTC,"I sincerely doubt a kid would like Pink Floyd, how about you let him listen to his own shit instead"

pinkfloyd,3bw3so,togepitothemax,6,Thu Jul 2 19:49:32 2015 UTC,I liked (some) Pink Floyd as a kid. Letting his kid wear his shirt is a lot different from forcibly tying him down and strapping headphones on him.
pinkfloyd,3bw3so,TheTrollys,5,Thu Jul 2 19:39:48 2015 UTC,My sons favorite band is Pink Floyd. By HIS own choice. Kids are a product of their environment.
pinkfloyd,3bw3so,JayStar1213,3,Thu Jul 2 20:37:40 2015 UTC,"Yes and no, my dad is a huge Zeppelin fan, which got me listening to Rock in general. By my own ventures, I listened to a lot of DnB and Chillstep. Of course, Floyd tunes started sticking out to me as they were the perfect mix of the two.  Haven't looked back since, although I've pretty much fallen off the electronic music bandwagon and stick primarily with all types of rock. The other main reason is because I play guitar, so you know, guitar heavy/driven music is always nice to hear.  Still haven't found a sound that parallels some of Floyd's greatest."

Half of that website has 404'd and the other half doesn't contain any useful information.  We already knew that it existed at some point. We already knew that it was produced at some point in history. What we don't know - and haven't come any closer to proving, in the last six months - is whether or not it exists at this point in time. We don't know if it's on the internet somewhere.  If any version of it exists anymore, it's probably sitting in a box of used records in some record store in Nowhere, Wyoming.

It was supposed to sound like, and make fun of, contemporary 'hard rock' that focused on loud sounds and lyrics devoted to sex and drugs.   In a way, the lyrics are extremely symbolic - not only is it Pink, the character, introducing himself to the world of rock and roll; it's also Pink Floyd, the band, sarcastically asking the music industry if it would accepted in a genre it had mostly avoided (""Stranger in this town...""; this also introduces a third, ironic, layer, because PF was one of the most successful bands of its time at this point).  It's ridiculously ironic and kinda hilarious that they were - Young Lust was a radio hit, and its mimicry of hard rock was so spot-on that many people don't even know that it's satire."

This essentially got me into looking for some progressive rock similar to some of the works in Queen II, and I found the Floyd and have been hooked ever since. I don't think I've really had a favorite band other than those two in my recent memory. Maybe Area 11 for a bit of the transitional period, I dunno."

Well, they still are admittedly, but Floyd comes at a very close second tied with Rush.  You know, Queen and Pink Floyd actually have a shocking amount in common nowadays. The bassist left, the keyboardist died, and now it's just the guitarist and drummer. Yes, it's a very shallow comparison, but it's really just an amusing thing to think about and nothing more."

I didn't know this version very well yet, so I didn't know what to say, and most unfortunately let the co-pilot change the station.

pinkfloyd,3bso0q,PinkFloydJoe,3,Thu Jul 2 20:53:34 2015 UTC,"I consider each Side of the album it's own track, so it's basically a four-track Pink Floyd album of long songs, instead of 18-or-so really short tracks."
pinkfloyd,3bso0q,androsphere,3,Wed Jul 1 22:38:32 2015 UTC,"It felt like none of the music ideas had been explored as much as previous Floyd material.  For example, The Lost Art of Conversation had such a beautifully sad mood with a free flowing feel, but it lasted less than two minutes. Then On Noodle Street drives it a bit and loses the piano part, but that also lasts under two minutes.  My main beef with TER is that even when you add together the musical ideas that got ""chopped"" into multiple songs, they are short. TER follows the Floyd formula, but forces it to take place in limited time, rather than letting it unfold."
pinkfloyd,3bso0q,Rooster_Ties,2,Thu Jul 2 08:15:08 2015 UTC,"I love TER, but I too wish the overall album had been longer - be that with longer individual segments, or more of them (i.e. more ""sides"")."

Then, with the (then) upcoming release of The Endless River, I started listening to The Division Bell a lot more last fall.

I grew up listening to it a lot :)  Plus it really is a fantastic album.

One of the more powerful tracks of the album, in terms of the vocal delivery.   Facts: (From Wikipedia) The song, originally titled In Shades of Grey, addresses the great hopes following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the disappointment that followed.  Despite Gilmour's statements to the contrary, the lyrics have often been read as a reflection on the bitter and estranged partnership Gilmour had with former bandmate Roger Waters. By this interpretation, the ""Great Day for Freedom"" would be the day Waters left the band, giving the other members freedom to determine the band's future direction."

Their music had an immeasurable impact on my life and my internal evolution.   Then you would most likely enjoy the album for what it's worth. It's a bitter sweet wrap-up to Floyd's entire journey, with lots of different sounds ranging from the psychedelic days to Gilmour's standalone sounds. It's no studio album for sure - there's no story or overarching message, but more of a collection of things that could have been and that once were upon a time. And, of course, it's a big nod to Wright.   the fact that this album is new and released without Roger Waters' participation scares me   Floyd has always been a sum of its parts, and has had many different sounds in the past with either Syd, Waters, or Gilmour at the helm. It's an idea rather than a specific sound or lyric."
pinkfloyd,3buhf3,Flamov,6,Thu Jul 2 07:25:39 2015 UTC,Just remember a lot of the album was recorded at the same time as the Division Bell. If you like Db you'll probably enjoy the Endless River.
pinkfloyd,3buhf3,Onedwa,4,Thu Jul 2 10:35:15 2015 UTC,"So the fact that this album is new and released without Roger Waters' participation scares me.   I guess you still haven't listened to A Momentary Lapse of Reason and The Division Bell yet either, eh? right?"
pinkfloyd,3buhf3,HarryBlotter,-5,Thu Jul 2 08:03:45 2015 UTC,No I have listened to them and like them. But things change in 20 years; 1994 to 2014 is a long time.
pinkfloyd,3buhf3,maakuz,9,Thu Jul 2 09:24:33 2015 UTC,Most of the recordings are still from the 93 sessions. There are parts that sound like they are from a 70s Floyd record.  Floyd is a huge part of your life and who you are. Then you should not let one album change that. Listen to it for what it is.
pinkfloyd,3buhf3,GamerTyke,2,Thu Jul 2 10:12:03 2015 UTC,You're right. Putting it next to the Division Bell makes me think it's worth hearing. Thanks!
pinkfloyd,3buhf3,Torquemada1970,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:50:45 2015 UTC,It's just Division Bell II (with no lyrics).   EDIT: And that's not a bad thing. I love both TDB and TER.
pinkfloyd,3buhf3,maakuz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:18:19 2015 UTC,I thought stuff like Autumn '68 was from the 70's Floyd era...

pinkfloyd,3buhf3,Rooster_Ties,2,Thu Jul 2 07:19:35 2015 UTC,"The main thing is to keep listening to it, and don't just give up on it after 2 or 3 spins.  Initially I was really excited about the album, but after the first week I would have probably only rated it a 6/10.  But then a couple months later, my experience of it had definitely deepened, and now I think it's a solid 8/10 (and I love it).  There's SO much going on, layer after layer.  There area clearly places where Dave's added overdubs on top of overdubs -- and yet, none of it is ever too 'busy' or fussy.  Given the genesis of the album, and the source material, I think TER is nothing short of being 'almost brilliant'.  Best Floyd album (IMHO), since Animals."
pinkfloyd,3buhf3,Rooster_Ties,2,Thu Jul 2 15:36:11 2015 UTC,I don't think that anyone in thier right mind can say that TER (even though I like it a lot) is better then The Wall.  I mean come on.

pinkfloyd,3bq337,GamerTyke,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:01:28 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I could be wrong, but I think it'd make a lot of sense to put Rick's albums somewhere attached to the post-waters albums. I'm not sure about Nick's albums, as I'm not as familiar with them"
pinkfloyd,3bq337,GamerTyke,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:00:02 2015 UTC,"Based on my first encounter with his Fictitious Sports album, I'd guess Nick's work belongs with their early experimental stuff, like Ummagumma, Piper, and Atom Heart Mother."

pinkfloyd,3bpiha,Esperanzan,8,Wed Jul 1 02:49:17 2015 UTC,"Roger Waters himself acknowledged Syd as a genius, and his opinion is probably worth more than anyone else's.  The problem with Syd is threefold:  1)  He burned out/retired before being able to develop further as a songwriter; 2)  Nobody around him understood his vision or goals; 3)  Modern listeners are likely to dismiss his body of work as just a bunch of goofy pop songs, which in a sense they were, but...  Syd has a lot of depth.  This is one of those things where you have to feel it and it can't be explained.    I don't want to assume I know what his intentions were, but when I listen to Madcap Laughs or Barrett, I hear someone trying to break down and make something unpredictable out of the pop formula.  In the end those albums may have ended up half-baked, or not as Syd had originally envisioned them, but some of those songs are so haunting that they've moved me to tears.  And it's like nothing you can get with any other artist.  And for the record, Piper should probably be WAY higher on those ""best album"" lists that corporate magazines put out but the fact that Syd's music maintains its selective appeal is kind of cool, actually."
pinkfloyd,3bpiha,smokedjowls,2,Wed Jul 1 04:57:59 2015 UTC,"Syd is the reason  / influence there is T-Rex Who wrote yes some of the poppiest' catchiest songs, but was the fore runner of Punk and Alt Bands.. The Dammed, etc"
pinkfloyd,3bpiha,bolanrox,2,Wed Jul 1 12:51:53 2015 UTC,"How can you convince me that ""bike"" or some of the other goofy pop songs are product of his being depth?  This is not a snarky remark. I don't see Barrett as a genius and maybe I am missing out."
pinkfloyd,3bpiha,smilingarmpits,3,Wed Jul 1 08:58:56 2015 UTC,"Listen to the record ""Opel"".  Basically B-sides, outtakes but mostly no fancy mixing or engineering - just Syd and his guitar stripped down.  That album in my opinion puts him at genius level (besides founding Pink Floyd and PATGOD of course).  The song ""Opel"" itself is haunting.  But as far as Floyd goes he set the stage and a feel that pervades throughout all Floyd records, even without him, kinda like an ability to experiment and be different as a band.    It's kinda hard to put into words really, I think maybe you either feel it or you don't."
pinkfloyd,3bpiha,hannibellecter,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:39:22 2015 UTC,Will try - thanks!
pinkfloyd,3bpiha,smilingarmpits,2,Thu Jul 2 08:20:36 2015 UTC,"Well, Syd obviously wasn't interested in writing conventional songs on Piper, and everything has that Alice in Wonderland vibe.  The depth in Piper is mostly in the creativity of the arrangements and the fantastical imagery.  ""Jugband Blues"" and some of his solo work is openly existential, though.  I'm thinking of songs like ""Dark Globe"", ""Late Night"", ""Waving My Arms in the Air""."

I feel like the whole sound of that album was a bit different from anything else they did too, but Floyd's more popular work later on kind of causes people to overlook Piper today. I quite like some of his solo work too, I don't know if you've checked that out.  Not as well known as his work with Floyd is, but it always seemed to me like he had a unique way of putting chords together.  Octopus and Terrapin are both very nice, in my opinion anyway."

pinkfloyd,3bnolo,PinkFloydBot,3,Tue Jun 30 18:00:29 2015 UTC,"Vera Lynn, British singer particularly known for singing to and entertaining the troops during WW2. Still alive today, at 98 years. The line ""remember how she said that we would meet again some sunny day"" refers to one of her bigger WW2 era hits We'll Meet Again. The song can also be heard in the opening of the album Is There Anybody Out There: The Wall Live 1980-81.  Sidenote: The opening scene from The Wall movie features another Vera Lynn song: The Little Boy That Santa Claus Forgot, which isnt a coincidence, considering the following lyrics from it and how it relates to both the character Pink in the movie and the personal life of Roger Waters: ""In the street he envied all those lucky boys, then wandered home to last year's broken toys. Im so sorry for that laddie, he hasnt got a daddy, that little boy that Santa Claus forgot"".  David plays both bass guitar and acoustic guitar on this.  Orchestral parts by New York Symphony Orchestra.  The dialogue at the beginning of the track is from the 1969 movie The Battle of Britain (relevant scene): ""Where the hell are you? Where the hell are you, Simon!"" over which a BBC Radio announcer can be heard saying: ""There were 47 German planes were [sic] destroyed with the loss of only 15 of our own aircraft"". It serves, I suppose, to juxtapose the trivialisation of the loss of ""only"" 15 human lives by the radio announcer while the desperate cries of a pilot fighting for his life in the battle (albeit a movie version of it) can be heard."

pinkfloyd,3bnolo,InMyBrokenChair,-4,Tue Jun 30 21:53:27 2015 UTC,Eh. It's an okay song for Pink Floyd standard. It's defiantly filler for The Wall when it gets boiled down.
pinkfloyd,3bnolo,KIMrPickle,8,Tue Jun 30 19:32:19 2015 UTC,"I really don't think it is filler at all, you can hear the pain in Roger's voice, it is a genuine song. At this point in the album ""Pink"" is in la la land, reminiscing, at the same time feeling resentful about a song by Vera Lynn he used to listen to as a child, hoping him and his father would meet again, very fitting."

pinkfloyd,3blgil,lemiskewl,2,Tue Jun 30 07:20:37 2015 UTC,"I have been watching it since its release.   But it was adapted from a great book, titled the same. Check out the book if you liked the movie, i loved the book.  I also rememeber it being bashed by the critics due to the rapant drug use in movie (ya know, the center plot) and the fact that the movie wasn't sort of centered around sympathy for the devil, as the book relied heavily on it. All i know is it has a great soundtrack and plot, and they were right when detailing the trips. (I too saw crazy bat like creatures when on mescoline).   http://www.amazon.com/Fear-Loathing-Las-Vegas-American/dp/0679785892  Really underated movie that should be a 9.6 not 3.7. At least imbd gave it a 7.7.  Really glad to hear someone else likes this movie, i felt like i was the only one.   Bonus fact - That weird mojo youtube thing mixes up the somebody to love, and whiterabbit scenes, making itheir show seem really dumb"
pinkfloyd,3blgil,bolanrox,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:42:02 2015 UTC,"YouTube thing? I've been watching it on Netflix this whole time haha.   I guess I should have assumed it was an actual book. I would love to read it, thanks for bringing that to my  attention.   As for the lack of a sympathy for the devil, I assumed the movie was just portraying actions and behaviors that existed, rather than trying to justify them one way or another. Did that emotion towards the characters ib the book work in favor of it?"

But, no, I didn't think that the first time I heard it - nor even the 12th time.  After the first couple weeks (and maybe a dozen spins), I would have given it a 6/10 -- but a month later, and a couple dozen more spins later, it's a very solid 8/10 in my book.  Yes, I wish several of the tracks were longer, and went further -- and overall, I wish the album were twice as long.  That said, there is SO much going on under the surface, that really only becomes apparent the more you listen to it.  My biggest suggestion is to listen closely, especially for Dave's guitar-work, which clearly has overdubs on top of overdubs - but so tastefully.  My favorite Pink Floyd album since Animals - seriously.  Makes me wish the band had done more (similar) projects, like Household Objects, and the like.  The Endless River clearly won't be everyone's cup of tea, but I think it's pretty fantastic."

pinkfloyd,3bd9ex,Tactical_Lemon,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:15:57 2015 UTC,i can agree with the idea that it takes you back to the late 60's/pre-meddle sound just a bit. I didn't really like or understand the album until i read that it was basically gilmour/mason's elegy for wright. they made the album basically as a memory to him and all that he contributed over the years.   its a lot easier to listen to with that in mind.

pinkfloyd,3bd9ex,swordstool,0,Mon Jun 29 15:39:30 2015 UTC,"Quite like it, any extra Gilmour-Floyd is always going to get a shot - but it's very in the mould of Zep's CO/DA; a bunch of ideas, some of which could have been developed, some of which (for example) sounded too much like previous songs (Run Like Hell, anyone?), some of which were solo-Gilmour incidental music from Arthur C. Clark TV programmes about fractals (which smacks of not-enough-material).  Glad they released it, but it really should have been an extra on the 20th anniversary re-release of TDB instead of trading on nostalgia and pretending it was a 'new' album. I mean, if there was that much good stuff in there, why did they wait twenty years (including several solo albums) until after Rick had died to do it?"

pinkfloyd,3b6t6k,vilest,2,Fri Jun 26 19:19:58 2015 UTC,I think the Roger-era would've happened either way. As Pink Floyd or with another band. And at time I'd bet the other original members would've rather joined him that stick with Barrett.

pinkfloyd,3b92wn,Esperanzan,10,Fri Jun 26 23:39:43 2015 UTC,"As a whole the performance was fantastic, a great final curtain call for the band. It really shows during the finale of Comfortably Numb, everybody is relishing in the performance. It's also the last time Roger played with Rick live IIRC.  The set was alright, could've used more singing from Roger (Wish You Were Here should've been sang solely by David). How are you going to be satisfied with a 4-song, 20 minute Pink Floyd show anyway? It's a shame they couldn't be bothered to give us a full hour together, imagine all the other great material we could've heard."

pinkfloyd,3b77d5,GamerTyke,9,Fri Jun 26 15:03:20 2015 UTC,"I used to listen to their music every day, thinking ""I won't ever get tired of this"" but I did. There's only so much material you can listen to before it gets repetitive. There was a period of time where I sought out bootlegged concerts to break the monotony, but even those got stale after a while. That's when I started listening to the more obscure peices of music, like the Music from the Body album, the 'Folded Flags' soundtrack, all the solo albums, and that one time Roger did the soundtrack for a documentary about Rene Magritte (which wasn't an official soundtrack so you still here bits of narration over the songs). I wouldn't recommend it.   Right now I'm sort of avoiding Pink Floyd passively - I'll only listen to a song if it happens to come up on my iPod or something, but I don't deliberately seek out any Floyd tunes. My hope is that after a while I'll be able to ease back into it without getting tired of it."

The Wall in particular is tough to listen to all the way through after hearing it so many times. Dark Side and WYWH definitely have the most legs imo.   The moment it all changed was when I really got into Tame Impala, who I've seen mentioned around here a few times. They are definitely worth a listen, but might not be every Floyd fan's taste."

pinkfloyd,3b77d5,Rooster_Ties,2,Fri Jun 26 16:09:45 2015 UTC,"It varies a great deal.  Sometimes I'll go months without hearing any Floyd.  But then (since Endless River was first announced), I've been on a big Floyd and solo-Gilmour binge.  I'm in my mid-40's, so Floyd has come and gone in my list of main interests 4 or 5 times over the last 25 years."
pinkfloyd,3b77d5,OhTheHueManatee,2,Fri Jun 26 18:26:03 2015 UTC,"Every day I listen to some Floyd (unless it's one of those rare days that I don't listen to any music) and it makes up about 40% of the music I listen to throughout any day (my playlist pretty much consist of Floyd, Beatles, Ozric Tentacles, Buckethead, Korn and Weird Al). Since it's release I've listen to Endless River at least 3-8 times a month. Animals has been something I  listen to 5-10 times a month for the last 20+ years and it still sounds new while bringing up countless memories. I also listen to WYOH, Meddle, Pipers, Ummagumma, MLOR, Division Bell and More in their entirety at least 2-3 times about every 6 months. I limit how often I listen to Dark Side to about 5-8 times a year (For some reason I can get burnt out on it).  The Wall I listen to 2-5 times a year. All the other ones (Saucerful, AHM, Final Cut. ZP) I only like some of the songs on them so I almost never listen to them as a whole (If it's a been a bit I give them another chance). I almost never listen to the live stuff (with the exception of Pompeii and Ummagumma). Most of their live recording sound hollow and I feel like I'm missing major parts of the songs."

I have such an enormous variety of music that I listen to (Google Play Music for the win!) that I really only throw on a Floyd disc once or twice a week.

pinkfloyd,3b6fcq,geokeoGR,2,Fri Jun 26 21:15:04 2015 UTC,Some of their later stuff proves quite progressive. To Be Kind and parts of The Seer definitely have prog influences. It's not necessarily prog by definition but it would prove enjoyable to any fans of it.

Eh, then again, my only real point of reference is my obsession with the Floyd, and I believe someone said that, in their opinion, they aren't really that progressive rock-ish... So..."
pinkfloyd,3b6fcq,Megalandrys,2,Fri Jun 26 18:21:41 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think the progressive rock genre is more so determined by the set of instruments to produce a certain sound. Synth, guitar, bass, drums and orchestra on occasion. If you listen to a lot of the different prog rock bands, they may not all be the same, but I always found that it has to do with sweet melodies leading into more loud angry guitar and drums. I think a good example of that is Crime of The Century by Super Tramp. Also, keep in mind, by late 70's/early 80's many of the prog. Rock bands became pop-rock. Floyd did not. I always felt similarities between Crime of The Century and The Wall/Animals. Definitely a bit of a similar feel IMO."

pinkfloyd,3b6fcq,KIMrPickle,2,Sat Jun 27 10:01:50 2015 UTC,I don't consider Floyd to be prog-rock or at least that is one of the last descriptors  would use for them.  They owe more to the blues then prog-rock.  That being said Genesis with Gabriel is probably my second favorite music (tied with Grateful Dead/Albert King).
pinkfloyd,3b6fcq,hannibellecter,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:32:23 2015 UTC,"Not really, I just don't categorize them as anything really. They are a rocking symphonic band. That's all I can say, no one else I have heard is in their category for me."
pinkfloyd,3b6fcq,gm4,3,Fri Jun 26 20:47:29 2015 UTC,"I agree. I don't consider The Floyd a progressive band. The Floyd are essentially a blues based, I guess I'll borrow your phrase, ""rocking symphonic (for me, in terms of spatial scope in the music rather than symphonic sophistication)"" band. To me true prog bands musically try to use oblique jazz or classical phrasing in attempt to achieve some level of musical sophistication. Our boys produce and play simple music simply, but in a genuinely unique and unreproducible manner. The parts can't be reproduced, so the sum of their parts cannot be reproduced either. I can listen to King Crimson or Yes or many of the other prog rock bands and appreciate their artistry, but I find most of it rather tedious. There's an awful lot of wankery to be found in the world of prog."
pinkfloyd,3b6fcq,grelch,2,Fri Jun 26 16:26:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah you are right, symphonic should be used in the sense that we have pretty definite ""movements"", even within songs. Of course The Wall can be categorized as more operatic, but being a former orchestra/symphony musician Echoes struck me as the first time I had heard the rock n roll setup enter the symphonic domain.  I also completely agree with your assessment of Prog rock, not only is it jazz noise for a big part of it, but also it seems people have to be singing about ""mountain kings"" and ""fairy lands"" or other fantasy novel shelf stuff. So when people call Floyd prog rock, I listen to songs like Dogs and Sheep and wonder what the hell they are talking about."

On top of that, you made me realize that the album version of Pulse is different than the DVD version. The Album version has an ""off"" quiver. The ""quivers"" (at 3:23 on your version) are mostly identical, but on the album version, the third one after the background starts getting louder again is different. Hard to explain, but it's something like this:  Regular ones: ~~- ~~- ~~- ""Off"" one: ~..-  You can hear it on this upload: quivers. It starts at the quivers (7m48) and the ""off"" one is at 8m07.

pinkfloyd,3b3jx1,mrw412,7,Thu Jun 25 18:26:30 2015 UTC,"I was listening to the Wall in the car today, nothing like a bit of Pink Floyd to make a 2 and a half hour drive a little bit easier. The structure of the first and second halves of the albums are similar but not quite the same, and there are two major crescendos in the album that are involved.  The first one is the buildup of tension in ""Don't Leave Me Now"", which is in my opinion the darkest song on the Wall. The heavy breathing, the echoing, unusual chords, and the morose lyrics that build up to the explosion in ""Another Brick in the Wall Part III"" and then release in ""Goodbye Cruel World"" are mimicked at the end of the album too, albeit in a slightly different way.  ""Waiting for the Worms"", which still manages to give me chills after years, mirrors that crescendo, culminating in the explosive end and drop in tension into ""Stop"", which is where it differs from the previous structure, and the second buildup in ""The Trial"", which isn't as scary as the one in ""Waiting for the Worms"" drops us off back into ""Outside the Wall"", which is the analogue to ""Goodbye Cruel World"" in this case.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that I find it interesting to compare the two in terms of themes and tone, and while we find a sense of peaceful acceptance in both of them, one is a little bit more sinister in its delivery. While the ending of ""The Trial"" doesn't indicate a happy ending for our protagonist Pink, ""Outside the Wall"" parallels ""Goodbye Cruel World"" in its imagery of the Wall, where in one song Pink finds his peace completely enclosed in his cocoon, in the other he finds a different peace outside of his cocoon.  The construction of the changes in tension is pretty masterful, especially the climactic struggles that close out each half of the story, one of Pink's inability to deal with the outside world and the other of Pink's inability to deal with the world he constructed inside to keep the other one out. ""Goodbye Cruel World"" as a song is fundamental to that duality."

I used to use a Boss FA-1 clone to slam my amp at gigs and loved how that sounded.  Damn i think its going back on the list :)  I still kick myself for no buying a used blue tube back in the day when the guitar shop i was taking lessons at had one laying around for months..:)"
pinkfloyd,3b2j9w,jcdenton825,2,Thu Jun 25 13:50:25 2015 UTC,"I say, wait for for Bjorn's review of the Buffalo FX TD-X. It's Steve's take on a BK Tube Driver without the tube, so it would work better at low volumes and smaller amps. Plus most of his stuff is pretty reasonably priced. If you want more Colorsound territory, check out a Macari's Colorsound Powerboost (the 9v version is crunchier and has less headroom), or even a Boss BD-2 for that have a cigar tone and the like. I find however, the Buffalo FX PB and Macari's PB can attain that clear, crisp vintage crunch that can be heard on most Floyd albums and of course Jeff Beck's Blow by Blow."

For Overdrive I have a modded Boss DS-1 (two clipped Diodes, D4 & D5, which gives it less fizz and more of a dirty booster TS sound).  9/10 times I'm playing into my DAW using Guitar Rig 5/Amplitube 3/TH2 with various plugins.

I've only owned it for 2 weeks (it's the last album I needed to get to complete my discography) so it may grow on me still."
pinkfloyd,3b2l5x,Esperanzan,2,Fri Jun 26 05:17:46 2015 UTC,"Oh it will definitely grow on you, that being said, ""Take It Back"" is probably the worst first song you could hear from that album lol. Has to be heard from beginning to end, as the case with almost all of them. Cluster One is a tune I absolutely appreciate, hearing Rick Wright with the keyboards getting ready for a buildup, the keyboard get louder, then David's guitar comes in, ah, wets me up. That song goes into ""What Do You Want From Me?"", an excellent song which has a similar tune to ""Raise My Rent"" from David's first solo album. I love them all, Take It Back definitely had to grow on me, still my least favorite though, as is the case with most Floyd fans. Also look up the meaning for the songs, even the meanings behind the titles, I have found that it helps (for me anyway) in appreciating the album. Anyway, 2 weeks isn't enough time, definitely let it soak in! Or try to anyway, once you do, it is a very enjoyable experience that you wont regret!"

pinkfloyd,3azrm1,Dimsdale53,13,Thu Jun 25 14:25:03 2015 UTC,"I would say ""On the run"" on DSOTM."
pinkfloyd,3azrm1,GristleCZ,16,Wed Jun 24 20:49:42 2015 UTC,I think it's right song in right place. I couldn't handle Time directly following Breathe. Too many emotions.
pinkfloyd,3azrm1,tortila,3,Wed Jun 24 21:19:18 2015 UTC,I agree. Even tho I dont like it.
pinkfloyd,3azrm1,GristleCZ,2,Wed Jun 24 21:55:27 2015 UTC,I appreciated On The Run more after I started playing with synthesizers about 5 years ago...and these mother fuckers were pulling this shit in the early 70's.
pinkfloyd,3azrm1,jimothee,7,Thu Jun 25 04:25:53 2015 UTC,"On the Run.  Especially after having heard the Travel Sequence. I wish the band hadn't given up on it. Add the footsteps, voices and a plane crashing and it would've given the same feeling. It was a decent jam in the vein of Any Colour You Like and it was an actual piece of music unlike On the Run"
pinkfloyd,3azrm1,Chrisiztopher,2,Wed Jun 24 21:40:16 2015 UTC,"My feelings as well, though I wish they had found a way to integrate The Travel Sequence into DSOTM along with On The Run.  Not back-to-back, mind you.  And I still greatly prefer The Travel Sequence, but both would have been pretty cool too."
pinkfloyd,3azrm1,Rooster_Ties,3,Fri Jun 26 18:21:56 2015 UTC,"My favorite album is Wish You Were Here, which makes it way harder than Dark Side, so I go with Have a Cigar."
pinkfloyd,3azrm1,PinkFloydJoe,2,Wed Jun 24 21:02:08 2015 UTC,What' sarong with Have A Cigar!? Is it over played for you?
pinkfloyd,3azrm1,ImJustWannaLurk,6,Thu Jun 25 01:51:35 2015 UTC,"Nothing's wrong with it, but I feel all of the other songs on the record are stronger. Plus with Roy Harper singing it sounds the least like Pink Floyd out of the rest.   If any song was over played on that album it would be Wish You Were Here."
pinkfloyd,3azrm1,PinkFloydJoe,3,Thu Jun 25 02:06:52 2015 UTC,"I think ""Have A Cigar"" is a much weaker song than the rest of Wish You Were Here (it's still really good though). It's not as pensive, beautiful, cosmic or relatable as the rest of them. The song Wish You Were Here is a plea to the world to open their minds (like ""Imagine"" but better and not as full of itself), Welcome To The Machines is a dire warning about how making a living can destroy your life, then Have A Cigar is a bitch and moan session about how it's so awful being in an amazing band."
pinkfloyd,3azrm1,OhTheHueManatee,0,Thu Jun 25 09:40:19 2015 UTC,"Yup, like OP said, he has to pick one and it's basically just between Have A Cigar and WTTM (both great songs). I personally think it's hard to argue that Have a Cigar is better than WTTM."

pinkfloyd,3azrm1,cold_a,3,Thu Jun 25 03:46:55 2015 UTC,I'm with you brother.  Great Gig is a classic Floyd song.
pinkfloyd,3azrm1,hannibellecter,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:28:36 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, Great Gig is a fantastic piece of music. But in the context of the album, there's two halves to Dark Side, the first being the floaty/spacey Breathe/On The Run/Time.   The second being the more down to earth tones of the back half (using that term loosely, looking at you Brain Damage).  Gig is a great transition song between the two tones but doesn't really fit the tones themselves.  It might also cause you pain if I mention that my favourite song is Any Colour You Like..."

pinkfloyd,3azrm1,KIMrPickle,2,Thu Jun 25 01:49:23 2015 UTC,Favorite album is The Wall... I love every song but least favorite would have to be Stop
pinkfloyd,3azrm1,vpatrick,9,Wed Jun 24 20:55:47 2015 UTC,I would say Stop is important to the album. It shows Pink is done. He wants out of The Wall and is getting ready to break it down. Bring The Boys Back Home is the worst song in the album.
pinkfloyd,3azrm1,KIMrPickle,2,Thu Jun 25 00:57:19 2015 UTC,"I used to like Take It Back more than I do now. I think the other ten songs just grew on me while Take It Back stayed the same. It's nice, though."

pinkfloyd,3azrm1,tortila,14,Wed Jun 24 21:21:37 2015 UTC,"Sheep is amazing!  When the vocals fade into the synthesizer at the end of each line, it's absolutely stunning.  I don't think I've heard anything like that before."
pinkfloyd,3azrm1,TobyCelery,2,Thu Jun 25 00:05:08 2015 UTC,"Well, on The Gunner's Dream something similar happens with a sax. But yeah, the song is really unique, the problem is it is next to some of the greatest PF songs ever, so it looks kind of crappy."
pinkfloyd,3azrm1,NachoFresard,3,Thu Jun 25 00:09:13 2015 UTC,Yeah but then it would bê too short
pinkfloyd,3azrm1,PabloAimar10,3,Wed Jun 24 23:11:45 2015 UTC,I strongly disagree. You can't cut any song out of Animals without severely worsening it.

pinkfloyd,3b0g0v,buildabeast,0,Thu Jun 25 15:43:28 2015 UTC,I've played guitar for 10 years. Just because someone doesn't like music you do doesn't mean they don't understand it. Furthermore the guitar work in this song isn't that impressive.   Also Pink Floyd is my favorite band. The Endless River was just a shitty cash grab.   E: this is also a prime example of arrogant Floyd fans thinking that if you don't like anything they did it's because you don't understand it or music in general. Not everything they did was a masterpiece. Even though a lot of what they did is amazing. The Endless River isn't a great album if you look at it objectively. Most of the people in this sub wouldn't have listened to it or liked it if it didn't have the Pink Floyd name attached.
pinkfloyd,3b0g0v,buildabeast,0,Thu Jun 25 16:38:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah seriously, The Endless River is just half-baked clips from Division Bell sessions. It's not a fucking masterpiece, it's stuff Gilmour did not bother finishing besides Louder Than Words."

The scope of the catalog is pretty mind boggling for Floyd, and there is always something impressive with each album.  Most of us had some singles from The Wall and The Dark Side of the Moon to get introduced to Floyd. Time is pretty gut wrenching, and probably my favorite from Dark Side.  The opening line ""Digging away, the moments that make up the dull day"" is a punch to the throat. Animals was the soundtrack to several of my summers, along with Meddle.  I even had the chance to see Floyd play in Detroit (without Waters) and the best part is? I had never heard Astronomy Domine before.  That was the song they opened with, complete with a liquid light show.  Wow, I just got the shivers from thinking about that. Thanks for the post."
pinkfloyd,3axh95,sega_SHARK,3,Wed Jun 24 13:03:41 2015 UTC,"That's what I love about Floyd so much is that there's so many different sounds throughout their career and no matter what you like, there's usually always gonna be a floyd album that fits you.  I remember the first time I really sat down and listened to time, when "" and you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking, racing around to come up behind you again.  The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older"" came on, it's like everything just felt so meaningless and sad, it was like a punch straight to the gut, but from then on I knew PF would be my favorite.

My dad could play nearly every damn song on the piano, so he'd switch over to that when the record player was off. Then cassette tapes in the car for road trips. Hell, he even sang my sister and I ""wish you were here"" when we were kids to get us to go to sleep. In college, I took him to see a really great cover band with a light show and all and it was one of my favorite father/daughter dates.   Fast forward, I'm 27 and still listen obsessively to this band. Dad's given me all his records to enjoy on my player (along with his other badass music). My dad and I have always connected over music and this band will forever remain a strong bond in our relationship. When we're together, you'd better believe there will be some of ""that damn noise"" as momma says in the background <3"

It's always really cool to get into something that your parent/s really like or grew up with.  When I was listening to a lot of Van Halen, my parents would tell me all about how crazy they were on stage and seeing them in their prime, then it'd always end up with my dad and I arguing with my mom over how much better DLR was than Hagar."
pinkfloyd,3axh95,gibiegibiegibie,2,Wed Jun 24 20:50:11 2015 UTC,"Artists like the Beatles, Hendrix, and Zeppelin are not by any stretch of the imagination overrated.

That probably sounds conceited or something, but I really do believe that."
pinkfloyd,3axh95,chocolatechipsmusic,2,Wed Jun 24 19:09:29 2015 UTC,"A big part that I think has to do with that is that most people that get into classic rock nowadays have some interest in playing music along with listening to it. If you're playing guitar/bass/drums or wanna sing you'd start with the legendary bands/artists and try to emulate them, whereas if you don't wanna play any instrument, you just put on the top 40 stuff and roll with it."
pinkfloyd,3axh95,redsox6,2,Wed Jun 24 20:44:29 2015 UTC,Not conceited at all man. I have to agree. We classic rockers just seem to be more open to music and understanding it.

I have a very similar story, except with the Beatles instead of Floyd. I am a diehard fan of the Fab Four and their music was similarly comforting and inspirational for me when I was suffering with depression. They made me want to learn guitar so I could play along with their songs. I also plan to do what you're doing with Floyd and listen to their entire catalogue in one day, maybe the anniversary of John meeting Paul.  I am just beginning to really explore Floyd's work. I got WYWH, DSOTM, and Piper on iTunes and look forward to giving all of them in-depth listens. At a planetarium, I saw a laser show synced with Dark Side and that was an amazing introduction to PF's music."
pinkfloyd,3axh95,redsox6,2,Thu Jun 25 20:34:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think you could have picked better albums to start listening to Floyd with, after you've listened to those three to death, either go to Animals and The Wall if you like their later stuff or check out Saucerful of Secrets and Meddle if you like their earlier stuff. Also check out Echoes Live at Pompeii if you've got a free half hour, it's a trip.  I just recently got into the Beatles and holy shit they're so good.  I used to think they were overrated, then I listened to Sgt. pepper's and I was hooked.  They're on the same level with floyd for me and I don't think any other band could top those two.  Not to mention they've got some crazy fun guitar stuff to play (Get back, Helter Skelter, Back in the USSR, Act naturally, etc)"
pinkfloyd,3axh95,julianwarsaw,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:14:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reassurance that I picked the right Floyd albums to start off with. Dark Side and WYWH seemed more approachable to a newbie, and I love psychedelic rock, so Piper was a no-brainer.   I have heard a lot of great things about that performance at Pompeii, really looking forward to watching it soon!  What are your favorite Beatles albums? I too started off with Sgt. Pepper, but to me Revolver and Abbey Road are their best. Some of their early stuff is really enjoyable too, With The Beatles and Beatles For Sale are my favorite Beatlemania-era records.  Radiohead is a great band to check out if you haven't already, I think their best four albums (The Bends, OK Computer, Kid A, In Rainbows) can hold their own with any band's best work."

pinkfloyd,3ayig8,TheCheshireCody,0,Wed Jun 24 16:21:47 2015 UTC,"He's not a terrible guitarist either. He's no Gilmour, but few are. He really needs to lay off the echo and distortion though."

Like he said he can play any guitar and amp, maybe a pedal or two and sound like himself.    I can do the same thing, except lacking in the fingers, at least I always sound like me though :)"
pinkfloyd,3ayig8,TheCheshireCody,2,Wed Jun 24 19:04:16 2015 UTC,"Snowy is about the only one that comes close to getting close to David.   If we're talking about the group ""guitarists who've played in Pink Floyd"", sure. ;-)  Clapton has an absolutely unique style, as does Satriani, Beck, Hendrix. Like, you always know it's them. There are other phenomenal guitarists, like Steve Morse, Eric Johnson, Buckethead or Stevie Ray Vaughan, who don't have 'unique' styles but are instead doing mind-blowing things with the instrument."
pinkfloyd,3ayig8,bolanrox,2,Wed Jun 24 19:10:16 2015 UTC,"DOnt forget Frank, Adrian or Robert Fripp :) You are right, the memorable ones all sound like themselves, and usually have a little good taste thrown in there :)"
pinkfloyd,3ayig8,TheCheshireCody,2,Wed Jun 24 19:16:49 2015 UTC,"My mind really went to solo guitarists, but you're absolutely right. Fripp and Zappa each invented a whole new language for guitar - Fripp through technology and Zappa just by thinking about sound and music differently than anyone had before. Belew is a genius, although I don't know that I'd tag him as having his own style as much as being a master of every style. There are definitely techniques, like his 'seagulls', that are his and his alone."
pinkfloyd,3ayig8,bolanrox,2,Wed Jun 24 19:22:18 2015 UTC,"Fair enough on Belew, anything he plays though he puts his stamp on,  there is a reason why everyone was fighting to get a hold of him."

Damn that was a fun show,  for some reason I always thought of Robert as being so serious, but he was grinning ear to ear the whole show joking around with the audience."
pinkfloyd,3ayig8,TheCheshireCody,2,Wed Jun 24 19:38:51 2015 UTC,"I saw them in 1995 or 1996 at the Count Basie Theatre in new Jersey. Great thing about that theater is you can stand at the beginning of the parking lot and see both the front entrance and the back door - the only two exits to the venue. My friend and I hung out for a while after the show and got to meet Pat Mastelotto, Bill Bruford and Tony Levin. It was the perfect end to a perfect show. I miss the double-trio. The post-ProjeKCt stuff I've never really dug as much. Power To Believe is okay but ConstruKction Of Light for some reason I find unpleasant to listen to.  I also got to see Tony and Pat play a private concert with Markus Reuter as The Stick Men. You want to hear some crazy guitar, check them out. Markus plays a touch guitar - basically the guitar equivalent of Levin's Chapman Stick bass - that he helped design. It is unlike anything I'd ever heard. I guess you've got to be pretty amazing if you're going to play guitar for guys who've worked with Belew."
pinkfloyd,3ayig8,bolanrox,2,Wed Jun 24 19:49:56 2015 UTC,"Mclaughlin, especially Miles era, is another huge influence on my playing,  though so is Miles, and Herbie."

pinkfloyd,3ayig8,TheCheshireCody,2,Thu Jun 25 05:41:08 2015 UTC,"The bulk of his sound was heavily copped from Hendrix, with a huge chunk of southern blues-rock added on top. Don't get me wrong, Stevie Ray Vaughan did it better than anyone else and was a phenomenal musician, but I don't think his style was any more unique than, say, Brian Setzer's."
pinkfloyd,3ayig8,hannibellecter,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:37:48 2015 UTC,"I think you need to go back farther then Hendrix, like Albert King for example (and to tie it in to this sub, Gilmour is very influenced by Albert King as well), but this is a Floyd sub so this is not the place for this discussion.  But I will say that I know it's him as soon as I hear the first note, and when Eric Clapton calls you one of the greatest blues guitarists ever and ""an open channel to the guitar gods"" I think you have a pretty unique sound."
pinkfloyd,3ayig8,bolanrox,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:19:21 2015 UTC,"Stevie is way more Albert than Jimi.  They did a jam together once and Stevie was copping everything Albert played spot on (Think it was from the Behind the Music episode).  Also agree, know its Stevie the second I hear him."

pinkfloyd,3ay7ik,bolanrox,3,Wed Jun 24 16:30:32 2015 UTC,"On a lot of these ""guest"" appearances, you can't even tell he's playing. I've never understood why you'd invite him to play but not feature at least one solo eg Grace Jones. Then there are a lot of average to crap songs that are only worth listening to because of his solo, eg The Elton John or Paul Young songs. Then there are the good songs with great solos of his featured. Those would include songs from, All About Eve, Berlin, Liona Boyd, Kate Bush, David Courtney (I actually think this is a very underrated song), Bryan Ferry, Roy Harper, Rod Stewart, Pete, Supertramp, Macca, Warren Zevon, The Orb & John Martyn.  The under appreciated 1975 David Cortney song When Your Life Is Your Own  The excellent Warren Zevon's Run Straight Down  The very long (for Supertramp) Brother Where You Bound  The 80's cheese factor is high on All About Eve's Wishing the Hours Away, and in lieu of having any great ideas for a solo David's drops some seriously heavy one note string bend tone bombs. I used the one from 3:13 to 3:18 as a ring tone for a long time. It's so heavy it just crushes the rest of the song."

pinkfloyd,3aurqa,Rooster_Ties,7,Tue Jun 23 17:53:50 2015 UTC,"What the hell is going on in this thread? Why is everyone getting downvoted?  It's documented fact that Wright had no creative input on MLOR and barely even appeared on it (he played a HUGE rule in the tour and persona of the band though).  After TFC, there was going to be a new Floyd album no matter what. Floyd's record company didn't even care what was on it (supposedly they were going to sue Roger if he didn't either make a new album or just leave, which resulted in him leaving and then suing them back). Gilmour made it clear to Waters that they would carry on with the band if he left, which they did.  As to whether the material on MLOR was intended for a Gilmour solo album - we simply don't know. There's no concrete source supporting or denying that. Gilmour didn't want to make another solo album (nobody went to his About Face concerts!) and their record company wanted a new Floyd album, not a new Gilmour album. After Profiles came out, it was only a matter of time."

It very well might have, though.   Yeah, the record company probably loved that Pink Floyd came back, but David made it pretty clear before Roger even left that he wanted to keep going, with or without Roger."
pinkfloyd,3aurqa,InMyBrokenChair,2,Tue Jun 23 19:08:29 2015 UTC,"Rick really did nothing on A Momentary Lapse, though. He wasn't technically in the band, he didn't write, and he wasn't on half of the songs."
pinkfloyd,3aurqa,InMyBrokenChair,3,Tue Jun 23 18:51:14 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Rick had nothing to do with AMLOR early on, and it's not even clear he played much on the studio recordings until pretty late in the process.  I'm team Dave, and love Rick -- but no matter how you look at it, AMLOR had almost no influence from Rick."
pinkfloyd,3aurqa,Wavyhill,2,Tue Jun 23 19:09:42 2015 UTC,"For that matter, it's debatable how much Nick actually played on the album. There are drum machines there for sure and little of his signature drum licks."
pinkfloyd,3aurqa,bolanrox,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:17:19 2015 UTC,"If I'm recalling correctly, Nick's chops weren't anywhere close to being up to it.  Really a shame, as that's probably the single biggest ""production""-related issue with the whole album, is the lack of Nick's drumming (or as much 'real' drumming, for that matter).  There's a lot I like about AMLOR, but even more I strongly dislike.  I've said it before, but EVERY time I listen to it, it's either ""surprisingly better"" or else ""much worse!"" than I remember it being from the last time I heard it.  (I only spin it about 4x per year, though I've been known to spin Side 2 a little more often than that.)  TL;DR:  There's lots to like and hate about every song on AMLOR, but the drum sounds and drumming is pretty weak throughout."

That plus ""The Moment of Clarity"" for the final two songs just pulls everything in the record together and explains it all.

There are an extra 5 seconds or so between the last song on the first side and the first song on the second side so you have time to turn the record over without breaking the sync.
pinkfloyd,3as1tm,mudo2000,3,Tue Jun 23 11:21:31 2015 UTC,"I think it's a unique release from Waters, especially for the time. In 1984, you'd expect wholly political statements from Waters, especially following The Final Cut, but this was a purely emotional album, focusing on a man's late night insecurities and his dreams running amok.   Musically, it has a raw character that is extremely unrefined compared to other Pink Floyd works, which is to be expected, it's Roger's first album that isn't tempered by Mason/Wright/Gilmour and he went a bit overboard with the concept, but from it arose some particularly badass moments. Sexual Revolution, Running Shoes, Arabs with Knives and West German Skies, and Go Fishing all have these powerful bombastic moments that would never have made it past the rest of PF but are truly incredible.  My only complaint is that one the title track Go fishing and Every Strangers eyes really function as discrete songs, every other one has some sort strange structure that works for the concept but make it difficult for me to introduce it to people who aren't used to it."

However, they could have done a better job documenting their live shows, particularly those in the 1970s.   Granted, it wasn't until the late 1980s that bands regularly released an album, went on tour,  & released a live album & video, but a number of bands did have concert films made in the 1970s. In recent years bands such as Led Zeppelin & The Who have released video of old concerts. Although there are numerous high quality bootlegs from the period, the video record of PF's classic tours is sorely lacking."

Reportedly the band wanted to have longer jams during the songs, but Norman Smith wanted to make them the next Beatles and insisted on keeping things short and poppy.    100%.  Live, they were doing extended jams, improvising, pure psychedelic/spacey rock.  To be far, the whimsical fantasy folky songwriting style is the way Syd would often write songs, as seen after Pink Floyd too.  But I wish there was more Astronomy Domine / Interstellar Overdrive on the album than Matilda Mother and Scarcrow.  Although there is a nice jam section to Matilda Mother.  I still love PATGOD though. So unique and so much character."
pinkfloyd,3arcpx,sacred-pepper,14,Mon Jun 22 22:32:12 2015 UTC,"See. I disagree with everybody saying Roger being so controlling. If Roger wasn't controlling, wish you were here would not be the same, animals wouldn't be the same, the was wouldn't even exist, and the final cut would not exist. I'm not saying his attitude was justified, I just think if he wasn't like that, things would be different. I think. I think the main mistakes are, rushing AMLOR, not releasing more golden era live albums, and not sucking up their damn egos and regrouping before Ricks death."

pinkfloyd,3arcpx,SomeRandomBuddy,6,Tue Jun 23 00:51:02 2015 UTC,"That's not how it went down.  Roger effectively 'left' immediately after TFC, long before anything was ever written for AMLOR.  Roger felt the band ceased to exist without him, so in a sense -- he never felt he left the band -- he felt the band no longer was a functioning entity without his involvement."
pinkfloyd,3arcpx,Rooster_Ties,3,Tue Jun 23 04:10:18 2015 UTC,"I understand that, and was generalizing a bit. What I meant was that clearly David had other ideas about the direction of content, which unveiled themselves when AMLOR was released. I don't particularly like most of the TFC, but based on what I know about Floyd, I would still prefer ANYTHING that came out with Roger involved, than the ""post-waters"" material."
pinkfloyd,3arcpx,SomeRandomBuddy,3,Tue Jun 23 16:56:05 2015 UTC,"The control-freak bassist/songwriter trope is pretty under appreciated, considering the 4 most highly regarded Pink Floyd albums and the last three Beatles albums were all made as a result of one."

David and Nick shouldn't have rushed A Momentary Lapse Of Reason. That could have been a classic if they gave it more time and thought.  None of them (especially Syd) should have used drugs.
pinkfloyd,3arcpx,InMyBrokenChair,12,Mon Jun 22 22:32:07 2015 UTC,None of them should have used drugs??? There would be no Pink Floyd as we know it without drugs. WTF are you talking about?

pinkfloyd,3arcpx,xour,4,Tue Jun 23 02:34:19 2015 UTC,"It would have changed Syd's life for the better. It would have helped him. I don't think any music after Syd was heavily influenced by drugs. Except for Comfortably Numb, buy that's not the drugs I'm talking about. It only would have helped the members. Drugs helped destroy Syd's life, David's marriage was destroyed by his addiction, and Rick's addiction destroyed his relationship with his family and indirectly contributed to Roger kicking him out. After Syd's music, drugs did nothing good for Pink Floyd."
pinkfloyd,3arcpx,InMyBrokenChair,2,Tue Jun 23 07:04:34 2015 UTC,"This is a tough one.  There is no doubt that their early music and recognition was at least in part from their musical style, and who knows if Syd would have found the same creativity / played the same style if he had not done psychedelics.  But honestly I would say no, probably not.  Or he might have lacked some of the ""style"" that made him such a pop star, which also aided in their recognition.  And without any of this, Pink Floyd would probably have never existed much past 1967 if at all.    Yeah I agree David and Rick shouldn't have got into cocaine.  Cocaine and LSD should not really be compared though."

pinkfloyd,3arcpx,SomeRandomBuddy,5,Tue Jun 23 03:29:20 2015 UTC,"Letting unreleased material moulder in the vaults.    Okay, maybe that's not fair entirely - there are probably legal and contractual reasons for some of it. But so many tracks - Vegetable Man, Scream Thy Last Scream, Lucy Leave etc - have circulated for years on poor quality bootlegs, with the band getting no revenue from them. That alone should be motivation enough...   Also, all the alternate versions of the soundtracks, the different versions that appeared in the films themselves, and the unique-to-the-film tracks like Seabirds.    And the ones that definitely got finished but never released - Peace Be With You springs to mind - and the alternate takes (The Hero's Return Part 2, that version of It Would Be So Nice, the 8-track version of Pigs On The Wing).    And as mentioned earlier - the live material. Tons of this exists on bootlegs and it's hard to imagine that there aren't at least some decent recordings gathering dust in the PF attic."

pinkfloyd,3arcpx,sacred-pepper,6,Tue Jun 23 05:21:10 2015 UTC,"Roger should have realised that quantity <> quality at an earlier stage, and realised that he was actually going to lose far more than the rest of the band by leaving.  Not that i minded - tens of thousands (including me) simply didn't notice he was missing when they started the concerts up again - compare that to the Berlin Wall concert, where it's painfully obvious how not-present the rest of the band are.  On top of that, I'm not sure the likes of High Hopes would have been better if he'd still been around to write different lyrics centering on his latest personal or political rantings (for example). I mean, if The Wall was semi-autobiographical, how could someone write an expose of how much of a monster they'd become and then carry on behaving as if they hadn't?"

You can have the original album sequence there, or go for a new sounds by switching them, without ruining it all. I think more people suggest switching them, however, so we'll see."

I already did a rough mix of this list, and the results were very good. If I had to change anything, I would probably remove Atom Heart Mother (or cut it down somewhat)."
pinkfloyd,3aptx3,Megalandrys,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:38:51 2015 UTC,"Really, I like his in all but the placing of BD/E, and that tips the scales in your favour, as in my opinion your placement is a little better. Will's placing of it was better than both (really ""Eclipse"" is a song that simply must end a section or (preferably) whole of an album. It just doesn't work differently, in my mind), but, while he made some other good decisions, the overall wasn't as good as yours, in my mind, so I listed it: You, Will, Cheater. It was a hard decision though; don't mug me for it."
pinkfloyd,3aptx3,MaxCHEATER64,2,Mon Jun 22 17:33:22 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the tracklist contains three (possibly four) ""ender"" tracks that don't work well with any song after it - the other two being High Hopes and Echoes. You can't reasonably separate Brain Damage from Eclipse, so in order to have the three enders actually be at the end Eclipse has to be first.  The only other possibility would be to have Brain Damage come after Echoes or High Hopes, which would sound even worse than High Hopes coming after Eclipse."
pinkfloyd,3aptx3,Megalandrys,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:43:34 2015 UTC,"True, but there is a certain way to do it. Will, I believe, put ""Comfortably Numb"" after ""Echoes"", somewhere in the middle of the album. It isn't perfect, but the end of ""Echoes"" could reasonably lead into ""Comfortably Numb"" (and now that I think about it, ""Comfortably Numb"" could end an album, being the end of a side and fading out, unlike ""Mother"", ""Outside the Wall"", and ""Goodbye Cruel World"" already, just like ""Echoes"" and ""High Hopes""). But Eclipse has too much space after it ends to do anything but end an album. I can't see it having a smooth transition into anything. I could see ""High Hopes"" going, and then ""Echoes"", (like you did, and see, that's good, but I don't see ""Eclipse"" leading into ""High Hopes"". Despite what you said, I'd rather see ""Echoes"" into ""Brain Damage"") and then either put ""Brain Damage/Eclipse"" there (which wouldn't sound the best), or go ahead and add in a filler track or two (""Comfortably Numb"" picks up the slack off ""Echoes"", but you'd need something to pick up its fade-out).  This goes to show why I voted /u/PinkFloydJoe's higher; it has little sections, 'sides', and ""Comfortably Numb"" ends one, BD/E ends another, and ""Echoes"" ends it all. The only thing that leaves something to be desired (though it's quite big) is this:   Us and Them  High Hopes  Wot's... Uh The Deal"

Roger Waters was told to ''shoot himself'' by his school teacher as a child.  The Pink Floyd musician revealed his tutor confronted him in class as a youngster and told him he would never do anything valuable with his life because he was ''useless''.  He recalled:   ''I've had some measure of success and there's no question that it provides one with something of a bulwark against T.E House who was the asshole at my grammar school who told me I was a complete fucking idiot.""  ''He was an English teacher and he was my form master when I was 13.""  ''He said I would never become anything and might as well give up and shoot myself because I was useless. He liked tidy hand-writing and a*slickers and I had neither of those attributes, so we didn't get on at all.''   The 71-year-old progressive rock legend - who will release documentary film 'Roger Waters The Wall' later this year - revealed he preferred to stick to the shadows and be left alone as a teenager.  Speaking to The Sun newspaper, he explained:   ''When I was a young man, my wall manifested itself in an attitude, the image I have of myself is, if I was in this room, I'd be in one of the corners. I'd be dressed in black.""  ''I'd have a cigarette hanging out of the corner of my mouth and my expression would be one of fuck off, leave me alone.''"

pinkfloyd,3ai7yb,_JackWilshere,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:56:11 2015 UTC,Out of interest who would be in your top three song writers? For me it would be    Jim Morrison/The Doors Roger Waters Kurt Cobain

pinkfloyd,3ajsei,c6030315,2,Sun Jun 21 02:46:20 2015 UTC,"Just buy the album then. It has been released in 2014, but this has been largely ignored by the three most important Pink Floyd fan-sites, supposedly after some mild persuasion from One Fifteen not to write about it. Yeah, call me a Barrett conspiracy wacko.  The Holy Church of Iggy the Inuit is, as far as I know, the only blog that extensively wrote about this release, with the world's first review and interviews with Twink, Fred Frith and Carlton from Easy Records (who published the album and who is deeply disappointed with the sales figures).  Last Minute Put Together Boogie Band"
pinkfloyd,3aj2l7,PinkFloydBot,14,Sat Jun 20 18:00:36 2015 UTC,"Great song. I feel like this is the model for what TDB represented in the history of the band. In 1994, Pink Floyd was 29 years old, it had lost two members for good. The band was old, its members were old, and their sound was not filled with psychedelic energy or angry protest the way it used to be. This relaxed, uplifting sound is the product of 29 years of Pink Floyd."

pinkfloyd,3aj2l7,Torquemada1970,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:45:31 2015 UTC,"A middle-aged rocker is just enough past his prime that he either calms down or gets really mature in his protest. David or Roger essentially. The early 90's marked both this album and Roger's most refined political work yet, Amused to Death."

pinkfloyd,3aj2l7,maakuz,7,Sat Jun 20 19:28:05 2015 UTC,That brief synth solo in the bridge is one of the finest moments on The Division Bell.  It's just so emotive.  Classic Richard Wright.
pinkfloyd,3aj2l7,Robotman1974,8,Sat Jun 20 20:28:49 2015 UTC,"I think the narrator is the bad guy, or at least a flawed character. And he's the same character singing Keep Talking.  In Coming Back To Life, the idea is that the narrator (David) is left alone by the person he's addressing. He's a bit angry about being left like that. Then he makes the best of it and starts doing better. But I also get the sense that the narrator is doing the same to the other person that the other person did to him. The other person wasn't there when the narrator was ""burned and broken"". Then, in the song, the narrator doesn't care about the other person either. He ""heads straight into the shining sun"". The entire thing comes off a bit selfish. I think they made it sound that way on purpose, in order to make a point about the way we treat each other. David's character thinks everything is going so great in Coming Back To Life, and is a hypocrite about the way he treats people. Then it all comes crashing down in Keep Talking.  The best evidence for all this is a shared lyric between Coming Back To Life and Keep Talking. The narrator says ""the things you say and the things you do surround me"". Then the narrator leaves the other person. So then he doesn't know what the other person is saying or doing. So, ""there's a silence surrounding me"".  My interpretation might be a stretch, but those lines have to be related somehow."

pinkfloyd,3aiyuy,babelfish_ny,5,Sun Jun 21 16:36:33 2015 UTC,"It is a one night special occurrence with a live interview after the show with Roger and Nick.  I think that's probably why.  I'm going to the show and then buying the inevitable blu-ray release but why wouldn't you want to see it in a theater full of Floyd freaks and share the experience.  If money is really tight or transportation is a hassle or you're on the younger side of the sub-reddit (I mean like 16 and under) I can understand your concerns but if none of those apply to you I think you are just over-thinking it at this point.  It's The Wall on a huge screen in a theater of your fellow Floyd fans w/ live interview after.  Really, it's a no-brainer.  Go to the show and feel the warmth, thrill of confusion - that space cadet glow."

It does indeed sound good, but be warned that the US release has the UmmaGumma Astronomy Domine rather than the proper version with Syd. The transition from Interstellar Overdrive to Gnome is also changed to a fade-out.  Thirdly, the first pressing uses the US single version of Flaming.

Though it's slightly annoying that they spread it out to two discs, it does help the audio quality as there's no inner groove distortion.  However, if you're someone that strictly pays for all music, I'd certainly consider getting the CD+Blu set, because the bonus tracks are really one of the good parts of this release. Also, many of the LPs releases have slightly warped first discs, due to the inclusion of the photo book. Mine is warped, but plays fine."

David performed this on his solo tour in 1984, and also when he was part of Pete Townshend's Deep End in 1985 and 1986. This is the last time it was ever performed live (by David): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPLP1R_9qp4 (notice how he changes the first word from she to he... I wonder who that can be a reference to...)  The script for the music video for this (already linked to by someone else in this thread) was written by David Gilmour and Storm Thorgerson.  The final version which appears on the album is a combination of two recordings: a regular studio recording, and a live jam in Pathe-Marconi Studios in Paris.  Steve Winwood plays Hammond on this.  The spoken bit at the end: ""I'm not awfully good at this funky sort of thing, but umm... sometimes, when the inspiration strikes, I can get down with the best of them""."

pinkfloyd,3a8uj7,idapitbwidiuatabip,7,Thu Jun 18 05:10:37 2015 UTC,"well fuck me  that sounds interesting.  Around 11 minutes or any point where the percussion goes away, some of the cacophony dies out and you can hear bits and pieces of instrumentation from all the tracks at once.  EDIT:  From around 13 minutes on, it gets really interesting.  Really comes together towards the end.  Turns out it's part of an album of his called The Sound Of... Volume 06 which has similar tracks focusing on Kansas, Genesis, and Jefferson Airplane.    It's part of a series he's doing that's meant to showcase the entire 'sound' of a band.  Volume 5 does Dead Kennedy's, Black Flag, Negazione, and Charles Bronson  Volume 4 does Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Thin Lizzy, and Queen.  Volume 3 does Abba, Beegees, Eagles, and Boston.  Volume 2 does The Beatles, The Who, The Doors, Os Mutantes.  and Volume 1 does Bathory, Carcass, Death, and Pantera.  Damn I'mma have to check more of these out.  EDIT 2:  OK based on listening to the Queen and the Doors one, he seems to be selecting one track from each album and then overlaying them all -- as the shorter tracks end, the other ones become more audible until you can hear the ends of some of the final ones.  On the Doors one, after 'When the Music's Over,' all that remains playing is 'The End,' which was their longest track.    Pink Floyd, however -- had some comparatively consistent track lengths and structures.  It'd be interesting to try out this same experiment with post-rock."

Kind of like the album Grayfolded by John Oswald. He took over 100 versions of Dark Star by the Grateful Dead between '68 and '93 and combined them in to an almost 2 hour masterpiece of sound. Very cool but probably tough to listen to if you're not into the Grateful Dead. I feel like something like this could be done with all the Pink Floyd albums and be turned in to a beautiful, though provoking piece of music."

pinkfloyd,3aamho,AleciaQou,2,Thu Jun 18 15:34:06 2015 UTC,"A Momentary Lapse Of Reason (besides The Dogs Of War, which probably shouldn't have been there at all) is about being alone. Think about it: Learning To Fly is about a ""misfit"" out there on his own. On The Turning Away is about the way people don't care about others, leaving them alone. Yet Another Movie is a weird song, but one of the things it shows is a guy who beats his wife and how that hurts him. A New Machine is about someone isolated somehow (possibly in a cryogenic chamber, I think). Sorrow is about a guy who is lonely and regretful. The phrase ""one [noun]"" (one world, one slip, one sound, one kiss, one soul) is used a bunch of times to stress the theme of singularity. So the theme of One Slip fits right in: how a romantic relationship can turn bad and how the subsequent isolation hurts. The last line from the last verse is very important to the album, showing one of the ways we react to loneliness: ""the year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone"". They're desperate not to remain isolated, so they get back together even if it's not really what they should do. I don't like the poppy sound. The slap bass is unforgivable. But it fits.  Take It Back is similar. Every song on The Division Bell is about communication, interactions, and their consequences. Even the instrumentals tie in. Take It Back, at its core, is about a relationship, kind of like the one from One Slip. But Take It Back is also a metaphor for the way humanity treats the planet. ""Her love rains down on me as easy as the breeze""... this continues throughout the song. I think it's clever.  I particularly like the line ""I was thinking all about her, burning with rage and desire, we were spinning into darkness, and the earth was on fire"". At first, it seems that ""burning with rage and desire"" is describing the speaker as he thinks ""all about her"", but it's actually describing her as he thinks about her. So it says ""she"" was burning, then in the next line says that ""the earth was on fire"". It's wordplay. Also, the earth is continuously ""spinning into darkness"", so that line is good as well.  Just like A Great Day Of Freedom relates personal interaction to international politics, Take It Back relates personal interaction to environmental destruction. It helps get the album's point across.  Now, just like with One Slip, the sound isn't great. It's a little too poppy. I don't mind the Edge-like guitar (which is actually the wrong way of putting it, since The Edge based that style on one of Gilmour's styles), and I like the E-Bow, but it is a bit of a generic sound. I think the lyrics are clever, though, and that it adds to The Division Bell."
pinkfloyd,3aamho,InMyBrokenChair,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:01:12 2015 UTC,"I have often thought of One Slip and Take it Back as the chronological depictions of stages in one relationship.   First, there's that passionate, primal and instinctual response between two people who experience an immediate attraction, in One Slip. It's that visceral attraction, that ""binds a life to a life."" Later, as the relationship becomes fixed, and true bonds are established, there's the inner panic and fear of how empty it would feel if that bond were broken by the one we care so much about as described in Take it Back.   Take it Back, is a thoughtful description of the self fulfilling prophecy that compels us to act badly toward those we love because we are afraid of losing them. We, essentially, drive them away and then say: ""Ha, I knew it.""   I realize that TDB, as a whole, is about communication and a reminder that if we hope to avoid the tragic consequence of a lost relationship, we have to ""Keep Talking.""   Although I do understand the message of TDB and enjoy it, as well as AMLOR, immensely, I still feel that both One Slip and Take It Back, are among the least ""Pink Floyd"" sounding songs that the band has recorded."

It's just that since I've been visiting this sub, I've noticed that there often comments made by those who don't believe that Pink Floyd is truly Pink Floyd without Roger Waters. As I was thinking about that, it occurred to me to post the two songs that I felt most supported that argument. That is, in no way, to suggest that I find Pink Floyd lacking without Roger Waters, what's noticeably absent, at times, are some of the more lofty elements his image conjuring abilities.   As I've mentioned many times, on this sub alone, every time I hear David Gilmour/Pink Floyd perform, my respect only deepens for their amazing talent and abilities.

pinkfloyd,3aamho,SonOfNothingsReturn,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:54:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know about individual songs, but both AMLOR and TDB are clearly missing a clear ""concept,"" imo. If you listen to them front to back, they don't sound as cohesive as their other albums. Not that I don't enjoy both quite a bit."
pinkfloyd,3aamho,GamerTyke,7,Thu Jun 18 23:15:27 2015 UTC,"Well, TDB has a central theme: Communication"
pinkfloyd,3aamho,GamerTyke,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:10:42 2015 UTC,"That's true, however I don't think it really flows musically as well as it could/should."
pinkfloyd,3aamho,hannibellecter,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:23:32 2015 UTC,"While I agree that TDB doesn't flow as well as albums like Dark Side, I would argue that it does flow better than some of Floyd's best including Meddle and OBC. OBC in particular (at least partially due to its being a soundtrack). Not that those are worse albums, I just find it easier to listen to TDB as a single, cohesive piece of music than I do those two."
pinkfloyd,3aamho,Torquemada1970,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:23:10 2015 UTC,"I think it's more stylistically consistant than Meddle/AHM/etc, yeah."
pinkfloyd,3aamho,Torquemada1970,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:51:01 2015 UTC,"Roger Waters was highly critical of both of them, as well. Waters, called TDB: ""Just rubbish...nonsense from beginning to end.""  While I don't think it's quite that bad, the lack of cohesion is definitely a problem. In my opinion, that lack of ""clear concept"" is most pronounced in AMLOR although it contains some very meaningful single tracks."
pinkfloyd,3aamho,wasushi,3,Thu Jun 18 21:17:45 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. I wouldn't mind ""A New Machine"" if I knew what the fuck it was supposed to accomplish."
pinkfloyd,3aamho,GroovingPict,2,Thu Jun 18 16:23:02 2015 UTC,"I know, it's like: Okay, what's your point?"
pinkfloyd,3aamho,GroovingPict,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:30:36 2015 UTC,"Do you have the quote because I think he said that about AMLOR when it came out and the battle between them was at its highest point.  I do know he has lambasted the lyrics for both albums, and while there are a few songs i disagree with him (Sorrow for example) basically he is right.  Roger has written more profound sentences then the entirety of those records lyrics.  But honestly I listen to those ""new"" Floyd records for the music and that amazing guitar.  David could get up and just sing out of the phone book and his voice and guitar work would carry it."
pinkfloyd,3aamho,GroovingPict,2,Thu Jun 18 16:40:16 2015 UTC,"Here is the quote: ""With all due respect to the people who went out and bought those records, they are just rubbish. Particularly The Division Bell; it's just nonsense from beginning to end. A Momentary Lapse of Reason had a couple of really nice tunes on it that, had I still been in the band, those chord sequences and melodies would have been made it onto a record that I was involved in. But conceptually and lyrically, it's just rubbish, partly because it's not true. It's like, ""Let's try and write songs that sound as if they're Pink Floyd and make records that sound like Pink Floyd records."" It's from this interview and is also quoted in ""Rough Guide To Pink Floyd"" by Toby Manning (2006)."
pinkfloyd,3aamho,hannibellecter,2,Thu Jun 18 21:12:49 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but I hold the lyrics to High Hopes as more relevant than Time now I'm the wrong side of 40..."

pinkfloyd,3aamho,Torquemada1970,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:20:07 2015 UTC,"Take it Back could be about returning a piece of clothing that doesn't fit. I specifically said that these songs didn't ""rely as heavily"" on metaphor or symbolism not that they don't contain any. The lyrics are straightforward and there's nothing wrong with that. They are simply lyrics that everyone knows Roger Waters wouldn't write."

pinkfloyd,3a9h0z,woodard2112,22,Thu Jun 18 07:53:20 2015 UTC,"Definitely Meddle. Atom Heart Mother is another good alternative. If you're not into any 23 minute long behemoths of songs though (but you should be), then I suggest The Division Bell!"
pinkfloyd,3a9h0z,supermonkie90,3,Thu Jun 18 08:03:39 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'm about to look up the full Meddle album on YouTube right now
pinkfloyd,3a9h0z,RB26TT,4,Thu Jun 18 17:07:49 2015 UTC,One of these days is quiet a relaxing song :)

pinkfloyd,3a9h0z,DylanFloyd,2,Thu Jun 18 08:26:31 2015 UTC,"Certainly the most laid back. Not intense at all, but if you're lookng for something with substance (sorry, even though I loved TER, I found it bland) I would suggest either The Division Bell or Momentary Lapse of Reason. Basically, anything after The Final Cut is recommended for this criteria."
pinkfloyd,3a9h0z,Tactical_Lemon,10,Thu Jun 18 08:32:15 2015 UTC,"Obscured by Clouds or Meddle.  Meddle has a few easy-going songs and then one 23-minute long epic. ObC has a lot of easy going songs, one or two 'harder' songs, and a few instrumentals. I'd start there if I were you."
pinkfloyd,3a9h0z,Blizz310,5,Thu Jun 18 10:03:05 2015 UTC,"Meddle.  If it's too upbeat and energetic, skip the opening the track.  The rest as absolutely relaxing, and excellent."
pinkfloyd,3a9h0z,CharterMage,5,Thu Jun 18 14:03:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely Bring the Boys back home off of the Wall. It's so incredible! I even have it as my alarm, so relaxing to wake up too"
pinkfloyd,3a9h0z,Megalandrys,3,Thu Jun 18 19:08:35 2015 UTC,BRIIING THE BOOOOOOYYS BACK HOOOOOOOOOOME  So relaxing
pinkfloyd,3a9h0z,CharterMage,4,Fri Jun 19 21:18:50 2015 UTC,I always go for Animals but I just realized it's probably not relaxing at all for most people lol
pinkfloyd,3a9h0z,GristleCZ,2,Thu Jun 18 15:05:57 2015 UTC,"""Dogs"", a little. And parts of ""Sheep"". The verses of ""Sheep"" and ""Pigs"" at all, I may find somewhat relaxing/easy to listen to but I doubt people would agree."
pinkfloyd,3a9h0z,GristleCZ,4,Thu Jun 18 15:32:02 2015 UTC,Dogs is definitely the first one I had in mind. I used to fall asleep to that song every night.
pinkfloyd,3a9h0z,pinkfloydfan4life,3,Thu Jun 18 15:45:12 2015 UTC,For me it's a definitely Division Bell.
pinkfloyd,3a9h0z,hobbes03,2,Thu Jun 18 10:59:25 2015 UTC,"I'll check it out, the only song I recognize is High Hopes, which is actually one of my favorite PF songs!"

pinkfloyd,3a9h0z,freezepop28,3,Thu Jun 18 18:38:17 2015 UTC,"Cluster One is absolutely amazing as well, Rick Wright was truly a great."
pinkfloyd,3a9h0z,KIMrPickle,2,Thu Jun 18 22:45:58 2015 UTC,"While agreeing with Meddle and Endless River, I'd throw Wish You Were Here into the mix - if there were a way to listen just to Shine on You Crazy Diamond, straight through, parts I-IX (or if you 'removed' Have a Cigar and Welcome to the Machine (the latter being one of my fav PF songs, so the suggestion is otherwise blasphemy).    But Diamond I-V, followed by the title track, followed by Diamond VI-IX, would have to be super relaxing."

pinkfloyd,3a6t4t,wasushi,7,Wed Jun 17 18:29:23 2015 UTC,"I've never been shy about being a Watersboy, but this track here simply proves that Rog can make you feel something. TFC is such an heartbreaker, even the screaming punch of Not Now John is an emotional ride.  But Gunner's is just something else. It's a man telling a story about hope and love as he dies a horrible, screaming death."
pinkfloyd,3a6t4t,extraflux,6,Wed Jun 17 23:07:09 2015 UTC,Definitely my favorite song on the Final Cut and definitely one of my top favorite songs. There is nothing about it I don't love.
pinkfloyd,3a6t4t,__________________l,4,Wed Jun 17 18:59:49 2015 UTC,"Two of the most impressive vocal PF performances of all time on one song. Roger's voice synthesizing with the saxophone seamlessly, and then the mind-blowing scream. Best song on TFC."
pinkfloyd,3a6t4t,Fcorange5,3,Wed Jun 17 20:12:58 2015 UTC,"This is one of my absolute favorite Floyd songs.  My interpretation is these are the thoughts of a soldier as he is dying on the battle field, about how his Mom will mourn him at his funeral, about all the things that the world should be but isn't, and then at the end as he slips into death."
pinkfloyd,3a6t4t,Dimsdale53,3,Wed Jun 17 21:44:12 2015 UTC,"The line about maniacs blowing holes in bandsmen by remote control, refers to the IRA who detonated a bomb in Hyde Park, and another in Regent's Park, on July 20 1982, killing a total of 11 people. In particular it refers to the Regent's Park bomb where the 7 killed were bandsmen of the Royal Green Jackets.  In addition to the three Pink Floyd members, Michael Kamen (piano), Raphael Ravenscroft (sax), and The National Philharmonic Orchestra, appear on the track."

It's like they speak the same emotional cosmic musical language as Pink Floyd while, sometimes, adding a bit of classic metal.   Here are a few of their amazing songs.   Mooncalf  Aramanu   Space Out  Oakum  Shima Koto  Paper Monkeys  Sunrise Jam  Erpsongs  Vibuthi  Aura Borealis  Cat DNA  Eternal Wheel"

pinkfloyd,3a6olj,listenupuk,2,Wed Jun 17 17:34:02 2015 UTC,"Really. ""Time"" may in fact be Pink Floyd's best song ever. As he said himself in the description, ""missed a couple squealies, had a few out of tune bends, and had a slight fumble near the end"", but it was still great.  The ""Comfortably Numb"" solo comes very close though, both are overused for this, but it's true. I don't see why people rank it, as Floyd's best songs, 3. ""Time"" (if that much, sometimes 4), 2. ""Comfortably Numb"", 1. ""Wish You Were Here"". I love both of the two songs in front, but ""Wish You Were Here"" is overrated. It's beautiful in every way, true, but they've made better songs; ""Comfortably Numb"" and ""Time are some of those songs, falling into 2. and 1. for me respectively.  Non-Pink Floyd solos that come close would be the solo (well, entire outro, really) that this indie band Team Me plays on their like 8 minute track ""Favourite Ghost"" at live concerts. The original is good, but the outro is always just soul-crushingly good live. Uno's part (the guitar you first hear, around 13:51) actually I think is the first song I learned to play on the guitar all the way through, and with little-to-no mistakes. The other two solos are of course ""Hotel California"" and ""Stairway to Heaven"".  But I've gotten on a long tangent."
pinkfloyd,3a6olj,MaxCHEATER64,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:48:03 2015 UTC,"Nah man, Time is good but it isn't the best. Echoes has it beat. It does in thirty-seconds and seven notes what Comfortably Numb or Time takes 3+ minutes to accomplish and some of the most complex guitarwork this side of jazz fusion."
pinkfloyd,3a6olj,Endxsor,2,Wed Jun 17 18:03:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Echoes is the best imo. The fusion of the jazzy organ, funky bass and drums and the psychedelic guitar work in the ""funky"" part after the first 2 verses is just perfect"

I have a copy on my phone, the CD in my truck, a version on my home media server, vinyl in my library, etc.   I saw the '84 tour with Clapton as a teen - Pros and Cons resonated with me early in my life and has been with me ever since. It is easily one of my favorite Waters works, and also (IMO) one of the best things Clapton ever recorded. Musically, it fits everything I look for in a single composition.   The story has everything - joy, tragedy, romance, pain, love, disappointment, self-discovery - in my opinion, one of the best pieces of artistic expression I've ever had the pleasure of being exposed to. As far as a soundtrack, I can honestly say that it has helped me avoid some situations where it could have become applicable.

Edit: http://collectorsfrenzy.com/details/110490106657/Pink_Floyd__Im_a_King_Bee__acetate__ACETATE__VG Shows the acetate saying simply ""Pink Floyd"", unlike their first released single, coming later, saying ""The Pink Floyd"". And also according to my ridiculously reliable sources, they weren't called The Pink Floyd Sound until late 1965, also after Klose quit the band. Another link I found, but lost, said ""Lucy Leave"" was the one recorded later, in late '65, still with Klose, but that doesn't match up with my ridiculously reliable source's sources saying he left mid '65.

pinkfloyd,3a3jyg,Megalandrys,3,Wed Jun 17 18:17:13 2015 UTC,It just feels good to me. It's definitely something that I would listen to a whole album of. I only detected AHM but the Eagles do sound like an influence here. I think that Comfortably Numb has a heavier guitar sound though
pinkfloyd,3a3jyg,will_wolfy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:34:14 2015 UTC,"Definitely, a lot more distortion and such, but I mean the notes in particular, and the rhythm, but yeah.  I'd buy that album. Especially if he can write decent lyrics and sing just half well."
pinkfloyd,3a3jyg,Megalandrys,3,Wed Jun 17 19:13:32 2015 UTC,"Even if he had to have someone else write/sing, as long as it sounds fitting, I'd go for it"
pinkfloyd,3a3jyg,will_wolfy,2,Wed Jun 17 19:39:27 2015 UTC,Indeed.

pinkfloyd,39ylmu,mrw412,5,Mon Jun 15 21:10:27 2015 UTC,Thanks for posting.  Made my day!  Its the first Floyd album I purchased as a kid.  Wow the feels watching that.

pinkfloyd,39x3kb,ThisIsMyNewUserID,17,Mon Jun 15 14:43:56 2015 UTC,"So, all (most) of Dark Side, all of Wish You Were Here, arguably some of the best parts of The Wall, AHM Suite, all (most) of Animals, two of everyone's favorite songs on Meddle, one song from the Gilmour led-era (""High Hopes""), and ""Wot's. . .Uh the Deal?""  I must say, I'm only disappointed that nothing, nothing from the Barrett-era and none of the couple worthy songs on TFC made it on (roughly half the album is good, imo)."
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,Megalandrys,7,Mon Jun 15 16:42:00 2015 UTC,I'm thinking maybe after this we should do a side-project for pre dark side and post the wall era music only.
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,Megalandrys,7,Mon Jun 15 18:35:56 2015 UTC,"I came up with weird, dumb idea, you could have two 25 track albums, one a greatest hits, and I guess the underdogs for the second, lol? Like the box-set thing, you could have one named ""Oh, by the way..."" and the other ""...which one's Pink?"" or something like that, to tie them together. That'd be funny and cool, in my opinion.  Edit: And I guess you'd vote for it the same way we did this one, only remove every song on here, and maybe make it where on the bigger albums (TER and The Wall) you can only vote for a certain number of their tracks. But that'd make a need for more, and more complex vote blocs."
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,Megalandrys,3,Mon Jun 15 18:46:07 2015 UTC,"That's an awesome idea!  I'll tell you what, put together a tracklist for this album and throw this at the bottom as a justification and I'll make sure it's included with the suggestions on which we vote later this week or next.    Based on the other comments in this thread and the level of participation thus far I'd wager that this community would be quite keen on following this up with another project akin to that which you have suggested.  I know I am.  If you want to bounce some tracklist ideas off me before you formally submit one, please do!"
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,arcainzor,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:27:02 2015 UTC,"I shall, then."
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,mrw412,14,Mon Jun 15 21:18:39 2015 UTC,"Kinda surprised to see no representation of the earlier (and later) albums, but I guess these are Floyd's /best/ songs, although maybe not the most interesting ones.  EDIT: Also this is why I wanted to do the votes like the top 10s on /r/indieheads, this was bound to happen."
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,arcainzor,4,Mon Jun 15 15:24:14 2015 UTC,We should have another poll like how /u/arcainzor says and then take the results  from that and match it up with the results from the current poll and decide between those two.
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,arcainzor,0,Mon Jun 15 21:54:55 2015 UTC,"Let's talk a little more about this vote mechanism and I'll make a post about it.  To your knowledge, is it just a ""regular"" post to which everyone replies with their top 10 whatevers, at which point the author of the post then manually calculates based on the formula you expressed in the other thread?  Or is there a special ""contest mode"" type of posting or something like that?"
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,arcainzor,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:55:37 2015 UTC,"Basically just what you said. Everyone posts their top 10, giving the tracks descending points from 10 to 1. Votes are then tallied up, you could probably ask a mod over at /r/indieheads whether they do it manually or not. As everyone makes their own post, upvotes and downvotes do not count, and so there is no need for contest mode.  I can note that we used to do it in contest mode based om votes, but got much better results with this new method."
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,arcainzor,0,Tue Jun 16 21:27:15 2015 UTC,"I don't mind running one of these, but my only concern is that there really weren't many songs outside that era in striking distance of the list.  Mother, Run Like Hell, and Wot's . . .uh the deal all had 26 votes.  The next three on the list are 2 votes behind each and only one of those is from the Syd era.  There are three songs behind that with 3 less votes than the bottom three songs and a couple more within 5 from the bottom of the list and all but one of those is from outside the mainly represented era but everything else is pretty far out of contention from the very bottom of the list and nowhere close to contention beyond the last three spots.    Point of all that is that I can't imagine much changing in the list that wouldn't be attributed to the level of participation."
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,SonOfNothingsReturn,2,Wed Jun 17 17:15:43 2015 UTC,"You might very well be right, but I feel it's worth a try. Could consider having minimums for each album as well, might do another poll for that."
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,arcainzor,0,Wed Jun 17 17:23:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I put the minimums for each album question in the first poll.  Well, I asked if each album should have  mandatory representation on the final product and it was an overwhelming ""no.""  Just for the sake of argument I put together what the tracklist would look like if every album had to have at least 1 song based off the highest vote getters per album, which takes up 16 of the 25 tracks obviously, and filled the other 9 with the highest vote getters regardless of album:   Comfortably Numb Shine On you Crazy Diamond Parts I-V Dogs Echoes Wish You Were Here Time Brain Damage Us and Them Hey You Breathe Shine On You Crazy Diamond Parts VI-XI High Hopes Eclipse Pigs (Three Different Ones) Sheep Atom Heart Mother Wot's. . .Uh the Deal? Learning to Fly Careful with that Axe Eugene Set the Controls for the Heart of . . . Interstellar Overdrive The Final Cut It's What we Do Green Is the Colour Baby Lemonade   In other words the album would lose Have a Cigar, Money, The Great Gig in The Sky,  Welcome to the machine, Another Brick in the Wall Part 2, One of These Days, Mother, and Run Like Hell in favor of Learning to Fly, Careful with that Axe Eugene, Set the Controls For the Heart of the Sun, Intersellar Overdrive, The Final Cut, It's What We Do, Green Is the Colour, and Baby Lemonade.  Not sure where that lands with anyone, but that's a model of how it would probably be if we did it that way."
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,InMyBrokenChair,2,Wed Jun 17 18:48:26 2015 UTC,"Well, we'll never have a tracklist that will satisfy everyone, but it we could try it with a new polling and then vote between the two set of tracks.  EDIT: Also I don't feel like the solo records necessarily should have mandatory representation like with the last few tracks."
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,Kshaard,-1,Wed Jun 17 19:00:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know what I think about that idea.  On one hand, I personally wouldn't mind more diverse album representation but on the other hand I don't want to introduce unnecessary time additions toward the end product when the community already voted on whether or not to make mandatory album represenation and the result was pretty lopsided.  Additionally, based on past experience with these things, the longer they take the more participation and interest tanks.  Many projects have died on the vine for lack of speedy enough resolution and I don't want that to happen here.  My instinct is to just push forward with the current tracklist rather than add time to revote for something that's already been polled.  If there is a subset of the community unhappy with the result we can do another down the road with different rules."
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,TheCatsBananas,2,Wed Jun 17 20:36:54 2015 UTC,"You're the guy in charge, so whatever works for you."
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,__________________l,7,Wed Jun 17 20:45:52 2015 UTC,I feel like it makes sense to add On The Run and Any Colour You Like seeing as you already have 7/9 of Dark Side. Maybe the same for Animals too.
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,MaxCHEATER64,5,Mon Jun 15 16:04:21 2015 UTC,Not sure if it's necessary considering how it's doubtful that we're just going to play them all chronologically.
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,Megalandrys,8,Mon Jun 15 16:19:40 2015 UTC,"Because fuck Syd, right?  Edit: We should have had minimums for each era, not each album. Like, a minimum of two for Syd, a minimum of four for 1968-1972, a minimum of two for the '80s, and a minimum of two for 1994-2014. Then fifteen for the big four."
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,InMyBrokenChair,3,Mon Jun 15 18:15:16 2015 UTC,I noticed that too.  Maybe after this project we can set up a pre-darkside/post-wall version or something.
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,PinkFloydJoe,3,Mon Jun 15 18:30:15 2015 UTC,"This was bound to happen, as this whole project was basically to find Pink Floyd's most-top-25ed songs. And, aside from Echoes, the biggest proportion of fans would consider that to be their best period for songwriting."
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,mrw412,5,Mon Jun 15 16:32:14 2015 UTC,"It's a bit disappointing for there to be only one song from the first 5 albums. I suppose the majority has spoken, but this seems like a rather generic compilation. Although I must say thanks for putting the time into arranging it."

pinkfloyd,39x3kb,Fcorange5,4,Tue Jun 16 05:31:11 2015 UTC,Where is the Final Cut!?
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,Megalandrys,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:41:48 2015 UTC,It seems like pre Dark Side and Post Wall era Floyd is just below the fold.
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,Fcorange5,5,Mon Jun 15 18:06:11 2015 UTC,"For this list I'm assuming that Breathe includes Speak to Me (as it does in most releases of the album since the 90s) and that ABITW2 includes THDOUL (no release of that song in all of history has ever NOT included THDOUL). I'm also assuming that every song is in its original studio form and isn't being truncated in any way. Finally, I'm assuming that, like Echoes, the songs will be slightly altered to create a fluent transition between each track.  Here's the order I'm proposing:   Breathe Dogs One of These Days Time The Great Gig in the Sky Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Parts I-V Welcome to the Machine Mother Wot's... uh the Deal? Have a Cigar Wish You Were Here Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Parts VI-IX Run Like Hell Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2 Atom Heart Mother Hey You Money Us and Them Sheep Pigs (Three Different Ones) Comfortably Numb Brain Damage Eclipse High Hopes Echoes      There's only a few things that I'd say are really important in regards to placement - ""Echoes"" will only work as the last track, ""Breathe"" will only work as the first, either ""Hey You"" or ""Money"" should come after ""Atom Heart Mother"" (AHM has a huge 'finale', so you'd need to follow it up with a song designed to be a follow up to something big - using AHM as a natural 'divider' of the album into two halfs, each of which roughly contain either 'openers' or 'closers' seems logical to me). ""Have a Cigar"" being immediately followed by ""Wish You Were Here"" would sound the best, but what comes after WYWH makes little difference in the grand scheme of things. I think that ""Dogs"" would work well as Track 2, but there are few songs that could be a successful follow up to ""Breathe""'s ending - a lot of fuzzy editing work would be required to make that transition work. TGGITS > SOYCD1 would work really well without any transition, and you really can't separate Time from TGGITS (""Breathe (Reprise)"" is the transition between those two songs, and separating the songs without moving Breathe (Reprise) makes no sense). You also can't really separate ""Brain Damage"" from ""Eclipse"", and you can't put ""Eclipse"" anywhere but near the end. Putting ""High Hopes"" after ""Comfortably Numb"" instead of after ""Eclipse"" might work better, but I like the CN>BD transition a bit better than the HH>BD transition would be. And the transition from High Hopes to Echoes might be the most profound on the whole track."
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,will_wolfy,2,Mon Jun 15 18:30:43 2015 UTC,"SOYDC 2 would be the best follow up to WYWH, I think Have a Cigar matters less, honestly, if you find cleaner cuts."
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,Fcorange5,2,Mon Jun 15 18:49:09 2015 UTC,"ABITW2 includes THDOUL (no release of that song in all of history has ever NOT included THDOUL).   The single version started with the funk guitar then went right into ""We don't need no education"". No HDOUL.  Oh, and the High Hopes bell to Echoes ping is a great idea. Similar to what was done on Echoes: The Best Of Pink Floyd with the dialing tone."
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,will_wolfy,2,Mon Jun 15 21:59:38 2015 UTC,"Well I have to admit I'm a little disappointed that there is no representation from the Syd Era or the Post-Wall Era minus High Hopes (that includes The Final Cut), but these are all great tracks and I'll still be happy mixing whatever the final tracklist ends up being voted on.  Here's how I'd do the tracklist, but I don't think it's perfect:  Side 1:  Speak To Me/Breathe  Wish You Were Here (ends with the sound of wind)  One of These Days (starts with the sound of wind)  Happiest Days of Our Lives / Another Brick in The Wall (Part 2) (starts with the sound of a Helicopter)  Welcome To The Machine  Time  Sheep  Money  Pigs (Three Different Ones)  Comfortably Numb  Side 2:  Atom Heart Mother  Have a Cigar  Hey You  Dogs  Brain Damage (V these songs shouldn't be separated)  Eclipse (^ these songs shouldn't be separated)  Side 3:  Shine On You Crazy Diamond I-V  Us and Them  High Hopes  Wot's... Uh The Deal  Mother  The Great Gig in The Sky  Run Like Hell  Shine On You Crazy Diamond VI - IX  Echoes"
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,stricktotheland,-1,Mon Jun 15 22:14:56 2015 UTC,"I don't see why you wouldn't separate tracks, imo Speak to Me and Breathe could be separated into tracks along with Brain Damage and Eclipse."
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,will_wolfy,2,Mon Jun 15 21:10:37 2015 UTC,No Another Brick in the Wall Part 3 or Lost For Words?! What!
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,Megalandrys,3,Mon Jun 15 21:15:36 2015 UTC,Believe it or not neither of those got many votes at all  ABITW Part 3 got 8 and Lost for Words got 5.

pinkfloyd,39x3kb,youvegottabecrazy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:56:37 2015 UTC,The mixer can take liberties with tracks to aid in transitions by including snippets from other songs (or in this case whole tracks that act more as interludes) if they wish to.  I think /u/PinkFloydJoe wishes to.
pinkfloyd,39x3kb,will_wolfy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:41:30 2015 UTC,"I would like to present my track listing idea. These tracks are purely run by transitional ability, which means they will sound natural during transition from one track to the next. I have left the tracks as is, which means that Breathe is without Speak to Me, ABITW2 is without THDOOL, and so on and so forth. The tracks will only need slight editing for transitions, so I think this could work.

pinkfloyd,3a1vh9,will_wolfy,17,Tue Jun 16 16:07:16 2015 UTC,"It's bold, it's brash, it's mspaint chic. The best thing in music is Pink Floyd's compilation album ""Title Here"".   I love the use of symbolism - the way that the pig looks into the mystic prism is reminiscent of the pain and the anguish of Syd Barret's declining mental condition. The way the album covers give a visual history of the key albums, all without being too 'in your face' is just a work of creative genius.   No but seriously this is making my eyes bleed its so bad. I hope to high heaven you're not serious, and if you are, may God have mercy on your soul."

pinkfloyd,39xu73,PinkFloydBot,8,Mon Jun 15 18:00:23 2015 UTC,Killer Blues/Hard rock tune.
pinkfloyd,39xu73,Endxsor,7,Mon Jun 15 18:12:00 2015 UTC,Probably the most misunderstood song on The Wall. It's painfully ironic that this song became a big hit (relatively speaking).
pinkfloyd,39xu73,MaxCHEATER64,2,Mon Jun 15 19:16:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, nobody seems to get that it is a parody of rock/hard rock music."

pinkfloyd,39xu73,GroovingPict,3,Mon Jun 15 22:20:06 2015 UTC,"David plays the bass on this.  There exists some mispressings of the Italian Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2) / One of My Turns single which, instead of One of My Turns, contains an alternate version of Young Lust on the B-side (I cannot really imagine the circumstances that lead to this... not only is it the wrong song, but it's an alternate version of it... I mean, it's a stretch even if it had been a UK pressing, but for an Italian pressing? What were they even doing with that alternate version in the first place?)"
pinkfloyd,39xu73,maakuz,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:18:01 2015 UTC,Do you have a link to that version?
pinkfloyd,39xu73,GroovingPict,2,Mon Jun 15 19:39:44 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTti8RkoFEo  The difference is mainly in the extended intro I believe

pinkfloyd,39wsx3,mycoxxafloppin,7,Mon Jun 15 13:12:01 2015 UTC,"It doesnt seem promising when an article starts out with errors (even if slight). The balls on the pig wasnt a ""commentary on how Gilmour felt towards Waters"", it was because in their legal agreement, Roger retained the rights to the pig, but because of how it was worded, Roger only owned the rights to a female pig, so by slapping a pair of huge balls on it, they got around that. Otherwise, they would have had to pay Roger for the use of the pig.  Small errors maybe, but it's annoying and discouraging so early on in the article and makes you not feel like going on reading it, knowing there will be more, perhaps graver, errors."
pinkfloyd,39wsx3,GroovingPict,2,Mon Jun 15 14:28:32 2015 UTC,DId it mention sow or something in the documents?  Honestly curious.

Fearless is such a departure from what many people consider Pink Floyd's ""signature"" sound. I think it's awesome that Roger Waters plays acoustic on this song."

Like most of the shows on that tour, it has early versions of ""Raving and Drooling"" and ""You Gotta Be Crazy,"" a full performance of DSOTM, and ends with a blistering version of ""Echoes"" (this one is my personal favorite version).   Footnote: it's recorded by Mike ""The Mic"" Millard, who is renowned for his exceptional catalog of Zep, the Stones, Floyd, and Yes tapings in the '70s. The sound quality of this recording in particular, however, is superb. In my opinion it's one of the best Floyd audience recordings in existence.

From his imdb on the wall page,  under trivia it says:    In his autobiography ""Is That It?"", Bob Geldof tells the story of how he was first told about the project by his agent while riding in a taxi, and how he didn't want to do it because he didn't like the music of Pink Floyd. Roger Waters knows this story, not because he read it in Geldof's book, but because the taxi driver was actually Roger Waters' brother.   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084503/trivia?item=tr0677719"

Her dad would not necessarily be a soldier but, I don't know, someone who would have been sent in another country. She spends her life in a small town school and is quickly spotted by some producer. She starts touring in an insane pace.   What follows doesn't have to be changed a lot, but this brings some new cast ideas. The thing is the actress has to sing The Wall as Pink, so this is challenging.   EDIT : Ok you guys are right. This would need a lot of small lyrics changes (""I am just a new girl"" ""mother gonna check all your boyfriends for you"", etc ). About Goodbye blue sky, I guess this song brings the topic of war in a undebatable manner. I'm gonna have to edit my script now.   But comon ! To all the 'this song won't work', I say have imagination ! The Wall is such a great piece, it could transfer in other contexts very well ! Waters himself has changed its message over the years.

pinkfloyd,39qy7a,GwenCS,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:32:16 2015 UTC,"I was gonna say something similar. Around '68, when Gilmour had a clean cut face with shorter, wavy hair, and towards the late '70s he had longer, straight hair, and the picture shows him with a shaved face (at least, mostly), but with straighter hair, and with the mostly shaved, yet slightly hairy, face, so I'd say it'd be around that time.

Had to be 72 at the latest, and judging by the look of the board I doubt it's DSotM, that doesn't look like Abbey Road's board, though I don't know where ObC was done, it might have been done at Abbey Road, in which case I would assume it might be during the mixing of Pompeii, unless they weren't present for that, in which case I'm lost."

While it may be that few Floyd fans have seen them play at this famous arena (this was their only performance there) many will have seen the Waters-less version of Pink Floyd playing in their own version of this stage. The stage used for Pink Floyd's 1994 World Tour was strongly reminiscent of the Hollywood Bowl.  Indeed, lighting designer Marc Brickman declared at that time that band had very fond memories of their show there in 1972 and got a nice feeling of the shape of that stage. So in the end they decided to ""take the Hollywood Bowl on tour"".    Pink Floyd played there in 1972"

Most of rock bands in that period would just stick to sex, drugs and rock and roll agenda, but Pink Floyd has more songs about existential stuff which tends to be more depressing, eye opening etc.  From my experience people who think about these topics and generally are not contend with the way this world works, are much more likely to engage in drugs, so maybe that's why its more popular in those circles than others."

pinkfloyd,39s7r6,Freddies_Mercury,17,Fri Jun 19 15:44:53 2015 UTC,"The band itself had a very unhappy beginning (what with its founding member going insane and everything), and was filled with unhappy people.  On one hand, you have Roger Waters, basically the poster child for 70s anti-establishmentism.  On the other, you have Richard Wright, who battled with depression and addictions throughout his life.  On the third hand, you have David Gilmour, one of the greatest guitar players of all time (and a damn good lyricist near the end of the band).     But there's another layer here that most people don't get.  Take The Final Cut for example. It's an album that is more or less about how society has degraded through peace as much as it did through war, and it ends by narrating a nuclear apocalypse. But TFC wasn't supposed to be depressing. It wasn't supposed to make you sad. It was supposed to make you enjoy being sad. To paraphrase a poster from this sub a few months ago, ""It doesn't get me out of a bad mood, but it does make me like being in a bad mood.""  PF's lyrics, from 1968 to 1994, were always very philosophical and almost always had a  message they wanted you to understand. Was Animals a screaming ball of rage towards the current sociopolitical situation in the western world? Yes. Was that all it was? Absolutely not! Animals didn't just want you to get mad, it wanted you to get aware of what was going on. And then there's POTW, a reminder that no matter how angry or sad you'll ever get, they'll always be someone else in your situation that could lean you a shoulder.  Starting in 1973 there really wasn't a single song of theirs (well...maybe a couple off of MLOR) that had a single meaning, and I guarantee you that none of them were specifically written to make you want to off yourself.           I also take personal offense to you generalizing Pink Floyd fans as drug addicts, or you treating suicide in such a lighthearted way, considering both of those were very counterintuitive to what Floyd is/was all about."

pinkfloyd,39s7r6,KIMrPickle,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:18:49 2015 UTC,Mason didn't do a lot of songwriting in the grand scheme of things.
pinkfloyd,39s7r6,MaxCHEATER64,6,Fri Jun 19 15:45:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe a lot of their song got that bluesy tone/lyrics, but for me the positive energy comes from this. I love blues, I love PF."
pinkfloyd,39s7r6,GristleCZ,4,Fri Jun 19 16:43:11 2015 UTC,"The thing that really fascinates me with Floyd, from the start and still does, is how they brandished their depression, madness and the despair of living. As they were dwelling with their demons they studied, nurtured and trained them."
pinkfloyd,39s7r6,OhTheHueManatee,4,Sun Jun 14 08:26:37 2015 UTC,"Man, this music makes me want to jump off a damn bridge. Don't worry though, it's in a good way!"

pinkfloyd,39s7r6,ragby,3,Sun Jun 14 09:31:52 2015 UTC,"It's funny...I don't think of their music as depressing.  It seems to deal with realistic views of the world and I want to live with reality.  So to me it seems philosophical and much higher-minded than a lot of other music.  Also, I'm not a drug addict."
pinkfloyd,39s7r6,Onedwa,2,Sun Jun 14 10:29:03 2015 UTC,"They had to witness their best friend go crazy, and eventually Roger had to let him go."
pinkfloyd,39s7r6,lymerence,2,Sun Jun 14 12:51:35 2015 UTC,"It's depressing in a beautiful way. Floyd was never about imagery, which is why most casual fans don't know what they look like. The album covers generally focused more on the tone of the album than the face of the band, just like how they disliked their rising fame, preferring to play to small groups of people who would actually listen to the music rather than go just to see the band and get blazed.  Arguably their most upbeat-sounding single, Free Four, had dissonantly hopeless lyrics. But many songs, even instrumentals, could be a very melancholic experience. I love the way they used so many minor chords (which, IMO, are the most beautiful chords, especially when their usage in a progression can make even major chords sound bittersweet. I think Fat Old Sun is the best example of this. A slow but optimistic chord sequence with happy imagery, until the chilling bridge comes in with its minor chords. But not only that - the lyrics themselves are very downbeat, at least when compared to the rest of the song, which I think makes it one of the Floyd's most beautiful moments.  I really like that bittersweet, downbeat sound. There's something so much more musically and emotionally drawing to it. Gilmour's more falsetto voice makes it all the more perfect. I'm really inspired by that sort of tone and sound when it comes to music, just showing it can be a very personal experience."
pinkfloyd,39s7r6,dan_t_mann,3,Sun Jun 14 10:37:30 2015 UTC,"All alone or in twos, the one who really love you, walk up and down, outside the wall. Some hand in hand, some gather together in bands, the bleeding hearts and artists make their stand. And when they've given your their all, some stagger and fall. After all it's not easy banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall."
pinkfloyd,39s7r6,mudo2000,4,Sun Jun 14 14:56:38 2015 UTC,"Said it before and I'll say it again:  You don't need drugs to enjoy Pink Floyd, but you need Pink Floyd to really enjoy your drugs.  Also: I'm not an addict; I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me.  e: apparently /r/pinkfloyd doesn't like Marilyn Manson and K's Choice."

pinkfloyd,39mjh2,AleciaQou,9,Fri Jun 12 20:08:03 2015 UTC,This just played on my music player. I love the solo on this song. I think David's first solo album is more underrated than Obscured By Clouds.
pinkfloyd,39mjh2,PinkFloydJoe,3,Fri Jun 12 21:00:49 2015 UTC,"I agree and all things considered that's saying what a rotten deal David got. I think, as has happened with other performance artists who want to test the waters alone, it was a way for the public to punish him for daring to step outside the Pink Floyd nest. I think, above all, the listening public was terrified of losing Pink Floyd if David Gilmour was a solo success. At any rate, David did not get the credit he deserved for that album."
pinkfloyd,39mjh2,PinkFloydJoe,6,Fri Jun 12 21:47:16 2015 UTC,David was really good at testing the Waters...  ba dum tshhh

pinkfloyd,39mjh2,Leftieswillrule,0,Fri Jun 12 21:52:39 2015 UTC,"Same thing happened with Wright. His first album, which was pretty good, was totally ignored. His second, which was absolutely fantastic and better than anything Gilmour had put out alone up until that point, was still ignored.  And then On an Island rolled around and it was pretty popular because there was an entire generation of Floyd fans who knew Gilmours name that didn't exist thirty years prior."

pinkfloyd,39mjh2,tanukis_parachute,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:03:56 2015 UTC,I always think of the first Gilmour solo album as part of Pink Floyd canon. It sounds far more evocative and Floydy than the last two or three proper PF albums. All it needed was a Hipgnosis album cover.
pinkfloyd,39mjh2,Heatinmyharbl,6,Sat Jun 13 06:33:06 2015 UTC,"""There's No Way Out of Here"" was released in 1978 and was the only single from David Gilmour's solo album, titled: David Gilmour"
pinkfloyd,39mjh2,Rooster_Ties,4,Fri Jun 12 20:14:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it is because it was the first solo album by a Floyd member that I bought...or that I am on Team Dave (guitar player since 1984) but this is my fave solo album by any of them.   from mihalis to i can't breathe anymore...there isn't a song i dislike. and several i love (mihalis, no way out of here, cry from the the street, short and sweet, raise my rent, no way). ok more than several."

Here 'tis...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDssNn8PvDU  Edit: I think I first heard Dave's first (S/T) solo album around 1987 (several months before AMLOR came out), but I'm not sure I picked up that it was a cover-tune until a good 8-10 years later."

Throughout my childhood my father would play Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin (among others) in the car, and for a long time I didn't really pay attention to it. The more I would hear it and the more I would recognize things, the more I started to enjoy it. I am 25 now and am a bigger Pink Floyd fan than my father. (Don't get me wrong, he still loves the band too. I've just listened to all kinds of boot legs, Gilmour/Waters' solo stuff, etc etc, that he hasn't ever listened to)  In the same way that my father listened to classic rock a lot around me, my mother listened to Prince a lot around me. I don't like Prince nearly as much as Zeppelin or Floyd, but I still like quite a few of his songs because I recognize it and 'grew up with it' in a sense. I like John Mellencamp for the same reason - except my grandpa was the one who played that a lot. If he likes the music, eventually he'll start to appreciate it on his own.  Good luck :)"

There's some high quality footage of Floyd circa 1972, on the DVD with the Dark Side Immersion set, but it doesn't include any Dark Side songs.  The next best thing is this pro-shot footage (from the same DVD) -- but that's it!   Careful With That Axe, Eugene (Live In Brighton, 1972)  7:43 Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun (Live In Brighton, 1972)  9:13   But there's basically NO pro-shot footage from 1972-1977, so everything is pre-72, or else from The Wall shows.  To be 100% accurate, the only exception is that there's about 2-3 minutes of single-camera (handheld, but a pretty big rig probably) pro-shot footage from about 1975, taken by a single cameraman in front of the stage (between the stage and the audience).  But other than that, I'm not aware of ANY pro-shot Floyd footage from '72-'77."

I fell asleep on a 50 mph road at 12:30 PM (yes, it was the middle of the day, truly a bizarre incident) and swerved directly into a MAC truck in the opposite lane (according to witness reports). Broke both legs, left arm and my jaw. No head or spinal injury. The last thing I remember from that day was making a left off my friend's street, about 10 minutes before the accident occurred and I was in a drug induced coma for 3 days. I remember nothing else about it (the brain does a great job of making you forget things you do not want to know about). I was apparently awake the entire time the EMTs were cutting me out of the car, etc, and I gave them both of my parents cell phone numbers (was 21 at the time). Was taken to the nearest heli-pad and choppered to Cooper Trauma Center in NJ. My memory started up again in the hospital about a week after the initial accident.  I was hospitalized for 2.5 weeks initially and had 3 separate surgeries (that I remember). Two to clean the wounds out, one to fix my left femur and right tibia. I was a very scared and nervous 21 year old in tons of pain. During the day I had my family of course, and my mom has been a nurse for over 25 years, so that certainly helped too. But at night after visiting hours were over I had nobody but the nurses. The only things I had were my phone and a book. The only music I had on my phone at the time was 'A Momentary Lapse of Reason'. It was a brand new phone and I hadn't had the chance to put anything else on it yet.  I listened to that album every single night during that first hospital stay while falling asleep. It kept me sane and helped me so much to get through that. I can't even begin to tell you how much David Gilmour really means to me. I do not believe in God, I am an atheist. But the universe clearly wanted me to have a special connection to this music because the first song, 'Signs of Life', is 4:23 long and my birthday is 4/23 too! Now 8 surgeries and 4 years later and I am fully recovered - just a whole lot of scars on my legs ;) Currently trying to get a medical coding and billing position.  I cannot wait for David to tour NA in 2016 so I can see him in person. ...sorry the book of a response, but it seemed like a story that someone like you would appreciate :)"
pinkfloyd,39fh2g,onionpants,0,Fri Jun 12 06:54:27 2015 UTC,"First of all, no apologies about the length of this response or any further replies that you may send. As, you'll soon find out, I am the queen of long posts. The only reason my comments have been short is because they accompany music posts. Here's the thing, so many people try to condense the stories that they have to tell, or the comments that they want to make because their listener can't be bothered enough to read anything over three sentences long. I know that's an exaggeration, but not by much. I find that to be appalling. A story takes time to develop, some more than others and if the person that I'm communicating with cannot be bothered to take the time to read what I have taken the time to type (I HATE typing) that tells me that my thoughts are of no significance to them. And, that's just fine. I simply stop investing my time and effort and they miss out on some pretty cool conversations. The only reason my comments in here have been short is because I'm commenting on music post that I'm making and not responding to a reply.  When I recently saw tl;dr at the bottom of a comment, I didn't know what it meant so I, of course, googled it and when I found out what it stands for I thought to myself: ""What bullshit is this? I am expected to write one or two sentences as a summary of my post for some lazy ass who couldn't be bothered to find out what I had to say? I don't think so, and fuck you anyway."" I hate twitter and don't ""tweet"" because of that ridiculous character limit they impose.   Before I continue, I need to make sure that I address the subject of ""potty mouth."" I love a well timed and well placed piece of profanity. But,I will refrain pulling from the profanity pond, if  swearing is something you find offensive. But, by way of explanation let me put it to you  this way: I hold a BA in English. I studied effective communication for four years and if I have to, I can discuss anything, with anyone. I'm not saying that I know anything about the subject at hand, but I can effectively express to the speaker that I am clueless about their subject. So, my point is, I have demonstrated that I can speak well, so I've earned the right to be a gutter mouth when it's called for. If gutter mouth was all I could speak, then I would be just another vulgar person. Does that make sense to you? I hope it does. So, you let me know if ""colorful language"" disturbs you.   I am a firm believer in ""connections"" and in the power the universe. I am a spiritual person but I am not a religious one. My respect for your intelligence was increased immensely when I read that you are an atheist. I am still putting it all together but god does not factor into the equation, unless his name is David Gilmour. I know that is so beyond corny, (I am also the queen of corn ball) but, I never cease to be completely enthralled by his musical brilliance and I never cease to be amazed at how unassuming he is about it. There is a video of ""Run Like Hell"" that I love to watch because as the song opens there are shots of Gilmour on the guitar as he plays those teaser chords...Then the lights come up a bit and you can see that young guy/replacement bass player standing next to him and just before the song really begins Gilmour smiles at him and it's a really cool smile. It's so touching to see that David Gilmour does not look down from some  musical genius throne even though he could easily do so. He connects with that much younger musician and  I smile every time I see it.    Was the time you spent in the hospital listening to Momentary Lapse of Reason your introduction to Pink Floyd/David Gilmour or are you a veteran listener? And are you just getting over a ""crush"" as I believe you put it? I ask so that I will know if there are certain albums of theirs that you may not be familiar with so I would not reference them in a conversation.  I can not even imagine breaking both of my legs, an arm and my jaw. That must have been such a harrowing ordeal. I'm so glad that you made it through it all relatively intact. The plus side is that you connected to such an awesome musician because of it.   I am a Pink Floyd expert: AMA...I'm just kidding. But, I am really interested in how deeply involved you are with Pink Floyd and their music. Are you familiar with this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ewq73ADlEg  No MOM JEANS going on in those days. I love all their music so it's pointless for me to say: ""I love this song"" just assume it goes with any post of theirs that I ever make."
pinkfloyd,39hysn,bolanrox,4,Thu Jun 11 21:03:03 2015 UTC,"Are you referring to this tone?  If so, then it is indeed the MXR Phase 90 into a Binson Echorec, with a Send/Return for the delay volume.   It's basically the same tone he uses on Have a Cigar.  He also might be using a little bit of Fuzz to push his amp into Overdrive.   Roger didn't have a huge pedalboard, only a Fuzz Face, Phase 90, Binson Echorec, and a Envelope Filter (""auto-wah"") which he used rarely called the EHX Bass Balls.  EDIT: Also Roger played the bass on Raving and Drooling live, but he didn't play the bass on Sheep live.  Proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFgjOjcAK40"

pinkfloyd,39bp0s,PinkFloydBot,14,Wed Jun 10 18:00:13 2015 UTC,"One of my favourite Floyd songs, hands down. Easily in the top 5.  When I first listened to it a long, long time ago, I misinterpreted it as a love song. Perhaps it was the sudden decrease in tempo, with the slow guitar, piano, and saxophone solos creating a jazzy vibe to it.   And who knows which is which and who is who  Up and Down  And in the end it's only round and round and round  Haven't you heard it's a battle of words   Lyrics such as these made me think it was about how arguing in relationships was pointless - it's all words, and in the end none of it really matters when you focus on what's really important.   Down and Out  It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about  With, without  And who'll deny that's what the fightings all about  Get out of the way, it's a busy day  And I've got things on my mind   Along the same lines as above; people have arguments, and words are thrown around. But, in the end, we all just have to get on with what is really important for ourselves and each other.  The song is actually about war, the sides that fight in it, and the fact that in the end we're all the same. It's strange how you can interpret something so far off without reading the lyrics or mishearing the singing. I used to think that the entire The Final Cut album was about love before I read about it in detail.  All in all, a lovely song that I feel serves as a nice break in the middle of The Dark Side of the Moon. It slows everything down for the listener for a few minutes, before getting back to the themes of insanity and madness. Really stands out from the album and even by itself."
pinkfloyd,39bp0s,Flamov,6,Wed Jun 10 18:20:45 2015 UTC,"about how arguing in relationships was pointless   Just today I was listening to Lost For Words, and I think that's the point of this song too. Maybe I'm wrong but I think it's funny how the theme has showed up more than once."

pinkfloyd,39cije,Malckeor,11,Wed Jun 10 21:04:53 2015 UTC,"There's tons of bootlegs though, and some are in very good quality - just a professional sound engineer's light touch away from being as good as any officially released live album (though the people on internet forums do an amazing job compiling and mixing these bootlegs).   If you're interested I can set up a dropbox real quick and upload some 70s era boots for you. I'm picky about sound quality, so most of them are soundboard recordings and are highly listenable. I've got a select few from the Atom Heart Mother era, some Dark Side of the Moon performances (one of them being an early, live version, performed before the studio album was released, another is the full '74 London version you were looking for), several Wish You Were Here performances, and two Animals Era ones (The best ones, in my opinion).  I've nowhere near the extensive collection some users on this sub have, but I've cultivated what I feel are the best from each era. You should also give the early performances a listen - There's a performance of their ""Man and the Journey"" which is perhaps the best sounding bootleg that I own (owing to the small venue). This was before their golden years, but is just as good as anything they produced later on."

I first got into music and PF right when CDs were becoming widespread in the mid to late 1980s, so my PF collection had CDs from that era through the ~1994 remasters.  What I like about the 2011 remasters is the consistency across all of the albums.  I actually posted an analysis of Pigs (3DO) from a 1990 CD, the Oh By the Way version, and the Discovery (2011) version. http://www.reddit.com/r/pinkfloyd/comments/2vt4ox/comparison_of_3_different_cd_releases_of_pigs3do/"

pinkfloyd,397uj7,hannibellecter,5,Tue Jun 9 22:09:19 2015 UTC,"People don't seem to appreciate the mellow bits of wankery that come before epics in prog rock albums. It's not a new thing at all. ""Moonchild"" from King Crimson's In the Court of the Crimson King album frequently gets shit for being a 2 minute ballad followed by 10 minutes of jamming but it's such an unbelievably perfect setup to the symphonic monolith that is the title track.  Seamus serves the exact same purpose leading up to Echoes."

pinkfloyd,397uj7,OhTheHueManatee,12,Tue Jun 9 22:38:40 2015 UTC,"I wish it were longer; the ""I don't need no arms around me"" and the loud, harsh, and fast ""All in all it was all just bricks in the wall. All in all you were all just bricks in the wall"" get me every time. I wouldn't say I like it more than part 2, but both are the same in high places in my mind. If it were a bit longer I would love it so much more than 2."
pinkfloyd,397uj7,Megalandrys,7,Tue Jun 9 23:02:36 2015 UTC,"IMHO it does a great job of conveying the ""rationalizations"" that come from depression. Even though it has a few lyrics they're sung amazingly well and just like the other Brick songs it uses the surrounding songs to build on it. Part 2 feels closer to bitching and moaning rather than a powerful feeling everyone can relate too."

For example, when you think about it, the lyrics to songs like Yet Another Movie, On The Turning Away, Great Day for Freedom, etc. are great, imo. Sometikes I even think AMLOR's lyrics are slightly better than the lyrics on TFC, imo."
pinkfloyd,397uj7,wbsmbg,4,Wed Jun 10 00:57:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with all but Louder Than Words. I get that it's meant to be a reflection of their experience and synergy as a band, but it just doesn't sound like Floyd to me."

pinkfloyd,397uj7,gm4,10,Wed Jun 10 11:35:18 2015 UTC,"Dark Side of the Moon is not psychedelic, it's symphonic, and there are hardly any hidden meanings in any of the stuff, its mostly straightforward damn near political commentary. It's intellectual not psychedelic or hippy."
pinkfloyd,397uj7,bolanrox,4,Wed Jun 10 03:13:38 2015 UTC,Agreed -Floyd was never a Hippy band.  Would be like lumping Zappa into that category.
pinkfloyd,397uj7,hannibellecter,5,Wed Jun 10 14:36:03 2015 UTC,"No downvotes or anything but DSOTM is not ""damn near political commentary"", that would be ""The Final Cut"" you're thinking of.  DSOTM is a humanistic album(even the song titles give this away) (like the majority of the core Floyd records) discussing themes of different aspects of life from birth to death with a very few political items thrown in for good measure since we have to deal with politics (sadly).  You should re-read the lyrics or read some longer discussions about this subject online cause you're really missing out on some great lyrics, themes and thoughts on the human condition and what we go through as a collective if you got a political album out of them.  It'll be like listening to DSOTM for the first time all over again... I envy you =)"

I mean, that's not to take away from any of the man's great talents, and I absolutely love his lyrics and his bass playing and him as a musician. But, as a person... he just seems like a total jerk all around, not allowing the band to use the name ""Pink Floyd"", and being so bossy on the Waters albums (although this might have been for the best and probably contributed to their genius).

I liked it more 25 years ago (when I was in college), but I've grown to like it less and less every year.  Don't get me wrong, objectively it's a great album, and an even better theater piece -- but it does next to nothing for me these days, and I'm content to hear it about once a year (if that). And The Final Cut doesn't do much for me either.  That said, Roger deserves an enormous amount of credit for creating one of the most iconic albums of the last 50 years."

pinkfloyd,397uj7,MaxCHEATER64,7,Wed Jun 10 23:30:09 2015 UTC,"""When You're In"" is better than ""Obscured by Clouds"", but the latter has a better title.  The Final Cut is better than any of Waters's solo work (not by much though).  The Endless River was mediocre at best, and far too long in comparison to how much it actually accomplished.  The Division Bell is better than any album pre-Dark Side.  Wish You Were Here is the worst of the 'core four'.  ""Have a Cigar"" would've been better as a duet if they had gotten the timing right.  Obscured by Clouds is a great album, but filled with filler and not nearly as good as anything that came after it (save MLOR).  Ummagumma's album art was neat, but not particularly good in comparison to some of the other ones.   The Division Bell's album art is the second best of any Floyd album, being bested only by The Wall."

I listen to loads of blues and folk too (including Chinese folk music which sounds so different to western music). I'm interested in throat singing too, such an alien sound for a human to produce.

Not much so, but like I said, it just feels very unnecessary and half-finished. It feels like they had some solid ideas to work with, but then they just lead to nothing. It all feels like a very long intro to the final song on the album. The Division Bell ends with High Hopes, a great song. It was a great end to Pink Floyd. There was no reason to continue on after that.  I get people hating AMLOR, that's totally understandable. But at least it was a complet album and they went for something different, even if it is super duper 80s sounding. It didn't feel like the leftovers of the last album like TEL does."

pinkfloyd,397uj7,OfAnthony,6,Wed Jun 10 12:29:51 2015 UTC,IMO SOYCD is more exploitation of Syd Barrett than a tribute. (IMO)
pinkfloyd,397uj7,Megalandrys,3,Wed Jun 10 13:23:31 2015 UTC,Why do you say that?
pinkfloyd,397uj7,OfAnthony,4,Wed Jun 10 18:59:56 2015 UTC,"Syd Barrett was sick. Reclusive. Asperger's, schizophrenia, depression. Drug abuse. I'm speculating on the diagnosis. I'm going on what I've heard Wright say in an interview; Whether or not Barrett's decline came to be because of drug abuse or if he was already suffering from these symptoms prior to the intake of hallucinogens and narcotics. Alcohol can do this to an individual as well. It's unclear what specifically happened to Barrett. What is clear is how the remaining members of Floyd treated this dilemma of a lost friend. A friend who was very sick. A friend they left behind; I think they regret that.   Maybe its better if I state my opinion in the form of a question. What would you know about Syd Barret without SOYCD?  I was born in 1983, I didn't get in to Floyd until 1995-96. Everything I have ever learned about the band is in perspective. You could say the same about many things; one day you might think differently about something you hold dear, and later come to resent those past feelings. It's human.   Having said that I've known a couple Syd Barrett's in my life. I'm sure many people reading can relate. What I did just there is form of exploitation too. Using the name Syd Barrett to represent a term, someone who has gone mad. That's unfair, but understandable considering the details, story's, and legends. I guess I'm trying to state that I respect SOYCD for what it is, but it leaves me with a sour feeling considering the subject. You may hate lions, but when one is in your path you must respect it and give it the right of way. That's one way I can express my feelings on the track at the moment. It's not my words, not my music. It's not my friend who is the subject; I respect it for what it is. I don't like seeing the helpless exploited for any reason. That's how I feel at the moment...  All the attention this track brought back to Barrett, I don't think he wanted that or deserved it. I couldn't do this to my friends or family, I'd feel so much regret in taking a penny knowing the desperate situation this might cause. I'd feel similar remorse if I exposed someone I know who is sick, for the benefit of artistic expression, money, whatever."

pinkfloyd,397uj7,Megalandrys,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:19:53 2015 UTC,"I've known a couple of Syd Barrett's, I've been compared to him myself. Not in a mad way, but then again, I wouldn't rule that out. In school? Actually, still? This was me. I've done research on Syd Barrett, I've written papers on him. I love him. I knew a lot about him before I knew what Wish You Were Here (song and album) was.  Anyway, I don't know why you suppose he has had (ouch) asperger's and depression, he seemed to be quite the opposite actually (if you want to call him clinically depressed prior to drug abuse, assuming he was that depressed then, you'll have to call most of the human race clinically depressed), drugs just messed him up. Schizophrenic... well, he acted as such, but considering his sister denied it and, besides, said actions could also be assigned to his drug abuse, and the rule of ruling out other ways of receiving schizophrenic symptoms is one of the ways physicians and such know for sure you do have schizophrenia.   I agree though, I doubt he wanted the attention it brought him, but it was a nice tribute none-of-the-less, and you still might respect it and ""Wish You Were Here"" from an artistic, musical view, but from Syd's side, I doubt he wanted a tribute and the attention it brought."

pinkfloyd,397uj7,chernyakdavid,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:53:16 2015 UTC,"The instrumental part of The Endless River makes a pretty decent album, but Louder Than Words just ruins the entire album for me, IMO It just sounds cheesy and uninspired, especially the first line, ""We bitch and we fight, diss each other on sight."" ...It sounds more like a hip-hop lyric than a Floyd lyric. It just really upsets me that my favorite band's discography has to end with what sounds like a hastily done whimper instead of a bang."

The ""best"" way to use spotify would probably to make a playlist and organize it it the particular order you'd like. Unfortunately if you don't have premium it will shuffle everything and make life miserable. What's worse is they throw in ads that sometimes will startle the shit outta ya. Best way to enjoy Pink Floyd is to buy the album outright and use a player of your choice. Well, I hope this opinion was help full."

I can understand someone putting the song on as a novelty to show someone. But i can't understand with their extensive catalogue of impressive songs someone saying ""you know here's a great pink Floyd song that is representative of their sound and talent."" It's uninspired writing with mediocre delivery. It shows why they were smart to lose Barret and hire gilmore. If they continued on that road we never would have gotten anything close to their best works. So pardon me if I'd rather not listen to a song that people elevate to greatness simply for existing. There are a wealth of amazing Floyd songs and this is not one of them."

I used a Big Muff with a Boss Blues Driver pedal for fuzz, a rotary simulator to give it that swirling Dark Side of the Moon vibe (the one I have is the BBE Soul Vibe), and analog delay all run through a Twin Reverb.

Incidentally I just read The Black Strat by Phil Taylor (Gilmour's guitar tech for 30+ years). Basically gives a complete history of Gilmour's number one guitar from 1970 to now. I highly recommend it!

pinkfloyd,3977cl,DrRaulDuke,0,Sat Jun 20 14:29:59 2015 UTC,a Tele with hotter pickups is not all that different than an LP (even more so if it is coil tapped)    Plus David did have a PAF (gibson's LP humbucker) installed..
pinkfloyd,3977cl,bolanrox,2,Wed Jun 10 01:48:11 2015 UTC,"I think we're saying the same thing about the pickup. That said, tone is more than magnets, it's more than wood density/body weight, it's more that feel... It's kind of all those combined. And a Strat, a 57' reissue to be exact, is nothing if not a step in the right direction. An LP from 00's (?) is not..."

pinkfloyd,3991rk,Megalandrys,4,Wed Jun 10 03:19:18 2015 UTC,"Well, it is one of the first slide guitar parts, however I'm pretty sure on this track he is still just using a strat. Shine On introduced him to a real lap steel guitar, hence why the tone is clearer and he has more control. However, that part of Atom Heart is a lot busier in terms of chord changes which he had to be aware of, especially since his guitar was probably in standard tuning. Lap steels are usually open tuning in a certain chord and therefore more expressive. I don't know if I added anything useful but those are my knee-jerk thoughts."

pinkfloyd,394pph,DuceGiharm,2,Tue Jun 9 22:12:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, with a mix of their own songs."
pinkfloyd,394pph,DuceGiharm,3,Tue Jun 9 22:15:13 2015 UTC,"Last time he toured, he performed Echoes. The mere prospect of that happening again is reason enough for me to want to see him."
pinkfloyd,394pph,PharOutMan,3,Tue Jun 9 22:16:49 2015 UTC,And it was freakin' amazing.  But...I think David has said he won't play Echoes any more now that Rick is gone.  Does anyone else remember reading this?
pinkfloyd,394pph,ragby,2,Wed Jun 10 00:59:50 2015 UTC,It would make sense. He and Rick are that song.
pinkfloyd,394pph,GamerTyke,2,Wed Jun 10 10:17:15 2015 UTC,"He said, I think in a Jools Holland interview, though I may be wrong, that "" sadly Echoes is another song I won't be able to play again now that he's gone.""  Grasping the bigger picture, you can add Time, Breathe, Breathe reprise, Us and Them, probably SOYCD to that list as well."
pinkfloyd,394pph,grelch,2,Wed Jun 10 12:28:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think SOYCD is out of the question. David has done SOYCD without him in the past, although the only performance I can think of was the acoustic set."
pinkfloyd,394pph,Raisedkaine,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:41:00 2015 UTC,"You might well be right. It'll be a tougher call for David if he does a version with full band. As great a player as JC is and as well as he can mimic Rick's sound, that first keyboard solo is going to be hard to listen to without Rick manning the keys.  Tbh, I wouldn't be too bothered if David only played his solo stuff and  some covers like he did at Wyatt's Meltdown."

They put it on in the background while they browse the internet or do other things. Music like Floyd is meant to be enjoyed by letting yourself become enveloped by the music, and becoming one with it."
pinkfloyd,3954uc,GamerTyke,3,Tue Jun 9 16:47:17 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's what I've thought about a lot these times. It's not necessarily good or bad, it's just that it doesn't seem Pink Floyd and classic rock in general was made for it, and it seems like a waste. I mean, not every time. Sometimes I'll background Floyd while playing on PC or something, but I also pay a lot of attention to it most of the time, even airdrumming (I'm a drummer) and singing along to the dismay of everyone around me on the street when I'm walking. :3"

I'm happy to have friends who have the same tastes as me and we can hang out and listen to PF, but e.g. my room mate with whom I live for   almost a year gets irritated every time when Echoes are playing in my headphones. So, I think PF's should be entirely ones's personal choice, it's  wrong to try to make other people listen to them. Only if one has discovered this music by himself he can realize all its beauty and intensity."
pinkfloyd,3954uc,eayunts,5,Tue Jun 9 11:15:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah haha, I've always tried to introduce people to the band so they could feel the same way I do about them, but I've never tried to force it. All opinion of course! I wish i had some friends who had the same taste as me though."
pinkfloyd,3954uc,eayunts,3,Tue Jun 9 13:01:19 2015 UTC,"I succeeded in changing my ex-gf's mind on PF. She didn't understand that music at all but now due to  my efforts she admits that PF's lyrics are very profound and  philosophical. So, sometimes forcing people to listen some good stuff can be relatively  successful, hah. But of course if I want smb to get acquainted with PF, I do it softly and nicely."

pinkfloyd,3954uc,Megalandrys,3,Tue Jun 9 19:57:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, me too. Just sounds completely different from the Waters-era stuff, which just clicks more with me. But I'll give it a listen sometime quiet. Sometime."
pinkfloyd,3954uc,Megalandrys,5,Tue Jun 9 22:59:06 2015 UTC,"If you can't find a good quality Piper anywhere, and this goes for you too, jayson, I'll send you my mp3 where it's all together, no track breaks besides the ones that came with the record. Personally, if you like Waters-era stuff, or ""Echoes"", you might try out ""Astronomy Domine"", and if you're into the psychedelic instrumentals of the '60s, a bit like ""Echoes"", try out ""Interstellar Overdrive"", but make sure you listen with headphones/earbuds (or at least have surround sound speakers on either side of you). It's not the same without them. Assuming you can find one where they haven't remastered it without it (I've seen it before). Deep lyrics and good instrumentals... the first hint of that would be in ""Matilda Mother"". Or later, on A Saucerful of Secrets, he wrote and sang ""Jugband Blues"", which reminds me a bit of ""A Day in the Life"" at parts, but as it Roger wrote the lyrics. Like, The Final Cut deep, but not always about war and shit.   People say they don't like ""Chapter 24"", but it has some deep lyrics, if you consider it's basically quoting The I-Ching. I haven't heard a lot of his solo stuff, but I have what I think is a bootleg called Syd Barrett - Scarecrow (well, the ""Scarecrow"" part is beneath the ""Syd Barrett"" part, and it's on plain cardboard stuff, plain white sleeve, regular black vinyl, no record label or anything, the label just says ""Syd Barrett"" and the songs.). It has some unreleased recordings, most notably ""Scream Thy Last Scream"" and ""Lucy Leave"". If you like the Beatles or anything Syd's written, most likely your going to like those songs too.  Just trying to help introduce some fellow Pink Floyd fans to the Barrett, don't mind me."

I don't have the time or patience to sit through it myself, (sorry) but if you do, I'm sure you'll be able to hear screams of panic or drug induced hysteria brought on by the sight of a giant burning pig. If you don't hear any of that, it's likely it never happened - there were no other concerts in Milwaukee in '77. Also, you might see if they had the pig in on subsequent concert dates, because if they did, it means the pig never destroyed (either that or they kept a whole farm of inflatable pigs on their tour bus, which is unlikely).  Interestingly, there's a wikipedia on their inflatable pigs. It mentions several incidents where the pig flew away during roger waters solo years, but never any mention of such an occurrence during the In The Flesh tour (no mention of it bursting or burning up either)."

This track has a host of musicians on it: Joe Chemay, Stan Farber, Jim Haas, Bruce Johnston, John Joyce, and Toni Tenille provide backing vocals; David Gilmour and James Guthrie on the ARP quadra sequencer (Gilmour also plays guitar, naturally); Bob Ezrin on the Prophet-5 synth; Freddie Mandell on organ; Nick Mason on drums; and Roger Waters on bass guitar, VCS3, and lead vocals (you'll notice a lack of Rick Wright there, Mandell instead taking the role as keyboardist... in the concerts, Rick would play the Hammond and also the Prophet-5 on this track).  It was re-recorded for the movie, with Geldof on vocals, and also rearranged for brass and choir. There is no guitar or drums in the movie version.  During the scene in the movie, the audience of skinheads are comprised of actual skinheads, with some 400 people from Tilbury Skins."

We also know there's a song based on a painting David and Polly own.  Edit: If this album goes to number one in the UK (which it might), Polly's first four albums will all have gone to number one. Has that happened to any writer since Lennon/McCartney?"

pinkfloyd,38uii7,InMyBrokenChair,11,Sun Jun 7 10:46:34 2015 UTC,Here's an idea... How about nobody bashes anyone? Both people have good points and both have bad points. Not everything is black and white.
pinkfloyd,38uii7,gl77,2,Sun Jun 7 15:15:46 2015 UTC,I completely agree. We can all enjoy the music all of them made and make. I was just stirring the pot.
pinkfloyd,38uii7,gl77,7,Sun Jun 7 15:38:57 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing Gilmour can get bashed for is complimenting his wife. What a heinous crime. And, like, two people even cared in this comment section.  Meanwhile, we've got another guy who made a big deal about how his former band disgraced The Wall by performing certain songs from it in arenas. And made fun of U2 for charging 45 pounds for arena concerts. Then, 15 years later, goes on a massive arena tour of The Wall, with the cheapest tickets coming in around 150 pounds.  Meanwhile, we've got another guy who threatened to sue Andrew Lloyd Webber for using a piece of the chromatic scale.  Meanwhile, we've got another guy who made fun of Bob Ezrin's lack of royalties during the making of The Wall (he made buttons that said ""NOPE: No Points Ezrin""), despite Ezrin co-writing a song on the album and being largely responsible for its sound. Then he got mad when Ezrin didn't want to work with him again.  Meanwhile, we've got a guy who sued his former band for wanting continue on when he voluntarily left. Remember, this is the same band that carried on when their original leader was kicked out.  Meanwhile, we've got a guy who invited all of his former bandmates' ex-wives to his Berlin performance of The Wall.  Meanwhile, we've got a guy who is somehow relevant despite not making an album in 23 years.  Meanwhile, we've got a guy whose next album has been ""coming along nicely"" since 1994.  Meanwhile, we've got a guy who thinks he can tell The Rolling Stones where they can and can't play.  Waters gets less crap than he deserves.  Edit: Freaking Poe's Law, man. I'm naïve."

Even though I am more of a Waters fan, they both have made great pieces of music over the years both together in a band and through their solo works. Roger is and will always be rather an outright dick and Gilmour can be a dick also, but he's more subtle about it. The music lives on and is what we're all here for in the end."

But I would bet a lot of money right now that Gilmour (whom I love) is/has been the one blocking a full Floyd reunion (even before Rick RIP).  Roger, I think, has grown-up and realized he was/can still be an asshole and their collective best is produced when they are together but Gilmour was so slighted and hurt that I think he is just an unmovable object at this point."
pinkfloyd,38uii7,hannibellecter,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:57:45 2015 UTC,"I think you're right. Waters has stated many times in recent years that he would love a PF reunion with Gilmour. And even Nick has stated so. How long it would last before Dave and Roger were at each other's throats is anyone's guess, but eventually I think it would happen, and so does David, which is why he doesn't even see it as an option at this point. He tried it out at Live 8 at the begging and pleading of Bob Geldof, and because it was for a good cause, but apparently it wasn't his cup of tea anymore."

I couldn't have been prouder of the citizens of Philadelphia that day. The winning album would be played in its entirety. The Wall ended up winning, which I think was a concentrated effort by everyone to just get The Wall played straight through on a radio station. It was fucking awesome.

TBH I don't really like his music but I appreciate his influence in what was to become Pink Floyd style.  My theory about WYWH sessions is that maybe someone from production staff saw that the band members are not very happy with each other anymore and thought that this might put them back into  same boat.

Even ""Echoes"", which doesn't have discreet 'parts' (like AHM or SOYCD does), was split into sections for Pompeii.  I've always liked the idea of having a PF 'best of' be songs interwoven with sections of ""Echoes"", similar to how Pompeii was staged.

pinkfloyd,38p4c7,arcainzor,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:51:59 2015 UTC,"I want to repost what I said on the other post.  I would suggest that, in vinyl terms, it should be in this format: At least a double album as in two records, four sides, around 25 minutes max per side; I'd say about 16-17 minimum.  At most a quad album, as in four records, eight sides, same minutes per side.   To elaborate, that basically means the same thing in CD terms, assuming you may make physical copies, double album being two CDs, around 50 minutes per CD at max, usually, maybe an hour.  Quad album being 4 CDs, same length per disc.  In digital, it doesn't really matter the length, so long it's not gigantic.  Basically, this means, depending on the length of each song, it's plausible you could have a double album or sorts, in vinyl terms, but since ""Echoes"" and AHM and Shine On are almost definitely going on there, it's possible, but not totally plausible, only if the track number is lower. Which means, in vinyl terms, you're gonna have like 3-4 records (6 or 8 sides). Probably."

Show me a North American version of the cover that has it. Unless you photoshop it yourself, you wont find it.  Also, I should add, I know that that is the original (i.e. first issue) North American cover, because it doesnt have the ""Special Buy"" text printed on it, nor an EMI/Harvest logo in the bottom left corner, which all subsequent issues had. Instead, the first issue had that on a pink sticker placed either directly on the cover or on the shrink wrap.  Here is a list of all American Ummagumma issues, and here are the Canadian ones. No Gigi cover on any of them.  Similarly (and I mention this because I know there are many with this misconception as well), there are absolutely no European issues which doesnt have the Gigi cover present.

The British version has the album Gigi leaning against the wall immediately above the ""Pink Floyd"" letters.[5] At a talk given at Borders bookstore in Cambridge on 1 November 2008, as part of the ""City Wakes"" project, Storm Thorgerson explained that the album was introduced as a red herring to provoke debate, and that it has no intended meaning. On most copies of American and Canadian editions, the Gigi cover is airbrushed to a plain white sleeve, apparently because of copyright concerns; however, the earliest American copies do show the Gigi cover,[13] and it was restored for the American remastered CD edition. On the Australian edition, the Gigi cover is completely airbrushed, not even leaving a white square behind. The house used as the location for the front cover of the album is located in Great Shelford, near Cambridge.[14]  -Wikipedia"

Now, instead of the awesome live stuff being lost to the dreck studio waffling, you can warm up your tube amp to the noodly toss that is The Narrow Way and The Grand Vizier's Garden Party. Then you flip over and it gets a little more tolerable Sysyphus and Grantchester Meadows (best studio track, by a wide, wide margin). You cap that off with the spacy Species.  Now you move onto side two (heart of the sun and saucerful) this continues the spacey feeling that was given in Species - builds on it and brings you home ready for Astronomy and the fucking crowning jewel of UG - Axe."

pinkfloyd,38jq47,a3poify,3,Sun Jun 7 20:01:27 2015 UTC,"Story time:  Roger Waters once met up with REM backstage at one of their shows when they were relatively new. He had heard some of their music and really liked it and had ""his guy"" get him passes for one of their shows. According to Roger, the whole band was really nice and all, except Stipe who was quite standoffish and quiet. Then Stipe (I think as an encore, but I dont remember), went out on stage and sang an impromptu version of Dark Globe, acapella. Apparently as a ""fuck you"" to Roger (or as Roger himself put it (Im quoting from memory): ""it was as if to say 'yeah, Syd was alright, but you... you...'""). Then they later went and recorded a studio version (with instruments this time ;) )."
pinkfloyd,38jq47,GroovingPict,3,Thu Jun 4 21:18:06 2015 UTC,"Also, during the 80s, presumably around 88/Opel, Syd was offered a sizable contract by a label to record new material with ""sympathetic"" musicians.  Peter Buck and Mike Mills were suggested."
pinkfloyd,38jq47,JoelNoelSixers,2,Fri Jun 5 08:19:07 2015 UTC,Huh. Wonder what Stipe had against him.
pinkfloyd,38jq47,letbaconcry,4,Fri Jun 5 00:52:32 2015 UTC,"There was, and to some degree is, a feeling/opinion among Syd fanatics that the rest of the band (and for some reason Roger in particular) didnt treat Syd very well during and after his split from the band. Nevermind that David, Roger, and Rick all helped him out on his two solo albums, working as producers, and David and Roger did a lot of the mixing as well. In fact, this track that Stipe chose to sing as a little ""fuck you"" to Roger was indeed produced and mixed by Roger and David (the original, I mean).  This feeling was probably more prevalent in the 80s and 90s though, than it is today (cue Syd fans replying to this saying they still feel that way :P )."

One known live performance by Syd, on February 24, 1972 (by Stars, Syd's short-lived band), but not unlikely that it was performed on other Stars shows as well.  Title is from a passage in chapter 9 of Lord of the Rings."

I can understand why some would dislike it, it is kinda boring, his singing isn't top notch and the guitar is very simple. But to me, this is the song where he poured his heart out. The lyrics are sad and obviously about Pink Floyd, similarly to Jugband blues. His voice is vulnerable as if he is about to break down. IMO this is a criminally underrated song."

I am fairly certain they are more a fan of the Gilmour-headed stuff but they played plenty of the hits from dsotm/the wall/animals/wywh/etc.   I think my favorite song by them was Learning To Fly or soycd, their renditions of both were near perfect. There were times during the show that I really couldn't even tell it wasn't Gilmour up there.   (I was also at about an [8] or [9] from brownies so that could've had something to do with it)  All that said, I've seen The Pink Floyd Experience as well, and while they were good, Australian Pink Floyd blew them out of the fucking water."

Personally Roger, Syd, and ol' Dave look better like that; Syd looks cuter, Roger isn't facing us and sort of has an exasperated smile, and Dave has a smile rather than an open mouth."

pinkfloyd,38c1vk,RegularNameWasTaken,5,Wed Jun 3 07:23:53 2015 UTC,"Perhaps not as a complete piece, but there are plenty of great versions of single tracks from it. Money obviously stands out (or as Roger once itroduced it: ""we're gonna do one more song now, dedicated to the crew, and it's called 'I Wouldn't Know a Cue If it Fell on My Fucking Head'"", which I thought was pretty funny :p )"
pinkfloyd,38c1vk,GroovingPict,4,Wed Jun 3 16:08:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's because they were forced to use Union crew members who didn't know any of the proper cues, there are some bootlegs where the cash register sounds are way off from the band's playing."

pinkfloyd,38c1vk,DeepDingo,2,Wed Jun 3 08:04:19 2015 UTC,"I have.  It doesn't really capture the magic of the original album. I can't say I blame them though, they didn't have any extra musicians on board (apart from the backup singers) and couldn't recreate all the sounds be themselves"
pinkfloyd,38c1vk,RegularNameWasTaken,2,Wed Jun 3 08:07:04 2015 UTC,"Sure, I would agree with you about them not fully capturing everything that is not the album, but on the other hand I find many of the solos from that live performance to be better. For example the Breathe intro with that super-slick tone and the roaring solos of Money and Any Colour You Like."
pinkfloyd,38c1vk,DeepDingo,2,Wed Jun 3 08:18:45 2015 UTC,"Would have to agree. I picked up Pulse the other week, and listened to it through. Dark Side is not good on it at all."

pinkfloyd,38c1vk,MaxCHEATER64,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:11:00 2015 UTC,Every live version of Have a Cigar I've heard is awful. The guitar solo at the end is trash compared to the album version.
pinkfloyd,38c1vk,GusFringus,6,Thu Jun 4 17:32:37 2015 UTC,Welcome to the Machine. They always butchered the vocal on the 75 and 77 tours. Roger did it much better on his solo tours by letting the backup singers handle the high notes.
pinkfloyd,38c1vk,dukemantee,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:14:06 2015 UTC,Yeah this. Even when I saw Australian Pink Floyd (who put on an amazing fucking show btw) they didn't really do a very good job of it either. The sound effects were just...off.
pinkfloyd,38c1vk,Heatinmyharbl,6,Thu Jun 4 03:17:22 2015 UTC,"AMLOR tour versions of Echoes. ""Maybe it was missing a grumpy bass player"" - David, on why Echoes didnt really ""work"" and thus was dropped from the set list early on in the tour, suggesting rather sarcastically that perhaps the track needed to have Roger present (which his (David's) solo performances of Echoes 20 years later clearly shows it didnt, as those were excellent)."
pinkfloyd,38c1vk,GroovingPict,2,Wed Jun 3 16:05:08 2015 UTC,"They did Echoes as the opener at the Philadelphia 1987 show, there's a great bootleg of that concert. My uncle was at that show."

pinkfloyd,38c1vk,bluegrassgazer,2,Wed Jun 3 14:55:52 2015 UTC,Nothing beats the studio version for me. That song really benefits from the preciseness of a studio recording imo.

pinkfloyd,38c1vk,Derpy_Bird,2,Wed Jun 3 23:07:14 2015 UTC,I for the most part hate live recordings and unfortunately Floyd doesn't have many exceptions. Most live recordings have a hollow sound as if they're being played in a tunnel and often have major parts of the song missing. The only Floyd live recordings I enjoy are Pompeii & Ummugumma (which has weak sounding vocals imho). I love the songs Embryo and Moonhead. I only listen to them live because Moonhead didn't have an offical release and Embryo had a disappointing version released. Nearly all the songs on Dsot and Pulse sound like lethargic versions of themselves especially Shine On You Crazy Diamond.
pinkfloyd,38c1vk,OhTheHueManatee,2,Wed Jun 3 18:42:16 2015 UTC,"On the Run.   I just feel that a track that is made up of entirely effect loops is slightly disappointing on a live recording, as you may aswell be listening to the studio recording.   However, I've never actually heard it live, so what do I know?"
pinkfloyd,38c1vk,UsNotThem,2,Wed Jun 3 18:46:37 2015 UTC,"If the acoustics at the venues were good, I could see it being pretty damn cool live."

pinkfloyd,38c1vk,UsNotThem,2,Wed Jun 3 19:30:43 2015 UTC,The Travel Song is overall a better song but in the end I feel On the Run works better with Dark Side.
pinkfloyd,38c1vk,megamando,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:55:10 2015 UTC,"I haven't found a good version of Dogs live. And yes, I've heard Oakland 1977.  On the other hand, I think Echoes was better live (either at Pompeii or Remember that Night for completely different reasons) and Atom Heart Mother was better live. There was much more ""life"" to them."

pinkfloyd,38a8hx,i_tune_to_dropD,2,Wed Jun 3 01:29:57 2015 UTC,My friend's history teacher saw that show... He told us that he hated it........ I assume he's one of a kind
pinkfloyd,38a8hx,MakesShitUp4Fun,2,Wed Jun 3 01:36:08 2015 UTC,"Don't quote me but I heard that, out of the half-dozen or so US shows, most of them had serious production issues with the props and had to pause before continuing. Maybe the teacher saw one of the bad ones. I was lucky to see it in Nassau Coliseum on Long Island, where the show went off without a hitch. My only complaint (at the time) was that, since the stage was a mess of broken wall pieces at the end, the only ""encore"" was the entire troupe walking through the rubble singing ""Outside the Wall"" a capella (I think there might have been a flute or two, too).  Of course, as a Floyd fan, I wanted a full encore of tunes from other albums, but that didn't happen."
pinkfloyd,38a8hx,i_tune_to_dropD,2,Wed Jun 3 01:54:42 2015 UTC,Yeah I remember hearing something about that as well  And with such a big production I could imagine that many things would go wrong I just wish I knew of Pink Floyd when Roger Waters came around in 2011!
pinkfloyd,38a8hx,MakesShitUp4Fun,2,Wed Jun 3 02:22:55 2015 UTC,"many things would go wrong   You can say that again! lol  I mean, there was a 20' long plane flying down from the overhead rafters, things being set on fire on the stage, breaking glass, hundreds of roadies building the wall, Gilmour standing on top of it, Waters inside it... I remember a guy sitting behind my group who had been dragged there by his friends. Before the show started, he was moaning about how he didn't want to be there. After the wall came down, the dude was standing on his seat, screaming at the top of his lungs that PF was the best band in history. (Of course, the thick pall of pot smoke that filled the arena might have had something to do with that.)"

The Wall was my first album and still as great as it was ten first time I listened to it, and the movie is awesome too, and I've always been partial to Dark Side of the Moon.   But it doesn't get any better than Animals, musically and lyrically. Any song on the album could be someone's favorite, but part of my love for it was the progression. The desperation of Dogs, the anger of Pigs (Three Different Ones), the ruthlessness of Sheep, and the upbeat maturity of Pigs on the Wing come together almost seamlessly, and I guarantee that you will never forget the album. It also reminds me of Mad Men, my favorite television show."

pinkfloyd,389c9z,GroovingPict,5,Tue Jun 2 20:30:44 2015 UTC,"The symbolism in that message relates Roger's relationship with his wife and the fictional characters' relationship in The Wall.  Carolyn was Roger's wife at the time and she called him frequently to keep communication consistent between them.  In The Wall, Pink would avoid his wife (like the scene in the film where she comes home as he's watching tv and he ignores her while she tries to seduce him) frequently.  Carolyn and Roger force conversation between each other because without pushing to do it, they'd fall apart like Pink and his wife did in The Wall.  So this backwards message ties another story about Roger Waters into the album that makes it partly autobiographic"

pinkfloyd,3887bl,MikaelHB,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:26:40 2015 UTC,"A lot of stuff on Piper were inspired by or influenced by literary works.  The album title itself comes from chapter 7 of The Wind in the Willows, by Kenneth Grahame. (the chapter is titled ""The Piper at the Gates of Dawn"", just like the album).  Lucifer Sam is influenced by I Ching (though not as directly as Chapter 24).  Matilda Mother is inspired by the children's verse Cautionary Tales, by Hilaire Belloc.  Flaming, perhaps not directly inspired by, but certainly influenced by, The Wind in the Willows.  Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk. A Waters composition, rather than Barrett, so not inspired by I Ching or children's literature. But perhaps worth mentioning that even this piece references a literary work in its title. Namely the Bible. (""Take up thy bed and walk"", Matt.9:6; Mark.2:11; John.5:11)  Interstellar Overdrive. Inspired by another piece of music, rather than literary work: ""The main musical theme evolved from the band Love's version of the Burt Bacharach / Hal David song My Little Red Book, which was hummed to Syd Barrett by Peter Jenner"".  The Gnome. No prizes for guessing that this was inspired by Lord of the Rings, by Tolkien."

pinkfloyd,385qd3,iriey,2,Tue Jun 2 05:52:34 2015 UTC,"My favorite song is definitely Go Fishing.  I also like the string of the first three songs together, particularly Running Shoes.  In fact, with the exception of Go Fishing, I think the first side of the record is far better than the second.  I think TPACOHH is a decent album, but than again I tend to like that strained half talked/half maniacal shouting and screaming vocal style Roger used around that time.  Vocally it definitely has some similarities with the previous year's Final Cut.  The lyrics are sharp, and the band is quite good for a solo outing.  I've actually never been huge on Clapton, I don't dislike him, but I've never been particularly enamored with him either, but I like his playing on this record a lot.  The solo on Sexual Revolution is pretty fantastic.  But most notably, I'm a musician myself and tend to focus on musicianship a lot, and Andy Newmark's drumming is out of this world.    The record certainly ""reaches"" as far as the concept, and it can definitely be a bit much, but if you take it for what it is, I find it very enjoyable.    Let it be said that I've been an obsessive Floyd fan for many years now, and never really cared for this record and hadn't listened to it in some 15 years until I recently took it back out just a few months ago.  I guess over time my expectations for it lowered and I was surprised to find I actually liked it."

Even though it is Clapton on guitar it sounds, to my ears, nothing like Pink Floyd and sounds like 100% a Roger Waters solo album, more then his others by far (This and KAOS imo are true Waters solo albums where as Amused to Death ,a kickass record on its own as is, could've been a Pink Floyd record for sure.  A very good Pink Floyd record.)  That being said if you are a Floyd fan you owe it to yourself to listen to the album a few times.  You won't like it at first but it grows on you.  But if you're looking for epic Gilmour solos you won't find them here but there are some powerful, emotional songs esp. if you pay attention to the lyrics and theme of the record."

I'm listening to Pros And Cons now ... I's cool. Roger's singing is really impressive there and I like Clapton's guitar and sax a lot so I think I'm going to like it.

A Momentary Lapse Of Reason, to me, is a little bit better than Radio KAOS. They're both very good, but kind of weird in tone and production.  Amused To Death and The Division Bell are miles ahead of both KAOS and AMLOR. I think The Division Bell is better, but they're both better than any album made by Floyd or a Floyd member in the '80s.  If they were released under the name ""Pink Floyd"", Pros And Cons would be one of the most massive flops by a major artist ever, Radio KAOS would have done okay, but below-average for Floyd's standards, and Amused To Death would have been almost as big of a commercial hit as The Division Bell was.  Though I might be wrong about Amused To Death. It only got to 7th on the UK album charts, while On An Island by David got to #1. Amused To Death would have gone to the top of the charts under the Pink Floyd name, but it wouldn't have been as big as On An Island would have if it were a Pink Floyd album.  Still, in my opinion, Amused To Death is better than On An Island. Just less marketable, I guess."
pinkfloyd,382tbd,Leftieswillrule,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:50:54 2015 UTC,"Pros and Cons could not have survived in the form it exists had the rest of Pink Floyd participated. Aside from the vastly different play style of Eric Clapton and David Gilmour (I'm looking at you ""Sexual Revolution""), the album structure would have been the first thing changed.  Waters really went overboard with the whole ""the album is one long song"" thing. The story is great and the concept is fine, but the first thing I thought when I first heard it was that it was wildly unrefined compared to other PF productions. Of course, that led to wild moments of badassery like ""Arabs with Knives and West German Skies"" and ""Running Shoes"", but things would have been much less spontaneous. The pacing of the songs, particularly the fact that only 3 or 4 work as self-contained ""songs"" would have been very different, with songs ending the way songs do and not bleeding into others without a smooth transition.  Assuming this is the Final Cut line-up and Rick is still chilling with Mel Collins, Gilmour and Mason's contributions would be minimal, essentially including more solos, tighter drums, and somewhat more melodic runs in the background. As a result it wouldn't be as dreamlike as it is, which is partially the point but takes away from how accessible it is.  Unlike the other commenter, I highly doubt it would be a flop, in fact for the casual fans it would be a welcome change from the overwhelmingly political Floyd from the previous three albums (although the Wall stands in it's own category). I bet it would be commercially successful enough to postpone their breakup and there's a very real possibility that thanks to Gilmour's tempering influence and Roger's inherent musicality, 80's Floyd would never reach AMLOR or Radio Kaos and proceed straight to Amused to Death. That is something I'd like to see, ""Three Wishes"" or ""The Bravery of Being out of Range"" with Gilmour on guitar."

What Waters is trying to say is that Syd represented the sadness of reality, and that the song was addressing Syd as a metonym for that.  i'm not sure if I agree with him, but I don't think he's trying to deny that the song was about Syd."

Vera and Bring The Boys Back Home are essential parts of the buildup of The Wall. I like Have A Cigar, and I believe that for all its bad back story The Final Cut is an excellent album.

I know you want to introduce them to PF, but if they don't like it, they don't like it. You can't really enforce this onto people.  Typically I find that when people personally find something that they like, they will enjoy it much better as compared to someone else who has introduced the same thing to them, if you understand what I'm saying.  So maybe they'll discover Pink Floyd one day themselves, or get into them based on your recommendations. But if they don't - no biggie. You can always enjoy yourself :)"

If you play them any song on party or in front of more people, they cant enjoy it, or understand it that well. If I really want to enjoy Floyd music I need to be alone, sit back, close my eyes and be 100% focused on music and feel it.   The second important part is to listen to it more than just one time. I really disliked most of Floyd song after first listen. I need to get each song under my skin. Then I starting to realizing and discovering the beauty. Really interesting for me is that the songs I disliked (skipped) most at first time, I absolutely love after some time. Like ""Dogs"" for example. I hated that song on first listen, then I skipped it every time for like 2 weeks. And then I accidentally listen to it few more times and now it's one of my favourites songs."

pinkfloyd,37qx1i,Endxsor,3,Fri May 29 18:07:38 2015 UTC,"Two observations:   The latest album still hasn't settled in my brain as a PF album, I was wondering, what solo album is 'Calling' from. Anthony Moore, who made the Broken China album with Richard Wright is responsible for Calling (3:38) and it certainly has the mood of that pretty depressed, and unfortunately underestimated, album. The atmosphere is somewhat reminiscent of David Bowie's Warszawa, it is an ambient and dark and haunting piece. It is a nice thing from Gilmour to have added this obvious nod to Rick's solo album and one of the more interesting pieces of the album."

pinkfloyd,37pfos,gm4,2,Fri May 29 11:39:17 2015 UTC,"I think there is a good case to be made for Syd being a huge factor in Gilmour's noodling period. Inheriting the echo and slide stuff was probably done for some sort of continuity, and we all know Gilmour was one of the first to get tired of the pre-Obscured by Clouds/Meddle period and get into more bluesy rock. Fortunately the consequence of the echo gave us the classic soaring Gilmour we all love."
pinkfloyd,37pfos,sacred-pepper,3,Fri May 29 15:43:08 2015 UTC,"I think the band would not have ventured into more expansive sounds throughout their discography if it weren't for the influence of Syd's psychedelic style.  Also the theme of the lyrics would have changed; for example, I don't think Roger would have been so interested in mental health/""insanity"", nor would Wish You Were Here be made aside from maybe the two tracks about the music industry."
pinkfloyd,37pfos,lettis,2,Fri May 29 12:18:03 2015 UTC,"there would be no pink floyd without syd, syd wrote all their music and gave the band direction a place and a purpose.   If David was in from the start they would never have got into the psychedelic sound which means they would of never played at UFO in the london underground scene which means they could well have never been picked up by a manager etc and could have easily faded into time as another late 60's wanna-be beetles band.   i think syd had a way with waters, roger as we know is a super control freak yet somehow syd dirrected the band in the begining, i think something about syd kept roger in line, if david was the front man roger probably would have directed the whole thing which might not have been bad....  there is a good chance we would miss out on things like saucerful of secrets and echoes etc i think dsotm and the wall would have still happened in some form"
pinkfloyd,37pfos,SomeRandomBuddy,1 point,Fri May 29 18:08:25 2015 UTC,"That would be because Syd founded it, and they were all young guys. I'm not sure Roger was a control freak yet. That was more toward the 80s, when the Wall was worked on, after Roger had written a bazillion songs and subsequently decided that he knew best when composing new works for the band Edit: In Roger We Trust"

It has the raw energy the song should have had from the beginning. I loathe Primus's version of the same song btw; I dont understand why it became so popular among fans.  Are solo covers allowed? REM did a nice cover of Syd's Dark Globe, and The Smashing Pumpkins did Terrapin.  Hawkwind did a decent cover of Interstellar Overdrive  Since you enjoyed Bowie's Emily, perhaps youll like his Arnold as well.  How about a cover of an unreleased Pink Floyd song? The Jesus and Mary Chain did Vegetable Man  But of course the best ever Pink Floyd cover is this ;)"

I've been obsessed with them since. Got really into the Wall in my teens and by 20 their whole catalog was about all I listened to. Now its a lot of blues but my main enjoyment is always Floyd and Gilmour. Plus they got me playing guitar daily...thanks to Gilmour."

pinkfloyd,37bcce,pinkpanthers,2,Tue May 26 14:55:42 2015 UTC,well there is certainly a lot of psychedelic influence in the album. For example some of the riffs in war pigs and the entirety of planet caravan.   I'd say the heaviest song on the album is iron man.

Floyd at times has been considered prog. Thus it shouldn't surprise anyone. They hated Zep back in the day, and Sabbath. They generally hook onto what ever they like, and never give anything else a fair chance."
pinkfloyd,37bcce,extraflux,3,Tue May 26 18:45:23 2015 UTC,They said Zeppelin was not going anywhere. They have no respect for them. Personally Led Zeppelin is my favorite band ever (floyd a close second) and I have never agreed with anything Rollin Stone has said about either bands

pinkfloyd,37bcce,Anticitizen_01,2,Tue May 26 16:49:33 2015 UTC,Four of the top ten are Beatles albums.  I think that says all we need to know about this list.

pinkfloyd,37bcce,goethean_,2,Tue May 26 23:21:46 2015 UTC,"The Beatles and Nirvana are two of my most favorite bands, but I agree with you, they get played up way more than they should.  A lot of it seems to come down to the ""le wrong generation"" type people that listen to Imagine and Hey Jude and immediately go batshit insane over The Beatles and Lennon then run around preaching about peace or claiming to be 21st century hippies, it's bullshit. Or the people that hear Smells like teen spirit and act like Nirvana is the epitome of music without knowing jack shit about the band or listening to anything else by them.    Both bands have made absolutely kick ass music, but it would have been nice to see more artsy (I guess) albums in the top 10, albums that really make you think about what you're listening to and have more depth, something like DSoTM."

Rolling Stone will always be a problem for guys like us. Most of the great art in the world is about that very problem. Rolling Stone--they got no spine, their art never lasts. And they get the girls, but we're smarter....'cause great art is about guilt and longing, and, you know, love disguised as sex, and sex disguised as love, and hey, let's face it, you've got a big head start... I'm always home, I'm uncool.... the only true currency in this bankrupt world is that you share Pink Floyd with someone else when you're uncool.

I really like the title but the thing is (and I am quite ashamed of stating this) I am a listener of Pink Floyd's music, not an analyst. So, if you could explain me the title that would be great.

pinkfloyd,37chse,rolandboard,4,Tue Jun 2 17:08:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would buy Nick's book, ""Inside Out A Personal History of Pink Floyd"".  Give it a good read and while you go, write down some main ideas and details you find most fascinating.  When finished, narrow those down so you can write what you are most interested in.  It will make the writing go faster, and your passion will show in your work."

pinkfloyd,37c8t9,Wavyhill,3,Tue May 26 15:48:49 2015 UTC,"Not my clip, but I was there both nights. The first night was Ron Geesin on his own ('his own' being defined as a choir, brass section cellist and Italian Floyd covers band), the second night had Gilmour on guitar.    Both nights were amazing but obviously the highlight was the second one - partly because it's one of my favourite Floyd pieces, partly because it almost never gets played live by anyone, and partly because you knew damn well that this was likely the last time that Gilmour would ever play this live.    The band was a bit shaky on the first night but very tight on the second - despite the pressure that they must have felt.    And yes, it was awesome."

The first set was Geesin's own stuff, a mixture of poetry and odd instrumental things, and the second half was Atom Heart Mother.    It was different to the original by the way. Apparently the choral section in the studio recording was a beat behind, which drove Geesin mad every time he heard it. So when they did it live this time, they went through that section twice; once as it was on the recording, and once on the beat, as he'd written it. It was a subtle difference but interesting nonetheless.    Gilmour played his lap steel for most of it and stood up to play the middle strat solo. I think it was a black strat with a white pickguard, and he even got that scratchy Atom Heart Mother tone out of it, which was a nice touch."

pinkfloyd,378dzm,PinkFloydBot,1 point,Mon May 25 18:42:35 2015 UTC,I'm starting to get into this album by listening to it every few weeks. Good song! Really catchy chorus.

pinkfloyd,374yw6,Fishrex,2,Mon May 25 07:45:41 2015 UTC,Cool. :)
pinkfloyd,374yw6,GristleCZ,10,Mon May 25 18:45:42 2015 UTC,"I think she does, considering her vocal improvisation is so instrumental to the track."
pinkfloyd,374yw6,GroovingPict,7,Sun May 24 23:42:34 2015 UTC,She was directed insofar as being told to improvise a wordless vocalization on top of the track. It's her creativity in doing so that defines the song.
pinkfloyd,374z7d,PinkFloydBot,8,Sun May 24 22:42:43 2015 UTC,"This song contains my favorite moment in The Wall (the music drop that accompanies ""Why are you running away! Oo""). The tension building through the song is all released through what can only be described as a musical orgasm. Brilliant."
pinkfloyd,374z7d,Guggoo,7,Mon May 25 00:02:51 2015 UTC,Nice vocals and instrumental section near the end. The part in The Wall movie with this song really hit me in the feels...

pinkfloyd,374z7d,Raisedkaine,5,Mon May 25 05:38:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not huge on The Wall, but this song really helps create the dark atmosphere that Roger was trying to accomplish with this album."
pinkfloyd,374z7d,Sluggishunicorn,3,Mon May 25 14:37:56 2015 UTC,"Truly beautiful. Watched the Wall with my dad today, seen it many times and it is different every time I watch."
pinkfloyd,374z7d,Derpy_Bird,3,Mon May 25 02:11:24 2015 UTC,"This song is really dark. ""To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night, oh babe."" God damn man."
pinkfloyd,374z7d,GroovingPict,4,Mon May 25 17:20:35 2015 UTC,"you kinda need the lyrics right before that as well: ""How could you go, when you know how I need you to beat to a pulp on a saturday night"". The pause in the song makes it seem they are separate, but it is really one sentence. The pause also serves to make the listener go ""aw, he is desperately needing her, he loves her so much""... and then the last bit of the sentence comes."
pinkfloyd,374z7d,Derpy_Bird,2,Mon May 25 18:29:09 2015 UTC,You're right actually. It just kind of slipped my mind to include the first part of it.

pinkfloyd,374z7d,KIMrPickle,5,Wed May 27 02:31:13 2015 UTC,"From The Wall Analysis: ""Pink mentally lashes out at his adulterous wife, alternating between threatening her and begging her to come back to him.""  EDIT: In other words, it's all in his head. These are threats he is making to her in his head. Kind of like if you get into an argument with someone and think after ""I will beat the fucking shit out of him the next time I see him"". That's basically what Pink is doing."

pinkfloyd,374z7d,Wdeflect,2,Wed May 27 22:52:53 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite The Wall songs. When it's played live there's a strumming guitar or plucking or something, and it's really pretty."

pinkfloyd,373xft,Mughi,14,Tue Jun 9 22:43:37 2015 UTC,"I dig ""Seamus."" Haters gonna hate, I suppose. Maybe people just don't expect a blues song from PF."
pinkfloyd,373xft,youvegottabecrazy,6,Sun May 24 18:11:09 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you're right.    Here's what I most like about Seamus:  PF was founded as a blues band.  It's even named after two blues musicians.  Seamus is the most bluesy song I've heard from PF, and it's placed on Meddle, right before Echoes, which is the song and style that pointed the way to DSOTM, which defined the band's style for most of the 70's.    Seamus, probably written and recorded as a joke, is the most bluesy song in this blues band's repertoire, and it's the last song that ""blues"" band played.  That first note in Echoes heralded the arrival of a whole different band.  That's poetic, no?"
pinkfloyd,373xft,GristleCZ,2,Mon May 25 11:40:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've thought of that as well. Echoes seems to me like it's the first really Dark Side-like Waters-style song on the catalog"
pinkfloyd,373xft,Chrisiztopher,8,Tue Jun 9 22:45:42 2015 UTC,I absolutely love it. But it's probably because im a big blues fan besides Pink Floyd.
pinkfloyd,373xft,ragby,3,Sun May 24 20:57:23 2015 UTC,"Yep, I love it. Eargasm at the final guitar solo"
pinkfloyd,373xft,Darth_Kyofu,2,Sun May 24 22:28:28 2015 UTC,So true.  Love the Man and Journey versions
pinkfloyd,373xft,ragby,2,Sun May 24 23:26:05 2015 UTC,Me too.  I wish PF had done a few more blues songs.
pinkfloyd,373xft,TobyCelery,4,Sun May 24 22:15:24 2015 UTC,"Just wondering, have you heard Biding My Time? If not, you'll probably like it."
pinkfloyd,373xft,ragby,1 point,Sun May 24 22:47:49 2015 UTC,"Have definitely heard it.  In fact, I'm wondering if there is a Pink Floyd song I haven't heard/don't know.  Maybe some stuff from bootlegs.  Anyway, Biding My Time is ok but I like sort of heavier blues stuff with lots of guitar.  :)  Like 'Blues - Slow' from More."
pinkfloyd,373xft,ISwearImRW,3,Mon May 25 17:44:12 2015 UTC,Lots of earlier concerts usually consisted of some blues jams.

pinkfloyd,373xft,comfortablytrev,4,Sun May 24 18:46:14 2015 UTC,"Pink Floyd has always been named a serious band, but they had a funny side as well, especially in the early days. After Dark Side they didn't allow themselves any more to act silly, unfortunately."

pinkfloyd,374ry5,KIMrPickle,1 point,Tue May 26 04:07:43 2015 UTC,No problem. I was expecting the second half to kick in and noticed I suddenly was singing by myself. I still finished the song going solo.

(The prism cannot be copyrighted). The text is also a tribute, no lyrics. It reads; A landmark album that stayed 720 weeks on the billboard top 200. The longest ever for an album. Despite numerous efforts to elucidate the mysteries of its success, the ubiquitous popularity of this record remains an enigma.  It's a great idea though.

Honestly wished they would have replaced Set the Controls with something else this year since they played it last year. Ecstatic that they are playing a good hunk of The Wall as well.

pinkfloyd,36yggk,andres92,0,Sat May 23 14:10:40 2015 UTC,"I saw them in South Bend back in March.  It was simply amazing.  I went to see them for the sole reason that I will never be able to PF, but I tell you what: I will be going to see them again because they were THAT good.    I have to admit....I was not a fan of The Final Cut before I saw them.  Their version of the titular track (The Final Cut) with the images and lights was just spectacular.   I have now listened to that entire album with a more open mind and have come to respect it like all of the others.    Anywho, I'm glad you enjoyed the show.  It really speaks to Pink's influence when a tribute band can tour multiple continents playing their music.    Edit: Picture from the show in South Bend."

pinkfloyd,36yggk,Strwrsbob,0,Tue May 26 13:24:19 2015 UTC,"Just saw them in Syracuse 2 nights ago - great show.  Theater was about 3/4 full, crowd was quiet during songs but gave loud ovations after.  Only complaint was the crowd didn't even try to get an encore.  We were there stamping our feet, cheering and yelling for encore and everyone else is just leaving, very confusing.  Maybe that's how it is, did other who have seen them play elsewhere get an encore?  We brought someone who wasn't really a Pink Floyd fan and during intermission we went to get a beer and she was like ""This is 3000x times better then what I expected!""    Set list is about what you would expect; they played most of the ""hits"" and See Emily Play, set the controls (Roger's Egyptian style) and 1 or 2 other surprises.  The music itself was an ""A"" no doubt with only a few miscues here or there, no big deal.  The lighting and stage show, again, an ""A-"" the only complaint is that the wall graphics looked a bit underwhelming, especially compared to most of the rest of the show which had excellent graphics.  Time for an update but really that was my only slight issue.  The vocals, well trying to emulate David and Roger are tough but they did a really good job and the girl on Great Gig was awesome.  Vocals overall a ""B+"" mainly cause of the difficulty of the task, not a lack of talent of effort.  If you're a Floyd fan, especially a younger one who never got to see the band live, go see this band asap if you can.  It is as close as you're gonna get to the real thing.    Last thing - kinda funny, tickets were $35.00 for floor seats, I could easily see all the members of the band clearly, my tickets for Pink Floyd for the Delicate Sound tour were only $37.50 and Roger Waters on the ""In The Flesh"" Tour were $40.

pinkfloyd,36wf7k,GroovingPict,2,Mon May 25 17:54:50 2015 UTC,"Some trivia (although not really much to say):  Written in 1968 by Roger and was originally intended for Ummagumma, but was left out (I guess Roger liked Several Species better ;) ).  Was performed and recorded for BBC's Top Gear (no not the car program) in December 1968. Which is rather different from how they later performed it, as evidenced by this BBC recording from 1971.  Performed throughout 1970-1971, apart from that first 1968 performance.  Studio recording released on the Harvest sampler ""Picnic - A Breath of Fresh Air"" in 1970, which also featured Syd Barrett's Terrapin.  Also appeared in 1983 on the North American Pink Floyd compilation/best of ""Works""."
pinkfloyd,36wf7k,GroovingPict,2,Mon May 25 18:05:13 2015 UTC,"I absolutely adore the live versions of Embryo that they did in 1970-1971.  I was always under the impression that this and Biding My Time were victims of the decision to do individual pieces on Ummagumma.    The early versions of the Embryo included a section where David first did the ""seagull"" effect that later became famous in Echoes.    Also, the last time they ever played it was in November of 1971, there was an equipment malfunction with some of Richard's stuff.  While the road crew worked to rectify the problem, Floyd played the longest version of the Embryo they ever (28 minutes) did with tons of improvisations.  During part of the song, you can hear David in particular start playing part of what would become ""Breathe"".  Two months later they would debut Dark Side in it's ""embryonic"" form.

My grandfather (who I never got to meet) recorded reel to reel tapes in the '60s of classical music & him placing a phone call from Philadelphia to Miama (including the operator's transfer & my Grandmother in the background). It was really cool listening to that on tape (during the digitizing transfer process). Maybe you should give the tape one more spin, and record the line out to your PC direct?

pinkfloyd,36sek2,Buck1Mulligan,3,Thu May 21 19:14:03 2015 UTC,It's important to note that the tape itself has never been made available. The bootleg that circulates is a recording made at an event where the tape was played. So it's an audience tape of an audience tape and the quality suffers because of it.  Also be warned that Syd's vocals are entirely drowned out by the other instruments. You can hear Roger's vocal a tiny bit but Syd's are not audible. This is why EMI decided not to release the tape. It's just not very good.

pinkfloyd,36s41b,PinkFloydBot,7,Thu May 21 18:00:16 2015 UTC,"Some trivia:  An early version was recorded as a demo during the Meddle sessions, but nothing more came of it then (obviously).  Working titles: ""The Lunatic Song"", ""The Dark Side of the Moon"".  The ""grass"" mentioned in the lyrics is the lawn behind King's College Chapel in Cambridge.  A song directly about lunacy cannot not be at least somewhat inspired by Syd, particularly in the line ""and if the band you're in starts playing different tunes"", which may refer to one or both of two things: the fact that Pink Floyd had now moved on and were playing different tunes than when Syd was in it, but could also be a reference to the fact that, during Syd's worst days, Syd would just stand on stage, strumming his guitar, the rest of the band playing a different tune than what tune was going on inside Syd's head at the time and indeed coming out of his guitar.  During the Pink Floyd concert in Earl's Court, 1994-10-28, as a birthday gift from his friend David Gilmour, Douglas Adams (authour of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) got to play guitar on this song and Eclipse. (Sidenote: it was also Adams who came up with the idea of using ""The Division Bell"" as an album title... a suggestion he charged David £10,000 for in the form of a donation to the Environmental Investigation Agency... which, considering the working title for the album at the time was ""Pow Wow"", I think was well worth the money ;) ).  The spoken words heard during the song are by Peter Watts, engineer and road manager for Pink Floyd, and also father of actress Naomi Watts (he is also pictured on the back cover of Ummagumma)."

It wasn't until Bristol on Feb 5 that Eclipse was finished and officially tacked onto the end of Brain Damage, making the 1-2 punch that many people consider one song together."

You could upload a photo (or digital scan of a painting you find on the internet) of your choosing and print it to a canvas through this service or another similar website, of which there are many.  Alternatively, you could just search ""pink floyd canvas print"" on google. There are a few websites which sell prints of Pink Floyd related art, like this one which has a varied selection.   Or, if you've got a lot of money to spend, you could commission a local artist to do an actual painting for you on a canvas. If you can't find a local artist, there's plenty of willing people on the internet to do it for you, though I would imagine that it would incur some serious shipping charges, and dealing with people over the internet is always a bit iffy. Of course you'd be spending a great deal more, depending on the materials and the complexity of the painting, but it's still an option nonetheless."

I think Dave would've taken charge of the band after a couple of syd led stuff. This would cause tension, I few spectacular albums and then I think syd would've quit and we would end up With more of the trio albums."
pinkfloyd,36owgj,Rhuey13,8,Thu May 21 00:22:30 2015 UTC,"Imo, they wouldn't have lasted very long at all, most likely would have died along with the Psychedelic era."
pinkfloyd,36owgj,mrw412,3,Wed May 20 23:46:17 2015 UTC,They would have most likely survived up until the mid 70s but wouldn't be as famous because their style wouldn't change and they would be lacking the same fairytale type story that went along with Syd Barrett leaving the band.
pinkfloyd,36owgj,squid_gang727,4,Thu May 21 02:46:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think they would have lasted long.    Syd was the creative force behind early Floyd.  The record company wanted Syd, not the others.  Syd's departure from the band created a vacuum which necessitated a good deal of experimentation. (See, e.g., Ummagumma).  The experimentation led to creative collaboration, which helped the group find a new sound.  Had Syd stuck around I think he'd have kept creative control, and I think they would have continued to shoot for pop hits in the same vein as Arnoyd Layne and Apples & Oranges.  Basically a poor mans Beatles.  That's what the record company wanted, and Syd seemed happy to produce songs that fit the bill.  It's interesting to think about.    Somewhat related, I once saw a docu about Queen.  Before they were Queen (and before Freddy) they were called ""Smile.""    Before joining Queen, Brian May and Roger Taylor had been playing together in a band named Smile with bassist Tim Staffell. Freddie Mercury (then known by his birth name of Farrokh ""Freddie"" Bulsara) was a fan of Smile, and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques after Staffell's departure in 1970. Mercury himself joined the band shortly thereafter, changed the name of the band to ""Queen"", and adopted his familiar stage name.   Staffel left because he had an offer to play in another band, a band with an existing recording contract.  The other band members didn't seem too enthusiastic about Freddie joining the band.  Brian May said something that essentially boiled down to, ""well, we need someone, and this Freddie guy is always around.  I don't know if he can sing.  What's the worst that could happen?""  Staffel was interviewed in that same docu,where he said something like, ""Thank god I left the band. Otherwise the world would be poorer for never having Freddie & Queen.""    I can't help but the think the same way about Syd.  I appreciate all he did for the band, and the band would not have existed if not for Syd.  But it's a good thing that he left."

But to me PF is the yin and yang of Roger's creative obsession and Dave's musical philosophy, and without one or the other the group couldn't have possibly become what they did.  To me they are like a midfield pairing where you have the creative flair player (Dave), and the hard-nosed player who can go and get the ball for you (Roger). They needed each other to be successful."

pinkfloyd,36owgj,lettis,0,Fri May 29 18:32:12 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't have survived the end of the psychedelic era. Syd's style was very pop-oriented and it's not like anybody else was going to go invent prog without Roger needing a backdrop for his lyrics.  King Crimson and Yes were bringing in prog whether Floyd was there or not, and with Syd remaining in charge it's likely that Floyd would have gone the way of pretty much every other psych band from the 60s."

I like to take it for what it is, a little experimental sound used by Gilmour to bookend Terminal Frost.    Trivia: ""A New Machine has a sound I've never heard anyone do. The noise gates, the Vocoders, opened up something new which to me seemed like a wonderful sound effect that no one had done before; it's innovation of a sort."" — David Gilmour  The two songs were the first Pink Floyd songs to be credited solely to David Gilmour since ""Childhood's End"", from their 1972 album Obscured by Clouds.

It reminds me of the spoken word biblical passage Psalm 23 in Sheep.  Personally, I think dropping Part 2 and just putting Part 1 at the beginning of Terminal Frost (so it's not its own track) would've been more effective. This song gets too much hate considering what its purpose is, just a bookend for Terminal Frost.  The live version is pretty cool too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Sr69J5a2_E"

pinkfloyd,36m4b1,Onedwa,3,Wed May 20 13:09:18 2015 UTC,"the only album that he underutilized was The Wall.   You know, I'm not sure The Wall (as it ended up) really could have used much more of Rick, because I don't really think he fit in with the whole sound of the album.  I was listening to the live version of The Wall about a month ago (which I hadn't heard in a few years, and I almost never listen to the studio version either) -- and Rick's extra solos really stood out as seeming out of place from his own (regular) aesthetic.  I love Rick's contributions to the whole Floyd sound, but I'm not sure The Wall had room for him, even if he had been more an active part of the process."
pinkfloyd,36m4b1,Rooster_Ties,1 point,Wed May 20 13:38:35 2015 UTC,"The thing is, Rick was never into solo's. This is quite odd when you look at other 70's rock bands: a lot of keyboard solos.   Also, it's not just a case of whether he not he would 'fit in' to the Wall (No pun intended), from what I've read Roger was a bit of a D*ck to Rick, and may have been the reason that he was limited to the background noise with piano's/keyboards/organs (and of course he eventually left PF, so he probably didn't care much about the Wall).  I'll have to listen to the Live version when i have the chance."

pinkfloyd,36k7v3,GroovingPict,5,Wed May 20 04:57:46 2015 UTC,"When David first took over for Syd, one of the main critiques against him was that he was too similar to Syd; that he was just a copycat and stealing Syd's style. While in fact the reason was that they were buddies and partly learned to play together in their teens. As David himself put it at the time, ""I taught him some stuff and he taught me some stuff"".  Which is why it is amusing to me whenever someone makes a post about how radically different Syd and David are... theyre not... so much not, in fact, that David was accused of being a copycat."
pinkfloyd,36k7v3,BadInPublic,3,Wed May 20 14:21:04 2015 UTC,"Syd Barrett was excellent at making sound.  I actually prefer a lot of the Syd stuff, but I would never want to listen to Syd play lead on the Embryo...David is technically a far superior guitar player, whose style relies less on texture/dissonance and was a far more melodic player."
pinkfloyd,36k7v3,Rooster_Ties,2,Wed May 20 21:49:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe in the early years, but both would have matured (had Syd stayed sane) and their own style would have developed. Would Syd's stayed experimental (an early Robert Fripp?) and Dave's become what it has? Or would one or the other lived in obscurity?  The world will never know."
pinkfloyd,36k7v3,JManSenior918,4,Wed May 20 15:01:45 2015 UTC,"I've recently been listening to Animals and Wish You Were Here (the album) with fresh ears.  I'm in my mid 40's, and both albums have been my #1 & #2 Floyd favorites for going on 20 years.  Animals in particular, I'd really over-played about 10 years ago -- so when I first discovered Les Claypool's brilliant live remake of the complete Animals album, for about the last 6-7 years I've listened to that at least 3x as often as the original.  But with The Endless River now, and my deeper listening to it - I've gone back and am really hearing the guitar parts on Animals and WYWH in new ways.  All of Dave's incredible slide-work on sections of the Shine On suite.  All the sort of noisy, and definitely microtonal playing on Dogs and Sheep.  And I've been exploring all his great slide-work on the Fractals documentary, and the racing documentary -- and that album with The Orb.  And I'm astounded at how much ""exploratory"" Gilmour is out there from just the last 25 years.  Dave's a consummate professional, and his ability to recreate solos in concert is both amazing, and also a little frustrating (since they vary so little from the studio versions).  And yet, if you dig a little, there's TONS of experimental Gilmour out there."
pinkfloyd,36k7v3,Porcupine_Tree,9,Wed May 20 13:34:23 2015 UTC,"You're going to get some shit in the comments because people love to suck Rogers dick around here, but I agree with you completely. David didn't create the melodrama that Roger did, so in a way he never quite got the same attention. For example, if Animals hadn't been so brash and in your face, would people still hail it as one of the best albums? Personally, I don't think so.   David created very high quality music, and more consistently than Syd did. Syd was undoubtedly a genius (before he lost his mind) but even still, a lot of the material that ended up getting released was a little too experimental for many people. On the other hand, David knows how to push the envelope and explore new forms of musical expression while still making it sound very pleasing and he's been doing it for decades.  I truly believe that the reason both David and Richard don't get more attention is that they never stirred up too much drama. Syd lost his mind, and even before he did was always one to cause a scene. Leaving the stage in the middle of a song etc. We all know how Roger gets his attention, and regardless of if you think he's justified in his feelings or not, I think we can all agree that his actions cause his name to get thrown around a lot more than the others."

pinkfloyd,36k7v3,Porcupine_Tree,2,Wed May 20 21:50:00 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't give Gilmour TOO much credit for 68-73 Floyd... for instance when you say ""the echoes pummeling basses on One of These Days"", wouldn't that be more likely Roger's doing, seeing as he's the bassist? Besides, Waters took over as main songwriter after Syd left, and while David's songs are great, they certainly aren't the most experimental ones. If there's any greater indication for this it would be comparing the members' solo albums."
pinkfloyd,36k7v3,gm4,5,Wed May 20 09:36:28 2015 UTC,"One Of These Days was a terrible example, first of all Roger said that   was ""the most collaborative piece they every did"", and also, you think it was Roger's idea to run echo through the bass? The first bass you hear on that track is David."

pinkfloyd,36k7v3,gm4,1 point,Wed May 20 17:02:43 2015 UTC,"It illustrates my point. The Wall was one of two solo works by Waters. I am not disputing The Wall is a masterpiece mostly from Waters' head alone, but the most popular song on the album isn't a Waters song, and the rest of the ideas are made into emotional pieces by Bob Ezrin and David Gilmour for the most part.   I don't like these arguments because it tends to sound like I don't like Roger, which couldn't be further from the truth, but regarding the whole of Pink Floyd as a Roger force simply because you don't like what happened after he left is a fallacy to a pretty lengthy degree."
pinkfloyd,36k7v3,Chrisiztopher,1 point,Wed May 20 17:18:40 2015 UTC,"I actually quite like post-Waters floyd still, and even Gilmour's solo stuff. But i wouldn't ever dream of saying the emotion in Floyd came from Gilmour, because that's the one gaping flaw in all of his work, solo and later Floyd stuff. I mean there's a reason that almost every Floyd album before Waters left is fantastic and then the first one Gilmour does without him is mediocre at best"
pinkfloyd,36k7v3,Porcupine_Tree,1 point,Wed May 20 17:32:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know, you are being very subjective, which I think what most of this stuff boils down to anyway. I certainly would never argue that I would take post-Roger floyd over Roger floyd, but you may just be 'moved' by Roger's words for the most part and the themes, which is fine, I am too. However I am also heavily susceptible to musical score, which Roger just didn't have much to give in that area. And Momentary Lapse suffered the same way Radio KAOS did. Division Bell saw a return to basically DNR playing together rather than a horde of collaborators. Unfortunately Roger repeated this, albeit better than KAOS with Amnesia. And On An Island is surprisingly moving in many ways, The Blue has some of those old Floyd elements, incredible moving score and some emotional lyrics. Where We Start has some of the same.   I think if you look at the context of Gilmour's relationship with the band, having the maniacal idealist leave and being able to focus on making music with instruments was probably a very welcoming aspect.  All this being said, I saw the Wall in 2012, and that was great, but it was for the theatre, I really quite resented the sound of the band, besides a bit of Snowy. Gilmour has retained the atmosphere of the Floyd as a musical band, ie pre-Animals floyd, and he does it without the aid of theatrics, sort of back to the light show kind of thing. I think that it is one of the most convincing factors for me."
pinkfloyd,36k7v3,JManSenior918,7,Wed May 20 17:55:52 2015 UTC,Come on man David played bass as much as Roger did. He'd even have to tune the thing for him and the bass on One of These Days is both David and Roger
pinkfloyd,36k7v3,autowikibot,4,Wed May 20 10:26:47 2015 UTC,"As much as? Come on now. I'll concede one of these days bass is also david playing it, regardless of who wrote the material. The rest of my points still stand"
pinkfloyd,36k7v3,MaxCHEATER64,2,Wed May 20 11:29:34 2015 UTC,"David played one of the two basses on One of the Days.    Roger certainly wrote most of the songs, but David was the main musical force (along with Richard Wright) during this era.    Example...Roger wrote Careful With That Axe, Eugene.  Roger's bassline for the vast majority of the song, which stretched up to 15 minutes live, was simply a single note octave going back and forth.  I would say David had a LOT to do with how the song sounds, while Roger still got the writing credit."

It also proved to be their only major chart success, reaching #7 in the US and #15 in the UK.  The follow-up single, also from the album, ""The Love Parade"" was not received as well as their debut single, reaching #36 on the US Billboard Charts and only #68 on the UK charts, but still received solid radio airplay.

Haven't owned a turntable for over twenty years so haven't listened to them. As I recall Pink Floyd members performed and produced both of them. I recall the second album as being far more shambolic and far more endearing artistically but tragically because of its exposure of a person experiencing a mental health breakdown which was not something that was understood or dealt with with social ease at that time.  One should never forget, as much as I believe he is overrated in terms of his personal contribution to The Pink Floyd sound, that Roger Waters did play a part in exploring reappraisal of the post war dream that was central to Britain at that time, perhaps personally touched by the Syd Barrett experience."

It's What We Do, Sum, the Alons-y suite, Talkin' Hawkin, Surfacing, and Louder than Words all represent the band at some of their highest points. Their synergy hasn't been this good since Wish You Were Here. Rick's keyboards, synths, and pianos perfectly complement Gilmour's guitars and Mason is at the top of his form since Animals.

About the same as Lapse (with the exception of one slip and learning to fly).   Less than Division Bell.   And way less than Meddle, Dark Side, WYWH (my favorite) and Animals.   There are some highlights (don't ask me exactly which part, I am usually driving or running and not looking at the song titles)...and a few parts I like less...the part with all the drums.   I like it for what it is. An exploration of mostly Rick's ideas. I like that it is sort of low-key. I like that it doesn't have the lyrics or 'dramatacism' or whininess (to some) of Roger's writing (from parts of the Wall to now).   I didn't expect to love it frankly. I find that there is very little out there in music that I 'love' like I used to. Maybe Tedeschi Trucks but I don't think about them like I do Floyd or 71-78 Who or Stevie Ray's entire career.   I've said it in a couple of other places, I love hearing demos. I play guitar and write some music (for my own pleasure) and I love hearing the whole process brought to light. Can some of Endless River be considered a demo? Maybe, but it doesn't bother me. I like hearing more from Dave and Rick and Nick.   Maybe when it comes down to it, I like the feel or soul of the music."

I've recently developed an interest in downtempo electronica such as Four Tet, Boards of Canada, Caribou, etc., and for whatever reason I feel like this album fits alongside that genre.   ""Sum"" -> ""Skins"" is my favorite little segment of the album at the moment and I really like the ""Allons Y"" sandwich. ""It's What We Do"" was the song that did the least for me."

pinkfloyd,36k1z3,TymotheoTymothei,0,Wed May 20 10:28:11 2015 UTC,It's a contrived album with no ideas. The music recalls a lot of classic PF but there are no songs just snippets of jams. The lyrics are shit and not written by a member of the band. The cover art is astonishingly banal.   I love Pink Floyd but I cannot listen to The Endless River. I prefer to forget it even exists.

Momentary Lapse and Division Bell are great albums, Gilmour's solo stuff (On an Island) is great, and Waters put out some great solo stuff too (Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking, Amused to Death). It may not be quite what Floyd had going on in the 70s but it's all really great in its own right. But to each their own I suppose."

Nothing either did, Syd OR 'Pink Floyd', was really Pink Floyd again.""  There are only two viable options: either you think Pink Floyd died after Syd was kicked out, or you think it's all Pink Floyd. Any other reasoning is astoundingly stupid. The people who think Pink Floyd died after Roger left think they continued to be Pink Floyd after one leader was kicked out, but stopped being Pink Floyd when another leader voluntarily left. Don't like David's Pink Floyd albums? Alright. It's still Pink Floyd. Few people like With The Beatles, but it's still the fucking Beatles."

All the UK issues had the SHDW catalog number (which you can see in the link you provided), while OP's has a 1C catalog number. 1C is a German prefix. That, along with GEMA and the fact it has a socalled Label Code (LC 1305) all point towards Germany. Plus, you know, the fact that it actually says ""Made in Germany"" in the text around the edge of the label (as seen here).  So then, on the same site we navigate over to the German section instead, and find that it is listed as the German 3rd issue."

pinkfloyd,36951c,davie18,5,Sun May 17 11:20:55 2015 UTC,"There was his short lived band Stars. After what would be their last show, Syd read a rather devastating review of that show, and thought ""fuck it, Im done with this"" and that was the end of Stars. That was 1972. In 1974, someone did convince him to go into the studio again an attempt a new album. It didnt go well. And that was basically that. It didnt go very well in the making of his two first solo albums either really, but he had the rest of Floyd (minus Nick) to help him, and David famously told anyone involved with the recording of the albums that ""what happens here doesnt leave here"", referring to Syd's state. Syd was not well, mentally, and David was being protective and didnt want the ""outside world"" to know just how bad it was.  He may well have intended to record more like he said, but various circumstances (such as that Stars review) made him not so keen on it after all, and as it turned out, he wasnt capable of it anyhow."
pinkfloyd,36951c,GroovingPict,3,Sun May 17 22:55:51 2015 UTC,"This is quite accurate.  I've read a ton about Syd and this seems to be the case.    There are really a few reasons.  Obviously, the main being Syd's declining mental state.  However, Syd had always stated that he saw himself as more of a painter, and always intended on returning to that form of art full-time sooner rather than later.  He enjoyed it more, and was not a fan of the spotlight that came with being a 60's pop star.  Aside from that, Syd seems to have had a brief period in the around 71-72 when he returned to Cambridge where his mental state appeared to have ""normalized"" a bit and he was being more social.  He front-manned the band the Stars for a brief period and did a few shows, which apparently went quite well.  Working on material and general practicing as a group went well.  But as you said, the group's shows were getting bad reviews, and Syd either took it hard (he was surely still mentally fragile at this point) or simply decided he had enough.  He then went into near complete reculsion.    Apparently later in live he would still play on the guitar a bit but passion for music continued to dwindle and his focus was on his paintings."

pinkfloyd,36951c,_JackWilshere,3,Sun May 17 15:24:20 2015 UTC,"I think it was more a nervous breakdown than schizophrenia; especially considering he wasn't exactly as reclusive as is popularly said.  I also agree with Richard Wright, who believed Syd took more LSD than he wanted to.  He lived with a bunch of ""take loads of acid and you'll see the truth"" types, so it's entirely possible he was fed acid without his knowledge.  It's my understanding that he would often talk to local children and tell them stories and whatnot.  My guess is the kids didn't know who he was, so he didn't have to be on his guard and could talk to someone, and still play with words the way he always loved to without drawing heaps of attention to himself."

He frequented a pub in Chelsea Cloisters, he was a regular at the local art supply store, he often walked to the shops to get cigarettes, the paper, etc.    He wasn't in the public eye, but he hardly hid in a basement and ate pork chops, as the story goes, for the entirety of the rest of his life."

As a climax to the show the octopus was inflated and came rearing out from the lake. The moment would have been improved if a number of over-enthusiastic and mind-altered fans had not stripped off and taken to the water; in scenes reminiscent of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea, these lunatics got tangled with the air pipes and threatened to spoil the performance by thoughtlessly drowning."""

pinkfloyd,366ocy,PinkFloydBot,6,Sat May 16 18:00:22 2015 UTC,Love the remnants of Echoes in the background. I'm pretty sure a session musician played the guitar on this track as David was unsatisfied with the end product of his playing.

pinkfloyd,366ocy,MaxCHEATER64,4,Sat May 16 19:10:12 2015 UTC,"From Wikipedia  ""The second half of the song is an instrumental classical guitar solo. Interestingly, it is not widely known who played it: In several interviews, David Gilmour said that he tried to perform it, and was not satisfied with the final result (""I could play it with a leather pick but couldn't play it properly fingerstyle"").[3] Accordingly, session musician Joe DiBlasi[4] was brought in by Michael Kamen to play with the rest of the orchestra. He was ultimately wrongly credited as ""Ron DiBlasi"" on the album sleeve because Roger Waters only remembered that it was a three-letter name; Ron was the closest name he could remember to Joe when creating the record."""
pinkfloyd,366ocy,Torquemada1970,2,Sat May 16 19:32:02 2015 UTC,"Wait, he was miscredited on the album because he forgot his name?  Shows you how much Roger cared about Jon DiBlasi."

pinkfloyd,362t3w,hannibellecter,4,Fri May 15 18:47:40 2015 UTC,"The 3 greatest Kings of all. I always thought David and Freddie would have been the perfect duo to see play together. Freddie had an edge that would have sounded so fine next to David's tone.  Anyhow, this is a BB tribute. It's a sad day to be sure, but I'll be celebrating the legend rather than mourning his passing. BB King has been and forever will be. His music will be around for as long as there's a person alive to hear it. No one could command a room like he and Lucille. He could shake the rafters with his booming voice and sweep you off your feet with that tone. I have literally seen grown mature women swoon and feint at his shows. The man was tapped in to the universal groove. I thank him for the music. I'm a better person for having it in me.  I'm sure everyone already knows this tune, but I'll put it out there anyhow. David played on BB's album, Dueces Wild, back in the 90's."
pinkfloyd,362t3w,grelch,5,Fri May 15 18:59:20 2015 UTC,"I've seen him play numerous times in my life and agree wholeheartly.  Some of his shows would leave you breathless and I remember one specifically about 10 years ago after the show people were just walking around like we just all knew we just witnessed something special, even more then usual, as he was on fire that night, tearing up the stage.  I'm glad I got my son to see him a few times and even though he is/was like every other teenager (ahhh dad I don't wanna go blah blah) he was amazed and said ""When can we go again?""  BB got a new fan that night =)  Great night!  I'm sad to know I'll never see him tear up a stage and audience again but am happy that his suffering is over.

Mission accomplished!  If nothing else I got him to listen and appriecate music he might not have seen/heard elsewhere - just like my dad did for me with all the late 50's-60's music including Floyd and of course, BB King and the blues."

pinkfloyd,362t3w,grelch,2,Fri May 15 20:09:05 2015 UTC,All you can do is try.  Maybe a live show or two would get the juices flowing as I feel most live shows of just about anything are better then the records.  Something about being able to see the musicians/crowd and feel the music in a physical way as well as hearing it is a magicial combination.  Keep up the good fight brother!

Back in 2008 he surprised me with tickets to the live 8 show in London before he passed from cancer. Your story just reminded me a lot of what he did for me and my music taste. The same thing we're doing for our children. Keep on rocking my friend and long live the blues!!!

pinkfloyd,364mba,MaxCHEATER64,0,Sat May 16 12:55:52 2015 UTC,Thanks. I got it yesterday for 40$ (in Australia it seems like that's a bargain for vinyl anything) and I love it.

Because his father was killed in the war, violence tends to be his focus, and as it happens, there's plenty of violence in the Arab countries.  Also, in 'Dogs' off of the Animals album, there is the line ""I've looked over Jordan and I have seen/ things are not what they seem"". Jordan happens to be an Arab country, though the lyrics seem to be based off the lyrics from the song ""Swing Low Sweet Chariot"". The same line is repeated is Amused to Death as well.

pinkfloyd,363r69,ChaosSpeed,4,Fri May 15 21:25:58 2015 UTC,"My god I wish the solo went on... The Wall is not my favorite Floyd album but I listen to it from time to time, and being used to Pulse and David's solo live albums I always get disappointed at the end of Comfortably Numb.  I believe someday it may be released that way. I mean, Hendrix died 45 years ago and an album with unreleased material was released two years ago. There are probably loads of old Floyd related things to be released in the future."
pinkfloyd,363r69,maakuz,4,Fri May 15 21:47:24 2015 UTC,"I've wondered this as well. I think the addition of a full Show Must Go On and What Shall We Do Now would have made for a nice 'Special Edition' in the Immersion Set. On the other hand, I think we should all count ourselves lucky that Roger Waters is not like George Lucas and hasn't gone all Special Edition on the whole thing... retooling the album and removing the original from sale."
pinkfloyd,363r69,tommyball,2,Fri May 15 22:34:26 2015 UTC,The Immersion Set for The Wall was probably the closest we'll ever get. There wasn't a studio version of WSWDN but we don't know if there ever even was a studio version of the song prior to the movie.  And it's not like they'll ever go back and re-edit some of the songs to fit. Waters and Gilmour would never be able to sort out the details.

pinkfloyd,363r69,TheCheshireCody,2,Mon May 18 20:07:28 2015 UTC,The vast majority of music in the movie was re-recorded for the movie - they didn't use the master tracks from the album. I'm not sure why...probably due to editing issues.  The point is that the movie version of the song was recorded more or less as it appears on the movie. A hypothetical pre-movie master track of the song might exist in someone's basement somewhere but it's unlikely that it'll ever see the light of day.

All the more heartbreaking that it came to a grinding halt.   Lyrically and sonically, that album contained some of their most original and introspective work in years. There is both a depth and maturity there, and both their songwriting and musicianship are in full display at the pinnacle of their career.   It still feels fresh and highly listenable twenty years later (20 years!), and it's themes of communication and isolation remain as relevant now as when it was released. It's a vibrant yet melancholy record that seemed to sum up and encapsulate so many of the ideas the band identified with and was about.   I did not realize at the time that I was listening to what in essence would be their swan song, and perhaps I cherish it all the more for that reason.   ""The time is gone, the song is over.

pinkfloyd,35yslj,ComradeWalrus,1 point,Fri May 15 04:38:48 2015 UTC,"I moved to Israel recently, so kind of yes, happen to know :) Language itself is simple yet could be powerful to express. But you have to twist your brain to read it from right to left and guess words from only consonant letters because they don't write vowels. Some words even people who was born here will not read correctly at first attempt, and western surnames are usually impossible to read without mistakes (I get used to be called in different ways except the right one)"
pinkfloyd,35yslj,beardedfridge,1 point,Fri May 15 20:54:26 2015 UTC,Nice ! Did you learn the language basic before moving or you went straight in ? And does israel accept immigration from catholics ?
pinkfloyd,35yslj,ComradeWalrus,1 point,Fri May 15 20:58:58 2015 UTC,"I kind of dived into it right after moving. There was also free language courses for new immigrants. And to be honest I don't speak it well yet, kind of market level. People here are very tolerant about how you speak, after all most of them passed the same point by themselves. Most can speak english too. I do not belong to any religious confession, and immigration law is more about your heritage than religion. Israel was build by socialists and judaists, and that is a common mistake to think about this country as one with dominant religion that rule everything. There are big catholic, orthodox, islamic and etc. groups as well."

pinkfloyd,35tyz6,GusFringus,2,Thu May 14 08:02:23 2015 UTC,Glad to see somebody call AMLOR great.
pinkfloyd,35tvo1,Buttborne,2,Wed May 13 13:50:22 2015 UTC,"A fantastic song, from an album that I loved at the time of release. Even better live. I agree with David that About Face hasn't aged particularly well. Having said that, you'll be hard pressed to find a better studio band. Pino Palladino and Jeff Porcaro in the engine room and the under appreciated mostly unknow Ian Kewley on keys. The list of additional musicians used reads like a who's who of rock and roll greats."
pinkfloyd,35tvo1,grelch,2,Wed May 13 17:21:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with David that About Face hasn't aged particularly well.   Yes, and no.  I think AMLOR has aged worse than About Face -- though I agree About Face does sound a little dated too.  In some ways, though, I really like About Face because it almost sounds more similar to some of Pete Townshend's solo work (in terms of production values, and such), than it does earlier Pink Floyd (or even Dave's first s/t solo album).  That, and maybe I'm just a little nostalgic about About Face by now, almost 30 years after I first heard it (around 1988)."
pinkfloyd,35tvo1,Rooster_Ties,1 point,Thu May 14 15:10:46 2015 UTC,"It's easy to be nostalgic about. One thing our younger brethren don't understand about us greying Floydians, is the amount of work that went into hearing a new track. I'll use Murder as an example. No one knew that Gilmour had a solo album coming out, let alone that he put it out because he was essentially trying to save his career by getting his name out there. We didn't know that behind the scenes the existence of Pink Floyd was in the balance. So when on one fine afternoon, I switched the radio on  (because that's pretty much what you did) to the guitar solo outro, I immediately thought to myself ""GILMOUR!?! But what is this?!?"" You then hear that he's got a new album coming out and that they'll replay the song in 2 hours. That meant that you had to listen to the radio the rest of the day with your TDK SA tape set to record/pause just to catch it. And when the album finally got released, you'd have to make daily trips to the record store to see if they'd received it yet. And there was nothing like cracking new vinyl from the sleeve, dropping the stylus and hearing the opening strains of Until We Sleep.  As for AMLOR v About Face, production wise they sound somewhat similar to me so in essence they both sound more or less equally dated. To me About Face has some individual tracks that are the worst offenders from both albums. Love on the Air, Blue Light and probably Cruise are just too far down the 80's pop route for me to listen to anymore. I can just about bear Dogs of War if it comes on, but I can't do Love on the Air. He should have stuck it out with the song that became White City Fighting and replaced LOTA, imo."
pinkfloyd,35tvo1,grelch,2,Thu May 14 16:36:11 2015 UTC,"Love on the Air, Blue Light and probably Cruise are just too far down the 80's pop route for me to listen to anymore. I can just about bear Dogs of War if it comes on, but I can't do Love on the Air. He should have stuck it out with the song that became White City Fighting and replaced LOTA, imo.   So true!!  I always forget that there really is some real semi-cheese on About Face -- and my nostalgia for it is for the album in general (but when you get down to specific tracks, my opinions are definitely going to vary).  I'm sure I didn't hear About Face until I discovered a vinyl copy in the record library of the college radio station early on when I was a Freshman or Sophomore (around 1988).  Whether any of About Face ever got played on the AOR stations back home, I really don't know (probably did, but not much I'm sure!).  Come to think of it - I don't think I've ever heard any of it (or his s/t debut) on the radio."
pinkfloyd,35tvo1,Rooster_Ties,1 point,Thu May 14 16:44:54 2015 UTC,"I was in school in middle Ohio at the time. They had some good FM stations back then from Cleveland. They made a pretty big stink about the release of his album so I spent a lot of time waiting for Murder and probably Blue Light to come on. I remember Murder getting played quite a bit, and I remember getting infuriated all the time because either part of or all of the end solo would get cut off.   After my last reply to you, I got a wave of nostalgia and did a quick search for some of the tools of the Floyd fan trade from back then. If you wanted a bootleg or wanted to trade shows, if you didn't know someone nearby you had to hit the classifieds in Goldmine to find what you were looking for. Either that or hit the record stores down on Bleeker St. or St. Marks' place Greenwich in NYC when I was home from school. I got some amazing bootleg vinyl down there that has long since been stolen from me, unfortunately.  While I'm at it, I remember how I discovered that the Floyd were going to tour in 87. I was watching a NHL hockey game on tv. It was in Montreal. There was a break in play and the camera was showing the scoreboard in the rafters. The scoreboard  suddenly switched from the score of the game to posting upcoming events. The second or third one posted was ""Pink Floyd, September 12, 13 , 14"". And then the tv reverted to the game. I lost my shit. Did anyone see that? Am I going crazy? Floyd were done, caput back then. I didn't even know there was an album coming out and on that scoreboard they're advertising a tour date?? Couldn't be right. No internet to check. No rewind on a digital tv. No way to confirm anything but to scour the newspapers. Whippersnappers of today have no idea what you had to do back then just to get one sentence worth of information. Of course, these poor kids never got to see them live either, for which I'm sorry.  Anyhow, I've gone off on some ridiculous tangents here. Time to turn of the nostalgia and get to work.  Cheers."

I really love fretless bass in these mid-80's rock contexts."

(even though I still don't actually know what that is, I tend to just put Echoes on and just mellow out... I've spent far too long trying to figure out what Echoes is about)  But this is incredible. And it adds a different view to all these events and speeches, hearing a corresponding part of Echoes over the top and it just...I dunno, just feels more  I've been listening to Meddle like crazy as of late and Echoes has been a favourite of mine for a long time, so I'm quite happy to see someone do the song justice as well as you did.  Well done sir, I will be showing this to all of my friends that enjoy the Floyd."

(the stuff he recites after that is from The Moment of Clarity which would eventually end up on Roger's Pros and Cons album... also heard in the background, is Gary Yudman from one of the actual Wall concerts (you can hear the same speech, or one very similar to it, on the ""Is There Anybody Out There? - The Wall Live"" album)... thats not really anything to do with Your Possible Pasts, but I thought it worth mentioning while I was at it).  In addition to the three Floyd members, the song features Michael Kamen on piano, Andy Bown on Hammond, and Ray Cooper on percussion."
pinkfloyd,35qicm,GroovingPict,2,Tue May 12 19:26:03 2015 UTC,"on the final cutting bootleg, at about 4 minute on the time corrected version, it has the second line but instead of clay, has graves."
pinkfloyd,35qicm,Bimps1002,8,Tue May 12 21:30:55 2015 UTC,"One of the best songs from one of Roger's best works. ""Your Possible Pasts"" represented TFC's dynamic style the best, and is best played at a rather loud volume - a LOT of stuff is going on in this song, but most of it is relatively quiet in relation to Roger's vocals.  The transitions between slow and quiet vocals to blasting screaming with a full band behind the lyrics is definitely a strong point of this song and of this album."

pinkfloyd,35mhgy,bamojr,11,Tue May 12 15:10:07 2015 UTC,"There's really only two main variants: the North American one (pink and blue), which is so ugly I nearly feel physically ill just looking at it, and the European/UK one (brown and green). Im pretty sure a lot of the different shades/nuances in your collage is just down to different lighting conditions when taking the photos (with the exception of the MFSL release (second row, furthest to the right) which is actually the messy blurred North American version but with the green and brown colours usually found on European versions). There will be maybe slight differences in nuance between releases and countries, but that's just due to the printing process. The differences between the two main variants however are, for some to me unfathomable reason, deliberate.  I think the differences in the two main variants of the WYWH cover is more interesting: not only are they obviously different photos, but they were even taken with different cameras. The UK/European version was shot with 35mm colour transparancy, while the North American version was shot with 120mm colour film."

Compare with the UK cover which has a very clearly defined ear; you can even see skin texture and small hairs. Why on earth they decided to take that and make it a blurred out blob of mess for the North American version is beyond me."

pinkfloyd,35mhgy,BigMrKitty,8,Tue May 12 00:13:32 2015 UTC,Here are the two different covers. Don't know which is which.
pinkfloyd,35mhgy,Darth_Kyofu,4,Tue May 12 01:14:47 2015 UTC,"European version (a German one in this case, but the UK one has the same photo), and North American version.  The obvious difference youll notice immediately is that in one he is leaning forward and in the other backward. But if you study it closer you will notice more differences. Like the fact that the burning man is wearing two different suits, or that the shadows on the ground are noticably different, or that the angle in the two photos are different. All of which indicate that it wasnt simply two different photos from the same series of photos, but were in fact taken at different times of the day altogether. That and the fact that, as mentioned before, two different formats were used (35mm colour transparency and 120mm colour film).  The WYWH cover is ""famous"" for having two different versions because it is the most obvious one, but a lot of Pink Floyd (and some solo) covers differ between the North American and European version. From the exceptionally subtle (like Delicate Sound of Thunder) to the very obvious such as WYWH.  Bonus Russian WYWH cover"

pinkfloyd,35mhgy,Entopy,1 point,Tue May 12 14:22:41 2015 UTC,"I truly have no clue. You can see it on even as recent an album as ""An Introduction to Syd Barrett"", at which point one would have to think that it's deliberate, perhaps to have a certain type of collector buy both. But that was probably not the case back in the ""old days"", so your guess is as good as mine.  They went ""all out"" when it comes to different covers on The Division Bell: the North American vinyl, the North American cassette, the North American CD, the European vinyl, the European cassette, the European CD... are all different. All six of them are different from eachother."

pinkfloyd,35mhgy,pinkfloydfan4life,6,Mon May 11 18:59:55 2015 UTC,It took me two weeks to convince my girlfriend it was an ear. Even after I showed her the full photo.
pinkfloyd,35mhgy,GroovingPict,3,Mon May 11 20:50:10 2015 UTC,if it was the US cover then I can certainly understand her.

pinkfloyd,35lmdh,frientlychops,4,Mon May 11 14:44:57 2015 UTC,I just recently got the same version! It sounds quite nice actually.
pinkfloyd,35lmdh,JManSenior918,4,Mon May 11 20:59:17 2015 UTC,Ya i agree! Who let all of this rif-raff into the room about bootlegs and poor quality?
pinkfloyd,35lmdh,JManSenior918,2,Mon May 11 21:25:10 2015 UTC,No kidding! Not to mention that unlicensed reproductions can very well use the exact same plates to press out the albums.   There's a lot of these colored vinyl copies floating around that I think are quite cool. I found this and a blue translucent copy of Saucerful of Secrets at my local record shop. There was also a green copy of Ummagumma but I didn't have the money that particular day. Hopefully I'll be able to go back and snag it someday.
pinkfloyd,35lmdh,JManSenior918,3,Mon May 11 21:51:42 2015 UTC,"I know a shop in Santa Ana, CA that carries every issue of PF, bootleg and original. It is the first place that I have seen that sells Meddle and Piper at the Gates of Dawn together. They also have ummagumma, More,  a Japanese import sealed DSOTM and also sealed copies of WYWH that are original. No album sells more than $75, even the rare imports!"

pinkfloyd,35lmdh,Endxsor,1 point,Mon May 11 23:14:54 2015 UTC,"Made to look like the US print, is more accurate. This is obviously a bootleg/pirate version, and the only thing the label means on such a pressing is that thats the label design they happened to steal this time around. It was almost certainly not pressed in the US. Not that i matters; shitty sounding bootleg is shitty sounding bootleg, regardless of country of origin. (unless it's just the lighting that makes it look greenish and it's actually a regular black vinyl release?)"
pinkfloyd,35lmdh,Tiptonians,0,Mon May 11 17:01:13 2015 UTC,"Nice, I got the same one, except my vinyl is pink"
pinkfloyd,35nj3k,nutshells,3,Mon May 11 23:26:15 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty nice version, though I have to say that the Montreal 1977 version of Pigs is the best. Especially when Roger flips out at the end, starts yelling maniacally while a keyboard solo builds behind him. It's amazing. It was also the night of the infamous ""spitting incident"". Can be found on the aptly named ""who was trained not to spit on the fan"" bootleg album if you're interested."
pinkfloyd,35nj3k,DosPassos421919,2,Tue May 12 04:14:10 2015 UTC,Give the version of Dogs they did at this concert a listen too... it's amazing! Such a great concert!

KAOS came out the same year, and to me it sounds even more 80's ish than AMLOR. Revisit Radio Waves for a reminder. Basically all the major acts then fell into the 80's production trap. Clapton, Stones, Dire Straits, The Who, Springsteen, Yes etc. etc. They all dabbled in the extreme cheesiness of the 80's sound and most dressed the part too. That's just the way it was."

pinkfloyd,35mbl2,Derpy_Bird,8,Tue May 12 06:23:08 2015 UTC,"Some trivia:  Working title was ""Education"".  The child chorus are fourth-formers (ca. aged 13-14 I believe) from Islington Green School, and consisted of: Sybilla Agasee, Elisabeth Caulton, Lutfi Celul, Angela Choudhury, Alex Osmann, Liam Southwood, Virginia Swinger, David Syzyzko, and Peter Thorpe. Led by Noel Davis.  The helicopter sound is a Jet Ranger from Edwards Air Force Base, California.  The single was banned in South Africa, as it was being used as a protest song.  It was Bob Ezrin who suggested releasing it as a single, and in order to make it a hit to have it set to a disco beat (which, in case you are unfamiliar, the end product has) and to bring in the child chorus. The initial response from the band was, according to Ezrin, ""We don't do singles, so fuck you""."
pinkfloyd,35mbl2,GroovingPict,8,Mon May 11 19:19:59 2015 UTC,"I like doing a little analysis on the line ""We don't need no education.""   You hear a lot of people, especially younger people, just use this as a battle cry for their dislike of school. It's easily countered by pointing out that the line is grammatically incorrect, so clearly, they do need education.   This seems to initially counter Water's belief, and make him seem pretty dumb. However, (and this is part of Roger's great songwriting) this too can be turned back by pointing out that regardless of its incorrect grammar, you know exactly what they mean, coming full circle to his point that perhaps the kind of education kid's receive is not really effective or necessary."

pinkfloyd,35mbl2,Megalandrys,4,Sat Jul 11 21:17:00 2015 UTC,"My Thoughts: Love the scream transition.  Lyrics are very, very simple for a Pink Floyd song but the guitar solo stands out a ton because of the way it was produced.  As with many other songs, this one was usually better live with a second, different sounding guitar solo and an organ solo.    Trivia: The idea for the disco beat came likewise from Ezrin. As David Gilmour explained in 2009:  It wasn't my idea to do disco music, it was Bob's. He said to me,   ""Go to a couple of clubs and listen to what's happening with disco music,"" so I forced myself out and listened to loud, four-to-the-bar bass drums and stuff and thought, Gawd, awful! Then we went back and tried to turn one of the [song's] parts into one of those so it would be catchy.""  Of the final outcome, Roger Waters has commented:  It was great—exactly the thing I expected from a collaborator.  David Gilmour said:  And it doesn't, in the end, not sound like Pink Floyd.  Taken From Wikipedia    Notable Live Performances:   PULSE (1994)  Is There Anybody Out There? (1980)  Best edition out there imo, (has video)"

Pulse for Gilmours solo over Guy Pratt's funky slap bass and ISTAOT for Wrights amazing organ solo.

pinkfloyd,35lms7,mau5head15,9,Mon May 11 14:48:48 2015 UTC,"I can't say this is the only reason; but I think The technology just wasn't good enough to capture their sound in these giant venues, so even if the band delivered a performance they felt was great, much of it would be downgraded due to poor translation from live venues to vinyl. Of course we got the live side of Ummagumma, but their music wasn't as complex then so it would have translated better in recordings, as compared to something like Dark Side of the Moon or their subsequent albums.   Secondly, the band was trying new material during their live shows, and it could be that they didn't want their material out before it was released on a proper studio album. For instance, they played the entirety of the Dark Side of the Moon live months before the studio version was recorded, and the official album released. If they had gone and released a live album of those gigs, they would have no new material for the studio album, and would likely see a lot less sales, as there would be little reason to go out and buy an album you've more or less heard already. Part of their concerts early on were more or less trial periods for future material - there's a lot of dropped songs and instrumentals they never revisited or else reworked into something else entirely. They might not have gotten away with that if those recordings existed as officially released live LPs somewhere.   I also think that the band were perfectionists In a sort of way - they would often be overly critical of their own performing, of the acoustics in whatever venue they were playing, etc. they might have felt that recording their live performances with the intention of releasing a live album just wasn't worth it if they weren't going to be happy with the final results.   Of course the live Wall album was released in 2000 as the technology got better (better in the 80s with regards to recording equipment, and better in 2000 for mixing these sorts of things). Still, it wasn't a proper concert recording, as the audio heard in that live album is actually two concerts with the best bits of each edited together to form a single coherent whole.   I still think it's a shame there wasn't at least one or two live albums from the 70s. I always hoped that maybe they would put together an official bootleg series (like Bob Dylan has) and release that - there must be hundreds of hours of good quality audio taken from soundboards during live concerts and it would be nice to have a professional sort through them (though I must say the bootlegging community has done a fine job mixing these soundboard recordings themselves)."
pinkfloyd,35lms7,BamaDillert,3,Mon May 11 15:20:38 2015 UTC,The new material introduced in live shows is very good point. I went to see them back in '75 in september and they played Dogs which hadn't been released until '77. I think that they should've at least recorded them and maybe have just not released it yet.
pinkfloyd,35lms7,maakuz,6,Mon May 11 17:47:47 2015 UTC,"There actually is a live recording of You've Got To Be Crazy. (Dogs demo) from Wembley stadium, recorded in 1974. It was released with the Wish You Were Here immersion set. It contains Shine On, Raving and Drooling and You Got To Be Crazy. The Dark Side of the Moon immersion set also contained entire DSOTM from that same concert. They also played Echoes, which can be found online with a very interesting sax solo.

pinkfloyd,35lms7,BamaDillert,1 point,Mon May 11 22:36:54 2015 UTC,"I meant that the recording equipment wasn't all there in the 1960s and 1970s. It was much better in the 80s, especially considering Pink Floyd had more money to spend on equipment than they did before. There were a few documentaries in which Roger states that they purposefully used cheaper equipment to fill the vast venues with sound - they simply didn't have the money (or at least weren't willing to spend the money) on higher quality amplifiers and sound systems. I may have worded it a bit strangely, but I don't mean to imply that there wasn't the technology to make a good live album on vinyl - I meant the technology wasn't quite there (or too expensive to use) for the Floyd in the 60s and 70s. Whether it was on Vinyl or not is irrelevant, it's the equipment used to play the sound and to record the sound is what I meant when I refer to 'technology'."
pinkfloyd,35lms7,RegularNameWasTaken,2,Tue May 12 04:07:13 2015 UTC,"That may have been true in the early 70s, but listen to the 1974 Wembley show, that was professionally recorded and still sounds fantastic by today's standards. They could have easily done WYWH or Animals live album"

pinkfloyd,35lms7,PinkFloydJoe,3,Tue May 12 13:56:13 2015 UTC,"Well live albums didn't start to get a lot of traction until around ~1975, with albums like ""Kiss Alive!"" and ""Frampton Comes Alive!"" getting lots of airplay on the radio. Other bands like The Allman Brothers and Cream had some earlier hits that were recorded from live shows, like ""Whipping Post"" and ""Crossroads"", respectively. Also, half of Ummagumma is a live album, and that was released in 1969.   It also became much easier to record live albums as multitrack tape recorders got much smaller and more portable. In some instances, they would record shows using a ""Mobile Recording Truck"" which was basically a studio control room on wheels. It would pull up at the back of the venue and record the whole show onto multitrack Tape (later CDs)"
pinkfloyd,35lms7,dukemantee,2,Tue May 12 14:03:09 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Roger has said it had to do with their belief that a live album could not adequately replicate the concert experience. PF shows utilized quad sound and had a huge visual element. Even if they had a pro multitrack recording from one of the big mid 70s shows (which they don't) it would still be lacking. They needed to record and film a concert on 35mm but never got around to it.
pinkfloyd,35lms7,maakuz,2,Tue May 12 14:18:29 2015 UTC,"Well the original The Wall live shows seem to have been recorded on 35mm film and Roger ""has been busy editing it"", so with any luck there may be a concert film release in the future. :D"
pinkfloyd,35lms7,quantumG7,2,Mon May 11 15:33:43 2015 UTC,"Till 1977 they played all their concerts before the release of their album, instead of touring after the album was released like it's traditionally done. The songs were very rough compared to the studio versions, and sometimes wildly different. Like Raving and Drooling vs. Sheep, You Gotta Be Crazy vs. Dogs. Also some songs like A Great Gig in the Sky and On the Run hadn't even materialized till they were recording in the studio. You could say they used their live shows as testing grounds, with the songs slowly evolving as they played more and more."

I consider the sound of the voice an individual instrument, but the words spoken generally have no effect on me/my opinion of the music.  The Final Cut has too much emphasis on words, and Roger's voice doesn't do the album any justice."

pinkfloyd,35ewfe,Derpy_Bird,8,Sat May 9 20:38:14 2015 UTC,"My Thoughts: Quite unusual, but once I heard it a few times, I really started to enjoy it.    Trivia: The song was performed for the first time live on Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh tour. Gilmour and Waters shared lead vocals, although in initial performances, Gilmour sang on his own with some backing vocals by Waters. Also for the 1977 live performances, David Gilmour played his acoustic guitar parts on his Fender Stratocaster while Waters played an Ovation acoustic guitar and Snowy White played bass guitar. The live renditions of the song were complex because music had to be synchronized with the backdrop film and its sound effects. As a result, the band had to wear headphones and listen to a click-track which, in turn, meant that there was very little room left for jamming and improvisation. Pink Floyd would play the track again on its 1987/88/89 Momentary Lapse tours when Tim Renwick played lead guitar, while Gilmour played a 12-string acoustic guitar. These renditions were not synchronized to the film, which is why David Gilmour keeps looking at the screen on videos. Taken From Wikipedia    Notable Live Performances:   Animal Instincts (1977)  Brit Floyd Honorable Mention (2011)"

pinkfloyd,35ewfe,GroovingPict,2,Sat May 9 19:50:27 2015 UTC,"I think of it as a build-up, thematically creating the atmosphere that Animals lives in. Hidden in the mystic majesty that is Wish You Were Here, we start to see the origins of Animals emerge out of their history. After DSotM, they had a fucking tough time living up to it, and after having not only live-up to, but topped DSotM against all odds, they could proceed into their darkest album, and Welcome to the Machine was the narrow perilous bridge that took them there."
pinkfloyd,35ewfe,Leftieswillrule,2,Sat May 9 20:31:38 2015 UTC,"It's not super surprising, as Sheep and Dogs were written at the same time as Wish You Were Here (actually slightly before most tracks), albeit under different names (Raving and Drooling, and You've Got to Be Crazy IIRC). Waters pushed for the album to be more thematically consistent and they pushed the release of these two songs to Animals, where they were renamed and reworked when Waters wrote Pigs."

At least, that's what I assumed the headphones where for"
pinkfloyd,35ewfe,Torquemada1970,0,Tue May 12 22:57:10 2015 UTC,My all time favorite Floyd song. It NEVER fails to blow me away when I listen to it.
pinkfloyd,35ez3g,eggfaceboy,5,Sat May 9 18:25:11 2015 UTC,"They could've done it legally, but they didn't because they knew it was going to sound terrible.  They actually tried to rehearse Sheep, but they dropped it from their set because David couldn't sing it like Roger, plain and simple.  Edit: from Wiki   It was later almost a part of the setlist for the 1987–90 tour supporting the album A Momentary Lapse of Reason, but Gilmour felt like his voice couldn't reach high enough like Waters."
pinkfloyd,35ez3g,PinkFloydJoe,3,Sat May 9 19:09:40 2015 UTC,"Nothing important would happen. Pink Floyd owns those songs, so Pink Floyd can play them whenever they damn well please, Roger or no Roger."

pinkfloyd,35ez3g,pinkfloydfan4life,2,Sat May 9 21:51:37 2015 UTC,"It's one of my favorite songs. But Roger did it on his Pros & Cons tour in 1984 and it sounded dreadful. I doubt PF would have sounded that much better. Too many instruments for a live show, and the album's production is responsible for much of how great it sounds.

pinkfloyd,35ez3g,vaskark,1 point,Sun May 10 06:47:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mean TFC is more musical than Pros and Cons but I saw Pros and Cons live and it was the most boring concert I've ever been to and I've been to quite a few bad live shows.  Roger got crazy obsessed with the message, most of Amused To Death and KAOS was not him writing the music just the lyrics, he's just not a great musician, but a great lyricist and producer.  That's why Floyd worked so well, you had each member contributing their talent.  Dave has said before they put a lot of work into TFC and Pros and Cons since a lot if the songs were outtakes from The Wall ... You can hear the songs on Pros where Floyd obviously had some work, but yeah...cest la vie, Rogers live shows have gotten better, but he's like 70 now, I think its a little weird to hear him singing Sheep live, at least its not as bad as hearing Morrissey sing at 60."

pinkfloyd,35elfd,GroovingPict,1 point,Sat May 9 19:44:42 2015 UTC,Yup. The Wall had some very good radio hits that Pros and Cons wouldn't have been able to emulate.
pinkfloyd,35elfd,676339784,6,Sat May 9 17:15:21 2015 UTC,"Sexual Revolution and Pros and Cons both had potential to be radio hits. Additionally, Comfortably Numb and Young Lust were written by Gilmour and obviously weren't attached to either project. Also, Animals was a number 3 album in America and contains no radio playable songs, much less hits. I'm not really convinced by this argument."
pinkfloyd,35elfd,bowlofcantaloupe,3,Sat May 9 21:01:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think /u/inmybrokenchair has exaggerated the failure of Pink Floyd if they had released Pros and Cons instead of The Wall after rereading his comment. Pink Floyd does have a very ardent fan base, so Pink Floyd breaking up at that point isn't too likely (although if they went Pros and Cons, we would see much less input from other members which would speed up the breakup of the band)."
pinkfloyd,35elfd,676339784,1 point,Sat May 9 23:40:18 2015 UTC,"I mean, I don't necessarily that they would have broken up. Roger's increasing control over the band combined with Rick's drug problem would have eventually run its course no matter what. But I don't think the album would have been a flop. Probably somewhere around the reception of Animals, definitely better than Meddle or The Final Cut.  Also the Final Cut probably wouldn't have been made because a significant portion of that album is outtakes from The Wall. Roger would probably have fucked up The Wall without Dave's contributions and bandmates to filter out his subpar work. Pros and Cons turned out surprisingly well in certain regards."

I'm not a native English speaker and it wasn't until my earlier 20 that I learned English. When I read Time's lyric, it was like a slap in the face... I was depressive and spent my youth locked up in my room, watching the days go by. It was like the song was written for me. I cannot explain how I felt the very fist time that I actually understood what the song was about."

Used to dislike it but it has grown on me the past month or so (along with the whole album)    Trivia: Dave Gilmour in Guitar World February 1993: ""'A Saucerful of Secrets' was a very important track; it gave us our direction forward. If you take 'A Saucerful of Secrets,' 'Atom Heart Mother' and 'Echoes' - all lead logically to Dark Side of the Moon. 'A Saucerful' was inspired when Roger and Nick [Mason, Pink Floyd's drummer] began drawing weird shapes on a piece of paper. We then composed music based on the structure of the drawing.""

Such a cool riff(?).  (Is this the only song where the bands name is heard?)    Trivia: The music was written in collaboration with David Gilmour (one of three songs on The Wall for which Gilmour is credited as a co-writer), and the lyrics were written by Roger Waters. Waters provides the vocals (except for Gilmour's multitracked harmonies singing ""Run, run, run, run,""). The song features the only keyboard solo on The Wall (although on live performances, ""Young Lust"" and ""Another Brick in the Wall, Part II"" would also feature keyboard solos); after the last line of lyrics, a synthesizer solo is played over the verse sequence, in place of vocals. Following the solo, the arrangement ""empties out"" and becomes sparse, with the guitar only playing an ostinato with rhythmic echoes, and brief variations every other bar. Sound effects are used to create a sense of paranoia, with the sound of cruel laughter, running footsteps, car tyres skidding, and a loud scream. The original single version and promotional EP both contain a clean guitar intro, without the live crowd effects. Taken From Wikipedia    Notable Live Performances:   Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall: Live (1980)  PULSE (1994)"

Transposing the song down made it sound much more sinister and evil. Although Roger was probably lip syncing his parts, the vocals from him and Robbie Wyckoff are phenomenal. Doubled with the incredible visuals, it was stunning.   I never really enjoyed the album version, it feels quite empty for me, it doesn't have the life as the live versions have by either Floyd or Waters."

pinkfloyd,34vc4x,Freddies_Mercury,11,Mon May 4 21:31:18 2015 UTC,"It's a radio program. During live performances in the 70s, they would actually have a radio and tune it in to a random channel, so what you got was what happened to be live on the radio at that moment...  But thats an aside; for the album, the voices say (according to The Pink Floyd Encyclopedia):  ""...and disciplinary remains mercifully"" ""Yes, and with you, Derek, this star nonsense, now what is it?"" ""I'm sure of it""   (it doesnt seem quite right to me, but sure isnt far off at least)  I've no idea what the radio program is though; do enlighten me/us if you find out.  Oh and also a bit of Tchaikovsky's 4th Symphony can be heard."

pinkfloyd,34t7oy,pfloyd102,13,Mon May 4 13:24:19 2015 UTC,I'm gonna start off with a disclaimer: I love concept albums. I love prog. But I think The Wall suffered from a lack of subtlety and a general over-the-top theatricality. After a while I felt like I was just getting bashed over the head with the same themes again and again and again. I feel like it would have been more impactful if it wasn't a double album.
pinkfloyd,34t7oy,tanukis_parachute,7,Mon May 4 16:19:09 2015 UTC,Exactly how I feel. There are way too many words and way too many songs and musically it wasn't developed enough.

pinkfloyd,34t7oy,MiStOrHoTsHoT,3,Mon May 4 19:39:32 2015 UTC,I don't judge movie soundtracks by the same standards as a studio album. They are a different beast.
pinkfloyd,34t7oy,TheCheshireCody,19,Tue May 5 04:15:45 2015 UTC,I find the song 'Wish You Were Here' kinda boring.
pinkfloyd,34t7oy,Rooster_Ties,6,Tue May 5 06:29:29 2015 UTC,You have rustled my jimmies.

pinkfloyd,34t7oy,andres9231,5,Tue May 5 15:07:54 2015 UTC,YOU! YES YOU! STAND STILL JIMMIES!
pinkfloyd,34t7oy,TostedAlmond,10,Mon May 4 16:34:33 2015 UTC,"The problem with the song WYWH is that it doesn't stand up to repeated listening anywhere near as well as a lot of other Floyd.  It's a great song, but I only need to hear it about 1/10th as often as a whole lot of other Floyd."
pinkfloyd,34t7oy,TheCheshireCody,4,Mon May 4 20:59:13 2015 UTC,"Bingo. And yet we hear it 10x as much because it was one of their singles. The album is excellent, but I will skip over that song nearly every time I play it."
pinkfloyd,34t7oy,DudeTheBagMan,5,Mon May 4 14:30:12 2015 UTC,"Yep. The lyrics are great, but it's a dull, if pretty, song. I like the live Gilmour-era recordings where they bring in the slightly more tribal percussions and he sings along to the solo, though."

pinkfloyd,34t7oy,Endxsor,6,Mon May 4 16:49:34 2015 UTC,There's just something about Run Like Hell that almost kills the ending of the record to me. I feel like the surrounding songs have been poisoned.

pinkfloyd,34t7oy,Liu-beigel,1 point,Mon May 4 15:06:59 2015 UTC,"I forgot about this, taken from Wikipedia  'As with ""Comfortably Numb"", also from The Wall, the music to ""Run Like Hell"" has its roots in Gilmour's first solo album. ""Short and Sweet"" can be seen as this song's precursor. ""Yes,"" Gilmour told Musician magazine, ""it's a guitar with the bottom string tuned down to a D, and thrashing around on the chord shapes over a D root. Which is the same in both [songs]. [Smiling] It's part of my musical repertoire, yes."" '"

pinkfloyd,34t7oy,Endxsor,4,Mon May 4 20:44:33 2015 UTC,"I think WYWH, Animals, The Wall, and possibly even The Endless River are all better then Dark Side Of The Moon. Please don't shoot me.  Also, I think Atom Heart Mother is there best song."
pinkfloyd,34t7oy,MetatronLived,24,Tue May 5 00:44:47 2015 UTC,I think Animals is the best album.
pinkfloyd,34t7oy,MetatronLived,23,Tue May 5 00:44:04 2015 UTC,"Unpopular in general circles, but Animals is VERY popular around these parts, and among Floyd devotees.  I've claimed it as my #1 Floyd album for going on 15 years."

pinkfloyd,34t7oy,maakuz,6,Mon May 4 16:33:44 2015 UTC,Nope I think The Final Cut is more of a continuation on The Wall. It's obvious that The Wall is basically a memoir of how Roger Waters felt at the time. The Final Cut is just him expanding on that.
pinkfloyd,34t7oy,Flamov,8,Mon May 4 16:49:46 2015 UTC,The Final Cut is friggin awesome

pinkfloyd,34t7oy,josephbraun99,10,Mon May 4 18:56:52 2015 UTC,"ITT: People getting downvoted for having opinions. I just upvoted everyone even though it hurted a couple of times.  I've said this before in a similar thread. Myself, I just can not bring myself to like The Final Cut. While not Floyd's most famous album people on this subreddit keep saying that it is the album that struck them the most, I just can not relate to it. Maybe I will when I'm older.  I like Radio KAOS for example, so it's not like I dislike everything Roger has done, but god I find that album too boring."

pinkfloyd,34t7oy,yellowcarpet,18,Mon May 4 22:49:02 2015 UTC,I like the third cause it shows how insane Pink went in contrast to the first. The second I can't stand. It's so over played.
pinkfloyd,34t7oy,gm4,3,Tue May 5 01:48:26 2015 UTC,"I don't even get why. It isn't like, a step above the rest or anything. All 3 are ok on their own, but really benefit from having the rest of the album around them."
pinkfloyd,34t7oy,limprichard,3,Mon May 4 16:43:07 2015 UTC,I think because they represent Pink's progress to going insane. The first one is calm and mellow. The second one is angrier because of the teachers and his mother. The third one is down right yelling from anger because everything is just piling up. You have to have the build up or else it doesn't work.
pinkfloyd,34t7oy,halfwoodenjacket,2,Mon May 4 15:35:21 2015 UTC,This - spot on. I must add that I am a huge fan of ABITW but playing part 2 alone is incomplete without part 1 and Happiest Days of our Lives.
pinkfloyd,34t7oy,Foliagus,10,Tue May 5 12:00:42 2015 UTC,"They're good in the context of the rest of the album, but I'll never understand how part 2 became a hit."
pinkfloyd,34t7oy,gtrmu223,5,Tue May 5 15:13:48 2015 UTC,"Part 2 had the conventions of your standard pop song. Verse-Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Outro, catchy lyrics, and the disco beat. But to top it off, the school choir really made the song special. It changed from Gilmour and Waters moaning about school to a bunch of schoolchildren ""revolting"", and it became something of a symbol. It was suddenly a song anyone could sing along to.   Even Roger flipped his shit when he heard the choir version. At first he was vehemently opposed to releasing any singles from The Wall, then changed his mind after Ezrin played him the final version."
pinkfloyd,34t7oy,Blizz310,4,Mon May 4 13:50:27 2015 UTC,"I sort of agree, but Gilmour on the Gold Top might just be his best solo. I don't listen to it as much as the others but in terms of technique and difficulty that is an amazing 'wtf' type of solo, and it's also one of the cleanest, just proves what he can do without the aid of muff boxes and I'm sure that pisses people off.  edit: this sub is getting weirder and weirder with the downvotes. Used to be very rediquette, now I guess just not liking input is a downvote, and how this pissed people off I will never understand."

pinkfloyd,34t7oy,tommyjohnpauljones,24,Mon May 4 16:58:06 2015 UTC,"I've always felt that it's the culmination of Pink Floyd in a way. It's the last song on the third part of The Wall, contains lyrics written by David Gilmour and by Roger Waters, who both sing in it. It has an epic guitar solo that contains quite a bit of emotion, especially in the live versions. Nick Mason and Rick Wright weren't left out, they're utilized. And it's also the last song that they all performed together."

pinkfloyd,34t7oy,erkwxdl,5,Mon May 4 16:45:29 2015 UTC,Outro solo is one of the highest-rated of all-time

pinkfloyd,34t7oy,username1615,9,Wed May 13 00:05:47 2015 UTC,"No I agree that it's overrated: DSOTM is most people's intro to Pink Floyd.  Some people (like me) go further down the rabbit hole after that: the Syd era, Live at Pompeii, the two French film soundtracks, etc.    But some people never do: they like the ""popular"" Floyd, i.e the handful of songs in heavy rotation on classic rock radio.  These people don't even know who Syd Barrett is, had no idea they were around before 1973.    There's nothing wrong with liking DSOTM; but when a person says it is their favorite Floyd album it feels to me like a person who says ""I like anime"" but you come to find out they've only seen Akira: there is a whole world they are missing out on."

Its really good, and if that person likes it why should their fandom be predicated upon whether or not they know who Syd is?  IMO Syd should only be reserved for fans that like Pink Floyd enough to do research into the band, because beyond being a little novelty in their history Syd isn't all that impressive."

Yes, he can be a bit arrogant and intense but he just says what's on his mind. In this article he is saying that young artists that are starting right now have problems with the record companies, he is not complaining about record companies paying him too little. He even says that he is happy to be born in 1943 and not in 1983!"

The final verse of Echoes (""Cloudless every day you fall upon my waking eyes..."") could stand alone as a poem itself and the entire song was written like a Greek strophe.  Time is another contender (it isn't often for songs to be written in second person, but for poems it's a big more common).  STCFTHOTS was adapted from an ancient Chinese poem so I guess it would count.  Lesser but still relevant examples include ""If"", ""Hey You"", ""Breathe"", ""Fat Old Sun"", or ""A Pillow of Winds""."

When night comes down you lock the door The boot falls to the floor As darkness falls the waves roll by The seasons change The wind is warm.  Now wakes the owl, now sleeps the swan Behold a dream, the dream is gone  Green fields A cold rain is falling Near the golden dawn.

pinkfloyd,34r9bb,thesteezyone,1 point,Mon May 4 04:51:24 2015 UTC,"They probably played Astronomy Domine from Piper. The mixing was off sometimes when I saw them as well, so it's just that and the setlist you were disappointed in?"
pinkfloyd,34nvg9,nutshells,6,Sat May 2 21:56:34 2015 UTC,I love it more with every listen. I often wonder what it might have sounded like if they had the amount of studio time they did for their studio albums.  It makes the album even more special when you realize it was written in about 2 weeks.  Oh and the live versions Of songs Obscured by Clouds/When you're in and Childhoods End were incredible live.
pinkfloyd,34nvg9,Chrisiztopher,1 point,Sun May 3 00:55:36 2015 UTC,The two weeks thing is a very important point. I read a Floyd book (Comfortably Numb---Mark Blake) and sometimes they'd be coming up with stuff in the studio for months. Stark contrast on this one.
pinkfloyd,34nvg9,rewindcrippledrag0n,3,Sun May 3 01:34:22 2015 UTC,"Can't go wrong between Meddle and Dark Side. One of the (many) things I love about this album is that it's in that range where Wright was still contributing a lot. ""Stay"" to this day is one of my favorites. Even his instrumentation and soloing on stuff like ""Wots...Uh the Deal"" are invaluable."
pinkfloyd,34nvg9,rewindcrippledrag0n,2,Sun May 3 01:31:59 2015 UTC,Stay is great but people attribute the lyrics to Rick but like most Floyd songs it was penned by Roger. Doesn't change the fact that it's a great song though.

pinkfloyd,34r2la,damncurious,10,Sun May 3 20:43:25 2015 UTC,"Partly because of what Joe said, but there's another force in motion here.  Floyd songs (well, the ones that do this at least) aren't all about the lyrics. In some - hell, in most cases the music is equally as important as the lyrics. They're presenting you the music first because it's the 'reveal' of the song.  In songs where the music is exceptionally long compared to the lyrics (see ""Echoes"", both ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond""s, etc.), the music is more important than the lyrics, and the words themselves serve only as 'guides' for the meaning of the music.  This isn't Floyd-only, most progressive rock bands have long instrumental intros/outros even for songs that would otherwise be rather short. For examples of non-Floyd songs that do this exceptionally well, see ""2112"" by Rush, ""Starless"" by King Crimson, etc."
pinkfloyd,34r2la,MaxCHEATER64,1 point,Sun May 3 21:46:05 2015 UTC,Starless sounds like Pink Floyd until around 4:18.
pinkfloyd,34r2la,danarbok,8,Mon May 4 20:07:22 2015 UTC,"Because it builds anticipation. It's like the diagram of dramatic structure. (also known as Freytag's Pyramid)  Not all Pink Floyd songs are like that, but many follow this pattern. Think like Shine on You Crazy Diamond or Echoes. It's a build-up, climax, and then a ""deceleration"" back to reality."

pinkfloyd,34r2la,Chrisiztopher,9,Sun May 3 23:01:12 2015 UTC,Right? For most a song has to be no more than 3 minutes with the same catchy hook repeated 8 times
pinkfloyd,34r2la,Derpy_Bird,5,Sun May 3 23:03:15 2015 UTC,Because the music sometimes isn't always about the lyrics. It's about the music.
pinkfloyd,34r2la,odwulf,3,Mon May 4 02:32:38 2015 UTC,"Alongside everything that has been said about their music being about, you know: music, one of the actual reasons it's that way is that their music is rooted in improvisation and the long atmospheric pieces that so easily come out of it."

I've seen both every year since 2011 and after seeing Aussie Floyd this year I was beginning to suspect that I was simply growing tired of the Floyd cover band scene and that's why I didn't enjoy it - then I saw Brit Floyd a month ago and realized that, no, the Australians just don't put on as good a show as they used to. Brit Floyd is undeniably better, and I've decided to stop spending my money on the inferior Aussie show."

The first time I had heard this was when I was still relatively new to Pink Floyd. (I have only been listening for 3 years but 3 years straight. 365 days a year each year, but that's neither here nor there.) I was going to see Brit Floyd for the 2nd year in a row. Feeling I was highly under prepared last time, I wanted to know the songs they were going to play and fall in love with them. I went through the set-list and went on a massive jam session for weeks on end. Of course you had SOYCD, Learning to Fly, High Hopes, so on and so on. Than I hit Pigs. Holy shit man. I heard that talk box oink at the start and Rick's synth kick in and I knew I was in for a ride. Than the bass and the guitar. Than the lyrics. Roger and those lyrics man. I can't even explain how I feel about those lyrics. And the amazing talk box work by Gilmour at the solo part at around 4:18 is orgasmic in itself. After hearing this with hearing Dogs for the first time the year before, I had to listen to the hole album. Still the best song on the album IMO and my favorite Floyd album of all time. Too bad the whole band had a bad experience with it, but at least it spawned another amazing album know as The Wall."

pinkfloyd,34idyk,_wolfa,36,Fri May 1 12:31:32 2015 UTC,Dark side of the moon. Neither are bad but dark side I think is just the best album. I remember the chills when I heard eclipse and brain damage. With the wall It struck an emotional chord but I never got th e same reaction
pinkfloyd,34idyk,I_just_watched_kpop,20,Fri May 1 12:55:09 2015 UTC,"I like both a lot, but I think for me Dark Side comes out on top. Dark Side, in my view, does not have any weak points. The Wall does.  Young Lust for example (which for some to me inexplicable reason many people hold as one of their favourites from the album) is one such weak point in my view. Then again, The Wall is a double album, so it has more ""room"" or higher probability for a weak point or two.  Both are great albums though."
pinkfloyd,34idyk,GroovingPict,1 point,Fri May 1 12:45:46 2015 UTC,"It's really just as simple as me not liking it I suppose. I dont see it as a particularly good song. It doesnt fit with the musical flow or overall musical theme of the album, and even if judged as a song separate from any album, I dont like it very much. I'll take Don't Leave Me Now over Young Lust any day; that one at least serves its purpose in the story of The Wall, and is very emotional. Young Lust is to me just meaningless filler... it's the musical equivalent of a transport mission in a game or a ""main character moving/travelling to a new city"" montage in a movie :P  I feel the same about Not Now John on The Final Cut... it's the odd song out; it doesnt fit, and I dont like it even if taken out of the album context... yet, again, that is the one song that people seem to like the most from that album. So I realise I am probably the weird one."
pinkfloyd,34idyk,GroovingPict,10,Fri May 1 13:32:44 2015 UTC,"Is it really ""filler"" though? I took Young Lust as Pink wanting to find a rebound chick to get his mind off of things, only to find out it was not such a good idea going into ""One of My Turns""."
pinkfloyd,34idyk,herhigh-ness,2,Fri May 1 13:54:12 2015 UTC,The Young Lust/One Of My Turns transition is one of my favorite Floyd moments of all time. I don't understand how anyone could hate it. Young Lust breaks the dark tone of the movie temporarily almost giving you a break from all the emotions then turns INTO emotions when One Of My Turns kicks in. I LOVE it.
pinkfloyd,34idyk,MesyJesy,2,Fri May 1 14:42:07 2015 UTC,"The WAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL  I AM JUST A NEW BOYYYYAAAA  Thats my absolute favorite part of The Wall, Young Lust actually makes the album my favorite."

pinkfloyd,34idyk,MaxCHEATER64,2,Fri May 1 20:30:36 2015 UTC,"I believe people like those songs - both of them, as they have a similar sound - because they are different from the albums they are in, as you say. Young Lust gets you out of the deep philosophical, the existential weight of Empty Spaces - and what the album has been to the moment overall. The song focuses on the less existential matters of life. It's more about the dirty needs, the simple, lustful desires that are often a superficial reflection of the emptiness caused by more trascendental issues. They exist. They are more important than they seem. To me it's an important part of a concept album, specially one that tells an concrete story. It's more of a rock n roll sound... It's a part also meant to uplift, to liberate tensions or take you out for a walk before coming back to the progressive, deep existential piece that the album is being- and it's going to be. It's also part of an experimental play of changes - which you could expect in an album so long for not becoming absurdly over intensive.  I do get your point anyway. For some people it can prove dissonant or out of topic. Even for people who like it, depending on their mood when listening. It's the thing I like about Pink Floyd's music- it's made to be experienced subjectively."
pinkfloyd,34idyk,GroovingPict,2,Fri May 1 20:31:48 2015 UTC,"Young Lust absolutely served a purpose in the album.  Pay careful attention to the actual lyrics. YL was Pink showing that he was living his life in the exact opposite of what his mother wanted (for example, the contrast between ""Mother won't let anyone dirty get through"" from Mother and ""I need a dirty woman"" from Young Lust), and also advancing the narrative by showing the listener/watcher who Pink was growing up to be.   It's of particular importance in the movie, as the scene where the groupie tries to take off Pink's glasses before he leaves her is extremely symbolic of his mental state, even without the 'last brick's as expressed in the previous song."
pinkfloyd,34idyk,Chrisiztopher,0,Fri May 1 14:45:33 2015 UTC,"It's only ""necessary"" as a vehicle to drive the main character from one place to another, hence my video game and movie equivalents comparison... you know when a main character in a movie is moving to another city or whatever, and they show a montage of them driving, lots of overhead shots, city skyline shots, shots of place signs as they are passed, with often cheesy uplifting music playing in the background? They are almost always crap, but film makers feel them necessary to physically show the main character moving (rather than simply having them show up at the new place which would work just as well if you ask me, but thats another discussion)... that's how I view Young Lust. It's ""necessary"" (but not really necessary) filler to move the main character along. Both the story in the album, and the movie, could have done without it in my view.  And, even ignoring all that, I just really dont like the song. Had it at least been a good song (and I know Im in a minority in thinking it's not; Im just speaking from my own point of view here obviously) then it would have been excusable.  So for me the song is just three swings and three misses: it doesnt fit musically with the rest of the album, it isnt necessary in the narrative, and it's just not a good or enjoyable song. Three strikes... you're out, Young Lust.  I know most people reading this will disagree with most of it, but you know... that's how I see it anyway, and I realise it is highly subjective... Im not claiming any of this as objective facts."

pinkfloyd,34idyk,Torquemada1970,14,Fri May 1 14:34:48 2015 UTC,"DSOTM.  The Wall...all the best songs were written with Gilmour (including ones like Another Brick Pt. 2, even though he doesn't get a credit), but the lyrics and 'story' are the problem for me; they're so self-obsessed (and appear to boil down to ""it doesn't matter if you're a famous and mega-rich musician, you're unhappy and it's everyone else's fault"") that I've never really been able to identify with them - to the extent that I'd be embarrassed if I did."
pinkfloyd,34idyk,Snappel,10,Fri May 1 12:58:01 2015 UTC,"The whole point of The Wall is to show that it's not everyone else's fault, though. It's Pink's fault and only his fault. He is the one who erected these emotional barriers around himself and he is the one who pays dearly for that misconception later in the album."
pinkfloyd,34idyk,MesyJesy,2,Fri May 1 13:05:49 2015 UTC,"Indeed - but nobody would usually need to be told this apart from Waters - and it's not as if Waters let his wall down after this album, after all..."
pinkfloyd,34idyk,MaxCHEATER64,1 point,Fri May 1 18:24:15 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's sad that he couldn't listen to his own message, but I don't think that detracts from the album itself.  EDIT: I also think that makes the message that much stronger. It's not always easy to tear down our walls because there's a reason we erected them in the first place. It's a natural human reaction to certain events in our life to erect barriers to keep all the bad stuff in the world from hurting us. Sometimes it takes some real self-determination and dedication to truly tear down our walls and keep the communication and love open with our friends and family."
pinkfloyd,34idyk,Rooster_Ties,3,Mon May 4 17:23:17 2015 UTC,"I feel that, although while I relate more to DSOTM or Wish You Were Here Because as concept albums, they talk about innate human feelings, I like the Wall the most because its more of a Story or Rock  Opera as I have seen it been called before.  Its less about conveying feelings than it is about telling you how Pink is feeling."
pinkfloyd,34idyk,drbimbo14,2,Mon May 4 19:22:41 2015 UTC,"""it doesn't matter if you're a famous and mega-rich musician, you're unhappy and it's everyone else's fault   You seriously, seriously missed the point of The Wall.  The entire purpose of the album (most clearly expressed in ""Outside the Wall"", but in other places as well) was to show that if we only let ourselves see the dark sides of life, we'll eventually become dark ourselves - in other words, that if we choose to ignore the daily suffering of others, it will only lead to suffering for ourselves. In even simpler terms, it's saying that self-pity is more dangerous than external threats.  That's what ""The Trial"" was all about - Pink standing up and saying ""These people all did awful shit to me, but it was my fault for not seeing why they did it and how it really affected my life"".   This is why it's so immensely important to realize that Pink is the only one talking in ""The Trial"", or that he didn't actually speak to anyone else during ""Hey You"", and so on and so forth. In a way, The Wall was basically the exact opposite of Animals - it isn't Floyd saying 'life sucks, you suck, we all suck' - it's Floyd saying 'life sucks if you make it suck, but if you really pay attention you'll find that the ones who really love you are still there loving you'.  The entire second half of the album was the story of how wrong the first half was - how wrong Pink was for building the wall, how wrong he was for thinking that everyone was evil, how wrong he was for cutting himself off from society.   Pink being a rock star was irrelevant to the core theme - it just served as a really great plot point because it let the narrative play out more naturally (the ""In The Flesh"" through ""Stop"" sequence wouldn't really work if Pink was, say, a miner)."
pinkfloyd,34idyk,Rooster_Ties,11,Fri May 1 20:00:01 2015 UTC,"DSOTM by a wide margin for me.  The Wall might be a great piece of what is Musical Theatre (a sort of Rock Opera, as much so (categorically) as Tommy or Jesus Christ Superstar)...  ...but simply on musical grounds, and because of a greater universality of themes (lyrically), Dark Side is far stronger.  IMHO.    Or maybe another way of thinking of it: I could play Dark Side (for their first time ever hearing it) for a far wider variety of people (including of any/every age demographic) -- and get a greater positive response -- than I could for The Wall.  Even my nearly 90 year old father wouldn't love DSOTM, but I think he could appreciate it more than The Wall.  (Late 40's myself, FWIW.)"
pinkfloyd,34idyk,Rooster_Ties,1 point,Fri May 1 21:33:13 2015 UTC,Wouldn't the Wall make a great musical? I always thought it would.
pinkfloyd,34idyk,Outrageousclaim,1 point,Fri May 1 13:20:06 2015 UTC,"It certainly would - though I'm not sure the narrative is quite strong enough for it to be completely successful (on the basis of  narrative and storytelling).  And I think The Wall would be more easily appreciated as a sort of musical-theater piece (by the general masses), than it is simply as an album.  WHICH is why maybe the vehicle of it being a MOVIE really did make a LOT of sense (and maybe more so, even, than staging it) -- come to think of it."

pinkfloyd,34idyk,TobyCelery,4,Fri May 1 13:35:53 2015 UTC,"Mine is The Wall because I have kind of a personal connection with it. I know Waters said in the writing of the album, it was based on shows they had where people were there to get high and drink and were completely dissociated with the band so they built a physical wall between them. To me, however it strikes cords with very saddening themes of self-isolationism and feeling like no one is on your side. When I myself was in a dark place a lot of songs gave me perspective of I am not the only one feeling like complete shit, and that there are people to help. Songs like Hey You and Comfortably showcase people trying to make contact, connect, and help a person who simply needs a friend. This being said I love both albums but because Dark Side seems to be more about the folly's of a materialistic life style while The Wall is more of an emotional journey of self-hating to isolation to mental breakdown to eventual reconciliation with ones own inner demons and having been through similar is why The Wall comes out on top for me."
pinkfloyd,34idyk,GothicGroucho,4,Fri May 1 19:42:50 2015 UTC,"Without the movie, id say dark side. Both are awesome, but id have to go with dark side before the wall"
pinkfloyd,34idyk,geokeoGR,3,Fri May 1 20:19:57 2015 UTC,"DSOTM is much more open to interpretation than the wall. It's (nearly) continuous music with no clear unifying ideas. The listener gets to decide what they think it means.  With the wall, the focus is much clearer. As a result, and because it's a double album, these themes get to be explored much deeper. It tells a story, takes your hand and walks you through all of these experiences, while DSOTM leaves you to your own devices."
pinkfloyd,34idyk,ExceptionHandler,4,Fri May 1 13:08:58 2015 UTC,Depends on the day.  I love both.

pinkfloyd,34idyk,TheKooze,6,Fri May 1 12:40:54 2015 UTC,"Easily Dark Side. It doesn't have filler tracks (looking at you Bring the Boys Back Home and Stop among others) and is just a great rock album instead of Roger whining. That last sentence sounded harsh, as I love both albums, but The Wall (lyrically speaking) is Roger talking about his dead Dad, overbearing Mum, pressures of fame, etc. DSOTM is much more timeless and more relatable. Who over 25-30 can't relate to Time?"
pinkfloyd,34idyk,MisterRobertDobalina,6,Fri May 1 13:46:27 2015 UTC,"""Bring the boys back home"" is an emotional high point in the show when seen live. Talk about goosebumps. I know what you're saying though. I have to in a certain mood to listen to ""The Wall"". DSOTM fits any mood."
pinkfloyd,34idyk,Onedwa,2,Fri May 1 14:38:13 2015 UTC,The Wall is stronger in terms of its theatricality (totally get what you're saying about the 'goosebumps') -- but DSOTM is a much stronger work overall (IMHO).

pinkfloyd,34idyk,_JackWilshere,2,Fri May 1 17:35:42 2015 UTC,"Dark Side, that just manages to get into my personal PF top 5, The Wall doesn't even make it into the top 10 for me."
pinkfloyd,34idyk,Tactical_Lemon,2,Fri May 1 12:34:32 2015 UTC,I've gotta go with the wall here. It always feels so new to me every time I listen to it. I'm always picking up something else out of it.
pinkfloyd,34idyk,MaxCHEATER64,2,Fri May 1 16:36:52 2015 UTC,"Out of the two, Dark Side. It has my favorite song on it, Great Gig In The Sky...  Have you listened to Animals? I really dig that album."
pinkfloyd,34idyk,KIMrPickle,2,Fri May 1 19:48:57 2015 UTC,"Dark Side is a great movie while The Wall is a great play. Does that analogy work for you?  If not: I think DSOTM is a perfect album, while The Wall tells a coherent story without having enough standout tracks for an album that long. Also I think you have to really be in the mood for The Wall while DSOTM is a comparatively easy listen."
pinkfloyd,34idyk,Sephryne,2,Fri May 1 20:01:48 2015 UTC,"Both albums are fantastic, but comparing them is not even fair. Dark Side of the moon is the absolute zenith of Pink Floyds career, lyrics, music, theme. The Wall on the other hand, is a Roger Waters Rock Opera solo album. See the difference? I absolutely love the wall, it's story, songs, everything. But just because they are by the same band doesn't necessarily mean that they should be compared."
pinkfloyd,34idyk,KIMrPickle,2,Fri May 1 20:18:50 2015 UTC,"The Wall is a better album, but The Dark Side of the Moon is an easy listen.  With The Wall, you need a two hour window and some emotional lube. DSOTM just needs the lube."

pinkfloyd,34idyk,evilragdolls,2,Fri May 1 21:21:22 2015 UTC,"I love The Wall, it's really theatrical and tells a great story. While the Dark Side of the Moon is great, it's more a philosophical piece making the listener think instead of laying out a story."
pinkfloyd,34idyk,nemo1080,2,Sat May 2 02:05:18 2015 UTC,"The Wall. Dark Side is a classic. That's why it's at my #3 spot. The Wall is at #2 and Animals at #1. I love The Wall. I love the music. I love the lyrics. I love the story of Pink how he goes from his mother being over protective and paranoid to his teacher being abusive and acting like a dictator to his wife cheating on him and leaving him. All these events being brick in Pink's wall. Of course as most of you know, at the end he puts himself on trial and, in the words of Roger Waters, BREAKS DOWN THE FUCKING WALL!!"
pinkfloyd,34idyk,jordanlolss,5,Sat May 2 00:01:07 2015 UTC,"I would have to say The Wall. Dark side of the moon is better musically in almost every respect, but I don't get the same emotional appeal from it - it just doesn't hit me the same way The Wall does. Dark side of the moon sounds nicer and it's more refined. The Wall, however, is at least just a bit more complex in lyrics and ideas and I strongly relate to the feeling of isolation and separation. They're both extraordinarily good albums, but ultimately their very much unlike each-other."
pinkfloyd,34idyk,ViciousAffinity20,4,Sat May 2 02:04:11 2015 UTC,"I would say The Wall, but they both make me feel very emotionally fulfilled when I listen to them. I just reach for them at different times.  The Wall's theatrics definitely draw me in a little more though."

It's still a beautiful work that resonates with me, but these days - out of these two options - I lean more towards Dark Side.  Like other people have said, I feel like DSOTM has more universal appeal, and it deals more with themes that are relevant to my life now.  That being said, they are completely unlike one another - depending on the situation or my mood, I may easily choose The Wall over DSOTM.  Both are beautiful works that have granted me some of the most enlightening and emotionally-charged experiences of my life."

Those are the last they played together before they broke up in 1985 (Roger's official announcement was in 1985, even though the last album with him was in 1983... the four piece band had broken up even before that, seeing as Rick was no longer in the band for The Final Cut).  Also, strictly speaking, the last Pink Floyd show with original members wouldve been the last one with Syd, and would have been the 1968-01-20 show in Hastings, England. Featuring both David and Syd.

The cartoon character is not. Those are his eyes. Look at the multiple incarnations of the puppet; look at the many drawings by Scarfe... he is not wearing glasses, those are his actual eyes.  So either you have ""but the real life version from the movie which came out three years after the cartoon character was created has glasses"", in which case the ""the glasses are similar"" point is ridiculous because those glasses are very different from the one the Rick and Morty character is wearing; or you have the actual cartoon teacher who is not wearing glasses at all, making the statement ""they have similar glasses"" completely absurd.  Either way, they do not look the same. His (the Rick and Morty teacher) face has more in common with the procecutor than the teacher, and even then theyre not similar enough to say one was inspired by the other; theyre both just round ugly faces."

For The Final Cut, it shows both sides of war; quiet mourning but also screaming agony, Roger's own personal emotions with the mourning his father, but also his anger at politicians and the war that caused his death.  Amused To Death does it quite well too with the title track.   But on eliminating every other reason  For our sad demise  They logged the only explanation left  This species has amused itself to death   It crescendos right as he screams the name of the album, the overall message of it. Very quickly after that, he goes really quiet, back into a whisper, once the message has finally been (after many, many songs) delivered, and reflects on Bill Hubbard's original message at the start.

pinkfloyd,34ibr9,_wolfa,9,Fri May 1 12:06:40 2015 UTC,No.
pinkfloyd,34ibr9,ShaperSavant,4,Fri May 1 12:19:28 2015 UTC,"It would be a difficult point to argue. Many people view it as a musical milestone, and as the best, and most influential album of all time. It's difficult to point out any negative aspects of this album. The start, the finish, and everything in between, is essentially perfection."
pinkfloyd,34ibr9,Onedwa,2,Fri May 1 12:30:11 2015 UTC,No. Even the album art is iconic

pinkfloyd,34ibr9,AFruitDealer,2,Fri May 1 13:22:58 2015 UTC,"Perhaps in some circles.  Probably impossible to get any objective sense of the overall opinion of an album as iconic as Dark Side.  Although, to undo my very argument, I do think Sgt. Pepper is kind of overrated.  Sure, it's a really good album, and somewhat groundbreaking for its time -- but the sum of the parts (of Sgt. Pepper) is way better than if you consider all those parts (songs) individually...  ...whereas I think most of Dark Side stands up, both as a whole, and also nearly all the individual songs too (for the most part)."

pinkfloyd,34dxsn,KnowMyself,1 point,Fri May 1 00:13:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel the same way (in a way), I wouldn't see any other tribute band to be honest, but I guess it is the closest I will ever get to hearing this music live that sounds close to the real thing. Unless Gilmour gets a wild hare up his ass and calls up Roger and Nick and wants to do a final tour, which will never happen :)   or if he decides to come to the states!"

The harmonies between guitar and organs sounds really great.  And the ending is just amazing. Gilmour and Wright are supporting Waters for that last verse like true bosses.  The only deception for me in this early version is the line : 'And it's too late to loose the weight...' thats sounds sooo good on Dogs. Here its not as climatic.  Nice rap indeed. But I do understand why they cut off some of the lyrics for Dogs though !  Love this, thanks for reminding that it exists xD"

One thing I noticed a while ago, the original version of Time had the line, ""Lying supine in the sunshine, let the grass grow in your brain.""

The source for most of that section seems to go back to one book (the citations are fucked up, but I found it - it's this one).  In fact, that part of the article is directly in contradition with Wiki's own article on Richard Wright, which states ""In 1994, by which time his reinstatement in the band had become official"".  I believe that Inside Out also backs up the story of Wright being a full member of the band at that point.  I think this is probably just another case of Wiki wackiness."

He was a hired session musician on a salary on The Wall tours of 1980 and 1981 (which meant he was the only one of the four to make money off the tours), he wasnt part of The Final Cut at all, he was a hired musician for AMLoR, he was a hired musician for the 1987-89 tours. But by recording of The Division Bell, he was again a full member of the band."
pinkfloyd,34bnzu,GroovingPict,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:34:58 2015 UTC,"I read (back in the day) that he was offered a place in the band, but in order to get it he was expected to chip in with the others for the tour costs; as nobody would finance it at the time due to Roger's legal threats, they had to fund it themselves - he said no, so they agreed to have him as a salaried member.  Of course the tour did fantastically and earned them stupid amounts of money, so by the time the second tour came round he didn't need as much convincing, and so was reinstated proper in time for TDB."

This was years before I found out about weed or anything.  My most quintessential moment with Pink Floyd though was actually earlier this year.  I was sitting on a small hill by the frozen sea enjoying a J (or 2).  I had sweet wrappers between my eyes and sunglasses to help as cheap sunlight filters and so I could see better.  I was listening to the Dark Side of the Moon while enjoying an actual rare glimpse at the dark side of the Moon.  Eclipse (the event and the track) has never felt so powerful or surprisingly relevant.  I felt physically lifted as well as my heart and soul rising with the crescendo of excellence.    As the heart beat faded away the moon disappeared and I was left not quite sure what had happened.  Everything looked the same but I was different."

A friend asked me if I was going to the concert, and I replied that I didn't have any plans to and I actually said ""it's going to be a pretty boring show anyways.""  The rock gods smiled on me as my friend produced an extra ticket. He also had 1/2 a tab of acid for me. The show was absolutely incredible. My mind has never been blown like that, before or since. I devoured the PF catalog in the subsequent weeks and I never looked back."

I think hearing DSotM for the first time all the way through was the most beautiful musical experience I've ever had. Speak to Me is a great intro track, Breathe is a great song to really start the album with, On the Run is trippy and awesome, Time is just the most beautiful composition known to mankind, The Great Gig in the Sky is heartbreakingly beautiful, Money is catchy and has a fantastic solo with great lyrics, Us and Them is calm and smooth with some fantastic vocals by David Gilmour, Any Color You Like is trippy and catchy, Brain Damage has one of the best choruses ever, and Eclipse wraps up the whole thing with the best closing line(s) in all of rock and roll history: ""and everything under the sun is in tune, and the sun is eclipsed by the moon"" and also ""There is no dark side of the moon, really... Matter of fact it's all dark."". The entire album is just so coherent and has such a unique sound. It helped me get through the first year if high school and I'll never forget it."

I'll never forget that. The record also kept looping on and off but we didn't bother to try and fix it (or couldn't) so in that way it's even more of an imprint. I sort of didn't get it until then. I've listened to other records of theirs on acid as well, my other favourites were DSOTM(which pulled me out of a bad trip once, but I have no memory of that, I can explain if needed) and The Division Bell in the lysergic headpsace.  Since then some time has passed, and I don't need to do anything to get to that kind of place, it's become the opposite: whenever I listen to some Floyd, I feel bliss and I get very emotional, creative, nostalgic, even. So I don't indulge very much, it's become sort of a treat, a kind of a dessert for me. Same goes for playing (parts of) their songs on instruments, but that's quite different.  : )"

It would seem unlikely that a younger person tells an older person that he's deaf, dumb and blind, especially if that older person has just taught the younger person about the harsh realities of the world."

pinkfloyd,345uvm,GroovingPict,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:24:17 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, the ""you"" in the lyrics are the general ""you"" rather than the narrator talking to or giving advice to anyone specific. He is describing the corporate life, a life he is living, almost as if to an interviewer. So the perspective doesnt really change, in my view; this can all be part of the same ""conversation"" with my recently invented imaginary interviewer for example, or part of the same rambling to no one in particular. The last bit though (the several who wases) is obviously not part of that same monologue, but feels sort of ""zoomed out"" somehow, as if spoken by an outside observer who isnt necessarily a Dog.  I dont think the change of singers is significant here. They sometimes do it to create a dialogue (CN, where Roger represents one person and David is the main character replying), but sometimes it's just out of necessity or to create a specific mood (Hey You... you cant easily imagine David singing Roger's parts in that one (or vice versa for that matter) without it being quite a different song, atmosphere-wise).

The lyrics from ""Pigs on the Wing (Part 2)"" make me think this -- ""I don't feel alone/On the weight of the stone/Now that I've found somewhere safe/To bury my bone/And any fool knows a dog needs a home.""  The first couple of verses of ""Dogs"", however, are sung by David. When Roger starts to sing, it becomes first person. In the next verse, the perspective changes back to third person, and I think it might just be the Dog saying what you've got to do to make it as a Dog. But it's still from a Dog's perspective."

pinkfloyd,34424w,noel_105,0,Tue Apr 28 03:38:33 2015 UTC,I thought is was ironic that he's making a 5.1 mix but is saying that you only need two speakers.
pinkfloyd,34424w,noel_105,11,Tue Apr 28 03:43:43 2015 UTC,"Well he's making a 5.1 mix, but he's also releasing a QSound mix, which relies on two speakers to create a 3D effect. That's what he was talking about when he said you should sit between the two speakers."
pinkfloyd,34424w,noel_105,2,Tue Apr 28 04:12:25 2015 UTC,"Aw damn, I was hoping for both. Either way, I'm quite sure he's referring to the stereo version in that sentence."

Did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter when the promise of a brave new world unfurled beneath a clear blue sky?... The flames are all long gone but the pain lingers on. Goodbye, blue sky.

I'm not really sure if whatever is playing on the TV in The Wall is particularly important, I've always found it to simply be for the sake of atmosphere, make you feel as if you're in the hotel room with Pink, though there might be some meaning with some of the programming. Fun fact though, one actor recognized his voice from a movie or program and he, ""accepted a financial settlement from the group in lieu of legal action against them (them being Pink Floyd of course).""   Apologies for not being very coherent, final exams are taking their toll on me, and it's almost 3 AM!"

pinkfloyd,33ztc0,Chrisiztopher,1 point,Mon Apr 27 10:51:49 2015 UTC,"On The Wall it's mostly one movie. That movie is ""The Dam Breakers"", a WWII documentary about soldiers who would burst German dams in order to give the Germans a strategic disadvantage.  And if you notice, it's played on very specific places. The first time you hear it clearly is on ""One of My Turns"", where Pink's own dam is about to burst. Then you hear it on ""Nobody's Home"" - the movie explains this WAY better than the album could. Basically he's watching it because it reminds him of his own backstory, and for that he hates it, and tries to change the channel but there's nothing else good on (this is the opening to the film version of ""Nobody's Home"")."
pinkfloyd,33ztc0,MaxCHEATER64,2,Mon Apr 27 10:30:14 2015 UTC,"The Dam Breakers is in the movie, Gomer Pyle is in the studio version. The Dam Breakers fits it better so I don't know why they didn't use it in both."

pinkfloyd,33xngj,Rooster_Ties,3,Sun Apr 26 20:28:36 2015 UTC,"The Last Few Bricks is actually maybe my favorite piece related to The Wall.  There were a few live versions where, because of the needs of the stage-hands to finish assembling the wall, the tune went on close to 12-13 minutes."
pinkfloyd,33xngj,Rooster_Ties,7,Sun Apr 26 18:58:30 2015 UTC,"Well, Wish You Were Here could have included the entire Shine On suite as one continuous piece, had there not been LP-side length restrictions."
pinkfloyd,33xngj,BamaDillert,11,Sun Apr 26 18:33:52 2015 UTC,"I thought it was an argument between Roger and David about that - Roger wanted to bookend the album with the SOYCD as we know it today, and David wanted it to be a continuous piece like echoes. I don't think it was a matter of vinyl restrictions which led to their ultimate decision."
pinkfloyd,33xngj,Rooster_Ties,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:43:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, something like that.  I forget the particulars, but having the entire suite run close to 30 minutes just wasn't going to work for vinyl, so that influenced how they developed the album, and the inclusion of the other pieces."
pinkfloyd,33xngj,Kshaard,5,Sun Apr 26 18:46:39 2015 UTC,"Well, a 26-minute side had become relatively normal by 1975. In fact, AHM side two was just over 28 minutes long, so there isn't much of a problem with putting SOYCD on one side of vinyl."
pinkfloyd,33xngj,Rooster_Ties,2,Sun Apr 26 18:49:56 2015 UTC,"If I remember right, at the time, they were envisioning the complete Shine On suite lasting as much as 30 minutes (or even slightly longer).  I don't have a source on that, I'm afraid, so it may just be apocryphal - but I think I have heard that a few times over the last 20 years."

pinkfloyd,33xngj,MaxCHEATER64,2,Mon Apr 27 13:10:09 2015 UTC,"If you get rid of the lengthy outro on Part IV and intro on Part V, SOYCD would likely fit on a single side. It being a bookend was more of a stylistic choice.  The real deal with WYWH was that it was originally a double album - the first half being WYWH with long ends and a short middle, and the second half having a long middle with short ends, which eventually became Animals."
pinkfloyd,33xngj,RandomPrecision1,1 point,Sun Apr 26 20:33:35 2015 UTC,"Huh, I don't think I've ever heard that it was really meant to be a double album.  Or I guess, I didn't think they ever meant to have all of those songs on the same album.  The narrative I remember is that they had Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Raving and Drooling, and You've Gotta Be Crazy all floating around in some form - then when they started working on SOYCD for the next album, they realized the other two songs wouldn't ""fit"" with their Syd-centered album."
pinkfloyd,33xngj,RandomPrecision1,5,Sun Apr 26 23:29:30 2015 UTC,I think that The Division Bell might have been quite longer with some of The Endless River tracks incorporated but with vocals.
pinkfloyd,33xngj,GroovingPict,5,Sun Apr 26 17:45:58 2015 UTC,"The Division Bell was already released with the CD in mind, was it not?  The album is longer than what would fit on a single vinyl, so the LP version has to cut down some of the songs.  My digital version is about 66 minutes long - a single vinyl usually holds about 43 at max."

pinkfloyd,33xngj,extraflux,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:30:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly, The Division Bell was tailored for the CD and not vinyl. As you say, the original 1LP vinyl release was heavily shortened. So I guess in a way it has suffered the most from ""vinyl restrictions"" in that the original vinyl version was indeed an amputated form of the album compared to the CD release."
pinkfloyd,33xngj,RandomPrecision1,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:15:20 2015 UTC,"That's fair enough.  I guess the way that I thought of it is that The Division Bell is one of the only Floyd albums where I don't think of the vinyl as the definitive version, so I don't think of the album as being limited by the medium at all.  But when you're just comparing the vinyl of one record to another, that's an excellent point.  Edit: I guess something else I meant in my original response is that I don't think we would've seen more jams that ended up on The Endless River - the vinyl version was already chopped down, and TDB was already a bit less than a full audio CD (it's been a while, but I think those could go up to ~80 minutes)."

pinkfloyd,33xngj,MaxCHEATER64,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:22:48 2015 UTC,"Vinyl is capable of holding up to 53-54 minutes, though.  Take for instance Genesis' Selling England by the Pound."
pinkfloyd,33xngj,maakuz,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:20:16 2015 UTC,"That's true, but you lose some dynamic range by making it too long though.  I think the nominal amount that a 33⅓ can hold is 20-something minutes per side.  You can go above that traditional maximum, but then you can't cut the groove as deeply, so the mastering ends up being more squished/compressed."
pinkfloyd,33xngj,Kshaard,1 point,Sun Apr 26 23:12:00 2015 UTC,"Like Wish You Were Here, The Division Bell was originally planned to be a double album, with the first half being what would eventually (and I do mean eventually) be known as TER (in WYWH, the second half was spun off into Animals).  It was dropped due to time constraints rather than length restraints - TDB wasn't a double album, even with its song count."
pinkfloyd,33xngj,MaxCHEATER64,2,Sun Apr 26 20:30:10 2015 UTC,"As Max said, The Wall.   The Division Bell original vinyl release had a couple of parts shortened so it would fit, I listened to it once and well, it just feels wrong."
pinkfloyd,33xngj,maakuz,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:46:21 2015 UTC,I don't know why they didn't just put the Division Bell on two separate records (which would lead to better sound quality as well...)
pinkfloyd,33xngj,UsNotThem,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:55:18 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer, and it's also why Amused to Death and On an Island didn't have serious vinyl releases at their debut - there was nobody to buy them."

He really should have released that record  as a double album, then it would've had a much more coherent story line."
pinkfloyd,33xngj,TheSeabass16,1 point,Sun Apr 26 19:05:04 2015 UTC,"K.A.O.S would have been much better if he had actually taken the concept and ran with it instead of writing two-minute long skits and then surrounding them with filler.  An entire album's worth of ""Who Needs Information"" would be perfect...sadly, that isn't what we got..."
pinkfloyd,33xngj,Torquemada1970,1 point,Sun Apr 26 19:29:51 2015 UTC,Interstellar Overdrive could go on for hours when they played it live in the '60s so I guess that track could be improved but I wouldn't say Piper suffers from having an overly short Interstellar Overdrive.

My tastes at least for the past few years were generally heavier, metal sort of prog.   I get into this band Shadow Gallery, and this song Floydian Memories comes on while I'm listening on shuffle during a bus journey. Gotta say, I absolutely love it, it is the gateway into Pink Floyd for me."

pinkfloyd,33yly1,TinyTesticleSalesman,2,Mon Apr 27 02:22:50 2015 UTC,"You need a crossfader. It blends the tracks together when they switch:  Setting up Crossfading  On the iTunes main screen, click the Edit menu tab and choose Preferences. Click on the Playback tab to see the option for crossfading. Now, put a check in the box next to the Crossfade Songs option. You can use the sliderbar to adjust the number of seconds that crossfading should occur between songs; the default is 6 seconds. When done, click the OK button to exit the preferences menu.  Testing Crossfading Between Songs  To check that the duration of crossfading between songs is acceptable, you need to hear the end of one song and the beginning of the next one. To do this, you can simply play one of your existing playlists. Alternatively, click on the Music icon in the left pane (underneath Library) and double-click on a song in the song list. To hurry things along a little, you can skip most of the song by clicking near to the end of the progress bar. If you hear the song slowly fading out and the next one fading in then you've successfully configured iTunes."

Refrained and just the slightest bit nasty I have to admit though, since it was a Les Paul tribute show with the man himself leading the band, I would have thought it more appropriate for David to bust out his gold top Les Paul rather than the strat. Still, this is good stuff. To bad the exchange between David and Les Paul got cut off at the end, where Leas say""....boy, you play your butt off"" and David ends up patting him on the head Benny Hill style. (found a much more low res version that includes the beginning and end)  Anyhow, it's worth watching the whole show. There's some great jamming throughout from BB King, Eddie Van Halen, Brian Setzer and others.

pinkfloyd,33r2dc,a3poify,6,Fri Apr 24 20:31:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think you mean to use 'overbearing'. Maybe overarching? Anyway, here's how I see it:  Piper At the Gates of Dawn: No distinct theme; the songs are almost all 'childish' in a sort of way, or have a certain innocence or naivety in them, but that just might be Syd's songwriting - his solo albums are almost the same way.  Saucerful of Secrets: No distinct theme, plays around with themes of war; mostly just seems like an attempt to pitch themselves even further as a psychadellic rock band.   Ummagumma: I've never listened to the full thing, don't know.  Atom Heart Mother: Listened to the whole thing many times. I don't know what kind of theme they were going for here. The songs all seem to be unrelated. Maybe it's about breakfast.  Meddle: Again, none of the albums up to this point have been concept albums, so none deal with the same themes throughout the entirety of the album. Echoes, though, is supposedly about sympathy and the capacity to see yourself in other people. 'One of These Days' is a ""poignant reprisal of the contemporary social situation"" as described by Roger Waters. I believe 'Seamus' is about a dog, but I've yet to crack that enigma.   The Dark Side of the Moon:It's been described as a recipe for insanity. The things sung about are all things which drive the modern man insane: that is not having enough time to do things, worrying about money, about death, always being on the run, and conflict (or violence) which all ultimately end up driving man insane. The ending song is about how humanity shares these traits, a continued motif of sympathy carried over from Echoes, on Meddle. Of course, this being a concept album, it has a unified theme.   Wish You Were Here: It's about absence as stated many times before.  Animals: I think it's very political as you said, and mostly against Capitalism. Borrows its imagery of the pigs, dogs, sheep from George Orwell's animal farm. The wikipedia page says it's also a response to the punk rock movement; the musicians involved in that movement (notably Johnny Rotten, who wore the famous 'I hate Pink Floyd' t-shirt) despised classic rock, which Pink Floyd were starting to tend towards.   The Wall: It's about isolation. Basically Roger Water's diary but in musical format. Deals with solitude and alienation. Emotional disconnects - between Pink and his father, between Pink and his lover, between Pink and the audience. Also deals largely with self-judgment. There's a lot of introspection going on, notably during the Trial segment.  The Final Cut: Very much an anti-war album, speaks directly against the major instigators of the Falklands war: Margaret Thatcher and friends. It is told through the perspective of the teacher from the wall, so it doesn't really involve the Pink character.   And I haven't had the heart to listen to the 'newer' albums fully, so that's about all I can muster. A lot of the albums aren't explicitly concept albums, so you would have a difficult time trying to find a unified or single theme. Also, the Wikipedia pages of the concept albums has some good info about the thematic elements in each."

I always think of Sysyphus as a soundtrack to a horror film perhaps, and Grantchester Meadows as a calming ""chill"" song (the lyrics are great too.) Several Species... just accepted as an abstract/avant garde peice and that's that... The Narrow way is my favorite on the album, Gilmours lyrics are great here. And The Grand Vizier's Garden Party is a great percussion experiment. Its very understandable lots of people dont like it, this is just the band exploring and experimenting to find their sound"

pinkfloyd,33nvfo,NachoFresard,31,Fri Apr 24 01:26:37 2015 UTC,"You're wrong on at least one point - DSOTM definitely does have a 'solution'. It's easy to miss, but it's there. The final two lyrical lines in the album:   And everything under the sun is in tune  But the sun is eclipsed by the moon   The Dark Side of the Moon is a brilliant album, and the way it shows how people can be torn apart by various facets of modern life is really quite stunning on an emotional level.  Everything you, or any one else, will ever experience will eventually be lost to history. Knowing that, why would you want to dwell on how hard it is to get there? Sure you may not have all the time in the world, but the universe certainly does, so why should it bother you? Hidden somewhere beneath the synthetics of Any Color You Like, the echoes of Us and Them, and the clocks of Time is a message much deeper than any of them apart.  To quote Breathe, ""Balanced on the biggest wave/You race towards an early grave"". DSOTM tells a single, unified story - a warning, really. A warning that if you take life too seriously, or not seriously enough, you'll go insane. ""Time"" is, despite its daunting nature, just one stepping stone on that path - just one chapter in that story.  Maybe you won't get it today...in fact, I'd be surprised if you did. It takes most people decades to come to the same conclusions that ""Breathe"" and ""Eclipse"" warn of. Some people never do. The best you can hope for in the meantime is to follow your own footsteps, and just keep breathing."

pinkfloyd,33nvfo,MaxCHEATER64,9,Mon Apr 27 09:52:22 2015 UTC,"This might sound cheesy, but this song reminds me to make the best out of life. Since we do eventually die and disappear, we might as well make the ride enjoyable.  The beginning of the song discusses someone who is wasting their life by not doing anything, ""You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way"". This also may include stress and anxiety that prevents one from enjoying life.   The song then transitions and talks about someone who realizes that they've been living their life all wrong by doing nothing while constantly worrying and stressing. However, they are too late to fix it, ""So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking"". This is the person you want to avoid becoming.  Realize now, especially while you're still young, that life should be enjoyable. Don't waste it doing nothing or constantly worrying. Look at things in a positive way, challenge yourself, try new things, go explore new places, meet new people, do whatever it takes to make sure life was worth living. Do all these things before it is too late. Also, think about the beautiful things in life, like nature, music, opportunity, etc.  I am a teenager as well, and this song has always reminded me to make life enjoyable. I do what makes me happy because in the end, having a good life is all that matters. Don't let the song destroy you, but let it help you, as it was intended to do. I hope that I've helped in some way or another, and I wish you the best."

pinkfloyd,33nvfo,Be-seeing_you,2,Thu Apr 30 18:34:10 2015 UTC,"You know what's strange? I've recently been listening to Time a lot and thinking along the same lines. How quickly time flies, how little opportunity we have to make a difference, how if you look away, your life can pass you by. That's why we have to make the most of each day. Also, the poem Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night is essentially the same message.   Have you listened to Darkside, the radio play by Tom Stoppard? Its section on Time (it was written to go with Dark Side of the Moon) and really a lot of the plot are sort of uplifting when it comes to this question. Give it a listen.  I hope you find something to cling to and that you live life to the fullest. Rage, rage, against the dying of the light."

It likely won't be several hundred dates like The Wall, but it'll hit most of the major cities. If Gilmour's recent tours are any indication, it's pretty unlikely he'll ever do a worldwide tour again.  I've seen Rog three times now (the third was the In The Flesh tour) and Pink Floyd twice on the Division Bell tour, including the first show on that tour where they played Dark Side in its entirety. That was awesome - they played a bunch of songs, did an intermission, and during the intermission you gradually heard a heartbeat, veeeeeery faintly but veeeeeery slowly increasing in volume. I thought it was because I was extraordinarily baked, until the band re-took the stage."

pinkfloyd,33hk2k,InMyBrokenChair,6,Wed Apr 22 18:46:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah... I'm pretty sure it's just a concert.  If you want to get mad at him for anything, it should be that his biggest problem with Pink Floyd after he left was that they didn't ""get"" The Wall, playing certain songs from that album in large arenas. Roger said The Wall was an ""attack on Stadium Rock- and there's 'Pink Floyd' making money out of it by playing it in stadiums! They made a live video of one of their shows a few years ago, and I thought it was really awful. It became obvious to me that they never understood any of it at all. And neither did quite a large number of the great unwashed -- as long as there are lots of lights going off, and they can recognize the tunes, they're relatively happy."" He also said, ""Rock 'n' roll in stadiums is genuinely awful. These concerts are just like Tupperware parties... with 50,000 people, only they don't buy Tupperware, they buy hot dogs and T-shirts and occasionally look up to watch those disgusting video screens that are all out of sync and make you feel sick and torture you.  It's funny how people try to work their way around the greed of it all.  Like U2 whose rationale is 'Ooh, we have to play in stadiums 'cos all our fans want to come and see us'.  Well, fine; give your fans a really shitty show in a stadium - but for fuck's sake don't charge them 25 quid for it!""  Sixteen years later, Roger charged 150 quid to see a stadium show dedicated to The Wall."

pinkfloyd,33ib1j,colin_creevey,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:12:07 2015 UTC,"I really like the energy of the live album, but I feel it doesn't convey the emotion of the Wall very well, what with the audience yelling and screaming during the quieter, introspective parts like nobody home or is there anybody out there. I also don't really like the version of Comfortably numb on the Live version - can't quantify it, just prefer the studio version for its polish."

pinkfloyd,33h0q0,InMyBrokenChair,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:15:44 2015 UTC,"Actually, it was like that from the beginning. The US cover was taken just before/after the UK cover, so they're only slightly different. The UK cover had the four lights, while the US one didn't. The cover they used as the main one for TDB20 (and the flair here) was the original Asian and mainland European version, if I recall corectly. That's my least favorite one because the only cloud in the sky looks like it's popping out of the right head.  Then there's the stone one. I'm not sure if it was ever meant to be the main cover, but it was used in the inner booklet of all versions.  My favorite is the UK version.  Edit:Wait... I forgot the version with the flags. I have no idea what that was for."

pinkfloyd,33h0q0,GroovingPict,2,Fri Apr 24 16:59:12 2015 UTC,"Like in many of the albums, the cover art differs between the European and North American releases. Quite why that is, I do not know, but for some reason, different shots were used (in fact, if you go by the shadow on the ground, they were even taken at different parts of the day, so it's not even two shots from the same series of shots; theyre from two different series).  A long time ago, I made a post on a different sub detailing the vast amount of subtle difference between the North American and European covers for A Nice Pair. There is some difference in nearly every single of the little pictures that make up the front-, back-, and inside covers. Many of them being just different cropping of the same photos, but some also different photos altogether. Again, why? who knows.  For shits and giggles, here is a rundown of differences in cover art for Floyd related releases (excluding A Nice Pair; youll just have to search out my previous post on that one):   The Piper at the Gates of Dawn: Actually no notable difference on this one as far as I have seen. Though I might as well throw in the Italian version, as they went with a completely different design altogether. As you can tell by the picture, Piper was not released in Italy until the early 70s, which is probably why they wanted to use a picture featuring Gilmour rather than the original one with Barrett. A Saucerful of Secrets. Already on the second album you can see a clear difference in the cover arts. The image for the US version is much clearer than the UK version which is much more messy. In the US version you can see Dr. Strange clearly, while in the UK version he is nearly completely obscured. Notice also that the UK version has more of the green vase thingies at the bottom (and tighter together) compared to the US version. I'll bring up the back cover too (US and UK), because even though the design there is really the same, again you can see the US version is much clearer. In the UK version it is just a dark mess, while in the US version it is nice and clear and you can see details from all the photos that are blended together. This is probably the only instance where, in my opinion, the US version is actually better than the UK version (rather than worse or neutral). More. The only difference here is the style and placement of the title. US version, UK version. Ummagumma. Not much of a difference here either, the only one being that the GiGi album cover leaning against the wall is blanked out in the US version (a quick sidenote to clear up what seems to be a common misconception: all US versions have it blanked out, and all UK versions have it intact. It seems some people think that the earlier US issues had it intact and/or that later UK issues had it censored and thus if you find one with it intact youve found some sort of holy grail; this is not the case at all). US version (later US issues also have the Special Buy text printed on the cover), UK version. I'm including also the Australian version as they apparently werent content to simply blank out the cover, but airbrushed it away completely. Atom Heart Mother. No difference at all for the original releases, but later US versions include the title printed on the cover, which the UK versions never did. Meddle. Good God is the US version of this ugly. In the UK version you can clearly see it is an ear, with hair and skin texture and all, while on the US version it is just a faded featureless nothing. What on earth was the thinking behind that choice I wonder. Also the colours are different: green and brown for the UK and pink and blue for the US. Obscured by Clouds. While the two uses the same image for the front cover, I would still say they are different design choices. The US version is intensely bright, while the UK version is more subdued. Also the rounded corners thing on the UK cover. This difference in brightness btw is not due to these two images here being scanned differently or whatever; I own both versions and the difference is real. The brightened US version actually makes the image less clear and blurs out some detail present in the UK version. A strange thing to say perhaps for a cover intentionally blurred/obscured. Still, a minor difference. The bigger difference is found on the back covers, as they feature different photos/stills from the movie. US version, UK version. As you can see, both covers feature a ""mountain picture"", a ""riding horses"" picture, and a ""white girl surrounded by natives"" picture, but they are not the same pictures and they are in different order. Dark Side of the Moon. The difference here is not on the cover itself, but rather on the inserts. As most of you will know, this album came with two stickers and two posters inserted. While the stickers are mostly identical, the posters are quite different. The pyramid poster: the US version is green and the pyramids seen from a distance, compared with the UK version which is blue and much more up close to the pyramids. Also the pyramids are seen from opposite sides in the two. The group poster: US version, UK version. The most obvious difference is that the US one is portrait oriented while the UK one is landscape oriented. Also the photos are all different; all the small ones and the large background one. Wish You Were Here. UK version (actually that particular image is of the German issue, but it's the same), US version. Again, note the shadows in the two images, and also the angle of the photos. And, looking at it now I also notice the burning man is wearing two different suits in the two photos. The two are not just different photos, but from different series of photos. Which means that poor guy was lit on fire at least twice :P But there are actually more differences to be found in the packaging for WYWH. Both US and UK versions included a postcard of a diving man. But, surprise surprise, different photos again. US version, UK version (that particular image is from the Quad release). Animals. The only difference here, as far as I have been able to tell, is that a couple of the small photos on the inside cover are cropped slightly differently, but thats barely worth mentioning. The Wall. No differences. The Final Cut. No differences. A Momentary Lapse of Reason. The man is holding a mirror in the US version and breaking a twig in the UK version. Delicate Sound of Thunder. Really? The birds? You had to make the birds different? why? To elaborate, the images are so very near identical I nearly missed it. It's the bloody birds. Here, take a look: US version, UK version. Now, some of the birds are different in the two, but taken in rapid succession it seems (notice the top bird for example). But then again, some other birds are absolutely identical, which I guess means that at least one of them, possibly both, are composite photos. Why?!   Seems this post is about to be too long, so Im posting the rest in a reply to this comment."
pinkfloyd,33h0q0,GroovingPict,2,Sat Apr 25 03:36:41 2015 UTC,"And the rest:   The Division Bell. This one is a lot more obvious. So obvious I dont even feel the need to find a high res version of the UK cover. US version, UK version. The sky is obviously all different. Taken at different times of day or possibly different days altogether. Lights in the mouth. It doesnt stop there though. US cassette version, UK cassette version. They both differ from the vinyl versions in that they both feature the stone faces rather than metal faces, but again the two even differ from eachother. The sky is different and again there are the lights in the mouth. And the background is different, because fuck it why not. Notice also the ""Cluster One"" picture in the foldout. But wait, there's more. US CD version, UK CD version (surely they are just fucking with us by now). They use the metal heads, but they differ from the vinyl covers. And again they differ from eachother. Pulse. I dont think there are differences here, but I didnt check every single piece of the packaging. The Endless River. No differences I think.   Compilations and solo releases (just the ones with differences):   Relics. UK version (here the title is filled in with pink, which originally it wasnt), US version, Australian version. I'll leave it to you to discover the subtle differences between the three on your own ;) Syd Barrett (The Madcap Laughs / Barrett double album compilation). UK version, US version. The name and titles are written differently. Also the items on top of the photo are different and arranged slightly differently. Syd Barrett - An Introduction to Syd Barrett. EU version, US version. Some obvious deliberate differences here: placement of orange, presence/absence of apples, presence/absence of a dragon of all things, number of planes visible."

pinkfloyd,33dnz2,PinkFloydBot,16,Tue Apr 21 18:00:15 2015 UTC,"My Thoughts: Great song and deserves all the praise it receives.  Not many others like it regarding the intro and overall theme.    Trivia: The radio was recorded from Gilmour's car radio. He performed the intro on a twelve-string guitar, processed to sound like it was playing through a car AM radio, and then overdubbed a fuller-sounding acoustic guitar solo. This passage was mixed to sound as though the guitarist were sitting in a car, listening to the radio; it also contains a whine that slowly changes pitch—emulating the electro-magnetic interference from the engine of a car as it accelerates and decelerates. The master tape of the original recording includes an entire performance of pedal steel guitar, played by David Gilmour, that was not used in the final mix. Taken From Wikipedia  Another thing I wanted to note that is a bit more well known is that after recording, Gilmour heard himself coughing and that urged him to quit smoking.    Notable Live Performances:   Alternate Version with Stephane Grappelli on violin (1975) Studio  Live 8 (2005)  Animal Instincts - Oakland (1977)  This one is particularly awesome because of the segway from Have a Cigar (Nick tunes an actual radio here)  P.U.L.S.E. (1994)"

I like to think that the two songs run in parallel, sort of opposite sides of the same situation; Wish You Were Here from the person longing for reunion with a lost friend, and Summer '68 from the lost friend dreaming about the days he used to spend with his old friends. At least, that's what I see. It's probably wrong."

I desperately want the last sentence of that line to be ""Wish you were heres."" That S at the end of ""here"" makes all the difference in the world to me."
pinkfloyd,33dnz2,PinkFloydJoe,12,Tue Apr 21 18:39:07 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying, but if we were going to change a lyric it would probably be ""What have we found? The same old fear, Wish You Were Here"". Since that is the name of the song & album, it would be best to replace ""fears"" with ""fear"" instead of ""here"" with ""heres"".  I think the lyrics are fine without the change though."
pinkfloyd,33dnz2,lemiskewl,-3,Tue Apr 21 18:50:27 2015 UTC,"That doesn't reflect what the song means to me as well as wish you were heres.

pinkfloyd,33dnz2,MaxCHEATER64,17,Tue Apr 21 21:16:37 2015 UTC,"Well the problem is that ""heres"" isn't an actual word."

pinkfloyd,33bddu,InMyBrokenChair,3,Tue Apr 21 03:26:18 2015 UTC,"If that's real, it's an okay setlist. The average fan probably wants a lot of Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, and The Wall, but this contains most of what any fan would really want.  In order to please everybody, they needed to do: 1. At least one Syd song (they do See Emily Play) 2. At least two songs from 1968-72 (they do Set The Controls and One Of These Days) 3. A bunch from the aforementioned three albums (obviously done) 4. At least one from Animals (they do Sheep) 5. At least one from each of the last four albums (they do The Final Cut, On The Turning Away, Keep Talking, and Louder Than Words)  So they really do all they need to. I saw them before The Endless River and they did more diverse stuff (at least one song from every album except More and Ummagumma), but there's nothing wrong with this setlist."
pinkfloyd,33bddu,RyanIsYoDaddy,2,Tue Apr 21 03:36:37 2015 UTC,"I mean no there isn't anything wrong with it, just wish they would have kept more songs from the last set list and take away those Wall encore songs, either way I am sure it will be fun."

pinkfloyd,339mcy,mrw412,11,Mon Apr 20 19:18:43 2015 UTC,"Interesting thought, makes sense, I also think that some musical areas in Floyd songs can be symbolic for something. For example Echoes, I believe, is about loosing a loved one or growing apart from them, so I always thought the funky part was symbolic for the time spent with that person, since it sounded so upbeat, and the screeching part was that ending, leaving you alone, and depressed, etc."
pinkfloyd,339mcy,Endxsor,2,Mon Apr 20 20:06:53 2015 UTC,"I see echoes as a love song too. Thats why Pink floyd are so great, their lyrics have a diferent meaning on diferent people."

From a static C note to a bent D with vibrato - standing still then a leap airborne.  A rush of excitement and anxiety then to G representing his thoughts of home and a slightly aggressive back and forth in C - his mother.   Back to G and a sequences of bends ascending through C - fighting through the ties that bind reaching new heights - to D.   But once that new height is achieved, fear returns and there is a slow and reluctant decent back to the ground.  Back home. Back to G.    Where it's safer to sing and dream of the sky."

pinkfloyd,3395v7,GnRDanny,5,Mon Apr 20 19:45:47 2015 UTC,"The Madcap Laughs is mostly very different from his Pink Floyd work. Less pop, more folk. That's not a bad thing at all. But Octopus has the Floyd feel to it for sure. If Octopus were recorded with the rest of Pink Floyd behind Syd, it could've been his greatest song with the band.  Barrett (the album) is something you'd like more if you prefer his Pink Floyd sound rather than the darker acoustic sound of most of The Madcap Laughs. Baby Lemonade, Gigolo Aunt, and Effervescing Elephant sound a lot like Piper.  So if you were to listen to four of his solo songs, go for Octopus, Baby Lemonade, Gigolo Aunt, and Effervescing Elephant. The Madcap Laughs has a lot of great stuff other than Octopus, but it's different from Syd's Floyd sound that you like, so take it one step at a time."

Kind of low production value, and I've heard quite a bit of people say they didn't like it that much, but I love it. You can surprisingly hear a bit of the Wall in Syd's singing on this one.  and  Here I Go, which is just a happy, nice song with some folk like sounds.

Trivia:  The lap steel guitar that appears at the end of the studio version of ""Yet Another Movie"" was replaced by a normal guitar solo played at a lower octave on the live performances of the track.

pinkfloyd,335day,Rooster_Ties,11,Sun Apr 19 18:32:38 2015 UTC,Dark Side and WYWH seem to be the only true Floyd albums
pinkfloyd,335day,John_Lives,12,Sun Apr 19 19:04:52 2015 UTC,"This. Once you start labeling certain works as 'not Pink Floyd', you get to the point where only a handful of songs are 'pure' Floyd because everything else is so different."
pinkfloyd,335day,MaxCHEATER64,7,Sun Apr 19 19:13:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not suggesting everything has to be like DSOTM or WYWH.  I'm just saying two things mostly:   Much of the lyrics Dave sings on The Wall just don't seem to fit with him.  (And to a lesser extent, Rick seems out of place on The Wall too.) The SOUND of most of The Wall seems a LOT more like a Roger Waters solo album, than it does a Pink Floyd album.     Everything before The Wall seems like Pink Floyd too me.  And even some things under Gilmour's leadership of Floyd seem a little more ""Floyd""-like to me than The Wall does.  (For the record, I'm more team Dave, though maybe that's obvious)...  ...BUT, I don't go so far as to suggest that AMLOR, TDB, or TER seem just as ""Floyd"" as everything prior to The Wall.  For me, the Gilmour-led Floyd albums seem like some sort of hybrid between ""Floyd"" and ""Gilmour solo"" -- a hybrid of each, neither just one or the other.    And I'm NOT saying The Wall is bad (even though I don't particularly feel very connected to it). Objectively, it's a fantastic album, and Roger is due every credit for creating a masterpiece (not just his masterpiece, but one of THE most important pieces of rock theater of the last 50 years -- if you want to consider Tommy and maybe Jesus Christ Superstar as two of the earliest exemplars, both from the late 60's)."
pinkfloyd,335day,MaxCHEATER64,7,Sun Apr 19 19:29:11 2015 UTC,"The problem with this is that you're subjectively applying logic in contrary to objective fact.  The Wall was factually not a Roger Waters solo album. David Gilmour gave significant contributions to the work (including almost the entirety of ""Comfortably Numb"", ""Run Like Hell"", and the music to ""Hey You"", among others), no matter what you think it sounds like. Wright wasn't even technically part of the band when The Wall was finished, and was even less so during MLOR so that doesn't really count.  I've seen this argument made time and time again, but it's never correct. The Wall is as much of a Waters album was The Piper at the Gates of Dawn was a Barrett album, or The Division Bell was a Gilmour album. They were the driving creative force behind those respective albums, sure, but to say that they were the ONLY meaningful force is an insult to the other contributors.      Also, The Wall sounds absolutely nothing like TPACOHH or KAOS."
pinkfloyd,335day,MaxCHEATER64,2,Sun Apr 19 19:40:36 2015 UTC,"I think quite a fair amount of The Wall sounds like parts of TPACOHH, Amused To Death, and even (to some extent) a bit like KAOS at times too.  Or at least more than almost any Floyd prior to The Wall.  All I'm saying is that there was a BIG sonic shift in what was going on musically that began with The Wall, and continued with The Final Cut.  Not every single song on The Wall -- but close to 75%, I'd guess."

Because, well, first off, I think removing comments is dishonest. I sad it, so I'll stand by it & take whatever lumps I need to take.  But more importantly, I mean it!

pinkfloyd,335day,dredsina,2,Tue Apr 21 04:36:11 2015 UTC,"It's certainly a Waters-led album, no one can really doubt that. Some people will cite Waters being too controlling as the primary factor which shaped the end product, and that might be partly true. However, the rest of the band wasn't contributing all that much, certainly not as much as they did on their previous albums. Waters was essentially just using his own ideas and forming his own sound because the rest of the band wasn't helping him. I think he band was suffering from its vices: Roger's egotism putting the rest of the band off (though we should note he's not the massive narcissist people like to indicate) and making the experience of making the album an unpleasant one. Additionally, David Gilmour had a problem with cocaine and was drinking too much, and I think Rick also a problem with cocaine.   You add those factors to a band whose relationship is already strained by success and creative differences, and you get an album which is either a failure because it features half baked musical ideas each operating under a different vision for the same album, or you get an album which is ultimately carried through by the one member who is enthusiastic about it.   I listened to it today, out of the blue, and I can definitely see why you feel that way. It's Waters vision and the rest of Floyd just seem like session musicians or something. It doesn't have the same airy feel as their other albums, it's so filled with narrative that it doesn't leave room for the music."
pinkfloyd,335day,LazyGamerMike,2,Sun Apr 19 20:48:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly my point, The Wall may be a brilliant album (and objectively, it probably is) -- but the rest of the Floyd seem stylistically removed from the end result, for whatever reasons."
pinkfloyd,335day,youvegottabecrazy,2,Sun Apr 19 20:51:49 2015 UTC,"Despite the fact that it's not high up in my list of favorites, I absolutely characterize it as a Pink Floyd album. It's extremely lyrics-heavy rather than the fantastical soundscape that I prefer out of Pink Floyd (that seems to be missing along with any major musical contribution from Rick), but that's not to say that because Roger was the brains behind it that makes it a Roger Waters album. I'd characterize The Final Cut as a Roger Waters album, though."
pinkfloyd,335day,MaxCHEATER64,1 point,Mon Apr 20 08:03:24 2015 UTC,"I agree, The Final Cut is a Waters album, in everything but the name on the spine.  I don't claim The Wall is a Waters album in the same way as TFC practically is.  But a lot of it is (at least 50%, and arguably maybe a little closer to 70%).  That said, Gilmour's contributions are WAY more significant (or maybe 'memorable' is a better way to say it) to The Wall than they are to TFC.  The Wall may be a Pink Floyd album, but its the first album that really has a lot of that Roger Waters solo SOUND going on.  And not just here and there, but throughout (mostly)."
pinkfloyd,335day,youvegottabecrazy,2,Tue Apr 21 14:11:12 2015 UTC,"Whether or not something is led by one member, or ""truly"" Pink Floyd isn't something I care all too much for; just enjoy the music. I know a lot of people here talk about a lot of the beneath the surface dealings of the band, and same goes for other music and sometimes people's talk affects your position towards the music."

But then I found DSOTM (full album, not just the ""hits"") and if there ever was a gateway drug, DSOTM is exactly that. Before I knew it I was hopelessly addicted to Meddle through Animals, and when I think ""Pink Floyd,"" those are the albums that come to mind.    The Wall is one of my least listened to albums.  I view it as a Waters solo album, though do agree with most of what /u/MaxCHEATER64 wrote in this thread re: the band having many different styles over the years.  It's probably not fair of me to categorize it as a Waters solo album.  But a counter point to that is that most everyone would agree that The Final Cut was essentially a Waters solo album.  And most of those songs were written for The Wall. (As David put it, they weren't good enough to make the cut before. Why are they good enough now?)  The Wall is a fantastic album.  Even though it's one of my least-listened to albums, it's a whole helluvalot better than any album put out by 99.99% of other bands.    Isn't the real problem here that PF is just too damned good?  To bastardize Winnie the Pooh, How lucky we are to have so many great albums that choosing a favourite is so hard."
pinkfloyd,335day,MaxCHEATER64,2,Tue Apr 21 00:57:39 2015 UTC,"And most of those songs were written for The Wall.    False. Three songs were originally going to appear on The Wall (""The Gunner's Dream"", ""The Final Cut"", and I believe ""Your Possible Pasts"" but don't quote me on that).  Gilmour's quote there was about Spare Bricks, an album that was never released.  I'd also disagree that TFC is a waters solo album. It just wouldn't be the same with Clapton on guitar."

pinkfloyd,331rop,PinkFloydBot,8,Sat Apr 18 18:06:56 2015 UTC,"I like this song quite a bit. The lyrics are are some of the best on the whole album (""Stared out the steel of your eyes"" is a brilliant line) the acoustic guitar riff is very soothing, and the solo at the end is great.  The part I could never get behind is the middle section. The carnival noises and everything completely disrupt the flow of the song and feels so out of place. It just seems so random and thrown in there, like they needed to fill the quota of a Pink Floyd album needing a lot of sound effects. It almost ruins the song for me, but the reprise of the at the end saves it.  Overall, it's a solid song."
pinkfloyd,331rop,GusFringus,4,Sat Apr 18 20:07:16 2015 UTC,I used audacity to edit that part out now the song flows just fine.

pinkfloyd,331rop,Flamov,2,Sat Apr 18 19:50:48 2015 UTC,"I love the middle part. It's very atmospheric, and all the noises make you wonder what it might mean. The rest of the song is great, too. Not one of my top three from The Division Bell, but definitely great anyway."
pinkfloyd,331rop,InMyBrokenChair,1 point,Sat Apr 18 23:16:54 2015 UTC,"One of my favorites on TDB. I really like how the song starts with a mellow atmosphere, takes a break with the carnival sequence, and picks up afterwards."
pinkfloyd,331rop,Raisedkaine,1 point,Sat Apr 18 20:30:39 2015 UTC,"The Carnival Section reminds me of the Nick at Night TV show Are You Afraid of The Dark? I edited it out too. Other than that a good song with some very dynamic sounds, and some of the best lyrics by Gilmour/Samson. I like the acoustic guitar chords, reminds me of a nursery rhyme somewhat. (Like Pop Goes The Weasel from Jack In The Box Toys.) Can any guitarist explain what effect DADGAD tuning has on this track? What would sound different if the guitar was tuned another way?"
pinkfloyd,331rop,OfAnthony,2,Sat Apr 18 23:20:56 2015 UTC,"Different tunings simply allow you to play different notes. You usually can't hear a different tuning, because the only reason to change the tuning is so different notes are accessible at the same time, which allows you to play different chords, and different riffs. The song would sound terrible if you tried to play it in standard tuning, because all the notes would be wrong."

pinkfloyd,32zwht,sloonark,-6,Sat Apr 18 16:42:28 2015 UTC,"This might sound harsh, but can anyone explain to me what the big deal about Syd Barrett is? In my opinion, everything Pink Floyd did after him was immensely superior to the Syd-era work.  I've tried to like the songs he wrote/performed and I just can't."
pinkfloyd,32zwht,Tobin321,37,Sat Apr 18 07:35:19 2015 UTC,"Well, it's all about personal preference, isn't it?  Syd's stuff was psychedelic/space rock, the stuff after he left was progressive rock. Completely different. Listen to Syd's original version of Astronomy Domine on The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (in mono), and compare it to David's version on Ummagumma. Completely different genres.  Back to the topic, Syd was incredibly influential. Far more than people realise. Syd never put on a funny singing voice like all the other british acts did at the time to sound more american (The Beatles, etc), he kept his incredibly strong accent through his vocals to make a charming and genuine sound. His lyrics were incredibly upbeat, psychedelic and twee (Bike is the best example of this)  But, while his lyrics were upbeat, they had an element of darkness behind them. Lucifer Sam, for example, switches from a nice kids song about his cat into a strange mini-rant about his girlfriend. (Jennifer Gentle, you're a witch. You're the left side, he's the right side, oh no! Probably about cheating or something). While it switches back, it still has a strange feeling (the instruments are brilliant, a feeling of a cat prowling), and he continues to sing about how his cat should ""be a ship's cat, somewhere, anywhere"". Telling his cat to go see the world and not be locked up in his little apartment.  The next song on Piper, Matilda Mother, is a great example of this as well. At first, it sounds like a nice little fairy tale, but it has a strange level of cynicism behind it. Just by listening to Syd's voice, you can tell there's an element of sadness behind it. He's a grown-up now, he'll never feel like a kid again, but he wants to. He now knows that the world is a lot less fun than it was when he was young.  He wasn't a good lyricist, but was an incredible wordsmith. As Roger Waters points out on some interview, I forgot which, he had a strange british twang and would turn lyrics upside down. Roger really liked him in ""Bike"" (I've got a bike You can ride it if you like It's got a basket a bell and ring and things to make it look good), he doesn't follow the standard method of rhyming, he kinda breaks it in a weird way that sounds very british. This is very prominent in all of his work, and it is very charming. It may sound simple but it makes his lyrics fresh.  His guitar work was great too, he wasn't very flashy and usually sticked in the background, but if you really listened, he was really good. (Interstellar Overdrive in mono is the best example of this)  Of course, post-Piper, as his mental state declined, he wrote some disturbing and morbid but groundbreaking songs, such as ""Scream Thy Last Scream"", ""Vegetable Man"", and of course ""Jugband Blues"". Never before had a song been so upfront about mental illness and pain and sorrow. Just look at this video of Jugband Blues, he looks like a corpse.  Maxcheater did a great analyzation of the lyrics to Jugband Blues here: http://www.reddit.com/r/pinkfloyd/comments/2f49ol/album_analyzation_2_a_saucerful_of_secrets/ck5vemp  His first solo album, ""The Madcap Laughs"" is a continuation of everything he did for Saucerful, and, in my opinion, a masterpiece. I mean, no album before this had ""Inside me I feel... alone and unreal"" placed almost randomly into monotone and depressed love songs, wailing of ""WOULDN'T YOU MISS ME AT ALLLL?"" and a song about how every one of his friends left him. It is a haunting image of mental illness and is every bit as relevant today as when it came out.  Syd was influential both for his work with Pink Floyd and for his solo work, and many bands and artists have sung his praise since. David Bowie even said that Syd was a big inspiration for him, he only started singing in his natural accent after listening to Syd do it. And heaps of punk bands have talked about how great he was too, particularly his solo work."
pinkfloyd,32zwht,FelixAtagong,0,Sat Apr 18 10:52:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that link to the analysis of Jugband Blues, it is interesting, but the reviewer may have over-analysed a bit, at least in my opinion.  The song was already written in January '67 (and sung by Syd on a disappeared demo) before the band even recorded Arnold Layne. Syd may, of course, have altered (some of) the lyrics when they recorded it for ASOS (October '67), but the 'I don't care if the sun don't shine'-line, for instance, literally comes from a Betty Page song, a trick Syd used more than once.   My analysis of the song can be found at the Holy Church of Iggy the Inuit, at Hurricane over London. It has three chapters with a review of the Norman Smith and Chris Joe Beard (Purple Gang) autobiographies, but if you immediately want to read the analysis, go to Jugband Blues."
pinkfloyd,32zwht,Spaceboy_33,6,Sat Apr 18 14:56:15 2015 UTC,"I've been listening to Pink Floyd for about 16 years now, and I didn't start to really enjoy the Barrett-era stuff until recently.  Give it time, because that early psychedelic sound is an acquired taste for some people.    Like Tobin321 says, it's a completely different style of music compared to their more mainstream albums.  I wouldn't say anything after Piper was 'superior', but it's just different in its own, fantastic way."
pinkfloyd,32zwht,Mooshtonk,4,Sat Apr 18 11:54:38 2015 UTC,"It is really hard to explain, and unless you really take the time you wont realize it. I had the EXACT same thoughts as you, I really just did not get wtf people were thinking, I thought ""how could people seriously like this psychedelic stuff?"" Then I kept listening, kept reading up on Syd, then realized how fucked up things really were for him, and how bad they treated him in the end, how resentful he seemed of the band and others up until his death. Like I said it really is hard to explain and it takes time. Just listen to these lyrics, it is the only song written and recorded by him on the 2nd album."

pinkfloyd,32y0ry,RedLewie,2,Sat Apr 18 06:15:18 2015 UTC,"Gilmour's doing just as much. A new solo album in '06, a new Floyd album in '14, and now another new solo album in '15 followed by a tour?  Waters did the whole chronological tours started in the late 90s and ending with the Wall Live. The AtD reissue is because there's a /lot of demand for that - unlike the Floyd stuff which was remastered back in 2011, AtD (to my knowledge) hasn't actually had a remaster yet at all.   The movie is apparently something he's been working on for awhile."

Nevertheless, I do think On an Island is amazing !  And don't get me wrong, I've been to the new Wall show in Paris last year and I enjoyed it very much (maybe that's because I'm a total fanboy). I will obviously go and watch the movie when it comes out.   But when is Roger going to produce some new music?"

Harper was recording his album HQ in Studio 2 of Abbey Road at the same time as Pink Floyd were working in Studio 3, and Roy Harper offered to sing the part (""...for a price"").[3] The song is one of only two songs by the band which is not sung by one of their permanent members, the other being ""The Great Gig in the Sky""."

pinkfloyd,32xvpd,FancyAndImportantMan,1 point,Sat Apr 18 21:28:45 2015 UTC,"The vocals are actually the best on that version. I loved the intimidating/foreboding tone Rick + Guy/Jon brought to the song compared to the normally loopy way those verses are normally done.  And then the guitar solo, simply Gilmour unchained, and I think the effects people worked without a budget that tour, and they just went wild."

It hangs from the ceiling on the PULSE video because it was an indoor show, but outdoors it grew and turned into the enormous disco ball.  Anyway, when the lights turned off everywhere, except for the spots shining on the disco ball, the crowd lost their fucking minds - but in a silent way...Minds were exploding throughout the stadium and jaws were on the ground.

pinkfloyd,32xvpd,PYSHINATOR,3,Sat Apr 18 01:49:25 2015 UTC,"Yes.   When both parts are included, the end result is one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever created. Shine On You Crazy Diamond holds a special spot in my heart. Hell, the whole album of Wish You Were Here deserves this. It'll produce the same emotional response every time I set aside 13 minutes and 32 seconds of my life to listen to it. It is the closest to perfection that not only Pink Floyd, but any musician has unintentionally gotten to.  The song is timeless, and I will never feel tired of listening to it.  I started to really appreciate the song when I was about 14 or so. At the time, I was mostly familiar with The Wall and Dark Side Of The Moon. My dad told me that it was his favorite song of Floyd's at the moment, so I gave it a listen. HOLY. SHIT. I discovered a new side of music, and fell in love within the first few minutes. Five years later, as I type this with the song coming through my headphones, I have that same emotional response from the first time my virgin ears came across it. It put the insecure 13 year old me at ease for those sweet 13 1/2 minutes, and it puts me in a good mood any time I hear it. I've had Bb F G E as my ringtone for the past two years. The song has put tears to my eyes - it has the ability to strike several emotions that I never would have thought to have been possible, and only amplified when I learned the rather depressing story behind the lyrics.  Shine On felt personal, like Roger and David were trying to get through to me, telling me how I am changing, going through life one step at a time - that I am that Crazy Diamond.  Visual art has the Mona Lisa.   Movies have The Shawshank Redemption.   Cars have the Mercedes-Benz 300SL.   Video games have Half-Life 2.   Music has Shine On You Crazy Diamond.   It's a timeless masterpiece that I will forever enjoy. I could see myself using the lyrics as a lullaby to my children in the future."

Granted, it serves a better purpose and function within the contact of SOYCD, but it's lovely in its own right too.  I can't imagine we'll ever hear another note from Household Objects -- but I wish they'd gone ahead and finished the album, and released it.

It's literally ON the wiki.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shine_On_You_Crazy_Diamond  """"Shine On You Crazy Diamond"" is a nine-part Pink Floyd composition written by Roger Waters, Richard Wright and David Gilmour. It is a tribute to former band member Syd Barrett.""  This is also particularly upsetting, direct Richard Wright quote:  ""Roger was there, and he was sitting at the desk, and I came in and I saw this guy sitting behind him--huge, bald, fat guy. I thought, ""He looks a bit...strange..."" Anyway, so I sat down with Roger at the desk and we worked for about ten minutes, and this guy kept on getting up and brushing his teeth and then sitting--doing really weird things, but keeping quiet. And I said to Roger, ""Who is he?"" and Roger said ""I don't know."" and I said ""Well, I assumed he was a friend of yours,"" and he said ""No, I don't know who he is."" Anyway, it took me a long time, and then suddenly I realised it was Syd, after maybe 45 minutes. He came in as we were doing the vocals for Shine On You Crazy Diamond, which was basically about Syd. He just, for some incredible reason he picked the very day that we were doing a song which was about him. And we hadn't seen him, I don't think, for two years before. That's what's so incredibly...weird about this guy. And a bit disturbing, as well, I mean, particularly when you see a guy, that you don't, you couldn't recognise him. And then, for him to pick the very day we want to start putting vocals on, which is a song about him. Very strange."""

It is a tribute to former band member Syd Barrett. The work was first performed on their 1974 French tour, and recorded for their 1975 concept album Wish You Were Here. The song series was intended to be a side-long composition (like ""Atom Heart Mother"" and ""Echoes""), but was ultimately split into two sections and used to bookend the album, with new material composed that was more relevant to this epic, and to the situation in which the band found themselves.

And that's true but considering all sources that are out there say it's about Syd that seems to be the most likely situation. Or maybe it's got a little bit of both Roger and Syd in there, who knows."
pinkfloyd,32xw1e,Murderous_Turkey,4,Sun Apr 19 19:11:21 2015 UTC,"Shine On is all about Barrett. It has been introduced as such since its inception. Every single piece of lyric is about him, and this is obvious to anyone who knows the history.  Have a Cigar is, as Im sure everyone here is aware of, about the band's first experiences with big record label execs and the like, pretending to be such fans of the band while asking an asinine question, such as ""say, which one of you is Pink?"", revealing they in reality dont know the first thing about the band... it's just about signing another cash cow and then milking it for all its worth as quickly as possible. So, as it is about the band's early history, it's certainly about both Roger and Syd in that sense.  With Welcome to the Machine we drift away from biographical or autobiographical nature that were present in the two above, and into more generally dystopian grounds with a more universal appeal, for lack of a better word. Both lyrics-wise, and music-wise, I feel that Welcome to the Machine fits a lot better on Animals than on WYWH... the central pieces for Animals were written around the same time as WYWH, and I think they made a mistake in including WttM on WYWH; they should have kept that in waiting and included it in that other concept which would eventually turn into Animals. It very barely fits with the theme of WYWH, if youre being generous, and fits much better in the theme of Animals.  The title track, which is variously described as being about Syd and that it's about them ""wishing he was there with them to enjoy the success"" or whatever, is actually not specifically about Syd. It can be interpreted to be solely about him if you like, but it would be an alternate interpretation and one that would be incorrect no matter how interesting it may be (I realise this isnt what you were proposing, but this is a very common interpretation so I thought Id address it). Nor is it Roger writing about himself; this isnt past Roger singing to present Roger or vice versa. It is about absentism in general."

Check out the making of WYWH docu, it should be on YT. Waters talks about his various inspirations.    One of the big ones was that with DSOTM the band had achieved all they'd hoped to achieve, and Waters felt that they were not making a serious effort at the follow up album.  Phoning it in, so to speak.  As in, they were present in body, but not in mind & spirit.   As I understand it, the other band members agree with Waters' assessment of their attitude and credit him with being the driving force behind that album."

Gilmour even said thank you to Roger 'for writing the amazing music I can play here tonight' (iirc) at the end of every show on the Division Bell tour. And that was in the 90s.  The reason that Gilmour looks so awkward is because he just isn't comfortable performing. Seriously, look at any live performance of his. He usually stands in one spot and doesn't move or dance or anything the entire time. Roger, on the other hand, jumps around and sometimes even acts out what he's singing. In that performance, Roger was trying to get everyone moving in unison, which is something that David usually doesn't do. He looks awkward because Roger is forcing him out of his comfort zone. Rather humorous if you ask me."

""yes this is David, who's this?... Roger? Roger who? Roger Roger??""). Theyre obviously not buddies, but they never ever were; Pink Floyd were never a ""buddies band"".

The incident though is what reminded David of why he didn't want to tour again with Roger as Pink Floyd or do anything else Floyd related, Roger nailed the last nail in the coffin that night.  Fast Forward to 2011, they had gotten over it, but only enough to tolerate each other and play a couple of songs for benefits, or as in 2011, David doing Roger a favor and playing Comfortably Numb.

And thats what he did; he may have presented his own ideas, but when the others or specifically David didnt think they were good, then Roger was happy to let it go. Roger further said, regarding a possible extended reunion after the Live8 gig, that they are just too different... politically, artistically, in every way, and that while he would be happy to roll over for a single show, he knows with himself that he wouldnt be able to do that for an entire tour.

Trivia (found this one really interesting): Alan can be heard entering the kitchen and gathering supplies at the start of the track, and washing up and exiting the kitchen at the end; a dripping tap can be heard during both of these instances.] On some copies of the vinyl version, the dripping tap at the end of the song is cut into the run-off groove, so it plays on infinitely until the listener removes the stylus from the album, an effect obviously lost on the CD release, though the dripping continues for approximately 17 seconds after all other sounds have ceased.

pinkfloyd,32syy7,sydfloyd42,10,Thu Apr 16 13:47:01 2015 UTC,"I think it was a combination of both these factors. His massive LSD use had already triggered his dormant schizophrenic condition.   That coupled with that the fact that he wanted the Floyd to remain as underground a band as possible but the rest of the band wanted to sell out and get a massive record deal instead.  ""It's awfully considerate of you to think of me here  And I'm much obliged to you for making it clear  That I'm not here.""   It could refer to both his deteriorating mental condition that made him detached and he is also blaming partly the rest of the band who had him sacrifice his artistic integrity by selling out.  ""And I'm wondering who could be writing this song""  That line is clearly a shot at the band for making him sell out the Floyd and it could also in addition refer to his detached state.  All that pressure he had on him partly motivated him towards abusing acid the way he did.  Well, you know the rest!"
pinkfloyd,32syy7,grelch,2,Thu Apr 16 15:27:28 2015 UTC,"I think you've mostly got this. Where I would slightly differ is that, essentially when he wrote this song he knew his time was up with the band and probably didn't care too much about the band's direction anymore. At this point the greater part of him was in departure from himself and he knew intrinsically that his time with both the band and as the person that was Syd was up. How terrifying and alone to understand what's happening to you when no one else has a clue.  This song, and Dark Globe are the two pieces that offer a direct look into this man's psyche, where Syd has deliberately allowed the world a glimpse of what was going on in his mind. Those two songs are why people say much of his work is genius. He is simultaneously talking about his being separated from his band and being separated from himself. He can see both happening and simultaneously. That he was able to simultaneously describe both so deeply using such simple language is miraculous and possibly unprecedented, at least in the pop world. In my opinion Jugband Blues is a great song and is often too easily dismissed by Floyd fans. It's a terribly sad song, but to me it is the absolute perfect final song for the Syd era, and it is one of my favorites."
pinkfloyd,32syy7,sydfloyd42,2,Thu Apr 16 22:41:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was what I found so amazing about the songs he wrote when his mental state was already collapsing.   I feel sorry for what happened to him but I can't help but feel enraptured listening to the songs he wrote during the time of losing his mind, you can hear Syd's schizophrenia through his music and all the regrets and resentment.  And imagine watching Syd live, he used to just stand on the stage for ages, gazing into the distance, into the void, so very detached.  ""Now you got that look in your eyes like black holes in the sky"""

If you're endlessly playing a one-person puzzle game (::cough:: like my wife) then yeah, you are cutting yourself off from the world and missing potentially amazing things, like this guy. If you're, say, Redditting, engaging in social media or even reading news or a book, you are engaging with the world, to an extent, just in a new way. Life through a screen is a poor substitute for seeing it with your own eyes, but it's not this universal evil we have thrust upon ourselves."
pinkfloyd,32ojot,TheCheshireCody,16,Wed Apr 15 18:33:06 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of his points (especially songs like ""Watching TV"" and ""Perfect Sense II"") have to do with us being glued to our screens and being detached from real actual problems in the world like murder and war, treating them as entertainment and not tragedy."
pinkfloyd,32ojot,Leftieswillrule,2,Wed Apr 15 18:40:42 2015 UTC,"Oh, absolutely. When the album came out we had just been through the first Gulf War, and 'The Bravery of Being Out Of Range' is all about what it was like to watch bombings of populated areas - people being murdered - live on TV as if it were Monday Night Football. I'm not discounting his points at all, because they are very good ones; I'm just saying that he is very black-and-white in his assessment (he tends to be that way about most things), and it is, like reality, much more gray area."
pinkfloyd,32ojot,TheCheshireCody,7,Wed Apr 15 18:45:44 2015 UTC,"I must dissent with that. I think it's especially true with Reddit and similar places.  When people look at your content as something to consume, quickly, now not later, etc. eventually you get to the point where you boil everything down to the lowest common denominator. A sort of 'race to the bottom' that we saw with TV, then movies, and now we see it with the internet.  Take, for example, /r/News. An entire world's events condensed  into sentence-long summaries. Most people don't even click the links, they just read those summaries, form a brief opinion on them, and move on. /r/Funny is so much of a low-hanging fruit I'm not even going to bother. Which is ironic, considering the topic at hand.  The point is eventually all media gets reduced to something that gives immediate results and nothing else. And when THAT happens, another form of media will prop up to provide the sophistication lacking in the current form - however, that form will, in due time, follow the same trend as the previous form. First it was newspapers. Now it's the internet. Who knows what it'll be next.  The problem that Huxley, Postman, and Waters were identifying wasn't ""endlessly playing a one-person puzzle game"", or in other words getting endlessly distracted by some mundane thing. The problem was getting endlessly distracted by a mundane world. Because in a society where games are considered the peak method of passing time (in BNW this was drugs; in AOtD it was TV), suddenly EVERYTHING is either a game or gets discarded."
pinkfloyd,32ojot,MaxCHEATER64,2,Wed Apr 15 23:05:50 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree with your comment, but using /r/funny and /r/news to explain why the Internet has degraded is like saying the ink is faded on one of the letters in a 1,000 page dictionary, so the whole book is trashed."

pinkfloyd,32ojot,HadACigar,5,Wed Apr 15 14:59:54 2015 UTC,"Anything can be remixed to surround sound if you have the original audio elements. Jethro Tull has been re-releasing their albums with 5.1 surround mixes, and they're phenomenal. The first four Star Trek series' audio was originally mixed in stereo, but remixed for surround on the DVD and Blu-Ray releases; those also sound amazing. Nine Inch Nails re-released some of their albums in 5.1. What Rog is talking about with the advantage of it having been mixed in Qsound originally is that the spatial relationships of the various sounds have already been mapped out so it makes the 5.1 expansion of the mix easier.   To my ears Holophonics, which was used on The Final Cut and The Pros and Cons Of Hitch-hiking, sounds much better than Qsound. Qsound is great but Holophonics was seriously immersive and did work really well (better, even) on headphones."

"" Rick: Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then, and it all adds up to one thing: you're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.  Ilsa: But, Richard, no, I... I...  Rick: Now, you've got to listen to me! You have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten, we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louie?  Captain Renault: I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.  Ilsa: You're saying this only to make me go.  Rick: I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us, we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.  Ilsa: But what about us?  Rick: We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we, we lost it until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.  Ilsa: When I said I would never leave you.  Rick: And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going, you can't follow. What I've got to do, you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that.

Few bands have exhibited such a differing range of sounds, or enjoyed such notable success.  Known for their wild and highly ‘psychedelic’ live shows, Floyd were snapped up for EMI by Norman Smith who produced their seminal first album Piper at the Gates of Dawn.  Unheard of techniques  After their troubled lead singer Syd Barrett departed, the remaining members threw themselves into studio experimentation. For their album Meddle, they arrived with no written material and created everything from scratch using unheard of techniques such as singing through a ring modulator and feeding a piano through a Leslie rotating speaker.  Dark Side of the Moon  They followed this up with their masterpiece, Dark side of the moon. Using everything from cash registers to the Abbey Road doorman Gerry O'Driscoll, they created one of the best selling albums of all time, shifting more than 50 million units worldwide and remaining glued to the top of the UK charts for 351 weeks.  Their final Abbey Road Studios recorded album, Wish you were here, contained one of their most famous compositions, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, a haunting song dedicated to their errant founder Syd."

I’ve remained an enormous Floyd fan all my life and I’m about to start adding my entire collection of vinyl into discogs so I can start tracking what I do and don’t have; it’s got to the state where I go to stores and don’t have a clue what I own anymore :)  Figured this sub would like to see what I’ve been up to over the years, and the picture is my Floyd collection alone; I have all the various Syd, Roger, David and Rick solo albums tucked away somewhere too (but haven’t found Nick’s Fictitious Sports yet!). I have a bunch of bootlegs and (worryingly) some 7”s that I can’t find at the moment including Money (on pink vinyl) and Another Brick in the Wall PtII). Not Now John and High Hopes are present and correct though!  I guess the rarest in there is the original ’67 pressing of Piper at the Gates of Dawn (back left in the photo). It’s not mint, but it’s not far. I think most of them are original pressings but over the next few days I’m going to go through everything and see what I do and don’t have. Happy to answer any questions.  /edit: Found the 7""s :) ABitW PtII is pretty self-evident, but the Money single on pink vinyl looks like it was re-released to promote the A Collection of Great Dance Songs album; there's an image of it on the back and on the front is written ""For airplay use only, not for resale"". I need to dig in to that one to find out more :)"
pinkfloyd,32kjac,GroovingPict,3,Tue Apr 14 15:09:57 2015 UTC,"Nice collection :)  Yes indeed, the Money single is the 1981 re-recording for A Collection of Great Dance Songs :)  It's hard to judge just from the covers in a lot of cases, but I can tell you that A Nice Pair and Relics are not first issues at least."
pinkfloyd,32kjac,dukemantee,5,Tue Apr 14 20:57:20 2015 UTC,"As a long time vinyl collector this is a really nice looking collection. The ones at the top, the Piper, Saucerful and Dark Side, look original. The Meddle looks like a UK or West German pressing, Atom Heart the same, no stickers on A Nice Pair - actually no stickers on anything which is really nice, a Gigi cover for Ummagumma (!), Pulse vinyl box which is rare. Excellent collection, well done."
pinkfloyd,32kjac,GroovingPict,2,Tue Apr 14 20:37:15 2015 UTC,These all look European. No stickers on A Nice Pair is standard. Gigi cover on Ummagumma is standard (it was only blanked out on the North American issues (and airbrushed away completely on the Australian issues)).
pinkfloyd,32kjac,dukemantee,3,Tue Apr 14 21:00:47 2015 UTC,"As an American I value UK pressings very highly, as they were often better sounding (a higher quality of vinyl used and pressed in smaller numbers) and the album covers were printed better as well. So these are right up my alley."
pinkfloyd,32kjac,GroovingPict,2,Tue Apr 14 21:05:17 2015 UTC,"Thats fair enough, but an ""Ummagumma with Gigi"" is not special, because every single European issue had it, regardless of country and regardless whether it was pressed in 1969 or 1989 ;)"

I am in complete envy of this photo, as the only Floyd on vinyl in my current collection are some nice, NM 1st pressings of: The Wall, Animals, DSOTM, Meddle, and The Endless River (which I've yet to remove from the shrink wrap). In my early years, vinyl was just a format I used to take advantage of my parents' collections, but in my 20's I started getting into collecting it myself while working in various record stores and whatnot. If I'd been as consistently hardcore about vinyl during my lifetime as I am at present, I'd have such a collection as this myself. Well done sir!"

Maybe King Crimson, but I'm having a hard time enjoying anything other than In the Wake of Poseidon and In the Court of the Crimson King when it comes to them.   Favorites besides Pink Floyd would be artists making 80's inspired Synthwave. In other words, a whole different genre. I think I'd drop Miami Nights 1984, Mitch Murder and Le Cassette.  Another band I can't get enough of is Talking Heads but I've found their discography to be quite uneven.

Sure, Dave could have contributed to Pros & Cons, or Amused... (instead of Clapton or Jeff Beck) -- but, frankly Beck does an even better job in the new 'sound-world' of Roger's solo output than Dave did on Final Cut (IMHO), and Clapton brought a new voice too.  Nice to theorize about, but Roger and Dave were just like oil and water after The Wall -- and not just in terms of their personalities, but also (I think) their music."

It was something to dance to, or to be momentarily entertained by. Now, there was this song that just took its time (no pun intended), and went to all these places and back, because it had something to say, and not only with words, but also with sound. It hung onto me, and kept me coming back. It made me think about the lyrics and about the soundscape. It made me want to listen to the rest of the album. It made me buy all of the band's discography, and learn about them. It basically turned me into the nerd I am.  Also the solo... It is, to me, the purest piece of music ever put tape.  I can honestly say that I would be a different person, had I not been exposed to TDSotM, and that song specifically."

pinkfloyd,32j7n4,MaxCHEATER64,1 point,Tue Apr 14 07:50:49 2015 UTC,"I'd be surprised if this was true. Roger's said that he didn't do any drugs with any seriousness during most of his adult life. David and Rick did coke quite a bit during that era but, from as far as we can know from interviews, Nick and Roger really didn't.  As for whether his use of drugs directly influenced the final lyrics of DSOTM, I think it's fair to give that one a flat ""no"". Roger's lyrical style hasn't really change since about 1970, and as he was certainly not smoking anything of any weight in the 1990s I think it's fair to say that in that regard it was just his usual thing. As for the words themselves, you have to keep in mind that Dark Side was constructed over the course of years (they were working on it during the Meddle years and had it almost completed by the time OBC released), and in relation to the length of the album it's no surprise the quality was above and beyond what they had done before."

Its the same way where Animals starts to see Waters being more dominant, has a huge influence on The Wall, and The Final Cut is essentially a solo Waters album.   I don't know where MLOR fits.

pinkfloyd,32dbz9,Flaptothejack,20,Mon Apr 13 23:07:56 2015 UTC,"Roger was the genius behind most of what made Floyd stand above many other bands of the time, and I still MUCH prefer Final Cut + all his solo albums to Momentary lapse, Division Bell, and Endless River."
pinkfloyd,32dbz9,Porcupine_Tree,3,Sun Apr 12 22:07:53 2015 UTC,I fully agree with you. And my favorite aspect of Pink Floyd was the musical tension between him and Gilmore.
pinkfloyd,32dbz9,FizzPig,7,Mon Apr 13 17:57:29 2015 UTC,Careful saying that. The Roger bashers won't like that opinion.
pinkfloyd,32dbz9,MrStudleyDudley,19,Sun Apr 12 22:46:27 2015 UTC,"See, I don't understand why other people don't seem to appreciate the mix of Waters with Gilmour; in my eyes the band is at its best when the sound emanates primarily Gimour's bluesy guitar while the concepts originate from Waters. It is the perfect mix of great music and great ideas, and they are both great when separated for their different styles.  Why are we always quantifying music?"
pinkfloyd,32dbz9,Nick_Squared,12,Mon Apr 13 01:07:32 2015 UTC,"I mean they can enjoy whatever they want it's just my opinion that the emotional aspect of Floyd's music came from Roger's input. I like post-Waters Floyd also, I just don't feel the emotion in it the same way as I do on Roger songs"
pinkfloyd,32dbz9,Porcupine_Tree,18,Sun Apr 12 23:09:52 2015 UTC,There's more emotion in the guitar solo of Time than any lyric Roger has ever written.  Gilmour doesn't need great lyrics. The emotion is all in the strings.
pinkfloyd,32dbz9,GusFringus,7,Mon Apr 13 01:16:54 2015 UTC,I agree. Problem is I listen to momentary lapse+division bell+endless river and that emotion in the guitar is somewhat gone. Then I listen to Roger's solo stuff and Clapton on Pros and Cons has emotional guitar and Beck on Amused to Death has emotional guitar... So I wonder if it was Gilmour that sorta lost it or it was Roger that sorta got it out of him.
pinkfloyd,32dbz9,Porcupine_Tree,5,Mon Apr 13 01:30:54 2015 UTC,"Learning to Fly, On the Turning Away, Sorrow (Gilmour's magnum opus), Cluster One, Marooned, A Great Day for Freedom, Coming Back to Life, Keep Talking, High Hopes, Talkin' Hawkin', Surfacing, Louder Than Words, Castellorizon, On an Island, The Blue, Where We Start  All of those songs just scream so many things. Triumph, sadness, anger, love, aggression, and victory all wrapped up in beautiful bends of the strings. Roger's lyrics are no doubt best, but Gilmour has proved he doesn't need them to keep that emotional core of Pink Floyd.  The guitars on Roger's albums are great, too, though. The solo in What God Wants, Part 3 is one of my favorite guitar solos ever."
pinkfloyd,32dbz9,GusFringus,3,Mon Apr 13 06:54:25 2015 UTC,I agree 100%.  I just find MORE emotion from Roger. And yes What God Wants P3 solo is ridiculous :P  I think High Hopes is dave's opus though... damn those slide solos
pinkfloyd,32dbz9,Porcupine_Tree,2,Mon Apr 13 08:01:46 2015 UTC,"Eh, I still think Wet Dream is the best solo album from any of the band members!"

pinkfloyd,32dbz9,SomeRandomBuddy,7,Mon Apr 13 12:18:35 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar boat, hadn't really taken the time to appreciate it.. but since have given it a chance! I love it now... would say my favourite track is Your Possible Pasts.. not in terms of lyrics, but for the cheer rawness and emotion in the guitar!    I actually gave it anther chance after reading Pigs might Fly, and i think because of how it explained the tension in the band at that point, it let me listen to it with a new perspective! Either way.. love it now!"
pinkfloyd,32dbz9,ElectricNoodle,4,Sun Apr 12 22:05:12 2015 UTC,Mine is definitely The Final Cut (song). Great chord progression and the strings are great which do similar patterns in Comfortably Numb.
pinkfloyd,32dbz9,Fugdish,5,Mon Apr 13 00:06:11 2015 UTC,"Its a very melancholic album. While The Wall was rock opera, The Final Cut feels like a personal conversation.   it really stands out as a unique work. its not really a pink floyd album, since Waters dominates it. By Roger Waters...performed by Pink Floyd is the apt description. That said, you can hear Gilmour and he's not mailing it in. The backing singers for Not Now John become a tool used on MLOR and TDB (especially live performances). Its overtly political, which Pink Floyd never was about.   Its basically Roger Waters' swan song with the band, which amplifies the emotional resonance.   When I was younger, I liked the big sound of MLOR...but as I get older, The Final Cut has meaning to me whereas I'll only Listen to MLOR for Learning to Fly and Sorrow nowadays."
pinkfloyd,32dbz9,dbcanuck,3,Mon Apr 13 00:45:52 2015 UTC,"I used to get annoyed with all the whining Waters did about daddy, war and Maggie, until I put myself in my grandpas position (a WWII fighter) and did some research as well. Now TFC is one of my favorite albums. Funny because I can listen from TFC to AMLOR without really being thrown off by it."
pinkfloyd,32dbz9,dredsina,3,Mon Apr 13 13:20:32 2015 UTC,I've listened to it fully a few times. Still can't get over the music. Maybe one day I'll appreciate it.
pinkfloyd,32dbz9,Anticitizen_01,3,Sun Apr 12 22:20:12 2015 UTC,I listen to this album at least once a month. IMO it is the most underrated of all their albums.
pinkfloyd,32dbz9,andres92,5,Mon Apr 13 04:41:58 2015 UTC,It's pretty damn great. I recently started learning to play a bunch of the songs from it after seeing Brit Floyd do The Final Cut (the song) and they're a hell of a lot of fun. Not to mention it's just as (if not more) conceptual than The Wall.
pinkfloyd,32dbz9,tanukis_parachute,4,Sun Apr 12 22:35:26 2015 UTC,"For me, from meddle to endless river- it is my least favorite Floyd album.  It has some moments and some songs I like but not enough for me to put it in and sit thru it.   I prefer it to all of Rogers solo albums but I've never been a fan of those.  I admit that I am on team gilmour, mason, and wright."
pinkfloyd,32dbz9,tunnel-snakes-rule,4,Mon Apr 13 00:35:25 2015 UTC,"I think my introduction to The Final Cut helped colour my view of it. Growing up in the mid nineties my parents owned Dark Side Of The Moon, The Wall and The Final Cut.  I'd listened to The Wall and it kind of blew my mind. I wanted to hear more like this, so I went straight to The Final Cut, and like The Wall, it was like nothing I'd heard before (I didn't have a lot of musical interest at the time).  It was moody, and weird, quiet and introspective at times but then it'd explode in a cascade of musical brilliance.  I loved it, even Roger's questionable singing abilities.  But I think what really got to me was the content of the songs. It was really the first album where I sat and listened to the lyrics and a lot of it still really gets to me.   and as the windshield melts  my tears evaporate  leaving only charcoal to defend  finally i understand  the feelings of the few  ashes and diamonds  foe and friend  we were all equal in the end"

pinkfloyd,32fmmb,SomeRandomBuddy,3,Mon Apr 13 15:34:39 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say hate, but I think a lot of people dislike Waters because, in a way, he used the Pink Floyd name to push a politically-orientated 'solo album', The Final Cut, and then sued the other members when they continued on with the Gilmour-era. I believe that's where a lot of the ""hate"" comes from, for Waters at least.  I personally don't agree with it, but I understand why people may feel that way. Floyd has always been bigger than the sum of its parts, and that's what has made it so great through all phases."
pinkfloyd,32fmmb,Flamov,2,Mon Apr 13 13:34:51 2015 UTC,"I think its a mix of the Waters/Gilmour thing, and the fact that this is a sub dedicated to a band that was heavily active in the 60's - late 80's and hasn't really put anything out as monumental as their earlier hits (except for our momentary burst of content following the Endless River release, which still didn't involve their entire floyd lineup)...so its really easy for everything to get hyper-analyzed over and over and over again."

pinkfloyd,32ej7b,InMyBrokenChair,2,Mon Apr 13 05:26:41 2015 UTC,"I think it's easily his best solo album. Radio KAOS is, to me, much too 80s sounding. Pros and Cons is decent, but Amused to Death is better. Really the only parts I dont really care for are the various What God Wants parts. I love the lyrics on it. ""And when they found our shadows grouped round the TV sets, they ran down every lead; they repeated every test. They checked out all the data on their list, and then, the alien anthropologists admitted they were still perplexed. But on eliminating every other reason for our sad demise, they logged the only explanation left: this species has amused itself to death"".  I disagree that Roger's voice is dull on it. People usually say that David has the best singing voice of the two, and maybe he does have the prettiest/most soothing singing voice, but his is also the easiest to imitate (I can sing any Gilmour part with ease), whereas Roger's may be more gritty or ""ugly"", but it is great for its use, which is to convey this intense angsty emotional feeling. And I sure cant imitate it, nor is there many who can. And thats not different on Amused to Death I think: the range is still here, from the quiet to the intense, and it's certainly not dull to my ears."
pinkfloyd,32ej7b,GroovingPict,1 point,Mon Apr 13 23:29:29 2015 UTC,Radio KAOS is by far my favorite of his solo albums. Followed by Pros & Cons. I didn't really enjoy his anti-corporate griping on Amused to Death and musically it didn't do much for me either.
pinkfloyd,32ej7b,ChuckEye,1 point,Mon Apr 13 05:01:23 2015 UTC,"Like some of the more dense Pink Floyd albums, it will take multiple listens to appreciate.   The Bravery of Being Out of Range, Watching TV, and Amused to Death are all fantastic songs. I'd say its his best song writing ever, and I'm not surprised he semi-retired after this album -- he was unlikely to match it.   Radio KAOS feels very dated (although not as much as MLOR), and I never really got into Pros & Cons. But Amused to Death I think its a hidden gem."

pinkfloyd,32dcwq,BamaDillert,1 point,Mon Apr 13 03:11:14 2015 UTC,that's not a fair comparison. Nashville Skyline and New Morning were done during a rare period in the early 1970s when Dylan had quit smoking which made his voice sound better than it did before that or after.
pinkfloyd,32dcwq,FizzPig,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:05:37 2015 UTC,"I suppose you're right - his voice never sounded like that before or after the album. Even still, there's a huge difference between his earlier stuff and his newer things. It's gruff and gravelly now, and you can hear him straining a bit to hit higher notes, whereas on a song like ""All I really want to do"" from 1964, the vocals are sustained longer and are generally stronger."
pinkfloyd,32dcwq,BamaDillert,2,Mon Apr 13 20:51:25 2015 UTC,"McCartney's voice is so shot it's painful to listen sometimes. Yet he still sells out 70,000 seat stadiums all over the world."
pinkfloyd,32dcwq,dukemantee,2,Mon Apr 13 18:41:10 2015 UTC,"I saw him 4 years ago in Denver and his voice wasn't noticeably worse but when he was on the SNL 40 anniversary, his voice was SO BAD, I felt kinda sad."
pinkfloyd,32dcwq,thiscouldbeben,3,Mon Apr 13 19:47:31 2015 UTC,I saw him live this past July and his vocals were MUCH better live in the arena than when he was on SNL.
pinkfloyd,32dcwq,bearicorn,7,Mon Apr 13 19:49:47 2015 UTC,"He had to go through extensive vocal training to be able to sing The Wall again for the recent tour, and even then some of the songs were played in different keys to accommodate. Most people's voices just get less flexible/lower as they age."
pinkfloyd,32dcwq,andres92,6,Mon Apr 13 03:09:20 2015 UTC,Singing Careful With that Axe Eugene isn't probably the best thing for your voice.
pinkfloyd,32dcwq,heavymetal252,2,Mon Apr 13 07:55:24 2015 UTC,Dat scream though...
pinkfloyd,32dcwq,dalekslayer96,1 point,Mon Apr 13 10:24:07 2015 UTC,Hasn't done it since '77 though
pinkfloyd,32dcwq,MaxCHEATER64,5,Mon Apr 13 20:52:07 2015 UTC,"AtD sounded exceptionally bad for him...if you listen to some of his concerts of the era, he definitely didn't always sound as bad as he did on that album.  But the most important part is that almost ten years passed between TFC and ATD. He was 40 when TFC was made, but he was 49 when ATD was made...that'll do a lot to your singing ability."
pinkfloyd,32dcwq,MaxCHEATER64,2,Sun Apr 12 22:10:10 2015 UTC,But even with the 4 years between Radio KAOS and ATD he still sounds quite a lot worse.
pinkfloyd,32dcwq,FedoraTipper15,2,Sun Apr 12 22:16:52 2015 UTC,"As I said, AtD sounded particularly bad for him, not sure why. Maybe he had the flu or something."
pinkfloyd,32dk2v,dredsina,15,Sun Apr 12 22:14:42 2015 UTC,I've never heard David say his favorite is Obscured By Clouds. Wish You Were Here's Wikipedia page says it's David's favorite as well as Rick's.  Roger's is either Dark Side or The Wall because he says those are the only things he's done that he likes more than Amused To Death.
pinkfloyd,32dk2v,InMyBrokenChair,1 point,Sun Apr 12 23:18:14 2015 UTC,Which is ironic because he once said that he felt that ATD was better than DSOTM or The Wall.
pinkfloyd,32dk2v,MaxCHEATER64,6,Mon Apr 13 01:42:18 2015 UTC,lol no way ATD is better than those too -_- not even as good as TPACOH IMO
pinkfloyd,32dk2v,Tactical_Lemon,7,Mon Apr 13 02:34:35 2015 UTC,"Iirc he said that shortly after it came out, so he was probably just trying to advertise."

pinkfloyd,32dk2v,Tactical_Lemon,7,Mon Apr 13 03:50:11 2015 UTC,I would probably say The Wall.
pinkfloyd,32dk2v,mrw412,6,Sun Apr 12 23:18:04 2015 UTC,"Probably The Final Cut...most likely, you can guess why."
pinkfloyd,32dk2v,grelch,3,Sun Apr 12 22:42:15 2015 UTC,"Seeing as he toured the album on his own for 2+ years 30 years after the album was released, he's written (but not produced) a Broadway version of the album, made a feature length film based on the album..... I'd say he's answered this question fairly conclusively."

Not sure where you got ObC from.  Waters would probably put on record that The Wall was his favorite, but who knows what he actually things."
pinkfloyd,32dk2v,Lunasee1,2,Mon Apr 13 01:42:02 2015 UTC,I can't remember where I got OBC from? But I'm pleased to find BOTH Rick and Dave's favorite album is WYWH because that's my favorite.
pinkfloyd,32dk2v,InMyBrokenChair,1 point,Mon Apr 13 05:37:02 2015 UTC,I remember hearing an interview David said OBC was one of his favorites (not his favorite).  The reason being that it didn't have a concept.
pinkfloyd,32d3zk,mrrobopuppy,5,Sun Apr 12 20:02:25 2015 UTC,"Just the name.  http://www.reddit.com/r/pinkfloyd/comments/2otquf/68/  It's also worth noting that 'summer' was used as a metaphor for being free, whereas 'autumn' in this sense is a metaphor for moving on, or the end of that freedom."
pinkfloyd,32d3zk,MaxCHEATER64,3,Sun Apr 12 20:24:28 2015 UTC,"Well Summer '68 is known for being a Wright piece, but the name of Autumn '68 comes from the fact that it was literally taken from an organ recording that Rick did in Autumn of 1968. The naming convention is the same because of the callback."
pinkfloyd,32d3zk,Leftieswillrule,2,Sun Apr 12 20:13:21 2015 UTC,"While true, the organ piece was recorded in 1969!"
pinkfloyd,32d3zk,maakuz,2,Sun Apr 12 20:15:02 2015 UTC,There's conflicting information on that. David says it was 1968 but other sources say it was June 1969.

pinkfloyd,3291sw,Gexthelizard,10,Sat Apr 11 19:12:50 2015 UTC,The only thing I dislike about this song is that it necessitates listening to the entirety of the album first as a lead up in order to get the full impact.

pinkfloyd,3291sw,maakuz,2,Sat Apr 11 18:03:34 2015 UTC,"I love it.  I've brought this up before but I love how the song is part of the Breathe/Breathe (Reprise) songs, even referred to as Breathe (Part 3) in early recordings and tabs.

Pink Floyd saved me from going in to a dark dark dark place. Oddly enough, this song is on the ""dark"" side of the moon haha.   This song is super psychedelic.

Got about three quarters of his work and all the incantations (lol) of Tubular Bells and I never made the comparison. Gilmour's roots is in the blues (American), while Oldfield's points more to British folk tradition. The Endless River, though, has some parts that made me think of Oldfield indeed, rather than Pink Floyd. While I like both, and don't make me chose between them, I would say that Oldfield is perhaps the better player, technically speaking, but Gilmour is the most emotional."

pinkfloyd,3261n9,Stone_Crowbar,1 point,Sun Apr 12 18:06:56 2015 UTC,Depends on where you buy them. I see them go from $15-$17 in record stores. Unless it's a first pressing or a sort of special edition (i.e colored vinyl).
pinkfloyd,3261n9,KIMrPickle,1 point,Sun Apr 12 23:39:41 2015 UTC,I'll be needing to check out a record store then. =) (I'm new to vinyl and mostly buy over the internet or haphazardly stumbling across it at yard sales/bookstores.)

The song is phenomenal and is by far my favorite.   David - Wots... Uh the Deal?  This one is REALLY hard for me to decide because David's voice sounds amazing in almost everything, but in Wots... Uh the Deal in particular it just stands out so much more for some reason. I guess it's the harmonizing he does with himself that makes it so great to me but I love it!  Rick - Summer '68  I always feel Rick's vocals are under-appreciated and I wish he sang more, but Summer '68 is his best by far. It may just be the way Rick and David harmonize with each other, but I think it's Rick's vocals at his best.  Nick - Corporal Clegg  I think Nick does a great job of capturing the sarcastic tone of this song. His voice isn't half bad, it'd be cool if he sang on more tracks!  Syd - Jugband Blues  Okay this one's kinda hard too because Syd has this voice that rarely changes from song to song. This song though I feel like he shows some flash of emotion, which I typically don't see in the songs he sings on, so I love it!  EDIT: I DIDN'T KNOW WE COULD PICK DUETS TOO!  David/Rick - Echoes  David and Rick harmonize really well on almost everything, but this one is the best example of them together for sure!   David/Roger - Comfortably Numb  Gotta agree with you with Comfortably Numb. They both give me chills on their respective parts.  Rick/Syd - Matilda Mother  Syd always does a great job capturing the whole ""child-like"" theme in his songs and his vocals match that, and Rick does a lovely job being the ""mother"" in the song.  Also Corporal Clegg has the entire band in it on vocals so that gets an honorable mention for EVERYONE!"

pinkfloyd,32574x,Rooster_Ties,3,Fri Apr 10 19:16:03 2015 UTC,None of them. Post-Floyd time is usually occupied by quiet introspection and mental dissertation of what I just heard.
pinkfloyd,32574x,MaxCHEATER64,1 point,Fri Apr 10 18:30:28 2015 UTC,I feel like this is quite a good reason if there's any.
pinkfloyd,32574x,Rooster_Ties,2,Fri Apr 10 18:33:11 2015 UTC,"I often put Wish You Were Here or Animals on, on repeat -- but START them somewhere in the middle.  For Wish You Were Here, I often start on the last track (the last half of SOYCD) -- and Animals I often start closer to the end as well (either on 3 Pigs or else Sheep).  Boring way to re-sequence the album slightly (boring, and lazy)."
pinkfloyd,32574x,Rooster_Ties,1 point,Fri Apr 10 19:19:46 2015 UTC,"Interesting way of doing it. What's your reason for ""re-sequencing"" them like that?"
pinkfloyd,32574x,Stone_Crowbar,2,Fri Apr 10 19:24:25 2015 UTC,"Well, for one - sometimes I don't quite get to the end of a CD, because I get a phone call, or something comes up - or it's time to watch something on TV.  So the last half of the CD I've listened to less than the first half (and especially the last song).  But I've listened to the first half (or the first track, especially) -- more than anything at the very end.  (Interruptions don't happen all the time, but they do happen.)"
pinkfloyd,32574x,GristleCZ,1 point,Fri Apr 10 19:34:06 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay that makes sense. Hell that's a good idea (interruptions do indeed happen sometimes)"
pinkfloyd,32574x,thedude37,2,Fri Apr 10 21:23:00 2015 UTC,Animals and The Wall.
pinkfloyd,32574x,GroovingPict,2,Sat Apr 11 02:10:41 2015 UTC,I listen to Pink Floyd daily. I literally cant have my day without atleast few favourite songs. My choose always depends on my mood. But If I should choose it would be probably Meddle or WYWH.
pinkfloyd,32574x,irkdesu,1 point,Sun Apr 12 14:09:52 2015 UTC,Lately it's been Obscured by Clouds and Pulse.  OBC because it's such a good album and Pulse because the tribute band I joined does the Pulse versions of most of the set.
pinkfloyd,32574x,KIMrPickle,1 point,Sat Apr 11 03:31:15 2015 UTC,"I can see maybe playing Animals or WYWH or The Final Cut or whatever twice or more in a row, but for stuff like Dark Side or The Wall, or Meddle (because of Echoes), it would be too exhausting. There's a story, a theme, a buildup, and a climax. It would be the equivalent of immediately rewatching a very emotional movie or something, right after finishing it and the credits begin to roll... you have to let your mind process it first, let the musical ""meal"" sink, before having another bite of it... You've just been on a journey, you need to rest and let it sink in and process it before doing the same excact journey one more time... otherwise the second time would not be equally enjoyable I think. Im not sure Im explaining it very well :P"
pinkfloyd,32574x,irkdesu,2,Fri Apr 10 19:05:31 2015 UTC,"I like repeating The Wall a few times because, as far as I'd heard, it's actually a circular album? I suppose if it's a circular plot then the meaning is that Pink is constantly living his life over and over in his head after his final crash, still unwilling to take steps toward recovery and sinking further and further downward. So it becomes less a circle and more a spiral. It depends on which version, too - the live performance in Berlin punches less during the Trial and has a last track for Live Aid that totally changes the denouement. The 1980 live performance works well for it, though. Looking forward to a CD copy of the 2013 tour, it was great live!  I think about this album a lot. It's great for drives and for making art."
pinkfloyd,323uxg,neagrigore,2,Fri Apr 10 10:46:14 2015 UTC,That was unsettling.
pinkfloyd,323uxg,paulblart_smallcop,2,Fri Apr 10 15:57:38 2015 UTC,Something most people may not know: Munch did four versions of The Scream painting plus a lithograph
pinkfloyd,323uxg,GroovingPict,2,Fri Apr 10 19:24:33 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but that was cheesy as hell. I liked the non-dancy parts of it though.
