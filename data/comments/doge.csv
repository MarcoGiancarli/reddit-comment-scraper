doge,2siqc0,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Jan 15 19:24:42 2015 UTC,"Section 4. Popular culture: the legend of the boy and the dike of article  Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates:       A small fictional story within the novel has become well known in its own right in American popular culture. The story,  read aloud in a schoolroom in England, is about a Dutch boy who saves his country by putting his finger in a leaking dike. The boy stays there all night, in spite of the cold, until the adults of the village find him and make the necessary repairs.  In the book, the boy and the story are called simply ""The Hero of Haarlem"". Although the hero of the dike-plugging tale remains nameless in the book, Hans Brinker's name has sometimes erroneously been associated with the character.  This small tale within Hans Brinker or The Silver Skates has generated numerous versions and adaptations in American media. Poet Phoebe Cary — at whose New York City literary gatherings Dodge was a regular guest  — wrote a lengthy poem about it called ""The Leak in the Dike"", published posthumously in 1873,   which has been widely anthologized in books of poetry for schoolchildren.  Cary also gave the boy a name: Peter.  The tale has also inspired full-fledged children's books of its own, which include:   The Hole in the Dike, by Norma Green (1974) The Boy Who Held Back the Sea, by Lenny Hort (1987)   For tourism purposes, statues of the fictional dike-plugging boy have been erected in Dutch locations such as Spaarndam, Madurodam and Harlingen. The statues are sometimes mistakenly titled ""Hans Brinker""; others are known as ""Peter of Haarlem"". The story of the dike-plugging boy is, however, not widely known in the Netherlands — it is a piece of American, rather than Dutch, folklore.    Versions of the story prior to Hans Brinker appear in several English-language publications from 1850 onward, including the following British and American publications:  In the United Kingdom:   An 1850 edition of Sharpe's London Journal of Entertainment and Instruction: ""The Little Hero of Haarlem""   The February 23, 1850, edition of Eliza Cook's Journal: ""The Brave Little Hollander""  The 1855 edition of Beeton's Boy's Own Magazine: ""The Little Dutch Hero""  The 'Sixth' Standard Reader, compiled by J.S. Laurie (1863): ""The Little Dutch Hero""    In the U.S.:   Harper's Magazine, August 1850: ""The Little Hero of Haarlem""  The 1852 edition of The Ladies' Repository: ""The Little Hero of Haarlem""  In 1854, Literary Gem: Van Court's New Monthly Magazine: ""The Little Hero of Haarlem""  Julia Matilda Olin's 1856 book, A Winter at Wood Lawn  In 1857, McGuffey's New High School Reader for Advanced Classes: ""The Little Hero of Haarlem""  In 1858, The Rhode Island Schoolmaster: ""The Boy at the Dike""  In 1858/1859, Sargent's School Monthly: ""The Boy at the Dike""    The actual authorship and genesis of the story of the boy and the dike is currently unknown, but it is possibly from a hypothetical but unidentified story by French author Eugenie Foa (1796–1852), appearing as an alleged English translation, ""The Little Dykeman"", in Merry's magazine in 1868.    In sum, although Dodge was not the originator of the story of the boy and the dike, the immense popularity of her novel Hans Brinker or The Silver Skates made the story very widely known. The story within a story of the nameless little boy's heroism also parallels and emphasizes Hans Brinker's own heroism in the novel.

The main ingredients are plain flour, butter, yeast, caster sugar, currants and sultanas.  Larger versions baked in a loaf tin are known as saffron cake.  In parts of Britain, the buns were traditionally baked on sycamore leaves and dusted with powdered sugar. [citation needed]  The ""revel bun"" from Cornwall is baked for special occasions, such as anniversary feasts (revels), or the dedication of a church. In the West of Cornwall large saffron buns are also known as ""tea treat buns"" and are associated with Methodist Sunday School outings or activities.

The very characteristic mix of round corners and a sharp turn in the bottom-left corner lets us catch a glimpse of the very different mindsets of the Shibe. If you watch closely you also notice all the hidden symbolism in the, seemingly random, dark spots - the way they are arranged are by no means random!  The crooked writing above the Shibe's head tells us all about the self-awareness of the fella on the paper.  Let the intense stare of the Shibe pierce your soul whilst you ponder the meaning of life itself."

Fear of the doge,fear of the doge  I have constant wow that something's always near  Fear of the doge,fear of the doge  I have much phobia that someone's always there  Have you run your paws down the wall  And have you felt your neck fur crawl  When you're searching for the moon ?  Sometimes when you're scared to take a look  At the corner of the room  You've sensed that shibe's watching you.  Have you ever been mining alone at night  Thought you heard footsteps behind  And turned around and no-one's there ?  And as you quicken up your hashrate  You find it hard to look again  Because you're sure there's a shibe there  Watching nascar films the night before  Debating dogecoin and bitcoin  The unknown troubles on your mind  Maybe the market is playing tricks  You sense,and suddenly eyes fix  On dancing shadows from behind.  Fear of the doge, fear of the doge  I have a constant fear, thought you heard  Fear of the doge, fear of the doge  I have a phobia that  shibe's always there.

doge,2j7aj4,autowikibot,2,Tue Oct 14 09:35:18 2014 UTC,"Favicon:       A favicon /ˈfævɪkɒn/ (short for Favorite icon), also known as a shortcut icon, Web site icon, tab icon, Irina or bookmark icon, is a file containing one or more  small icons, most commonly 16×16 pixels, associated with a particular Web site or Web page.   A web designer can create such an icon and install it into a Web site (or Web page) by several means, and graphical web browsers will then make use of it.  Browsers that provide favicon support typically display a page's favicon in the browser's address bar (sometimes in the history as well) and next to the page's name in a list of bookmarks.  Browsers that support a tabbed document interface typically show a page's favicon next to the page's title on the tab, and site-specific browsers use the favicon as a desktop icon.     Image i - Wikipedia's favicon, shown in an older version of Firefox (from 2008).

doge,2gp44h,TheWalrus93,3,Wed Sep 17 21:06:03 2014 UTC,False. The Doge was elected; dukes are hereditary.
doge,2grpgv,bigbullox,2,Thu Sep 18 15:35:35 2014 UTC,"Geneforge.  The story is pretty fantastic, quick summary of the intro (no spoilers):   You belong to a race of wizards who create creatures for different functions to do their bidding.  You end up on an island that has been abandoned for 200 years where these creatures have started to become more self aware and split into various factions (those who believe you should be worshipped & obeyed, those who believe they have as many rights as you, those who believe you should be killed for making them slaves and then leaving them to die).  You ending up on this island starts to shake things up, makes demands of your moral compasss & there are other parties with varied interests besides these main factions.   The writing itself is a little lacking, not anywhere near as well written as the Black Isle games, but the story developments and motivations of various characters are enough to keep me wanting to know more.  Combat is pretty bad too; turn based, overpowered class is a boring imo summoner, fighter/archer & wizard classes are seriously underpowered with no defensivee abilities to speak of requiring you to lure 1 enemy at a time and/or using weaker summons to tank.    tl;dr it is a fantasy novel (there is a lot of reading)"

(You can only get in with an organized tour group). The trip was great and there was a lot more freedom than I expected in terms of photos and interacting with locals. We saw tons of monuments, the DMZ/border with South Korea, the insane mausoleum of the former leaders, and even got to hang with some locals in a beer hall and a park. One of the tour guides was pretty strict with us and we were unsure which things were staged, though it seemed like most of it wasn't. All in all a really fascinating trip--100% recommend!"

doge,2g0wyj,golfreak923,-1,Thu Sep 11 16:51:15 2014 UTC,"It's not that, in Japanese it (こんあにコンパクト) literally translates to 'such compact' but colloquially expressed in English as 'very compact' or 'so compact'. In Japanese they can say 'very' compact but that sounds a little casual so they use こんあに (such) for emphasis.   Also this was in a 100yen store so I don't think think accurate translation is high on their priorities."

doge,2e3bun,Rakonas,1 point,Wed Aug 20 17:38:18 2014 UTC,"Yes, for an annual fee of $500 or so, depending on the state you incorporate in. MA is $500. DE is also a popular choice because of their favorable/well established corporate legal system. But if you register in a state you don't live in you'll need to pay a company to have a registered office there for you.   And there aren't too many benefits in the long run. Sure, you can attribute expenses to the business and write them off(lower your adjusted gross income) thus lowering your tax liability. But only if those expenses relate to the business category or operations you declare. And if you never record income against it, it looks more like a farce and the irs would investigate.   But if you have a good size photography business for example, you'd want to do so. You'd be spending tons of money on equipment etc and receiving income. Probably worth the $500 upfront in tax reductions later."
