We are going to continue with the WIKI PROJECT trying to create an introductory subgenre list for newcomers and novices wanting to make sense of this big noisy mess. I think the Death and Thrash went pretty alright and we sort of went off the road and slammed into a fruit cart when we tried black metal. No matter. We have a few more and then I am going to make a future post where we can hold up progress with squabbling and fillabusters. We are onto something maybe a little easier.   DOOM.   I think we can keep this easy by focusing on just traditional doom without the combination of sludge or stoner. I expect a few lists to be pretty much hitting that 75% mark which I think is perfect for a newcomer.    Black Sabbath - Black Sabbath / Master of Reality Pentagram - Pentagram Saint Vitus - Born Too Late Trouble - Trouble Candlemass - Epicus / Nightfall (?)

Black Sabbath - Masters of Reality (self titled was mostly hard rock except the opening track, and Paranoid was yet to settle into a more defined style.  Candlemass - Epicus Doomicus Metalicus  Electric Wizard - Dopethrone  Ahab - The Call of the Wretched Sea  My Dying Bride - Songs of Darkness Words of Light  Saint Vitus - Hallows Victim or Born too Late  Thou - Heathen or another (Yob?) to show a modern favourite that borders to sludge.   maybe Eyehategod - Dopesick  Still not 10. But I feel that unlike in black metal, th subgenres (funeral, stoner, sludge, gothic/peaceville) are significant enough to warrant inclusion."
Metal,3e25e3,TOUCHER_OF_SHEEP,2,Tue Jul 21 11:42:05 2015 UTC,I'd pick Turn Loose the Swans or The Angel and the Dark River over Songs of Darkness Words of Light.

Metal,3e25e3,relinquishy,2,Tue Jul 21 12:28:10 2015 UTC,Thou and eyehategod get into sludge terriroty which is another big can of worms becasue you would have to include Melvins to begin with. Stoner doom is also another big long list.
Metal,3e25e3,TOUCHER_OF_SHEEP,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:49:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah but when people ask about stoner, theres ALWAYS two or three go-tos, Dopethrone being probably the most prominent. We dont need to cover everything, but to represent it would suffice.  Its not my list, but I honestly feel that whilst the newer splinters of black metal dont yet represent the genre (and may burn out within a few years anyway). I think the subgenres of doom are too prominent to ignore. If I was to reccommend someone to a list of doom, and that list only included traditional, I'd be skeptical.  Personally. Haha. Not trying to be hard on ya man.  As far as sludge, I'd be okay with its  [edit] exclusion, but like before, we dont need to list everything from each subgenre. A particularly doomy yet significant album would suffice, my personal thought wat Eyehategod; Melvins werent doomy enough (from what I know of them. They have way too many albums)."
Metal,3e25e3,relinquishy,2,Tue Jul 21 11:55:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah but when people ask about stoner, theres ALWAYS two or three go-tos, Dopethrone being probably the most prominent. We dont need to cover everything, but to represent it would suffice.   I really don't think that it should be, considering how unrelated it is to the vast majority of stoner being released. IMO Holy Mountain, a Kyuss album (I'd let someone more into them than I pick it), and maybe a Church of Misery album would be all that would be necessary for it, considering the general lack of diversity and history that stoner has compared to more fully-fledged subgenres; it's almost more of a fuzzy style than anything else.   I think the subgenres of doom are too prominent to ignore. If I was to reccommend someone to a list of doom, and that list only included traditional, I'd be skeptical.   I disagree that there have been enough gothic doom or melancholic whatever the hell Warning type bands to merit a list in an essential introductory list; while both have a few prominent popular bands, overall that sort of thing is a lot less popular in the genre aside from those bands than the rest of the genre itself is, and honestly, they're more of an exception than a rule; people will stumble into them later, but the foundation is more important.   As far as sludge, I'd be okay with its [edit] exclusion, but like before, we dont need to list everything from each subgenre. A particularly doomy yet significant album would suffice, my personal thought wat Eyehategod; Melvins werent doomy enough (from what I know of them. They have way too many albums).

Metal,3e25e3,deathofthesun,2,Tue Jul 21 16:20:27 2015 UTC,"it's almost more of a fuzzy style than anything else.   ehehehehhe  Anyways, a purely stoner metal list would probably go something like:  Sleep - Sleep's Holy Mountain  Kyuss - Blues For The Red Sun  Corrosion of Conformity - Deliverance  Orange Goblin*  Probably a Monster Magnet album but I don't care for them  Acid King - ?  Clutch - Transnational Speedway League or s/t (not metal but important)  Fu Manchu   and then you can get into stuff like Soundgarden that gets into sludge territory or other stoner rock/metal bands  and then newer stuff like Sandrider, High on Fire, Karma To Burn"

I threw together a Spotify playlist and some YouTube links and she's been working through them.  Then she made a spreadsheet for comments and criticism.

The two that always stuck out to me was that with the revival of 80s style in both Synthwave/Retrowave and more 80s Speed/heavy and crossover thrash bands, I'm surprised I havent heard anyone try to combine the 80s of metal with the 80s of synth, even for just intros and choruses.  Also, when I heard Electric Wizards ""Time to Die"" song, I noticed the subtle harpsichord in the background of the chorus. But despite a heavy, heavy influence of blues riffing and lyrical themes in stoner doom metal, I'm not aware of any bands that actually incorporate blues instruments into Stoner Doom, outside of the guitar. Harpsichord, Harmonica, Fiddle, all seem under represented in what is obviously a delta-blues influenced genre."
Metal,3e25e3,deathofthesun,6,Tue Jul 21 11:21:16 2015 UTC,"In what way is harpsichord a blues instrument? Not trying to call you out or anything, I'm genuinely curious."
Metal,3e25e3,Gay_For_Gary_Oldman,2,Tue Jul 21 11:34:50 2015 UTC,"I was thinking delta blues and soul. The kind of New Orleans, swampland sound. Harpsichord goes with that, right? And sounded hauntingly killer in Time to Die."
Metal,3e25e3,deathofthesun,8,Tue Jul 21 11:45:43 2015 UTC,"I'm seeing where the confusion is now - the instrument Electric Wizard used is a Hammond organ, not a harpsichord - this is what a harpshichord sounds like. Hammond organs definitely show up in blues, RnB and soul music, though I wouldn't associate it with delta blues given the genre predates the instrument."

How many speed metal or crossover bands were using keyboards back then? Pretty much zero for the latter, maybe a handful for the former, and in those cases it wasn't going the John Carpenter route.   in what is obviously a delta-blues influenced genre   ...  Yeah, I can't even tell you how many times I've listened to Charley Patton and thought ""This totally sounds like Dopethrone."""

Metal,3e25e3,inugami47,2,Tue Jul 21 11:57:25 2015 UTC,"There's a huge difference between bands like them drawing on blues/rock versus metal bands actually going back to the ""Well my woman she done left me so I'm gonna jump in the river and drown"" source.

Metal,3e25e3,Sevenvolts,6,Tue Jul 21 15:50:40 2015 UTC,"I find Portal very relaxing.  I'm lucky enough that I can listen to music pretty much all day in work. It's an open office plan and I work beside an especially loud person. He is on the phone constantly (as part of his job) and he is practically shouting down the phone. For me it is incredibly distracting and sometimes I find all I can focus on whether I like it or not is his voice. I will be listening to whatever through earphones and I'll still hear his voice over the music, grabbing my attention. I'm not the kind of person who can just shut out his surroundings and tunnel vision on a single thing, I cannot turn off like that. I consider myself fairly sensitive to sound. In an open office with a lot of people doing a lot of different things, sometimes I can't block it out and I just hear everything, every keyboard clack and cough and voice and all the ambient noises in and outside. It's difficult sometimes.  Portal is so suffocating, so overwhelming and so dense that, loud enough, it will block out all other sounds. When I listen to Portal everything else shuts up and finally, I can fucking concentrate. By somewhat Pavlovian response, when I listen to Portal I feel calm and relaxed.  It's like a comforting hug."

Granted, if I'm really really exhausted, I can probably drift off with Nails playing in the background. . .but i don't know.   Something about that kind of weird discordant technical style I can really chill out to. Ulcerate works the same way for me (and not Destroyers of All either), and so does Abyssal."

Metal,3e25e3,x2mirko,11,Tue Jul 21 17:07:49 2015 UTC,"Jari has some serious guitar chops but my love of the band's music has SERIOUSLY waned over the years. It's very shiny, overproduced stuff that unfortunately for him, didn't really deliver on the promise of how it was going to sound. There are tons of other, better bands that make beautiful, cosmic sounding, cinematic metal that don't require the level of shit he wants to put into the recordings. I've just lost my ability to care anymore about what this band does."

He definitely knows what he's doing - It's well produced and well written. It's also very catchy. In that sense, it's good music. I can see why people like it.   That said, i don't think it's interesting music. So many of his fans talk about him like he's some crazy composing-genius. I don't see where that is coming from. It's not that i actively dislike it - I don't mind listening to it from time to time, e.g. if it's playing while i'm at a friends place or something. But there's nothing that truly grips my attention, nothing that makes this special. I don't see a reason to listen to it on my own."

Listening on an external speaker, you lose so much of the dynamic range and the riffs become muddy and indistinguishable. The car is better, because you can turn it up and make it more immersive, but the low end can be lost to the background noise of the car on the road, which in extreme metal can block out a lot.

On the other hand, non-extreme mostly falls into the categories of retro, like trad doom (some of which is still pushing boundaries and very favourable here, like Elder), speed or heavy metal. Or mainstream metal. Like American New Wave or Melodic death. Most.of which hasnt budged one iota since At The Gates begun both genres, so has been boring to us for a very long time.

That's inherently going to rely on an underground scene that I think itself is largely driven by black/death, and going back to your first point are more often the ones doing something new or interesting."
Metal,3e25e3,Dragovic,4,Tue Jul 21 12:46:00 2015 UTC,like american new wave   Stop that. It's not a thing.
Metal,3e25e3,I_Smell_Panties,12,Tue Jul 21 13:24:19 2015 UTC,Do you browse /new?
Metal,3e25e3,deathofthesun,11,Tue Jul 21 17:06:20 2015 UTC,"No it doesn't.  You only remember the times that things you don't like are posted.  My frontpage right now has black, thrash, death, doom, melodeath, avant garde, and traditional metal. That's without all the posts from yesterday about to pushed off by new submissions.  Also, the top post is about freaking Mastodon. And it was posted two hours ago. There are plenty of people who would agree with you but then they'd also be wrong"
Metal,3e25e3,I_Smell_Panties,7,Tue Jul 21 13:14:01 2015 UTC,Elitist. All of those obscure bands I don't know like Destruction and Nuclear Assault must be potato black metal bands who only release demos.
Metal,3e25e3,Dragovic,9,Tue Jul 21 14:39:47 2015 UTC,"they fooled you too  they are actually goregrind bands. Destruction actually goes by Anal Destruction and Nuclear Assault, Nuclear ASSault"
Metal,3e25e3,I_Smell_Panties,5,Tue Jul 21 15:24:57 2015 UTC,"What a coincidence, those are the names of my two favorite thrash metal themed pornos. Don't you dare try to tell me they're pornothrash or some other stupid porn subgenre. It's all porn."
Metal,3e25e3,Dragovic,2,Tue Jul 21 15:28:05 2015 UTC,it's like pizzathrash's retarded cousin.

Metal,3e25e3,deathofthesun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:55:39 2015 UTC,I know. I was surprised. I was going to post this band at first until I found them.  What else am I supposed to wear? How else will everyone know I'm a pornothrasher?
Metal,3e25e3,GoldenSundown,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:02:38 2015 UTC,And BukkakePizza-thrash is the fusion of the two?
Metal,3e25e3,deathofthesun,11,Tue Jul 21 16:12:59 2015 UTC,"No.  I get frontpaged every time I post power metal.  If you see a problem with the content, post more of whatever you want, and if it doesn't suck it'll get upvoted."
Metal,3e25e3,TylerTheOrc,8,Tue Jul 21 19:10:56 2015 UTC,Thrash is posted so fucking often I thought Sodom was gonna make the Blacklist last go round.
Metal,3e25e3,t_deg,10,Tue Jul 21 14:21:14 2015 UTC,if Sodom make the blacklist I'm flying to LA to punch dots in the dick and steal as many records as I can carry

Metal,3e25e3,GoldenSundown,8,Tue Jul 21 13:36:59 2015 UTC,What the fuck is it with this sub and figuring out my security methods before I can implement them.

Metal,3e25e3,Dragovic,8,Tue Jul 21 13:49:55 2015 UTC,Sick of what? People posting songs they like? I post a lot of Black Metal because I like it enough that I think others would too. And there are days where Symphony X and Nightwish make the top of the page too. What exactly would you have us do instead?
Metal,3e25e3,GreatThunderOwl,6,Tue Jul 21 16:27:38 2015 UTC,"I've noticed too, in my experience maybe 50% of submissions here are death and black. Doesn't bother me though since they are my favourite genres."
Metal,3e25e3,padsboltssaints15,2,Tue Jul 21 13:01:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, kinda. I'm not really a fan of Death or Black Metal, i'm more into Power, traditional, speed, etc. Though i understand other people like it, it seems most stuff here (or at least the most upvoted stuff) is Death and Black."
Metal,3e25e3,tobeornotobe,13,Tue Jul 21 12:47:47 2015 UTC,"That's probably a lot to do with confirmation bias and the fact that regulars here are more likely to be further along their metal journey (if you wish to view it that way) and are more liable to be into the extreme genres.  In saying that, they tend to get a tiny-medium upvote count but you'll get the more safer/entry level/more well know/etc metal getting posted with much larger amounts of upvotes (usually from lurkers/non-regular contributors)."
Metal,3e25e3,AveLucifer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:48:40 2015 UTC,"What songs make you want to move? I know that's a very general question, but I was just thinking about that earlier in regards to more danceable songs, and then tried to think of it in regards to metal songs. Like the songs where you sort of unconsciously start moving to, nodding your head to, etc."
Metal,3e25e3,Phantom_Pizza,11,Tue Jul 21 13:12:29 2015 UTC,Freezing Moon makes me want to move. Specifically to Norway to start a black metal band.
Metal,3e25e3,AveLucifer,3,Tue Jul 21 14:29:19 2015 UTC,A good d-beat can have a really nice groove that makes a nice circle/dance pit.
