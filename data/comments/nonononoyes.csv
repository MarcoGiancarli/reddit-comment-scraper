nonononoyes,3dyd8i,Snivelluslol,7,Mon Jul 20 22:12:41 2015 UTC,"It's a good bad-anime. You won't regret watching it, and even though (by most anime standards) it IS bad, I have NEVER spoken to anyone that had a bad thing to say about it. They will admit it's cheesy, but that's part of what makes it cool. The animation style is originally fairly close to the original manga style, which makes it somewhat acceptable since that's what most viewers would expect.    All said and done though, Initial D IS an anime. It does take too long sometimes for the story to move on. If you're REALLY into anime, you're gonna feel that part. If you're not, then you may find yourself being absorbed into the more soap-opera-ey parts of the storyline. I would like to qualify these silly parts actually make the anime. If you were to watch ONLY the ""battle scenes"" repeatedly, it's fairly boring without context.   ALSOOOOO : The above reference was to one of the many Eurobeat songs used as the soundtrack. Eurobeat is a slippery fuckin' slope, man. While I don't think anyone would describe Initial D as a ""guilty pleasure"", I believe I would most definitely categorize Eurobeat as such."
nonononoyes,3dyd8i,maeshughes32,6,Mon Jul 20 22:53:33 2015 UTC,If you are a car person then yes.  It is cheesy at times but the battles are really fun.  If you have no interest in cars then I doubt it would be entertaining.  Like JustLetMeComment said the animation is bad in the first few seasons but I still love those episodes.  Some of the best battles are from those seasons as well imo.

You may not proceed if your car is totaled. If you don't have enough money to repair your totaled car, you must get a loan and you will be in debt.

nonononoyes,3dqhxq,Tony8Bologna,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:48:48 2015 UTC,"We practiced a lot of things with training grenades. These are grenades that just make a loud noise when they go off, but are relatively safe.  For instance, on the first day of grenade training, the drill sergeants asked for a volunteer. One of the privates who was dumb enough to raise his hand was chosen. They shoved two test grenades into his LBE (load bearing equipment, carries ammunition and has spots for grenades), pulled the pins, and told him to roll left and right on the ground. Keep in mind, they didn't tell any of us that they were training grenades, and the only thing keeping them from going off at this point was a single piece of fabric on each grenade that was depressing and holding the spoon.  This oh so trusting private did as ordered, and the grenades eventually went off.  We did various training things and an obstacle course with these grenades. We were rated on our ""grenade skills"" on the obstacle course. There were tests like throwing grenades from one trench to another (perhaps a bit outdated these days, but hey), and using grenades to assault a bunker.  Then, one day, we went to the live range. Each private had to throw a live grenade. You could watch every other grenade go off after being thrown into the field. Yours, however, would be missed. There's an NCO (non-commissioned officer, eg. sergeant) beside you, and they WILL throw you to the ground if you try to watch it."

A six foot section of the hull got stove in, about half a foot in the middle.  Fortunately, it didn't breach, and it didn't hit on any of the frames, so it was mostly cosmetic.

All American armed forces have an enlisted  ranking system that starts at E-1 and passes to E-9 as rank is awarded (E stands for enlisted as opposed to officer or warrant officer).   An E-1, the lowest enlisted rank is know as a Private Basic in the Army and Marines.   E-2 is a private, followed by an E-3 which is a Private First Class.   E-1 through E-3 are all called privates when referred to informally. Ex: Private Jones, get over here.  But, formally Jones maybe a Private First Class and is titled as PFC Jones.   From there the Army and Marine rank split names and are no longer privates.   For the Army the rank is as follows: E-4 Specialist (or Corporal depending on unit) E-5 Sargent E-6 Staff Sargent E-7 Sargent First Class E-8 Master Sargent (or First Sargent depending on appointment)  E-9 Sargent Major (Or Command Sargent Major or Sargent Major of the Army depending on appointment)   For the Marines it goes: E-4 Jarhead 4 E-5 Jarhead 5 E-6 Prick Jarhead  E-7 Super Prick Jarhead E-8 Master Prick Jarhead E-9 Jarhead Prick of the Marines  Edit: forgot CSM."

For them, in that stage of the race, the ""fastest line"" is to stay safe and not crash out by landing on anyone or colliding midair.

nonononoyes,3dmq63,938moto,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:47:03 2015 UTC,at the professional level there is a sense of trust that everyone around you knows what they are doing and therefore mostly everyone in the pack will make it through cleanly. mistakes still happen but for the most part the top 10 riders are out there riding the same line throughout the entire race. this idea does not stand in the 250 C class at your local moto track.
nonononoyes,3dmq63,pdubs94,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:12:00 2015 UTC,"Amen to that. I still do see pros take it cautiously down the first one or two rhythm lanes if it's a short start that gets everyone bunched up, though.   My faster buddies always told me to race B class instead of C, even if I was dead last, just because it was safer. I was good enough to clear all the jumps on the track but lacked corner speed. Didn't listen to their advice and had a mid-air collision in my first race in C class."

nonononoyes,3dmq63,makeswordcloudsagain,5,Sat Jul 18 00:35:25 2015 UTC,"Finally something where I have relevant life experience.  I've ridden and raced bicycles and motocross most of my life. When I was in my tweens I raced BMX with a side car on a local BMX track. I rode on a circa 1978 Gary Littlejohn that looked a lot like this. I still have mine and if I get a chance I'll take a picture of it and post.  On a bicycle the are a called a sidehack. The passenger is called a monkey and you literally want a circus acrobat to be your monkey, light and nimble that understands weight transfer.  While I've never raced the motocross with a side car, I've ridden in one several times and been to many races. It is super easy to get wadded up in side car. They just don't react like you think they should. And if you go high side where the rear wheel of the bike gets lifted you can seriously get launched off the bike.  If you want some real pucker power watch the Ilse of Man TT Side car races. 180mph with your noggin millimeters from the ground.

nonononoyes,3dmq63,xixoxixa,2,Fri Jul 17 19:42:17 2015 UTC,Is it better to slow down before the jump in order to stay on the ground or to just be in the air longer?
nonononoyes,3dmq63,wwickeddogg,5,Fri Jul 17 19:44:16 2015 UTC,"Neither, really. It's fastest to clear the jump, but the less time you're in the air, the better. Slowing down so much that you don't clear the jump hurts your momentum, but the only time it's ""better"" to be in the air longer is if you need the airtime to clear a big jump and preserve momentum. The fastest possible line is the line that lets you preserve momentum AND stay low to the ground so you can get the wheels back on the dirt ASAP and start accelerating again."
nonononoyes,3dmq63,938moto,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:42:57 2015 UTC,"When you say ""clear the jump"" where is the optimal landing point?"
nonononoyes,3dmq63,wwickeddogg,2,Fri Jul 17 15:51:37 2015 UTC,"the backside of the jump. There is almost always a take off and landing, except for those occasions when the track designers are dicks/incompetent and they have you huck to flat."
nonononoyes,3dmq63,cawdrizzle,2,Fri Jul 17 17:50:52 2015 UTC,"It really depends. Generally, the optimal landing point is simply the point that allows you to maintain the most speed, so it's usually 1-2 feet over the ""edge"" of the landing; if you jump long, you're in the air longer, and tires spinning in the air don't do much good. You want to get back to dirt asap. However, it is faster to go 40 mph off a takeoff and land on the backside than it is to slow to 15, not land on the backside, accelerate, then catch air coming off the edge of the table.  Basically, the optimal landing point is the point that allows a rider to keep maximum forward momentum. Because motocross is a dynamic sport, that point changes often depending on the jump, other racers, etc.; sometimes, it's better to jump long/ ""overjump"" if the rider is skilled enough to keep his trajectory low and flat. Some riders will overjump one jump, land on the face of the next and sort of bounce off it over the next one; some riders will tag the very top of each landing. It all comes down to personal choice and physics.   On this jump, near as I can tell without context of the corners/obstacles before after the jump, the leaders in the gif are landing in the optimal spot."
nonononoyes,3dmq63,938moto,2,Fri Jul 17 17:52:26 2015 UTC,"Not really possible with a sidecar, but in normal motocross scrubbing jumps is a technique to keep the launch angle down to minimize air time."

nonononoyes,3diy9h,Cxameron,2,Fri Jul 17 01:02:49 2015 UTC,"Well, people a lot of people I know think that they pay attention on the road, but really all they do is pay attention to the car directly in front of them, and maybe glance in th rearview mirror every couple of minutes.   What you really should do is pay attention to the cars way ahead of you as well, like a couple 100 feet in front of you. If you see them braking, it's much easier to anticipate anything that the driver in front of you is going to do.   Also, when I drive, I constantly check the rearview mirror (at least every 30 seconds) to see if there are any cars coming up rapidly behind me (especially on a different lane on the highway), that way I know exactly which lane is safe to maneuver into should a dangerous situation arise.  The problem nowadays is that the driving permit is seen as a necessity (and it often is) and there's a lot of social pressure to to have it, be it your job requiring one, because taking public transportation would mean you'd need to start a bit later, the need to be mobile and the feeling of independence or simply your friends and family making fun of you for not having one.  This has lead to driving permits being distributed like candy, there are no in depth checks. If you fulfill the minimum and are barely able to drive, you'll get a permit. Then everybody counts on you getting enough experience quickly through driving so that you don't start killing people on the road. Especially in the US where you get the permit at 16.  What should be done to remedy this is (whenever possible) assisted driving, where you need to have an experienced driver with you for the first couple of years until you get your definitive permit. Alternatively you need to present yourself to a follow-up exam after 6 months where a qualified person checks your driving capabilities, then another one after a year.  Texting and driving should immediately lead to you losing your permit for a few months, I hate that shit!"

nonononoyes,3diy9h,daimposter,97,Thu Jul 16 20:29:38 2015 UTC,It would somewhat depend on what went wrong. Problem with your steering? Chances are you won't be able to get to the side easily. We don't know the circumstances so I am willing to give this man the benefit of the doubt and also say that the driver in the car that swerved around very well could have done something to warn the car behind him.  Either way I think we can all agree that some things could have been done a lot better to make it safer but the guy also did quite a bit more than most people would given where he is sitting.

nonononoyes,3diy9h,KrippleStix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:13:14 2015 UTC,"It would somewhat depend on what went wrong.   True. I'm just going by what I see. I don't see any marks on the floor so not a tire issue or an issue of the car stopping suddenly. If it's steering, you should still be able to move but just with more difficulty.  He's going at least 50mph and not much traffic so he had forced his car to the shoulder at that speed relatively easy.    We don't know the circumstances so I am willing to give this man the benefit of the doubt and also say that the driver in the car that swerved around very well could have done something to warn the car behind him.   Interesting that the car stopped in the middle of the road would get the benefit of any doubt and not the driver that swerved.  Based solely on what I see in the gif, they both probably messed up.    but the guy also did quite a bit more than most people would given where he is sitting.   Yeah, but it's hard to ignore how he got to that situation and didn't get to a shoulder."
nonononoyes,3diy9h,daimposter,6,Thu Jul 16 21:11:34 2015 UTC,"True. I'm just going by what I see. I don't see any marks on the floor so not a tire issue or an issue of the car stopping suddenly. If it's steering, you should still be able to move but just with more difficulty. He's going at least 50mph and not much traffic so he had forced his car to the shoulder at that speed relatively easy.   Fair point. I did not see that. Puts a bit of a flaw in my idea however we still don't know all the circumstances behind why he is there. Having now looked at the road I'd say it is pretty much a guarantee that he fucked up and should not be where he is.  The reason I gave him the benefit of the doubt rather than the driver is quite simple. We did not see the guy stop. We have no idea what happened before the gif begins and so we can only make assumptions based on what we do see. In the gif you can clearly see nobody that pulled around the van in front of the car in question. There were empty lanes on either side of him. He waited until he was actually quite close before he switched lanes. Its quite obvious that the van hadn't just stopped or the guy driving it would not have been behind the vehicle putting down the reflector. I don't see any reason the car should have switched lanes so closely to the van apart from the driver not paying attention to what is on the road in front of him. There was nothing blocking his view or lowering visibility. Makes me think that the person was distracted, an asshole, or doesn't understand or think about what the people behind him will see and have to react to."

I could be wrong as its been quite a few years but I think you are supposed to have them like 30-50 feet yards back or so? Even if someone is not paying attention if they hit it they may still have time to break or get into another lane rather than not realizing the person in front of you is stopped and not just driving slowly.  At least that is how I see it.  Edit: Feet and yards are not the same"
nonononoyes,3diy9h,KrippleStix,2,Thu Jul 16 19:34:53 2015 UTC,"I learned that you are supposed to put it as many meters back as the speed limit in km/h is. So 360 feet when the speed limit is 75 mp/h (120 meters, 120 km/h). 30-50 feet does jack when you go 50 feet in half a second."

At worst, it might be dangerous because of the speed difference because you were too slow in moving over, but frankly, you are better off risking an accident crashing to the right (or even left) then letting  yourself stop in the middle of the road.    If you do happen to get stranded, fuck it.  The only reason to leave your car is if you seen an opening to run for the side of the road.  Give up on the car or ""saving"" anyone.  Either a traffic jam will form, saving your car and preventing an accident by forcing everyone to slow, or it won't.  There is pretty much nothing more dangerous than being at a dead stop in the middle of a highway that is moving fast.  If that had been me and I somehow had been forced to a stop like that, I would  have been strapped in, hyperventilating, bracing for the inevitable impact, and watching the mirrors like a hawk for absolutely any chance to escape."

There is no reason to assume the broken down vehicle had any means of moving over to the side of the road. If there was a slow moving traffic pattern at the time of his breakdown it could have been completely impossible to move over.  There are far too many people in these comments assuming that he could have simply moved over. If he was able to, more than likely he would have.

This was before cell phones were common and a few cops just blew past me ignoring me.

Sometimes its on a curve and you don't know there's a stopped vehicle coming.

She was prosecuted and found guilty of criminal negligence causing death."
nonononoyes,3diy9h,tdogg8,53,Thu Jul 16 19:19:20 2015 UTC,That's a pretty broad generalization based on one case from Quebec.

Basically a truck driver stopped at night on the road to make a delivery/pickup. Put their hazard lights on and went off to do their stuff. A drunk driver crashed into the back of the truck and sued.  While it's worth noting that damages were reduced because of the drunk driver's own drunkenness, the court found for the drunk driver because you owe a duty of care to other road users and stopping on a road is inherently dangerous."
nonononoyes,3diy9h,CDanger,28,Thu Jul 16 23:41:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you. The lead Japanese case is much more messy and establishes a slightly different precedent regarding torts of negligence: Tokonashi v Honemitsu (1994) YT 33.3.64445.  Essentially, three young students are out looking for a waifu for their senpai (who they all secretly love) when suddenly the cat bus in front of them swerves out of the way, revealing that they are careening towards a tentacle monster. The monster has its way with most of them, and then goes to work on the cat bus —which is technically still a victim, despite also being legally classified as a vehicle.   In the end, they learn the value of friendship and defeat the tentacle monster with elf magic."
nonononoyes,3diy9h,OnionFily,3,Fri Jul 17 00:21:30 2015 UTC,"I found the point about owing a duty of care rather humorous. If the drunk driver had done so, we likely wouldn't be reading about this case."
nonononoyes,3diy9h,TheHYPO,36,Fri Jul 17 02:23:42 2015 UTC,"I know. I read extensively around that case, and I wholeheartedly disagree with the Court's decision (if the motorcyclist had come across a car stopped because of engine failure, or a piece of random debris, what would have happened?) It looked from all of the reading I did, like the motorcyclist was driving extremely fast and should have been able to see the car (it's possible that just like the OP's video, someone pulled out of the way in front of the motorcyclist and therefore the motorcyclist didn't see the car until it was too late... but that would imply he was too close to that other car.  In my view, the motorcyclist had an obligation to be able to stop his extremely dangerous (to himself) vehicle if an obstacle presented itself. It was very unfortunate, but WHATEVER her reason for stopping, I don't think she should have born the brunt (at least not the full brunt) of negligence. That said, what she did was very stupid, but understandable. Had she stopped simply to allow the ducks to cross without getting out to help, people would likely understand someone who was trying to avoid killing little ducks...   It's a horrible situation all around, but most of the online posters (particularly the motorcyclists) discussing the situation before the decision was rendered agreed it was the biker's responsibility to have been able to stop and the biker was almost certainly driving irresponsibly.  I also disagree with the sentence - what good is 90 days in jail going to do this poor woman? She is going to have a guy's death on her conscience for the rest of her life. She is pretty damned assuredly not going to stop in the left-hand lane to go help save some ducks ever again. I don't see what putting her in jail (a horrible experience and a costly one to the taxpayers) does for anyone.  All that said, when a cop stops traffic to let ducks cross the road, people love it and say that's an awesome cop. If no one had been hurt in this case, I suspect people wouldn't have been vilifying this woman for stopping traffic to save the ducks... I'm sure some would, but I suspect there would be some positive reaction as well..."
nonononoyes,3diy9h,abcdefgf,16,Thu Jul 16 19:27:47 2015 UTC,"Shit, first article I saw about that said she faced life. 90 days doesn't sound bad considering she directly contributed to the death of 2 people and (according to the judge at least) showed little to no remorse through out the proceedings."
nonononoyes,3diy9h,DrHGScience,5,Thu Jul 16 20:01:46 2015 UTC,"Shit man, I wouldn't show much remorse either. It was the motorcyclist ' fault after all."
nonononoyes,3diy9h,Brasillian,6,Thu Jul 16 23:31:09 2015 UTC,"A broken vehicle does not constitute negligence.  Duty,  beach,  causation and damages do. Idk about traffic laws there but, if you aren't allowed to stop on the freeway aside from emergency, then she had a duty to keep moving, which she breached."
nonononoyes,3diy9h,meninthemirror,7,Thu Jul 16 23:12:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think the woman's actions are really comparable to a mechanical failure of her car, or potentially dangerous debris in the roadway.    (1) Every one is criminally negligent who   (a) in doing anything, or  (b) in omitting to do anything that it is his duty to do,  shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons   Despite what you read online, and even what motorcyclists said online, the evidence presented in the case was that    A Sûreté du Québec expert who examined the scene of the collision estimated Mr. Roy’s motorcycle was travelling between 113 and 129 kilometres per hour    Now, that's a pretty big range on a 100 kph limit provincial highway. 113 km is ""won't get pulled over, probably getting passed frequently"". 129 is ""passing everyone, will get a ticket if a cop sees you"".   I agree that if noone got hurt, then people wouldn't be vilifying this woman. Even her lawyer pulled out this argument,   Mr. Labelle said while acknowledging what his client did “was stupid” but involved no ill will whatsoever.   But that's a red herring. Criminal negligence and dangerous driving offences don't require ill will. Criminal negligence only requires that the 'reasonable person' (reasonable driver in this case) could foresee the risks associated with the action.  Is stopping in the left lane of a provincial highway, in a spot with restricted visibility for upcoming drivers, a situation that has the foreseeable risk of causing an auto accident? That's the question the court had to ask. The points you raise about mechanical failure, and debris on the roadway don't really relate to the offence- they relate to potential defences for creating the dangerous situation. Having to pull over a car with a serious mechanical failure, and being unable to pull over safely onto the right shoulder seems like a species of necessity (Cp R v Fry, 1997- where a necessity defence was accepted for a driver speeding to escape a dangerous situation).   Stopping due to dangerous road conditions might fall under due diligence- that the defendant was trying to properly discharge the responsibilities of a reasonable driver.  But regardless of our personal feelings about ducklings, they don't have equal status with people in Canadian law. If she'd stopped so that a moose could cross the road, and then the accident happened, I think she could have a complete defence- a moose being in the roadway is a serious threat to motorists, and stopping to allow it to clear the roadway is a reasonable response to protect yourself from a dangerous situation."
nonononoyes,3diy9h,TheHYPO,8,Thu Jul 16 22:15:11 2015 UTC,"You missed my point. My point was that the biker had an obligation to protect his own safety and should have been in a position to stop... the reason her vehicle was there is immaterial to that discussion - if it had been a moose... a car that stalled... a fallen rock.... the result would have been the same - the biker would have hit an object he should have been in a position to avoid.  The fact that her choices put the obstacle there is not something I'm excusing, but I think people in wanting to see her go to jail for life was sorely disregarding the motorcyclist's obligation. I just don't see how jail does anything in this case.  I haven't read the details in probably close to year, so I'm not pretending to remember exactly what I read, but at the time I formed my opinion, it wasn't based on the trial evidence because there hadn't been a trial yet. There were tons of articles and reports from the accident investigators and things like that though. I think I remember the biker's speed range to have been cited as larger than that, but in any event, even at those numbers, the biker was speeding. No, a cop won't pull you over for 113, but if you do choose to speed, you have to bear the consequences of your action - if your speed contributes to an accident, the fact that you're speeding is relevant to your culpability.129 is certainly not slow.  He only managed to slow from 113-129 and slowed to between 105-121 after braking - that suggests to me that we're talking about a decal of less than 10kph (I assume the range is fairly even on both numbers - either 113 decal to 105 or 129 decal to 121 or similar) - so the guy had so little reaction that he barely managed to slow 10kph... I'm not sure if motorcyclists have to avoid a full ""brake"" - will that flip a bike? would a biker be trained not to do a full brake? Would reflexes have them fully brake anyway given the obstacle in front of them? I don't  know enough about motorcycles to answer that. it just seems like he was paying so little attention that he barely even had time to hit the brakes (like the guy in front of the cammer in the OP of this thread).  Apparently the wife, in testimony, indicated that ""[the husband] gestured to the accused as if to warn her it was dangerous for her to be there. Seconds later, his bike slammed into the stationary car"" - he shouldn't have wasted precious time gesturing - he should have spend that time slowing down or seeking and escape route. In fact, another lady who was a witness seems to have suggested that this was basically a similar case to the OP's video - she claims to have seen the car and swerved out of the way. Then she looked back in her mirror and saw the biker hit the car.  So maybe this lady (like the swerver in the OP's video) blinded the biker to the stopped car... but the biker was driving far too close to this lady to stop when faced with a stopped car (unlike the cammer in the OP's video) - it isn't made clear in any of the witness testimony I've seen, but I'd bet that's what likely happened - biker was following another car too close going to fast and when the car in front swerved to avoid the stopped car, he didn't have time to react because of how he was driving.  I'm not excusing the girl who stopped her car on a highway without hazard lights, but I think no one wants to give the biker any criticism for how he may have been driving. Unfortunately the early articles I remember reading are harder to find now that news about the conviction floods the searches first, so I can't really go back and see what the witnesses were saying at the time. We've also seen lots of examples where the evidence at trial isn't necessarily the whole story - depends how good a job each side's lawyer's do.  I note that ""His wife was following behind them at a slower speed and avoided injury"" - that's my whole point - yes she was behind, so that's probably a factor, but if he had been going the speed limit, maybe he would have had more time to react. The wife (who presumably witnessed the accident) didn't blame the driver for their death. That could be relevant or just her personality..."
nonononoyes,3diy9h,meninthemirror,2,Thu Jul 16 23:02:14 2015 UTC,"I agree the biker had an obligation to protect his own safety. But I cannot agree to your suggestion that ""the reason her vehicle was there is immaterial to that discussion"".  I briefly touched on it in my previous post, but the comparisons you made to mechanical failure or debris in the roadway are only relevant because they fall under recognized defences to criminal charges. The important thing about defences is that they operate when the person's actions constitute a crime as defined by law, but the particular situation makes it unjust to convict the person of the crime.   So yes, the result might have been the same (dead motorcyclists), but the process matters too. Stopping your car on a highway creates a dangerous situation, everyone agrees with that. But stopping your car for reasons of necessity or your own safety is entirely different than what happened in this case.  You get to the heart of it when you say    The fact that her choices put the obstacle there is not something I'm excusing   That is all the prosecution has to prove: per s219 of the Criminal Code, criminal negligence is an action/omission that    shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons   The s220  'Causing death by criminal negligence' only requires that the above standard is met, and someone's death resulted. If the standard is met, and death resulted, then per 220(b), life imprisonment is the maximum punishment.  Once the prosecution has shown the above, then defences are relevant. 'Helping ducks cross the road' is not similar to any of the recognized defences for charges of this level of seriousness.  Whether you think the law is right, wrong, or stupid, I don't see any justification for your initial statement upthread that    I wholeheartedly disagree with the Court's decision   What part of the law did they apply incorrectly? Was it the part about how her actions caused a dangerous situation, or the part about how death resulted from her actions? Or are you saying there is a defence that the court should have accepted? Those are the questions the court had to answer. Which of them do you think they answered incorrectly, or inconsistently with either the Criminal Code or the previous judicial decisions?"
nonononoyes,3diy9h,TheHYPO,3,Thu Jul 16 23:32:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying she didn't deserve to be charged with an offence...

I definitely don't want them to set precedence where this kind of crap seems acceptable.

nonononoyes,3diy9h,TheChance,5,Thu Jul 16 21:48:48 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge, where I live, the only way to be at fault when someone rear-ends you is to cause the accident deliberately, which I have to imagine is hard to prove. Otherwise, if somebody slams into the back of you, they are automatically at fault. In fact, there's a certain distance somebody with a manual transmission would have to roll backward down a hill, before it would be their fault should they catch your bumper. You're supposed to leave ample room between vehicles, and adjust your speed to permit you to stop short in the space you've got.  That's how it should be."

My state's drivers' manual says you should leave 1 car length per 10 mph. That's not nearly enough space to stop dead at highway speeds.  Google says an average car length is 15 feet, so following distance is 105 feet at 70 mph. Stopping distance is 3 times that.   Where did you hear you're supposed to leave 21 car lengths at 70 mph?  Leaving enough distance to react if the car in front of you panic stops is reasonable. Leaving space to stop if the car in front of you hits a brick wall is not so much."

nonononoyes,3diy9h,no1flyhalf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:10:47 2015 UTC,Oh I fully understand/agree. Sometimes you cant avoid having to swerve and the guy was following too closely to be able to stop in time. Just a shitty situation all around.

This is why you should never stop in the middle of the fucking road. If your engine dies, coast it to the shoulder. If you need to turn across the other lane; pull off to the side of the road and wait until both lanes are clear.  The road is for moving on."

Had the lady following given proper room OR been paying attention she would have been able to stop and NOT slam into the back of the car giving the driver bad whiplash and back injury. I was one of two people out of the twelve in the room that said that the lady who did the rear ending should have a good portion of fault. I said ""she should have given more space. You're supposed to give two car lengths or around two seconds, whichever is bigger."" and one moron in the room actually said ""well who actually does that?"" I was flabbergasted. And outvoted.

Another car stopped in front of it which hazard lights on to help get it off the road.   There were two cars in front of me and I could not see this at all. The first car ahead of me swerved, the second must not have been paying attention because he went straight into the stopped car. I had noticed the first swerve, eased over to see what was up, saw the situation and got over two lanes, barely dodging the car ahead of me as it hit the stopped car and flew into lane on the right.   Once I got home, I found plastic pieces of car in the cowl between my hood and windshield. It was that close."

She was riding so close (and so fast) to me that when I changed into the turning lane she had to swerve into the right lane without looking, as she almost slammed into the back of the car that was previously in front of me (who was stopped at the light).

nonononoyes,3diy9h,TheHYPO,10,Thu Jul 16 18:07:25 2015 UTC,"More traffic can sometimes be helpful in this situation. My throttle went into fail mode and died on the freeway which left me with no acceleration. If I used the brake to slow down and find an opening, I was forfeiting speed I couldn't regain. Fortunately there was so much traffic, people were only going 20 or 30 and I was able to weasel myself over to the shoulder. Also fortunately, in fail mode,  the throttle still allowed basically 5kph speed that allowed me to get from the last lane through to the shoulder. If that happened at full speed with a few cars flying by (like the guy in front of the dash-cammer in the OP, or the cammer himself), I could have easily been hit as I made my way over, quickly slowing down and the oncoming drivers still doing full speed didn't realize I was going much slower until too late.

It is Russia, MKAD (road ring around Moscow), 5 lanes in each direction, speed limit is 100 km/h, but there is no fine for speeding less than +20km/h, so a lot of drivers doing 115-120 km/h (75 mph). So, it's difficult to move to the shoulder in these conditions.  Russian road rules states that in case of an accident you must NOT move your vehicle before all parties agree on scheme of accident. In most cases drivers do not trust each other and choose to wait for police to draw the scheme. Also, 99% of accidents (even if nobody hurt and it's minor fender-bender) are processed by police arrived to scene. There was new rule introduced few years ago that if nobody hurt and damage is less than 20 000 rub (~400 usd) then drivers may not call police and exchange insurance details, but as far as I know, that is rarely used.  source: I drove on this road for many years and you can see 2-3 accidents like this every day there. Only 10% of drivers moved to shoulder before police had arrived.  edit: added gmaps link"

Yes, the orange triangles are for safety/warning but the way he was doing it was too risky especially in the middle of the highway!  Its a big risk thinking other drivers will drive safe.  The motto is drive assuming all others can't drive.  Also, it doesn't matter that the guy got stuck in the middle, as someone said what if there was traffic and the car died right there? Obviously ideally would be to get to safe a place but shit happens.  We don't know what exactly happened to the driver but he was dumb for being too unsafe.  Now he ran out gas or had a small correctable maintenance problem, that is his fault (I should check my car again and again) but others crashing into him is separate(although he is not 100% innocent).      /   The swerving driver is a curious case.  I won't place blame on the lane change and have nothing else to do right now, so: The only question is why did he/she swerve so late? Yes, it's hard to tell when it comes to slow moving traffic or stopped traffic but wouldn't the swerving driver notice that he/she was getting close too fast? It looks like the driver stepped the brakes at the last second. Okay, fine what if there was only slow moving traffic?  with the way the car was going it would have crashed into the back of the car in front. Imagine a different set of problems in that traffic situation, a car stuck ahead could have gotten into the left lane and both the swerving driver and stuck car could have collided.  Maybe the driver was checking to see if the left lane was open? but if the left lane was full... And that's without people outside like our situation here! While hard to tell, a shape moving object will make your mind think something is wrong since seeing a human is out of place in the highway(you are used to seeing cars) and add that easy to see orange color.  Also add that wouldn't your brain ask something is wrong by seeing all lanes being empty and your own lane is being really slow? As the driver would get closer it becomes pretty obvious what's ahead.  Also, in video cameras aren't objects closer than they look?  Yes I am overthinking the driver's actions, not really making him/her the super evil guy.     Short version:  stopped driver: shit bro!  swerving driver: not cool dude!  me: being hypocritical Op: title sucks"

You will learn the ins and outs of these machines and will be capable of fixing the things you inevitably break.   What I am flying in this video is called a ZMR250.

If the bartender doesn't even attempt to angle the glass, and the head is more than an inch high, I won't order another. I usually went to one bar, where the bartenders mostly knew who my friends and I are, and also knew our drinks. It's a rare thing in the U.S.   Now that I live in Brazil, where the servers actually pour the beer, it's a waste to even care about foam. They have weak beer that's barely a step up from bud light.   I miss seeing a perfect Guinness pour. Room temp and delicious."

On the east coast, you either go to a bar and get Budweiser that is just filled to the brim with no foam and beer spilling down the sides of the glass.

nonononoyes,3d10xe,i_seen,8,Sun Jul 12 17:01:53 2015 UTC,I'm not too sure of the rules here. Was the biker in the wrong here or the police car just didn't see him?
nonononoyes,3d10xe,up_the_brackett,9,Sun Jul 12 17:13:24 2015 UTC,"IMO, it's just kind of a mutually awkward moment.  The rider wasn't breaking any laws, but he was probably going a little too quickly compared to the speed of traffic. Most people aren't really looking for bikes passing on the right either.  The cop made an aggressive move to block off traffic and obviously wasn't expecting a bike to be there.   Seems like they both just scared themselves silly, no harm no foul."
nonononoyes,3d10xe,ixipaulixi,18,Sun Jul 12 17:22:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where this is, but in VA lane splitting and driving on the shoulder is highly illegal. I see riders getting tickets for it all of the time during commuter traffic."

nonononoyes,3d10xe,AwaisK,4,Sun Jul 12 18:42:28 2015 UTC,As a non-rider I'll take your word for it; cars are so unpredictable that if I did ride I probably wouldn't lane split.
nonononoyes,3d10xe,ixipaulixi,4,Sun Jul 12 18:55:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly the reason why you would want to filter through traffic as a rider. Filtering allows you to create a barrier between you and cars which would otherwise be approaching you from behind. Most drivers of cars don't hesitate to get their phones out or apply makeup at the first sight of a stop light or traffic, as a result bikers are more likely to get rear ended than if they were constantly moving through the traffic."
nonononoyes,3d10xe,AwaisK,2,Sun Jul 12 23:36:20 2015 UTC,"I think that's where the disconnect is for me. I drive 56 miles each way to and from work, and when I'm referencing lane splitting I mean guys who do it at 80+ through traffic."
nonononoyes,3d10xe,psycho_admin,2,Mon Jul 13 00:31:19 2015 UTC,"Those types of riders not only put themselves but others in danger, I believe the general rule of thumb is to not exceed 30mph when filtering through standstill traffic. However I feel like here in the UK we have less of these types of riders, perhaps it's because of our staged licensing process which filters out the bad drivers and also because both car and motorbike drivers are taught how to deal with filtering."
nonononoyes,3d10xe,Redbulldildo,2,Mon Jul 13 00:40:55 2015 UTC,"Last I checked lane splitting is legal in all but the US.  Or at least I haven't heard of any other countries other then the US that has it outlawed.    Studies have shown that allowing lane splitting actually helps reduce traffic jams and pollution.  Now with that said you often times see videos posted online of people lane splitting doing 40+ while in traffic that is barely moving.  At those speeds yes lane splitting is dangerous but it can be done safely.  When I have been out in California for every stupid lane splitter I saw, I would see 3-4 safe lane splitters.    Oh and one report I remember reading stated showed that a some accidents when dealing with lane splitting were caused on purpose by the car drivers.  The number one reason given was they didn't know lane splitting was legal so they were trying to stop the person from lane splitting."
nonononoyes,3d10xe,KhabaLox,4,Sun Jul 19 02:35:37 2015 UTC,It's extremely safe and that's why it's legal in most of the world.

Running red lights has become the norm, everyone has to wait 5 seconds for all the people running the light to get across before going. I've had two people I know killed on bikes because of this.  Everyone drives much faster than their skill allows too. I often see the flow of traffic going 90mph at night on the 405 and then people wonder why they can't stop in time when someone loses it up ahead.  Everyone follows each other way too closely for the speeds/conditions. Relating to my previous point, cars will just start stacking up when there's an accident because no one can stop in time. This worsens with rain, as apparently everyone in LA completely forgets how to drive when water falls from the sky.  /rant"
nonononoyes,3d10xe,twas_now,2,Sun Jul 12 20:49:26 2015 UTC,"Seems pretty synonymous to our traffic :P except most don't go as fast, instead they will literally be doing 20 kph on a 90 kph high/freeway causing people to slam on their brakes and pile up.  Red lights runners are pretty common but the worst is when someone is making a left hand turn in an intersection but they go after a red so they block all traffic going towards them until their traffic moves.  People merge without looking, take 20 seconds to go at a green light, though it doesn't seem as fast as what you've described, still very dangerous.   The reasoning for our problems (Anyone who calls me a racist has not seen ICBC) is that we have a privatized insurance company (yip, just one) that works with driving schools (which 100% are run by indians) that pass all Indians provided they pay them for the class which then the ICBC driving course instructors passes them knowing they took a 'driving course'. It's so corrupt that you can do ANYTHING to fuck up, and the instructor will still pass you, as long as you take a course. I went for my licence a few years back and had to take it 3 times (and I really am a fine driver) because of demerits that they made up, then told me I have to take a driving school to pass (I knew the instructor who passed me).  Kind of like how southerners are called racist for blaming crimes that were/are committed by immigrants, here, Indians are ALL bad drivers because of the pay-to-pass policies. Older Indian drivers literally have no idea what the rules are, they don't speak English or know how to read road signs and drive however they like.  There's no 'kind-of bad' drivers here, just the ones who were taught to drive and the one's who took driving courses.  p.s. just as a mini stat to back up how many people take courses and suck at driving, in my old highschool, out of our group of 6 close friends, 4 took driving schools and all four had atleast 2 accidents IN THE SCHOOL PARKING LOT in just months of having their licence, me and the other who were taught by our parents had none (two of the others also had another accident outside of the school parking lot)...  I'd say it's more frustrating to drive here than it is dangerous... nothing like getting hit, then the other driver drives off like nothing happens then ignores you when you signal to pull over cause they don't speak English..."

nonononoyes,3cxi3k,powertyisfromgun,173,Sat Jul 11 19:05:48 2015 UTC,Or perhaps the fact that it's wet.
nonononoyes,3cxi3k,RubyVesper,112,Sat Jul 11 19:10:24 2015 UTC,"Both of these factors combined are what likely lead to his very long slide across the ground.  Wet slide, heavy adult man, wet, smooth ground.    This is why most water slides have a very gentle slope.  It's a miracle he jumped in time, though!"

nonononoyes,3cxi3k,princessvaginaalpha,22,Sun Jul 12 04:29:31 2015 UTC,"Well it's a bone, it's attached to your spine, and good luck sitting in a normal chair without putting pressure on it. I wouldn't recommend it."
nonononoyes,3cxi3k,Hamsworth,8,Sun Jul 12 04:40:06 2015 UTC,My wife severely bruised her tailbone after the hammock she was sitting in snapped and she fell three feet straight down onto the concrete.  She was unable to sit comfortably for about two months.  It hurts a lot
nonononoyes,3cxi3k,diederich,2,Sun Jul 12 05:56:46 2015 UTC,My mom broke hers clean off and said it took almost 5 years to feel 100% normal again. Unfortunately it's not like you can really put a cast there. You just have to be careful and let it heal.
nonononoyes,3cxi3k,coldinalaska,5,Mon Jul 13 09:27:33 2015 UTC,"I merely sprained mine once, and it was impossible to sit without a special pillow. They say that if you actually break your tailbone, you won't be able to walk for a few days without narcotics to control the pain, and that every time you poop for the next couple weeks will hurt a lot because of the internal pressure it creates on your talibone as your bowels move and flex.  In short, bad stuff."
nonononoyes,3cxi3k,Cascadianarchist,4,Sun Jul 12 07:11:56 2015 UTC,"At the speed he was (probably) going, hitting that little lip of concrete straight into his ass at that angle would definetly break the tailbone. Feel your spine and follow it down to where it meets your ass crack, it's not like there's a good padding there. Your tailbone is essentially the ending of your spine, it's just not all full of important nervous system structures. But it's definitely pretty easy to break."

nonononoyes,3cxi3k,Thoraxe474,3,Sun Jul 12 02:10:30 2015 UTC,The concrete ones are the Seward (mini park) street slides and then I think the metal ones are in Bernal Heights. Other parks such as GG park have great slides too. My grandmother use to live in Richmond and some of those playground/parks have awesome slides. Oh and there is one in Berkley if you want to travel over there...I think it's in Codornces Park.   Tip: concrete slides use plastic of some sort. Like a plastic tray or plastic bin top. Metal slides use Pam sprayed cardboard/plastic tray(?) and maybe wax paper. Forgot how the wax paper works. Def use the googles for tips to make the slide more fun :)

You will see that it was shifted to non-vertical. But the panning speed was high, so we don't registered that in our brain i guess, giving the illusion a perfect perspective.

There is no way to know that a flame will burn you, unless you either get burned by it, or are told it will."
nonononoyes,3cvskf,piyoucaneat,15,Sat Jul 11 17:37:04 2015 UTC,"Depending on how old they are, children can't grasp concepts like that even if they are told.

They don't even really speak until they are that age, so explaining things to them is pretty fruitless at that point. But they start understanding even before they can really speak. And fire=ouch, is a pretty simple concept. This kid was old enough to understand quite a bit."
nonononoyes,3cvskf,piyoucaneat,2,Sat Jul 11 18:45:50 2015 UTC,He had two candles on the cake. I don't think you've ever spent any time around a two year old. You're making it sound like children are anything more than dumb noisy sacks of meat before they hit four or five.
nonononoyes,3cvskf,Akoustyk,-5,Sat Jul 11 18:59:51 2015 UTC,"Idk what comment you mean to be referring to, but in the comment I made, I was clear that the kid in the video would have been able to understand quite a lot."
nonononoyes,3cvskf,piyoucaneat,3,Sat Jul 11 19:19:27 2015 UTC,Right. And I'm disagreeing with that. At what age do you think it's okay to let a kid play around fire unsupervised after telling them fire is dangerous? I guarantee its not two.
nonononoyes,3cvskf,Akoustyk,-3,Sat Jul 11 23:45:55 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't let a kid that age do anything unsupervised. It depends on the kid also. Some kids, you tell them fire burns, and they understand, and won't touch it. Other kids are still curious, but they aren't gonna go and try to eat it, after you tell them it burns.   That would be retarded. Your experience with kids is that they can't learn learn anything until they are 4 or 5. My experience with them, is that they can very quickly learn to communicate, even way before they can say anything, with sign language, and they can understand a lot more than they can speak. By 2 years old, they are already being able to speak, not fully fluent speaking obviously, but still. ""flame=ouch"" is very basic.    If you would have had more faith in their abilities and sort of pushed them a little harder, not in a strict way, but just giving them credit, you may have had a different experience where you would have seen they are much more capable than you thought.   They could only learn from you. They will only learn as much as you teach them."
nonononoyes,3cvskf,DreaMTime_Psychonaut,0,Sun Jul 12 00:53:35 2015 UTC,"Being told everything doesn't build a curiosity for understanding. Sometimes it's better to let them learn, even if it hurts. The parents here protected him from lasting harm but he still learned a valuable lesson.  Edit: Let you children experience pain and steer them away from danger. There is a difference, and real learning only happens in between."
nonononoyes,3cvskf,Akoustyk,2,Tue Jul 14 06:59:06 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I first of all think curiosity for understanding or lack thereof is innate. I also know quite a lost of useless stuff about just about everything, so when I explain something to them, I cover many of the ""why""s. This could only increase a desire for understanding as it demonstrates how everything has a why, even if a lot of adults don't know it. But I would only do that when they are older and can understand more words.    There's no way I would let my kid put a flame in their mouth for a learning experience though. Go ahead and have learning experiences, but you will be able to trust me to keep you out of harm's way, if I can."
nonononoyes,3cvskf,DreaMTime_Psychonaut,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:38:17 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I'm just a kid myself and I won't pretend to know everything about parenting. But my parents coddled me and it certainly hasn't done me any favors. I'm fairly well adjusted but I think I would be a lot better off if they had given me some space
nonononoyes,3cvskf,Akoustyk,2,Tue Jul 14 15:57:04 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I think the duty of a parent is essentially twofold.   1- Keep your child safe and healthy until they are on their own.  2- train them to be ready to be on their own as quickly as possible.   If you coddle them too much, then they cannot be ready to be on their own. There is a big difference between teaching them as much as you can, and coddling them. And by teaching, I mean teaching truth, not telling them to do things simply because it is your belief. They are their own person."

nonononoyes,3cvskf,Korbit,3,Sat Jul 11 17:38:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The difference between stupid and ignorant is time and education. If you've never seen fire and get burned by it you're ignorant (not really your fault), but if you're a fire dancer and get burned you're stupid."
nonononoyes,3cvskf,Akoustyk,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:59:55 2015 UTC,"I actually think ignorant is more ignoring learning. If you just don't know something, I wouldn't like to use the word ignorant. But if you actively are not learning, if you know what I mean, then that's ignorant. To me."
nonononoyes,3cvskf,Korbit,2,Sun Jul 12 00:47:46 2015 UTC,That's a good point. Perhaps inexperienced is more appropriate.

All the kinds of things that instinctually draw a predator to a source of food. And of course, mommy and daddy always give them the best yummies so why would it ever occur to him that something dangerous might be within reach? That face after is the moment the kid realizes that his whole extremely limited world view has to be altered.  Some things that look yummy ARE painful, mommy and daddy CAN hurt him...  Watching your kid learn is actually the most interesting and enjoyable part of having a child. You get to see how truly amazing our developing minds are...your kid starts with nothing...nada, and suddenly he starts making these complex connections and gaining enormous skill sets seeming overnight and with very little help from you (at times). Language, social skills....it's mind blowing. And it's fun working out ways to help them along. I'm getting great at finding explanations for complex things that work within his experience. How do you explain why you can't go that far underwater? Well....you know how a blanket is heavy? Imagine having a few thousand blankets on top of you...it would squish you, right? That's how water pressure works.   It does suck trying to help them stay alive the first couple of years...but after that, they start to become less suicidal...and besides all the other stuff about them makes up for it.

You can free climb while protected by a rope. Free soloing refers to free climbing while not protected by a rope.   That being said, I disagree with your assessment. Free soloists are very careful about which climbs they are willing to commit to. Generally, a free soloist will know his or her limit very well, and only choose to free solo climbs that are within that limit. Adding the ""security"" of a BASE jumping chute encourages more risk taking. Taking a fall off a cliff with a parachute is considerably more dangerous than not falling."

I'm not condemning free BASE, I'm just pointing out that people are right when they say it's incredibly dangerous. Whether or not it's worth it is a whole other debate which I won't engage in. BASE is already one of the riskiest sports there is, adding the free solo aspect just magnifies the most dangerous aspects of BASE jumping. It does no good to say, ""well but it's safer than free soloing without the parachute!"".  People need to be well aware that the price you're gambling with is death for any mistak in sports like BASE and free soloing. Dean knew that and accepted the risks, and BASE killed him."

Unsafe BASE practice hurts the whole community. Every time a BASE jumper dies it makes it that much more difficult to open up access for recreational jumping, and pushes bad legislation that much closer. That's why special considerations should be taken to be as safe as possible BASE jumping, especially in public places like Yosemite.   I think Dean was a great guy but he showed pretty blatant disregard for the ethics of climbing and BASE. This post sort of sums up that idea. He didn't care how his death would affect anyone but himself, and that's the problem with lots of BASE jumpers. It's easy enough to say, ""I'm aware of the risks and it's my life to gamble"", but when you choose to push the limits beyond what you're capable of every other BASE jumper pays, and someone has to go clean up your body too."

The blissful feeling of relief afterwards is caused by endorphins, which are secreted as a response to adrenaline. They can give you quite a high. These people tend to get high levels of adrenaline, and therefore also high levels of endorphins. You get endorphins from physical activity too, that's why working out generally helps with depression, and why workout addiction is a thing.  Another fun fact: endorphins are so named because they work the same as morphine. Hence ""the body's own morphine,"" or ""endogenous morphine"" - endorphin."

It took a ton of practice to dial in the corrections so that you didn't death spiral the helicopter simply flying between A and B.  They were touchy and not forgiving at all.  Landing and all that took a lot of skill.  If you spent hours on empty servers practicing helicopter skills though, they were amazingly nimble.  You'd eventually spend entire games dodging parked cars and flying the gunships upside down.  I had a game with 4 kills in a transport helicopter solely from hitting guys with the skids."

nonononoyes,3cva8w,edahpuss,4,Sun Jul 12 09:01:14 2015 UTC,"That looks like a dedicated turn lane. I believe the car intended to turn left there.   I know what you're taking about regarding the car up ahead, and there isn't exactly a left turn there for him (looks like fields) but the car that got hit isn't moving in a way to avoid a head on collision in my opinion. They simply didn't see the pedestrian until it was too late, then once they slowed down the dump truck side swiped them. They shouldn't have made that turn, though."

nonononoyes,3cr31i,hurdur1,117,Fri Jul 10 02:27:38 2015 UTC,"When I was 11 or 12ish I was playing with a driver golf club I got from somewhere and another kid, unbeknownst to me, wanders up on my right side and I clobbered him on the backswing. He fell completely unconscious and I thought I had actually killed him and started screaming and sobbing. His hair was soaked in blood. After a few seconds he got up and ran home bawling. They took him to the emergency room and shaved his head and gave him several stitches but otherwise he was okay. I felt absolutely horrible even though it really wasn't my fault.   Another time me and some friends were playing with a plastic boomerang and I slung it and noticed on it's return path it looked like it might hit my friend that was about 20 yards in front of me. I screamed ""WATCH OUT"" which caused him to turn to look catching it right in his forehead. Sliced his head wide open right at the hairline. Ugh."

nonononoyes,3cr31i,PeanutButterAstroguy,36,Fri Jul 10 11:28:04 2015 UTC,"This one is even better.   Me and this kid were walking down the sidewalk when I happened to notice on the other side of the street there was money in the gutter (or where the curb meets the street). Like an idiot I say ""Hey look. There is money over there"" and he races off towards it. I barely beat him there and put my foot on it. It was a $10 dollar bill. He decides he wants it and pulls out his camping pocket knife and tells me he is gonna cut me if I don't take my foot off of it, and he was supposed to be a friend. I thought, yeah right until he starts poking me in the leg pretty hard with the knife. Not enough to cut though.   So, I take my foot off of it and he grabs it up and runs off. I see there is a flattened soda can in the street and this was back in the '70s when they were still made of tin and not aluminum. I pick it up and hold it vertically and throw it as hard as I can just trying to get it to hit near him and scare him or let him know I was at least retaliating somehow and it immediately takes a high wide arc to the right so I figure it as a bad throw.  It catches air and curves back and catches him right in the head while he is still in a full run and about half a block away. It was beautiful. As soon as it hit him it knocked him off his feet and he took a header but got right back up holding his head and wailing and continued to run home.   It was in the afternoon when this happened and I was afraid to go home as I knew I was gonna be in big trouble but I had to be home before the street lights came on so I go home all upset knowing what I am gonna be facing. My parents and his had already been in contact about the whole thing and my dad was furious until I told him the story of what really happened. Of course (the other kid) had a completely different story sans pocket knife and being the complete victim but another kid had seen the whole thing and my dad called his house and talked to him and he backed me up.   The next day we went over to the kids house and my dad got him to confess in front of his own mother that he did try to stab me with his pocket knife so all I got was a stern talking to about how that way not the way to have handled it and I had to apologize. The other kid ended up getting his head shaved and a bunch of stitches as well."
nonononoyes,3cr31i,Suicidal_Ghost,26,Fri Jul 10 12:24:47 2015 UTC,"This reminds me:  Back in about 1987 or so I had been kicked out of my home by my parents, (Hawaii), and moved to live with my Aunt in Ringgold Louisiana. I got a job at a Chicken farm there. The chicken houses were huge and had a total of about 8000 hens and a few hundred roosters per house. My job was to pick the eggs out of the hen boxes and put then on a suspended tray that slid down the middle of the houses.  In one house there was this one hen that would always jump onto the suspended tray and peck the eggs on the top of it. When she broke the eggs, it would drip down onto the eggs piled below it and eventually coat 30 or 40 more eggs. I would have to use sandpaper to sand the egg off of the shells before we could ship them and it added hours to my work.  So one day I was ready for the bitch. I saw her jump on the cart and, from about 30 yards away, I winged an egg at her. I immediately knew that my aim was off, but that egg curved in mid air and came in fast and hit that bitch right in the head.   I knocked her completely off of the cart and she hit the ground kicking and shaking like crazy.   All of the other hens and roosters ran in, and they ate her right there on the spot.   Most fucked thing Ive ever seen.  Chickens are the devil.   My boss asked me a few days later if Id see the hen that pecks eggs and, of course, I told her nope."

But I possess the vivid recollection of practicing archery at a summer camp and, after loosing an arrow at a target, only then noticing that some other kid had run into the line of fire to collect other arrows.  The kid, turning to face me, was struck directly in the chest by my arrow.  My presumption now is that my arrow had very little power behind it, and/or was tipped quite bluntly, as the arrow simply struck him in the chest and bounced off; the kid was fine, though a bit freaked out.  Nevertheless, for the briefest moment, I was frozen, traumatized, truly believing I'd just killed him.  It was a good shot, though."

nonononoyes,3codm3,ThePlanckConstant,0,Fri Jul 10 13:17:13 2015 UTC,"Alright, alright, I'll give you that the usage of ""socialist"" varies internationally, and the implications it carries.  Generally, in the USA, while it's a changing paradigm, when people of my parents age discuss ""socialism"" they're actually discussing communism and the oppressive qualities that communist implementations carry in those countries.   Do I agree that it gets tiring when everyone's out to make shock-art? Sure, but that doesn't mean you should respond by being pedantic, it's easy enough to walk into any art museum or gallery and be surrounded by classical talent and skill.  Art is art, traditional or nontraditional, and putting it in quotations is what leads me to think you weren't informed of the beneficial faucets of expressive freedom. Just because it's not your preferred art doesn't take away the potential value. Could we argue semantics about performance art? Sure, but either way, some pretty good classical sculpting skill went into the cake itself, so it's got you on both art interpretation methods. =P Plus, there's the consideration of the art to cooking itself!  Either way, we have a saying, ""I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it"" - Beatrice Evelyn Hall, an English writer - and I think it's important we maintain that attitude towards art as well as speech. Expression is expression, and as long as it's not infringing on others, let's have it!"
nonononoyes,3codm3,MNRailTracer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:49:30 2015 UTC,"The problem I have with this kind of art, often produced by state founded Konstfack, is that it's often abusive and destructive in the name of ""art"".   This is one of their art productions: https://youtu.be/iJfb5jyIlKQ  An other infamous case involve a girl student faking a psychosis, calling medical services and then fight them till she forces them to restrain her. This got applauded, founded and promoted by the state.  I don't like state produced art. I've gotten tired of them using tax money on it, and I've gotten tired on them forcing it in public places and state media. We have what they call a ""cultural elite"" with all too much power. This is a problem in some socialist states (if you allow us to call ourselves socialists).   ""I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it""   Absolutely, but that does not mean that it needs to be supported and broadcasted by the state. Here is an other case of ""free speech"" being preformed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP5uUqz4SHk&ab_channel=aizrtv (same artist but not supported by Konstfack this time)"
nonononoyes,3codm3,iagox86,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:13:02 2015 UTC,"Mmmm no, I don't believe that psyching out legitimate medical services is art. Their right to produce art ends where my rights to emergency medical services begins, and I think you're right to call it abusive in respects to that service.  If a state is going to sponsor art, I think it needs to be an equal-opportunity type situation. Have several artists propose an idea, get a committee of citizens to pick one they like, and go from there. When you get one person, even an elected official, making all art sponsorship appointments, that's a bit less socialist, and certainly lacks any smack of community involvement.  Again, I'm all in favor of someone in a movie theater yelling ""Fire!"" and going to jail despite their protests of free speech and artistic expression. Their rights end where other peoples' begin, and it's identification of that border that's important.  I see Konstfack is Swedish. I'm no art critic, my realms are technology and medical science, but I'd be curious about the international art communities opinion. I doubt that even the most abrasive of liberal arts here in the US would expect to walk away unscathed from punking our EMTs."

nonononoyes,3cjriv,Arc-arsenal,3,Wed Jul 8 22:49:27 2015 UTC,"He was never convicted of anything and even had several authorities sign off on it.   On 22 July 2006, Agis installed Dreamspace V at Riverside Park, Chester-le-Street, the second of a three-part tour of Britain. The following day, echoing the events of 14 years previously, the artwork left its moorings, soaring 30 ft (9m)[6] into the air before colliding with a CCTV pole, killing two people and injuring 13 others.[7] Following the incident, Durham Police seized the remnants of Dreamspace and launched a joint investigation with the Health & Safety Executive.[8][9]  Vandalism was immediately suspected; the artwork had been slashed with knives two weeks previously.[10] While foul play was not completely ruled out, other avenues were also explored. Another theory was that the warm air on the Sunday had caused the artwork to become a ""hot air balloon"". The structure had undergone safety checks by a Chester-le-Street health and safety committee made up of police and fire service experts before it had opened to the public.[11]  On 29 November 2006, Agis attended a police interview at Charing Cross police station where he was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter. He was released on police bail, pending further enquiries.[12] A statement was issued indicating that it would be summer 2007 at the earliest before the investigation was completed.[13] Agis was due to answer bail on 3 September but this was extended to the end of November.[14]  On 13 February 2008 Agis was charged with gross negligence manslaughter.[15] The trial began on 26 January 2009. Agis was convicted of a breach of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 but the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the manslaughter charge; a few days later the Crown Prosecution Service announced that there would be no retrial, no evidence was offered against him and formal not guilty verdicts were returned. On 26 March 2009 Agis was fined £10,000 for the health and safety offences. On 12 August 2009, this fine was reduced to £2500 on appeal.  Agis died two months later on 12 October 2009.

The artist then died two months later...  In 2011 the council and the event organiser were sued by the husbands of the women who lost their lives.  According to Wikipedia, a previous work of the artist left its moorings in 1986 and injured 5 people. How tragic that lessons weren't learnt then."

nonononoyes,3cjriv,cooleymahn,6,Wed Jul 8 19:09:48 2015 UTC,"Ok daft question coming straight out of the uk, why are they covering the pitch? Unlike cricket they aren't restricted to one ball for 80 overs so if it gets wet it's jot a problem, the ball doesn't bounce so the state of the ground isn't an issue, they all wear studs so slipping isn't an issue.  Is it just because they don't want to get wet?  Seriously. What's the reasoning?"
nonononoyes,3cjriv,bigmanlythreesome,20,Wed Jul 8 19:33:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how it is in cricket, but in baseball, the infield is dirt and quickly turns to mud. That makes it pretty dangerous to play around in."
nonononoyes,3cjriv,CDNChaoZ,2,Wed Jul 8 21:16:10 2015 UTC,"Please excuse my ignorance, the bits if baseball I've seen don't really Involve much running, anywhere. It's mostly pitch and stike outs.  I can see how it could be an issue if there was loads of running, especially to first base, but otherwise it seems like a lot of just standing around."
nonononoyes,3cjriv,bigmanlythreesome,19,Wed Jul 8 21:27:37 2015 UTC,"Well, in addition to the baserunners, the infielders need to run/leap to get to line drive and ground balls. The baserunners also need to often slide into bases and having dirt is a level of safety and predictability. Mud, on the other hand, is unpredictable because it can either increase your slide or suck you in.  [Edit: Here's a quick example of infield play]"
nonononoyes,3cjriv,CDNChaoZ,6,Wed Jul 8 21:31:04 2015 UTC,"Virtually all scoring in baseball involves somebody doing a series of flat-out sprints from one base to the next, and evnetually to home plate. You're right that it's a small % of the game, but it's actually the % of the game that's most critical since that's when the scoring happens. Baseball players are actually pretty good sprinters because of this.  I was at a game last night that had a really dramatic play that turned the whole score of the game around, and I was commenting to my friends afterwards how weird it is that everybody is so stationary for so long and then all of a sudden everybody is FLYING around the bases at top speed. It's a pretty dramatic change in the action!   In addition to that, the infielders do some pretty rapid twisty moves as they scoop up a ball from the ground and spin to throw it in some other direction. They can do these acrobatic leaping moves in the process. I'd imagine mud would impede that as well.  And then there's sliding into bases. ICK if that were mud...  Anyway they're actually super finicky about the quality of the dirt. They rake it all once during the game, too."

Possibly even turning to face the fall so you can run out at the end or roll if you're feeling especially stylish.

nonononoyes,3cfm6i,ThereIsAThingForThat,4,Tue Jul 7 20:25:52 2015 UTC,"Whether or not bikers should be treated better has nothing to do with what I'm saying. I'm addressing a probable reaction to such an annoyance. If the goal is to remind drivers to not be assholes to bikers, then being a forced and unnecessary inconvenience to the drivers probably isn't the best way to convince them.  Let's say the parade reaches two shitheads and one saint (and judging by everyone I've ever met on the road, I'm being very conservative with the shitheads). The saint now pays more attention, the shitheads now care even less for bikers. That is a net loss for safety."
nonononoyes,3cfm6i,amedeus,2,Tue Jul 7 18:53:30 2015 UTC,"I agree, but in the end it's kinda ""screwed if you do, screwed if you don't"" deal. You have to bring visibility to the fact that cyclists are treated terribly by many drivers, and that's hard to do without inconveniencing drivers (many of whom will otherwise not care), but by inconveniencing them you're pushing some of them further away.  Hopefully increased bike infrastructure will help out and make everything less tense between bikers and drivers."
nonononoyes,3cfm6i,ThereIsAThingForThat,6,Tue Jul 7 18:56:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I get the idea and that bikers should be respected more; I live in LA and most of the time I drive and ride my motorcycle for my commute, but I've ridden my bicycle before and I can see the disrespect and disregard that many drivers (ESPECIALLY LA) have for cyclists and motorcyclists.   But I see a fundamental difference between the two, and that is that while the general consensus amongst motorcyclists is that it is a dangerous world out there because of asshole drivers, it's also up to them to drive extremely defensively and take responsibility for their own safety. Constantly looking for paths of egress, keeping a buffer between them and other cars,  and especially avoiding cars that are harassing you and just speeding away or letting them past,  whatever leaves you not dead.  But as far as cyclists,  I have a huge problem with the too common variety that exists here, and these are the ones that blow through red lights without even checking to see if a car is coming,  weaving in and out of traffic lanes and 1) slowing down traffic (yes, inconveniencing other drivers) and 2) creating an unsafe situation for themselves and for other commuters.  Just a few weeks ago I was driving home late, almost midnight,  so the streets were clear. I was driving along Sunset, an arterial street that goes from Downtown LA to PCH, and out of a small side street at least 100 cyclists blow a red light and jump onto Sunset, taking up both lanes and at one point they surrounded my car. No signal, no acknowledgement of me driving, nothing. I think one girl held her hand up in like a half assed ""stop,"" the same kind that you'd give someone who was interrupting your conversation. I didn't even try moving because I was afraid I'd hit someone (and at the time I was driving a tiny ass Corolla). It's groups like these that piss me off.  Individuals do the same. There have been times where cyclists have tried lane splitting the first and second lane. Dude, I respect your rights, just take up the whole slower lane if there is no bike lane! I'd rather slow down and go around you than have my asshole pucker everytime you weave close to my car.  I get it, motorcyclists still have the advantage of speed over bikers, and I get it, fixed gear/road bikes were built for speed and are not easy to brake. And you're absolutely right, cyclists have rights, but there's still a LOT of asshole cyclists that fuck it up,  in groups and individually. But cyclists need to maintain a mentality of respect as well as defensiveness. A lot of people had the right of way and got killed."

Which is what most cyclists do as well, but that's not the ones you remember. The ones you remember are the shitheads, just as the motorcyclists people remember are the shitheads, and the car drivers people remember are the shitheads. I could tell you about a shitton of motorcyclists who drove like assholes, but I probably couldn't tell you about how many drove like normal people.   But as far as cyclists, I have a huge problem with the too common variety that exists here, and these are the ones that blow through red lights without even checking to see if a car is coming, weaving in and out of traffic lanes and 1) slowing down traffic (yes, inconveniencing other drivers) and 2) creating an unsafe situation for themselves and for other commuters.   Which is solved with proper infrastructure. Even then, ""slowing down drivers"" (by which I assume you mean ""Riding in the middle of the lane"") is many times the only choice other than ""wait to be sideswiped or hit by turning traffic"" when you have to ride on roads with motor vehicles.    It's groups like these that piss me off.   At the same time, I've seen groups of pedestrians do the same (usually during protests), but nobody would ever say ""Pedestrians are terrible!""   Individuals do the same. There have been times where cyclists have tried lane splitting the first and second lane. Dude, I respect your rights, just take up the whole slower lane if there is no bike lane! I'd rather slow down and go around you than have my asshole pucker everytime you weave close to my car.   And when they take the lane they'll have a shitton of drivers really, really angry at them. Lane splitting (assuming they're doing it in stopped traffic, and aren't doing it during moving traffic, which is a death wish in itself) is pretty much a defensive act against being rear ended. I've seen enough idiots on their phones driving straight into a car in front of them. If that had been a bicycle instead they would most likely have been killed.   but there's still a LOT of asshole cyclists that fuck it up, in groups and individually.    The same could be said for motorists. Putting the blame on the group does nothing.   But cyclists need to maintain a mentality of respect as well as defensiveness. A lot of people had the right of way and got killed.   Something that's only possible with the proper education and mentality. When you're surrounded by aggressive traffic, you tend to become more aggressive as a response. And honestly, you can drive as defensive as you want, but that doesn't help you when the idiot talking on the phone don't care to look in the blind spot on their right turn."
nonononoyes,3cfm6i,ThereIsAThingForThat,-3,Tue Jul 7 20:17:48 2015 UTC,"Cyclists ARE lesser people on the road. They don't pay any tax to use the roads as cyclists. People driving cars pay fuel taxes and tolls to use the roads and registration and auto taxes in some places. Car drivers should rightly feel more entitled to the road than cyclists. Doesn't mean they should run someone down, but cyclists need to get off their high horses. Once we get a cyclists tax I'm all for getting them dedicated lanes or sharing the road evenly, but until then cyclists should deal with being second class citizens."
nonononoyes,3cfm6i,1237894560,3,Tue Jul 7 20:26:10 2015 UTC,"Almost all cyclists already pay taxes to use the roads, because a vast majority of them also own cars. If anything, the cyclist should get a tax rebate for being on the road because they chose to ride a bike rather than drive their car, resulting in decreased wear for the same trip. Furthermore, since road wear increases with the fourth power of axle weight and a bike weighs so much less than a car, that decreased wear is significant. And this just covers the one positive externality of decreased road wear.  In order to support a cyclist road tax, you would have to show that spending and negative externalities as a result of increased cycling and cycling infrastructure combined outweigh both the tax already collected from cyclists for road maintenance and the positive externalities related to cycling such as (but not limited to) decreased road wear and carbon emissions."
nonononoyes,3cfm6i,DarthMolybdenum,2,Tue Jul 7 23:09:20 2015 UTC,"I'd agree to a cyclist tax.  Then, of course, they should get a rebate for how environmentally friendly their mode of commuting is, I mean, there's less taxes on environmentally friendly cars most places.  Then we should no longer allow property taxes to be spent on roads, since it should be paid for by the users.  I would bet on car taxes going up if they were no longer allowed to use property taxes on roads, even if cyclists had to pay a tax.  Edit: I nearly forgot, the taxes should obviously be done so it shows how big an impact the particular vehicle has on the road, so while a bike has little to no impacts, a truck would pay a bigger share, and 18 wheelers taxes would go up enormously."

I'm all about surprises and wild moments and crazy public art. I'm also a bike commuter btw. This parade was extremely poorly planned. Intersections should have been closed and weren't; all participants in any parade must always be able to halt at any moment (this is Parading 101 tbh), and this guy clearly wasn't able to halt safely; there should NEVER be maneuvering through moving cross traffic as this guy was doing; height limits should be checked beforehand and clearly were not; and there should never be anything that could fall onto passersby and hurt them (if this guy had fallen he could've seriously hurt somebody).   You can get away with this kind of shit at Burning Man, where everybody in attendance has signed waivers and knows what they're in for and where a death or serious injury or two a year is considered normal.

They protect from a very specific kind of injury scenario which is practically non-existent for the vehicle he's riding here.  He'd have to wear a motorcycle helmet (which poses other risks like limited visibility, or not being able to ride under the bridge he went) or a custom-made helmet to be truly protected."
nonononoyes,3cfm6i,H2instinct,11,Tue Jul 7 20:12:01 2015 UTC,"They protect from a very specific kind of injury scenario which is practically non-existent for the vehicle he's riding here.   They protect from a blunt-force head injury, which is far more likely on this bike than a regular one.   They don't protect against (and can even exacerbate) twisting neck injuries, but those happen when you impact the pavement at a high horizontal speed and at a low angle, which is unlikely here.   They also cause drivers to pass more closely, reducing their effectiveness; this obviously isn't a factor in this case.  The most likely injury for this guy would be a near-vertical fall to the concrete, which is exactly the kind of impact a helmet is likely to help with ."

nonononoyes,3cb2t9,negative_noise,34,Mon Jul 6 15:51:38 2015 UTC,"These are older (70s - 80s) Formula Fords. This event was run under the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) sanction under the class ""Club Ford"" which is specifically for older Formula Fords which are no longer competitive against modern Formula Fords. In the SCCA they actually don't call them Formula Fords anymore, but rather, Formula F since the modern popular engine is actually a Honda Fit engine. The traditional Formula Ford engine is a Ford Kent engine that is more than 50 years old. In Europe and Australia the Ford Kent has been replaced numerous times by other Ford engines, thus keeping the Formula Ford name, but that just hasn't happened in the US for one reason or another.    The easiest way to know if they are Club Fords vs a modern Formula Ford is the outboard suspension. The coilover is outside the frame of the car in between the suspension arms. A modern Formula Ford has a pushrod in the place of the coilover suspension and the coilover is inboard.  Formula Ford is a great place to start open wheel racing. There are no wings or other aerodynamic devices. Everything is mechanical grip. It will teach you how to drive and engineer a car since it has all proper racing equipment like an advanced car (fully adjustable suspension - dampers, springs, roll bars, ride height, rake, etc), but at a cheaper cost.   This was at a racetrack in Ohio called Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course during an event called ""Duffus""."

Obviously there are cases of drivers dying because of the open cockpit, most famously Henry Surtees. It is extremely rare, but I wouldn't blame anyone who did want a roof over their heads.  On the flip side of things, there is a lot more energy in a crash involving a tin top. A formula ford is a full tube frame chassis, so it is very sound in a crash. The only thing lacking would be the anti-intrusion protection that you can get with a carbon tub, but it is a very rare occurrence just like an injury to the head."

His teammate (Jenson Button) that accidently straightened him up went into the gravel immediately with fatal engine damage.  It's kind of sad because Alonso and Button are both signed to McLaren who have started a new engine partnership with Honda this year. Being a works team is no small task, especially for an engine provider to start from scratch when the other providers had a one year head start last year. So far McLaren Honda has been an absolute disaster and two of the fastest and most respected drivers on the grid have been forced to retire from most races with mechanical drama."

They are actually pretty incredible. The sport is hard to follow, and relatively boring from an interest in the outcome of the race perspective, but if you ever get the chance, general admission is easily worth it, just to see how incredible those machines actually are.

nonononoyes,3c5471,ThanksForFlying,11,Sun Jul 5 00:24:18 2015 UTC,Part of it is being on the edge. As skill is gained finding the edge becomes increasingly more challenging. Staying close to the edge gives the rush.

The inverse could also be true.  Personally speaking when I got my first road bike (was an avid mountain biker before) the problem was confidence.  I had the cardio capabilities but I didn't know how to use them on the new equipment and I didn't yet feel like the bike was a part of me (carbon bikes are harder to get a feel for initially if you've had heavy bikes all your life).  As soon as I had the confidence though, I really started to push the envelope on certain parts of the ride.  The confidence probably did lower adrenaline production but that in turn caused adrenaline seeking behavior too....at the moment there's nothing like a descent at 50mph...."

Most people are sure that I am close to death every time I tie in, but the numbers say it is safer than driving in the highway to and from the climb.   Mountaineering and wingsuits are truly dangerous, and the danger is part of the reason people participate. This is usually not for adrenaline, but to get to a flow state. This is similar to a zen state that is really amazing.  I suggest you read up on it, as it is possible to achieve without risking your life, and it is a really amazing experience."
nonononoyes,3c5471,MoonMountain,16,Sat Jul 4 22:58:10 2015 UTC,"I checked Wikipedia for flow state and its exactly what I expected. In other circles its know as being ""in the zone"", and it is an amazing feeling. I used to get it sometimes very strongly when freestyle rapping (which is funny 'cause we called that ""flow"" also). It was really cool, there were a few specific times I remember where I closed my eyes and I could see the words scrolling down in front of me like the opening of Star Wars, and all I had to do was read them along to the rhythm. There were multiple sentences already premade up that I could actually see, that I hadn't consciously thought of yet. Amazing stuff.  I also still get it sometimes when I'm playing trumpet, playing certain video games and working on business projects. Soon I'll be getting back into MMA training and can't wait to feel it there."

That's how it went for me, hip hop gave me my proper introduction to jazz and learning jazz taught me how much of hip hop came from jazz. It's basically just another extension of the same form, which is just improvisation with culture splashes. And really, I think its just the improvisational aspect in general, being forced to act in the now without getting caught up in overthinking that creates the flow state.   And thinking about it now, overthought seems to be the biggest barrier to the flow state.

nonononoyes,3c5471,kensai11,2,Sat Jul 4 23:55:52 2015 UTC,"Good question, and one that is hard to understand the answer to (or it was for me anyway) without experiencing it.   One reason is people decide they like one version of achieving flow better than another. Another is the risk and skill component get you to flow quicker. Some people only know how to get into flow through risk, and those kind of people usually don't go read psychology books to figure out the why behind what they are doing. They just go bigger and bigger because they can. Until one day they can't. Either way, most of these guys really don't want the adrenaline rush, because that means something has gone terribly wrong, and they are probably about to die.

At the end, if you're lucky enough to get to reflect, you're going to look back.   Some people are going to look back and see a lifetime reflected in the glow of LCD monitors and plasma screens.  They'll have that feeling some of us get when we look out our window after a long night of gaming, see the sun coming up, and try to remember what they did with the last ten hours.  Except instead of the last ten hours, it'll be their whole life.  This guy is going to look back and see that he flew.  It may not be the risk that you'd take, and that's okay too.  But there's beauty in it, and I wouldn't take that away from him.  He rolled the dice and earned it.   Best case scenario: you get a gif people will look at for 5 seconds and forget.

Something like 1 in 60 jumpers will end up dying from BASE jumping, and for professional jumpers (i.e. who jump a lot more than others), the rate is higher.  According to this article:   A 2012 study of BASE jumpers reported that 72 percent of jumpers “had witnessed death or serious injury of other participants in the sport, 43 percent (of) jumpers had suffered a signiﬁcant BASE jump injury, and 76 percent had at least one ‘near miss’ incident (an incident which would most probably result in serious injury or fatality but was avoided)...""

nonononoyes,3bup04,ToddlerTosser,2,Fri Jul 3 04:24:03 2015 UTC,I have no idea what's going on... I already used to think I didn't understand baseball and this was able to make it worst.
nonononoyes,3bup04,ReiBob,6,Fri Jul 3 00:18:01 2015 UTC,"What they were trying to do: (Here is what it looks like when it works.)   Guy on second (#28) and guy on third (#11) both start running to the next base before the pitch is thrown. Batter ""bunts"" and hits a short, slow ball that doesn't even make it to the pitcher. Pitcher or catcher has no option but to throw it to first base and get the guy who it the ball out. While this is going on the guy on second runs to third and the guy on third runs home and scores. It's called a suicide squeeze.   What actually happened.   Guys start running to next base. Batter misses ball and catcher now has it. Mets pull classic Mets maneuver and make everything worse.   Basically the guy on second (#28) started running to third and never stopped. The guy who was on third (#11) started running to home plate and then turned around when he saw the catcher had the ball. Both guys ended up at third base at the same time. Normally when this happens, both runners stand on the base, get touched with ball and the one that was there prior to the play is safe with the other guy being ""tagged out."" However, the guy that was there first (#11) ran past the other guy (#28) and toward the outfield. They started discussing were they both ""on"" the bag even though one of them wasn't, did he actually run ""backwards"" or just overrun and which one/both should be out. I've never seen it before, I'm sure someone has. End result, #11 was out. It hurt my head just as much as I'm sure it hurt yours watching it.  Unless you were wondering why that random guy asked his friend to taste his milk in that clip, in which case I have no idea."
nonononoyes,3bup04,mesenteric,0,Fri Jul 3 00:55:14 2015 UTC,What is suppose to happen at step 3 is half the story. The other half is if the catcher or pitcher do not throw it to first resulting in bases loaded. Depending on the next batter or two might be favourable to leave bases loaded in this case.
nonononoyes,3bup04,simcowking,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:39:27 2015 UTC,"That is one possibility but not a true suicide squeeze by my book, just a good bunt. I only think it counts if the runner is out so that the other runner/s score. That's just my opinion though."
nonononoyes,3bup04,mesenteric,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:16:48 2015 UTC,True if they don't throw him out then it's not a suicide bunt. However the runners could have expected a suicide bunt but the pitcher and catcher decided they wouldn't allow it

Baseball players love to really sell a tag. This looks like bringing the glove down to where the tag would be made then yanking it back like you just slapped him so hard with the glove your hand must bounce back.   It looks very emphatic and like a tag must have been made. Plus, if you actually missed the tag moving your glove away quickly makes it harder to notice where you actually put the tag.  Here it bit him in the ass. Certainly a teachable moment. Theatrics belong in the theater and not on the field."

nonononoyes,3bup04,mortal_rombat17,3,Thu Jul 2 16:39:17 2015 UTC,Worst game ever.  Keith Hernandez was so audibly frustrated watching it that it was kind of hilarious.  The Mets would be on like a 20 game win streak if they could hit the ball.  Just wasting amazing pitching.

nonononoyes,3bup04,XavierSimmons,137,Fri Jul 3 03:47:30 2015 UTC,The most unique aspect is that the umpire made the right call.
nonononoyes,3bup04,beansncornbread,27,Fri Jul 3 04:22:05 2015 UTC,The guy sliding into the base has to touch the base before the guy touches him with the ball (or hand that's holding the ball).  They guy with the ball had plenty of time to tag him but the guy sliding into the base moved around enough that he kept missing him.  Should have been an easy out but he's safe.
nonononoyes,3bup04,gnualmafuerte,25,Thu Jul 2 21:27:47 2015 UTC,Baseball sounds a lot like calvinball.

nonononoyes,3bup04,dudleydidwrong,6,Thu Jul 2 22:54:09 2015 UTC,"The baseman should have kept his ball hand down by the runner's feet and tagged a shoe.  That is what the baseman started to do, but it looks like he decided to levee the feet and tag a leg.  Then he changed again and went for the chest.  Meanwhile the runner's feet touched the base.  If the baseman had just keep the ball down he could have tagged the feet."
nonononoyes,3bup04,n0wl,10,Fri Jul 3 00:30:13 2015 UTC,"The runner is sliding to the base to secure his position onto base, the baseman with the ball (in his glove) is attempting to tag him out which will advance the game and reduce scoring opportunities.   As he's sliding he pulls his leg up to avoid being tagged in the leg/foot.   The baseman then makes a mistake by attempting to tag the runner in the chest. Which at that point the runners feet have continued to travel forward resulting in him being on base.   The baseman made a mistake in reaching up and away from the base, which is where the runner is committed to going to by going for the slide. The runner made a wise play by pulling his leg up, avoid the easy tag.   Every one is giving the umpire flak because game officials always get flak. He did make the correct call, and it is my opinion that this would be an easily mistaken call."

nonononoyes,3bup04,Monroevian,2,Thu Jul 2 23:04:07 2015 UTC,So why did he touch the base?

nonononoyes,3bup04,SmugglingGrapes,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:29:19 2015 UTC,"Your confusion seems pretty valid to me because there are two ways to get the ""out"" on a base.  Sometimes the baseman needs to touch some part of the runner with the ball or glove, while the runner is not in contact with the base.  Other times it is sufficient for the baseman to touch the base itself, with any part of him including his foot, as long as he has the ball, before the runner reaches the base.  I'm quite sure the latter is the case when the runner has just used the bat and is aiming for First Base.  It may also be the case when ""bases are loaded"" (e.g runners on first and second bases means the third-base defender can just tag the base if the ball gets to him there first).  But I haven't actually been on a baseball diamond for thirty years so someone else prob knows better."

If a runner is ""forced"" to move, then all a player has to do is touch the base with a part of his body while holding the ball to get the ""force out."" In this instance, there was no runner behind him.   There was no force out, so the runner needed to be tagged with the ball to be called out. The third basemen dun goofed."

nonononoyes,3bst61,Korbit,4,Thu Jul 2 14:05:59 2015 UTC,No. Never do this. Handbrakes are commonly used to initiate a drift/power-slide as it locks the wheels and breaks the traction that they have with the road. If you are in an emergency just use your brake pedal and if you are stopping too fast the abs will kick in and help you slow down.

nonononoyes,3bst61,iamtheowlman,5,Thu Jul 2 06:34:50 2015 UTC,"I always try to correct this error when I encounter it.  I had a friend whose brother was seriously injured in an accident because they wanted to ""practice using the emergency brake to slow the car... just in case"".  The only problem was, he decided to practice this on I-95 in New Jersey, and was driving a vehicle where there was no handle to release the brake, you simply stepped on it a second time, a little harder, to make it release.  He applied the brake, intending to take it off again right away, but couldn't figure out how, came to a halt right in the middle of the highway, got rear ended by a semi, and has been in a wheelchair ever since.  Its primary purpose is simply to keep the car from rolling while parked, should the transmission (manual) pop out of gear.  (Had a Saab with a busted motor mount that would pop out of gear and start rolling if you nudged it hard a few times)  It's also great for keeping the strain off your drivetrain when parking on a slope.  Much easier to get an automatic out of Park on a hill if you apply the parking brake before putting it in Park, and take it back out of Park before taking the brake off.  It's surprising how many drivers are unaware that you can do this.  Edit: Link to a driving school lesson about using the parking brake"

If you pull that shit on hard at speed you'll be lucky if you don't spin the car around as the back wheels lock up.  I'm not sure how automatics do it as here in the UK we all drive manuals, but here you push a button in on the end of the lever and it allows you to control the pressure on it. If you just yank it, it gets stuck on a ratchet and you have to push the button in and pull up a bit before it will go down to stop it from catching on the ratchet.  I can't imagine ever being in a situation where I'd pull it on when moving other than my brakes failing, but if you did have to I'm certain you'd want to hold in the button and pull it gently and gradually to prevent a spin."
nonononoyes,3bst61,makeswordcloudsagain,2,Thu Jul 2 19:50:17 2015 UTC,"In the US there often isn't a lever such as you describe.  More common is a small foot pedal, close to the door, and a recessed handle (similar to the inside handle you pull to open the hood/bonnet) to release it when it ratchets.  Also found, though not as common, is the type that was on this vehicle, which is the small pedal alone.  You step on it to apply it, and step on it again, harder, to disengage it.  My friend's brother didn't know about that type, and pulled the hood release, thinking that would release it.  And yes, he did wind up spinning and was struck on the passenger side door by the semi and pretty much folded in half, sideways, around the shoulder belt, snapping his spine."

nonononoyes,3bst61,hopopo,5,Thu Jul 2 13:53:33 2015 UTC,My '65 Mustang used to do this as well.  Wasn't because of not setting the parking brake but rather the gear selector not going all the way into Park.  Partially fixed that by taking the cover off the gear selector and allowing more room to throw the selector handle.  Also began obsessively applying the parking brake though I wasn't as obsessive about taking it off leading to some embarrassing moments.

Apart from that, this climb is substantially shorter and something like five full number grades lower than what Honnold has been doing. To give you an idea, I could fairly easily step up something of the difficulty in this video, but even with the benefit of a rope and gear, I probably wouldn't be able to get up most of the stuff that Honnold is doing un-roped."

nonononoyes,3bn6kw,Enthused_Llama,30,Wed Jul 1 04:41:28 2015 UTC,So that's what those weird nets at my internship were.
nonononoyes,3bn6kw,CoolGuySean,78,Tue Jun 30 18:22:17 2015 UTC,No those were probably just your average intern nets. Interns often try to run away once they realize they're just being used for free* labor so people often have a lot lying around just in case.  Edit: Wow I accidentally wrote cheap instead of free.
nonononoyes,3bn6kw,rackemrackem,35,Tue Jun 30 18:30:48 2015 UTC,I always thought intern nets were used for porn.

nonononoyes,3bn6kw,bagboyrebel,2,Tue Jun 30 18:45:56 2015 UTC,Interns get paid all the time. If someone does actual work for you(as is the case with many modern internships) you legally have to pay them.
nonononoyes,3bn6kw,Kizombeiro,2,Wed Jul 1 06:07:10 2015 UTC,Not really. In Software Engineering interns are often paid $35-40 an hour.
nonononoyes,3bn6kw,college-cashier,10,Tue Jun 30 18:59:12 2015 UTC,That's more than most software engineers out of college...?

nonononoyes,3bn6kw,college-cashier,2,Tue Jun 30 23:20:02 2015 UTC,I still don't know ANY company off the top of my head that will pay ~80k a year for an intern. That would be ludicrous.   edit: Googled it. They made 20k in one summer. That's fucking ridiculous.
nonononoyes,3bn6kw,Kizombeiro,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:01:54 2015 UTC,Yeah Google interns will make ~25k in cash. But they also provide housing. The housing is worth way more in a place like NYC (they put you up in luxury apartments).

nonononoyes,3bkg8l,ByeMiceElf,19,Tue Jun 30 04:46:44 2015 UTC,"He was taunting, he could have shot it way before the puck skipped."
nonononoyes,3bkg8l,irishdude1212,27,Tue Jun 30 04:57:10 2015 UTC,"this is not true in the slightest. (the 'taunting' part)  he was going for a lay-up, but hockey version. the safest shot you can possibly take. it was a divot in the ice causing the most freak movement of the puck to hit it, and literally bounce over his stick when it simply should have stayed guided by his stick and in."
nonononoyes,3bkg8l,Rhysing,10,Tue Jun 30 06:25:06 2015 UTC,"He wasn't taunting per se but he was being cute with it that stick handling was unnecessary, a shot from right in front of the crease is more of a layup because something like this could happen. I remember Stefan got ripped for this for weeks after it happened and sportscenter showed it a million times from all sorts of angles.   Nobody really cares to remember Dallas came back and won it in OT though and it was just a regular season game."
nonononoyes,3bkg8l,illuminati_by_nature,9,Tue Jun 30 14:42:04 2015 UTC,"But it's not the safest shot you can take for that reason - which is why there was something wrong with Stefan.   Any NHL player with a shred of confidence shoots that puck from 15ft out and nails it in the center of the net. If you skate it in, you suddenly introduce new risks - Bouncing pucks (as seen here), tripping and falling, or a player catching you from behind and knocking the puck off your stick."
nonononoyes,3bkg8l,Chili_Palmer,-2,Tue Jun 30 11:37:05 2015 UTC,"Nahhh, you take it as soon as you can make it for this very reason.  Hockey is fast and unpredictable,  if you have a clear opportunity, you take it (especially on an empty net)"
nonononoyes,3bkg8l,ShureYnaut,-13,Tue Jun 30 08:28:13 2015 UTC,"Bullshit. The puck was already going in, no need to for that little forehand-backhand deke he did."

nonononoyes,3bkg8l,Duderino732,3,Tue Jun 30 17:09:09 2015 UTC,Eh. He was simply moving it forward. There was no taunting or likewise - a freak movement of the puck.
nonononoyes,3bkg8l,NielsB90,2,Tue Jun 30 07:28:13 2015 UTC,"It's entirely his fault because he was being lazy as fuck in the way he was controlling it. That happens, you're not supposed to lose it."
nonononoyes,3bkg8l,DrDerpberg,33,Tue Jun 30 15:51:52 2015 UTC,"to be fair, if the quality was even close to watchable, or there would have been a reply showing what happened, the puck actually hit a divot in the ice, and bounced over his stick when he had it lined up to guide it in. hardly the fault of the player at all. he, yes, could have been quicker on the reaction, but this is such an unordinary thing, that it happening is once in literally a million. ig: video you just watched."
nonononoyes,3bkg8l,Rhysing,10,Tue Jun 30 06:24:48 2015 UTC,"Right, but the point was that any normal NHL player has been playing hockey their whole life, and knows that can happen.  He had a clear shot from 15ft out, 99% of NHL players would just flip the puck into the net, not skate it in to push it across the line because it's less risky - there is no NHL player that can't make that shot 1,000,000 times out of 1,000,000 with no pressure on them at all like that."

nonononoyes,3bkg8l,JarlMundane,5,Tue Jun 30 04:53:49 2015 UTC,"A team can pull their goalie for an extra skater. This usually happens late in the game when the team is down by a goal or two.  A team would also pull their goalie during a delayed penalty. This would happen when team A got called for a penalty, like tripping for example. Team A would then need to take control of the puck for play to stop and for the penalty to begin, but as soon as they get control of the puck, play is stopped. So when Team B sees that Team A has been called for a tripping penalty, the goalie can skate to the bench for an extra skater, and Team B really doesn't have to worry about Team A scoring a goal with the net empty because as soon as Team A takes control of the puck, play is stopped. So unless Team B scores an own-goal, they have no fear of getting scored on with their net empty."

nonononoyes,3bl4ob,MEatRHIT,14,Tue Jun 30 07:12:05 2015 UTC,"This is mostly luck though. Of course it is easy to critique from the keyboard, but the driver should have:   Aired down the tires Driven much slower at that start Not gassed it after the first bounce Hit reverse, or at least neutral once the front was up. Holding the brakes, made things worse."
nonononoyes,3bl4ob,mdegroat,10,Tue Jun 30 16:42:57 2015 UTC,at least neutral once the front was up   Seriously just letting off the brakes would have brought the nose down.

nonononoyes,3bl4ob,Kimpak,11,Tue Jun 30 08:33:40 2015 UTC,You should get into wheeling then.  So many butt-clenches every trip.  Pic for proof :/....I'm still in the driver's seat...
nonononoyes,3bl4ob,MattyB4x4,2,Tue Jun 30 15:07:38 2015 UTC,Just out of curiosity; in a setup like that how damaging is a rollover?  Can you just flip it back upright and keep going or is it time to open the wallet and garage?
nonononoyes,3bl4ob,sistom,2,Sun Jul 5 11:09:04 2015 UTC,"In this particular situation, I got another rig to flip me back over and we kept wheeling late into the night.  I lost a little bit of oil, but that was it.  Flip it back over, fire her up.  It's a toyota based buggy that runs off propane, so I don't have to worry about fuel leakage either.  If they stay over longer, you can get oil down into the cylinders and you can do major engine damage, so you just pull the spark plugs, turn it over a few times, pop them back in and go.   If you go over backwards, or roll hard, you can bend tubes, wheels, axles, etc.  That's when you drag your rig back to camp, load up and head home.  Every major component has some sore of protection.  My radiator is behind me so it's protected, I've also got a full cage around my engine...and passenger compartment).  It's amazing what some good planning during the build process can do."

Driving at 70 mph in a 60 zone traveling 60 miles you only save 1.16 minutes. 10 over saves 1 minute of 60 minutes of driving. Not worth driving like the fucking cunt that he was.

nonononoyes,3bidyt,The_Game_Geek,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:35:50 2015 UTC,"I think it was your speed x 2? If you go 60 km/h it takes 120m to fully stop, etc... I might be bullshitting but I think I remember hearing this once from some guy who taught about roadsafety"
nonononoyes,3bidyt,SetFireToTheRane,7,Wed Jul 1 01:37:23 2015 UTC,Maybe for a car but not for a several hundred/thousand ton train. At 55 mph (~90km/h) it would take over 1 mile (1.6km) to stop according to a quick google search.
nonononoyes,3bidyt,pezdeath,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:47:52 2015 UTC,"It is actually a function of your speed squared.  Couldn't tell you the specifics without knowing about car and road conditions.  120m at 60km/h seems high though.  Maybe if it is raining.  For a train though it will take much longer, as was said."

Just because you omit the antecedent doesn't make it magically wrong. It just breaks convention, which in certain contexts is perfectly allowed. This isn't the AP; it's a thread title. Spoken English omits the antecedent all the time, and it is perfectly valid.  In spoken English, the person being referred to is immediately apparent. The title is assuming that you didn't look closely at the person enough, and told you to look closer. Because they are wrapped up in clothes, the gender is unclear.  That you advised someone to say 'his or her legs' is proof enough that you don't know how to edit for style. English is not an ESL textbook."

You can make lots of slides where your feet have a decent amount of friction, you just have to balance it with some counter force. Usually by putting one foot a bit forward and putting more of your weight on that one. You can make am upright slide without falling that way on ice, mud even gravel (not good for your shoes though).

nonononoyes,3b6vn4,darzinth,17,Fri Jun 26 21:14:57 2015 UTC,"I was a pro stuntrider all though my 20s, this is called ""Skitching"". He uses titanium plates instead of steel to give those brilliant white sparks.   At night, titanium plates spark as bright as a welding arc. It's very difficult to photograph. We put titanium bolts on anything that's gonna scrape the ground like a 12oclock bar, it's the biggest crowd pleaser. I would drag my titanium 12-bar over a puddle of gasoline and the sparks would ignite it.   Side Skitching is considered the easiest motorcycle stunt to learn. You don't need plates, you can do it in regular shoes. Both feet are off one side and your body weight is on your chest on the tank. Here's some side Skitching from the worlds worst movie Biker boyz http://youtu.be/DERds8rPSi0"
nonononoyes,3b6vn4,sexpanther50,5,Fri Jun 26 17:58:43 2015 UTC,Wow. That movie looks terrible.
nonononoyes,3b6vn4,machzel08,3,Sat Jun 27 04:30:11 2015 UTC,I looked for some titanium I could attach to my shoes but always had a hard time. Is there a place to buy a plate? Or did you just use bolts attached to your boots
nonononoyes,3b6vn4,TrippZ,6,Fri Jun 26 19:56:10 2015 UTC,"I used to buy super thin titanium plates online like 4""x8"" ($20) and would bolt them to steel frame which would then strapped to a shoe.  It was a colossal pain in the ass to make and to ride with. You can't stand and maneuver around the bike with anything on the soles.   Keep in mind that you can't bend titanium without breaking it, you have to heated with a torch to bend it. If you try to force it to bend it will shatter.    Titanium bolts are like $6 apiece on eBay  If I were to do it all over again, I would buy a dedicated pair of boots, and put titanium bolts all through the heel."
nonononoyes,3b6vn4,sexpanther50,4,Fri Jun 26 21:31:55 2015 UTC,"Damn, thank you for the answer.  How would you do the bolts?  just a shorter thread and have some drilled/tapped holes in the heel?"
nonononoyes,3b6vn4,TrippZ,2,Fri Jun 26 21:44:01 2015 UTC,"Yea man, id probably experiment with cheap steel bolts first to get a feel for the whole thing before you committed to the expensive titanium bolts. Get some thrift store boots and drill a big ol 3/8"" holes in the heel and get nuts and bolts.   I'd use big washers on both sides, that bolts gonna get hot quick and maybe melt the bolts so they slip out.   Maybe put an extra insole on the inside, it's gonna be painful maybe impossible to walk in.   The metal wears down shockingly fast."

nonononoyes,3b6vn4,Razorray21,18,Fri Jun 26 14:25:44 2015 UTC,Not really. Only reason it would flip backwards would be if it hard accelerated. Which you can't really do when you can't reach the throttle.
nonononoyes,3b6vn4,Totally_man,6,Fri Jun 26 14:28:10 2015 UTC,as long as he pulls parellel to the ground the bike cannot flip... because physics
nonononoyes,3b6vn4,ZaccatFour,2,Fri Jun 26 14:46:58 2015 UTC,"Actually no; for the bike to flip, the net torque about the rear wheel would need to be ""backwards"" (counterclockwise if the bike is facing to the right), which is totally possible if the rider pulls hard enough.   To put it another way, if you had a rope parallel to the ground tied to a 1 million kg mass (say an office building) at one end and the rear of the bike the bike would flip over backwards because the net torque would be unbalanced.  Tl;dr: the direction of the pull is only part of the physical reason for the bike to not flip. The biggest reason for the bike not flipping is how small of a pull the rider is creating while being dragged (metal on asphalt has a pretty low coeffficient of friction)."

nonononoyes,3b2lae,medianbailey,3,Thu Jun 25 15:04:59 2015 UTC,how bad is it for the tracks to be practically submerged in sand like that? seems like a great way to ruin every gear in there.
nonononoyes,3b2lae,yoweigh,4,Thu Jun 25 16:39:33 2015 UTC,"In sand? no problem at all. The only time you really need to worry about the rollers and what not are if you're working in mud (if you leave it in the under carriage it could dry and cause something to lock up or break )and in the winter time, you absolutely have to clean the tracks of any dirt / mud at the end of the day or it will freeze in place and then you can have problems."
nonononoyes,3b2lae,habitualbastard,4,Thu Jun 25 17:48:26 2015 UTC,"Actually loose sand is one of the hardest things on undercarriage components. It basically works like sandpaper, wearing out the rollers, tracks, and track rails much, much faster than most other mediums. All of those are considered wear ithmmems, but I wouldn't be surprised if track life was reduced by as much as 50%.  Edit: items*  Apparently my phone suffered a bit of a stroke while typing."
nonononoyes,3b2lae,LikeNobodyBidness,3,Thu Jun 25 17:53:25 2015 UTC,"yeah, it isn't exactly good for the tracks and rollers etc. but they wear out rather quick anyway due to task they're given daily.

Afterwards they have to take very long breaks as their bodies have pretty poor cooling systems. Expending that much energy so quickly in that kind of environment causes a spike in body temperature.  This is why you see the Cheetahs just chilling out sitting down after their failed chase.

Because she has a great picture of her sticking her head out of the a sunroof of an SUV, and there is a cheetah on the roof maybe 2 feet from her. The guide told her the Cheetah's have learned that they can stand on some of the vehicles, but that they wont bother anything attached to the vehicle because they see the vehicle and anything attached to it as an animal that is far to large to be prey. He also told her to make sure to not climb too far out of the vehicle though, lest the Cheetah realize that she was a separate organism that might just taste like chicken."

nonononoyes,3ap548,majoroutage,43,Mon Jun 22 18:29:33 2015 UTC,"Somewhat related.  I was very young and planning to go on a road trip with some friends during my sophmore year in college.  We decided we should leave very early in the morning on Saturday to avoid traffic.  The night before we packed up, and then sat around and had some beer and passed the time in other recreational ways.  The next morning we got up later than we thought we would, so we literally jumped in the car and set off driving ... maybe we just threw on some fresh clothes and brushed our teeth.  But the car was packed, so it was literally like pile in, open the garage door, and go.  After about 300 miles of travel we stopped for gas in the middle of nowhere.  We opened the car trunk and there was someone's cat in there.  So it seems the car trunk was left open all night, and right as we were leaving someone just slammed it shut, trapping the cat, who was sleeping amongst our sleeping bags and other gear.  We could not drive all the way back home.  The cat had a collar on it, so we knew it wasn't a stray.  It was probably a neighbors cat.  We were students and didn't really know our neighbors.  Our garage had a grilled side gate where raccoons and cats could get in.  Probably really dumb that we left the trunk open.  It could have been a raccoon in there.  Anyway, the cat was totally chill. We put a makeshift rope leash on him, because we were afraid we would lose him if he ran off in the woods at a stop.  He ate the same stuff we ate.  Tuna fish mostly, but sometimes pieces of Big Macs and hotdogs.  He hiked with us, riding on top of my friend's backpack, tied to it with the rope leash.  We brought him back two weeks later and let him go inside the garage.  We saw cat missing posters for him in the neighborhood with a number.  We could have called the number but decided not to.  We figured he knew how to get home on his own, and we didn't really have a good explanation for why we kidnapped someone's cat for two weeks.  I still don't know who the owners are.  I feel bad if they thought he was dead.  The little motherfucker had the same calm mood for his entire journey.  He never came back to the garage again, but I saw him chilling inside a gate a few times at another house.  I don't even know if that was his house.  Someone had changed his collar though, so I know he had been back home.  We never named him.  We just called him The Cat, the entire trip."

Imagine yourself how it'd feel if you were sitting resonably secure in a tree, then someone tried to lift you up. It'd be VERY scary. In fact, if it wasn't something you were okay with, you'd likely panic.  Have you ever tried to hold onto a panicking cat?

nonononoyes,3am3se,Tukajo,11,Sun Jun 21 21:59:28 2015 UTC,"If you watch the turns, you can see that the outside tires heat up more (stronger colour change) than the inside tires. I assume that the track is a closed loop and they are going clockwise (I haven't watched the entire video/a whole lap). As a result the left tires will heat up more throughout the race.  I guess that the car is a rear-wheel-drive so the rear tires heat up more than the ones at the front.  As a result the back left tire is the hottest."
nonononoyes,3am3se,dYYYb,3,Sun Jun 21 22:48:40 2015 UTC,Nailed it. The track is VIR (Virginia International Raceway) and it's a clockwise circuit.

nonononoyes,3am3se,autowikibot,5,Sun Jun 21 23:34:59 2015 UTC,Not sure if a dumb question. Do you think the fact the driver is on the left with a seating position that would put most body weight pretty close to the back wheel may have some part to play in that too?
nonononoyes,3am3se,Lextube,2,Mon Jun 22 00:27:41 2015 UTC,It would be hard to discount driver weight since it is a relatively significant portion of overall vehicle weight. Not sure how L/R balanced a car is without the driver but I am pretty sure it is balanced enough that driver weight would offset it.
nonononoyes,3am3se,249ba36000029bbe9749,2,Mon Jun 22 05:28:27 2015 UTC,"On top of what /u/249ba36000029bbe9749 said, the hight of the driver and the resulting change in the position of the centre of mass also plays a role. If the driver is taller or has his seat adjusted to a higher level, the vertical force on the outside tire will increase as well.   Assuming no skidding, symmetry, a mass of 1,500kg, a speed of 100km/h, going around a right turn with a radius of 100m, a centre of mass at the hight of 0.50m and distance between the left and right wheel of 1.8m:  The vertical force on the left wheels would be 10.72kN compared to 4.28kN on the right. The vertical force on the left increases as the hight of the centre of mass increases. e.g. if the centre of mass is lifted to a hight of 0.55m then the vertical force on the left wheels would equal 11.04kN and on the right it would equal 3.96kN."
nonononoyes,3am3se,dYYYb,0,Mon Jun 22 16:20:20 2015 UTC,the left back tire is hotter even on the larger left hand turns though
nonononoyes,3am3se,Tony_AbbottPBUH,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:14:23 2015 UTC,I think it also has something to do with the power distribution by the rear differential. Assuming it is a RWD car.

nonononoyes,3am3se,Yardsale420,12,Sun Jun 21 21:06:05 2015 UTC,They have roll hoops behind the drivers head (integrated into the bodywork). An actual cage around the driver would likely make it difficult to get the driver out in the case of an accident/fire/etc.
nonononoyes,3am3se,dirty_hooker,19,Sun Jun 21 17:41:15 2015 UTC,"There are roll hoops, so if the car turns over they'll be fine.  But for things like this, the sides of the cockpit, just by the helmet are quite tall. Changes were brought in a couple of years ago after this accident right at the start of the 2012 Belgian GP."

nonononoyes,3ag8l4,leica_boss,23,Sat Jun 20 14:16:38 2015 UTC,"I've said this before and I'll say it again. Why can't everyone practice, and take driving this seriously? Why can't we have drivers who have this kind of instinct and feel of the car/road? I know some people take it this seriously, but too many people see driving as a chore, and that's why we have accidents. We need more people who see driving as a passion, or at the very least, a necessary physical skill to master."
nonononoyes,3ag8l4,dotMJEG,32,Sat Jun 20 15:27:28 2015 UTC,"Because driving isn't just a hobby or sport, it's a gateway to freedom, in most of the world not being able to drive is a serious problem- can't get to work, can't buy food...  I agree, I think there need to be stricter and longer driver's ed courses and mandatory road time, it just isn't always feasible."
nonononoyes,3ag8l4,leica_boss,11,Sat Jun 20 15:55:41 2015 UTC,"As far as driver's ed courses, I think they need to be more technical, and more driving skill based, such as a course you get from a local racing club, or performance driving school. People need to practice loosing and recovering control of their car, feeling the road though the suspension, steering, and seat, and also finding out what they can and can't do in various road and weather conditions.  The driver's ed courses I've commonly seen and heard about are only rules of the road, with some practice in gentle traffic. They never actually teach you how to drive or control a car.  Once a little snow or rain hits, the problems happen. Even on a dry road, I think people in general need to be more in tune with their cars."
nonononoyes,3ag8l4,orangejulius,16,Sat Jun 20 16:03:20 2015 UTC,"When I was in high school I used to take the family car out in the rain in a big empty parking lot and power slide around, do donuts, spin the tires like crazy, etc. I thought I was just being a juvenile delinquent but it was actually a pretty invaluable lesson about driving the car in crap conditions.   I don't panic when the car hydroplanes or loses traction. I instinctively know how to recover it.  The reason I'm better off is because I really put the family car through the ringer.    I completely agree with you. I wish they would put high school kids on a closed course and have them practice losing traction and regaining control. It would probably save a lot of lives."

nonononoyes,3ag8l4,Dent18,2,Sat Jun 20 18:37:17 2015 UTC,Driver's ed is kinda bullshit. I know more about controlling a vehicle from watching tons of monster truck shows as a kid versus anything I learned from the state.

The reason why the driver hit his turn signal is because it's habit for him. When you see a car flying at you, your body obviously gives you a huge adrenaline rush, and if you don't panic, you will begin evasive maneuvers. Once you're doing something like that, your brain shuts down everything it doesn't need so that it can calculate trajectories (humans aren't that great at math so it's difficult) habits like turn signals, shouting curses, and shitting yourself happen on autopilot because your brain doesn't care about that stuff, it just says ""hand, do what you would normally do and go the fuck that way!"""

I figure probably 99% of drivers--myself included, luckily--have simply never been in a situation where they have to drive like that. Steering in an emergency situation is a skill that requires practice, and we are probably seeing the first time these drivers have ever had to do it. I don't think anyone should expect them to perform perfectly when they've never had to do it before."

It wasn't the wet road that got this driver into trouble."
nonononoyes,3ag8l4,CaCoD,2,Sat Jun 20 19:49:42 2015 UTC,"Well, it teaches you the correct reaction and muscle memory to learn how not to overcorrect when doing avoidance.

You basically never get to practice it, and when have to do it for real, it better be all in muscle memory because your lizard brain is the one that is driving during a crash.  In a crash your higher functions are basically off and you are doing whatever the hell it is unconscious wants to do.  You might make up a cute narrative after the fact about how you carefully thought out each action, but it is pretty much a lie.  The only way to really learn to not over correct like that is to practice in a course, over, and over, and over."

nonononoyes,3ahmqh,dotMJEG,3,Sat Jun 20 16:51:47 2015 UTC,Most likely because of it's bad diet and lack of excessive.
nonononoyes,3ahmqh,TeCuervo,2,Sun Jun 21 01:01:26 2015 UTC,"Abs might help, but what they really needed was traction control. Too much loading on one side caused uneven forces on the car, thus spinout. Traction control will pay attention to rotation etc and will apply braking force to each tire independently, essentially driving the car like a tank. Good traction controls can let you stop 60 to zero with half of the wheels on dirt while keeping it he car pointed roughly straight."

And a Kevlar shirt/jacket would further prevent road rash while maintaining the maneuverability and flexibility he needs to remain in control.

nonononoyes,3abarr,Armonster20,4,Fri Jun 19 02:16:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess it really depends on how you land and what you do after landing.

nonononoyes,3abarr,Armonster20,20,Fri Jun 19 04:27:26 2015 UTC,"I agree, but as a downhill longboarder, I understand why he might be doing it... It's not just longboarding, but a lot of extreme sports or hobbies in general. You get good and comfortable enough to a point where you think, ""I bet I could do that naked.""   Im obviously being a little extreme, but you get the point. You get so good at what you do, you decide to eliminate your protective gear because you think you're good enough to not need it.   It adds to the thrill of it, knowing you're a t-shirt away from being one big grease spot on the road. Honestly, it turns into a dick measuring contest with yourself, trying to one-up the last stupid thing you did for adrenaline or fun.   I know it's a stupid decision and I've done it myself... But to certain people, that phase 10 butthole pucker moment doing what you love ends up being a little more important than your own life 5 minutes from now.  It's similar to what goes through your head when you're addicted to drugs or alcohol.. ""I know I shouldn't do it, but what could go wrong this time? I've made it this far.""

Ended up skiing in snow pants and a tank top.  About an hour in to this idiocy, I fell for the first time in a long while. The snow, which looked soft as a pillow, felt like shards of glass as I slid down the hill. I slowly skied the rest of the way down, and spent the rest of the day in the lodge nursing scrapes on my hands and the left half of my body. My legs were spared only because of the snow pants."

nonononoyes,3abarr,Heroicis,3,Fri Jun 19 05:23:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, generally, going with traffic is safer. It's normally better to run into the back of a car going the same direction than it is to run head on into a car going the opposite.  If you're going downhill on a board or bike, you stay to the right, just like a car normally would and you obey the rules of the road. It's safer for everyone... But in this video, it seems like he's going down a one lane road in the wrong direction, which is never recommended.

You don't get to flagrantly break the law just because you took some precautions doing it. Going that fast on a board down an open road is the definition of fucknut behavior. Get a fucking clue, kid. If you and the other idiots want to fly down hills, buy your own piece of hilly land and pave a road down it, then ride to your heart's content. I wouldn't call that fucknut behavior. Doing it on a public road is. ""But DURRR WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT DURRR"". Yeah, no shit, just like I can't afford my own private race track. That doesn't mean I go out pretending to be Ken Block on weekends on public roads, putting my own fun before the safety of others. If the system you believe is making everything totally safe can fail, then you shouldn't be doing it at all. It's not like a skydive where the only person at risk is yourself.

nonononoyes,3abarr,wolfmanpraxis,2,Thu Jun 18 23:47:12 2015 UTC,Then honestly I don't put much blame on the rider. Seems like he thought it all out and the equipment is what put him in danger
nonononoyes,3abarr,aFuzzySponge,3,Fri Jun 19 00:50:29 2015 UTC,"I mean, going as fast as he is, he is very obviously an experienced rider, he knows whats up, but nobody would be able to work past all that bus.

The 192.5-meter-long Hansa Constitution was travelling along the busy East Lamma shipping channel when it suddenly veered off course. The Hong Kong Marine Department said the ship's main engine broke down. People familiar with the shipping industry say the captain and Hong Kong maritime authorities decided to the best course of action was to beach the vessel to prevent it from colliding with other ships on the busy shipping channel. The crew dropped anchor at the last minute, making loud screeching noises, to slow Hansa Constitution as it headed straight towards the sea wall outside the University of Hong Kong sports grounds in Pok Fu Lam. The ship ground to a halt at around 15.22 local. It then slowly reversed, as Marine, police and fire services rushed to the site. It was eventually towed free. No one was injured."

Or counter steer? Either way I can see that continuing to steer into the turn isn't going to be good."
nonononoyes,3a1e7j,xconde,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:07:45 2015 UTC,"I understand the not steering into the turn part.  It's an instant flip I guess.  In addition to letting off the throttle, would lightly braking help too?  I'd imagine that slamming on the brakes would be bad too."
nonononoyes,3a1e7j,Chemical_Castration,3,Wed Jun 17 11:18:47 2015 UTC,Seems to me braking could be bad. It depends on how sharp of a turn you have to maintain to keep from hitting the wall. If that amount puts your momentum vector outside the front wheel then braking would increase the roll.
nonononoyes,3a1e7j,cyniclawl,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:01:53 2015 UTC,"With that wall there all you can do is keep the car straight and hope the angular momentum of the roll slows down to the point where the car will naturally fall back down onto four wheels, before you run out of road on the right side.  If that wall wasn't there he'd just have steered right to throw the weight over to the ""airborne side"" of the car to bring it down."

If you look at the list of deaths in the World Rally Championship you'll see that the years soon after its ban (1987-1990) were worse for driver deaths. Looking at clips from that era too, you'll see that the spectators were still crazy and the safety features were still minimal. It's surprising that they didn't see another spectator death until 1995. If you ask me, they made the wrong choice in outright banning the cars instead of actually taking proper steps towards making the sport safer."

Turns out some sociopath had put a cinder block in the plastic bag and then left it in the middle of the street. That friend isn't alive anymore.

If something goes wrong, I fear, they lack the skills to avoid collisions. And some of those vehicles are BIG in the US carrying a lot of momentum/energy.

It feels like an arms race. If everyone around you is driving huge cars/trucks/suvs, you feel you have to drive one also( Studies show, you are much likely to survive a collision between two small cars vs two big cars) or it would be unsafe for you(I drive a compact/C-segment?).

nonononoyes,39u120,David-Puddy,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:42:02 2015 UTC,"The people probably stood in the opposite lane and then decided to cross in front of the first car that swerved. They backed up, saw the next car, and went for it."

nonononoyes,39u120,Changsta,48,Mon Jun 15 04:23:01 2015 UTC,Three AWESOME drivers at work there. Those reactiontimes are insane.
nonononoyes,39u120,Sylvester_Scott,47,Mon Jun 15 11:49:06 2015 UTC,4 drivers. If you look at the begining of the clip you see a gold van pull out to the dirt on the right.
nonononoyes,39u120,TUNGL,20,Mon Jun 15 19:12:17 2015 UTC,Probably even 5. You can see a silver car tail spinning to the right early in the video.

nonononoyes,39u120,irritatedcitydweller,13,Sun Jun 14 20:59:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's more like 2 awesome reaction times from drivers with a blocked line of sight and one guy who seriously wasn't paying attention and reacted way too late."
nonononoyes,39u120,TUNGL,8,Sun Jun 14 21:10:03 2015 UTC,more like awesome reactions from drivers driving WAY TOO CLOSE to the car in front.
nonononoyes,39u120,leica_boss,8,Sun Jun 14 21:36:51 2015 UTC,"True, but they wouldn't have had to react so quickly if they had been a little further from the cars ahead of them."
nonononoyes,39u120,leica_boss,0,Sun Jun 14 22:07:49 2015 UTC,That is true.
nonononoyes,39u120,veriix,-3,Mon Jun 15 03:32:56 2015 UTC,"While awesome, this should be the reaction time of every driver. Practice, practice, practice car control people. Everyone should be practicing car agility and know their car's handling like an extension of their own limbs.  Track days, autocross, rally, empty private lots, whatever you can arrange.   Practice in dry, rain, and snow.  Know your stopping distance, turning radius, and response of acceleration.  Get muscle memory feel for when your car is losing grip, re-gaining grip. Know what it takes to make your car spin, and to recover from it."
nonononoyes,39u120,smeezy,-4,Sun Jun 14 23:31:04 2015 UTC,Downvotes? Why shouldn't people be skilled drivers? You want unskilled drivers?
nonononoyes,39u120,leica_boss,6,Mon Jun 15 07:51:09 2015 UTC,"Probably because defensive, safe driving is more important than knowing the limits of your car."
nonononoyes,39u120,aallzz,3,Sun Jun 14 23:49:32 2015 UTC,Not mutually exclusive. Defensive driving and car control at the extremes are both valuable in saving lives.
nonononoyes,39u120,pedunt,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:34:44 2015 UTC,"You need to be familiar with your car's handling in order to drive defensively.  Also, when I referred to limits, I do not mean that in the sense of pushing limits. But knowing them from safe practice. There's times when the ""safe limit"" is half the legal speed limit, due to conditions.  It's about practicing and knowing road, weather, and mechanical conditions, and how your car responds do them.   You need to know your braking distance. If an obstruction comes up in the road, you need to know whether you can stop in time, or whether you should dodge to the side. Vehicle capabilities, and road/whether conditions determine the answer for the situation.  You don't have time to think. It needs to be instinctive.  Instinct is tuned from practice."
nonononoyes,39u120,aallzz,14,Mon Jun 15 02:32:44 2015 UTC,"Christ my instinct would've been to swerve left like the first car did, since the car immediately in front swerved right.  Woulda killed those folks, and even if I'm a sociopath it'll ruin my day cause they woulda fucked up my hood."
nonononoyes,39u120,pedunt,4,Mon Jun 15 00:57:21 2015 UTC,How does this make sense? Why would you swerve left because the car in front swerved right?
nonononoyes,39u120,chosenone1242,3,Mon Jun 15 07:48:47 2015 UTC,"Thinking that they may swerve right and brake hard, which'd just send me swerving even harder right and more likely to lose control of the car."
nonononoyes,39u120,dog_in_the_vent,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:22:42 2015 UTC,But they will have swerved to avoid an obstacle. Your logic just doesn't make sense to me.

nonononoyes,39u120,Bologna9000,2,Mon Jun 15 13:39:22 2015 UTC,"You have to weigh the risks and benefits of both options.  The two options here are to quickly change direction to avoid hitting these people, or run through them.  --- Changing direction:  Benefits:  Potentially avoid killing people, save car from damage from people  Risk: Steer into oncoming traffic OR ram car in right lane and potentially cause a larger accident and cause injury to self, as well as car. (Your not going to have time to check your side mirrors in a case like this.)  Potentially lose control of car, veer off road and hit large immobile object and seriously injure self.  ( Have you ever had to regain control of a fast moving vehicle?  If you never have its not as easy as you might think -- I can imagine a lot of people rolling cars trying to do so)  --- Steer the course:  Benefits: Much lower risk of veering off road and hitting other cars, potentially injuring people who have done nothing wrong.  Risk: Likely seriously injure or kill the dumbasses. damage car, potentially injure self.  Frankly I wouldn't wrong someone for plowing through these two dumbfucks.  I'd probably make a small change in direction, but if they get hit they get hit at that point.    If you don't want to pay the game, don't roll the dice.  In this case the game being Chicken with highway speed vehicles, and rolling the dice being stepping foot onto that road."
