opera,3e50l9,espositojoe,3,Wed Jul 22 00:27:51 2015 UTC,"The Met production of The Merry Widow is very good. I saw it live, and loved it. Act I drags a fair bit, but that's about all the complaining I can do. Renee Fleming and Nathan Gunn are about as good as you'd expect. Kelli O'Hara is fantastic, and Thomas Allen is, of course, a legend. The production itself is rather traditional. Regular costumes, regular sets. The main ""Broadway"" element, if you can call it that, is the big interlude between Acts II and III, where the set goes through a huge change right in front of the audience. You see stuff like that on Broadway stages all the time, but I'd never seen it at the opera before. It's really great.  Also, I take a certain amount of offense to you implying that ""Broadway"" and opera mixing is a bad thing. I am a huge fan of both opera and musical theater, and a huge proponent of mixing the two. They're really the same art form, just different spots along the spectrum. After all, Sweeney Todd has more singing than The Magic Flute. The music in Passion is more ""classical"" than Porgy And Bess. The lines blur an awful lot, and I am a major proponent of doing everything to bring fans of musicals more into opera and vice versa. Kelli O'Hara, Kristin Chenoweth, and George Hearn, among many others, are classically trained singers who might've gone into opera, but ended up huge names on Broadway instead. And Kelli O'Hara has a fantastic voice, and she really shines as Valencienne."

opera,3dzgzy,smnytx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:33:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was her technique at all; I believe in the theory that she was really a mezzo, and all the sfogato roles took a toll on a hefty voice. If you look on Spotify, there are some recordings of her singing Mozart, whose music she mostly avoided, saying it wasn't right for her voice. She's entirely right, the tessitura exposes her voice in a most unpleasant way. I think that for some reason that music really exposed the true nature of her voice; the rest of the time she was one of those true assoluta voices. Mozart didn't accommodate for this voice type much."

opera,3dy7v8,Krisington22,2,Mon Jul 20 14:40:01 2015 UTC,"A few minor nitpicks with the list of deaths:  Aida and Gilda could both be considered suicide. Especially Aida, since no one knew she was going to be sneaking into the tomb with Radames.  Antonia could easily be said to have been murdered by Dr. Miracle with magic.  I'll grant you Dido's death being ambiguous in the opera. In the Aeneid, she stabs herself. I just sort of always carried that over to nonspecific suicide in the opera.  Scarpia and Tosca are both counted, as murder and suicide respectively. Mario and Angelotti are skipped over. Also murder and suicide respectively. I'm wondering if executions might be better considered their own category.  And so many characters from the Ring Cycle... Siegfried was the only one counted, but Fasolt, Fafner, Mime, Gunther, Siegmund, Hunding, and maybe Hagen would up the murder count. Brunnhilde adds one for suicide, and Sieglinde one more for childbirth.  Similarly, Lulu is the only character counted from Lulu. All the rest of the deaths in that opera would seriously up the murder count. Plus one for heart attack.  I would be curious to see this done more thoroughly with, say, the top 100 most performed operas, and also see it adjusted for popularity, so one-hundred performances of La Traviata count for more deaths of TB than one performance of Wozzeck counts for deaths of stabbing. See what the breakdown is of deaths the audience is paying to see.  EDIT: Also, I'm wondering about the voice type breakup. Which voice type has the highest mortality rate? I mean, it's probably soprano, but you never know."

Sadly, the scope of his work demands a lot of preparation to really ""get"", sort of like reading Ulysses. I recommend you read up on his work first. Read at least the first chapter of the Tristan Chord, a great book about why he's so great. Then I recommend starting with earlier (shorter) Wagner like Tannhauser. Tristan, Parsifal and the Ring Cycle you will probably adore, if you build up some appreciation first before you get to them.  Believe me, the end result is so worth the challenge. Nothing like it in the world.  My fave DVDs:  Parsifal from the Met (with Kaufmann, Pape) The Chereau/Boulez Ring Cycle from Bayreuth (the best bar none)  Have fun!"

You need to be able to read music and have some theory background to get/absorb some it.  Telling someone they need to jump with Cooke's I Saw The World End (by far the best book on Wagner) may scare them off.  If I were you OP I would start with the ""bleeding chunks.""  Those would be the highlights of his best/well known operas.  If you like what you hear of say the prelude to the 3rd act of Meistersinger explore that more and listen to a highlights of Meistersinger and then jump into a full version (either audio/video).  Then again ignore all of us and just listen and explore.  There is no one way/best way to listen to music.  Just listen."

They were the organization that hired the performers and organized the recording (presumably). The conductor was Karl Böhm. It was composed by W. A. Mozart.   I would also add that it wasn't popularized by ""The Shawshank Redemption"". Le nozze di Figaro/The Marriage of Figaro is perfectly established within world culture, and although tSR might have introduced it to a new audience, I guarantee that many people knew of its existence already and were beyond intimately acquainted with it - which is probably why they used it in the film. Figaro has been a standard in the operatic repertoire since its introduction 230 years ago or so. It is one of the most performed operas in the world.  ""Sull'aria"" is lovely, but it's not meant to be heart-wrenching. It's something of a defiant joke actually in the context of the opera, context which I think would be important to a playwright. If you used ""Sull'aria"" in a sad moment, then everyone who's familiar with it with have some cognitive dissonance. It is actually used ironically in tSR.   Forgive me if I sound snobbish, but this is basic knowledge within the operatic world. I genuinely do not wish to insult you, but rather encourage you to take the harder road that lets you make a decision from a position of education and understanding.   If you want to introduce something new to your non-operatic theatrical audience, then you should acquaint yourself with standard operatic repertoire since you probably won't already know what is known and what isn't known (judging by your comments re: ""Sull'aria"" here). From there you can make a more educated decision that's appropriate for what you're doing that integrates the dramatic context of the piece alongside the music. In fact, using something that is well-known can be effective (see the use of ""Nessun dorma"" in the final episode of Daredevil season 1 for a good example that worked on several levels).   If you do follow one of the suggestions that someone has provided in this thread, then please take the time to find out how that piece of music works dramatically in the context of the full opera before sticking it into your play. The piece might sound pretty, but it might undermine what you're trying to achieve in that moment if you're not careful."

Here's Battistini's recording of ""Il mio Lionel"". And here's Ruffo singing ""Chi mi dirà"".  For a slightly different style—will trills and all—here's French bass Pol Plançon. It's transposed a step down."
opera,3d6kys,TotoCotogni,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:00:12 2015 UTC,Cool! Thank you! I adore Ruffo. So you don't think I'd be criticized for singing the French version that goes to the low F?
opera,3d6kys,TotoCotogni,4,Tue Jul 14 00:31:05 2015 UTC,"First it should definitely be sung in the original key of F major, which means the lowest note is G.  Second, if you're thinking of doing this for auditions, I'd have to recommend against it. Almost no one has even heard of this aria, and certainly even fewer know of the baritone part of the tradition, so for the average juror or whatever, all they know is ""low voice role in Martha = bass"", so they're going be confused and start running you through the ringer: ""Why are you singing a bass piece?"" ""Do you really think you'd realistically get hired for this role?""  And of course because the rules of competitions and auditions are so arbitrarily stringent when it comes to language, it would have to be done in German (where the baritone tradition does not really exist).  But if you're learning it for your own pleasure or for a recital, then I think you should feel free to do whatever's the best fit and feeling for you, whatever makes the best effect. If I, personally, sang this aria in recital, I would do it in Italian."

I don't sing much repertoire that requires a lot of staccato singing, but the advice I'd give you is to be sure to support both from your diaphragm (I think that's what you mean) and from your lower back. It helps every pitch vibrate, as nothing is muscled or forced, but supported properly.  I like to think of every time you take a breath, you're filling a barrel. Throughout the phrase, keep trying to expand the barrel while you're singing. It seems counterintuitive when I'm typing this out, but that image has really helped me. It engages your core and your back, which was a very different sensation for me compared to what I used to consider proper support."

Just point your browser to ""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/[insert word here]"", find Italian and most of the time it will know the pronunciation.  If the IPA characters are unfamiliar to you, and the messy IPA table looks intimidating, here a few easy videos to help you understand the idea behind the whole thing: Place of articulation, Manner of articulation, Voicing, Vowels.  The relationship between Italian spelling and pronunciation is much more sensible than that in English. I'd say learning just one or two dozen words will already give you a fairly good idea on how to deduce the pronunciation from the written word.

Such approaches allow plenty of room for creativity without being too  distracting. Having literal productions in literal settings really isn't really creative at all- it's actually quite the opposite. It just is just as uncreative as an accurate production, but falsely gives the satisfaction of originality just by changing a few costumes.   And the times that productions actually try to be creative with their staging on top of the costumes, it is usually garish, distracting, and distasteful, as this article exemplifies."

It did absolutely nothing to the opera, though. It's just Cherubino has a more modern uniform and that's about it. And that's the case with most transplanted productions. At best, the story is such that it really changes nothing, at worst, it sticks out as horribly wrong. I don't know that I've ever seen a transplanted production that actually put something extra into the opera for me that couldn't have been in a traditional staging (as opposed to an abstract production like the Decker Traviata, which did have something new that I liked). At best, for a popular opera like Le Nozze Di Figaro, it's a nice break from the usual powdered wigs. Which isn't bad, it's just not very remarkable is all.  I do think the upcoming Manon Lescaut at the Met looks promising, though. That's one I could conceivably see bringing something new into the new setting."

Wondering how it will be..  I'm spoiled at the Stockholm Opera House because if you're under 26 you can buy any ticket at half price, so I usually book one of the open boxes."

opera,3bqpgg,faklsnfk,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:13:19 2015 UTC,Really?!  Can I ask why?
opera,3bqpgg,DrMephistopheles,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:26:46 2015 UTC,I agree that it was a fantastic and effective production! But I feel that such productions are few and far between...
opera,3bqpgg,NerdusMaximus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:58:50 2015 UTC,"As a follow-up, I just saw the live broadcast of the opera and it appears that they've toned down the nudity in the offending scene. Honestly, without knowing that this controversy had occured I'd have rated the scene highly - the juxtaposition of trivial military music with the uncomfortable sexual reality of war was rather effective."
opera,3brgh3,Ragtime-roast-beefy,2,Wed Jul 1 15:35:28 2015 UTC,"I first heard this song on GTA 2 (I think? It was the only one that had a classical music station on the radio) and fell in love with it, so I looked it up and bought the CD. It is also one of my favorites. Thank you!"
opera,3brgh3,WriterUnknown,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:12:57 2015 UTC,"This is one of my favorites. The YouTube description says 1991, which is certainly corroborated by Renee's fashion and hair style choices..."
opera,3brgh3,chezlillaspastia,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:37:15 2015 UTC,"You should check out the Act 1 finale of Lucrezia Borgia for another beautiful and similar ensemble. I think it starts with ""Maffio Orsini, signore, son io"""
opera,3braj7,Jack_Ketch,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:50:26 2015 UTC,It will be really interesting to see how this works out.  I was really hoping that he would get Berlin but I am quite excited to see/hear the results of this.  I am a huge HUGE fan of his mid 2000's Parsifal.  It immediately became my preferred version and probably my favorite Wagner recording.
opera,3bq6bb,hereforthebenzene,2,Wed Jul 1 06:47:02 2015 UTC,"Not to take away from everything that is gorgeous about her and her voice, but why is she wearing what looks like a letterman's jacket over a ballgown?"
opera,3bq6bb,elerico,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:34:09 2015 UTC,"It looks like a costumey jacket with the sequins and the straps, like she threw it on for this aria. I can't connect it to the piece myself, maybe Aida is supposed to have borrowed Radames jacket or something?"
opera,3bmoaw,dem-deutschen-wolke,8,Tue Jun 30 13:31:22 2015 UTC,That sounds like the Act 1 finale of Rossini's L'italiana in Algeri.
opera,3bmoaw,drgeoduck,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:53:36 2015 UTC,Oh my gosh! Yes! That's it! Thank you so much!
opera,3bmoaw,Yoyti,2,Tue Jun 30 19:01:32 2015 UTC,"This is a standard in Bel Canto comedy. A lot of Rossini's operas have these sorts of scenes. My favorite is O Ciel from Le Comte Ory, just because the reveal of Ory's identity is hilarious.  But if you're pretty sure it's from G&S, maybe Here's A How-De-Do from The Mikado? Or perhaps Here Is A Case Unprecedented from The Gondoliers or How Say You Maiden from The Yeomen Of The Guard."
opera,3bh329,ChrisStockslager,5,Mon Jun 29 04:07:20 2015 UTC,Ravel wrote the Cinq mélodies populaires grecques which you can sing in either French of Greek if you so choose and can find the Greek text somewhere. It's not that uncommon for people to sing it in Greek.  There's a contemporary Greek composer named Christos Hatzis who has written some art song in Greek.
opera,3bh329,stravadarius,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:33:23 2015 UTC,Came here to say this! It's a great set and very fun to perform.
opera,3bh329,RyanK663,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:04:32 2015 UTC,"Of course there are!  There are some modern operas (in Greek) and operettas that are very popular written in the classical style.  Even greek art songs, there are tons (written in the 30's - 60's).  When I get back home I'll get you some names"
opera,3bh329,kungura,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:01:11 2015 UTC,"Fabulous; thank you! Is most of it tonal / traditional / romantic, or being newer, more on the dissonant side?"
opera,3bh329,kungura,2,Mon Jun 29 08:49:36 2015 UTC,"No no, it's almost all classical, tonal and very sweet music with great lyrics"
opera,3bh329,ibellifinzi,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:52:11 2015 UTC,"Yay! Do you know of any outstanding examples? I'm looking at the Ravel right now, and A. I like it (very dreamy!), but don't love it, and B. It seems only available in sheet music with the French lyrics. :/"
opera,3bh329,ibellifinzi,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:55:58 2015 UTC,"Xenakis wrote a couple of pieces for baritone. Challenging stuff, but might be worth a shot."
opera,3bg5x6,suvdonkey,2,Sun Jun 28 22:55:55 2015 UTC,"It's Nino Rossano from an album called ""Italiano Opera"" that features him singing a bunch of Italian arias. I found it on Xbox Music. It's a perfect match."
opera,3bg5x6,teni3e,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:43:03 2015 UTC,"I was watching it on Youtube and I don't know if it is or not. Is this the right one, because playing them side by side doesn't sound right.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZZWzQqZXUc"
opera,3bg5x6,ttchoubs,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:48:15 2015 UTC,My guess is Florindo Andreolli
opera,3bg5x6,ttchoubs,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:40:59 2015 UTC,Could you maybe send me a link of him singing it please?  The only other person I can think of is Plácido Domingo.
opera,3bg5x6,ttchoubs,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:30:08 2015 UTC,The only link I know of is a torrent but I downloaded it a while ago let me find it and upload a clip
opera,3bg5x6,stravadarius,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:57:54 2015 UTC,I torrent all the time. Could I please get the torrent link if you can't get the song by itself?  Oh and thank you very much BTW! I've been looking all day.

opera,3bf9ns,crazyvibes,2,Sun Jun 28 18:24:59 2015 UTC,It means that there are no 'bumps' in the coloratura passages - no notes stick out or are longer or louder than the others.

opera,3bf9ns,pls_learn_ur_role,2,Sun Jun 28 20:21:28 2015 UTC,"After returning as Almaviva in 1987, he took his first Mozart part at the Royal Opera House, the high-flying role of Belmonte, in Die Entführung aus dem Serail, striking every note with clarity and even runs."
