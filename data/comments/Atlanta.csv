Atlanta,3e2mm1,shzadh,30,Tue Jul 21 14:07:17 2015 UTC,"Go wine tasting at Sharp Mountain Vineyards Just 45 minutes away in the beautiful (and romantic) North Georgia mountains, Sharp Mountain Vineyards produces some of the region’s finest, most award-winning wines -- and it's the only Georgia winery to create three varieties! Five bucks a person gets you a generous choice of four wines, so pack some picnic-style eats, tour its gorgeous pavilion, and get a little soused in a decidedly sophisticated way. Taco Tuesdays at Mother There’s nothing better than tacos, right? WRONG. There are cheap tacos, specifically the ones at this Old Fourth Ward favorite, where tacos are $2 each on Tuesdays. Oh and it also has $2 tequila shots and $2 Tecate. That’s what’s up. Wander around Oakland Cemetery An enormous historical relic, Oakland Cemetery is the final resting place of some of Atlanta’s most famous figures. It’s also one of the city’s most valued green spaces, full of beautiful trees and foliage as well as stunning architecture. It regularly has a variety of cool tours and events, but simple admission is free! Pack a picnic and explore the grounds -- if you get hungry, you can also stop in at Six Feet Under across the street for some delicious, wallet-friendly fried seafood. Nerd out at Fernbank Science Center andPlanetarium On Thursday and Friday nights, Fernbank Science Center offers free admission for everyone wanting to geek out over its telescope. Pair this with the Planetarium, where the round, heavenly theater is truly beautiful. Admission tickets are just $7, which is a meager price to pay for reenacting your own version of Ross and Rachel’s infamous date. See a free movie in the park Throughout the summer, Atlanta has several movie in the park options and most of them are free. Our favorite? Atlantic Station’s Movies in Central Park, which gets major points for being romantic (and not showing crappy films, either). Better still, many of Atlantic Station’s restaurants offer special to-go movie prices (like Chick-a-Biddy’s mouth-watering chicken biscuit with any side for just $10). Go to Church Inside the walls of Church, you’ll find kitsch, kitsch, and more kitsch. Oh, and no cover charge. And 24oz PBR cans for $3, and top-shelf liquors for $6.  Depending on the day of week, you’ll also find Ping-Pong tournaments, tarot card readings, and church organ karaoke. If you sing, definitely don an authentic choir robe. Free pizza at Argosy For a late-night date any day of the week, head to Argosy in East Atlanta Village, where the purchase of two refreshingly cold draft beers gets you a free and delicious fresh, wood-fired pizza after 11pm. A brewery tour and tasting at Monday Night Brewing Every Monday, Thursday, and Saturday, you can tour Monday Night Brewing, where just $10 will get you a nifty souvenir pint glass and access to six 6oz beer samples. Oh, and if your tour happens to coincide within a day of your birthday, your $10 fee is waived! Broaden your horizons at the Castleberry Hill Art Stroll Atlanta is known for its killer art scene, and what makes it even better is that you can take it in for free. Case in point: the Castleberry Hill Art Stroll, which takes place the second Friday of every month and showcases cool, diverse art galleries in one of the city’s most up-and-coming neighborhoods. No wonder it’s been called the best art stroll in Atlanta. Catch a flick at the Starlight Drive-In Theatre Just $9 per adult gets you access to two movies on the same screen at what is arguably the city’s oldest, most beloved movie theater. Stretch out and relax in the privacy of your car underneath a blanket of stars. It has its own concession stand, but to keep costs down, go ahead and bring along your own food and drink. Hit the Grant Park Farmers Market Are you and your special friend morning people? Then head over to the Grant Park Farmers Market on Sunday morning for all sorts of delicious local treats, from Revolution Doughnuts to Doggy Dogg hot dogs. Pick up any number of tasty things and stroll the grounds of Atlanta’s oldest -- and some would say most beautiful -- park. Packing a blanket, lying down, and whispering sweet nothings isn’t a bad idea, either. Take the Atlanta Streetcar somewhere Atlanta’s new streetcar is not only impressively sleek and fun to ride, it’s free throughout 2015. Hop on it, knock your date a kiss, and take it any number of places, like historicCentennial Olympic Park or the diverse, delicious Sweet Auburn Curb Market, where you can get authentic, otherworldly arepas at Arepa Mia for under $10! Chow down on $2 burgers at Hand in Hand A British-style pub in the heart of Virginia Highlands, Hand in Hand is a good deal any day of the week, but Tuesday absolutely can’t be missed. That’s when it offers hearty, mega-meaty burgers for just $2. If the weather cooperates, definitely enjoy it on its spacious, beautiful patio. Grab a sandwich at Victory Sandwich Bar On its own, Victory Sandwich Bar’s industrial, yet warm environment and solid menu make it a great date spot. Even better, it has inventive sandwiches for just $4 and $5. After you eat, walk around the corner to Decatur Square, where you can spit game under the stars."

Atlanta,3e278x,youonlylive2wice,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:47:42 2015 UTC,Its designed different... Soccer turf is more expensive but it will be all that is used at the new one.  No reason to change it but if its just football there's no reason to use the soccer turf.

For one thing, drivers get a significant benefit from the way in which MARTA effectively removes thousands of cars from the road. Aside from the 1% sales tax, drivers don't really pay for that benefit.  I also think that the article underestimates the impact a fare increase would have on ridership. Just see what happened the last time fares went up. Those people didn't stop going to work, they just started driving instead and thus added to traffic."
Atlanta,3e30fe,thehambeast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:47:44 2015 UTC,"Unless MARTA expands the rail lines to Cobb I don't see how the system will ever be used more than it is right now.

Atlanta,3e30fe,falcon897,4,Tue Jul 21 18:18:54 2015 UTC,"Unless MARTA expands the rail lines to Cobb I don't see how the system will ever be used more than it is right now.    There are current plans to expand rail service to North Fulton (up GA 400), Stonecrest (out I-20), the CDC/Emory area (Clifton Corridor LRT), etc. That doesn't also include the recent start of service in Clayton nor the possibility of Gwinnett approving MARTA in the next 1-2 years, with would allow an extension of the Gold Line past Doraville.   I find it funny that they would even compare our meager system to New York's labyrinth.   A better comparison would be to WMATA and BART, which were built a few years before MARTA."

When I signed up for Uverse FOUR YEARS AGO they were promising upgraded gateways (modem and router combined into one craptastic unit) were just about to come out. When I canceled my service a month ago, I was still using the same crappy 2WIRE Wireless G Gateway, despite numerous calls in the interim to upgrade (no upgrade was available). Yes, you can put your own router behind their gateway if you prefer, but that created extra headaches and wasn't worth the trouble IMO. Also, Uverse's cable boxes were dated and had slow, laggy interfaces, even with the recent upgrades. Comcast may be the devil, but AT&T is not much better and the service they're selling is worse."

Going to be living in Atlanta for the next 5 or so years pursuing my PhD at GT, so I'm interested in knowing how diverse the food is in Atlanta? I did my undergrad in Boston and also have close ties to San Francisco and Philly, so I've been spoiled by the diversity and authenticity of cuisines. I've heard Buford highway is where I should check out; how authentic is the food there, especially for Chinese and Japanese food? On a side note, any comments on the Asian population and culture in Atlanta? I'm an international student from Taiwan so I've got strong ties to Asian culture.  Also, how's the nerd/geek scene? I know that Atlanta has like 3 major conventions so obviously people are into games, anime, etc., but how prevalent is it and where do I go meet people?  Very excited to be moving into Atlanta! I'm looking forward to the car, gun, and beer scenes, as well as Southern food, but I'm also afraid I'll miss out on some of my other hobbies and favorite cuisines that were pretty big in Boston and SF."
Atlanta,3e2035,genghistran,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:06:45 2015 UTC,"Atlanta food is diverse. Good, ""authentic"" Asian food won't be in the city, so I hope you have a car or know someone who does. In the city, you'll find good Asian food with more of a fusion flair.   Japanese food is lacking in Atlanta. There are some good spots, notably Umaido and Shoya Izakaya, but if you are used to prime Japanese food, you'll probably be a bit disappointed. Ramen is making a rise here with some quality places, but it still isn't top notch. Japanese here seems to just slightly miss the mark.  Chinese food is good, pretty much anything down the Buford Hwy strip. Ming's BBQ is good for char-siu, etc, Gu's Dumplings in Krog Street offers some Szechuan fare (their location on Buford Hwy has closed), Harmony is a great vegetarian place, Chef Liu has a wide array of Chinese food styles (also has Taiwanese), but head into the Chinatown Mall Food Court for at least a somewhat feeling of authentic Chinese street food. If you are used to good dim sum in SF, you won't be happy with anything here. It's passable and a novelty at best, but nothing that really is better than the frozen stuff you can get at Asian groceries. People will say Canton House for dim sum, but eh, ain't for me. Go into the Hoa Binh grocery store to get some great siu-yuk, quail, roast duck, etc. My favorite place to go and get a couple pounds of meat to take home.  Vietnamese food is my jam, and the Vietnamese community is strong here. Pho Bac and Pho Dai Loi II are the two top joints in my opinion for noodles, rice dishes, street food. Nam Phuong for a more sit-down restaurant vibe, but not my favorite. Lee's Bakery is popular but ultimately mediocre, and for the best banh mi hit up Quoc Huong, complete with old Asian ladies yelling at you (cash only, closed Thursdays!!). There are a couple other spots, but I think you really only need to know the two pho places and Quoc Huong for banh mi.  For Korean, So Kong Dong for tofu soup. Cho Dang Tofu House for tofu soup as well with less people and a nice elderly couple serving you (I prefer Cho Dang, sister prefers So Kong Dong). Stone Bowl for straight-forward standard fare. Oh! My Samgyupsal and Iron Age for Korean BBQ. People will mention Honey Pig but I've never had great stuff there. I could go on and on about Korean barbecue but when it all boils down to it, none of them really stand out from the other. Find one where you enjoy the atmosphere and service. For instance, Iron Age is hip as fuck and blasts K-Pop on a giant screen with waxy-haired Asian sassy-dudes serving you, while some other places have older folks doing it. The meat is mostly pretty difficult to tell from each other.   Inside the city, Makan is OK but eh, lacks that je ne sais quoi (also in Decatur and not Atlanta proper but whatever). They locally source a lot of stuff if you're into that. We Suki Suki for Vietnamese, but none of it all too inspiring. Hsu's for more expensive Chinese, meh. Cherry Blossom for Korean fusion in Downtown. Gu's Dumplings in Krog Street Market, like I mentioned. Lucky Buddha on 10th if you find yourself shitfaced at 3AM, hah. Su's Chinese for probably the best damn General Tso's Chicken I've had in the city, if you're into that stuff.  Plenty more but I think I've spent enough time outing how much time I've eaten Asian food here."

If you're looking for non-American food then Buford Highway is where you want to go.  I don't have much experience with the Chinese and Japanese restaurants there, but the Mexican, Vietnamese, and Korean restaurants there are very authentic.  They mostly serve immigrants from their various countries so they have to be authentic.  There's a large, thriving Asian population in Atlanta.  Most PhD programs at GT are majority international students, with the majority of those being Asian.  You will have no trouble at all connecting with people from your country at school.

I have been room mom twice and have had to shell out money from my own pockets to cover children other than my own on certain things. And as a pre-k teacher, I spend a lot on my (classroom) kids throughout the year.. the budget in most schools doesn't stretch very far and I want to give my class the best education that I can."

Atlanta,3e0jxp,rocketpastsix,6,Tue Jul 21 12:47:42 2015 UTC,Check out donorschoose.org to see some of what teachers typically request.  It runs the gamut from simple things like pencils to books to tablets.  Depends on the grade and subject.  In low income districts it is truly depressing.

Atlanta,3e0jxp,phoenixgsu,4,Tue Jul 21 10:54:43 2015 UTC,"Kleenex, hand sanitizer, and bleach wipes are always a priority. Some parents donate extra in case other kids can't.   Even with all the donations I still end up spending over a $100 of my own money every year so my kiddos can have what they need."
Atlanta,3e0jxp,phoenixgsu,2,Tue Jul 21 05:30:55 2015 UTC,Parents of kids never actually bring all the stuff on the supply list. Teachers have to come up with what's missing. My wife spends hundreds of dollars each year on supplies the parents should have bought.  Not to mention all of the ink and paper I have to restock at home so she can print work sheets for her kids because the school system limits how much they can use.
Atlanta,3e0jxp,alien_abduction,0,Tue Jul 21 13:37:52 2015 UTC,"Is this why they request 6 boxes of the 24 pack pencils every year from every kid?  As a parent this shit drive me nuts.  No kid can use that many pencils in a year.  I almost punched a volunteer when I found out they toss them when the erasers were gone.  Moving from a district that was 80% free lunch and had to beg for books, this kind of waste is insane."
Atlanta,3e0jxp,count_schemula,2,Tue Jul 21 15:13:36 2015 UTC,Yea cause your kids break them or chew on them. My wife stopped buying pencils for kids because they waste them.
Atlanta,3e0jxp,CarbonFiberFootprint,-5,Tue Jul 21 18:17:47 2015 UTC,Glad we'll get to replenish all those scantron erasers we've been going through somehow...

Atlanta,3e0jxp,WaffleSandwhiches,-2,Tue Jul 21 03:58:01 2015 UTC,They should put it towards hiring more security at the Murder Kroger.
Atlanta,3e0jxp,KrogerPR,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:35:37 2015 UTC,"We can assure you that Beltline Kroger has hired more security. We are actively seeking out vehicles to boot, so that thieves may not steal cars from our parking lots.   Hope this helps."
Atlanta,3e2lny,BrandonD1234,2,Tue Jul 21 13:59:25 2015 UTC,"Seems like a good idea. How do they define ""metro area""?  Edit: I found the app on Google Play. I searched for ""Pronto App"" and it was the 18th result. I downloaded ti to see what their coverage area is and I can't check out the app at all without giving them my name, phone number, email address, and home address.  No thanks. Show me a good product and then I'll sign up. I don't hand you all my personal info out of the gate."
Atlanta,3e2lny,OccasionallyWright,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:06:15 2015 UTC,"Interesting but it seems like it would be a logistical nightmare. There are quite a few specialties within the ""handyman"" designation: e.g. plumber, electrician, carpenter. Also, I'd want some type of estimate before work began (e.g. will the job take 15 min or 3 hours?). And what if parts are needed? Do I pay for them at cost, is there a standard markup, and is the ""meter"" running while the handyman runs to HD to pick up whatever is needed?"
Atlanta,3e2lny,mb44,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:27:51 2015 UTC,I believe it's a flat rate of $86/ hour even if materials are required and they cover everything ITP.
