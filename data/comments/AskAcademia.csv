Do you know anyone at the company and/or know any academic staff that now people at the company ... this will give you a leg up on the other candidates?  As far as the letter goes, do it on university letterhead and make it look proper. I would also get one or two additional references letters from academic staff and include those even if they don't ask for them. It's kind of pushy (in Britain) but could help if the others don't do that.   I did this for a few students last year for an industry placement and the people called me to confirm that I wrote them. I try to make it as easy as possible for the panel/manager (my phone number and group URL - hyperlinked - is in the footer of the PDF, which lowers their activation energy to confirm that I exist and wrote the letter)."
AskAcademia,3e6h6r,acidfast_sieben,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:41:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know anyone at the company. Plus this is the first time the position is being offered to someone from my department, so the lecturers aren't familiar with the role either. The company specialises in weapons, military vehicles and defense, which is nothing to do with my degree, it just happens that they do have a small team of scientific advisors.   The covering letter is being sent as an email. Plus for coursework i know that we aren't allowed to use the university logo due to copyright of it, so the same would probably apply for this scenario.   No mention of references was made, so I have emailed the lecturer that told me about the placement asking how many and what kind of references to provide."

I would be shocked if you're an enrolled student and can't send something with the university logo on it ... just like a letterhead. However, the UK does amaze sometimes (been here less than two years).  Especially when dealing with those types of companies, it sounds good to be very professional (proper letterhead) and additional references. I would wager that it's also good to be moderately pushy such that you stand out from your peers.  In all, it sounds like an interesting proposition and I wish you luck.  edit: Just checked online and it seems that people are divided about whether to or not use the logo. I've moved up the academic ladder in the UK and when I applied for the newer post, I use the letterhead of the current position as I thought it would look impressive. Whether or not it helped or not, I can't say. But, I highly doubt that anyone would really care and if the university is somewhere good, or really known for what you're applying for, I would do it/risk it. In addition, I personally think it would look better, especially if the others don't do that. The tiny risk, IMHO, is totally outweighed by the benefits."

From the wording of the email from my lecturer it sounds as if the position has only been offered to students from two courses at my university. So they're only expecting letters from students from our university. It's a mid ranking uni but my kind of course is only taught at a handful of unis and the department here is better than average for the uni."

I review stuff all the time (papers, student apps, grants, etc...) that have cover letters. I just think when I scroll through a pile of stuff, it just looks much better and helps the documents stand out. However, maybe your uni makes a big deal about certain things, however, as a reviewer I wouldn't care at all about your uni's regulations and if other people did use the logo, I would be curious why others didn't. Even though I have formal training in avoiding unconscious bias, it would really stand out.  But, then again, I usually tend to be very pushy (German system still remains in me).  Good luck."

Go to libx.org and see if your school has a libx tool.  If they do, install it and it will let you route any link through your school's proxy.  If they don't, you'll have to manually prepend the proxy url in front of the article's url.  You can also ask your university librarians to set up a libx edition for your school.  Sadly, Summon is very expensive compared to EDS (Ebsco's product) so your library probably had to decide between keeping Summon or canceling journal subscriptions.  Alternately, you can keep EDS up in one tab, and search for citations you find in Scholar via EDS.  If you have access to the article via any database, EDS should find it for you."

I don't have Lyme - I have multiple sclerosis (the symptoms are apparently very similar). I started showing symptoms at 24, and was diagnosed at 25. I cannot imagine what it would be like dealing with this in high school. That really, really sucks.   First, don't worry about being behind. I'm about three years behind myself, and it has nothing to do with my illness. I changed programs 3 times and took some time to do internships. As a result, I'm 26 and just finishing of my master's degree now. There's no rush. You probably won't be able to get things done as quickly as other people, and that's really okay.   I don't know if you want to go to university, but if so, you should know that many (most?) institutions have an office for students with disabilities, and they can be extremely useful in helping you navigate college life. The OSD at my university, for example, can offer you a private room for writing exams, and they can give extra time, as well as breaks. I found the breaks helpful for dealing with pain in my hands. You can also do a reduced course load (many people without illnesses do this anyway).   You are not a failure. As you probably know, life isn't always kind to good people. Life is often really, really hard and terrible. There are tools out there to help you,  but ultimately, you're going to have a much harder time than most of your peers. It sucks, and its not fair... but we don't really have a choice.   Oh! I don't know anything about the Lyme subreddit, but I know the one for MS is really great, and has a lot of supportive people. I'd recommend checking out the Lyme subreddit and seeing what its like. Your trouble with focus is likely from both physical and mental symptoms, and a support network can be helpful in dealing with both.

I am not sure whether some of the more prestigious colleges care, but I'm guessing they'd take in consideration your circumstances which you most likely discuss in your college admission essay when you send in an application (along with your scores on state administered exams?). This is certainly a route to consider. High school is more about introducing you to a variety of subjects (as well as your first couple of years of college, actually, with mostly intro/required courses to cover). I would make an appointment with an admissions officer/advisor at one or two colleges (maybe even just a local college nearby that you don't plan on going to) and see what approach they recommend. I can't offer a professional's advice in this regard, just my own personal experience and sense of how these things work. For what it's worth, I do not in any way feel like I ""missed out"" by skipping those 3 years of high school."

But I would ask a college admissions person or professor who also works as an advisor how important a state exam score would be considering your particular circumstances. Also, a lot of community colleges offer courses even if you are not matriculated, and doing fairly well in those courses would show that you are capable of college-level work when you end up matriculating or applying elsewhere."

You might check to see if there's an online or computer-based program you can use to finish high school. Do what works for you.   As for college, don't rush. There is no shame whatsoever in taking your time. I finished my bachelor's degree at 26 and I'm starting grad school in the fall and I'm 29 now.

EDIT: In case it wasn't clear, I would love to hear why/if they were wrong. This has bugged me for years.

AskAcademia,3e25rf,HM_D,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:06:20 2015 UTC,"I can answer specifically how a broader view and a solid background in philosophy of science helped the science professors at my liberal arts university.  By nature of our undergraduate program, we teach courses primarily to non-science liberal arts majors.  The students are intelligent and articulate overall, but lack substantial science or math background.  That means that all our math and science classes must have broad motivations, and can't start technically narrow.    It hit me just how unusual it is for scientists to be able to speak science to laypeople when we couldn't fill a tenure-track position for chemistry until a fourth-year of the search.  Even among our top candidates, who knew they were interviewing for a position where one teaches to non-scientists, only a couple could converse in any meaningful way with non-scientists about the broad goals of their research, or even their more general research field.  So how does this relate to Kuhn?  Not directly.  It's not about specifically what Kuhn argues.  But reading works like Kuhn, or reading original works by Darwin, Bacon, or even Aristotle and Decartes, gives one a perspective that the paradigms through which we understand the world aren't obvious, and they aren't to be taken for granted.  It's not some postmodern relativism; Newtonial physics really are better at predictions than Aristotelian.  But it's fascinating that they were actually addressing very different questions.  Newton did not specify what gravity is, just how the force of gravity behaves; prediction was the point.  For ancient Greeks, Aristotle including, the essential logical nature of the world was the point, not predictions.  They didn't bother with experimentation.    History and philosophy of science is in part valuable precisely it can tease out which questions the contemporary societies were pursuing.  That, in turn, helps one consider which essential questions pervade the research thrust of current scientific endeavors.  The ability to identify and discuss these current essential questions enables one to talk to non-specialists, and also, I think, makes one better at research.    You are much less likely to get lost if you can see the big picture."

AskAcademia,3dvs1m,askprofscience,24,Sun Jul 19 23:04:11 2015 UTC,"Here's my advice, after mentoring a few undergrads over the last few years of my phd:  -Learn from the graduate students in the lab, especially if one is tasked with mentoring you. If they take the time to show you or teach you, take careful notes in your lab notebook. Don't pretend to know anything. The best scientists ask the most questions. Above all, remember that this graduate student(s) is not being paid to spend time and work with you you. Although there is commonly a ""pay it forward"" mentality towards undergrad research since we all start somewhere, remember that this grad student is spending his or her valuable time working with you and teaching you. Please respect their effort and time.    -Set up a schedule and show up at the times you committed to. I was often frustrated when my undergrads didn't show up and I had blocked out 3 hours to do something.   -Clean up after yourself. If you're sharing a bench with someone, leave it like you found it. But don't throw away random scraps of paper you find on a bench.   -It's fine to screw up. You will. It's how you respond to it that makes you stand out. Take the initiative and form a hypothesis as to why something failed, and your new plan of attack. Google it, youtube around, don't just ask for the answer. Make it a conversation; you will become a better scientific problem solver when you do.   -Plan to present your research in a poster format at your school's undergraduate research forum. Make this a goal with your PI and/or graduate student mentor.   -Lastly, have fun. Pipetting, discovering something new, having your first ""ah hah!"" moment, seeing chromosomes, purifying a protein, running a gel, using a new machine, doing something you've only read about or seen in a textbook -- whatever it is, take it as a new, badass experience and enjoy your time in the lab.

A couple of things you can do before you start:   Try to look up what the lab has been up to lately. Search for the papers published by the team during the last year and read the abstracts (and more if you understand what is said). It will give you some familiarity with the specific vocabulary and big trends. Brush up your computer skills. Depending on your field Office/Excel, Python, Matlab + whatever commonly available software you might use. I don't mind explaining how to use new equipment or how to process complicated data but it should not be the role of a graduate student to teach you the basics of programming. Moreover if you are comfortable with those tools you will be a lot faster and do more of the interesting stuff. Get a notebook Be curious! Try to learn what other people are doing, how the equipment works, why things are done this way and not that way. You will learn a lot. And it's often a good way to get involved into interesting projects.   Lastly when I have some bad periods in the lab I like to think off how much 10 years old me would be excited by all of this.

If you have not attended a LAC but want to teach at one, the best remedy is to seek out a one-semester teaching position at a LAC and do very well while you are in grad school. But that might be not be feasible, depending on your location. A second-best alternative would be to ask your department whether you can teach a section of Psych 101, or some big service course no one wants to teach."
AskAcademia,3du75f,Poor_and_Blind,3,Sun Jul 19 23:00:34 2015 UTC,"One of the most important factors in determining whether you can get a job at an LAC or SLAC is whether you yourself have attended one for college, because those schools seek someone who will immediately ""get"" the LAC culture.   It's really not that hard to ""get"" LAC culture. It's a teaching-oriented school that wants its professors to understand the value of a wide education for undergrads. It's not a cabal. There is no secret LAC handshake that graduating seniors have to take a 1-credit class on. Indeed, there is more within-LAC cultural variation than there is variation between LACs and non-LACs as a group. A stereotypical Wellesley grad wouldn't ""get"" the culture at Hampshire. An Oberlin student wouldn't like the culture at Williams. I mean, this statement doesn't even hold empirically. While there's a ton of LAC grads teaching at LACs (because LACs have disproportionately high representation in grad school cohorts), there's also a ton of non-LAC grads teaching in those same departments, and everybody gets along just fine."
AskAcademia,3du75f,riggorous,2,Mon Jul 20 09:11:42 2015 UTC,I stand happily corrected then; I had been told that they hadn't interviewed me simply because of my background. Thanks.
AskAcademia,3du75f,ampanmdagaba,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:11:40 2015 UTC,"I would not doubt feedback you have been given simply because of something somebody said on the internet, just as much as I wouldn't extrapolate your one experience to all situations and all people ever."
AskAcademia,3du75f,ampanmdagaba,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:14:40 2015 UTC,"I had been told that they hadn't interviewed me simply because of my background   It is still true that you have to have entries on your CV, and/or carefully planted statements in your cover letter and your teaching statement to cover up for the fact that you don't know slac culture. It is easy to do, relatively speaking, but it may need your attention. If there may be any stereotypes about you, based on your discipline, region of origin, school you went to, your goal is to carefully break and dispel these stereotypes in your application package."
AskAcademia,3du75f,riggorous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:06:26 2015 UTC,"There is no secret LAC handshake   For teachers, knowing the lingo, and being able to produce a meaningful statement about the goals of any given exercise or piece of material they teach in class, seems to serve that kind of ""shibboleth"" test. But 1) it's easy to learn, 2) it's actually useful. So it is all not that bad, and I agree with you."

This is a requirement at any teaching-oriented school. It's not ""shibboleth"" as much as it is ""do you know what the fuck you're doing, given you've spent 5 years without once stepping into a classroom""."
AskAcademia,3du75f,acidfast_sieben,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:11:56 2015 UTC,"You know, I also found that every now and then some faculty are perhaps unnecessarily attached to specific ""keywords"" and lingo that education studies use. I don't like this high-ed lingo myself (as you can probably guess); they always sounded really nice, but kind of trivial to me. ""Goal-oriented learning"", ""seven learning styles"", ""Bloom's taxonomy of knowledge"", ""deep learning"" and other stuff like that. Of course everybody want their learning be deep and goal-oriented! Who would argue against that! And not all of that lingo is even justified in the literature (the ""learning styles"" for example were never quite proven empirically).  But some people really like this lingo, and judge candidates based on whether they can use it smoothly during lunch. Knowing what you do is one thing, but being able to talk about it is quite another, and not even too deeply related task."
AskAcademia,3du75f,riggorous,0,Mon Jul 20 15:45:49 2015 UTC,"I agree. And the formal qualifications help, of with I saw 50% of attendees fail because they produced crap coursework."
AskAcademia,3du75f,riggorous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:58:18 2015 UTC,"I imagine this isn't directed at me, since I have taught a course before, but I'm worried that only having taught one class (if I were to apply next year) would be held against me."

I was being hyperbolic in my comment above; at the same time, I am not the best authority, especially on questions about the nitty-gritty. At this point, if you can't talk about applying to LACs with a mentor, I would haul ass over to the CHE forums. The job advice is miles better."

AskAcademia,3du75f,Kambingx,0,Mon Jul 20 20:09:41 2015 UTC,"Actually, in the UK, one better be well-versed in the standard pedagogical terminology mandated by the HEA (Higher Education Academy) and the UKPSF (UK Professional Standards Framework), so you are absolutely correct. In addition, it would be very useful to have formal qualifications in teaching (usually two years part-time at a Masters level) to be taken seriously. I say that as a hardcore STEM person as well.  Full details are here:  https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/UKPSF_2011_English.pdf  However, I should state that UK is probably the most organised country I have worked with in this regard (organised with respect to mandating a minimum level of pedagogical training) and even Germany can't compete with it's Habilitationsprozess."
AskAcademia,3du75f,AlkalineHume,2,Mon Jul 20 16:55:12 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's a bummer. I ended up going to public school (a big state school) because of money issues, but applied primarily to SLACs for undergrad. Maybe I can check out 1-year visiting assistant professorship jobs, there seem to be a lot of these."
AskAcademia,3du75f,Poor_and_Blind,3,Sun Jul 19 23:33:49 2015 UTC,"One of the most important factors in determining whether you can get a job at an LAC or SLAC is whether you yourself have attended one for college   I don't think it's true for SLACs. Or rather, that's a shortcut they tend to take (like in ""they went to X, so they know the culture""), but it's definitely not the only way to make a good impression. You need to show that you know the lingo; you need to show that you share the same loosely defined set of interests and goals. But it is all very doable.  I've seen several very non-SLAC-heritage people (in fact opposite of it) being hired into good places.  Make sure you read good books (like this one, and then this one). Seek to turn this theory into practice. Develop and teach a few courses (at least one, definitely). Shadow good teachers. There are ways."
AskAcademia,3du75f,AlkalineHume,2,Mon Jul 20 01:56:34 2015 UTC,"Maybe I can check out 1-year visiting assistant professorship jobs, there seem to be a lot of these.   I'd be careful about those. If they're at an LAC, they're teaching-intensive, which means they'll work you to death, you won't have time to research, and 1 year is too little time to make an impression on anyone. Few of them also convert into a TT position at the same institution. If you're gonna do a VAP, the 2-3 year ones are a much better deal; some LACs also have 5-year fellowships."
AskAcademia,3dtd79,swedkas,2,Sun Jul 19 07:03:14 2015 UTC,"Several things come to mind as being less than perfect.  ""Plz[sic] note vote here means upvote for posts."" Why not just use ""upvote"" then? Also it could be interpreted as ""vote"" = ""upvote for posts"" and then later your questions become odd, e.g. ""... to upvote for posts for valuable posts"". (This is a minor point obviously.)  Why do you add the word ""for"" everywhere? It appears you are asking questions like ""I have confidence in my ability to upvote valuable posts"", but adding ""for"" is an indirection, do you mean to catch responses from people who could upvote valuable posts, or on behalf of valuable posts?  Many of your questions do not have consistent answers for some users. For example, I may be very confident in my ability to upvote informative posts in my academic field, but not in completely unrelated fields.  Questions such as ""[V]oting for posts on social news sites would help others"" is highly speculative. Do you mean to ask ""I believe upvoting posts on social news sites helps others""?  Questions 13-17 are unclear about where the plural is being used. Do you mean to ask ""I prefer to upvote a post if it is consistent"" or ""I prefer to upvote posts that are consistent with one another""?  Also for 13-17 there is no real sense in what is meant by some of these, is ""ay bby u want sum fuk?"": complete (it is a complete post), consistent (???), accurate (sometimes), easy to understand (as a cultural reference yes), reliable (???).  Overall I think you need to tidy up the language and reduce ambiguous plurals. Also be clearer on what the questions are really asking. Lastly, many questions may better be served by a scale of ""Always, Usually, Sometimes, Rarely, Never""."
