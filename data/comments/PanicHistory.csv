If you had even a moment of doubt, rest assured that the questions highlighted in red on the infographic were asked to measure things beside rape.   The 1 in 5 number is extrapolated from the numbers for completed/attempted forced penetration and completed penetration facilitated by alcohol or drugs. If you take out the attempts and alcohol, you still end up with 12.3% ≈ 1 in 8 victims of forced penetration."
PanicHistory,3e04bs,Avent,10,Mon Jul 20 23:40:49 2015 UTC,"So correct me if I read this wrong, but I went down the rabbit hole a little bit and read some of that study and the MRA complaints. At first their complaint that the definition of ""rape"" didn't include the ""forced to penetrate"" descriptor seemed legitimate (if mainly semantic), but their other main concern seems to be about women forcing men to penetrate them not being counted...the study mentions that they account for this, but it never happened. They surveyed over 7400 men, and not one said they were forced to penetrate a woman.   I found that on the exact same page where they're complaining about the rape definition (pg. 17: ""Being forced to penetrate someone else includes female perpetrators attempting to force male victims to penetrate them, though this did not happen"")! It's literally a bullet point down. Am I wrong, or are they not reading on, or are they simply lying?  EDIT: so it seems the ""attempting"" term is important, as earlier in this paragraph the definition says ""being made to vaginally penetrate a female using one's own penis"" was accounted for. I now understand this as meaning there were completed forced coital penetrations, just no attempts. I was simply lead to believe that this form of penetration wasn't that prevalent as the majority of male rapes were perpetrated by men. Again, this was fallacious because this is about ""forced penetration"" and not ""rape,"" according to the study's own definitions."

PanicHistory,3e04bs,Avent,2,Tue Jul 21 14:25:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I did read it. Again, I added the caveat that I could be wrong cause I'm a dummy. ""forced to penetrate"" includes many orifices and means, not just penis into vagina. And there is an earlier mention of the majority of men being victim of rape and stalking (and other non-contact aggression) suffering at the hands of men, which lead me to believe that the 1 in 21 figure had more to do with something other than forced coitus. I believe the quote you're challenging isn't about women being forced to penetrate, but rather the keyword was ""attempts."" Regardless, I'll edit my main post."

PanicHistory,3e04bs,CalicoZack,2,Tue Jul 21 12:40:29 2015 UTC,"""Though it did not happen"" is separating out a category of attempted forced penetration, as opposed to completed. So for example, if a female abuser tries to force vaginal penetration, but the victim doesn't get an erection, it still counts as forced penetration.  4.8% of men reported having been made to penetrate in one way or another. I assume at least some of these were vaginal."
PanicHistory,3e04bs,Avent,2,Tue Jul 21 14:48:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there isn't really that detailed of a breakdown, but one thing that made the ""assume at least some of these were vaginal"" dubious for me was that ""Male rape victims and male victims of non-contact unwanted sexual experiences reported predominantly male perpetrators,"" that's why the earlier ""this never happened"" quote made me think that 4.8% number had more to do with anal or oral penetration, or with a tongue, hand, etc. But of course, that was only for rape and non-contact events, so I simply inferred the wrong thing.  As you and the other user pointed out, the quote I cited is only for attempts. No female attempted and failed, it seems. There were only completed forced vaginal penetrations, which were some (we don't know how much?) percentage of the 4.8% number of total forced penetrations by men.  Thanks for the correction"

Billionaires and their children are getting wealthier and more clueless, neither of which show any signs of abating. Everyone else is getting poorer, relatively, considerably more angry, and open to the idea that violence is the answer.  Après moi, le déluge"

Cannabis consumption is perfectly normal behavior for adults and has been for thousands of years, yet is still criminalized in 36 states.  A few other plants and chemicals are criminalized in all 50.  In inner cities, police most certainly do use this pretext as a lens by which to view their entire constituency as criminals.  This isn't some secret or a fact in dispute.  It's been established by study after study.  Heck, even the police are sick of it.   I can't imagine anything in a normal person's day is concerning to police.   That's not really the issue in determining whether this comment is sufficiently hyperbolic to belong on this sub.  Rather, it's the inverse: are police concerning to a ""normal person.""

Or it is at the least not available in the public domain. I would be more than happy to learn that misconduct is on the decline, but if you run a google search for police misconduct, you get a lot of semi-accurate estimates and news articles. You get nothing which can be used to show a trend one way or the other. I would contend to you that this is the problem. If no one knows what the numbers are, how could we fix it if it is out of control? Why aren't these numbers recorded or accessible? Seriously, I can find almost any other criminal statistic, but not if it relates to police misconduct. The public deserves accountability, and though transparency and accountability are both on the rise in law enforcement, we literally don't know if it is getting better or worse, because of the way records have been kept up until now.   What rock do you live under? The public is more aware than ever of police wrongdoings. There have been crops of police watchdog groups popping up and we have Obama addressing the police in a critical manner unheard of from a president in office. Police body cameras will likely be the norm in 10 years and I don't know how much better you can get for police accountability than body cams.  Sounds like you just want to preach to the reddit choir without actually acknowledging that public sentiment has been changing. And apart from all of that, we don't live in anything NEAR a fucking police state!  I have plenty of issues with our legal/prison system in America. I'm glad to see it become a hot issue and I agree that it should be an even more pressing matter. However, seeing terms like ""orwellian"" and ""police state"" thrown around for easy upvotes/likes just makes you look loopy to anyone that isn't huffing the same paranoid, anti-police fumes as you on a daily basis. Turn off your computer and take a trip, interact with people, then come back and tell me how what you experienced was that of a person with zero civil liberties and a constant police intrusion.    Also, I love the seeing the argument, ""Crime is at an all time low yet police spending is at all time high! This is an outrage!"" in that thread.

PanicHistory,3dixqo,lazypilgrim,-6,Fri Jul 17 01:35:24 2015 UTC,"I think that's some panic history in and of itself: political correctness can go too far, and half of TiA are a bunch of submissions showing just that.  People arguing otherwise seem to be taking the position that political correctness cannot possibly be taken to a farcical extreme. That seems...odd. What else can't be taken too far? I'm not sure I can think of anything. Moderation in everything, including moderation.  Watching this unfold on reddit, wherein people are categorizing folks as either super SJWs or MRA guys, with no in between, is fascinating.   Edit: The only logical conclusion for the downvotes is that people think political correctness cannot be taken to an extreme. Is that what panichistory is really devolving to? ""No! Something I like couldn't possibly be bad in excess!"" One of the few bastions of rationality on this website slowly turning into the rest of it? Wow."

More or less the kinds of things that would make you lose an election. Criticizing the military, for example, is not politically correct in the US, certainly without a huge disclaimer on how that criticism is purely theoretical.  That does mean that it usually covers ""not being a raging arsehole"" but there are (and should be) a lot of things that aren't outright obviously offensive covered as well and, sadly, quite a few ""raging arsehole"" things are politically correct.

I can only imagine it's coming from KiA, I don't think any regulars here would disagree with that sentiment.  I've can't even understand the TiA/KiA mindset. They expand their anti-SJW/anti-feminist ideas into the very ugly racism/sexism/ homo/trans-phobia that they insist doesn't exist (or isn't a problem). It's completely counter-intuitive.  For me it would be the equivalent of someone from the 1960s opposing the civil rights movement led by MLK simply because some radical, black national said something they don't like.  A moderate would (or at least should) understand the difference between the two, and certainly not swing in the opposite direction and become a full-fledged racist. And yet that is exactly what TiA/KiA encourages."

PanicHistory,3dixqo,lazypilgrim,6,Fri Jul 17 01:42:21 2015 UTC,I think your lack of understanding comes from the fact that you think that the people in TiA/KiA are similar to you except for the fact that they hold these specific views (that you don't agree with).  I do not think this is correct. I think that a fair margin of people on those subs hold very different views from you (views you would probably find appalling) and go to TiA/KiA simply because it is the one place that they can express at least a portion of what they really think.
PanicHistory,3dixqo,Disingenuous_,0,Fri Jul 17 00:06:04 2015 UTC,"implying I myself don't hold those views  implying I think holding those views is wrong  Perhaps the distinction then is not between the views people hold, but how having an extreme opinion affects their identity. Does it begin to define them? Or is just one more aspect of their nuanced personality? What we dislike then isn't the views themselves, but the degree to which they push their opinions on others."

PanicHistory,3dixqo,Disingenuous_,-2,Fri Jul 17 09:54:25 2015 UTC,I think the bias you are expressing is no different than what they say about the sjw's or really any group that doesn't like any other group.   I have no idea why this is such a contentious viewpoint on this sub.  This isn't circlebroke. This isn't SRS. This is a sub that relishes practicality and realism in politics.   Why suddenly it's on the prowl for evil anti-SJWs is a mystery.
PanicHistory,3dixqo,itsfineitsgreat,0,Fri Jul 17 10:07:45 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you! I'm just finding on the subs I frequent that they're using the same exact argumentation: the panicky gamer gaters are decrying any castigation of them being dicks as ""infringing on their free speech"" etc etc.  And then on circlebroke and SRS you have people saying that mocking anyone saying black people can't be racist is racist and neckbeardy etc etc, and it's just so stupid.  There's dumb arguments on both sides, and it's sad to see /r/panichistory slide away from realizing that and instead joining in the dumb.  Like we have someone in this thread arguing that the whole ""political correctness gone wild"" stance was never legitimate and was instead a Trojan horse to attack all progressivism.  That's on par with saying that the whole progressive thing was never legitimate and instead a Trojan horse to institute communism.  It's wildly stupid and incredibly panicky...and it's upvoted here? That's not good."

PanicHistory,3dixqo,--o,3,Fri Jul 17 15:24:10 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean that's what I got from "" r/TiA was fun in the beginning but it quickly devolved like this.""  Even then, to take it as an absolute is silly. The implication is ""the more ornery commenters (and their upvoters) of TiA/KiA"" (KiA implied since that's the topic of the submission)  Or even ""people who use SJW un-ironically for any sort of progressive thing""  But it's an awfully small hill to die on."
PanicHistory,3dixqo,SinlessSinnerSinning,-3,Fri Jul 17 16:10:35 2015 UTC,"So it's not ill defined but it could be any group that fits the very hard line description, if it's not /r/TiA they didn't mean /r/TiA, if it does they did.

I don't know where this ""you can't laugh at people being farcical about political correctness unless you're a gamergater or neckbeard"" thing originated, but it's just not true.  We have a bizarre contingent on this sub that seems to be arguing against the idea of anyone making entertainment out of these examples, as if there's no way their worldview could have a comical extreme, as if somehow there's this one thing in the world that can't have a crazy extreme.

But that's not really possible when seemingly grounded people start calling other's neckbeards (fuck off I have bigger problems then shaving, yes people do mean it quite literally, please don't defend it) or are general purpose prejudiced assholes.  That goes for both /r/panichistory as well as /r/tumblrinaction as both have a sizable set of sane people but also, sadly, have a sizable set of people who I occasionally get downvoted to hell for disagreeing with.

The submission said that they were acting normal as a Trojan horse for their secret crazy beliefs. The guy you're responding to said the crazy ones were always crazy.  People saying black people can't be racist or women are enslaved or whatever have always been crazy, we all know that.  What the submission was trying to do was wrap all liberal philosophies into that crazy. The guy you're responding to was saying that conflation is illegitimate and disingenuous.  The issue I'm having with otherwise competently-minded subs is that they can't separate criticism of the crazies I noted with criticism of all liberal philosophies. They, like the guy who wrote the submission that spawned this thread, are having trouble understanding that A is not B and B is not A. And this sub should really be smarter than that.

But with reservoirs near and at historical lows, more rainfall can be captured as runoff, diminishing temporarily the disadvantage from the relatively less useful form of precipitation. Our waterworks are massively over-engineered relative to our basic needs, being designed to handle so much unnecessary landscaping."

PanicHistory,3cxtds,oh_no_aliens,3,Sun Jul 12 04:19:25 2015 UTC,"You might need to find another source. The only mention of 'precipitation' in the article is in the 'cause' section:    NASA climatologist William Patzert predicts that if the [Pacific Decadal Oscillation] is at work here, there will be widespread climatological consequences and southern California and the American South may be in for a period of high precipitation, with an increase in the rate of global warming.    I could imagine how, geographically and temporally that could be linked to the Ridiculously Resilient Ridge which has been blamed for so much of the rain shortfall the last two years, but... I'd like to see some research informing that connection."
PanicHistory,3cxtds,dart200,-2,Sun Jul 12 07:30:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it's the RRR, due to The Blob upwelling. It's heat that's been storing in the deep ocean coming back to haunt us. lol. Yeah, I'm still piecing all this stuff together. And, I just found out I was half wrong. So there is a huge plume of vapor coming up from El Nino, but it either can slam into the West Coast, or run along the RRR into Alaska. A Canadian meteorologists was talking about how winter might be ""canceled"" for Alberta, perhaps due to the a weather block from the RRR.  Here's my favorite source: https://robertscribbler.wordpress.com/  His latest post about El Nino, has some interesting comments from him:   There’s an amazing plume of moisture surging up over the Pacific. An ongoing flood that is now 10 months involved and building with each passing day. It slammed into Alaska as the worst storm on record there last November. If the block falls, that plume takes a right hand turn, gets an even greater moisture boost and the slams directly into the West Coast. But the size of the equatorial T anomaly required, with the Arctic warming so much and with sea ice so weak, is absolutely astounding. So we do have this kind of wicked synergy between global warming, related polar amplification, a monster El Niño, and concerns over extraordinary weather.  Prepare for the possibility of some of the worst storms ever recorded in the modern climate record if the block fails. If the block maintains, the very bad weather is heading for Alaska instead."

That is not what I said, that is not what I meant.  I spent my younger years cleaning out horse stall. So I know horses fart & poop all day long. One time I jumped on bare when Mr O was near a dirt hill. Ears went back & he tried taking me right into a tree branch. I jumped off, was on him less then 2 seconds, he starts kicking and farting as he ran off around the yard. That's what they do, eat->poo->fart.   A horse is not a human. But just as cars took the jobs of horse transportation, self driving cars will take trucker & taxi driver's jobs.  Just as automation took factory jobs, AI & general purpose robots will replace white collar workers.   That does not mean everyone will be out of work.

PanicHistory,3c86c0,farmingdale,13,Sun Jul 5 23:45:18 2015 UTC,"For one thing, there is no legal mechanism for Greece to leave or to be expelled. This was never even considered a possibility and therefore we would be in legal terra incognita. Some say that clever layers will find a way, but so far there doesn't seem to be any kind of solution for this.  Secondly, people worry about the signal a Greek exit would send regarding the Eurozone's strength and unity. There is also fear of potential contagion risk that might affect the other weaker member states (e.g. Spain, Portugal, Italy). On the other hand, one might ask whether Greek staying wouldn't do more damage. Without Goldman Sachs' help cooking their books they would have never become a member in the first place.  Lastly, uniting Europe has been a political priority for a long time. Having Greece leave the Euro could be seen as taking a step backwards and the potential beginning of the unravelling of the whole project. None of the major players on the EU side wants their name associated with that. This is especially true for Merkel who could enter history as the chancellor who destroyed Europe given her prominent role in all of this (well, technically she would be the 2nd one to do so)."

And those swaps were allowed under Eurozone rules  http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/greek-debt-crisis-how-goldman-sachs-helped-greece-to-mask-its-true-debt-a-676634.html  ""Around 2002 in particular, various investment banks offered complex financial products with which governments could push part of their liabilities into the future,"" one insider recalled, adding that Mediterranean countries had snapped up such products.  Greece's debt managers agreed a huge deal with the savvy bankers of US investment bank Goldman Sachs at the start of 2002.

Argentina had a more classic default situation that they are still dealing with. They kind of dropped out of the first world for a while but have since recovered a bit. But their economy is still in flux 15 years later. Same kind of deal with Russia, which suddenly went under in 1998 and really hasn't recovered yet.  So it could go either way with Greece.

This has been called ""one of the best-known sentences in the English language"",[7] containing ""the most potent and consequential words in American history"".[8] The passage came to represent a moral standard to which the United States should strive. This view was notably promoted by Abraham Lincoln, who considered the Declaration to be the foundation of his political philosophy, and argued that the Declaration is a statement of principles through which the United States Constitution should be interpreted.[9]  In the same spirit and veracity as our Founding Fathers before us, let us argue for and write a new Declaration of Privacy.  Thomas Pain, Thomas Jefferson, Samual Adams, they showed us how articulation can help start a revolution, who among us could write our Declaration of Independence from the NSA?  Reddit, what follows is my first draft edits of the original Declaration Please help me edit this into a proper document reflective of the Tyranny of the NSA and our declaration to stand against it.  The unanimous Declaration of the Fifty United States of America against the Tyranny of the National Security Agency  When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and data are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness without invasion of privacy by the National Security Agency.  -That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,  -That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new Government Security Agency, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Agencies of Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of NSA abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government Agency, and to provide new Guards for their future security.  -Such has been the patient sufferance of these united States; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Agency of Government. The history of the present National Security Agency is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these United and Free States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.  -They have refused Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.  -They have lobbied together legislative bodies for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with their measures.  -They have coerced into silence Representatives repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness their invasions on the rights of the people.  -They have refused for a long time, the Legislative powers, incapable of returning to the People at large their liberty and instead leveling all the dangers of privacy invasion from without, and convulsions within.  -They have endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for liberty and privacy; refusing to pass others to encourage their freedoms hither, and raising the conditions of new control and spying over Lands and information.  -They have obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing their Assent to Laws for establishing liberty powers of privacy.  -They have kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies of hackers, poised to collect every and everything that moves over the connected Internet without the Consent of our legislatures and free people.  -They have plundered our mobile devices, ravaged our Facebook accounts, and destroyed the lives of our people who are even suggested as having anything to do with terrorism.  Signed  The Free People of the United States of America  Maybe one day our children will celebrate the 4th along with Snowden's name; the 4th can be day of liberty and the constant reminder our privacy is lost."

However, there have been a few landmark cases:  In Samuel vs the state of Florida the federal district court ruled that the Disney monorail could be considered a subway.  However in Moore vs Sutherland it was ruled that the above ground trolley in San Fransisco did not count as a subway. Which led to a judgement against of Moore of 10 US dollars.  The biggest case to date has been the controversial supreme court ruling on the case of Brandy vs the LIRR. The ruling pushed by Scalia, a textualism, argued that the Transvestite Ms. Brandy did not count as a ""man"" and would have to keep her legs together on the LIRR.

I'm actually thinking more of financial sense. Why would you move a company to SF, arguably the priciest place in America?   Because it isn't too pricey if you're making a six-figure salary in the tech field. If you move to San Francisco for a tech job, things aren't nearly as relatively pricey as it is for somebody who just works the local Burger King.   I completely can understand wanting to move everyone to save on multiple offices and centralizing them, but SF? There's no reason to move there given how cheap office space is elsewhere. It's pure status of location, cliquish behavior, and a way to trim some personnel you don't like all rolled into one   I like how these people live in a world where companies make decisions for reasons that aren't ultimately about making money. Why are so many financial firms based in New York City and London? I bet those places are pricey. Why doesn't a New York brokerage firm just relocate to Little Rock to save on rent? Could it be because New York City and London are global financial hubs?  No, clearly, New York brokerage firms are just trying to turn their employees into dirty Yankee fans."

The admins seem to be mostly about putting out fires instead of developing a sitewide culture, so they don't seem to be trying to attract any particular talent there, either. Is there any good reason for them to be located in NYC or San Francisco or any other high-priced city, rather than getting costs under control by setting up shop in, like, Omaha? Or is there behind-the-scenes interaction with the tech movers and shakers that I'm just not aware of?"
PanicHistory,3c0xr9,mattwan,10,Fri Jul 3 22:36:49 2015 UTC,The operations and scale are extreme challenges. Etsy has like 500 people on their tech team. Reddit is operating with what I would consider an absolute skeleton crew.

Oh sorry I meant LOL PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT STUFF R DUM"
PanicHistory,3bk5fz,djisadud,7,Tue Jun 30 16:22:10 2015 UTC,"That's not the whole truth. Economists do not deny we lost jobs, but the average cost of goods decreases (Therefore 340 million people benefit but barely a million do not)  http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_0dfr9yjnDcLh17m  It is illogical to weigh everything by job loss or job growth. No-skill jobs were already leaving America, that's why American jobs created since NAFTA have mostly been above-median (American workers are used because of high productivity).  The first part of this is, while wage doesn't exactly equal MPL because the labor market isn't perfect due to information asymmetry, bargaining power, and so on, wages are strongly correlated with MPL. American workers earn more because American companies who employ those workers earn more because of those companies' access to American markets and relatively wealthier American consumers. Nothing whatsoever about the NAFTA changes this.  The second part of this is, if we reduce barriers to international trade and that allows American consumers access to the same goods they were buying before for less money, the real value of their dollar will increase. Hand-wringing over the possibility that nominal wages for low-skilled workers will decrease because other countries have comparative advantage in producing certain goods completely ignores the critical reality of the changeable real buying power of a dollar. This misunderstanding underpins most objections to the TPP and free trade in general."
PanicHistory,3bk5fz,Jackalopecia,10,Wed Jul 1 16:39:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I asked the fucking question, retard.  I don't know if it's as clear cut as you're making it out to be anyway.  ""U.S. employment increased over the period of 1993-2007 from 110.8 million people to 137.6 million people.[9] Specifically within NAFTA's first five years of existence, 709,988 jobs (140,000 annually), were created domestically.[10] The mid to late nineties was a period of strong economic growth in the United States. Classical macroeconomic theory suggests that when a country is experiencing economic growth (i.e. GDP is increasing), then there will also be an increase in the participation of the labor force.[11] Thus, because trade liberalization can sometimes contribute to increases in GDP, it can help to bring the rate of unemployment down in a country. The U.S. experienced a 48% increase in real GDP from 1993-2005. The unemployment rate over this period was an average of only 5.1%, compared to 7.1% from 1982-1993, before NAFTA was implemented.[10] Critics on NAFTA argue that the 1990s economic boom was driven by technological change, however, and that employment growth in the 1990s would have been even greater without NAFTA.[12]""  Seems like there is no real consensus, which is why I asked the question."

Judge Leon in that one decided that the NSA's actions were unconstitutional and that the precedent set by Smith wasn't sufficient, but didn't feel he had the authority to make that declaration.  The Supreme Court of course didn't review the case. But it's an interesting read nonetheless.   That kind of data collection really does make up a great bulk of intelligence gathered on US citizens... But those people gave express permission to the companies to use that information as they see fit.

PanicHistory,3baytb,Bull3tM0nk3y,35,Sat Jun 27 14:05:07 2015 UTC,"Free trade agreements are how countries adjust their trade relationships to get out of the old, bad ways of doing trade. Traditionally, countries use tariffs and other mechanisms to protect industries that they consider valuable to have domestically. Such action isn't always bad, but it results in inefficiencies, because the economies are unable to take advantage of comparative advantage.  The worthiness of free trade is uncontroversial among economists, despite the expectation that some participants will have higher unemployment in the short term. The overall gains for the economy are just that good. The reasons for it being so good are many and varied, but you can have a look at the USA's objectives here.  Gains are even higher for developing economies. Vietnam's GDP growth may even quadruple, and while predicting that specifically would be silly, the benefit is clearly great. Here is even more information.  However since you are on Reddit, you are obligated to ignore legitimate sources of information in favor of disreputable fringe sources. Here is an excellent list of idiots and conspiracy nuts who are opposed to TPP. As you can see, TPP is unpopular with people who go under the pen name ""Tyler Durden"", leftist fossils who can't stand seeing capitalism (and Vietnam) succeed, Pat Buchanan, and Julian Assange. They would have you believe that the FBI will spontaneously pivot to enforcement against people torrenting a movie a day or poor workers who need Photoshop or Visual Studio, and conveniently leave out the fact that IP protections are aimed at China's infamous routine violation of foreign IP.  It's also amusing to mention that Reddit's outrage over TPP news being 'suppressed' is based entirely on ignorance and an unwillingness to read things that don't conform to existing histrionics.  Overall, this is a win-win policy that contributes to you not being as poor. Whatever you do, you'll be able to export it more, or your customers will be able to export what they do more. And you'll be able to use the money you get to import more and better products."

PanicHistory,3baytb,JambaJoose,4,Sun Jun 28 04:30:47 2015 UTC,"There is a clause for dispute resolution as there is in any trade agreement. Basically it allows a country or company to bring a case before the governing body of the trade deal to accuse another country or company of violating the terms of the deal. If they are successful, they can issue some punishment. The punishment need not be overturning laws. They might just allow the plaintiff to impose tariffs that are otherwise banned.  The TPP judges have no executive authority. They can't compel compliance. Just declare a country in violation and approve some remediation. Compliance is essentially voluntary since countries can always just withdraw from the deal if it proves too much trouble.  The WTO has been doing it for decades."

PanicHistory,3baytb,PhysicsIsMyMistress,8,Sun Jun 28 17:08:44 2015 UTC,"Basically there are a few common complaints, all of them from ignorance or intentional ignoring of facts:   ""Lose your internet"" will 100% never happen as part of TPP or anything else under consideration. The agreement strengthens IP enforcement, but that is targeted at nations like China and Vietnam who are notorious for not respecting copyrights and patents. And this isn't aimed mostly at media either, China builds knockoff drugs, clothes, electronics and cars all designed or researched by western companies. WHOLE CARS! They build a piece by piece exact copy of a Ford or a Peugeot but put a different brand label on it and there's currently not much the rest of the world can do about it. That is what we are trying to stop, not occasional use of pirate bay. ""It was negotiated in secret"" ignores the fact that almost every international agreement, since the dawn of international agreements, are negotiated in secret. If the press are there during the negotiation, people will feel like they need to politically posture and not be brutally honest as they negotiate. It's one of those rare times when transparency is not always a good thing. ""It will cost American Jobs"" is also a common one but it's only true if you ignore the bigger picture. Increased trade with Asia will mean the US will buy more things from Asia. However, it also means that Asia will buy more things from the US. That will increase both nation's economies overall and lead to job creation on both sides. And it will also bring the cost of goods down in the mean time. Trade is a net good for both parties when you look at the whole economy. Unfortunately, while the good it does is spread out, the hurt can be very concentrated. If a factory shuts down because it would rather work out of Vietnam than Indiana, no ammount of economics lessons or talk about the ""greater benefits"" are going to make those people who lost jobs feel better about losing their job. It's globalized benefit with localized hurt."
PanicHistory,3baytb,auandi,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:46:29 2015 UTC,"However, it also means that Asia will buy more things from the US.   This only works if the playing field is even. If an Asian country is using child or prison labor, no, they'll have still have no incentive to buy from us if they can have 9-year-olds make the same goods and dump their waste right into the local drinking supply.  That's the good of (honest) tariffs. Everyone buys your sneakers because you use prison labor to make them cheap? Let me just add on what it would have cost you to pay those workers and now the playing field is even. Your cars are cheaper because of lower environmental standards? Let me tack on a tariff that adds on the cost you should have paid for proper environmental controls.   Now, tariffs that just close off foreign markets can be a good thing, but America doesn't really have much of those anymore. Hence, getting rid of tariffs tends to get rid of fair policies and then a race towards the lowest common denominator happens as countries with high standards of living have to compete with the bottom of the barrel and then pressure begins to drive wages, regulations and standards down to compete."

Well who's buying all these American produced things then? By your logic, no one would ever buy from the US since it's obviously so expensive to produce here compared to China or India. And sure, the US can't create a t-shirt for the same price, but what about complex things? Or things that require training and skill?"
PanicHistory,3baytb,auandi,3,Sun Jun 28 22:34:47 2015 UTC,"China doesn't produce everything it needs, however.  In 2008 New Zealand exported $521million worth of dairy products to China.  They signed a free trade agreement that year, and by 2010 (I think) New Zealand's dairy exports to China were worth 1.3billion.  Source  The Chinese Milk Scandal in 2008 also helped New Zealand in this regard, however, it is not just dairy products which have seen an increase in export to China.  New Zealand exports to China have tripled since the agreement was signed.  Notably, since the agreement New Zealand exports to China have increased by significantly more than Chinese exports to New Zealand, 32% and 2.8% respectively.  Source  In short, if a free trade deal for China can be this good for New Zealand thenthe United States with its larger, more diverse economy, relative abundance of land, and significantly larger population, should also be able to benefit from such an agreement."

PanicHistory,3b89qt,AHedgeKnight,2,Mon Jun 29 02:42:22 2015 UTC,"Not like overthrow the government. More like a complete overhaul of the system.  I mean a revolution in the sense of breaking the 2 party system in favour of something more open, because I do think the United States needs to end the 2 party system. Which would, technically, revolutionize the government. How that would be accomplished I do not know.  Perhaps simply an election where every incumbent gets voted out. I am in favour of term limits on ALL elected officials but that's because I do not believe being a politician should be a career. It makes things too vulnerable to corruption & stagnation.   Now I'm not saying the world is going to end or we're all going to become indentured servants. I'm just saying I think things could be better if things got a bit of a shake up, but again NOT overthrowing the government and definitely NOT violence."
PanicHistory,3b89qt,Cmrade_Dorian,2,Mon Jun 29 02:57:59 2015 UTC,"The way to achieve it would be to introduce preferential voting (which is apparently called 'instant run-off' outside of Australia) and/or proportional representation, so people can vote for third parties without their vote almost certainly being wasted.   But beyond that, the US has guaranteed freedom of speech and assembly, and regular free and fair elections. If a significant portion of the public wanted to organise and vote for a third party then there is nothing that would stop them. But they don't, which I take to mean that most people don't really want a third party, which in turn means that the only way to ""break the 2 party system"" would be to also break democracy - and I don't see how any reasonable person could support that."
PanicHistory,3b89qt,possibly_a_sheep,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:50:06 2015 UTC,"It's difficult when the majority of the public only sees 2 parties. In the U.S. we really don't have open elections. Yes anyone can run but the amount of time and more importantly money it takes means many people can't.  You can say the elections are fair but when Joe has $10 million in campaign funds and has enough spare $ / is high enough up the chain he can take off work to go campaign around the country & John has $10 and 2 kids to feed on his average wage... well we are all fairly certain who is going to win.   If a significant portion of the public wanted to organise and vote for a third party then there is nothing that would stop them.   While true in theory in practice this is not possible. Look at any major news media outlet during a presidential race. It's always A vs B. It's never who will win out of this group of 7. It's always Dems V Repubs. Barrack V Romney, Bush V Clinton.  Another issue is SCOTUS ruled that money is free speech. Which means the more money you have the more speech you have. With unlimited secret campaign donations the election is far from fair. Say 1,000 people give $10 each to their favorite candidate. That's $10,000. Now Uncle Pennybags gives $100,000 to the competitor. Is it fair that Uncle pennybags essentially has the ""free speech"" equivalent of 10,000 people?  I see your argument & in theory it is sound, but in practice is doesn't quite work out how one would hope.  The U.S. election system is definitely not fair. It could be worse yes, but it is far from fair. Sure anyone can claim to be running but in many places to even get on the ballot you need a significant number of signatures and not everyone has the time & money it takes to even register as a viable candidate let alone win."

PanicHistory,3b3bin,itsfineitsgreat,24,Thu Jun 25 19:18:14 2015 UTC,"States attempted to leave the union because the incoming administration said that they would begin to admit more Free States, thus the number of Senators who supported abolition would be higher than the number that supported slavery.

Like I said, I'm in favor of a stronger federal government but let's not kid ourselves that the civil war signaled the death knell for the opposite side of that argument.  I'm not sure why ignoring that has become e-trendy. I'd imagine in response to racists. But swinging too far to the other side of the argument for a good reason still doesn't make it so."

PanicHistory,3b3bin,CaptainScuttlebottom,16,Thu Jun 25 20:33:30 2015 UTC,State's rights were already significantly eroded with passing the Constitution over the Articles of Confederation.

State's rights were never anything more than an excuse to continue morally repugnant behavior.

(and I think it was really well put), I would certainly agree that slavery wasn't the only reason for the rebellion for everyone. But, at the same time, slavery WAS the heart of the conflict. There would have been no secession, and thus no war, without the looming possibility of an end to slavery rising before the southern states. As many others in this thread have said, it was about states' rights, but the ""right"" to keep slavery was really the only one in contention.  The conflict arose on the issue of slavery, was fought on the issue of slavery, and  Reconstruction was almost entirely focused on slavery. While some specific rebels might have been fighting ""for their homeland"", or for the ""Southern way of life"", the Civil War was first and foremost (and essentially entirely) an armed rebellion against the decline of slavery in the United States.   That said, you bring up a good point, and I wish you weren't being downvoted for doing so."

You could not leave the confederacy (despite that being how the confederacy formed) and you could never become a free state. That was written in their founding documents. They also had no equivalent to a bill of rights to limit government action, and the central government had more enumerated powers than the Constitution granted.  It wasn't about state's rights, not at the time. That narrative was advanced by neo-confederates during and after reconstruction. It was used to discredit federal occupation and keep the federal government from forcing legal equality for all races.   The founding documents of the confederacy, and the people who founded it, are calling you a historical liar. It wasn't about states rights at the time, and claiming it was about states rights after the fact is nothing but erasing the truth of the civil war from history."

PanicHistory,3b3bin,itsfineitsgreat,4,Fri Jun 26 21:08:36 2015 UTC,"No, it wasn't part of it. However, when the war ended, people like the VP of the Confederacy began retconning the whole thing and painting it as a states' rights issue. Meanwhile,a few weeks before the war, he gave the infamous ""Cornerstone Speech"" pinning the whole point of the Confederacy and its new Constitution as establishing under law the inferiority of the black race and the moral justification of slavery.   That was the state's ""right"" being fought over. And let's remember that after the war they formed the KKK and began disenfranchising freed blacks for over a hundred years then followed up with Jim Crow laws, then called out the national guard to keep black children from going to white schools, then pledged segregation forever. We could probably take it up through banning gay marriage, butterfly ballots and ""Jews for Buchanan"", but the point is the only thing they've continued to struggle for after the Civil War for the next 150 years has been the right to disenfranchise minority groups of their human rights.   EDIT: Wikipedia:    Considering the relative weight given to causes of the Civil War by contemporary actors, historians such as Chandra Manning  argue that both Union and Confederate fighting soldiers believed that slavery caused the Civil War. Union men mainly believed  the war was to emancipate the slaves. Confederates fought to protect southern society, and slavery as an integral part of  it.Addressing the causes, Eric Foner would relate a historical context with multidimensional political, social and economic  variables. The several causes united in the moment by a consolidating nationalism. A social movement that was individualist,  egalitarian and perfectionist grew to a political democratic majority attacking slavery, and slavery's defense in the Southern  pre-industrial traditional society brought the two sides to war.   The only states' rights issues mentioned were the right to ""take your property anywhere and not have it taken away from you"", which meant the right to take their slaves to free states and not have them emancipated and to have their runaway slaves returned to them, and the right to secede - which was done, of course, to protect slavery.   It all comes back to slavery."

In fact, let's just ban ANY pic just to be on the safe side.  This is really just a censorship issue. There's porn of all kinds on every single site out there. There's BARELY LEGAL TEEN porn which is extremely popular. Hell, even Brooke Shields and Traci Lords put underage porn into MAINSTREAM MOVIES.  Sure we shouldn't be sexualizing naked children, but if you're going to start banning legal content just for the sake of hoping to catch illegal content, how is that any different than an officer firing into the crowd of a fleeing robber with a shotgun just to make sure he gets the bad guy?  Do just like any other site: do your DUE DILIGENCE to remove any illegal content just as any site would. But it's definitely not your responsibility to police ALL content. That's just impossible. Even 4chan is notorious for DAILY KIDDIE PORN PICS. but the mods remove them as soon as they can because they CAN'T be held accountable for other people's posts otherwise reddit would likewise be held liable for ANY instance of an illegal pic.  Even Iggy Azalea made a child porn video where she tried to seduce an underage little boy with her pussy. That was allowed on YOUTUBE. So let's not get ahead of ourselves here. It's really not about the images themselves as much as the gatekeepers in charge of SEXUALIZING THE CONTEXT according to their feminist agenda.  I've seen pics on reddit of parents and strangers posting pics of naked kids playing in a bathtub or near the shower. If ALL naked children are to be removed, those would fall under 'illegal'.  If something is sexualizing a child in an obvious manner, we can remove it, no problem. But if someone is using their feminist liberal agenda to say ""THAT is sexual TO ME"" then we should tell them to fuck off. I mean social justice warriors support and still buy Lena Dunham's book where she admits to MOLESTING HER LITTLE SISTER. Except it's not considered molestation because the Social Justice Warriors are in charge of setting the context. Instead of Lena Dunham the CHILD MOLESTER touching her sister's vagina, it's warped into a fun childhood game of innocent curiosity. Again, it all depends on the gatekeeper's interpretation of events.  Our goal should be to stand against censorship, not give it an excuse to GROW.  But wait there's more!  Why is this girl allowed to create child porn for YouTube  To help voat in answering the legal question, according to the fucktard keyboard warriors on here, this girl is a child porn producer and YOUTUBE is her distribution center.  Conclusion: BAN YOUTUBE.  CASE CLOSED.   That sure is a lot of words just to say ""I'm a pedophile""."

According to anarcho-primitivism, the shift from hunter-gatherer to agricultural subsistence gave rise to social stratification, coercion, alienation, and population growth. Anarcho-primitivists advocate a return to non-""civilized"" ways of life through deindustrialization, abolition of the division of labor or specialization, and abandonment of large-scale organization technologies.  Many traditional anarchists reject the critique of civilization while some, such as Wolfi Landstreicher, endorse the critique but do not consider themselves anarcho-primitivists. Anarcho-primitivists are often distinguished by their focus on the praxis of achieving a feral state of being through ""rewilding"".

PanicHistory,3aquz4,thefx37,10,Tue Jun 23 00:32:00 2015 UTC,"I think you can absolutely make a case for diminishing privacy in developed nations, after all, the amount of information available on any one individual at any given time has grown at a completely unprecedented rate. We are frequently entering into contracts with various services (Facebook, google, reddit) in which we give up lots of information and then the explicit permission to these companies to use that information as they see fit (legally, of course)  Now I really don't think that means we're going to enter into a dystopia where police break down your door for accidentally pirating that TV show cause the site you streamed it from didn't have a valid license to do so... After all, we see that now that even private entities practice discretion. Your ISP is well aware of all the things you pirate, and they share that information with the parties who are being pirated from.   It is exceedingly unusual for any actual legal action to be taken of course. You have to be a particularly big offender, or sometimes it's just cause you downloaded that new movie that just got into the box offices and some studios can be pretty quick with a C&D order.  But privacy as we know it really is ""dying."" It's just way too easy to share information now, and people do so unaware of the consequences. Hell, a savvy thief can probably get all kinds of personal information on you if you're not careful, and they often do. No need to go rifling through garbage cans.   Course, most people's concerns are with government data collection. At least they are on reddit. Personally I'm much more concerned with what private unaccountable agencies might do with it, but it's not a big concern for me personally.   Really, it's just gonna be harder to commit crimes. This is both good and bad, depending on how we start to treat misdemeanors or relatively minor offenses."

Sure, Earth is in a terrible state, and humans aren't living in the healthiest of styles, but let's look at it like this there's probably no starvation, war, cultural or religious disagreements, and everyone seems to be happy, and at peace. Sure, we only saw one ship out of, I wanna say 3, but it's still great.  And even then, SPOILER ALERT they triumph over the bad guy, and land back on Earth, and start anew. Not sure if its canon, but the ending credits had them in different styles of art from different civilizations from different centuries, so many they advanced even more.  WALLE isn't exactly a terrible distopia. But at least they didn't use 1984, or Brave New World, or Ferinheight 451 this time."

PanicHistory,3ae393,reeblebeeble,9,Fri Jun 19 15:17:42 2015 UTC,It's a thing across many developed countries. Developed nations birth rates are very low (to the point of not being at a replacement level). The reason why the population continues to grow (across swathes of Europe for example) is due to migration.
PanicHistory,3ae393,isometimesweartweed,4,Fri Jun 19 16:09:51 2015 UTC,"The UK's birth rate is below replacement levels, along with almost every rich country."
PanicHistory,3ae393,Rekksu,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:18:08 2015 UTC,"This Wiki page is a good starting point.  The higher the average income of a country, the longer people live and the fewer children they have. In developed countries, the replacement rate - the birth rate required to keep the population stable - is about 2.1 children per adult couple. Once fertility drops below that the population will continue to grow for a time due to people living longer, but eventually will decline.  A second effect of this demographic transition is that the average citizen grows older. People live longer past retirement, and there are fewer young people entering the workforce. This is where it's nice to have immigrants to come in and work and pay taxes."

Issues that men face are largely due to institutionalized misogyny though, and that's what kills me.  They think that feminism is evil and about making women more powerful than men.  But the fact of the matter is, that if you think men are oppressed/more oppressed than women, it's because the rules were set up by misogynist assholes.  Statistics of women gaining custody more often even when undeserved?  Because courts see women as naturally better caretakers, even when it's entirely not true ESPECIALLY in certain situations.  Although to be fair, those stats aren't exactly taking everything else into context either, like a lot of men not even trying to get custody in the first place.  Mandatory to submit selective service form at 18 as a man but not a woman?  Nearly the same reasoning.  Women aren't as capable in the military in the eyes of many people and politicians.  They need to stay home with children.  Men aren't taken as seriously when they say they are raped by a woman?  Aside from the fact that most women aren't either (not to mention the culture around it being the woman's fault), other men set the precedent that rape was forceful penetration.  It's only been changed recently.  The culture of men enjoying it regardless and being too strong to be raped has been spread around in popular culture for ages, with many men agreeing with that idea, that it's been ingrained.  It still comes back to women being too weak to rape, or not naturally sexual beings to want to rape a man in the first place.  Men certainly have issues to deal with, yeah.  But it largely stems from the same issues that feminists are fighting against.  But no, they can't be feminists, because it has the root fem in it, it's only for women.  They need their own thing, and they need to completely ignore the cause, they just want to fix the surface issues.  Rant over.  Patriarchy is bad for everyone involved except the most privileged of men, and even then they could easily be fucked over by it at some point.  Edit: Worth pointing out that I'm (sorta) a dude, I guess.  So I'd be drafted too.  Although I'd immediately be dismissed due to the whole severe mental illness thing, but I mean, so would a lot of the people being drafted nowadays just due to lack of physical ability."

Just like every black man doesn't have his rights infringed or every cop isn't a criminal, every white male in America doesn't have it on easy street.    Think about your peers.  How many of them would admit to being molested as a kid?  Raped at a party?  How many would even believe him if he said it?  From mental health issues to sexual issues to just plain old expressing yourself openly and without adapting your less stereotypical parts so you look more like John Wayne.    Look through past Ask Reddit threads that all have samey ""Guys, what girly thing do you like but don't admit?"".  It's all the same shit.  Oh I love the smell of my girlfriends shampoo or I love to cook for my family!    Mens rights, the concept not the subreddit that shares more with hate groups than support groups, isn't the same as feminism and womens rights.  It's easy to look at it and say well if it's for men it must be feminism for the other gender.  But it's not.  There aren't laws or oppression.  Mens issues come from within.  We're scared to be who we are for fear of others thinking we're not who we were told to be like.    Mens rights is saying it's okay that you didn't end up like a hero in an action movie.  Fucked up shit happened.  It's okay to talk about it.    You are not any worse of a person because you got a divorce and a bad father to boot.

It's angry lazy college aged libertarians who don't get laid and thus think women should be property so that they can get laid.  Oh and on the cooking thing, move to NOLA!  Related story: my father built grocery stores for a living, and when a new grocery store chain moved into NOLA they always argued that their market studies were wrong, and people couldn't spend that much on food.  But the explanation was simple, in NOLA men cook.  And men are not frugal shoppers.  When a budget conscious housewife sees three different kinds of rice on the shelf, she buys the cheapest one.  When men see the same thing, they buy the most expensive one because they argue ""if it costs more it must be better"" and men don't cook for necessity or sense of duty as housewives do, they cook to one-up their male friends who also cook.  The end result is the average household in middle class and up south Louisiana spends twice as much on food as the same household in any other random place, because men shop for groceries there."

Let's say you take a list of random numbers between 0 and 9. The list can be any length you want. Sum them together. Let's say that their sum is 657.  What are the chances that the next number out of the random generator is a 9, giving you 666? It's 10%.  Let's say the sum is 658. What are the chances that the next number would be an 8? Again, 10%. This 10% probability would hold true for all cases between 1 and 9. (The zero case means you already were at 666.)  So the probability of an arbitrary number of digits of Pi summing to 666 is 10%. Hardly outside the realm of coincidence.  If they didn't add up to Pi, I'm sure the numerologists would instead say something like ""digits 5 through 150 add up to 666"". That is, using a sliding window over Pi until they get the answer they want. The chances of some window being found over an infinite series are infinitesimally close to 100%.

The blast was the deadliest Shining Path bombing during the Internal conflict in Peru  and was part of a larger bombing campaign in the city.  The explosions happened on Tarata Street, the business area of Miraflores Ward, an upscale district of the city. Two trucks, each packed with 1,000 kg of explosives, exploded on the street at 9:15 pm, killing 25 and wounding up to 200.  The blast destroyed or damaged 183 homes, 400 businesses and 63 parked cars.  The bombings were the beginning of a week-long Shining Path strike against the Peruvian government, a strike which caused 40 deaths and shut down much of the capital.   In the wake of the incident, galvanized by public outrage, President Alberto Fujimori intensified his crackdown on Peruvian insurgent groups.

PanicHistory,39ca0a,HeavyMetalStallion,-63,Wed Jun 10 23:49:20 2015 UTC,"There's nothing to respect about unhealthy levels of fat created by gluttony and buying excessive amounts of food and lack of exercise. It's unhealthy and it cause harm to others around them much like drug-use and alcoholism causes harm to family members. They are food addicts and trying to get others to accept their way of life when it is an unhealthy and abnormal way of life. They try to get others to make fat seem ""normal"".  We're not talking about people who can't change something about themselves. We're talking about people who are too lazy, too habitual, or too addicted to food/sugar to change their ways.   I'm sure you wouldn't say something like /r/junkiehate must be banned and their free speech suppressed. So why would you say that about fph? I'm sure you wouldn't say /r/antitheism should be banned despite being completely against certain ideas that people hold dear. You are allowed to hate, disagree, dislike people for their ideas and lifestyles. That's just how free society works. Modern society doesn't agree with hating people for things they cannot change (skin color, sexual orientation, class, gender). It's perfectly fine to hate people for things they can absolutely change, that they admit is bad, but are unwilling to make the sacrifices to change.  Plenty of people have changed their ways after having someone give them a dose of cold hard truth: that their lifestyle is unhealthy, horrific, and damaging to people around them. A ton of subscribers to FPH were in fact, doctors, surgeons, nutritionists, health professionals. A ton of subscribers were former-obese and former-overweight. They will all tell you, that if no one had shamed and mocked them into making drastic changes in their lifestyle, they would be dead or diabetic.  Certainly reddit's banning is not about stopping hatred or discrimination. We all know cops, government officials, soldiers, wallstreet bankers, congressmen, lobbyists, insurance workers, get some of the most hate on reddit. None of those subreddits are banned. No one has a problem with hating someone who has a career in a field that they would have incredible difficulty changing (they've done it their whole lives). So hating someone who has an eating problem, which is rather easy to solve (just don't eat so much, it's literally science), is not worse."

Do you honestly think people wouldn't be outraged by another sub attacking people with addictions? We would absolutely hate that too. And if Anthitheism crosses a line into attacking and harassing religious people, then yes I would say it should be banned. Because I have this crazy idea that we should treat other people like, you know, PEOPLE. It's not difficult. It's way easier than hating as hard as you hate.

FPH wasn't banned because of it's content. It was banned because of it's regular and significant brigading, to different subreddits, and sites."
PanicHistory,39ca0a,Ut_Prosim,16,Thu Jun 11 08:48:28 2015 UTC,"Shaming doesn't work as well as other methods in motivating people to lose weight.    This is not just a hunch, this has been clearly demonstrated and documented in peer-reviewed publications. One of the more well known experts on the effects of ""fat shaming"" is Dr. Sarah Jackson, an epidemiologist at University College London. For those truly curious, no, she is not obese herself.    She has three or four papers related to the phenomenon, the two most significant are here:     Jackson, Sarah E., Rebecca J. Beeken, and Jane Wardle. ""Perceived weight discrimination and changes in weight, waist circumference, and weight status."" Obesity 22.12 (2014): 2485-2488. PDF Finds clear association between shaming and weight gain.   Jackson, Sarah E., Rebecca J. Beeken, and Jane Wardle. ""Obesity, perceived weight discrimination, and psychological well‐being in older adults in England."" Obesity 23.5 (2015): 1105-1111. PDF Explores causation, shaming accounts for ~40% of psychological distress associated with weight gain.     She is far from the only researcher finding such results, here are another few relevant papers:      Friedman, Kelli E., Jamile A. Ashmore, and Katherine L. Applegate. ""Recent Experiences of Weight‐based Stigmatization in a Weight Loss Surgery Population: Psychological and Behavioral Correlates."" Obesity 16.S2 (2008): S69-S74. PDF Shaming leads to depression, emotional eating, and is associated with binge eating disorder.   Durso, Laura E., Janet D. Latner, and Kentaro Hayashi. ""Perceived discrimination is associated with binge eating in a community sample of non-overweight, overweight, and obese adults."" Obesity facts 5.6 (2012): 869-880. PDF As above, weight discrimination and shaming --> binge eating disorder.   Puhl, Rebecca M., and Kelly D. Brownell. ""Confronting and coping with weight stigma: an investigation of overweight and obese adults."" Obesity 14.10 (2006): 1802-1815. PDF Shaming positively associated with over-eating, fat-pride and acceptance, and refusal to diet; no statistically significant association with dieting. Vartanian, Lenny R., and Jacqueline G. Shaprow. ""Effects of weight stigma on exercise motivation and behavior a preliminary investigation among college-aged females."" Journal of Health Psychology 13.1 (2008): 131-138. Paywall Fat shaming leads to marked decrease in exercise.   So fat-shaming leads to depression, binge-eating, refusal to diet, refusal to exercise, and even fat-pride and acceptance, but has no association with dieting itself. Also people who were ""fat shamed"" while trying to lose weight lost less weight than those who weren't and were more likely to give up. It is fair to conclude that FPH was not doing a service to obese people, it was actually hurting them. From a public health standpoint, positive encouragement and setting a good example is far more helpful.      TL;DR: Guy above me is right."
PanicHistory,39ca0a,MRB2012,6,Thu Jun 11 10:45:10 2015 UTC,I'm sure you wouldn't say something like /r/junkiehate must be banned and their free speech suppressed   Free speech means nothing in a private space such as reddit.
PanicHistory,39ca0a,sydtron,11,Thu Jun 11 16:21:52 2015 UTC,"So if free speech is using other people's resources for your opinion, can I come over to your house and put up a billboard on your lawn with my opinions on it?   A ton of subscribers were former-obese and former-overweight. They will all tell you, that if no one had shamed and mocked them into making drastic changes in their lifestyle, they would be dead or diabetic.   Yeah, and they were all in a sub dedicated to human beings. That's kind of fucked up  ¯_(ツ)_/¯ The whole thing was basically a circlejerk for people with mental health/body image issues that wanted reinforcement for their body type, which shockingly isn't always healthy.    Certainly reddit's banning is not about stopping hatred or discrimination. We all know cops, government officials, soldiers, wallstreet bankers, congressmen, lobbyists, insurance workers, get some of the most hate on reddit. None of those subreddits are banned.   You know what the difference is? FPH's circlejerk was detrimental to their business. Coontown and any number of other hate subs will remain because they keep a lower profile and don't turn into a bunch of fanatics over it. So, congratulations, former FPH'ers you're worse for a social media site than actual Illinois Nazis."

What sucks is, it takes a ton of effort to hate as much as people like you do. And it's far uglier and more disgusting than anyone simply being overweight. The amount of effort it takes to get very obese pales in comparison to the effort it must take to keep up your level of utter disdain for your fellow humans."
PanicHistory,39ca0a,Biffingston,3,Thu Jun 11 08:35:28 2015 UTC,Because then they'd have to admit they lead pathetic lives and are assholes to strangers because it's better than admitting they're assholes and generally unpleasant people.

When we are using the word ""harass"", we're not talking about ""being annoying"" or vote manipulation or anything. We're talking about men and women whose lives are being affected and worry for their safety every day, because people from a certain community on reddit have decided to actually threaten them, online and off, every day. When you've had to talk to as many victims of it as we have, you'd understand that a brigade from one subreddit to another is miles away from the harassment we don't want being generated on our site.   A few isolated doxxings won't get a subreddit banned, even the horrible racist ones. Hell, I'd bet the mods of those places are extra vigilant to not give the admins an opening after this."

The best thing about reddit is that often times you find yourself discussing things with people who hold a wildly different point of view from you. Sometimes this leads to good discussions (although most of the time it ends up with people saying things like ""rape and slavery aren't all that bad"" which makes me vomit in my mouth a little).  Like I remember an AskReddit about when girls first noticed they were ""sexual beings"" - clearly meant to be a funny/naughty subject - but ended up being a great discussion about how most girls are somewhere between 8-14 and getting noticed by men 3, 4, 5, or more times their age. That was a great discussion that hopefully helped explain to men why leering and catcalling etc can be really scary to women.

PanicHistory,39ban9,askinnydude,20,Wed Jun 10 22:22:56 2015 UTC,"Naw, treason would be an extremely tough one, Cramer v. United States, 325 US 1 (1945) makes clear the standard for ""levying war"" against the US and ""adher[ing] to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort"" are both very high.  He's an open and shut case for a lot of crimes, but treason isn't one of them."
PanicHistory,39ban9,repeal16usc542a,7,Wed Jun 10 17:41:51 2015 UTC,"Disagree. It may not be open and shut, but certainly a treason case can (and will) be made. Aid to enemies isn't that high. There are nearly a dozen cases of people tried or convicted of treason for participating in German and Japanese radio propaganda broadcasts. That's pretty low effort aid.  The argument by the government would be that Snowden provided classified information regarding foreign operations to a foreign national. Snowden's argument will be that these foreign nationals weren't ""enemies"". But, considering information about operations in the middle east did end up public  and in the hands of enemies there I think there's a good chance he could be convicted.  Granted, finding a jury that hasn't been tainted will be nearly impossible."
PanicHistory,39ban9,StalinsLastStand,4,Wed Jun 10 20:48:10 2015 UTC,"But that's not sufficient.  From the case I cited:   Thus the crime of treason consists of two elements: adherence to the enemy; and rendering him aid and comfort. A citizen intellectually or emotionally may favor the enemy and harbor sympathies or convictions disloyal to this country's policy or interest, but so long as he commits no act of aid and comfort to the enemy, there is no treason. On the other hand, a citizen may take actions which do aid and comfort the enemy — making a speech critical of the government or opposing its measures, profiteering, striking in defense plants or essential work, and the hundred other things which impair our cohesion and diminish our strength — but if there is no adherence to the enemy in this, if there is no intent to betray, there is no treason.   I'm guessing the radio transmissions you are talking about were from US v. Burgman.  There, a US citizen made records for radio transmission, at the direction of an enemy we were at war with, with the express purpose of harming the morale of US service-members.  Both act and intent were clear.  With Snowden, while his act certainly did aid and comfort the enemy, when it comes to intent, I don't think you'll get there.  It's possible, no question, but it doesn't seem very likely.  You'd need testimony of two people to the overt act that demonstrated such intent, and just doing things that hurt the United States isn't enough."

PanicHistory,39ban9,StalinsLastStand,3,Thu Jun 11 04:46:10 2015 UTC,"Cyberwarfare operations were revealed to China. China is a cyber enemy that conducts cyberwarfare against the US. Edward Snowden gave information to China about that. That's treason. Aiding and abetting the enemy.   In addition to that, many terrorists in the middle east changed their tactics when Snowden revealed a lot of information. That is more than enough to convict. Snowden had global impact with his revelations and they did harm the US and aid the enemy. That's a fact.  Again, it might be hard to get a jury to convict on treason, but it is treason even if the standards are high."
PanicHistory,39ban9,HeavyMetalStallion,2,Thu Jun 11 05:46:20 2015 UTC,"You're just repeating the comment I replied to.  Again, as I state explicitly, I don't think the problem is with the aid and comfort portion of the analysis, it's with the adherence portion.  That's what Cramer is all about.  You're showing all of these reason why his actions aided and comforted enemies, but that just argues a point I already agreed with."
PanicHistory,39ban9,repeal16usc542a,6,Thu Jun 11 13:48:52 2015 UTC,"Those conspiracy theorists confuse me.
