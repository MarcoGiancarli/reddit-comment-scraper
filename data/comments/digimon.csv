digimon,3dz4h2,Sammy-Rose,13,Mon Jul 20 18:31:49 2015 UTC,"I'm going to rank Adventure>Tamer>Adventure 02.  The reason why I rank Adventure over Tamer is mainly because I like the lore better. However, story and character, I feel Tamer is superior."
digimon,3dz4h2,MasterInterface,3,Mon Jul 20 20:15:15 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. Although tamers had the darker and mature tone to it that I very much enjoyed, Adventure had such good world building in my opinion.  edit: spelling"
digimon,3dz4h2,xeqtioner0,5,Tue Jul 21 01:00:01 2015 UTC,"Adventure does have too many major characters, but it handles them better than most shows. There was this really dumb anime that had like, 15-25 characters, and to get around this they had them turn into stuffed dolls. It was pretty dumb. Thinking about it, Pokemon kinda does this too, by having the pokemon be in pokeballs. The digimon characters in adventure weren't that fleshed out, but at least they didn't have to come up with a dumb excuse like that.  My favorite season was probably Tamers, then Adventure. Tamer's story was better and the characters and world more fleshed out. I always liked Takato as the best of the goggled leaders, because he was like me, a sort of shy imaginative kid who thought of others a lot.  But Adventure probably influenced me more. I create characters and stories a lot and hope to do that as a career someday, and Adventure was one of my first introductions into continuous storytelling. Most shows for kids are episodic. That means Adventure also introduced me into the idea of character growth, and the idea of crests was like character traits."
digimon,3dz4h2,Wyietsayon,5,Mon Jul 20 19:26:59 2015 UTC,Tamers hands down. The kids were more involved with their Digimon. The Digimon could be destroyed and not come back. The kids had real life issues to deal with like Jeri's moms death. To top it off Bio Merging.
digimon,3dz4h2,CaptainMarker,3,Mon Jul 20 21:32:05 2015 UTC,Tamers is definitely the best
digimon,3dz4h2,Whatisjuicelol,5,Tue Jul 21 02:38:48 2015 UTC,"02 is obviously worse than Adventures and Tamers.   However, as for Adventures vs Tamers, I simply can't bring myself to decide which one is better so I settled myself for a compromis: neither of both it. They're both great shows with certain strenghts and weaknesses that make a 1 dimensional rating like ""X > Y"" unfair for both.  So, why do I like Adventures? Adventures tries to communicate values of which at least a few are relevant for each person on earth. But it not only tells you ""you need X"", but it shows you a character struggles with X and how he handles and overcomes this situation. This not only makes them grow as a character, but makes the viewer more attached to him as they ultimatly see a part of themselfs in them - or part of what they want to become eventually. But there is more to it than just values. The show also happens to talk about ""everyday"" problems a child in the target audience might have. And while some of these are quite special (e.g. being adopted or having divorced parents) I strongly assume that those, who can associate with these problems, felt a way stronger connection to these characters and the show due to this.    Another thing that is great about this show is the way the story is told. They use quite a lot of symbolism and hidden self references that, if you can spot them, make many emotional scenes even more emotional. Especially Takeru and Patamon are strong with this one: In Episode 8, Patamon is facinated by the picure of an angel in the Mansion, in Episode 12 Takeru and Patamon visit the Town of Beginning, introducing them - and the viewer - into the mechanics of Digimon Eggs which ultimatly ends with both promising each other that they'll always stay together and Patamon deciding that he doesn't want to evolve (because he fears that he can't be together with Takeru anymore then), blended out by a single feather in the wind. Finally, in Episode 13, Patamon then evolves to Angemon in order to protect Takeru and to defeat Devimon. But he gives his own life for this - breaking the promise he gave to Takeru - and only leaves behind a pile of feathers that fall to the ground and form a new Egg.    In my eyes thats one example for the awesome writing of Adventures. And adding the awesome music and the artstyle to the formula, Adventures managed to create a piece of art that I was able to appreciate as kid and that I'm able to appreciate as adult. I'd classify Adventures as ""beautiful"" as, for me, the core engagement of this show is the connection I feel to the characters and the world.  So, why do I like Tamer? Tamers does a very good job in building the relationship between Tamer and Digimon Partner in the first few Episodes (especially between Takatomon and Guilmon) and even more in portraying a more realistic view on how Digimon in the Human World would play out.   Using less main characters really paid out well for Tamers, as it allowed to give all Characters, and the Digimon, more background and character. Also, the focus on Takato - as opposed to the unfocused telling of the story in Adventures and 02 - was a very good decision, especially for the last arc.  But the moment Tamers really goes to awesome mode is the moment when Leomon dies. In this scene you can see 2 character getting psychically annihilated in 2 completly different ways: the one with rage that wants to destroy everything, and the other with despair that wants everything to stop. From this point on the show operates on an extremly high emotional and dramatic level and continues so until the end. (Not that it was bad before that, it just gets better)  All in all, Tamers is a pretty dark piece of art and that is exactly what makes it so great. The characters simply feel human with all their strenghts and weaknesses. I'd classify Tamers ""dramatic"" as, for me, the core engagement is the development of the characters under the extreme conditions they occur during the story. Let's not forget that Tamers is talking about depressions and PTSD!  Also, explained why Tamers is awesome in 90 seconds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJLZGoSzVa0    I could write a few hours more, why both seasons are awesome, but I hope you got my point.  PS: Everyone who writes here and only knows the US dub... watch the sub, otherwise you're not able to compare the seasons at all."
digimon,3dz4h2,SydMontague,0,Mon Jul 20 23:56:48 2015 UTC,Very good in-depth comparison!
digimon,3dz4h2,hoilori,2,Tue Jul 21 15:56:24 2015 UTC,"Adventure. I think it has the best balance and 'setup' or as someone else put it 'lore'.   I really loved Tamers, until Jeri's derpness. That annoyed me, too much irrational angst. That and the fact that the non-essential Tamers were treated as afterthoughts. There was really no real reason for anyone else to get Digimon other than to say, ""Yeah everyone has one now, so let's do nothing with them."" They were minor to the plot [obviously excluding Leomon]. You could have easily had the same story without the rest of the kids having Digimon.  02 is a massive disappointment, worst Digimon series/season in my opinion. Had they gone somewhere with Daemon and the Dark Ocean then it might have been redeemable, but the new kids and their ""I don't want to hurt the evil digimon trying to kill me and destroy the world"" nonsense was too much."
digimon,3dz4h2,Elvick,2,Tue Jul 21 06:16:20 2015 UTC,"This is surprising, when I ask my friends which one they would prefer, the usual answer would always be Adventures or 02. Nobody really liked Tamers.   But Tamers wins it for me. Love how it was realistic, dark and plot-wise awesome. Adventures is a close second. Partly for the nostalgic nature of it and also how it really worked out as something that can hook a new watcher. Adventures was the first anime I've ever watched and it still is close to my heart till now."
digimon,3dz4h2,chuck6726,3,Tue Jul 21 08:28:08 2015 UTC,"I like tamers the most.  Each time I listen to the music (German or Japanese, not English dub) I get the chills. The characters are extremely well developed and very reliable. I also like the extra approach to reality. Real World interaction with Digimon was always the most interesting about Digimon and what put the franchise on the map. Tamers is what 02 could've been if it was handled better. Adventure unfortunately didn't aged well imho."
digimon,3dz4h2,TheGamer821,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:53:48 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, what do you mean by ""didn't aged well""? I personally can't imagine too many things under this term (at least none I would strongly associate with Adventures), so I'd be glad if someone could explain that to me. :)"
digimon,3dz4h2,SydMontague,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:19:48 2015 UTC,"It usually mean that Quality drops over time badly. There are seasons, like Tamers for example, that you could watch nowadays without any nostalgia and still like it. Adventure doesn't have that. If you don't have nostalgic memories about the show then you'll pretty much wont like it. Before Digimon had it's 15th Anniversary celebration. Digimon Adventure was re-aired but the viewquotes were so low they took it down from television. Digimon Adventure was designed to appeal to people 16 years ago and there is nothing wrong with that. But unfortunately trends change, Quality standards improve and expectations are higher.   Which is why I'd prefer if Toei would make a Adventure remake sometime soon. They seem to use some really sweet animation quality of Tri. Imagine the original Adventure with that and a redone story to have less plot holes and more umpf to it. I would fanboy all over that."
digimon,3dz4h2,TheGamer821,3,Wed Jul 22 00:59:21 2015 UTC,"Tamers. 02 is decent and Adventure aged badly, its still good, but not as good as it used to be.  Tamers was just perfect. There is nothing I can point my finger on and say ""that was bad.""  02 had multiple of these situations and Adventure is just a pain to re-watch (after watching Tamers) for me personally and I have a really hard time trying to explain why."
digimon,3dz4h2,theshenox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:33:29 2015 UTC,"Tamer because of how well the story was thought out, but 01 comes close. 02 on the other hand..."

digimon,3dtsyy,lemontoast_,8,Sun Jul 19 13:30:20 2015 UTC,"plus they would have been like 5 or 10 years older them the original 8   Not really, the Digital World and the human world only moved at the same  ""time speed"" when the Dark Masters took control. Before that the Digital World moved much faster than the human world. So basically the original Chosen Children should be the same age as Taichi and co, except their adventure took place at the end of July.  Anyway I don' t think we're supposed to take the silhouettes literally as they're clearly Taichi, Takeru, Sora, Kouchirou and Yamato with their respective partner."
digimon,3dtsyy,zsmg,2,Sun Jul 19 15:03:59 2015 UTC,The dialogue in that scene indicates more that they were successfull. At least there is no hint that they failed...
digimon,3dtsyy,SydMontague,2,Sun Jul 19 14:02:38 2015 UTC,"Didn't they successfully seal the evil away? They only failed once the evil escaped and the Sovereign had to summon Tai and the others to the Digital World, right?"
digimon,3dtsyy,AhTreyYou,2,Sun Jul 19 16:02:40 2015 UTC,"The ones who called Taichi and the others were the bodyless entities of light, not the 4 sovereigns.   By the way the digital world operates in Adventures it can be assumed that even when the chosen Children win, their victory isn't of permanent nature as wherever there is light, naturally there will also be darkness. Darkness and light are like two sides of the same coin. And as the digital world is made up from computer data, corrupted data will influence the digital world all the time."
digimon,3dtsyy,SydMontague,2,Sun Jul 19 16:15:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe, failure could just mean they couldn't stop the big bad, doesn't mean they necessarily died, also I think she looks like she could be 5 years older than the original cast."
digimon,3dtsyy,artezzatrigger,3,Sun Jul 19 13:53:14 2015 UTC,I like this theory a lot. It would also bring a justification for why theres an Alphamon hanging around that wouldn't necessarily have to bring in Yggdrasil and the rest of the Royal Knights.
digimon,3dtsyy,artezzatrigger,3,Sun Jul 19 18:13:11 2015 UTC,How so? Am I missing something with how Alphamon connects with this theory?
digimon,3dtsyy,Yoshiji,2,Sun Jul 19 22:15:04 2015 UTC,"If the plot involves the original Digidestined, then the Alphamon could be a jogress between two of their partners, to parallel Omnimon thematically.  I mean, it did have the Ouryuken blade in the trailer, despite lacking the wings. Even if it wasn't necessarily a jogress, it could still be someones partner.   Maybe its just wishful thinking, since I feel like the Royal Knights as a whole have been in the spotlight a lot lately, and I'd rather keep Yggdrasil away from the Adventure series."
digimon,3dtsyy,SydMontague,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:56:39 2015 UTC,"Well they've been in a spotlight a lot but that's also because they somehow bring a key element to how the digital world is built with Yggdrasil, them, the X antibody etc...  I think that Alphamon wouldn't connect to this theory, just because he's supposed to be a carrier of the x-antibody, introduce the story of the royal knights, his only line known at this moment is dorumon's , and I don't think they will just forget how they built this digimon over the years with the movie, the different games etc.. in order to make him a ""normal"" digimon.  Omegamon has clear elements showing that he's a jogress ( cf his arms ), so it's not surprising at all. Alphamon on the other hand...   TL;DR: If we don't want to have a scenario based around the royal knights, the x antibody and Yggdrasil, I think that we have to forget about Alphamon, because it's been his sole purpose over the years."
digimon,3dtsyy,SydMontague,2,Mon Jul 20 15:44:43 2015 UTC,"I think the most important thing to notice about the previous chosen children is, that their existance is only subject of an inscribtion at the Ancient Dino Ruins. If we consider that these children had to defend the digital world against a different enemy than the Dark Masters and/or Apolcaymon it means their adventure must have happened before these enemies appeared or rather reached a position of power that endangers the digital world, otherwise it would've been their task to destroy them.  The events of Hikarigaoka and Odaiba are about 4 years apart. 1 second in the Human World within the 1st season of Adventure equals 1440 seconds in the Digital World, so about 6000 years have passed between these 2 events. Now, the earliest moment in the timeline where we see Piedmon in a position of power is, when he raids the facility where Gennai and his crew produced the Crests and Digivices for the 8. And while we don't know how far this event is away from the events at Hikarigaoka, we know that quite a while must've been passed to the 1st August 1999, as File Island was still covered in Ice back then.  So lets assume the writings in the ruins are indeed 5000-6000 years old (and it can be way older) and put that into relation to a human scale. 6000 years ago was around the time first human high cultures spawned and the written history starts. Now, having such old sources has several problems regarding their reliability that reach from translation errors over misinterpretations to simply wrong information. That mean not only that this source - which is not backed up by any secondary source - is not only pretty unreliable but also that, in case that it represents the truth, it must have happend at least 4 years before the Anime.  So in order to match the age shown in the image (it looks like she wears a school uniform, so I guess she is about 16-18) she must've been between 10-12 at the events of Odaiba and maximal 6-8 at her own adventure - which is possible, considering Takeru and Hikari being around that age during the Odaiba events. The image shown of the ""original 5"" can be easily seen as interpretation/imagination of the inscriptions, as the 5 characters are basically just outlines of Taichi, Takeru, Sora, Koushiro and Yamata and their Digimon partner.  But if we now add 02 to the formula it becomes pretty much impossible, that these children ever existed, otherwise they would've taken a role in 02. But screw 02. It is so full of problems and plot/logic/lore holes that it can't be considered canon for the first season anyways, as 02 quite often directly breaks the rules outlined within the first season.  So, generally it is possible that your theory works and it could indeed become interesting - but I doubt it personally."
digimon,3dtsyy,krfz41,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:39:36 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the detailed comment. You raise some good points, but how exactly does 02 make this theory impossible? I'm a bit rusty on the details as it has been a while since I last watched 02"
digimon,3dtsyy,stealthymangos,5,Sun Jul 19 22:17:41 2015 UTC,"In 02 basically everyone around the world gets to be a Chosen Child just because they once saw a Digimon (basically all humans did either after VenomVamdemon got defeated or during the events of ""Our War Game"").  However, that is contradictory to the lore around the Chosen Children in Adventures, who got a) chosen based upon personal traits and b) chosen to fulfill a specific task - saving the Digital World from the influence of Apocalymon. Based upon the inscriptions we also can be certain that at least b) is true for potential earlier Chosen Children - which is probably the reason they get called Chosen Children in the first place. :S  So that means the inscriptions can't be true, as 02 suggests that being a Chosen Child is not a matter of... well... being chosen.  Another point is, that Koushiro seems to be pretty well connected with the other Chosen Children around the world in 02. A group of people who already saved the Digital World once and reached a high level of bonding and power with their partners wouldn't play the role of unknowing civilists but act. And that either means they contact the protagonists or the protagonists notice them. Or to put it simple: if they existed, they should've left an influence on the Human or Digital World, that is noticable.  Besides that 02 contains many other problems and holes, like the explanation how the Digital World works (Season 1: virtual world made out of internet data | 02: parallel universe to the human world). Also, 02 uses the 4 souvereigns (Quinlongmon) as master of Gennai and the process of handing out Digivices, while the first season clearly states that this is the work of the bodyless entities of light, that possess Hikari in Episode 45 to explain the plot. And let's not forget the epilogue... or better let's forget the epilogue!  (I agree that my argumentation is anything but not a proof that it's actually completly impossible...)"

And especially in the Digimon Franchise this difference matters.

digimon,3drxby,Lobtical,5,Sat Jul 18 21:41:35 2015 UTC,"No, this never gets explained and the reason for that is quite simple: it can't be explained.  The digital world, as it gets depicted in Adventure, is made up out of data from the human computer network. To be more specific from unordered data, that means the data that builds up the digital world is actually something different, like a text file, an image file or even a reddit post. If you want an easy example of what I call ""unordered data"", try to open a .png file with a text editor.  However, being made up from data that exist in our computer network means that the digital world has a physical representation within the human world and therefore has to obey the laws of physics when interacting with the physical world.  Now we know that the human world depicted in Adventure is supposed to resemble to the world and the time (at least at original release*) we live in and that induces that the general laws of physics are the same or very close to each other in order to maintain the illusion.  All this leads to one conclusion: The way the digital world interacts with the physical world as shown in Digmon Adventure does not obey the laws of physics as we know them from our world and therefore can be declared as ""fantasy"". As the show was targeted at a younger audience - and generally built upon the ""fantastic"" (as in fascinating) - the authors probably didn't see the need explain these things. The viewers would either not care, not understand or, in the worst case, understand that it's nonsense (technobabble). Just accept it like it is, acknowledge that it isn't realistic and continue to enjoy the show. ;)  As for the narrative part of this thing... I'd say/assume that this post-VenomVamdemon physical world part serves mainly one purpose: The Call to Action for the Dark Master arc. By showing the Digital World - and the danger it represents to the physical world - the Chosen Children is shown that their task is not finished AND that it matters for their own lives/world. Otherwise they could've just stayed in the physical world and live along their lives (and actually even with their Digimon partners) ignoring the needs of the digital world. And while I doubt that the Chosen Children would refuse the call to Action at this point, the whole situation made it way easier for them to justify themselfs in front of their parents and family.  *Episode 21, where the exact date for the events got mentioned the first time (1st August 1999), aired on... the 1st of August 1999. ;)"

digimon,3drxby,TheGamer821,2,Sat Jul 18 23:04:35 2015 UTC,It probably is supposed to be failed Digitizing. Kuwagamon leaving the Digiworld is probably still in a very unstable state thus causing the same effect as trying to fly into the Digiworld.  Funny how we take Digimon simply being able to exist in the Human world for granted but when a plane fails to enter the Digiworld we get skeptical.

digimon,3dgz30,BlueDragonKaiser,5,Thu Jul 16 04:52:57 2015 UTC,"Wasn't Rumble more of a test to see how much Digimon games would sell outside Japan? I'd imagine the Japan-only games would have been better for that honestly. It's strange they didn't just translate one of those games, considering how much the fan base prefers the Vita ones."
digimon,3dgz30,bunnyblaster,2,Thu Jul 16 05:04:07 2015 UTC,"Rumble is on sale for $20 right now, but as far as I can tell it's just a dumb little 'fighter'. That's not what I think of when I think of a digimon game."
digimon,3dgz30,HypotheticalRicotta,2,Thu Jul 16 13:11:00 2015 UTC,"It's strange they didn't just translate one of those games,   It's because Bandai Namco are an incredibly risk-averse company. So unless the product is a slam-dunk, there is very little chance of it leaving Japan.   They also were INCREDIBLY bad at managing their properties outside of Japan, which had given them the false impression that we didn't like things like Digimon, Super Robot Wars, Gundam etc. Nowadays they are slowly starting to realize that there is a large market overseas, but even then its kind of luke warm.  At least they aren't SEGA."
digimon,3dgz30,Kiviar,5,Mon Jul 20 01:50:31 2015 UTC,"Saban actually had something to do with All-Star Rumble, that's probably why. They are even in the opening of the game. It was in part created to advertise Fusion [hence including Shoutmon/Dorulumon]. Meanwhile Cyber Sleuth doesn't have Fusion Digimon like Shoutmon or Dorulumon [much to my dismay, love them!]  This is also why it was announced for the west rather than a game made for Japan and then brought over.  Namco Bandai is the one that has something to do with Cyber Sleuth and they are talking about it a lot on their social media. Maybe Saban will talk about it more when it's closer, just because any success for Digimon is a net gain for them as well. But yeah, they [Saban] run all the Digimon franchise social media, and they don't talk about the MMO out there either. [not sure who makes that]  As for why Saban doesn't post much about Tamers, Frontier, Savers... I don't know. Especially since people generally love Tamers. Bamco doesn't do much with Frontier and Savers, or Fusion either. Which stinks, Frontier has some of my favorite Digimon."

digimon,3ddlwh,chaosakita,4,Wed Jul 15 15:06:16 2015 UTC,Heh. I have some of the doujin Mercy Rabbit worked on -- high quality fan artists actually seem to get brought in to do artwork officially more in Japan than we would expect. For example: Karabiner/Den also did some official art for at least a few of the X-Antibody Digimon in the older card game.

digimon,3ddlwh,Waltonruler5,7,Wed Jul 15 18:07:59 2015 UTC,"I'd say the one on the right is more fanservice. Arms are raised and chest is pointed out to emphasize the boobs. Flat stomach is also arched forward, even though it's farther and less area than on the left, it stuck out more. Hips are then emphasized by arching the back so much that she looks like she's doing her morning stretches (hawkeye initiative could have fun here). Only thing that is really more emphasized on the left is her bare thigh, not exactly a sexual focal point in photos."

From an economic standpoint you are ignoring potential millions by not getting into the mobile market successfully. Digimon has yet to be the sweet cash cow they desire. That being said I'll play this when it comes out if it doesn't require a Japanese mobile phone provider email address like some Monster Hunter mobile games.

digimon,3d9sri,Calhoun1389,3,Tue Jul 14 22:48:36 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the Japanese version had online battling so it should stay the same here. I bought a PS4 for Dragonball Xenoverse and Bamco then gives me Jstars and Cyber Sleuth. They've totally redeemed themselves to me

digimon,3d9sri,AhTreyYou,3,Wed Jul 15 05:24:02 2015 UTC,Agreed  I'm not going to lie I bought All-Star Rumble like two weeks before cyber sleuth was announced for the west so I feel like the whole reason we are getting dgimon games again outside of japan is because of me.
digimon,3dc75b,Megalokk,5,Wed Jul 15 03:17:56 2015 UTC,"Some tips:  each material digimon that you fuse with your main costs bits that scale with your main digi's level.  Therefore it is cost beneficial to wait until you have the 5 max material digimon before fusing.    At higher levels, if you can fuse one or two digis without causing your main to level up, do that and then when your next fuse will cause the main to level, you must fill all 5 material slots.  You also get bonus if all 5 material digimon are the same type (confirmed), and are the type as your main (confirmed). Also might be bonus xp if all 5 are the same (unconfirmed).  You get more XP for higher formed, higher level, and higher rarity material digimon.  One trick I do is to prelevel materials.  To do this you'll need to farm 30 digimon, preferably the same exact one.  Fuse one with 5 others 5 times so that you then have 5 digimon of lv 8-12 depending on the digimon. This will only cost you 2500 bits.  Then you can fuse those 5 into your main.  Note that the cost benefit of this is situational.  I usually will use rookies to prelevel rarer champs (or champs into ult)and then use that to fuse to the main.    Just keep playing.  At higher levels you will receive thousands of bits per game.  Good luck!"

digimon,3dcxz4,TheGamer821,2,Thu Jul 16 11:35:28 2015 UTC,In previous Digimon Story games your digimon could easily reach 9999 max stats so it didn't really matter if you go into a fight with a Koromon or War Greymon.  Now Each Digimon has a individual Stat cap and 1 to 2 signature attacks so choosing which Digimon to use in multiplayer and post story is much more important.

You can't honestly expect them to add new content without new bugs being introduced. Now, if we speak of old/ancient bugs still being in the game, then yeah - I agree. Those should've been fixed a long time ago. Also, the ""bugs"" you're talking about have been known  for a while. They're the reason why we haven't had a new Event. Their servers were fucked, might still be getting fucked, so they're holding off the updates until their shit's fixed.

digimon,3d8zww,enahsg,3,Wed Jul 15 01:08:28 2015 UTC,"Wait, people hated that they were gonna be movies?   Because on average the Digimon movies are pretty terrible, only the first two Digimon movies are good. Furthermore the Digimon movies are very short (around 40 minutes) because of the shortness they tend to have poor character focus. Which is to say most of the established cast tends to get ignored and usually it's the male lead + someone else that gets all the focus.  Furthermore, a 50 episodes TV series is completed in a single year while 7 movies could take a very long time see Evangelion re:build, Rose of Versailles has been in development hell for a long time etc.  So really you can't blame people for being disappointed."
digimon,3d8zww,DeRockProject,2,Thu Jul 16 08:07:33 2015 UTC,"Thing about movies is that it can't really convey anyone outside of the main cast well, and even the main cast gets old soon enough.  I mean, can you think of many films you watched a year ago and you can still remember a lot of the things that the characters did?  TV shows, on the other hand, do not have this limitation.  Sure, their budget has to be stretched much further than a movie, but with lower budget comes time, and with time comes the ability to flesh out not just Super Hero A, but also minor character R, and everyone in between those two in terms of importance.  It doesn't rush character development for plot, or plot for character development.  It gives you that time that you can form bonds with them.  You become invested in their goals (the plot).  You truly care about what happens, and are not just enjoying it for the sake of it being cool (which it still is).  Can you think of 1 movie that you saw at least a year ago, only once, that made you think like that (movies that are part of a series don't count)?  The upcoming movies have 2 saving graces in this sense.  1) The movie is a movie series (with 6 movies in it).  It won't be rushed like it would if it tried to congest something into one movie.  2) We already care about these characters.  They have been established before, and though their characters can (digi)volve (and they should), they don't need to hook us onto caring about them.  We already do."

digimon,3d258z,Kaioken0591,4,Sun Jul 12 23:20:21 2015 UTC,"I like how no one says a thing on the posts when a video is uploaded but when a discussion is made about it everyone jumps on it saying they agree. Anyway on with my input on this.   As one of the reddit users that frequently posts their content here I will start by apologizing for I guess the daily posts of updates from my channel since I just found out a few hours ago that you were only supposed to do so once a week.    Regarding ""clogging this subreddit with sub par let's plays and some guy wagging his dick around trying to make something of his YouTube channel causing people to leave"" If the purpose of posing the videos on youtube and here was to actually make something of our channels why would we post here where not too many people frequent? Why would we not play a game that would attract more people for that reason instead of playing a game that we enjoy and give those games more exposure and support? Yea it is self promotion for the content creator making the post but the main reason we(or at the very least I have been uploading to yt and posting here) is because not only do I enjoy making content but it can help people out who are struggling with a certain part in a game but like I said before it give the game more exposure so that more people may end up playing it and getting into whatever series it is. As for people leaving because they see a post of a yt video I highly doubt that is the reason especially since if someone needs some information on a game/help with a certain part they will more than likely look up a guide or search youtube on how to complete it.   Finally if you think the LPs are sub par at best why not leave feed back for the creator? Lets say all of the videos posted here are cut back but every once in a while you see the same sub par content for a game that you genuinely enjoy wouldn't that bother you? I always leave feed back for that reason especially since a lot of the games I enjoy watching/playing are much less popular than many others. Anyway what I said may have been slightly biased since I was the one posting frequently but again this is just my thought process on this whole situation and once again I apologize for not knowing/reading the rules regarding the posting of videos here."

Shit I actually put a lot of time and effort into) and recently reviewed RE:Digitize, but I didn't post it here because I didn't want to be seen as a shill.  Someone else ended up posting it, and I still felt pretty bad.  I've never done a Let's Play, and I never bloody will. The only reason I share the stuff I spend hundreds of hours on playing, analysing, and presenting, is because I think some people genuinely enjoy it.  All that said, I completely agree with this post, and I understand why people hate opportunistic shills who use subreddits to try to gain something close to e-fame.   A weekly shill thread isn't an awful idea, as it funnels out the people who don't want to be advertised to."
digimon,3d258z,Wyietsayon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:43:46 2015 UTC,"I'm ok with let's play videos being posted here. It reminds me that yeah, people are still interested in Digimon and are doing projects on them. There's not a ton of other posts of projects here. I'd love more fan art here too, especially from people who really take some time on it. And other projects, fan remixes and whatnot.  Also, more discussion would be great. Talk about the themes and messages in the show? Maybe some of the people who made it and what they're doing now?   What I get tired of is people posting their crests box set. Yeah, we can see you got them. Hooray. You can stop now. There's at least one of these posts every day. It's cool when you can help point others to cheap places to get it or when you include other things you got too, but if all your posting is a picture of the sealed box, then stop. I can go google that."
digimon,3d258z,pkmongoose,0,Mon Jul 13 16:31:01 2015 UTC,It's not the fact that people are posting LP's that is the problem. It's the fact that certain users upload their LPs every damn day that is.
digimon,3d258z,Wyietsayon,2,Tue Jul 14 02:30:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and I'm ok with that. I view it as art. Admittedly, it's annoying when it's art/videos/etc that someone hasn't put a lot of work into it, but still, art.   Also, this subreddit needs more activity. The let's plays wouldn't stand out as much if there were 10-15 more topics each day. But it's pretty slow, and we only seem to get 5 or less per day, with most of them being quick questions about the games. I want more thought provoking stuff, discussions, things that make me go, WOW. And the let's plays are the only consistent things that seem to be trying to do that."

Just keep it to at most one a week   Edit: Lol what's with the downvote brigade? What I said completely follows the rules as shown in the top post. I'm just against the idea of censoring content, if you don't like something then just ignore it. Is that really such an unpopular way to do things here? Why ruin it for those that do enjoy it?"

digimon,3d4b2j,Mr_OneHitWonder,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:07:29 2015 UTC,"Well polising these PSP Character models did take them a lot of time.  Crimson Mode wasn't in Re:Digitize and Digimon Adventure so they would have to make a new character model from scratch and the Cyber Sleuth Character are extremly detailed.  So far the PS4 port is just a regular port. If it's enhanced like Decode, which I doubt since we would have a teaser by now, we could expect more Digimon.  Hope is all we have atm."

digimon,3d2jyr,Pokelucelop,3,Mon Jul 13 00:45:57 2015 UTC,"You're either looking for ""Our War Game"", the 2nd Digimon movie which only got release in Japan. You should be able to find it on quite a few sites with subtitles by googling it.  Or you're looking for ""Digimon: The Movie"", the Movie produced by Fox Kids, that tries to tie the 2h of the first 3 japanese Digimon movies into a 1,5h movie - including a complete soundtrack change and massive dialogue changes. I think I've seen this one on Youtube in multiple languages."

Here's the cheapest seller on eBay; there are more sellers in the ""Similar Items"" section.  The book was $.25 at my local thrift shop. It has a coffee ring stain on the title page, but is in otherwise pristine condition. Looks to be available online for $7.29 here and $6 here.  The comforter was a Christmas present from over a decade ago, so I can't say the price or origin. Can't find it online either.

digimon,3d1b19,Quente,2,Mon Jul 13 22:58:20 2015 UTC,"I've already done a couple of the ones you listed, so I don't have much to contribute other than:  DemiDevimon (Purple) > Devimon (Purple) OR Devidramon (Purple)  Greymon (Red) > Metalgreymon (Red) OR Skullgreymon (Red)"
digimon,3d1b19,doom-bubble,2,Sun Jul 12 18:36:45 2015 UTC,Cyberdramon(Red) -> Justimon((Red)

digimon,3d1b19,14394,2,Mon Jul 13 08:53:37 2015 UTC,"I found a website that list the Digimon and digivolutions. It's in Japanese though, someone will need to translate them. I was planning to make a list but I'm currently unavailable at the moment. Sorry orz  http://digimoncrusader.wiki.fc2.com/m/menu/"
digimon,3d1b19,Calvinized,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:45:09 2015 UTC,"The website doesn't seem to have much though, everything on evolution I click on is ""No Page Found"" in red"
digimon,3d1b19,AlVinyl,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:35:45 2015 UTC,"Go to the モンスター図鑑 section, then you can pretty much make the evolution line from there :P"
digimon,3d1b19,Calvinized,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:41:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah but they don't have all the cards/lines and it's pretty much not in order. E.G the red one they laid out Gabumon, Monochromon and Renamon, however the two star cards they listed in Garurumon, Greymon and Kyubimon (Monochromin doesn't become Greymon though.) So far it seems like only the obvious ones are listed like Dorumon > Dorugamon >Dorugreymon"
digimon,3d1b19,AlVinyl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:43:19 2015 UTC,All I've managed to do so far is  Goburimon (Purple) > Centalmon (Red) OR Ogremon (Purple)  Monochromon (Red) > Mammon (Red)

digimon,3d0ze1,AhTreyYou,2,Sun Jul 12 16:48:26 2015 UTC,"You have to be hit with it, the more times you are hit with it in battle the better. I usually defend the move I am trying to learn about 4-5 time then I end up getting it with about 600+ brains so you should have no problem if you do the same"
digimon,3d0ze1,Kaioken0591,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:24:32 2015 UTC,But does Sukamon use that attack? I've been in about 8 10 minute battles with it and I never get it even with 999 brains.
digimon,3d0ze1,Kaioken0591,2,Sun Jul 12 17:42:07 2015 UTC,"That I am not sure about since I had my MetalEtemon before the sky fell but I for whatever reason it seems like the wild mons don't tend to  use the high level skills that often but that could just be me, I would try all the mons in the sewer though since even though in FAQs and stuff it lists certain mons to learn techs you can still get them from mons not listed like my MetalEtemon learned Heavy Impact from a Guardramon and not a Leomon or Tailmon like listed"
digimon,3d0ze1,SydMontague,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:50:01 2015 UTC,"Hmm... Thanks! I acquired the Plant, Dark/Light and Combat level 7 techs and I want to get this one before I move on to Fire and Machine. I'm kind of surprised they didn't put a wild MetalEtemon in Binary Castle, it would make getting this skill 100x easier"
digimon,3d0ze1,Ephraim225,2,Sun Jul 12 18:06:16 2015 UTC,The Sukamon at the memorial stellar in the sewers use this move.

digimon,3ctb7v,huthoor,10,Fri Jul 10 16:34:59 2015 UTC,At first I thought it was cute then I remembered that his fur was removable fits the aesthetic of this cosplay super well.
digimon,3ctb7v,Manjoume,3,Fri Jul 10 19:26:36 2015 UTC,"Wait, it's removable?!"
digimon,3ctb7v,Sneaks_exe,18,Fri Jul 10 21:45:09 2015 UTC,Sure is. He takes it off in Adventure to keep Matt warm once or twice.
digimon,3ctb7v,Donut90,12,Fri Jul 10 22:14:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, his body is actually reptilian, just with wearing a fur pelt, presumably the pelt from another of his evolved species. Gabumon = Cubone?  Meh, makes more sense than a cat turning into an angel."
digimon,3ctb7v,PetevonPete,7,Fri Jul 10 23:36:58 2015 UTC,Yeah I never undertstood how a reptile became a wolf. The transition from wolf to werewolf made more sense but then it went to mecha wolf.   Edit: I never made the Cubone connection. Think they actually went for that?
digimon,3ctb7v,Manjoume,7,Sat Jul 11 00:10:54 2015 UTC,Went for what? Digimon came before Pokemon
digimon,3ctb7v,SkjCzaero,0,Sat Jul 11 05:56:23 2015 UTC,Since when? Lmao Pokemon is 1995 Digimon is 1997.
digimon,3ctb7v,wynaut_23,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:40:37 2015 UTC,Wow fuck I'm dumb
digimon,3ctb7v,SkjCzaero,2,Sun Jul 12 02:10:22 2015 UTC,"From the Wiki. http://digimon.wikia.com/wiki/Gabumon#cite_note-3  Gabumon is a Reptile Digimon whose name and design are derived from the ""Gabu Kashira"" (がぶ頭?), a Kabuki puppet whose face instantly changes from that of a timid maiden to a horned fiend with the pull of a string. Although it is covered by a fur pelt, it is still clearly a Reptile Digimon. Due to its extremely timid and shy personality, it always gathers up the data which Garurumon leaves behind, and shapes it into a fur pelt to wear. Because it is wearing the fur pelt of Garurumon, who is feared by other Digimon, it fills the role of safeguarding itself as a result of protecting its body. When it is wearing the fur pelt, its personality does a complete 180° shift.[4]  So Gabumon is more like synergy-based evolution pokemon such as Slowpoke/Mantyke/Cubone where they require other pokemon or items to help them evolve."
digimon,3ctb7v,RamenRider,7,Sat Jul 11 11:06:34 2015 UTC,OMG! I love this! <3

digimon,3crouq,tsonny1104,3,Fri Jul 10 05:57:47 2015 UTC,"As the digimon get stronger and get access to stronger skills, they lose the ability to use the weaker ones. Just go out and find some higher-level machine and fire digimon and try to unlock some better skills."
digimon,3crouq,Myxozoa,2,Fri Jul 10 12:17:35 2015 UTC,so do the levels coincide with the digivolution level? like rookies can use lv1 champions can use lv2 and so on?
digimon,3crouq,Myxozoa,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:53:32 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. There's a primary, secondary, and tertiary skill type affiliation for each digimon, but not all digimon use all three slots. Digimon learn their most powerful skills from their primary affiliation, least powerful skills from their tertiary affiliation, and are usually somewhere in the middle for their secondary affiliation. Agumon, for example, is affiliated with fighting and fire, so it can learn those two skills, but it has no third affiliation, so it only has access to those two. It's only a rookie, so both type affiliations only have access to low-level skills. A mega, on the other hand, usually has access to 3 different type affiliations, but the difference between primary, secondary, and tertiary is more pronounced. My Marineangemon, for example, who has water, holy, and electric type affiliations, can learn really powerful water type skills, powerful holy skills, and less powerful electric skills."
digimon,3crouq,Kaioken0591,3,Fri Jul 10 13:52:41 2015 UTC,A lot of the time the skillset for a mon will change when it Digivolves you just need to get some Machine/Flame/Fighting skills that MetalGreymon can learn

Instead of asking for DBO we should ask about a new MMO that is actually fun to play (because DMO ain't really great) and focuses on all Animes and not just one and appeals to both DMO and DMO fans.."

digimon,3cni2m,lemontoast_,11,Thu Jul 9 07:32:57 2015 UTC,"Hate isn't the right word. What I do is criticice 02 and showing it's many errors, mistakes and problems.  02 contains a lot of plot holes Be it the abadoned Dagomon arc, the explanations how the digital world works (that are contrary to the explanations in the first season), the lax use of ""DigiDestined"" or simply the many things that are not properly explained. 02 simply contains too many of these plot problems. And let's not forget the ending/epilogue.  The setting of 02 is often quite boring By giving the children the ability to enter and leave the digital world whenever they wanted to removed the urgency of adventure from the show. It also opened the path for meaningless episodes, as an typical episode started with the children being in their world and ended with them being in their world, moving progression of the plot more to a meta level. And let's not forget the ending/epilogue.  The writing and characters for 02 are often quite bad A significant part of the group is forgetable - so forgetable that many people actually have problems to remember Cody's/Iori's and Jolei's/Miyako's names. How often do you see a (main) character cry in 02? Rarely and by far not equally distributed among the group. Now compare it to Adventures or Tamers and you'll see that every main characters cries at least once within the show. You may ask yourself why this is important, it is because of association and emphaty. Everyone of us had moments of weakness where we just wanted to cry, where we had to release the burden on our soul. Personally I can't feel connected to such characters. Needless to say that the characters that had these moments of weaknesses are by far better percieved and remembered (e.g. Ken and BlackWarGreymon, which are both awesome characters that don't have to hide themselfs compared to other seasons). Otherwise the writing of the show is meh at many parts, failing to create proper emotional, artistic and rememberable scenes and often ruining scenes because of stupid reasons (The fight of the WarGreymon's had the potential to be one of the best fights ever, but Imperialdramon had to join it, because you know... WarGreymon isn't a main character...). And let's not forget the ending/epilogue.  I simply think 02 is worse than Adventures and Tamers. That doesn mean I hate it - if I would I wouldn't have watched it like 4 times within the last year..."
digimon,3cni2m,SydMontague,3,Thu Jul 9 10:07:53 2015 UTC,"Also, character development is really rare. Ken and Blackwargreymon must be the only ones with it... The awful personalities of the 02 crew, Davis has the personality of a wood plank!"

It also opened the path for meaningless episodes, as an typical episode started with the children being in their world and ended with them being in their world, moving progression of the plot more to a meta level.   I didn't mind this element so much, to me it added a conflict of fighting the secrecy of the situation  while still trying to handle the Digital World at the same time. What would have been interesting is if the Adventure parents still had a fresh memory of what happened before and suddenly had to try to explain this to the 02 parents (even Ken's while he was in his Kaiser phase)."

digimon,3cni2m,SydMontague,2,Thu Jul 9 10:40:43 2015 UTC,"The word document would indeed make sense, however by writing these text anew every time it allows me to think about the topic again and to find new ideas, arguments and conclusions. ;)  Also, I probably should've mentioned that my view on the show is based upon the sub and the german dub. The US dub is a completly different show compared to these, even though many of my critique points are probably true for the US dub as well (and maybe even stronger)."
digimon,3cni2m,Cruelus_Rex,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:05:07 2015 UTC,While the rest of your points might be valid for all the versions of the anime I gotta say that in the spanish dub (which is the only one I have seen) the characters are quite likeable.

digimon,3ckx5o,lemontoast_,9,Wed Jul 8 20:31:24 2015 UTC,"This is just BS. You can still hear the emotion in the voice and the quality of the voice .

Or do you think someone needs to be 100% fluent in a language to enjoy movies and shows from other countries?"
digimon,3ckx5o,chaosakita,-9,Wed Jul 8 20:42:12 2015 UTC,i never said you needed to be 100% fluent to enjoy it but the point was how can say the voice acting is better when don't speak the langue and not trying to be raciest but all of the voices sound pretty much the same in Japanese dubbed anime but girl are higher pitch voices then boys
digimon,3ckx5o,SydMontague,0,Wed Jul 8 20:48:30 2015 UTC,Yeah my enjoying of the original Japanese and the Chinese versions was totally fake! Thanks for letting me know! Now I should just watch the American dub entirely. There's no way people could have different preferences.
digimon,3ckx5o,lemontoast_,-10,Wed Jul 8 20:50:33 2015 UTC,its like saying that  you prefer someone screaming in your face rather then someone speaking to you in a language you know
digimon,3ckx5o,alboreas,3,Wed Jul 8 20:56:32 2015 UTC,Oh yeah there's no way to distinguish someone screaming in my face versus talking to me normally. Probably because all Asian people look the same.
digimon,3ckx5o,lemontoast_,-6,Wed Jul 8 21:15:24 2015 UTC,it seems that you don't understand what i am trying to say and probably never will you need think out side the box and think what i am saying  and don't be racist that's not cool at all remember the Japanese are the people that gave us digimon in the first place so have some respect please
digimon,3ckx5o,Infintinity,2,Wed Jul 8 21:23:55 2015 UTC,Yup all Asian people look and sound the same! I'm not taking it back.
digimon,3ckx5o,chaosakita,4,Wed Jul 8 21:30:31 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m71HJZKdqzs - Someone linked me to that when I said I was worried about that issue you mentioned. I dunno, some people do say they get more out of something if it's in their home language and they don't have to read off the screen, others feel different.  I just felt that in the english version the voice acting was often very forced and cringe inducingly bad at times. In the japanese version it sounds natural, if someone is distressed, upset, angry, happy, whatever, you can actually hear it in their voice. (This comparison I would not apply to the other seasons however, I felt that the English dub of Tamers was very good and I have not seen any comparison with the other seasons).  Also, I watch subs a lot, for anime and for non-english language films (I'm very keen on film and am studying it and as such, have to watch a lot of films for research and as such, end up watching a lot of non-english language films. Also, in South Africa where I live, a lot of local film and television shows are in Afrikaans or one of our many national languages which I am not able to fluently speak and/or understand).  I think you can get used to watching subbed because at first I did find I was reading and focusing more on the writing than what was going on but after a while of watching subs when no dub was available I began to prefer them.  Except SAO season 2. No. Sies. I'm sorry but I felt the English voice actors where way better."
digimon,3ckx5o,SydMontague,3,Wed Jul 8 21:50:04 2015 UTC,"Actually, you can up to a certain degree.  Voice acting isn't the art of reading line after line - it is to fill these lines with character, emotion and context. And as it is acting, these things are not only transported through the text itself but also through the way the actors speak and, unlike the language itself, these things are actually quite universal throughout the human societies.  You can easily notice the difference between a sentence spoken in fear and one spoken in anger, even if you don't understand the language itself. Of course you can tell these differences even better when you actually know the language and it's quirks - which is actually something you start to learn once you consume content in other languages.  So, as you can understand what the characters says (through subtitles) and also percieve how the VA delivered his line (as this is mostly universal), you can compare the VA's performance. In the case of US dub vs original it's maybe a bit unfair due to the different dialogue, though..."
digimon,3ckx5o,-Sniper-Wolf-,-2,Wed Jul 8 21:35:38 2015 UTC,you are like so right plus my main point is without subtitle yeah u would get the emotions but you would  not understand what they are saying so how can u say something is better when you don't understand it to begin with
digimon,3ckx5o,chaosakita,2,Wed Jul 8 21:40:44 2015 UTC,You are completely wrong and misunderstanding syd's point. He was providing a complete counter to your initial argument. Dialogue differences have nothing to do with a va's abilities. That's like saying a great actor is bad because he got a role you didn't like. You don't need to be fluent in a language to understand emotion and delivery of a line.
digimon,3ckx5o,-Sniper-Wolf-,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:48:16 2015 UTC,i have never said anything about emotions

digimon,3ck5q5,crawphish,3,Wed Jul 8 15:24:43 2015 UTC,"There is a Skill Guide on GameFAQs as well. I don't know how reliable the learning formula, which gets presented in this guide, is, but it at least tell you where to get every move.  The 35+ techs are a bonus condition. Having them makes it easier to evolve, but it is not required.  However: You don't really need a guide to play most of Re:Digitize. The game does a lot better job at explaining and hinting it's systems than DW1. Most evolutions can be easily achieved without knowing the actual values by using logic and the hints the evolution chart gives you (to avoid evolutions you already had)."

digimon,3ck5q5,SydMontague,2,Wed Jul 8 16:53:50 2015 UTC,It's quite normal. You learn a lot of moves during the normal progress of the game. Training for moves isn't that usefull outside of the end game as you waste a lot of time you could use to raise other stats.
digimon,3ck5q5,Kaioken0591,2,Wed Jul 8 17:23:33 2015 UTC,"You should also have Fire Breath since you start with that move on Agumon, I would raise brains a bit and check the Skill Guide that Syd referred to so you can see what you can learn"

digimon,3cliq2,Megalokk,2,Wed Jul 8 21:04:23 2015 UTC,"Getting Numemon is suprisingly hard in Re:Digitize, under certain conditions even impossible.  To get strong, high level Digimon I'd recommend to spent the time in the low levels just by training. Battles usually take too much time for not enough effect. If you don't know/care what evolution you're aiming for, keep your stats balanced and high to make sure you enable at least one evolution, the stats requirements for Champions are usually between 80-120, for Ultimates (dub) between 200-300 and for Megas between 400-600. (in DW1 it's 100 for champions and usually ~500, with many exceptions, for ultimates) Also, avoid care mistakes. Not only do you disable certain evolutions with it but they'll also reduce your happiness, which will affect the lifetime of your Digimon. Additionally, not feeding means reduced weight - which is bad in many cases, too.  If you feel too insecure about yourself you can still use a guide to learn about the requirements of the Digimon you're aiming for.  -> High stats, high weight, low care mistakes and high happiness/discipline almost gurantee you an evolution which is not green and jelly."
digimon,3cliq2,SydMontague,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:11:55 2015 UTC,"Awesome answer, ty very much.  About megas, i read something about the need to unlock them, so its not training, weight and care mistakes anymore?"
digimon,3cliq2,SydMontague,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:37:58 2015 UTC,"The evolution to megas work the same way as all other evolutions, however there are like 8 evolutions you have to unlock first by doing certain events (most of them through the arena)."
digimon,3cliq2,AliasSigma,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:47:02 2015 UTC,"The idea is that if you constantly train,  they tire out if they can't sleep or nap and that counts as a mistake.  Too many and no good evolution."

digimon,3cliq2,SydMontague,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:52:42 2015 UTC,"You have to balance training, rest, and eventually fighting.  IIRC, it's best to go rest after two-three training sessions.

digimon,3cliq2,SydMontague,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:16:44 2015 UTC,Hum. So can I boost all the stats to try a first mega?
digimon,3cliq2,didroy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:52:26 2015 UTC,"Here are some things that may help your run:   The sweat condition not only can lead to care mistakes and dropped stats but it also lowers happiness, which shortens the amount of time you have as others have said. One thing I've gotten into the habit of doing is actually resting the digimon once when I have to leave to go to the bathroom - it saves me a trip, considering that to avoid the care mistakes you'll have to go back to a bed and rest either way. While it may not seem like it, the time you spend preventing the sweat condition actually is a net gain of time, allowing you to train more while avoiding care mistakes at the same time.  Weight plays a big role in avoiding Numemon. Once you get a decent enough Champion, if you haven't already try prioritizing getting Kudamon and Palmon, who upgrade the meat farm and let you feed things that are both more filling and higher weight gain.  When looking at the guide, you'll see something called a Quota - that's the number of other conditions you have to meet to make it digivolve into that partner. Each stat counts as one condition, and often weight, battles, happiness, discipline, and techniques all play a role. The game is designed in such a way that it gets progressively easier as long as you're not deleting your progress; for example, if you try to learn a few new techniques with each life span, eventually you'll qualify for certain champions with the techniques learned replacing one of the other quotas by default, making it easier to become a Champion. Start with Champions that are easier to obtain and learn as many techniques as you can - this will make it easier to get the ones you want later.    Hope this helps!"
digimon,3cliq2,SydMontague,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:17:42 2015 UTC,"Triedness/Sweat Bubble never counts as care mistake, but the other things are absolutly right.  About the evolution conditions: The number of quote points you can get by stats depends on the level of the target Digimon. For champion Digimon all stats have to be fulfilled and count a one point. For ultimate (dub) Digimon HP/MP, Off/Def and Speed/Brains are grouped together and when you fulfill both requirements in a group you get 1 point (up to 3 points). Only for Mega Digimon each stats counts as seperate quota point."

I don't have a link on hand but you can google ""digimon re digitize patch"" and one of the top links should be a wordpress blog on the english patch. You'll download that and you can do the same for getting the japanese iso. I think I got mine from a particular paradise of emulators (not sure if we can actually link to rom sites and such).  The patch you'll download will have an application you can run. It will ask you to select the iso to patch and then you'll choose a save location and name for the patched result.  Once you do that, you'll have a patched iso!   If you can't figure it out, maybe someone else here can walk you through it.

digimon,3cf9tj,dragons_scorn,-6,Wed Jul 8 00:41:53 2015 UTC,I played it for 2 days before deleting it.

It also wasn't super pleasant to listen to. Always remember, if you're speaking throughout a video it's assumed the main reason people are watching it is to hear you, you don't want things to take away from that. Speaking of volume, you fluctuated multiple times, often going from loud to an almost whisper in rapid succession. For a while I wasn't sure if my speakers were breaking or it was the video.   The information was worthwhile and I learnt a little thing or two, but the sound was draining a lot of potential out of the video. Other than that I can't think of much to complain about, was pretty interesting and I even enjoyed one or two things you said so thanks."

digimon,3c7koc,tim67,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:42:51 2015 UTC,Crunchyroll just got the rights to the first 4 seasons. So Netflix probably let it go/lost it.
digimon,3c7koc,boodude21,0,Mon Jul 6 07:16:26 2015 UTC,"You say that, but the two don't compete.  If you said Hulu got the rights to Digimon, then I would say that there was something to be worried about, as they are competing entities, but where Crunchyroll is an Anime Streaming site whereas Netflix is a general streaming site, one getting rights to it should not play heavily into the other keeping its rights for it."
digimon,3c7koc,enahsg,2,Mon Jul 6 01:40:18 2015 UTC,"That's not how it works. If bamco sold exclusive streaming rights to netflix, then crunchyroll couldn't stream it. Crunchyroll getting the first 4 seasons around the time that Netflix is possibly getting rid of it, means the streaming rights probably changed hands."

digimon,3c6ji8,Harpoon_Torpedo,2,Sun Jul 5 10:34:29 2015 UTC,well i know that you have to get your digimons at the max lvl to evo e.g. garurumon requires to be lvl 20 and then you got some requirements to evo it after. best way to evo it faster is using the same elements as the digimon your lvling up.
digimon,3c6ji8,jaymee1011,2,Sun Jul 5 11:19:00 2015 UTC,"Regarding medium capacitors you can get them starting 'The third trial'  I'm not sure about the limit break, but I think if you max the level of a digimon that cannot digivolve, there's away to increase its level higher than the maximum.

digimon,3c6ji8,enceladus47,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:01:06 2015 UTC,"When leveling up, you pay a set price per sacrifice determined by your level.

digimon,3bznv8,huzaifa96,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:24:57 2015 UTC,I know you might not trust some random person opinion but I imported this at japanese launch and it's been the best digimon game i've played in years. I would say possibly top 3.
digimon,3c2247,KazyX,2,Sat Jul 4 01:10:46 2015 UTC,"The auto-matching follows a specific algorithm. You can choose your first match so that the auto-matches go on for as long as possible.  The auto match will always always match something with the card at the front of the draw pile if it can. If it cannot match something with the front card of the draw pile, then it will make matches within the cards on the board (using wild cards if necessary).  There's still not much strategy, but you might find yourself in situations where choosing a certain combo in the beginning is better/worse than another combo. Overall though the gameplay in Digimon Heroes is pretty shallow."
digimon,3c2247,tw04,2,Sat Jul 4 07:31:41 2015 UTC,"You can save cards but it comes with a sacrifice, if you make a botched combo the game will move on to the next turn, this is only helpful sometimes. Also if your digimon has an evolution 2 skill you can transform 9 to wild cards, again only useful in certain situations"
digimon,3c2247,jvorhes,2,Sat Jul 4 19:34:40 2015 UTC,"Further note, It seems that the auto-picker does not consult the list of future cards when making combos. I've tried to keep track but I don't have a screen recording tool and screenshots are too slow. But I think I've noticed the following when playing:   The auto picker will always attempt to make  combo with the revealed card, top priority.   -from there it will seek out two other numbered cards or one numbered and a wild   If the card revealed is a wild the game will sort though a few rules, this is where more data samples must be collected.   -the following is what is my recollection of what happens, it seems certain variables determine the outcome, more data must be collected.   The game seems to always attempt to make a critical strike, independent of the type advantage/disadvantage.   The game seems to prefer completing attacks for a different class if some combinations have already been made   This is really the only time the game gets wonky but I feel these are two things we can look out for. Its always recommended to ""play"" two cards to see a preview of the upcoming cards and make your initial play accordingly, all things said we need a bigger sample of what happens before a wild card is revealed,and after, then compare for the bigger scheme of selections."
digimon,3c2247,jvorhes,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:58:39 2015 UTC,"Oh also not sure if the game mentioned this or not, but if you clear everything except 1 card on the board the game refills the board and continues the chain. If you clear the entire board your digimon's attacks all turn to critical hits."

Digimon only digivolved in battle if they were a rookie, to stay digivolved outside of battle and begin a battle in a digivolved form it took items that you either won in game or bought with real money (usually the latter), you had about a 2% chance to catch digimon unless you used an item that cost real money, and it was just all sorts of a pain. Plus, for some odd reason, my virus scanner always picked up some program related to it as something worth deleting.

digimon,3bwbrm,pokemonurcle,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:04:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think quashing their enthusiasm is very reasonable in this case.   The only time they would probably have to worry about that would be if they were making a profit off of it or if the program became so popular and widely distributed that it threatened the company's business. And that's assuming the programmer uses a prevalent method of distribution, such as Steam or a mobile app store (which is probably unlikely).   Besides, if they do get trouble, then they could just replace any borrowed assets with original characters and settings. A lot of work but worth it if they can work in peace. The gameplay is the real meat of things like this, anyway."

I'd love to hear some of the ideas you have for battle mechanics as well. Personally, I'd like to see something original, but I am partial to the real time fights of Digimon World 1. I think they could look a little too clunky with 2D sprites, though. But, then again, I did enjoy Digimon World Championship, so I don't see why it couldn't emulate that style.  Any idea yet what you'll be using to program?"
digimon,3bwbrm,theundersigned0,2,Fri Jul 3 07:02:48 2015 UTC,"I was tempted to use RPG maker since I have a copy and a load of assets, but this post kinda gained more notice than I thought it would so I might have to change it to something that would allow bigger and better multiplayer."
digimon,3bwbrm,theundersigned0,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:59:51 2015 UTC,You could definitely have a lot more freedom with your game if you used something other than RPG Maker.
digimon,3bwbrm,theundersigned0,2,Fri Jul 3 19:58:11 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly, currently looking into a better engine but I have absolutely no clue what to choose :/"
digimon,3bwbrm,theundersigned0,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:01:03 2015 UTC,"To preface everything I'm about to say, I'm only a mediocre programmer -- a beginner -- so I would definitely recommend that you find a more informed opinion.  That said, Java offers a lot of cross-platform support, and it's easier to use than some of the more bare-bones languages like C or C++. You could also use a hybrid language like Jython, which can make the programming process a little easier depending on your needs. The only problem with that is if you ever want to allow for mobile support or something like that, you'll have to rewrite a good deal of your program. I would suggest you weigh your options between pure Java and hybrids.  Personally, I've been using Java for my game, and I would definitely recommend it. There's a bit more of a learning curve than RPG Maker, but it's simple once you get the hang of it. And for an RPG, I'd imagine Java would fit most of your needs nicely.   The most significant hurdles you'll have to overcome would probably be the AI and all the art assets. I would definitely recommend that you split your project over 2 or 3 people at least to lighten the load. You could still work on everything yourself, but you'll probably double or triple your development time. These kinds of things need an obscene number of assets.  I would also recommend forgoing any intense multiplayer options unless you're experienced in that field or willing to tack on another couple months of raw learning. If you insist on multiplayer, I think it would be best to start with simple multiplayer battles and then work from there. But it might be best to finish the core game first. Multiplayer is pretty darn complicated.  Before you start the project, I would also recommend getting a list of all the things you need and the extra programs you'll require to make them. For example, Gimp for the art assets, NetBeans IDE for a handy way to visualize the placement of those assets, and a development environment program to make your life easier (NetBeans can double as this, although I personally prefer using a separate program).  Writing down your plans at this stage is pretty crucial, I feel. I have two notebooks full of ideas and brainstorms from my program. And I'd imagine an RPG would require a good deal more planning.  I think your first step should be determining your program's level of complexity. What do you want to accomplish with this game? Do you want simple multiplayer or something akin to an MMO? Will your game have an underlying story or will it be more of a sandbox? Your decisions will help decide what kind of programs are best for you.   Then I think you should decide if you're capable of working on everything yourself or if you would prefer a small team of 2 or 3 like-minded people. Preferably people you know and get along well with. Spreading yourself too thin will probably just frustrate you and lengthen development time a whole lot. In addition, recruiting strangers over the internet could result in conflicting ideas and work styles, not too mention all the communication problems that come with trying to interact over the net.  As soon as you've figured all that stuff out, I'd say it would be high time to start writing out some ideas. Will you include elemental weakness/strengths? What kind of digivolution lines, equipment, stat distribution, stat types, stat weight will you have? What type of progression, leveling/improvement system, goals, story, or player motivation? I think for an RPG the type of progression and story are the most important things to keep in mind.   In terms of a player's motivation and considering that most of the gameplay will probably include battles, I think it's crucial that you decide what will make players actually want to battle and progress through the game. Repetition is the biggest issue, but you can ameliorate the problem by creating tangible goals.   Good luck with your project! I hope you keep in touch with this subreddit if you need any inspiration or have any design questions."

digimon,3bwbrm,Blaise2003,2,Fri Jul 3 20:24:55 2015 UTC,"If you don't have a lot of time I would definitely recommend just writing down any ideas that come to mind in a notebook, especially any pseudo code as that can help you in the long run with figuring out what your original intentions were (in case you take a year off of development like I did :d ).  Even if you don't manage to get much done, you'll at least have everything available whenever you get the opportunity to start. It's easy to forget really cool ideas if you spend a lot of time thinking about something else."

digimon,3bxot0,lalalasheep,3,Fri Jul 3 00:35:38 2015 UTC,"It's definitely not just an anime. It started off as a battling Tamagotchi style virtual pet before evolving into a franchise with multiple virtual pets, card games, video games that often have vastly different playstyles, anime and Manga that all take place in their own worlds, etc.  Basically feel free to start anywhere."
digimon,3bxot0,dotyawning,2,Fri Jul 3 00:56:08 2015 UTC,"The games are disconnected to no end.  Even the show only had the first two series connected, season 2 taking place 3 years after season 1 (you could argue that season 3 and possibly is connected, but that is reading so far between the lines that it is not worth it).  The only games that are connected are Digimon World Dusk and Dawn.  In terms of what you should play, if you want to play an old school one, I would say play Digimon World 3 (PS1).  The first 1 wasn't that good, and honestly, I never had a chance to check out the second one, so I can't really tell you that one is good or bad.  After 3, the games took a nose dive, up until Digimon World DS, and then they got really good, so I would say any game Digimon World DS and later would be another good option (keep in mind that I am only talking about the Digimon RPG's, so I wouldn't know if the fighters or any other Digimon games are any good)."
digimon,3bxot0,enahsg,2,Fri Jul 3 00:54:18 2015 UTC,"I would highly recommend giving Digimon World 2 a try! I much preferred it over Digimon World 3 because it gives you the ability to tame or create any digimon from the first generation, rather than be stuck to a small selection. There's a lot less exploration, but to me it was tons more fun!"

Also just so you know it is possibly one of the grindiest rpgs I have played and it is dungeon crawler if you are not into that type of game but overall it is still pretty fun.

As for games I really enjoyed most of them. I would recommend Digimon World 1/Re:Digitize(pretty much a reboot of world 1), Worlds 2,3 and Dawn/Dusk as I find them the most enjoyable. Something to keep in mind when playing the games though is that Digimon don't have set digivolution paths unlike pokemon so Agumon might not always Digivolve into Greymon in the games since I was confused by this when I was younger."

Also, I think Savers is shit, I watched it and I didn't enjoy any of it.  edit: oh and for people who prefer the dub, it is shit unless you're watching it in latin american dub, the only reason laton american dub is good is because they kept the essence of the series with the soundtrack.

Our War Game was paired up with a One Piece film, Hurricane Touchdown/Golden Digimentals was paired with the Ojomajo Doremi film at the time, and Diablomon Strikes Back with another One Piece film, from what I can remember.  With the third film, being longer, was split into two films and was coupled with the Doremi film which was pretty short.  I don't remember if the Tamers films were part of double-features...

digimon,3bu837,likeagrapefruit,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:08:40 2015 UTC,So it means that every one of the digimons could have another mega form?
digimon,3bu837,fagnerd,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:32:18 2015 UTC,"Yup! The way I see it, Digimon amass data in order to digivolve (unless the are relying on borrowed energy from a partner/tamer) so wouldn't it make sense that their evolution would be based on the type of data they absorb? (And isn't that already proven by Aegiomon's evolutions?)"
digimon,3bu837,japzone,2,Thu Jul 2 06:11:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like in Tamers, Gilmon mega digivolved into that evil form when Takato forced him, but then later when he biomerged with Takato they became Gallantmon."
digimon,3bu837,Grahf,2,Thu Jul 2 06:17:17 2015 UTC,"Same in Season 1 when Taichi tries to force Greymon into Ultimate stage, and inadvertently digivolved him into Skullgreymon."
digimon,3bu837,likeagrapefruit,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:19:33 2015 UTC,"They can all have several Mega forms. Angewomon for example has also been shown to evolve into Babamon, Beelzebumon, Dynasmon X-Antibody, Hououmon, Lilithmon, MarinAngemon, Omegamon, and Seraphimon among others."
digimon,3bu837,shadowpikachu,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:34:34 2015 UTC,"Thats why in games there are 2 ways it goes, normal path and the screwy path.  Digimon just digivolve to their surroundings, nature and bodies."

digimon,3bu837,Johntoreno,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:32:46 2015 UTC,"I think when Tailmon was created, the original digivolution was Magnadramon, and that's consistent in the earlier anime, the Digimon Tamer Battle Evolution, Wonderswan games for Ryo. Digimon Battle Spirit 1.5 used Orphanimon, and the anime (Frontier), and other games  after that geared towards that evolution (D-Project WS, DS games). I would guess it's probably due to the connotations to Patamon's evolution line and the creators wanted a female humanoid version to the Angemon line."
digimon,3bu837,zsmg,2,Thu Jul 2 10:49:29 2015 UTC,"Why do people make such a big deal out of Tailmon's MEGA? SERIOUSLY!? did digimon fans just freaking forget that Digimon can have multiple mega forms and there's no such thing as a ""True"" form? Gennai explained that Skullgreymon wasn't an incorrect evolution it just wasn't the right one for the kids.  And Plus i hate magnadramon... she looks like a giant pink weasel."
digimon,3bu837,heartonmysleeve85,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:32:42 2015 UTC,"Wha... you use the Japanese name for Tailmon but American name for Ultimate and Holydramon. That's not confusing what so ever... :p  Personally I don't want to be reminded of the Ultimate evolution of Patamon and Tailmon in Digimon Hurricane Touchdown. Seeing them warp evolve to ultimate for only for them to disappear 5 seconds later, so they could give a powerup to Vmon and Terriermon, left such a bitter aftert aste in my mouth. I'm getting salty by just thinking about it..."

digimon,3bsxgg,deliciousdave33,2,Wed Jul 1 21:55:34 2015 UTC,"Let's start with Digimon World 1, as I exactly know how it works.  Digimon World 1  The evolution system in DW1 knows 4 requirements:   Stats: Every Digimon requires some stats, e.g. Greymon 100 Offense, Defense, Speed and Brains. You only fulfill this requirement if you match or exeed ALL required stats. Weight: Every Digimon has a target weight (e.g. Greymon 30). You fulfill this requirement when you are in a +- range of this weight (-> 25-35 for Greymon) Care Mistakes*: They're either minimal or maximal care mistakes, depending on the Digimon. Bonus: This contains a variety of possible requirements like minimal/maximal battles, a certain happiness/discipline level, an amount of learned techs or having a certain Digimon as current Digimon. However, you only need ONE of these for this condition - having more bonus criteria fulfilled won't give you any advantage.   To enable a evolution you have to fulfill 3 out of these 4 requirements. After a certain amount of time (6h, 24h, 72h and 144h depending on your level - due to in the sleeping system this can happen a bit sooner or later) you will evolve if you enabled at least one evolution. If not you'll evolve to Numemon after 96h on the Rookie level and you can evolve to Vademon after 240h on the Champion level by praising/scolding your Digimon.  If you fulfill the requirement for 2 or more Digimon at the point evolution the priority system takes over. The game will build the average of the stats that are required for the target Digimon (HP and MP divided by 10). That means for a Greymon it will add together the values of offense, defense, speed and brains and divide it by 4. Based on this every Digimon get's a score assigned and the Digimon with the highest score is the Digimon you will evolve into. (1st Priority System) In the case that there are 2 Digimon with the same highest score, it will chose the Digimon that has the higher ranking in the evolution chart of you current Digimon. (2nd Priority System)  *Care Mistakes in DW1 are:   pooping on the ground not feeding until the bubble disappears by itself (can count twice while training!) not sleeping until the bubble disappears   Things like tiredness or running away from battles are NOT a care mistake.    Re:Digitize  As for Re:Digitize I'd first like to inform you that my research in this field is VERY basic so far and therefore might contain errors and is surely incomplete.  Re:Digitize uses the same values as requirements (stats, weight, care mistakes, happiness, discipline, battles, techs) but it seems like the former bonus criteria can now count more than once towards the requirement count. The only mechanical change seems to be weight which is now either minimal or maximal weight as well.  Again you have to fulfill a certain amount of requirements to evolve after a set amount of time (6h, 20h, 41h 40min, 80h, 86h 40min). To get Numemon your Rookie's lifetime and evolution timer (which counts down instead of up as in DW1) must've sunken to 0.  However, the priority systems in Re:Digitize works differently. For Baby II -> Rookie it seems to use the same/a similar stats based priority system as DW1, effectivly determining the Rookie you get solely on the highest stat you have. However for Champion evolutions (and probably above) there seems to be a much simpler system in place that is similar to the 2nd Priority System of DW1, meaning if you enabled 2 evolutions it will always give you the same Digimon, unless you disable the one with the higher priority. This effectivly often prevents you from getting certain evolutions in the later game if you start with high base stats and a lot of techs, that enable one requirement by default.  This is probably the reason for the insane amount of Gaogomon's and Meramon's I had to observe so far...  Edit: After more tests I can safely say that the priority system is more complex as ""Digimon X has always priority over Digimon Y"". It seems to matter what requirements you fulfill. All data I have so far is weird and confusing, making it hard for me to find a pattern that can be applied to all Digimon..."
digimon,3bsxgg,SydMontague,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:40:18 2015 UTC,so how would I go about making 1 evolution the priority when I have all the stats for 2 digimon?
digimon,3bsxgg,SydMontague,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:50:14 2015 UTC,"Assuming you're playing Re:Digitize, you would have to make sure that you don't fulfill enough requirements for the Digimon you don't want by changing the values you still have influence on (weight, care mistakes, battles, happiness and discipline). Without knowing the exact requirements, this can become a quite troublesome task. You'd basically have to trail and error until you get the evolution you want (-> you have to lead quite often). In the worst case it's actually impossible to get certain evolutions once you got a certain level of stats."
digimon,3bsxgg,aholeinyourbackyard,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:10:30 2015 UTC,"It also seems like some digivolutions in Re:Digitize have one or more requirements you have to meet regardless of what other requirements you meet. At least, this is the only way I can explain how I have never ever been able to get a digimon to become Megadramon without meeting the 25 battles requirement,"
digimon,3bsxgg,SydMontague,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:35:44 2015 UTC,"A bit late, but better later than never. :P  I didn't observe any mandatory requirements so far, only the quota system and was able to get Megadramon without 25 battles - so you probably didn't fulfill enough requirements in general.^"
digimon,3bsxgg,aholeinyourbackyard,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:54:12 2015 UTC,"Probably! This is from before I knew about Ultimates having their stat requirements coupled, so who knows how many requirement points I actually had."
digimon,3bsxgg,DylanKing001,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:04:02 2015 UTC,"If it's the natural digivolution line then I think it has a slightly higher chance, otherwise just try to fill more of the one you wants quota"

Let's take Oikawa for example, he got a digimon but no digivice to help fight the darkness. The DigiDestined/Tamers/Legendary Warriors all were called upon to serve their purpose in the grand design of the DIgiWorld whereas the Digimon partners that everyone gets at the end of 02 didn't also come with a digivice."
digimon,3bovrz,SydMontague,3,Fri Jul 3 06:58:26 2015 UTC,"If it helps, when Toei released their English tri. announcement trailer, they titled it ""For all the 'DigiDestined' in the world"", giving legitimacy to the term for at least the Adventure fans.  I'd go with [Digimon] Tamers, as a Tamer is the generic term for people with Digimon partners."
digimon,3bovrz,MagicCoat,3,Wed Jul 1 01:48:02 2015 UTC,"Well, for franchises that create a world parallel to our own that can only be accessed or experienced by being chosen or destined I feel it's quite natural that the fandom implies that it's members fulfill these requirements - after all that is what you usually hope to be. ;)  Due to DigiDestined being a group of undefined size, one can easily keep up the illusion that the term ""DigiDestined"" didn't lose it's significance due to too many people identifying themself with it. And this becomes even more true when you consider that the Digimon fandom is relativly small.  A fandom like GoT would have to chose a more general term like Unsullied or Crows due to the lack of groups with undefined size and especially the longlivity of things within the show. After all, there can only be one Tyrion, only 7 king's guards, a hand full members of house X and so on.  If you have a better idea than DigiDestined, go ahead and spread it.

I feel like we could grow up at about the same rate and both have similar and appropriate maturity levels.   In terms of within the anime, my favorite was BlackWargreymon, who just spent so much of his life looking for his purpose. Then, despite being largely seen as a threat his whole life, he devoted the last part of his life to something really noble, and was remembered sacrificing himself for others. All his talks about wondering whether digimon like himself had a heart really got to me as a kid."

digimon,3bm6rr,HastyCapablanca,14,Tue Jun 30 10:04:33 2015 UTC,I'll definitely have to disagree. Not that Digimon's music is particularly bad but more that a lot of Pokemon music is god tier.
digimon,3bm6rr,SSJ5Gogetenks,6,Tue Jun 30 14:29:44 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say god tier because that category belongs to the final fantasy soundtracks but Pokemon battle themes are always motivating.However, the background music on DW1's areas were very immersive,unlike the soundtrack that plays when you're adventuring in Pokemon."
digimon,3bm6rr,ygglow,-8,Wed Jul 1 04:25:35 2015 UTC,"Any particular example you should mention? Funny how you people claim that Pokemon music is 'god-tier' when you can't even provide a single, representative track. Rules of basic debate, people!"
digimon,3bm6rr,SSJ5Gogetenks,4,Tue Jun 30 14:47:18 2015 UTC,"This is my favourite. In fact, almost all of RSE's battle themes were fantastic."
digimon,3bm6rr,SSJ5Gogetenks,-2,Tue Jun 30 15:13:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Sapphire was my first Pokemon game, and I remember this track well.   But this is definitely not 'god-tier'. I agree with it being 'fantastic', but not 'god-tier'. This is the best RSE has to offer, nothing more. Anything else? This, this, and this just sound too bland and same-y to be hailed as god-tier."
digimon,3bm6rr,xarel1375,7,Tue Jun 30 15:31:38 2015 UTC,"Well that's all subjective isn't it :)  Here's another good one from a different generation. In particular, part of what I really like about this one is the big ominous intro, and then just as the battle interface comes up and the player gains control, the sick bass starts, and from there the intensity escalates."
digimon,3bm6rr,xarel1375,-2,Tue Jun 30 15:34:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed, my friend. But that does not strip words like 'better', 'fantastic', and 'god-tier' off their pragmatics."
digimon,3bm6rr,TheGamer821,8,Tue Jun 30 15:43:44 2015 UTC,"Okay I will give you this.  The anime music in Digimon is better than most of the music in the Pokémon anime.  Game-wise though I find Pokémon to have some of the best music in all of gaming. This is coming someone who has played Digimon World 1, 2, 3, Card Battle, the one fighting game on PS1, and Dusk..  Except the fourth generation music. Digimon beats the fourth generation Pokémon music... Except for the Giratina battle in Platinum and Heartgold/ Soulsilver."
digimon,3bm6rr,Animedingo,2,Tue Jun 30 14:31:52 2015 UTC,"Ah, yes. Here's the link to the Giratina Battle theme, in case anyone wants to hear.  Great example of Pokemon music, but not enough to convince me that it's ""some of the best music in all of gaming"". It's definitely not something I would group along with the compositions of Nobuo Uematsu or that of Miki Higashino. It's not even something I find better than the track I posted. Matter of personal taste, I guess? Or maybe I just find it too same-y with other Pokemon battle tracks that it doesn't exactly stand out? Okay,this is merely my opinion. Let's just agree to disagree."
digimon,3bm6rr,burek_japrak,2,Tue Jun 30 15:02:26 2015 UTC,"It may be a matter of opinion on both sides. To be fair though, I know many people who don't play Pokémon or much video games any more, yet they can still hum the original Gym theme or battle theme.  I concede though compared to Mr. Uematsu or Yoko Shimomura the music in Pokémon isn't as good"
digimon,3bm6rr,wanahmadfiras,2,Tue Jun 30 16:41:38 2015 UTC,I disagree for the 8 Bit era but after that the composers of pokemon music really didn't know what they were doing until gen 5. Then they dropped again in XY and figured it out again in ORAS.
digimon,3bm6rr,zsmg,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:15:24 2015 UTC,I'm not saying Pokemon's music was bad. I'm saying I'd rather be in the Gold Hawk Headquarters than in any Pokemon Gym.

digimon,3bmo2k,Mixkon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:50:04 2015 UTC,Well you have around four more areas till the third trial.  I try to have balanced team with one Digimon from each color and don't usually change it for different areas. But when I pick a companion I choose one with a digimon that's strong against this area (green Digimon against blue for example). It really helps.

digimon,3bmo2k,Versaileys,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:04:29 2015 UTC,I have a bunch of questions if anybody knows that could help.   Is there a way to check digivolution requirements of a character before they reach max level? Is the only way to level up Digimon through digifusing fodder digimon into them? When people talk about grinding they keep mentioning selling digimon for money. Is it better to sell it for money rather than use it to level up your existing digimon? Is there any other point in money besides using it to pay for digifusion and digivolution?
digimon,3bmo2k,tw04,2,Tue Jun 30 23:28:16 2015 UTC,"When I digifuse I usually use the same digimon I'm fusing as it gives more xp. Like only use patamons to level up patamons, but if I get a gatomon I'd sell it."
digimon,3bmo2k,Cylon_Toast,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:13:25 2015 UTC,"But in the ""how to"" section of the game it says fusing of the same race gives extra exp. Both Patamon and Gatomon are the same race (holy) so fusing Gatomon would be even more exp than fusing Patamon. Also wouldn't it make more sense to keep Gatomons and fuse everything into Gatomon since she's way better than Patamon?"
digimon,3bmo2k,tw04,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:56:59 2015 UTC,"I thought by race it meant same exact digimon. I'm not actually doing patamon, it was an example."
digimon,3bmo2k,Cylon_Toast,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:27:16 2015 UTC,Oh okay. Yeah honestly I'm not 100% sure about the race thing. Did it give you an indicator that you were receiving extra exp when you digifused the same digimon together?
digimon,3bmo2k,tw04,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:37:23 2015 UTC,"In the how to play section under the cog menu it also states that higher rarity yields more xp so using tailmon (gatomon) to level patamon from the example above would net more xp wich is better in the earlier levels as its less expensive to digifuse,  i raised a tyilinmon from level 1 to level 20 with 4 lvl 1 angemons and a level 14 one for the cost of 500 credits"

digimon,3bnaau,dotyawning,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:38:08 2015 UTC,Digimon Heroes. The localized version of Digimon Crusader.  Hard Drives are monster box limit expansions.

digimon,3bnaau,dotyawning,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:53:05 2015 UTC,"iOS and Android. It's out in certain regions right now, but not US as far as I know. I downloaded it from an APK someone linked to last week."
digimon,3bnaau,enceladus47,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:01:16 2015 UTC,Does the game have an Autoplay feature/Energy?
digimon,3bnaau,tw04,2,Tue Jun 30 23:27:51 2015 UTC,"There's energy, but for the first 20 or so ranks, I've yet to actually use it up before ranking up.  As for autoplay,  the mechanics seem to make it like half autoplay at all times.  You have a hand of cards to play, and can see the cards that are coming up. When you make a combo of three matching colored cards, the game takes over and makes matches of the remaining cards, taking some sort of color preference order and taking from the pile of cards that is coming up first.  Honestly if it wasn't Digimon, I probably wouldn't have been playing for as long as I have... but I can see myself forgetting about it completely soon enough. It isn't quite my style of gameplay."
digimon,3bn8iw,fattristan2,6,Tue Jun 30 16:07:08 2015 UTC,"I'll start. I actually had the D-3s with my friends on my block growing up, and my partner was Gargomon. We had a blood pact to always put saving the world before all other things; one time my D-3 went off during a test and I ran to the bathroom to go address the attack, and my buddy was there waiting for me with his D-3 as well. The most extreme day was the day we both had to take down the third boss (we tried to sync ourselves as much as possible and take down bosses together), and my buddy was on a date when his went off. He actually left the date to go save the world with me. I forget what excuse he made up to get out of it, but she was actually pretty understanding of it and they had a make up date the next day. But she never knew that we were secretly saving the world on the side - we kept that a secret from anyone that wasn't also a Digidestined."
digimon,3bn8iw,throwaway021192,3,Tue Jun 30 16:36:17 2015 UTC,"I think the most memorable day as a kid was one time my childhood friend and I defeated Malomyotismon the day of a city-wide garage sale. My hometown has an annual thing where all the people will host a garage sale the same day and then travel in between them. The Season 2 of the show just ended, and I was right there with my Hawkmon saving the day with them. We celebrated with my friend and his Patamon by touring the garage sales, and hidden in one neighbor's toybox was a Myotismon figure. We freaked out and were like ""Oh my god, he's still alive!"" And then we bought the toy and buried it in the backyard so that it could never harm anyone else. To this day, we tell the story as though Malomyotismon wasn't actually dead at the end of Season 2, and we dealt the finishing blow ourselves."
digimon,3bn8iw,frankiealexandrite,2,Tue Jun 30 16:41:49 2015 UTC,"Armadillomon for me. He and I have had many adventures. I remember him not having quite as exaggerated of an accent as the one on the show. Many times we would battle with friends or fight the bad guy. I remember when I discovered that through a convoluted way he could become Cannondramon, and we did so and stopped NoirGreymon (Personal creation of mine. Think BlackWarGreymon except with a more medieval knight design and a red cape.)  Been a while since I thought of Armadillomon. Maybe it's time for that childhood imagination to come back and write out some adventures."

Those were her first words when we meet, also i am male, i got mad, gatomon laught, we fight, she defeat me easily, after that she started coming from time to time, each time more early than before, before i would see gatomon once a week, then slowly 2 times per week, after some time she started to appear only once per month, we chat, laught, and talk about the past and hobbies. One time she did not come for over a month and i got worried, after a while walking around i saw her, weak, exhausted in a abandoned empty lot, i rush to her to help her, she saw me with a smile and disappear in from of my eyes before i could even reach her, my eyes got watery, i cry like like never before that day, that night i could not sleep at all. Almost at morning i hear some weird sounds coming from the windows, a look at the windows and i see something that was not there before, i stand up and come close to it and there was a blue and white D-3 on it, i grab it and a flash of light blind me for a second, when i open my eyes again a big red dot is pointing to the windows, i open it and look outside, right under the windows a small Nyaromon was outside under the windows, dirty, exhausted and with a big smile told me ""We meet again""."

digimon,3bn8iw,alwc37,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:53:42 2015 UTC,"It's strange on just how much Guilmon and my life changed since that day we met. It was around four years ago on a warm summer day in September. Freshmen year just started and I was nervous going into High School. On the way back from home I heard a pleading voice asking for help. I thought nothing of it and just kept walking until I heard it again. It was coming from the forest near me. I knew the area pretty well so I wouldn't get lost. I went chasing the voice only to see a bright light in a clearing. It was clear the voice was coming from it and when I approached the light I just heard ""You... are worthy of this task."" The light exploded and swallowed me. When I came to I had two things that I knew from my childhood near me: A D-Arc and a pile of cards from the Digimon trading card game. It was at that moment when an egg came floating down onto my lap. When I touched the egg it glowed brightly and then just like that, there he was. My soon to be best friend, Guilmon.  Hiding him was a nightmare but it has gotten a little easier. Certain people know about me being a tamer but they're all quiet about it. I still remember my parents faces when I had to tell them. Together we have accomplished amazing things. We even saved the world once from another Digimon known as ""Millenniummon."" We almost died in the fight against him, but we were able to win based off of the whole world cheering for us (thank god no one can recognize me anymore) and that I came up with the crazy idea of copying the show. It worked, who knew we'd be able to Matrix Evolve?  After the battle we were separated. A dimensional rift was created at Millenniummon's grave and I got pulled in leaving Guilmon in the Digital world. The last thing we said to each other was promising to see one another again. I spent the next four years living a normal life once again. My identity was hidden pretty well but I constantly got teased by the people that did know as the ""Legendary Tamer.""   Four years later in the present year a Digimon began spawning in my town. At first I thought it was Guilmon. When I entered the Digital Zone I instead found a DarkTyrannomon. But when I was about to be clobbered, Guilmon appeared and saved me. Back together we took it down quick and got out of there to have our little reunion. I thought I would live my life out in peace but not long after we were forced into a secret service. While I was off my Tamer duties for those four years a group of individuals became not only Tamers but figured out a way to make a portal to the Digital World so Digimon can come through. These new Tamers made some underground Digimon fighting league. Now all the Tamers of the past have joined forces to stop these new guys and I was made leader of them. I don't know how our new adventure will end for Guilmon and I, but at least we know we'll be together at the end of it.  (P.S. Great thread! Had a lot of fun thinking up a story on the spot and reading the stories that others made! )"

I feel like Pokemon - being set in a natural world - betrays itself when it comes up with designs like these. Like, what, how ridiculous is it for a keychain to live in the wild?! Pokemon does not have the same liberty as Digimon because Digimon capitalizes upon the unreal, the otherworldly dimension besides our own. It's quite neat when you realize it, as it completely justifies designs like Sukamon or Nanimon."

digimon,3bkxll,HastyCapablanca,0,Tue Jun 30 01:51:55 2015 UTC,but is there a way to play it without a japanese 3ds lol?  edit: i guess i mean is the 3ds region locked.  I know the Wii is
digimon,3bkxll,NotAFgt,2,Tue Jun 30 01:53:07 2015 UTC,"The 3ds is region locked so unless you have a japanese console or some way to circumvent the region lock there's not much you can do, unfortunately.   If you do have a way to play it there are apps that can take pictures and translate stuff for you, though I would say to study up on japanese grammar and have a dictionary with you. Japanese has a lot of homonyms and implicit quirks that make it very difficult to translate via technology.   And finally, if you don't mind waiting the team that did the psp translation are currently working on a 3ds english patch. By the time it's done hopefully 3ds cfw or emulators have progressed far enough to be viable. Flashcards are still an option if you have the cash though."

digimon,3bjp25,blazehomewrecker,5,Mon Jun 29 19:51:00 2015 UTC,"The Dub of Tamers is actually really good. Aside from the disappointing intro song, there are very few censorships in comparison to adventure, the voice acting is really good, and the music during the actual show (during digimodify and digivolution) really pumps you up and brings on the feeling of a badass adrenaline rush. I really love this dub, I would try it out if I were you!"
digimon,3bjp25,Labrynna,4,Tue Jun 30 00:32:27 2015 UTC,"I only switched to subs come Savers, since it was pretty obvious that there'd be things that wouldn't be allowed for the english versions. Other than that, the first four seasons are fine as dubs."
digimon,3bjp25,Sea-Salt,2,Mon Jun 29 20:43:48 2015 UTC,"While the subs do portray certain characters in a more complex and interesting way (e.g. Puppetmon/Pinocchimon), I would hate to watch the entire first season without hearing the pun ""they didn't stand a GHOST of a chance""."
digimon,3bjp25,doom-bubble,3,Mon Jun 29 21:02:38 2015 UTC,"The US dub is a different show compared to the japanese original.  Changed dialogue, changed music and some deleted/shortened scenes simply make it hard for me to accept that the show I watched as kid is supposed to be the same as the US dub.  Also, if I compare the german dub (which kept itself very close to the original) with the original, the japanese voice acting is simply another level (even if I don't understand a word). From what I've seen from the US dub, I'd say it's even worse - but as I was never used to them that might be not very objective...  -> sub, except you really want to watch the dub for nostalgia reasons.   Edit: Another, way better, solution would be: why not both? It gives you the position to actually compare them yourself and to notice the true beauty of Digimon, multiple watch throughs are recommended anyways. ;)"
digimon,3bjp25,SydMontague,5,Mon Jun 29 21:25:43 2015 UTC,"The only reason I'd want to watch it in English is for the familiarity rather than nostalgia, I have this silly feeling that watching it in Japanese would be like learning something new, and all the subtle differences seem odd i.e Evolution over Digivolution, Tailmon over Gatomon that and my love of Hikari's voice actor is something I'd miss.  I never though of watching it both languages, what a simple yet amazing idea  Thanks"
digimon,3bjp25,poltergoose420,2,Mon Jun 29 21:52:20 2015 UTC,How exactly is the dub a different show?
digimon,3bjp25,SydMontague,4,Tue Jun 30 21:55:46 2015 UTC,"The medium of videos (-> movies, TV shows) consists out of 3 main layers: 1. The moved image 2. The (voice) acting (including dialogue script and the actual acting) 3. The sound (including sound effects and music)    Within each layer is information encoded that is supposed to transmit a message to the viewer. These messages are, what a show defines. However, by changing only one these layers you risk to lose some messages. And obviously, the more you change, the higher the chance that you lose, or even worse add, a message.  For things like this, localization is indeed hell, as you can easily miss a hidden message within the dialogue or encounter something that's either not translateable (e.g. many jokes) or wouldn't be understandable by the local audience if translated directly. But whatever you do should try to keep the message as original as possible.  Now, let's take a look at the US dubbed version of Digimon. Some scenes got shortened or cutted, the dialogue got modified by a great extend and the sound/music - a whole layer - got replaced completly. With changes of this size you can safely assume that a lot of messages are either lost or altered from what the original authors of the show intended.  What Saban did simply doesn't comply to what I understand of a ""localization"", namely to make a product accessable in another language without altering it's messages (too much). They clearly intended to tell the story differently from the original and therefore created an interpretation of the original Digimon instead of a localization -> a different show.    To give another popular example: Game of Thrones is an interpretation of the Books by Georg R.R. Martin. They have a lot in common, but still have major differences in them that make it impossible to claim that both are equal. (Well, tbh, porting something to another media is ALWAYS an interpretation.)"

I haven't watched digimon in a long time and wound up on this sub on a whim today, bit from what I recall the first season was really rambling and had no sense of direction or larger plot, then there was like a ten year time skip and suddenly like six new digi destined."
digimon,3bjp25,Romiress,2,Tue Jun 30 23:23:49 2015 UTC,"If you want nostalgia, watch dub. Otherwise, you're almost always going to be better off in the sub. The English scripts, especially in the early season, are quite different and change a lot of little things."

digimon,3bgwmf,Jamesathan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:44:31 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about it XD  I mean its such a horrendous grind, I dunno if the game is actually worth playing."
digimon,3bh1zc,NotAFgt,4,Mon Jun 29 03:56:33 2015 UTC,"The passed down stats are 1%*(TamerLevel+1) from what I've observed so far.  The game has a priority and evolution system that probably resembles closly to the one of DW1. In DW1 the Digimon with the highest average of his required stats won and this is easily reproduceable in R:D with Rookie Digimon, assuming they only require one stat each. However I havent dug deeper into the evolution/priority system of R:D so I can't give you exact data right now.   If you want to avoid certain evolutions you already got, just take a look at his requirements in the evolution chart and try to not fulfill them. And yes, sometimes a care mistake is very helpful."
digimon,3bh1zc,SydMontague,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:14:31 2015 UTC,What does it mean if a care requirement says -5? Does it mean that I should have made less than 5 mistakes or not less than 5 mistakes? I'm asking because there are also ones which ask for +10
digimon,3bh1zc,vanitas14,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:47:25 2015 UTC,The game doesn't tell you such numbers so I don't know. The guide you're using should probably explain it's notation of such values.  I'd assume that - means maximal care mistakes and + minimal care mistakes. You could look up Birdramon which I know needs at least 1 care mistake.
digimon,3bh1zc,SydMontague,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:06:51 2015 UTC,"I did a little experiment. Had my Agumon fulfill the stat requirements for both Angemon and GeoGreymon. It digivolved into Angemon. So does this mean Angemon is prioritized over GeoGreymon? I can't be sure, but I hypothesize that it has something to do with how the digivolutions are ordered. Since Angemon is above GeoGreymon, Angemon must be higher in priority.   Did a second experiment with the same Agumon. I had it poop once. It digivolved into GeoGreymon. Note that Angemon requires zero care mistakes. So does this, mean negating at least one quota of a digivolution higher in priority leads to digivolving into the digivolution next in priority, given that your Rookie fulfills the stat requirements of both? I know the chart on GeoGreymon says that it's much easier to digivolve into if your Rookie has one care mistake, but even with that, and even if I was unable to fulfill Angemon's quota on care mistakes, I still had fulfilled the stat requirements which add up to 3 quotas (the bare minimum required for Angemon). Ah, this is getting really confusing. I'm now really starting to question the relevance of the guide's required number quotas"
digimon,3bh1zc,HastyCapablanca,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:19:14 2015 UTC,"I still haven't dug deep into the evolution system - mostly because I want to not spoil myself too much - however I can you explain the DW1 system.  In DW1 there are 2 priority systems in place: System A. It calculates the average of all required stats (HP and MP divided by 10) and compares it to all enabled evolutions. The evolution with the highest value is the one you get. System B. If there are 2 Digimon with the same score in System A it gets chosen by the order in the current Digimon's evolution chart.  As I made some tests today, I'm pretty sure the priority system works different. Nothing reliable yet, but it looks like getting GeoGreymon is quite hard as normal Greymon always seems to have priority over it if both are enabled. As you might see, GeoGreymon is higher in the list, so the whole priority stuff is probably way more complex. ;) I'll continue to research in this field eventually, but first I want to reach all/almost all Digimon without normal playing. ^"
digimon,3bh1zc,SydMontague,4,Mon Jun 29 21:00:10 2015 UTC,you can always choose to not inherit stats to make sure you can choose your champion.
digimon,3bgl6a,umBERK,6,Mon Jun 29 01:16:39 2015 UTC,"As others have said, the storyline is completely different, but many of the mechanics are similar enough that you can pick it up if you played the first one. Here are some differences I've noticed:  Good changes:    Generally speaking the stats for Champions and Ultimates are a little lower than before, and there are considerably more digimon to choose from, so variety is more readily available.  You can now save anywhere, anytime.  There's considerably more time to get to the bathroom if your digimon has to poop, which will lower care mistakes. The early meat farms give a little more than before.  Some items are cheaper, and some services are cheaper. Most notably Birdramon went from being 2,000 for the cheapest flights to about  200 - the most expensive one I've found so far is 700.  I never really got the hang of intermediate training at gyms when I was a kid (it felt too luck based), but it is much more skill based with exception to the brains stat. Offense, Defense, Speed, and HP are basically twitch reflexes, and MP is a memorization game. You can still do beginner and just skip all that though. Unlike the first game, which had tons of glitches, I have yet to see any instance where the game just crashes (like Giromon's Jukebox in DW).    Other changes and notes:   They took away the farting sounds. Admittedly this was very juvenile to begin with, but I sort of miss it.  Battles are much harder to avoid, and in some cases impossible to avoid. The digimon will home in on you and you can't unrun them. The only way to avoid them is to have a digimon that the wild encounter naturally will ignore longer or run from.  Discipline works differently. I don't really see digimon refusing food when hungry if low discipline, but I do see them disobeying orders. The game has a weird thing though where some evolutions have low discipline as a requirement, which makes life after evolution harder - you have to make a choice between shortening the lifespan by disciplining in compensation, or risking death when they disobey you and get dogpiled in battle.  Sweat status seems to have more drastic consequences. Happiness drops at a seemingly faster rate.  While the game overall seems easier, I have considerably more money problems in this version than the original. I'm actually finding myself devoting a generation to just farming money and food.  I haven't seen any explicit confirmation yet, but they strongly imply this game takes place after DW1 (and possibly DW2). For example, they talk about how Birdramon was brought to the city and provided transportation, but then left when she started a family.    Hope this helps, and enjoy the game! Overall I find a lot of the ways they made it easier to be things that actually annoyed me in the first game, so I consider this one a noticeable improvement - normally I'm against modernization making games easier, but a lot of the changes they made are ones I particularly had an issue with to begin with. There's a challenge, then there's fun breaking at the expense of arbitrary extra work."
digimon,3bgl6a,didroy,3,Mon Jun 29 14:22:35 2015 UTC,"It's a different game that has the same basic gameplay mechanics. There are some similarities (it takes place in the same world), but it's not at all a remake - more of a sequel than anything, technically."
digimon,3bgl6a,butterfly1763,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:18:58 2015 UTC,"Id say this is a easier version of the original game. With basic knowledge of the game you should have your first or second digimon already become a Ultimate, then third or 4th a Mega, then you have probably beat the main story already.  Its a good game but it suffers from the common modern problem of being made easier then the original."
digimon,3bgl6a,Hulkkis,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:47:40 2015 UTC,"Re:Digitize has a completly different story and different places (although technically they play on the same island) and maybe twice as much obtainable Digimon now including the previously non-existent Ultimate(sub)/Mega level.  Gameplay wise they're actually quite close to each other. Train you stats, feed your Digimon, bring it to a toilet, avoid tiredness and eventually evolve to a (cooler) form that doesn't always make sense and ofc battle other Digimon. Many of these systems are either copied 1:1 from DW1 or modified versions of them. However, Re:Digitize doesn't do many of the mistakes DW1 did, like the mysterious evolution system or the lack of guidance in the beginning (if you get Numemon as first champion in R:D you're just bad at video games or did it on purpose), what makes it overall a way better game than DW1.  -> They're 2 completly different games, but if you entercounter a system in R:D that seems similar to one from DW, you are usually safe to assume that it works the same or at least in a similar way."

The EXP is also pretty amazing.  EDIT: So after grinding here for a bit I've realized it's better for EXP & Bits rather than leveling up Digimon. Tailmon sells for 480 bits, if you play some of the following levels you find other adult digimon and the level up exp is about the same, so it makes more sense to sell tailmon and the child digimon from here."

I just drag it down and click on it once it is done. It then gives me the option to install it.   If you put it on your pc, then you would plug your phone in and transfer it over. You would then need a file explorer app that would allow you to go find it and install it from there. The one I use is called Astro file manager."

digimon,3b5x3h,gallyguru,4,Fri Jun 26 20:08:19 2015 UTC,"The first character I voted for when the polling opened. At first I thought it was completely implausible because Namco-Bandai already had Pac-Man as a representative, but with Capcom having Mega Man and Ryu, who knows?  Still not very likely, but I'd love to see it happen. The only downside I can see is that he'd probably have another transformation as his final smash, which I think are the most boring ones."
digimon,3b5x3h,Hector_Kur,2,Fri Jun 26 12:23:55 2015 UTC,"At first I thought it was completely implausible because Namco-Bandai already had Pac-Man as a representative   Even if each company was limited to one representation (which is possible, but I don't think proven, even before Ryu was announced), it could be argued that Pac-Man is the Namco representative and Agumon would be the Bandai representative. It's true they're the same company now, but each half has its own legacy that could be honored independently from the other."
digimon,3b5x3h,gallyguru,2,Fri Jun 26 14:34:54 2015 UTC,It was just an assumption I had from Sakurai going on record as not wanting to have too many third party characters.
digimon,3b5x3h,Hector_Kur,2,Fri Jun 26 15:52:28 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, then.  I think Agumon is unlikely either way, though. Not because of a limitation of third party characters, but because even in the West Digimon is rather obscure, and as I understand it's even more obscure in its home country these days. I want to be wrong, though!"
digimon,3b5x3h,Animedingo,6,Fri Jun 26 16:07:39 2015 UTC,"Ill be that guy and say I really dont want agumon for smash bros. Honestly that list of games they put up in their example has like two or three legitimately good titles. I dont even see agumon as a game character, hes more known for the anime.   Yes he has reskins, yes hes been in games but the digimon games arent really iconic in any way. If they were, they would be more popular internationally"
digimon,3b5x3h,Animedingo,6,Fri Jun 26 18:00:02 2015 UTC,"Humm , thats not a problem. We can vote vor anyone , and Agumon is my favorite!"
digimon,3b5x3h,Netkeeper,-3,Fri Jun 26 19:09:07 2015 UTC,"Sure we can vote for anyone, but I just feel there are characters more deserving than agumon to get into smash.   Also, realistically, he doesnt have that creative of a move set. Like, pepper breath and different claw attacks"
digimon,3b5x3h,Animedingo,3,Fri Jun 26 19:11:18 2015 UTC,ok.
digimon,3b5x3h,Sea-Salt,-5,Fri Jun 26 19:39:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed completely. Digimon is a toy franchise first and foremost, not a video game franchise. People that think any Digimon has a chance aren't looking at the facts.  Besides, I'd much rather see Wonder Red, Professor Layton, or Bayonetta. :V"
digimon,3b5x3h,JLinks22,2,Fri Jun 26 20:35:42 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, there are plenty of Nintendo franchises that deserve spots over non Nintendo ones.   Like, Isaac from Golden Sun or any of the ones you mentioned.   People can have any opinion they want but whenever I see one of these campaigns it just gets people's hopes up.   Honestly at this point Goku is more realistic than Agumon"
digimon,3b5x3h,CheapWisdomForSale,4,Fri Jun 26 20:56:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't see it happening. Digimon doesn't have nearly as much of a legacy as most of the franchises represented in Smash Bros. (and even the ones that don't, are usually ones that Nintendo is trying to promote).  Nintendo characters are the obvious inclusion. Sonic is there because he's both a lifelong rival to Mario in sales, and this is a showdown any kid of the 90s was dying to see. Snake and Megaman first started on the NES, with the former being practically begged by his creator to include, and the latter a classic character who deserves some love after his own company's hate of him.  Pac-man is a legend of gaming. You can ask anyone who he is, and 99.9% of the time they'll know. I think most people predicted his appearance upon learning of Namco's involvement with the game.  Ryu is the star of what is probably the first major fighting game. It doesn't matter that he's a second Capcom representative; Smash Bros. as it is might not exist were it not for him.  I mean, I love Agumon, but it's like a lot of other posts I've seen around, where people are wanting, for example, Sora from Kingdom Hearts. Smash Bros. is like a history lesson in classic gaming, and there's still so many other representatives that deserve a place in Smash before the new blood do."
digimon,3b5x3h,shadowpikachu,2,Fri Jun 26 19:44:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Voted for Agu anyway. The more votes Digimon gets the more it shows the companies that Digimon is recognized, so it's totally worth it."
digimon,3b5x3h,alvinchimp,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:52:25 2015 UTC,"I agree that, in the history of gaming that Agumon (along with Digimon as a franchise) doesn't really stand up compared to other possibilities.  However, Nintendo wouldn't be having this poll at all if it weren't for them looking for creative and unexpected entries for gaming characters.  Although we're a small community of American Digimon enthusiasts, we're still wildly enthusiastic- and maybe reaching out in this way will make Bandai put on their thinking caps and rethink their approach to localizing games in America.  That's all I can ask for.  Depending on future Digimon content, maybe that would start a snowball effect in the gaming community in general and spurr an eventual development of an Agumon character in Smash (wayyyyy down the road).  I know it's unlikely, but I don't think it's futile."
digimon,3b5x3h,josqpiercy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:46:51 2015 UTC,As far as i know digimon is more of a thing in japan then america.  The digivolution system can be VERY interesting with moves and skills changing from digivolving and degenerating.

digimon,3b90nz,MrRoboface,6,Fri Jun 26 23:19:30 2015 UTC,"Care for your Digimon? ;) Feeding and pooping in a Toilet increases Discipline. If that isn't enough for you, you might want to consider to use discipline raising food like Ice Mushrooms or certain types of fish.  If you have low discipline try to feed items (e.g. small recoveries) and hope that he denies them. If he does, scold you Digimon and you'll get a discipline boost without losing happiness.    Ofc you can try it with scolding but be warned, low happiness has a mayor effect on your lifetime. I can't tell you the threshold of ""allowed"" unhappiness, yet, but if I look at the values of DW1 you want 80%+ of Happiness to get the full lifetime of your Digimon. ;)"
digimon,3b90nz,SydMontague,2,Fri Jun 26 23:57:39 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks. I didn't realise there were types of food that raised discipline :D"
digimon,3b90nz,SydMontague,2,Sat Jun 27 00:19:29 2015 UTC,An additional warning due to my latest research: The happiness based lifetime redution is actually based on the ratio between Happiness and Discipline. -> high discipline will reduce your lifetime and even more when achieved through scolding. (max Discipline and min Happiness should half your lifetime effectivly)  Edit: Not a ratio but fix values depending on your Happiness and Discipline.
digimon,3b90nz,SydMontague,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:26:41 2015 UTC,"Since posting this I ended up with a new digimon, he's now a Growlmon with around 75% (50% through the second bar) discipline naturally, with full happiness. I guess this shouldn't have much of a downside?"
digimon,3b90nz,Ratchet613,2,Sat Jun 27 00:50:07 2015 UTC,"Well, if my research is correct you should lose about 5,5h of possible lifetime within 4h of ingame time. I don't know the life times, yet, but as I didn't didn't know them during my 100% playthough either where I still managed to get pretty old Digimon I guess you're fine. It's probably more a balance feature. ;)"
digimon,3b90nz,SydMontague,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:06:00 2015 UTC,So if you have Full Happiness and Discipline does that shorten your lifespan? Or is that a good ratio?
digimon,3b90nz,Ratchet613,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:49:12 2015 UTC,"(Short answer: it shortens you lifespan)  I dug deeper into it by now and hopefully understood the full system, so a small outline of it:  Every 4th hour (04:00, 08:00, and so on) the game will calculate the additional lifetime loss based on your current happiness and discipline. Unlike previously assumed it's not the ratio between those 2 but their absolute value that matter. There are 5 ranges in 0.5h steps that determine the lifetime loss from each value.  Down below the ranges and their effect I observed so far. Note that the value is actually a decimal number.  == Happiness Lifetime Reduction == 90 - 100 = 0h 65 - <90 = 0.5h 40 - <65 = 1h 15 - <39 = 1.5h  0 - <14 = 2h    == Discipline Lifetime Reduction == 0  - <15 = 0h 15 - <40 = 0.5h 40 - <65 = 1h 65 - <90 = 1.5h 90 - 100 = 2h    So with full happiness and discipline you should lose 6h worth of lifetime every 4h of ingame time giving you slightly less lifetime for a Ultimate(sub)/Mega Digimon as you had in DW1 with a Perfect/Ultimate(dub) Digimon under perfect conditions. (DW1 had almost the same system, that only accounted happiness, though)  PS: Please don't get too affected in the way you play the game due to my research. What I uncover are systems that normally are not directly visible to the player for a reason. The designers planned your experience with this system and it's not there to give you a disadvantage."
digimon,3b90nz,SydMontague,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:15:30 2015 UTC,Oh it won't effect my gameplay at all. I was just curious how that worked. How would you keep Discipline down though? Just by regular training and care his happiness and discipline max out.
digimon,3b90nz,pkmongoose,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:36:09 2015 UTC,Praising would increase happiness and decrease discipline.
digimon,3b90nz,ChronaMewX,2,Sat Jun 27 10:32:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you should only scold your Digimon after it refuses to take a bandage or other recovery item. This will be marked with a frowny face and will result in an increase in Discipline and no decrease in Happiness. Refusal with a scribble or NG means you can't use the item."

You need better battle commands like Moderate, Defend, and Move. Kind of complicated, so I wouldn't recommend including Muscle Charge in your move list. Just stick to your damage-dealing techs.  (2) This game necessitates that you become poor. You will spend all your cash buying meat and health items, and you will do it over and over and over. Well, at least in the early parts. By the time your digimon is strong and all grown-up, you could farm enemy digimon and earn money from them. Remember, your digimon is your investment so don't worry too much about buying it 10 pieces of meat a day Take good care of it and you shall soon profit.   (3) Do not spam training. This is something you need to think about carefully. Go read this Digivolution Guide. It'll help you decide which digivolutions you want and consequently which stats to increase.   Re:Digitize (like most Digimon games) isn't a beginner-friendly game. It is very technical, so you need to know what you're doing. Play it without guidance and you might end up with a Numemon. So just keep asking questions if you're confused about something."
digimon,3b7b1n,HastyCapablanca,2,Fri Jun 26 18:00:44 2015 UTC,"Training, Training and Techs grinding.  Get used to intermediate training and you should get Perfects/Ultimates(dub) and even Ultimates(sub)/Megas quite easy. For the early game it's not exactly required, but in the later game you want high level Digimon with good techs (Tier 5 and higher).    To learn techs, just fight a few Digimon that use the moves you can learn and you'll eventually learn something. If not, you at least get bits to buy meat. Also, find Palmon quickly to upgrade the meat field. ;)  Another usefull thing is fishing. You can either get a lot of money or at least some food from it."
digimon,3b7b1n,SydMontague,2,Fri Jun 26 16:40:10 2015 UTC,"Pretty much just grind like mad. Off increases your skills damage, def decreases damage you take, speed increases how quicjly you can attack again, and brains increases the commands you can give. Training brains also has a small chance to learn a new tech.   Do intermediate training. It's basically required in this game. You can save whenever you want so you can even savescum it if that's your jam.   If you're up for it do some tournament battles if you've recruited greymon. They don't take up any time in a day but you can get some really good items like meat and bandages. It's also the only way to unlock some digivolutions like Wargreymon and Lilkthmon.   Get Palmon asap. You can get him in the signpost forest pnce you have ~10 prosperity and will make the game a LOT easier. If you want you could also spend a digimons lifespan to gring offence up to 700 to get kudomon for dat daily sirloin.   Don't be discouraged. Thd game has a learning curve but once you get through your first few digimon it becomes pretty easy. Every time you get a mega your tamer rank goes up which increases the stats that get passed to your digimon upon rebirth. So once you get going it becomes a lot easier."
digimon,3b7b1n,NotAFgt,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:15:39 2015 UTC,"But if I grind a digimon up to 700 offence will it be okay for the next generation? I mean wouldn't it make the stats inherited much lower?   Also, what happens if a digimon has been incarnated several times with high stats and then dies in the rookie or champion level digivolution?"
digimon,3b7b1n,vanitas14,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:43:11 2015 UTC,"When you're first starting out you probably don't need to worry to much about inherited stats. The percentage inherited goes up with your tamer level, which goes up with evolving into Megas.   Also if your digimon dies in the rookie level you're doing something very wrong. I would suggest looking up some guides for the game and how to properly care for your digimon to avoid care mistakes."

Geogreymon cant use the first fire skill for some reason but do not despair! try and get another digimon  like guilmon for your second digimon in this game (after it dies, reborn it in a red digiegg) guilmon and its evolutions all use that fire skill, so no problem there XD.  In regards to your current situacion, u can try and get new techinques by figthing digimon, try figthing goburimons to get an area figthing skill and when you get to one of the story bosses (the purple ones, you will know wich ones XD), try and get your digimon to learn the fire area attack it uses, its great for all stages of the game (hits like a truck to all enemies in the map, but comes with high MP cost).

Now that it's finally out I was SO EXCITED to play the game and yet, here I am, playing Digimon World 2 because honestly I am disappointed in the game. Perhaps I should have read up on it, but I did not know about the -death- feature. Having to retrain your new Digimon only for it to die in 10 days is such a downer. (✖╭╮✖)"
digimon,3b1kac,Masterofknees,2,Thu Jun 25 06:34:13 2015 UTC,"The death mechanic is not much different from the DNA Digivolve mechanic in World 2 where your Digimon is thrown back to level 1 but with higher stats. Everytime your Digimon dies in Re:Digitize it'll carry over some of its stats, so training it and Digivolving it will be easier everytime it dies."
digimon,3b1kac,Scottybam,4,Thu Jun 25 06:55:12 2015 UTC,How is this different to the Egg thing in Digimon World 1? After x time or x deaths you die and get a replacement egg.
digimon,3b1kac,AyySL,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:04:25 2015 UTC,I was unaware of such a mechanic until about an hour ago. Don't know how long i'll be playing DW2 either now. lol.

In DW1, and I imagine Re: Digitize, the mechanic does get old but it was originally conceived as bringing more of  video game and RPG elements to the V-Pets.   In DW2 the higher digivolved your digimon, the higher they are when DNA digivolved. Ex: Ultimate+Ultimate= Champion. It helps it not take so long to retrain them. now if you go for Omnimon, Diaboramon, Imperialdramon, or Baihumon then you might get seriously bored of the mechanic unless you plan very much ahead"

digimon,3b1kac,vanitas14,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:26:12 2015 UTC,I didn't play those games but it's pretty annoying when all you want is a clear sweep trying to get a specific Digimon and they are busy pooping and dying on you. BUT with that comes the pride in actually getting it. I might revisit the game sometime.
digimon,3b1kac,vanitas14,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:28:56 2015 UTC,"The DS games are often compared to Pokemon so that should give you an idea. A lot of the mechanics irk me the wrong way the pooping, feeding, lack of actual control of the digimon, and the heavy emphasis on training over actual fighting. The way to digivolve is pretty cool tho its kinda cool but ya gotta do research to get what ya want. I get that it all becomes a more streamlined process once you get thru the main bulk of the game but i just can't find any of the mechanics fun."
digimon,3b3554,vanitas14,2,Thu Jun 25 16:14:02 2015 UTC,"Does your digimon have any ultimate-level (or at least champion-level) moves? Because even with a Darkdramon, if all you got in your arsenal is Sonic Punch or Spit Fire, then you really shouldn't expect easy battles at Fluorescent Cave. Digimon there tend to gang up on you (parties of two). So not only do you need a good-damaging move, but also one with a WIDE range (able to hit multiple enemies). I personally didn't find Fluorescent Cave that much of a problem since my Wargrowlmon had Fire Wall.   So in your case, it might be best to go look up the moves available to your Darkdramon, then find and farm the enemy digimon where you could learn these moves from. Sorry I'm not that familiar with your digimon's moveset, but I trust that's something you can google on your own."
digimon,3b3554,HastyCapablanca,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:30:24 2015 UTC,That's explains it. From time to time I've been hitting the gym and not the field so the moves my digimon learned are just tier 1 and 2 skills. Thank you so much on the tip about farming moves. It makes much more sense that I'm losing to rookie/champion level digimon.
digimon,3b3554,SydMontague,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:01:08 2015 UTC,"Learning moves should be easier by fighting Digimon - if you fight a Digimon that actually has a move you can learn - but getting stats is IMHO easier by using the Gym. Especially if you use Intermedate/Advanced training you gain a lot of stats quickly. To improve your training even more you can use Super Carrots/Hawk Raddish, the training Manual and especially the Baby Upgrade (train 10 times at a station with a Baby Digimon to upgrade it) and the restaurant (if you have the money).  About combat: if you have high brains, use your commands. A good timed guard command can reduce the damage taken up to 80% and a move command can bring you out of the attacks range.   As for Happiness and Discipline. If a guide uses + and - they probably mean the Yellow bar for + and Black for -."

digimon,3b3554,SydMontague,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:23:00 2015 UTC,You only have to upgrade it once per station and it's permanent.   This mechanic is btw. 1:1 copied from DW1. ;)

digimon,3b3554,Giulls,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:03:48 2015 UTC,"Training is by far more effective at giving you stats which are what matters most in the end. Moves can be learned from brains training (rarely though), or from fighting a digimon that uses a move you don't know but can learn so you can grind those digimon, just not as your sole training. You can actually train for most of the day, as long as you rest once or twice, avoiding the sweat drops prompt from your Digimon (rest before that happens!). Learning new techs does seem to be harder in this game though, since digimon tend to use less kinds of moves than in the original.  As for negative discipline, it's probably not worth it achieving that specific requirement, but praising your digimon lowers discipline and raises happiness so you can do that a ton. The bar changes when you go from -1 to -100 (at least this was the case in the original, I haven't actually gone to negative discipline in this one)."

digimon,3ay2nh,MrRoboface,4,Wed Jun 24 12:41:18 2015 UTC,"My theory (not backed up by data):  When you chose to pass some power to the next Digimon you get a statsboost based on your old stats and your Tamer level, as it was normal in DW1 (in DW1 it was 1% per level). While that sounds good, it can hinder you to achieve certain evolutions if you start with too high stats. Giving you the option to not get this statsboost therefore could allow you to get certain evolutions."

At first I thought that you could only have the digi memory if you declined to pass the traits along to the next digimon, but I was able to do both with mine.

digimon,3arcj4,ChronaMewX,10,Tue Jun 23 08:38:45 2015 UTC,I'm gonna play this game so fucking hard
digimon,3arcj4,Maloth_Warblade,6,Mon Jun 22 22:14:00 2015 UTC,Finally. Been following for years and am so glad its done. Time to break out the psp
digimon,3arcj4,thunderkid4,6,Mon Jun 22 23:00:52 2015 UTC,I feel bad for asking but how do I go about playing this? My roommate and I are big Digifans and would love to play this!
digimon,3arcj4,ArcticSwordofV,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:27:40 2015 UTC,What exactly are you having trouble with?
digimon,3arcj4,Fitnesslad50,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:32:43 2015 UTC,How do you run the patcher? What are the input and output iso's you have to put in?
digimon,3arcj4,ArcticSwordofV,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:19:57 2015 UTC,"The input is the Japanese ISO, the Output = click output and make a file name for it and choose the area where to put it as well."
digimon,3arcj4,thunderkid4,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:52:33 2015 UTC,Well I guess everything in general. Would I have to first emulate the game then apply a patch to it? Or is it all in a simple download?
digimon,3arcj4,ArcticSwordofV,2,Tue Jun 23 04:04:00 2015 UTC,"First you need the ISO of Digimon World Regiditize (Japanese version obviously)  Then you use the downloaded file (There should be a patch.exe or something when you extract it and open the folder), there is an input button, click it and choose the Japanese ISO. Then click output and I think it lets you name the new ISO and choose where to place it. Then run it on a PSP/PSP Emulator. And boom, Digimon for months"
digimon,3arcj4,Nopthebeast,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:06:41 2015 UTC,what if the patcher cant find the xdelta things even though they came with the patcher? idk how to use that patcher. im on ppsspp
digimon,3arcj4,ArcticSwordofV,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:46:56 2015 UTC,"The xdelta things should be in thesame folder as the patcher, did you move the patcher file or something?"
digimon,3arcj4,Nopthebeast,2,Tue Jun 23 07:03:57 2015 UTC,i got it now thanks. i dont know how i messed it up. now to learn controls
digimon,3arcj4,ArcticSwordofV,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:18:50 2015 UTC,"You can set the controls, though if you are using Windows I'm not quite sure how aha, should be at the menu at the top somewhere."

digimon,3arcj4,PopeJP22,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:18:52 2015 UTC,Where did you find a rom for the game on ppsspp?
digimon,3arcj4,Ratchet613,3,Thu Jun 25 01:46:36 2015 UTC,"So just to make sure I understand, you can download the patch and everything but the PSP hooks up to the computer somehow? Sorry i am literally PSP challenged (I never had it) but really wanted to play this game."
digimon,3arcj4,The_Mortician,3,Tue Jun 23 00:42:24 2015 UTC,If your PSP has the correct hacked firmware you can load it onto the memory card and play it from there.  You can also play it on your computer if you have a psp emulator installed.  Personally I'm using PPSSPP with a Dualshock 4 and it's working great.
digimon,3arcj4,deliciousdave33,3,Tue Jun 23 02:29:12 2015 UTC,i don't have anything that can connect a controller to my pc. is PPSSPP easy to use with just keyboard?
digimon,3arcj4,Vebrendos,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:45:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah!, its almost tje same as using a gba or snes or ps1 emulador"
digimon,3arcj4,The_Mortician,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:02:40 2015 UTC,"I've never used it with a keyboard, but I don't think it would be too terrible to use.  And just as a heads up, if you have a Xbox One controller, or a Dualshock 3/4 you don't need anything special to connect it to your PC.  You just plug it in with the USB charging cable and it should take care of drivers and such automatically."

digimon,3arcj4,The_Mortician,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:47:08 2015 UTC,"Ah, that sucks then.  They do make receivers that make wireless 360 controllers work, but at that point you're probably better off just buying a cheap $30 controller.  Less hassle that way."
digimon,3arcj4,upbeatoffbeat,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:51:00 2015 UTC,Do you know how to use this in an emulator?
digimon,3arcj4,ArcticSwordofV,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:37:20 2015 UTC,There should be (USB)cables that allow the PSP and the PC to connect.
digimon,3arcj4,ArcticSwordofV,7,Tue Jun 23 02:33:29 2015 UTC,"Okay, so how exactly do I run this patcher?  Edit: Oh snap I'm on a mac... Can any kind soul possibly give me a version of the ISO with the English patch up? Or is that not possible? How would one normally use this patch exactly?  Edit 2:... Well, I guess I'm gonna try to Bootcamp this. Will it make somethling like a new ISO?  Edit 3: It was surprisingly easy. Lets hope I did this right though.  Edit 4: It is happening!  Edit 5: Oh gosh, where is the potty area?!  Edit 6: Okay found it, now I need foood. My gosh I miss this.

digimon,3arcj4,ArcticSwordofV,2,Mon Jun 22 23:56:24 2015 UTC,You could have a friend do it for you! He just needs the ISO and the files downloaded. And he makes a NEW ISO which he can give to you!
digimon,3arcj4,HerculesKabuterimon,2,Mon Jun 22 23:58:06 2015 UTC,Hmm brilliant idea! I guess I'll have to do that.

digimon,3arcj4,adamr999,2,Tue Jun 23 05:49:23 2015 UTC,Oh wow it even has a sub or dub choice :D Looking forward to finally playing this. Huge thanks to the translation team if they happen to be reading this.
digimon,3arcj4,ArcticSwordofV,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:53:22 2015 UTC,Where was that?
digimon,3arcj4,adamr999,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:57:31 2015 UTC,When you use the patcher it gives you the choice before you apply it.
digimon,3arcj4,rundelhaus,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:07:07 2015 UTC,"Well it's actually the same as far as I can tell. The only difference is, with the ""Sub"" version of the patch, the game crashes on my PSP 3000 as soon as I enter my player's name. With the ""Dub"" option, it works fine on the PSP. And they're both Japanese voice with english subtitles."
digimon,3arcj4,TheGamer821,2,Tue Jun 23 04:58:29 2015 UTC,The difference ist that the sub versin will use the dukemon name while the dub version will reffer to it as gallantmon. Also attack names are optimized.
digimon,3arcj4,deliciousdave33,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:59:26 2015 UTC,that's a really cool option. Glad it's not a poor english voice actor job
digimon,3arcj4,Animedingo,-2,Tue Jun 23 06:48:18 2015 UTC,"That's actually not correct as far as I can tell. I believe it has to do with the region of your PSP or emulator. If it's Japanese you use the sub, if it's anywhere localized, it's the dub"
digimon,3arcj4,TheGamer821,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:12:07 2015 UTC,Whoever told you that either lied or didn't knew any better.

digimon,3arcj4,Animedingo,2,Tue Jun 23 00:42:59 2015 UTC,"Is anyone else having an issue where it crashes after the name entry?   Edit: Ok figured it out. If you're playing on a hacked psp, make sure you patch using the DUB option."
digimon,3arcj4,Existavail,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:08:26 2015 UTC,I guess it's a good thing I went with the Dub option. I've been playing that one for a while now no problems but I made two patched copies one for sub and one for dub just cause haha.
digimon,3arcj4,Prodime,2,Tue Jun 23 02:29:12 2015 UTC,is it possible to play this on PC? and if so...how?!
digimon,3arcj4,YoungCorruption,5,Tue Jun 23 03:05:45 2015 UTC,PPSSPP emulator or any psp emulator will work but PPSSPP is the best i believe

digimon,3arcj4,SydMontague,2,Tue Jun 23 07:10:09 2015 UTC,"Nice!  I'm amazed so far. The game is not only really good, it is actually quite a remake of the original Digimon World. I mean, I've spent the last months researching how DW1 worked and I'm able to use a lot of my knowledge in Re:Digitize already.  So a general tip for everyone: when you have a baby Digimon, train 10 times at the same station and you'll get a permanent training boost (20% from my observations so far) for all Digimon to come. I was able to train exactly 20 times with my baby Digimon, so you better keep counting. ;)  Damn, I didn't want to overanalyze this game, but it's tempting me. :S"

Memorize some numbers and their position (the bombs are helpful) and simply look for the only cube that matches Offense Training: Just timing - it's the same as the finisher so you better keep training. :P Defense Training: Reaction time. You need to press the button after the punch.  Speed Training: Reaction time and thinking. Relocate after every round to the middle to be able do dodge in all directions, I observed that the pair bombs seem to come from the direction the don't affect. Brain Training: Thinking. The game is called Ghost Leg or Amida-kuji (DW1 players might recognize this from Amida Forest). Simply go up from the exit and take every intersection, the number you end up is the number you have to press.    A way better bonus try mechanic than in DW1 (which was rigged)."

digimon,3asn9u,SydMontague,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:27:44 2015 UTC,"I can try.   You have 3 starts and 3 exits. Between a start and an exit exists one vertical line each and between these lines multiple horizontal lines can exist.  When traversing the ""maze"" you chose one start point and go down the vertical line. If you encounter a horizontal line you have to follow it until you eventually reach one of the 3 exits. Due to the nature of this ""maze"" it works in both directions the same way, allowing you to switch start and exit effectively reducing the complexity from checking 3 paths to only 1 path. -> You go up from the exit without bomb and take every horizontal intersection until you reach a start point.

digimon,3arn1x,theprojectprototype,3,Mon Jun 22 23:19:00 2015 UTC,War = bad for kids.  Or atleast parents being over protective of their kids and calling because of the war part.  Overall fusion seems to work better then cross for america.
digimon,3arn1x,shadowpikachu,2,Tue Jun 23 00:26:15 2015 UTC,Well to be honest Xros wars doesnt have much to do with a actual war but they still could've named it Xros Battles and everything would be fine.

digimon,3ao633,einsosen,4,Mon Jun 22 15:52:55 2015 UTC,"Generally anything more powerful than Mega would defy absolute categorization. There have been digimon at weird god-like stages, but they can't really be categorized for the same reason that a level 20 D&D wizard and level 20 fighter can't be balanced within one power rank. Beyond Mega, digimon can warp space, create new realities, and do things that break power ratings."
digimon,3ao633,windwalker13,3,Mon Jun 22 03:36:25 2015 UTC,I believe Imperialdramon Fighter mode is not a beyond mega level. It is just a mode change so that the powers can be used more effectively for fighting.
digimon,3ao633,Blazer25ace,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:14:40 2015 UTC,What about Omnimon. It's a fusion of two megas. Certainly it would be above mega level.

digimon,3ao633,SSJ5Gogetenks,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:29:42 2015 UTC,Still a Mega. Very powerful though.
digimon,3ao633,huzaifa96,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:12:33 2015 UTC,IPM is not that much better than OMG.  Koshiro says in ep 26 of 02 that WGmon and MetalGarurumon fused to create a mon 10 times them combined.  Imperialdramon FM>=WarGreymon. So their fusion is probably 10%+ above Omegamon alone.   Like Omegamon 1.12
digimon,3ao633,Animedingo,3,Tue Jun 23 19:30:38 2015 UTC,"Ok so Mega Digimon that have Mode Changes afterwards, like Gallantmon Crimson Mode, Beelzemon Blast Mode, shingreymon Burst mode, these are just Blast or Burst modes. They're not really a Super Ultimate.   Sometimes digimon have Side Megas, like Imperialdramon has Fighter Mode. It's not really stronger, but in certain situations it's just better.   Some Digimon actually do evolve past the Mega Level, these are ones like Susannoomon, Armageddonmon, and I personally believe Omnimon is a super ultimate because he's the jogress of 2 megas, basically making him a double mega."
digimon,3ao633,huzaifa96,0,Tue Jun 23 17:43:59 2015 UTC,"Omegamon is not a Jogress of WGmon and MGmon. Jogresses are basically akin to fusions in Yu-Gi-Oh!, where you get ~30% increase.   Omegamon is 10x WGmon or MGmon alone."
digimon,3ao633,Animedingo,0,Tue Jun 23 19:38:06 2015 UTC,"He absolutely IS a Jogress.   He was the first Jogres, they even referenced the movie where he formed in the anime when they were first discussing jogress!   Even if that was like, an american only translation, in every single game that he's appeared in, he's been a jogress of War greymon and Metal Garurumon"
digimon,3ao633,huzaifa96,0,Tue Jun 23 19:46:47 2015 UTC,"Hm...he's different from the concept of Jogress, but I suppose that is the only way to classify him.  Most fusions in Digimon give, say, a 30% stat boost rather than doubling or combining the two characters' stats.  The anime always shows it as simply Digi-volving using the other's data.  Being ""roughly"" the same character, but one stage ahead.  Like Imperialdramon isn't ExVee+Sting. It's more like ExVee EVOLVE (Sting-type) to Ultimate.  Whereas Omegamon is (WarGrey+MetalGaru)*5"
digimon,3ao633,Animedingo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:34:21 2015 UTC,"What are you even talking about, you're making up random figures to try and prove your point, they have never once, ONCE, given numerical figures for power levels in Digimon, outside of the level system.   Obviously 2 Champions Jogressing into an ultimate would be weaker than 2 Megas Jogressing into what rivals a super ultimate"
digimon,3ao633,huzaifa96,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:42:41 2015 UTC,"Koshiro says in episode 26 of 02 that WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon created a being 10 times stronger than either of them alone. Those two are average megas, and from what we have seen, the 02 partners are average as well.   IP Fighter mode is a jogress of 2 and is close to WarGreymon in power.  Shakkoumon and Silphymon are not much better than the Ultimate-level enemies, either.  Paladin Mode (due to OMGmon) and Stingmon to a lesser extent are standouts."
digimon,3ao633,TehTurk,2,Tue Jun 23 22:56:58 2015 UTC,"Iirc correctly there is no canon grouping or organization, but the digimon games have kinda helped over explaining certain aspects of the world/s as to why there are stronger megas. But also these guys have kinda grouped digimon and made it really easy! http://dma.wtw-x.net/  Currently there are around 4 levels of Mega, most digimon when they hit mega form are just a base Mega 4. Anything higher means they tend to have a certain title or responsibility to the digital world as a whole. olympians, royal knights, daemon lords, or great angels. Now what makes a run of the mill digimon say guilmon become a royal knight? He doesn't. When he hits mega level, He's a Mega Lvl IV. How does he become Mega Level 2 or 1 royal knight? Idfk be nice if there was a way."
digimon,3ao633,HeroOfTheSong,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:13:18 2015 UTC,Where does this 4 levels of mega thing come from.
digimon,3ao633,TehTurk,2,Mon Jun 22 18:01:20 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to remember and find where the concept came from. But I'm running blanks. Might have just categorized them myself as a way to understand it. It may have come majorly from the games. But what I do remember is basically both the English and Japanese levels have different naming schemes but the Japanese one make more sense as you go up (American name alongside). It's Baby 1(Fresh), Baby 2(In-Training), Child(Rookie), Adult(Champion), Perfect(Ultimate), Ultimate(Mega IV), Super Ultimate(Mega III), Then Mega II and I, I left these without a name because there are far and few digimon which are actually at these levels, and usually they have some special event or moment happening that makes them stronger. Ancient Digivolve, Or a Jogress x2 or x3. This also makes sense where you have mode changes, or armor changes or w/e and they seem stronger, just means they went up to the next Mega Level."
digimon,3ao633,josephdean21,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:53:52 2015 UTC,Mega 4 would be Mega IV. Roman numeral VI is 6.

digimon,3ao633,Zyr47,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:27:45 2015 UTC,"You're either seeing a Slide Evolution (in which one form becomes another digimon of equal level. Ie: Mega to Mega ""Mode"", or Champion to Armor Digi)  Or you're seeing a Digimon that is so powerful, like einsosen said, that it cannot be catagorized as a level and so is stuck with the closest thing to its current form. Imperaldramon Fighter Mode is this latter version. It's a power gain but doesn't follow the rules of normal Digimon. At a guess I'd say something like Omni/Omega mon follows these non-rule rules since it's power is exponentially higher than two separate Megas."
digimon,3ao633,Crossfiyah,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:10:23 2015 UTC,I really hate the name Super Ultimate.  We should call it Giga if anything.

digimon,3ao633,AuraXmaster,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:37:54 2015 UTC,I know people say they don't exist but I think mega sea dramon should be considered a gigantic level
digimon,3ao633,shadowpikachu,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:44:52 2015 UTC,"Theoretically there are limitless levels, it just is named and generally known up to mega.  Burst and fusion that should have their own line names, IMO.  In DW1 there was only ultimates but they had what is now considered megas.  Either no one knew of ulti line or natural evolution bumped the most suitable combat form up so that, once reached, will be better then before.  One day Super Ultimate (or Giga) will be the accepted highest level and within the world itself, not the media we get, will just keep going and going.  If Giga becomes an established thing, the human mind will know it is possible and will allow digidestined/tamers/chosen ones to reach it without a near death experience for the whole world.  But we can all rest knowing King Etemon is one of the first to get there.  GG"

digimon,3air3q,ydoccian,2,Sun Jun 21 04:20:11 2015 UTC,"I played 2 and my only thought on the game was that it was nothing like raising a Digimon.  The first one actually felt like I was inside the Digivice. It was an expansion of it that I could immerse myself in. At 7 years old, that was the fucking bomb. My first 20 or so died before they became Champions because I thought fighting was the best way to level up. (I played Pokémon first, okay?) Many of them literally became poop. I wasn't too focused on the story because I was never really strong enough to venture out.  Then, after about a month of playing this game, my Agumon became a Meramon. Holy. Fucking. Shit. I have a fucking flame monster following me around and burning shit to death. There's something so... magical about raising this creature that goes from a little blob to a kickass fire monster.   Every time my Digimon gets stronger, it's directly because of me. I took that little Koromon to the gym. I made him go poopy in the toilet. I fed him meat and mushrooms every day.  Then my mom bought me Digimon World 2. I was so excited to raise more awesome Digimon like Armadillomon. I started playing. It seemed like everything I loved so much about the first one was... lost in translation.  I get that some people weren't into the whole raising part, but for me that's what made it so great. It felt like I had a magical digital pet on the other side of my Playstation. It was a kind of immersion that most games didn't offer.  DW 2 and 3 were basically RPGs that didn't give me that same feeling. My friends called Digimon ""ripoff pokemon"" at that point, and I honestly couldn't argue with them. That's what it became in my eyes.  I could honestly go full Egoraptor and make a Sequelitis out of this. I don't think he'd be too keen on me doing that, though."

It's even classed as a reptile digimon.  In fact, we know exactly why it wears the pelt, because it's been written down. Gabumon are shy and timid, and wearing the pelt of a Garurumon (a fierce predator), makes it feel strong and gives it courage, the way a human wearing a lion skin would be considered an impressive hunter.

digimon,3akv08,likeagrapefruit,9,Sun Jun 21 17:41:36 2015 UTC,"As to why Gabumon evolves into Garurumon, it's very common for Digimon to undergo big changes as they evolve.

digimon,3agn05,MisterMadness,5,Sat Jun 20 00:16:07 2015 UTC,How about a Raider Raidramon?
digimon,3agn05,thisisanawesomename,-3,Sat Jun 20 03:52:53 2015 UTC,"That sounds a little silly, there's not much raider attire or whatnot that can be placed on Raidramon that can clearly indicate that he's a raider. Besides, why would you want Raidramon to be a raider other than for the sheer sake of petty alliteration? He's basically a mount that's more comparable to a Chryslus Highwayman or Vertibird.  But then again, that's my vision for the project. As for actually doing a Vault-Tec-style Raidramon, I'm really not sure. My plans are really more focused on drawing artwork for just Vee-Boy (and friends).  ADDENDUM: It is definitely possible to give the Raidramon a raider aesthetic, by adding skulls to his spikes and giving him a bunch of carry bags on his flanks alongside a great big ""Great Khans"" banner to go with it. However, at the moment such a concept isn't very attractive to me."

digimon,3a7k65,TweetPoster,2,Wed Jun 17 21:11:07 2015 UTC,Dubbed only? No subbed?
digimon,3a7k65,Smallkittenfeet,12,Wed Jun 17 23:44:10 2015 UTC,The dub is apart of the charm 😊
digimon,3a7k65,wisesonAC,-5,Thu Jun 18 06:13:22 2015 UTC,"Eh not really, it gets annoying hearing pun after pun after pun, during inappropriate times because dubs back then thought people were stupid."
digimon,3a7k65,Smallkittenfeet,-1,Thu Jun 18 06:57:00 2015 UTC,We think your stupid now :)
digimon,3a7k65,FTZulu,-4,Thu Jun 18 16:38:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the downvotes by the way, they are tasty. Anyway, so if I am ""stupid"" because I don't enjoy pun after pun after pun and you do..... Doesn't that make you retarded?"
digimon,3a7k65,Smallkittenfeet,5,Thu Jun 18 18:12:52 2015 UTC,Yes when people like things you don't like that makes them retarded.
digimon,3a7k65,FTZulu,-2,Thu Jun 18 19:02:33 2015 UTC,"Same could be said with you saying I am ""stupid"" for not liking pun after pun."
digimon,3a7k65,Smallkittenfeet,5,Thu Jun 18 21:30:53 2015 UTC,You sure take your kid shows seriously.
digimon,3a7k65,IncogM,-5,Fri Jun 19 01:14:57 2015 UTC,"Ok, whatever you say. I just realize that even though the show is my childhood, the dubbing in it was terrible and ruined the show in various means. After watching the true version of the show, it is very hard to go back and watch a show where it is more puns than dialog."
digimon,3a7k65,Smallkittenfeet,2,Fri Jun 19 01:16:24 2015 UTC,"I watched the subbed version. Beyond censoring the deaths of the black teddy + those pair by Myotismon, the fight between T.K and Matt in File Island, and the naked scene in the bathroom again on File Island... I have seen no change that significantly bothered me.  And I just ignore the aforementioned / insert the appropriate scene in my head."
digimon,3a7k65,frosthowler,-2,Sun Jun 21 13:07:33 2015 UTC,CR's subs are pretty garbage anyways.
digimon,3a7k65,TheDWGM,13,Thu Jun 18 01:29:58 2015 UTC,"But you know, at least they're official and make some money for the creators"
digimon,3a7k65,Fexmeif,2,Thu Jun 18 02:53:14 2015 UTC,This makes me soooo happy! :D

digimon,3a7k65,AkumaYoru,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:17:21 2015 UTC,Netflix has 1-3 subbed.
digimon,3a7k65,Smallkittenfeet,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:16:25 2015 UTC,...Isn't Crunchyroll a sushi?
digimon,3a7k65,Hector_Kur,3,Thu Jun 18 17:54:38 2015 UTC,how am I supposed to watch a anime on a sushi?!
digimon,3a6la3,Presenex,8,Wed Jun 17 17:05:55 2015 UTC,"Doesn't surprise me one bit. I bought a Vita for this game. Guys (and Gals), if you think about picking up a PS4 because of this game, do it. You won't be disappointed."
digimon,3a6la3,TheGamer821,2,Wed Jun 17 17:46:14 2015 UTC,From what I an tell this game is a lot like Pokemon and Digimon world 3? Is that true?
digimon,3a6la3,ElModeloEnPace,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:14:06 2015 UTC,"Play the Digimon World DS games to get a better idea of what this game is since same game series, the Digimon Story Series."
digimon,3a6la3,TheGamer821,7,Wed Jun 17 21:23:23 2015 UTC,as if I needed further reason to make me buy a PS4 after this e3
digimon,3a6la3,biggest_dreamer,2,Wed Jun 17 17:53:31 2015 UTC,Right? This and Horizon might be all the incentive I need.
digimon,3a6la3,ElModeloEnPace,4,Wed Jun 17 21:08:56 2015 UTC,"prays for vita compatabillity because is just a very poor uni student and ps4s are fucking expensive  EDIT, grammer fix because phones are silly"
digimon,3a6la3,Sagotomi,3,Thu Jun 18 09:02:32 2015 UTC,What about those with the 3DS. Decode needs to be localized!
digimon,3a6la3,PokemonGeek,4,Fri Jun 19 04:21:14 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to sound entitled or ungrateful,  because if this is a real thing,  I'd be more than happy this is coming over... but I'm not a fan of this releasing handheld titles as console games business.  Especially if there isn't even the alternative of at least a downloadable version for the system it was originally on."
digimon,3a6la3,dotyawning,2,Wed Jun 17 17:49:39 2015 UTC,"YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS! It would seem they think we westerners are more into PS4 than Vita, which is true. I can cross my fingers for cross-buy."

digimon,3a6la3,Kheartz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:09:59 2015 UTC,"If they translate it I will get a PS4. I would do that them,  as I need at least 3 games to get a console and the non exclusivity of FFVII, XV and KHIII excludes those"

digimon,3a6la3,Kiritaku,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:29:24 2015 UTC,OH MY!!!!! IM BUYING PS4 NOW.
digimon,3a6la3,mrsammysam,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:55:44 2015 UTC,"Not sure if the name digimon world was a typo or intentional, if it is intentional it could mean more than a simple port, they might add a lot more elements to the original game, much like the persona 4g port. Which could be why it is released at the end of next year, a simple port should not take that long. If this is the case, I'm glad it is coming to ps4 so I can enjoy extra content and better graphics, even though I bought a vita for it"
digimon,3a6la3,EqualityConsecrate,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:29:46 2015 UTC,"Not familiar with the Persona series, but I'm thinking that it's going to happen the same way with the Digimon Story games that were released in Japan on the DS (Sunburst and Moonlight). When they came to the west, they were renamed as Digimon World (Dawn and Dusk). I would love to have a Digimon game with a full cast of actual English voice actors (I believe it'll be the franchise's first if they decide to go that route)."
digimon,3a6la3,Kheartz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:38:44 2015 UTC,"Aw yisss...   If the platform's a mistake and it's actually just a Vita localisation, I'll be stealing my little brother's Vita. Either way, I'm set. :D"
digimon,3a6la3,hyperstorm,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:59:43 2015 UTC,It's a good thing I know French in case the game is only released in French

digimon,3a6la3,cheeseisntdairy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:47:19 2015 UTC,"PS4 is great. Wish it was coming over on Vita still, but if this is true and we'll get it in the west on PS4 that's still great."

digimon,3a6la3,White_Otaku,2,Thu Jun 25 05:02:46 2015 UTC,"went 404 earlier today, But so did Final Fantasy 7. I talked to someone who said they sent an email to find out what is going on."
digimon,3a6la3,Romiress,2,Thu Jun 25 05:09:25 2015 UTC,Can't tell if I should be saying 'please no' or 'please yes'.
digimon,3a6la3,Roku-ro,5,Wed Jun 17 17:15:16 2015 UTC,"Why on earth would anyone say ""no""?"
digimon,3a6la3,Romiress,5,Wed Jun 17 20:05:10 2015 UTC,"Well, originally this was on the vita. If it does come over as a PS4 exclusive, it's both a victory (digimon in north america!) and a huge slap in the face (we can't get even one vita game?!)"
digimon,3a6la3,Roku-ro,4,Wed Jun 17 20:41:44 2015 UTC,"Oh, you mean if it comes out in the west but only on PS4. Yeah, that would be pretty bad D:"
digimon,3a6la3,Romiress,6,Wed Jun 17 21:21:05 2015 UTC,I'm hopeful we're getting both - PS4 and vita. Or at least vita digital version.
digimon,3a6la3,user2338,2,Wed Jun 17 21:27:29 2015 UTC,I hope it would come out for the xbox one also I don't have the money to get a ps4
digimon,3a8rtf,lokilullaby,3,Thu Jun 18 03:11:40 2015 UTC,There are 2 that i know of that are done and are in testing stage.  They should be done in a few months if that.  There is a Redigitize fantranslation here.  There is a Lost Evolution fantranslation here  These have been going on for multiple years and this is the final stretch.
digimon,3a8rtf,shadowpikachu,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:31:07 2015 UTC,That 98% really making me go crazy for redigitize
digimon,3a8rtf,ArcticSwordofV,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:50:09 2015 UTC,They said it was done and all they have to do is put text in and check it out.  It will be done by end of summer is my guess.
digimon,3a8rtf,shadowpikachu,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:14:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah! Odds are they may have to change a few things but regardless, it should be by this year atleast. I can't wait!"
digimon,3a8rtf,ArcticSwordofV,-2,Fri Jun 19 16:20:19 2015 UTC,"Kingdom hearts 2 final mix is an amazing Japan-only ps2 game. A few years ago someone managed to replace about 99% of its text with English and put the ISO online for play on a ps2 emulator. Also, all the voice work was already in English.  Of course since then the HD remake has come to consoles in the states, so this isn't the only way to play this glorious title."

digimon,3a9ea9,dorkski1,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:17:04 2015 UTC,Unfortunately the Australian version of Netflix doesn't have any other seasons of digimon. Maybe in the future they'll add them but only time will tell.

digimon,39s8hs,Ratchet613,4,Sun Jun 14 06:41:10 2015 UTC,"The problem with almost all Digimon World guides I've seen so far is, that most of them are incomplete, flawed or simply wrong. From my experience this also includes printed, official guides to a certain extend.  These guides will probably help you anyways to play through the game.  But before you pay real money for a flawed guide, you could use one of the online and free flawed guides. This one should help you to play the game, but beware it's no exception to the rule. It contains many mistakes and wrong claims. Use it as a guide, not as the inerrant book of truth.  For evolutions I recommend This Guide. It's values are directly taken from game assets and have proven themselfs in many tests. It also basiclally explains how the evolution system works, but not in a complete manner though. (The first link used this values as well, I think)  If you are unsure about certain information or want to know something about more certain systems I'd simply recommend you to ask me. I've spent a lot of time within the last weeks/months to learn how this game works by not only observing what the player sees, but also by observing (and changing) the game memory itself. Watching Speedruns is also a good way to learn a lot about the game. Speedrun routes require insight in certain game mechanics and while they're not as deep as I go, they're easier applicable for a ""normal"" player, as they simply show you how to beat the game."
digimon,39s8hs,SydMontague,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:18:04 2015 UTC,"Funny that you mention the speedrunning because I actually did just that. I learned alot about the game in general that I never even knew when I played as a kid. It is unfortunate to hear the guides are somewhat flawed but I thank you for the links, they will definitely be put to good use."
digimon,39s8hs,longrodvonhuttendong,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:29:11 2015 UTC,I took it out from my library a couple years ago and from what I can remember it seemed to hit the points well. I used it mainly for a digivolving guide and to check some of the early areas for whatever.
digimon,39s8hs,bobdisgea,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:52:43 2015 UTC,I had all 3 games and the guides as a kid. One of them has a lot of wrong information on digivolutions and I think it was the first.

digimon,39oic4,Jamesathan,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:06:16 2015 UTC,I'm a big fan of this game myself. Been daydreaming for the longest if there is a way to convert this to an actual competitive two player paper card game. What do you think?
digimon,39oic4,bradon_,2,Mon Jun 15 20:58:13 2015 UTC,"Only problem would be all the damage buffs and calculations would have to be done on paper or something. Seems like a lot of handywork. Too much for people to want to play it, when you consider how simple and easy card games are being made now. I would be totally down for it though :D"
digimon,39oic4,Jamesathan,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:37:31 2015 UTC,Remember the damage calculator from Digimon Tamers? A device of that sort could be used to display damages and health of digimons.

I figured I could just round everything to be even numbers to make life easier, but you still have to take count of everything on paper.  As much as I love paper card games I think this one would port over pretty well to mobile. A program could handle everything fine."
digimon,39oic4,bradon_,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:32:00 2015 UTC,I would say either the first version or the last version to come out are the best options and will actually provide more fun and strategy.

I'm crossing my fingers that a) The new Butter-fly is heard or performed and the new I wish b) the PV is a long PV c) And new cast announcements that will make us want to run around and scream happily and speculate on the plot further.  Wasn't there a poster and some goodies given out at last year's Odaiba Memorial event? Could be the same for this one, maybe?

You use Scan Data and when it reaches 100% you can digitize them or something through the lab. Going above 100% increases the stats but honestly, with degeneration being a thing, there isn't really a point in waiting to get a 999% Scan Data (Though that is what I did with my Veemon rofl)"

digimon,39nxuw,Shivin302,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:19:25 2015 UTC,"Thing is, from what I've read, late game is all about moves or traits. So you may have to train stuff you don't like just so that you can get their moves and use Slide digivolution (From what I understand, you DNA something to lets say, Omnimon. Get the moves you want from Omnimons line, then regress it to Metalgarurumon who you then find someone else to DNA with to get a different digimon or even regress it further and find something for WereGarurumon to DNA with, etc).  As of now my team is Magnamon, Dianamon, MetalGarurumon. I obviously need to get rid of Dianamon though as it seems like a dead end (I don't think your starter can really DNA with anything... rofl). I'm planning to make Metal Garurumon an Omnimon and see who I like better, but I'm really digging Metal Garurus innate move as it makes farming a breeze. I might try out Alphamon or something for the 3rd slot or perhaps Gallantmon Crimson mode"
digimon,39nxuw,shadowpikachu,2,Sat Jun 13 16:53:53 2015 UTC,"I just got through a long run. My main trio were Metalgarurumon, Miragegaogamon and Wargreymon. Mgarurumon has that brutal 5 slot attack that helps out grinding. Miragegaogamon's ultimate form also has a 5 slot attack.  It's annoying to gain levels, but not a bad game overall.  Tl;dr: 5 slot attacks are a godsend"
digimon,39nxuw,RikkuEcRud,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:44:59 2015 UTC,"My only advice is be prepared to GRIND. It took me almost three days to get every single digimon to aptitude 99 and stats in the 900s. Abuse degenerate function as it allows you to easily gain stats. Try to do some digi egg matching to get a chibomon as well, otherwise stick with your three starters.  I finished the game with Metal Garurumon, War Greymon, Machinedramon, Dianamon, Kimeramon, and Imperialdramon. To beat Gaia Origin, I used Omnimon, ShineGreymon Burst mode, Machinedramon, Dianamon, Milleniummon, and Imperialdramon Fighter mode. Training these guys was a chore, luckily Transfield is a great place to farm. Late game in Magnet Mine, you can fight Armaggedonmon, which give tons of exp but are incredibly hard to take down, even with Imperialdramon Paladin Mode, ShineGreymon Burst Mode and MirageGaogamon Burst mode."
digimon,39nxuw,xpoz,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:32:35 2015 UTC,This isnt required if you have a general plan with your team.  For the main game you can go through with a reasonable amount of degenerations and levels.
digimon,39nxuw,Shaved_Almonds,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:58:01 2015 UTC,"Whenever I'm in the city I go to my farm and convert everything I have %100+ scan data for and replace the first character of their name with a 'Z' to both mark them as junk and keep stuff I intend to keep separate.  Then any time I evolve, degenerate or convert something I intend to use(or I just happen to be in the city with something still low enough to DNA with a level 1) I sacrifice them all to ""Aptitude Digivolve"" said Digimon.  Aptitude Digivolving is where you DNA Digivolve things that don't make a new Digimon for the stat changes. To explain, if you DNA Digivolve two things that don't make something new, like say your Dianamon and an Agumon, the result will be the first Digimon with slightly altered stats. So if you use Dianamon then Agumon you'll get a Dianamon with different stats.  The stat changes can be(from memory, might not be perfectly accurate):  commonly: +70/7/0(HPMP/stats/Aptitude)  uncommonly: -10/1/0(HPMP/stats/Aptitude)  rarely: +120/12/1(HPMP/stats/Aptitude)  very rarely: -30/3/0(HPMP/stats/Aptitude)  It can change resistances too, but I haven't really looked into that yet. In the first Digimon World DS resistances reset to an evolutions default every time you evolve/degenerate and I assumed that remained the case. The goal was to get the moves I want onto the evolution I want, with high enough stats to get reasonably close to 9999/999 by level 99 without ridiculous abuse of farm goods and then raise their resistances. Also, supposedly Farm goods training can only bring your resistances to 999 but Aptitude Digivolving can bring them to 1100, but again, that's something I don't have personal experience with.  I also like to plan out what Digimon and moves I want on my team and try to plan out the shortest route to get there, makes it a lot faster and easier to do get there if you know where you're going."
digimon,39nxuw,zsmg,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:57:11 2015 UTC,"don't be afraid to digivolve and degenerate to and from various different digimon. i scanned a lopmon at some point, digivolved it up through blackmegagargomon, and more recently brought it back down to lopmon and then all the way up to cherubimon (evil). i can't even remember what most of my main team originally was.  when you go on a new quest, look at the most common types in that area and then look ahead at the digivolution requirements for various digimon you've scanned (HOL 3000, etc.). keep one or two digimon in your backup 3 that need the kinds of experience that are easiest to get in that area. you may as well be grinding as long as you're running errands for strangers.  also, when it comes time for the gaia origin quest after the main storyline, stay humble and don't dive right into it. train and train and train and buy a lot of healing things. for reference, i currently have a lv 56 dotmiragegaogamon, a lv 72 shinegreymon, and a lv 63 ladydevimon (formerly lilithmon, but i'm trying to max out the aptitude) in my main 3 slots, and they all have stats in the 500s to 600s. i really struggled against GO."
digimon,39mw2f,TheMrPantsTaco,4,Fri Jun 12 21:39:03 2015 UTC,"In the original, the third movie is not canon. In the English dub, they treat it as though it is."
digimon,39mw2f,likeagrapefruit,4,Sat Jun 13 16:29:23 2015 UTC,"Hurricane Touchdown, I believe it's non-canon. Someone can correct me on this, but IIRC, the line referring to Willis at the end of Our War Game, is not in the Japanese dub."
digimon,39mw2f,MasterInterface,5,Sun Jun 14 03:49:37 2015 UTC,"Okay, fine point here: the third movie is not necessarily ""non-canon"" in the original, it's just extremely -weird- and -irrelevant- to the rest of the series. Wallace -does- appear in a later CD Drama (The Door to Summer), so he's at least a recognized character. In addition, the movie is listed within some official timelines that have been given in the memorial books (IIRC) - these are very obscure, though, and don't always have the ""story approval"" of anyone more than an overworked ghostwriter, so whether you accept them at face value or not is up to you.  Then, there's the discussion of what it -means- to be canon or not. The material explicitly points out the existence of alternate timelines, and we have frequent crossover events to substantiate that -- the Taichi in V-Tamer 01 is from a different timeline than the one in Adventure, yet Daisuke is able to meet the V-Tamer Taichi. Then, we have the manga for Xros Wars, which is absolutely incompatible continuity-wise with the anime, yet has a character witnessing the events of the anime as he passes outside of space and time. So there's definitely precedent for ""any plot that is truly contradictory simply happened in another timeline"" -- and the events of the movie fit with the Adventure 02 anime about as well as anything in that anime did. It's definitely possible to make up retcon explanations for the weirdness, and even if Toei eventually outright says ""the movie is absolutely not in continuity with the entire anime"", you could easily consider it a splinter timeline.  In the English dub (which is a separate continuity!), however, they take pains to establish it as in-continuity with the anime."
digimon,39mw2f,KrytenKoro,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:32:50 2015 UTC,"Great, detailed answer! So is like writers/whoever decides these things said ""Sure, we can make it official, it's not like it will come up anyway"" and before they announced Digimon Tri, that world's story was really finished.   The material explicitly points out the existence of alternate timelines, and we have frequent crossover events to substantiate that   I haven't played the Ryo games, but from what I understood, we also have time travelling and direct manipulation of those timelines. That resulted in the Ryo cameo and part of the Ken backstory, but otherwise didn't really affected much of anything in the Digimon Adventure world*.  *Or actually it did, but in some obscure ways.   and the events of the movie fit with the Adventure 02 anime about as well as anything in that anime did.   So, sort of, if we hit it a bit with a shovel to iron out the plot holes and inconsistencies :)"
digimon,39mw2f,aDigifanmon,3,Wed Jun 17 00:58:42 2015 UTC,"It's not clear if it's canon, but it's probably not. It's never referenced, and it's generally considered not to be part of the canon.  The first two parts are definitely canon. All signs point to Hurricane Touchdown not being canon."
digimon,39mw2f,Romiress,3,Fri Jun 12 21:47:47 2015 UTC,"Some of this depends on your definition of canon.  In the Japanese films, that third one is non-canon.  None of the references to Willis in the second movie or 02 happen.  The fact that the dub goes out of its way to tie it all together and add those references would imply it is canon in the dub."
digimon,39mw2f,AKluthe,2,Sun Jun 14 07:20:54 2015 UTC,in the world tour part of adventure 2 they say something about him and Davis seems to know who he is so to me it is all cannon and i count Willis as the 9 original chosen child becuse he got his digivice the same time tai and kari met there first digimon
digimon,39mw2f,lemontoast_,3,Sat Jun 13 12:59:20 2015 UTC,"Original 10 kids. Ken is also part of the originals because he got a digivice around the same time, bearded the power of the crest of kindness, and flashbacks from 02 hint that he met wormon(sp?) for the first time shortly after the events of Adventure when he helped Ryo defeat Milleniumon."
digimon,39mw2f,DaoFAQ,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:22:35 2015 UTC,"Well, if we go by the number of digi-eggs and what is told in the vision that the weird possessed Hikari showed, they are actually 8. If we go by the start of the Adventure season, the prophecy only mentions 7 chosen children, so there's plenty of room to discuss things. I might be wrong, but despite the fact Ryo didn't get it's own digimon and digivice until Tamers (I think), he still did a lot of things, so he can be considered an original digidestined? So we have 11 now?"
digimon,39mw2f,aDigifanmon,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:11:39 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, Ryo did indeed not get a digivice and partner until Tamers but the only way for me to reconcile that Ryo met the Adventure Gang AND was a Tamer is those are two different Ryo from alternate dimensions (as I assumed each separate continuity is an alternate timeline/universe). Therefore Ryo is not a Destined but is a Tamer.  While there are actually 11 Digi-eggs, unless you meant the actual eggs and not the Armors. It would still only be 10 (again, unless you meant actual eggs that the partners hatched from), the Digi-Egg of Miracles was forged as a one-use-miracle-item/Deus Ex Machina from the corrupted Crest of Kindness by the Sovereigns/Harmonious Ones to help beat the Emperor. After the fight, it reverted back to the Crest Form and Davis can't call on it like the other Armors he has. It's kind of like Goku's Super Spirit Bomb or like Super Saiyan God, it requires an incredible amount of power that's contributed by multiple people to create it. It's also like Exodia, using it will allow you to pull off a miracle win even if there's little chance of it happening otherwise.  That being said, assuming that the Digi-Egg of Destiny is canon along with Willis and that he did have semi-official Destined status, there would maybe be a Crest of Destiny out there somewhere that may or not be meant to be borne by Willis. If all of this paragraph is true then there are again only 10."

(maybe very broad and general base ideas to be heavily expanded on)  Good luck.  edit: oh my god i just remembered degeneration is a thing and that will make things very interesting past early game, imagine having your carry give up a 5~ levels of stats to degenerate  to get more then 5 levels + the digivolution stats again.  The power levels would spaz around and you would have to be a good player to keep track of what tricky stuff your opponents are getting in to.   The hardest thing to balance would be the level caps and digivolution lines.  It can be crazy where mid game you are an assassin but you take a different path and become a tank by mega level.  There are also some items that could give slight stat buffs like in the ds games. (not that much to where 1 item means you are crazy powerful because it should be based around evolution management)  You could also have type xp, so if you zone out someone they are forced into another digivolution line.  I can imagine this going BIG if executed right.  Also i may have idea dumped a bit there...  I would love to know the direction you are going so i could potentially help.  edit 2: imagine being a in training turning into a rookie where the enemy team cant see them and going to jungle or gank, i mean he could turn into any one of a few digimon with different rolls and paths themselves..."
digimon,39lgrw,shadowpikachu,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:01:14 2015 UTC,I'd play it. I'd even back it if there were a crowdfund with a feasible plan and business model.
digimon,39lgrw,Myxozoa,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:47:49 2015 UTC,IDK if crowdfunding would work because that would be making money from other's characters.  They might have a take down or worse.  Then again i don't know how that works or the creators stand on it.
digimon,39lgrw,shadowpikachu,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:00:20 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I have no idea how any of that stuff works. I know a lot of people on patreon use copyrighted characters without a problem, so I guess that falls under artistic domain or something, but kickstarter might be different."
digimon,39lgrw,Myxozoa,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:52:23 2015 UTC,Patreon is donating to someone individually.  Kickstarter is a project.

I tried to keep my expectations low but I kinda lucked out and found a D-ark too. Pop in some batteries and voila! Perfect working condition albeit some scratches and stripped paint.

digimon,38x88f,Callizero,10,Sun Jun 7 17:25:01 2015 UTC,At the time Digimon world 3 was to me the ultimate Digimon game I loved it. I didn't play Digimon world 2 untill Digimon world 4 was released and was disappointed in them both as I was expecting them to be like Digimon 1/3.  I enjoyed Digimon world championship but the de-generation thing was something that annoyed me. Digimon world ds and Dusk are really fun games abit grindy at the start and abit slow but once you get going it's easy to level just a shame I picked them up so late as I would have liked to play them online.  Kinda wish they would make a Digimon Battle 2 or something that game was legit haha.
digimon,38x88f,Theappleofsauce,2,Sun Jun 7 17:09:17 2015 UTC,There was a digimon battle 2 for the ps2.
digimon,38x88f,hoilori,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:51:58 2015 UTC,Which Digimon battle are you speaking of? Digimon battle online(Digimon rpg in asia) or something else?
digimon,38x88f,Theappleofsauce,2,Sun Jun 7 21:30:45 2015 UTC,"Woops, maybe you meant something else. I'm talking about digimon rumble arena"
digimon,38x88f,Goolashe,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:54:01 2015 UTC,As well as the GameCube and Xbox
digimon,38x88f,Purdy14,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:54:05 2015 UTC,"As much as I liked Digimon World 3, it was a game that you constantly had to go looking at a walk through to figure out where to go and what to do."
digimon,38x88f,Callizero,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:21:10 2015 UTC,Yes I agree (bearing in mind I was quite young when I played it) but I actually found it really difficult at the time considering I had pretty much breezed through every Final Fantasy at that point when I was like 10 years old. I found myself just having no direction on what I should be doing next.
digimon,38x88f,glurrrp,10,Mon Jun 8 13:50:01 2015 UTC,"I was a fan of Digimon rumble arena back in the day, always loved Digimon world 2"
digimon,38x88f,Lyrano,2,Sun Jun 7 17:25:31 2015 UTC,"Haha me and my little brother used to rent from this place called ""Tommy Ks"", Digimom Rumble  Arena all the time. Love that game"
digimon,38x88f,zaj209,5,Sun Jun 7 22:16:54 2015 UTC,"Digimon Dusk was amazing (the translation was wonky in regards to gender at times, though, and if forced they'll call you a boy, even though Sayo, the girl protagonist is Dusk's canological protagonist, and even if you use the girl protagonist, she's called a boy at times, even though she's pretty feminine looking? Also she's maybe a lesbian, or else the translation was wonky there, too- it's amazing, though- there's a Piedmon that's co-workers with a Lilymon. I wrote fanfic about them when I was younger) and to fully understand the plot of Adventures-Tamers, you have to play the Wonderswan games- only the remake (and they confusing, redundent, and quite frankly stupid way they handled it shows at least one way Pokemon was better- they remade both games [which, may I note, were basically identical], put them on the same cartridge, and named the remake after the most common Digimon you can get) of the first one was officially translated though.  Ajora on Tumblr has translated the script to most of the rest of them? She didn't, like, actually hack it into the game, though- I'd put her scripts into the games if I could, but I don't know of any text hacking programs for Wonderswan games.   Oh, and there's a Digimon fighting game for the PS3 and XBox 360? It's pretty fun, even if there's not even really much substance to it- Bandai's using it to judge the international market for Digimon, so it's a pretty good idea to buy it, even if you won't play it. I consider a fun game, even if it can be weird, or poorly thought out at times."

digimon,38x88f,AliasSigma,4,Wed Jun 10 05:35:44 2015 UTC,"Digimon world 2 is my favourite one! If you want to dial down the (nearly non-existent) repetition then you could run it on an emulator with 2x speed. It has an interesting dna-evolving style, where you combine 2 of your digimons to get both of their attacks, and higher maximum-level. I'm still trying to get that Omnimon! (Requires 20 dna-evolutions)  This site has very good and precise information about Digimon world 2: http://stage.metalkid.info/DigimonWorld2/Digipedia"
digimon,38x88f,hoilori,2,Sun Jun 7 21:29:15 2015 UTC,That's bro that's awesome! I'm thinking of maybe even let's playing these games so that guide would be great help!
digimon,38x88f,trev1776,3,Sun Jun 7 22:18:09 2015 UTC,"Also, Digimon World 2 even has cheats to turn off pretty much ALL of the unnecessary grind. The game becomes VERY quick."
digimon,38x88f,SydMontague,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:04:54 2015 UTC,"The navigation is a bit tricky though. There is a menu button in the top left-hand corner.  For example if you want to view skills, click menu button then skills."
digimon,38x88f,monkeysquirts,4,Mon Jun 8 15:16:01 2015 UTC,I didn't like Digimon World 1 but that's by far an unpopular opinion.  Digimon World 2 is my favorite but I am fine with long dungeon crawls and slow buildups of power and longer grinds.  If you don't like grinds or dungeons don't play.  Digimon World 3 is fantastic.  Digimon World 4 is great with friends.  Digimon Card battle (Trading Card Game?) is a lot of fun and underrated in my opinion.  Digimon World Dawn/Dusk are both fantastic if you like RPG's.    Digimon World Data Squad was absolutely garbage in my opinion.
digimon,38x88f,pkmongoose,11,Mon Jun 8 04:16:46 2015 UTC,Digimon World 1 is probably the best Digimon game. ;)
digimon,38x88f,befron,6,Sun Jun 7 18:27:52 2015 UTC,I love it! So good and hard
digimon,38x88f,mercu7y,3,Sun Jun 7 20:08:23 2015 UTC,"Play all of them. Each of them has their strengths and faults, but each of them has a charm that some people will find endearing."
digimon,38x88f,yiyopuga,2,Mon Jun 8 03:06:24 2015 UTC,"I have played both 1 and 4 and enjoyed them both a lot. For 4 you probably want some friends, going at it solo is a lot less fun. Also a lot of people dislike it, it deviates from the rest of the series, the combat is realtime vs strategy. Also the digivolutions are trash, you go through the whole game as a rookie, then once you beat it you unlock sidequests that give access to megas. I didn't have the drive to go through it twice once I beat it the first time."
digimon,38x88f,Clestonlee,2,Sun Jun 7 18:15:39 2015 UTC,digimon battle spirits 1 and 2 are good fun if you're on the go (GBA). they are 2d fighters and are pretty awesome.
digimon,38x88f,Ephraim225,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:52:44 2015 UTC,Battle spirit 2 is my jam. Many hours lost to that game. Still play it
digimon,38x88f,wynaut_23,2,Mon Jun 8 02:28:14 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of the DS games. They were fun RPGs, that being said I don't think I have beaten them yet but I think I will pick them back up. There is a cool mechanic to making your team and storing them that it interesting, plus the branches for digivolution are cool to play around with."
digimon,38x88f,WhiteKnight0194,2,Mon Jun 8 05:34:56 2015 UTC,"The best ones are: Digimon World, Digital Card Battle, and Digimon Rumble Arena.  Digimon World 2, 3, DS, and Dawn/Dusk are just okay. 2 and 3 involve a LOT of grinding, though."
digimon,38x88f,artezzatrigger,2,Mon Jun 8 23:25:26 2015 UTC,"You should play my game! Digimon Firered: https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/299dl2/digimon_firered_a_small_project_ive_finished/  I replaced all the pokemon with digimon with custom stats, you can even play it on your phone!"
digimon,38x88f,ShadeSoul,2,Tue Jun 9 03:15:46 2015 UTC,I liked dawn and dusk alot. I also liked digimon world 4 which is a diablo clone with digimon in it and im about to play it all the way through with a buddy at college this semester :).  None of them are the end all be all of gaming but there are some pretty good ones.
digimon,38x88f,JumpSlashShoot,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:07:33 2015 UTC,"What I personally enjoyed:  Digimon World 1  Digimon World 3  Digimon World DS  Digimon World Dawn  What I felt was bad:  Digimon World 2 (Frustrating dungeon mechanics, dna digivolving involves regression, making it too grindy even for a digimon game)  Digimon World 4 (Just...no)  Hands up in the air for the Data Squad game. Its honestly kind of forgotten, I never see it in game discussions so I've no idea on the consensus on it. Personally I found it to be nothing special, but didn't find it to be awful either."
digimon,38x88f,zaj209,1 point,Mon Jun 8 09:55:24 2015 UTC,Play Digimon world 1 &3.
digimon,38x88f,Casposaurus,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:12:15 2015 UTC,"Don't play digimon world 4 unless you have friends to play with (even then it is questionable). You pretty much spam one button and if you want to use non-rookies, you have to start from level 1 after unlocking them."
digimon,38x88f,Johntoreno,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:36:00 2015 UTC,Digimon world 3 is a must play. I just ordered dusk so I will let you know how that goes!
digimon,38zcyt,alvinchimp,6,Mon Jun 8 02:56:41 2015 UTC,"They're okay. My big problem with the subs aren't the accuracy, it's the fact that they're fucking yellow and don't have borders on them."
digimon,38zcyt,Stellefeder,11,Mon Jun 8 03:31:19 2015 UTC,"You have total control over subtitle appearance in Netflix.  Go to the Netflix website, sign in, and choose the profile you're using to watch (if you have multiple profiles.)  Go to your account with the dropdown window in the top-right corner.  Select Your Account.  Towards the end of the page, underneath Your Profile click on subtitle appearance.  As long as your device supports it, you'll have custom subtitles."
digimon,38zcyt,IncogM,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:03:11 2015 UTC,So they blend into the backgrounds then?
digimon,38zcyt,Stellefeder,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:54:22 2015 UTC,Sometimes. It's readable - I've been watching for a few weeks. You just have to pay attention a bit more.
digimon,38zcyt,dotyawning,4,Mon Jun 8 04:31:08 2015 UTC,"They range from good to decent to ""how many people did they get to translate this thing, and why didn't they have someone QC it a little better?""   The first time it was uploaded, Adventure was pretty laughable. Then it seemed to get better until the point where I wasn't noticing the quality at all, and focused only on whether they were using the original terms, the English dub terms, or something else altogether (Wizarmon's name stuck out to me as being really off at some points, but I couldn't tell you what it was)."
digimon,38zcyt,adamungar1,4,Mon Jun 8 04:01:13 2015 UTC,They called him withermon during his big episode haha
digimon,38zcyt,NotAEurosnob,2,Mon Jun 8 11:13:21 2015 UTC,"Are Adventure etc. only on US Netflix? I'm in the UK and I can't seem to find either Adventure or 02, which sucks."
digimon,38zcyt,Sagotomi,3,Mon Jun 8 10:38:41 2015 UTC,UK we only have fusion as of checking 2 mins ago
digimon,38zcyt,NotAEurosnob,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:41:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was what I thought. Sucks we don't get it, hopefully that'll change soon."
digimon,38zcyt,Johntoreno,0,Mon Jun 8 19:07:26 2015 UTC,It says Digimon adventure but it has 3 seasons. Season 1 is adventure season 2 is 02 and season 3 is Tamers.
digimon,38zcyt,UsulMaudDib,3,Mon Jun 8 16:05:04 2015 UTC,Better than the Eng dub translation that's for sure.
digimon,38zcyt,UsulMaudDib,0,Mon Jun 8 14:52:01 2015 UTC,XD  Yep
digimon,38zcyt,Sean93,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:05:09 2015 UTC,"I just finished watching the entire 1st season, and I'm beginning the 2nd. Overall the subtitles are good. The biggest problem is consistency. They tend to use 2 or 3 different names for some digimon. Not especially hard to follow, but noticeable in some cases."
digimon,38zcyt,Smallkittenfeet,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:12:22 2015 UTC,Hmm I watched about 10 episodes of digimon tamers and the subs were fairly good.  The digimon names seemed consistent at least.

digimon,38vd89,Giulls,7,Sun Jun 7 04:40:23 2015 UTC,"I actually love that part! It's a lot of training and some money early on, both things you really need at that point.  On the other hand Monochromon shop takes up half the waking hours of the day for some money and a somewhat luck based mini game."
digimon,38vd89,urdeluge,5,Sun Jun 7 04:54:12 2015 UTC,You can skip it if you wait enough days. Maybe do other quests while you wait :-)
digimon,38vd89,befron,5,Sun Jun 7 06:08:14 2015 UTC,I liked it. That easy money and stats yo
digimon,38vd89,meenor,3,Sun Jun 7 16:51:33 2015 UTC,"I can relate to this on the highest level!!!! Seriously I don't know why they slowed the pacing of the game so much with this part. What makes it worse is that it's so close to the beginning of the game.

digimon,38vd89,Ephraim225,3,Sun Jun 7 16:15:06 2015 UTC,"You don't need to avoid them, they actually talk to you and only if you press x by them. The game doesn't let you fight with the basket thing on your digimon."

digimon,38vd89,DahjerCanaan,0,Sun Jun 7 10:34:59 2015 UTC,"Yes Digimon 1 was great. So was Digimon 3. 2 and 4, yeah, not even close."
digimon,38vd89,KazyX,2,Sun Jun 7 16:37:47 2015 UTC,"I did enjoy Digimon World 3 quite a bit more than 2, so I guess it was okay, so we agree. None of them after Digimon World 1 had any ""re-play value"", even if you beat Digimon World 1 you could still continue the current game and fool around. I don't remember any of the other games after that having anything like that.  I would say that, that's the biggest thing that made Digimon World 1 the best and most enjoyable."
digimon,38u6iw,MidnightProfessional,14,Sat Jun 6 21:21:16 2015 UTC,"To be an optimist, the official japanese site has had English translations/versions of content since the very beginning. Indicating that they are at least AWARE of the international fandom"

digimon,38u6iw,Romiress,3,Sat Jun 6 21:51:20 2015 UTC,You're right - official subs they got.  But I expect Tri to get dubs.
digimon,38u6iw,Romiress,2,Sun Jun 7 00:17:41 2015 UTC,They will get it around the same time as THE DIGITAL DESTINY DINGO OF AUSTURALIA.
digimon,38vs6z,Keitren,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:25:14 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like it more than 02 and savers. I would put it third. I just wasn't a super big fan of some of the stuff after Cherubimon. All the stuff up til the royal knights I enjoyed. And yeah, i wish they could of gotten the combined spirit evolutions for the other kids as well. Also, the random kids showing up was kinda funny with angemon. Overall a decent series. At least to me."
digimon,38vs6z,akureikorineko,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:57:03 2015 UTC,"I'm going to report on Savers whenever I get around to binging it. But yeah I think it was better than 02 but the royal knights was too long. We got our last evolutions before we even could defeat the final bad guys, so the whole thing of Emperor Greymon and Mangna Garurumon just getting stronger and they fought more was kinda bland"
digimon,38vs6z,aDigifanmon,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:34:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if the other spirits could appear more it would be nice, maybe they thought it were too many characters to write.  The end arc with the Royal Knights is such a blatant filler. Almost all Digimon seasons manage to advance the plot and/or develop characters with each episode. Some episodes from that arc are refreshing, but most aren't and could be cut-off.  Speaking of developing characters, I think all of them are cool and interesting, but were not as evolved as in Digimon Adventure or Tamers. It also brings the worst female protagonist of the franchise, Zoe/Izumi, which had all that fanservice moments and was practically useless, it's like she's there only as pretty face. The brothers sub-plot was well-done. I kinda wish for it to be more explored, but I don't really see how they could do it.  Bokomon & Neamon: so annoying. Maybe because I watched this series later, but they are so unfunny and don't act like Digimons at all (did they even tried to fight once?). Tamers pulls it of with Calumon, as it does not end up being grating. I think the theory that they are humans that died and reborned as Digimons has some merit...  Finally, despite almost all episodes taking place in the Digital World, it looks more of a cardboard generic background. Other Digital Worlds were weirder, had something that made them feel important, unique, wonderful, and memorable.   In Digimon Adventure I can count at least 4 Digimon that helped the Digidestined and several others that were important in big ways, not counting villains. In Frontier we have the sacrifice of the Wizzardmon clone, which they cry about, but hypocritically not much though is dedicated to all others that sacrificed for them or died (directly or indirectly) from their actions.  Sorry for the rant! Just so we are clear, Frontier has very good things in it, sometimes it's just easier to talk about the things we dislike :)"

digimon,38t973,ArcticSwordofV,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:31:24 2015 UTC,It was pretty basic. You get 2-3 skills so there wasn't really much strategy. Still nice to see your fav digis doing stuff though.

digimon,38t973,Myxozoa,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:54:36 2015 UTC,"DMO is the only fully-english PC digimon game out there. I like it a lot, but it's true that you'll have to become a pretty good entrepreneur in order to afford anything without spending real money. Plus the server kinda sucks; I get disconnected pretty commonly during the loading screens that show up when moving from area to area. In the end, if you aren't enamored by it the moment you start playing, you probably wouldn't want to keep playing it after a few days of seeing all the problems it has."

digimon,38qkob,MrVolcano15,5,Fri Jun 5 23:52:12 2015 UTC,legit question: how long has this petition been going?

digimon,38qkob,Presenex,2,Sat Jun 6 01:42:39 2015 UTC,and i signed like 9 months ago...
digimon,38qkob,Giulls,2,Sat Jun 6 02:00:17 2015 UTC,its because no real news site has picked up on it. Now if this was helping get Kim Kardasian a new dress or someshit it would have over 400k in a week
digimon,38qkob,Giulls,2,Sat Jun 6 11:27:45 2015 UTC,its been out for along time but Namco just tweeted about it. so if we up the signatures that might push them over the edge and get it translated!

Anyway I'm guessing they're going to reanimate the Adventure evolution for maximum nostalgia. I do hope they insert Tamers evolution effect at some point as a nod to Tamers, it's my favourite sequence as well."
digimon,38q4mq,zsmg,5,Fri Jun 5 22:53:33 2015 UTC,Tamers is pretty dope. Picturing that with the original partner digimon is blowing my mind

digimon,38q4mq,Yoshiman400,12,Sat Jun 6 20:51:08 2015 UTC,The ones in Adventure 01 are best. Imo.
digimon,38q4mq,hoilori,4,Fri Jun 5 22:14:29 2015 UTC,"I do like those ones a lot as well. They just didn't age as well as the ones from Tamers, in my opinion."
digimon,38q4mq,bushysmalls,4,Fri Jun 5 22:19:18 2015 UTC,The sparkles firing off them as it pans down before the light shoots up out of them? Fuck yea my dude
digimon,38q4mq,Sea-Salt,11,Sat Jun 6 11:49:22 2015 UTC,"Well, hopefully the transition between rookie and champion is bit more than Rookie-spin-zoom in-zoom-out-CHAMPION!.   Also hoping for cel-animated evolution sequences when everybody reaches the Ultimate and Mega stages. It always looked odd (and a bit unfair) that only the two main boys of each series got CGI evolutions for their digimon."
digimon,38q4mq,Rixe,6,Sat Jun 6 03:35:08 2015 UTC,"It was even more jarring in Tamers when Rika was the only one not to have CGI. I mean come on, they're the only three characters who actually have an ultimate/mega digivolution sequence!"
digimon,38q4mq,bushysmalls,5,Sat Jun 6 08:53:28 2015 UTC,Wasn't hers the only one that didn't have metal covering most of her body? I've always thought that's why they did it that way..
digimon,38q4mq,Rixe,3,Sat Jun 6 11:50:38 2015 UTC,"I thought that as well, it makes sense but I don't like it.  Yeah, Taomon wore cloth, but all she does is spin round a bit as the sun and moon align. It looks a bit lazy next to the other two. Having said that, Sakuyamon had armour like Gallantmon. Her biomerge is pretty but it's just out of place next to the other two, especially when they play them right after each other."
digimon,38q4mq,bushysmalls,3,Sat Jun 6 13:34:54 2015 UTC,"Yea. Also remember we're talking about Japan where, as far as I can remember, female's in anime aren't exactly held up to the highest standards."

digimon,38q4mq,themightyarrow,3,Sat Jun 6 16:44:42 2015 UTC,I love music that plays during the Tamer evolutions.
digimon,38q4mq,dragons_scorn,3,Sat Jun 6 00:49:41 2015 UTC,Same! It's nice not hearing the original theme song playing over and over and over -__- (at least for the dub)
digimon,38q4mq,Pokelucelop,3,Sat Jun 6 01:04:52 2015 UTC,I want to see Champion to Ultimate and Warp digivolutions with the new technology we have available. The sequences will be beautiful
digimon,38q4mq,ShadeSoul,3,Sat Jun 6 05:22:20 2015 UTC,"A combo of the whole ""re-skinning"" transition from Tamers with the epic cgi digivice with the beam of light shooting out of it and doing its thang (from seasons 1 & 2). Not a fan of just rotating digimon saying their name lol. Haven't seen Savers. Season 4's transitions seemed super cool from what I remember, but I just can't see it fitting with non-humanoid digimon as well as the Tamers transition would."
digimon,38q4mq,EatThePath,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:56:26 2015 UTC,"The re-skinning cinematic for digivolutions in Tamers were my favorite. I hope they don't use the CGI digimon transformations, I always thought the CGI rendered Digivolves looked too garish and tacky."
digimon,38q4mq,Keepitstrong05,2,Tue Jun 9 08:54:06 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind them being updated to be a bit more elaborate, especially evolution to champion. But I wouldn't be surprised if we don't see much of the champions."
digimon,38q4mq,Webotama,2,Fri Jun 5 23:35:57 2015 UTC,There's going to be six movies around the original characters. I think it'd be highly unlikely that we don't see every Digivolution in the new animation style at least once each.
digimon,38q4mq,Webotama,2,Sat Jun 6 00:55:33 2015 UTC,Remember that Adventure-like evolution appears in Savers (The rotating thingy) so mayhe like that to all.

digimon,38q4mq,bushysmalls,1 point,Sat Jun 6 11:41:03 2015 UTC,"I know the Evolution Chart well without even looking at it, but I should point out that he never said that the First Adventure children couldn't use the eggs, just that they only work on certain digimon, which some of the original digimon cannot use them, and that only Tk and Kari have them. It stands that the eggs cannot be used without a D3 and only those 2 and Ken had their normal Digivices transformed to D3. The eggs belong with their Chosen Child and so in Tri I highly doubt that the eggs could be used with the other 6 digimon. To be fair its not even nessessary as the original 8 can normal digivolve at will to Champion and even further into Ultimates without using DNA digivolution. Pretty much everything used in 02 was weaker then the Ultimates and Megas of Adventure. I stand by this as none of the DNA digivolutions could defeat BlackWargreymon alone or in pairs, needing all 3 to even put up a good fight, while MagnaAngemon(granted, stronger then the average Ultimate) almost beat him 1-on-1 and might have if he had played smart and not used all his energy on his best attack in a all-or-nothing gamble."
digimon,38q4mq,Sneaks_exe,2,Sun Jun 7 04:57:03 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping the movies push everyone to mega and if they're worried that tai and matt aren't special snowflakes they could always go for the evolutions beyond mega, i.e victorygreymon and zeedgarurumon, i can imagine they're evolution somehting along the lines of they're armor shattering and reforming around them except warg's clwas become the victory blade.  also either the savers effect as its a more modern version of advenutres or something involving tamers because tamers"
digimon,38q4mq,Trieuazn,2,Sat Jun 6 08:36:03 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see the mega forms of the other digidestined.

digimon,38pjqx,jehk72,15,Fri Jun 5 19:27:28 2015 UTC,"They're alternate realities, where Digimon Adventure is considered a TV show in Tamers universe.  Funnily enough, the WonderSwan games explored the backstory between the one link between their universes- Ryo, who travelled from the Adventure universe to Tamers canon."
digimon,38pjqx,califexe,-1,Fri Jun 5 20:10:07 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Adventure wasn't a TV show in tamers.. its just a dub lore.
digimon,38pjqx,Johntoreno,4,Mon Jun 8 15:05:34 2015 UTC,I always liked to think they made a series from the events from the past.  They did have a passing comment in 02 that they should make a movie about their adventures.  But more says the alternate realities.

digimon,38pjqx,SydMontague,0,Fri Jun 5 20:28:44 2015 UTC,"It was probably mentioned only in the dubbed version, which had a more casual undertone to it."
digimon,38pjqx,Ventriloquy,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:13:08 2015 UTC,"It's explicitly hyped on in the dub, but the original production notes for the series, as well as several tie-ins which cross over Tamers and Adventure (notably including Hunters), make it clear that the Tamers are familiar with the Adventure characters, which implies that Adventure is the series the Tamers watched."
digimon,38pjqx,KrytenKoro,5,Sat Jun 6 19:48:18 2015 UTC,"Tamers and Adventure are 2 completly different universes with a fundamently different lore each.  Edit: To explain that a bit better. WIthin the main series Tamers and Adventure never interact with eachother nor do they share events or knowledge. But even more, they way how the digital worlds in Adventure and Tamers work are fundamently different. E.g. is death a permanent thing in Tamers, while Adventure has the Village of Beginning. Also, in Tamers the world and Digimon have been activly created by humans with the sole purpose of being the way they are (-> concious creation), while in Adventure Digimon and world are made up from actual data, that is not supposed to create the digital world in the first place, e.g. this text could be a chunk of dirt at the top of Mt. Infinity (-> unconcious creation).  And especially if we consider that Tamers tries to explain almost everything as much as possible in a believeable scientific and technical way (e.g. they explained the way Digimon realized and used the OSI model in order to describe the structure of the digital world), we should try to avoid ""magic"" as explaination."
digimon,38pjqx,SydMontague,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:33:55 2015 UTC,"e.g. this text could be a chunk of dirt at the top of Mt. Infinity (-> unconcious creation).   Dude, that's really interesting. I wonder if they could explore something like that more."
digimon,38pjqx,DeRockProject,6,Sat Jun 6 09:59:16 2015 UTC,"Tamers takes place in another universe separate from Adventure 01 & 02 in the Digimon multiverse.   edit: Actually, all Digimon series (aside from 01/02) take place in different universes. The digital world is what links them all together, which explains cameos and all that."
digimon,38pjqx,xeqtioner0,3,Fri Jun 5 20:22:17 2015 UTC,"It's an alternative universe in which Digimon is a popular card game. While there is some overlap with 02 (the four holy beasts make an appearance) it's really minor.  There's also Ryu but that character feels so out of place in Tamers, is forced into the series by the executives and gets no development that you're better of pretending he doesn't exist. He is by far the weakest thing about Tamers."
digimon,38pjqx,zsmg,3,Fri Jun 5 20:57:36 2015 UTC,"I agree I was so expecting him to turn out bad, because his digimon was so untamed I figured it was a reflection on the tamer like the other digimon"

Saved the world, but his digimon was never the same.    Doesn't make much sense when you haven't played the games though.  I think thats the same game that connects him to the Adventure universe.  So Ryu is a dimension hopper or something."

digimon,38m4w5,Giulls,3,Fri Jun 5 04:36:44 2015 UTC,"Everyone else has covered guides for the main game, but here's something that a lot of the guides at the time got wrong and I wish I knew at the time: technique learning! I've replayed after my childhood run with this in mind and it makes it much easier!   http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/913684-digimon-world/63048404"
digimon,38m4w5,didroy,2,Fri Jun 5 18:38:29 2015 UTC,"The Prima's Official Strategy Guide served me well when I played the game. Apparently there are a few errors in the digivolution stats but, aside from that, it's got everything you'd want to know about the game. Only problem would be tracking it down at a reasonable price: the cheapest on amazon.com is over $30, which I'd say is far too much to pay for just 92 pages of (mostly) captioned screenshots and short paragraphs. So finding an electronic copy of that would be good."

digimon,38m4w5,SydMontague,2,Fri Jun 5 03:52:34 2015 UTC,"The question is, what do you want to know?  The main problem with almost all guides I've seen so far is, that they either explain things incomplete or contain wrong information. That doesn't mean they're unuseable - especially things like recruitments are hard to mess up - however, you shouldn't take everything for the ultimate truth what you read, even (or maybe especially) when you read an official guide.  For Evolutions use this Guide. They took the data out of game files directly and are (except for some typos in names and IDs) correct. It also contains an explaination on how the evolution system works. It's doesn't explain some quirks with the system, but you should be able to get what you want quite easily.  Generally it's also a good idea to watch speedruns. To be quick in a game you have to understand how certain systems work at least on a surface level.  If you want to have more indepth explainations, e.g. how do care mistakes, lifetime or the damage formula work you will have a hard time to find correct ones in any online guide. Your best bet then would be, and I know this might sound a bit arrogant, to ask me. We've (I don't work alone) spent a good amount of time within the last months to learn how this game works. In order to do that we read the game memory itself, what allows us to easily see things that are hard or even impossible to spot from a solely ""player"" perspective.  Our goal is to create a guide ourselfs, but I can't give any ETA on that. (But again, I'm just a source on the Internet - I can be, and have been, wrong as well.)  Oh and it's actually a good idea to talk to the NPCs in File City from time to time as you progress through the game. They actually explain you quite a bit about certain mechanics."

digimon,38jt5f,skwakkie,2,Thu Jun 4 18:19:01 2015 UTC,I love these but can they please make one for kindness? I know that is sort of an obscure crest that isn't known until the second season and you don't even see it on a tag in the anime but one can still wish. I can never really decide if that one suits me better or reliability so I guess it shouldn't be a big deal to me.

digimon,38l62k,ramzar266,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:43:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is the US packaging, but thats the packaging that the bootlegs used.  He conveniently leaves out a picture of the back of the digivice (which is the easy way to tell fakes from the real deal.)  The red flag for me:  there are a couple different sellers from thailand that list those fake digivices and they always say ""The character have faint shadow around it or error pixels.""  Bootlets tend to have really crap screens that are overly dark. I've suspected thats what the sellers put in the description so they don't get in trouble for a bad digivice.  I don't know for sure though."

digimon,38l62k,chibirachy,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:36:12 2015 UTC,I don't think the digivice was ever released in the color used on the TV show. It's being released now in that color for the anniversary. This is the first time I've seen an older one use that color scheme.

digimon,38l62k,chibirachy,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:13:38 2015 UTC,"It's definitely been released in the colour shown. It isn't the anime colour, as that has a white-turquoise shell. This is just clear, and I've seen them on eBay many times, even from someone who I bought a different coloured Digivice from that was real. I don't see why they would sell real and fake. Anyway, I would avoid buying from this user anyway. His feedback rating is too low. You wanna buy from someone in the 99% range."
digimon,38l62k,Keepitstrong05,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:50:38 2015 UTC,"That one doesn't look like the other clear ones though. It has a bit of turquoise or some coloring... unlike the other clear ones, you can't see the inner workings."
digimon,38l62k,chibirachy,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:08:58 2015 UTC,"I know that. The turquoise colour is a new one, exclusively made for the 15th anniversary of the series.

digimon,38l62k,Keepitstrong05,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:11:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know. I'm getting the new one. However, the one pictured here isn't clear completely. You can't see inside. That's what I was saying. It's not like the other clear ones floating around on eBay."
digimon,38l62k,chibirachy,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:21:22 2015 UTC,"Oh, shit. Yeah, after taking a closer look, it is turquoise. You're right! Sorry about that. I didn't know fakes were sold in packaging like that!"
digimon,38i8uk,ResidentRedMage,2,Thu Jun 4 11:46:10 2015 UTC,I know theres a couple pokemon roms modded to be digimon and the digimobs mofd for minecraft. Other than that no clue. I think alot of focus has been on emulating the old digivice things (probably cause they are so expensive). Digimon mugen is a fan made fighting game but I don't really like it.

digimon,38c13q,hexanglec,28,Wed Jun 3 12:59:58 2015 UTC,One of the few occasions the dub totally outdoes the original IMO. MUCH more interesting dialogue the whole way through while not really changing anything that actually matters
digimon,38c13q,SSJ5Gogetenks,6,Wed Jun 3 13:00:26 2015 UTC,"Yessss this is one of the few anime movies/shows where I prefer the dub. It may just be nostalgia, but regardless, the voice acting is still fantastic. Even the 90s music I can dig after all these years because it complements the dub so well."
digimon,38c13q,Lasair,8,Wed Jun 3 14:52:43 2015 UTC,"As much crap as the dub gets, the first two parts of the movie aren't that bad, and at least resemble the original source material.  I'm convinced they were drunk in the editing room when adding the third movie in."
digimon,38c13q,Sea-Salt,5,Wed Jun 3 13:28:45 2015 UTC,"They didn't want to include it the third part at all because they thought it was a bad idea to introduce all these new characters in the 3rd act, but that's what Fox Kids wanted because toys make money happen. This is also the reason that Angela Anaconda is in the movie."
digimon,38c13q,SlumberCat,9,Wed Jun 3 15:01:46 2015 UTC,Hence why I always make sure to start the dvd via scene-select.
digimon,38c13q,Sea-Salt,2,Wed Jun 3 15:19:59 2015 UTC,What was the third part again?
digimon,38c13q,Sneaks_exe,8,Wed Jun 3 15:12:55 2015 UTC,Hurricane Touchdown; with Willis and Terriermon.
digimon,38c13q,Sea-Salt,2,Wed Jun 3 15:19:01 2015 UTC,"So, what are all three parts? I only remember the part where they have to fight diaboromon and hurrican touchdown."
digimon,38c13q,Sneaks_exe,9,Wed Jun 3 17:17:28 2015 UTC,The first part is the one you're missing--it's the fight with Greymon and Parrotmon which is basicially the origin story of Adventure.
digimon,38c13q,Yoshiman400,4,Wed Jun 3 17:19:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, as far as the voices themselves go, I'd say this is one of the better anime dubs I've heard, but maybe that is nostalgia talking."
digimon,38c13q,RoachPowder,9,Wed Jun 3 16:14:09 2015 UTC,"The Digimon dub in general is one of the better kids' dubs out there. People want to rag on the bad jokes, but forget that the series gets away with a lot more than you'd expect for a Saturday-morning cartoon.  If this was handled by, say, 4Kids, half of the fights would be blurred out or obscured in some other way, all references to Japan would swept under the rug, the kids themselves would have different names (at least the dub names here are treated as nicknames). And there's no way terrorism would ever be mentioned as a scapegoat for the Greymon/Parrotmon fight, not in this day and age.  That's not even going into Tamers, which at that point, I figure everybody was thinking, ""Well, Fox is cancelling our programming next season anyway, let's see what we can slip by! What are they gonna do, FIRE us?"""
digimon,38c13q,Sea-Salt,8,Wed Jun 3 17:11:24 2015 UTC,"Also, I've just always loved Kari's voice especially. I'm the type of person who watches things subbed generally. But Digimon's dub really did do a lot."
digimon,38c13q,RoachPowder,9,Wed Jun 3 17:16:39 2015 UTC,"Most of the cast were some pretty big dub actors, too. Steve Blum voiced no less than three characters I can think of from the whole franchise, and Mona Marshall (Izzy) might as well be the go-to lady for voicing young male characters.  I also love the fact that Kari mentions she wants to be a teacher, and then come Tamers, Takato's teacher is voiced by the same woman. I'm not sure if they did that on purpose, but I really want to believe."
digimon,38c13q,Sea-Salt,6,Wed Jun 3 17:27:00 2015 UTC,I'm 99% sure they did.

digimon,38c13q,Tom_The_Human,7,Wed Jun 3 14:12:50 2015 UTC,the dub is so funny. I know people really don't like it but I think the bad/awkward humor in it seriously makes it great.
digimon,38c13q,pinkoctillery,2,Wed Jun 3 15:16:09 2015 UTC,"When the bad humor takes away from scenes that are supposed to be serious, it takes a lot of potential emotional impact away."

digimon,38c13q,pinkoctillery,2,Wed Jun 3 16:58:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe that's one of the differences between the dub and the sub. In Asia and other parts of the world, I think people remember digimon for its emotional impact, whereas in America, you, and maybe other people remember it for its cheesy humor.   Have you ever watched the sub? If you haven't I encourage you to do so, just to see for yourself what American kids may have missed out on."

digimon,37v53j,Fungruel,12,Sat May 30 17:36:47 2015 UTC,"The answer is quite simple: she isn't. At least not in the first season, where she knocks out Greymon, Kabuterimon and Ikkakumon with one hit each.  In the 2nd season she loses her holy ring and a lot of her powers with it - which is probably the cause why you observed her so weak."
digimon,37v53j,SydMontague,6,Sat May 30 17:49:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I had actually forgotten about her fighting the Digidestined's Digimon. I just finished the first Adventure season and I'd kind of gotten used to the Ultimates doing the fighting. I kind of think that they powered her way up for that fight though, just to make her seem more dangerous and to make her story and transition into a Digidestined Digimon  more... intense, or a bigger deal? I don't know how to word it.  I just started season two too, and I was really hoping that losing the ring wouldn't be the answer because it's so obvious.   Thanks for answering though."
digimon,37v53j,SirLlamaTheGrad,8,Sat May 30 18:07:02 2015 UTC,"They kinda established that she had naturally evolved to champion in the first season, but in the 2nd season for story reasons they needed her to be less powerful so she would be on par with the others who were rookies. So she 'lost her tail ring that gave her so much power' and then she was not so great anymore.   I really hope she functions like a proper champion in Tri :/ I liked the concept of a tiny cute little kitty cat being the most badass combat specialist who can take down greymon in one hit :D"
digimon,37v53j,Spanish_Galleon,4,Sat May 30 18:33:27 2015 UTC,The power ring is basically the answer but also she teams up with Kari who is the closest thing to a pacifist a group of revolutionaries can have. She Also is a young'en

digimon,37rl9b,DanGF0,10,Fri May 29 20:44:41 2015 UTC,"The strange thing is that the series is essentially told from T.K.'s point of view. It begins with his first day at a new school, and the series concludes with his narration as a famous author writing about their adventures.   But other than those two bookends, they switch focus based on Davis. Maybe this is because T.K. is at heart an observer (hence becoming a writer) instead of someone who prefers to take charge as leader?"
digimon,37rl9b,neurotic_panda,1 point,Sat May 30 02:27:34 2015 UTC,It would still be pretty cool to just have him as the leader...
digimon,37rl9b,SydMontague,9,Sat May 30 06:57:37 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess you mean the leadership of the group instead of ""main character"", as the individual group members are about equally ""main"" in both adventure seasons.  There is certainly a lot wrong with 02 and that the leadership of the group is not topic in at least 1 episode is kind of sad. However, another questions that arises is, ""Is Takeru able to be the leader of the group?"" and on the other hand ""Would Takeru be willing to lead the group?"". Leadership skills are something not every person possess nor are leading roles something that suit every person. Some people simply function better in certain roles (best example is probably Koushiro/Izzy). And I'm honestly not quite sure whether Takeru (or Hikari for that matter) would be good leaders - having a big brother is probably not the best pre-condition for leadership skills. ;)  However, as I already pointed out, they should've made this to a conflict within the show. Either by Daisuke/Davis having to claim that position/proving that he's worthy or by handling how Takeru sees himself unable to take over that role. It would've been a great character development, too."
digimon,37rl9b,neurotic_panda,4,Fri May 29 22:34:54 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree with you. I think T.K. struggling with whether or not he is suited to lead the new digidestined makes for a MUCH more interesting/logical internal conflict than, say, that really convoluted issue T.K. apparently has with darkness/Ken."
digimon,37rl9b,Yoshiman400,1 point,Sat May 30 02:29:04 2015 UTC,It could have been interesting to do a storyline (either before or after Ken turns to the good side) where Takeru and Daisuke finally come to blows to the point where they have no choice but to split. This causing a schism amongst the whole group of Chosens (including Adventure pairs) where the two groups proceed in different directions with their leaders having serious difficulties communicating with each other for a while.
digimon,37rl9b,Clarkmeister,1 point,Sat May 30 12:40:50 2015 UTC,"That would be very interesting if it went on for several episodes, before being forced to work together under either one, or co-, leaders."
digimon,37rl9b,grindor6666,1 point,Sat May 30 12:52:12 2015 UTC,Tai did prove that he was a leader because of the way he could get everyone together. Daisuke/Davis only did it in the ending
digimon,37rl9b,Masterofknees,15,Sat May 30 13:11:04 2015 UTC,"Definitely not, T.K. is the most veteran member in the 02 squad as he was there right from the beginning of Adventure, it'd only have been logical imo."
digimon,37rl9b,ElModeloEnPace,10,Fri May 29 21:40:45 2015 UTC,That and he's a lot less annoying that Davis.
digimon,37rl9b,Masterofknees,7,Fri May 29 22:16:51 2015 UTC,"I tried to avoid saying that, but yes, absolutely."
digimon,37rl9b,ravenclaw1991,5,Fri May 29 22:21:28 2015 UTC,"I agree so much. I was so angry, even as a kid, when Davis came out of nowhere and ended up being the leader of the group. It should've been TK, even over Kari. He was there from the beginning. She was still there longer than the others, but not as long as TK. It just wasn't fair. And I love TK and being the leader could've let him grow even more."

The longest evolution sequence in Adventure is in episode 40, which uses about 3 minutes and 15 seconds of reused material. The 2nd longest that comes in my mind is in Episode 53 with about 2 minutes reused material.  But for that matter keep in mind that this show originally was targeted at a younger audience. Reusing the evolution sequence has some positive aspects besides it's production advantages (cheaper to produce, allows to adjust episode lenght) it surly has some advantages for the original target audience, by giving them an easily recognizeable sequence with a song they can sing along."

digimon,37kesh,SydMontague,4,Thu May 28 09:05:17 2015 UTC,What was it about ? The dark sea thing ? They mentioned it close to the end but never did anything with that
digimon,37kesh,aes110,6,Thu May 28 08:40:38 2015 UTC,"Dark Sea = Dark Area = Wasted potential about really, really dark Digimon against the children, but no, a bad human who is jealous and an overused character who was moving the strings from behind was way better than that"
digimon,37kesh,Webotama,3,Thu May 28 22:29:23 2015 UTC,"My information could be contracted by an interview somewhere, but I don't think there was ever any intention to make a full plot arc out of the Dagomon episode. Rather, it was just a one-off scenario by guest contributor Chiaki J. Konaka. McFeely's dated, but he used to be the expert on these things, especially on the dub, so here's his encyclopedia entry.  /u/SydMontague correctly mentioned Cthulhu as the source for Dagomon, who obviously looks like the octopus-faced sea monster-god. Konaka is a well-known fan of the Cthulhu mythos, and there are references to Lovecraft throughout Tamers, where Konaka did most of his Digimon work (Hypnos, Yuugoth). The Zero Two episode is based on the The Shadow over Innsmouth, which explains why a Digimon episode is suddenly suggesting Kari could breed with fish-people.  And Daemon is just inexplicable. As much as I'd like to blame production costs or something else for Zero Two's Swiss cheese plot, sometimes the story takes weird detours for no reason."

digimon,37eix4,MagicCoat,2,Thu May 28 04:23:24 2015 UTC,A lot of the script is actually the same in the dub. Pretty interesting.  ....unless this was guess-subbed? But I don't think so.

digimon,37dhw2,bat1939,30,Tue May 26 20:52:59 2015 UTC,"(Note: Tailmon = Gatomon)  There are a handful of reasons for Tailmon being on the Champion/Adult level.     The character itself got introduced as villain and in order to explain why she is able to knock out multiple champion level Digimon in Episode 27 she simply has to be at the Champion/Adult level herself. You could argue that this scene is quite unimportant and could've been left out, but I'd disagree. By showing Tailmon's power and abilities they created a character the viewer takes serious instead of seeing her as a kitten. Therefore everytime she appears on screen the viewers knows, that her actions actually matter - unlike the actions of Demi/PicoDevimon, which always end with him failing. While most of us know the Rookie and Champion/Adult level, they're actually called child and adult level in the japanese original. And Tailmon is by far more mature/adultish than the other 7 Digimon, so that the authors may have thought, that calling her ""child"" wouldn't do the character any justice. After all, she got a lot life experience - things that formed her character a lot. At the point she gets introduced most Digimon of the group reached the ultimate/perfect level. And as her role in the Myotismon/Vamdemon arc is to kill him, she needs to reach the ultimate level within that arc, too. But introducing 2 new evolutions for the same character in the same arc wouldn't a sign of good pacing/writing, so it was a better solution to let her be on the Champion/Adult level.   As always, the truth is probably a mix of everything.   Oh, and for the reason why she stays at the champion level: she explains it with her ""possessing a different level of self-disclipline compared to the rest""."
digimon,37dhw2,SydMontague,21,Tue May 26 21:55:22 2015 UTC,"All some great points - adding onto that is the way evolution works in the wild.  Wild digimon who don't have a partner basically can evolve and maintain their forms over time. That's why you see wild champsions/ultimates/megas walking around. You also see this with MarineAngemon in tamers - because it was a mega before it got a partner, it can maintain it's mega form."
digimon,37dhw2,Romiress,1 point,Tue May 26 23:19:22 2015 UTC,"Wasn't that because Calumon made all the other Digimon digivolve, though?"
digimon,37dhw2,Deadpool312,1 point,Sun May 31 08:36:43 2015 UTC,"Calumon in tamers can make digimon digivolve at random, but they're not the sole source of it as far as we can tell."
digimon,37dhw2,Romiress,5,Sun May 31 13:52:06 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for the info. I understand it a little better
digimon,37dhw2,silverwolf874,3,Tue May 26 23:48:34 2015 UTC,doesn't her tail ring also give her the power to maintain champion with out a partner?
digimon,37dhw2,Zen-Zinxe,7,Tue May 26 23:45:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I thought this was the case as well. But Gatomon lost her tail ring in season 2 and didn't revert to salamon, so it couldn't be that."
digimon,37dhw2,SydMontague,2,Tue May 26 23:56:40 2015 UTC,"I can't recall that being mentioned somewhere. However, I doubt it. The holy ring is part of her evolution line (-> Solomon/Plotmon has a holy ring as collar) and losing it in 02 ""only"" made her weaker. (Although Tailmon was obviously with partner at this point) But I would also argue that Tailmon never was ""without"" partner. After all, Tailmon and the others were connected to their partners from the very begining of her life, making them their partners, even though they has to wait up to ~5760 years for them."
digimon,37dhw2,ManceRaman,1 point,Wed May 27 00:04:55 2015 UTC,"How did you get 5760 years?  I know time passes a lot faster in the digital world in 01, I just want to know your calculation behind it. I'm currently re watching the first season myself haha"
digimon,37dhw2,SydMontague,5,Wed May 27 02:25:43 2015 UTC,"Within the season it gets revealed that 1 minute in the human world is 1 day in the digital world and it matches with the time that passed in the digital world while Taichi is in the human world.  -> The Digital world is 1440 times faster than the human world. And as the events of Hikarigaoka and the summer camp are about 4 years apart, about 5760 years must have passed in the digital world. Of course we don't know when they actually created the eggs, crests and digivices, however I think they did it pretty quickly, as File Island is at this point of time still covered in ice - and a climatic change takes some time. Another thing we don't know is when exactly the Digimon hatched. The first scene (timeline wise) we see them in, File Island is mostly ice free, so it might have taken a few hundred years for them to hatch. And actually there is another possible point why Tailmon is a level hight: as her egg was dropped over the Server continent, she might've hatched earlier."
digimon,37dhw2,fctd,9,Wed May 27 09:43:01 2015 UTC,It's always bothered me that Angemon is a Champion level but Angewomon is Ultimate.
digimon,37dhw2,jreesing,5,Wed May 27 04:06:09 2015 UTC,Right and most of the times it portrayed them as equal too. Which was......surprising.
digimon,37dhw2,Tomhap,7,Wed May 27 08:10:56 2015 UTC,Isn't that because Angemon is very strong for a Champion level digimon? In the first arc of 01 Angemon could take on Devimon whilst the other champion level digimon fo do it combined.
digimon,37dhw2,fifthalicorn,3,Wed May 27 14:43:28 2015 UTC,"Two things.   1) When Angemon took down Devimon, he harnessed the purifying light of all the digivices AND used all of his power. Literally just watched this so it's fresh in my memory   2) And while I know it's the dub and the dub is persona non grata here, something interesting I noticed was that, when Patamon evolved into Angemon and Angemon into Magnangemon, and this is in 01 only, the background theme says ""digivolve into Champion"" and ""Warp digivolve"" respectively. Kind of implying Angemon had a lot more power to throw around than other Champions"
digimon,37dhw2,Webotama,1 point,Wed May 27 16:04:56 2015 UTC,"You could say Deus Ex Machina, because is the light, the angel, bla bla, but in every game Angel Type or Light Element is effective vs Demon type or Dark Element (And the other way around too) so a hit from Angemon is way more effective than those of the other Adults plus the digivice's power"
digimon,37dhw2,Callizero,3,Thu May 28 22:38:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I know it annoyed me tbh.  TK and Patamon where my more favorite duo but the progression in power for Patamon was so weird... Patamon as a Rookie seemed rather weak in comparison to the rest then Angemon as a champion was by far the strongest and felt as strong as the ultimates then Magnaangemon he just felt middle of the pack and not much of an upgrade in power at all.
digimon,37dhw2,windwalker13,4,Thu May 28 11:37:11 2015 UTC,"umm I think you underestimate MagnaAngemon's power. He is the one who dealt the finishing blow to Piedmon. The rest of the Digidestined can only weaken Piedmon through their attacks but not kill him.   In season 2, MagnaAngemon almost single-handedly beat BlackWargreymon, a Mega-level digimon. He only failed to do so because the stone was destroyed and MagnaAngemon cannot maintain his Ultimate form.   However, this probably has something to do with his affinity. His attacks are extra effective against creature with dark powers.   As for Patamon, I thought the theme was clear. They want to tell us not to underestimate the youngest and the weakest member of the group who always needs protection (by Matt in this case). Because it is possible they can have a greater power and potential then the rest of us will ever have.   In the subbed, TK is always sad that Patamon cannot digivolve to Champion level for a long long time, and it always haunt him. He thought he or his digimon is really weak and is a liability to the group."
digimon,37dhw2,shadowpikachu,1 point,Thu May 28 19:44:00 2015 UTC,What confuses me is one time gato digivolves with the crest and other times not.  But it is still angewomon either way.
digimon,37dhw2,Webotama,1 point,Thu May 28 14:02:15 2015 UTC,Also Devimon (Adult) and LadyDevimon (Perfect)
digimon,37dhw2,xeqtioner0,3,Thu May 28 22:38:34 2015 UTC,"I always thought it was because she was older than the other digidestined digimon. If you remember, Gatomon was the only one who had originally hatched, while the other eggs were scattered. Her being able to maintian her Champion form at all times is probably something all Digimon go through when they age naturally."
digimon,37dhw2,Yoshiman400,7,Tue May 26 20:56:18 2015 UTC,"I've theorized that in addition to being more mature, her form is a lot smaller than everyone else's Adult/Champion forms, so in a perspective of being data, she takes up ""less space"" or at least doesn't need to process as much data to stably keep her form."
digimon,37dhw2,Wedgamus,3,Tue May 26 22:38:38 2015 UTC,Wasn't it also mentioned that she was beaten and tortured by Myotismon so the only way her body could take it constantly was by forcing a digivolution and maintaining it?
digimon,37dhw2,user2338,2,Wed May 27 03:54:31 2015 UTC,"When she got lost, and away from the whole gang, she digivolved due to Myotismon's powers. If she wouldn't have gotten lost, she would still be a rookie (Salamon)."
digimon,37dhw2,aes110,2,Wed May 27 18:35:06 2015 UTC,As said below but If I was in charge of her digivolution line it would go like   Fresh Nyaromon  In-Training Salamon   Rookie Gatomon  Champion Magnadramon   Ultimate Angewomon   Mega Ophanimon
digimon,37dhw2,Animal31,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:22:45 2015 UTC,"I'm my opinion she reached champion level on her own , that's why she stays like that (like every other digimon on the digital world) but the others need the digivices to evolve so they always return to the base form"
digimon,37dhw2,Sagotomi,1 point,Thu May 28 08:43:19 2015 UTC,Because she has the strength of a Champion level digimon
digimon,37dhw2,califexe,1 point,Fri May 29 05:27:24 2015 UTC,Because thats the way the digivolution line goes. if you mean why is she a champ its because myotismon messed around with her and made her digivolve

That being said, my data is mostly for Digimon World 1. Digimon World 2 is probably not as popular as a) it never got released in the EU and b) it's a really bad game (in my eyes).

It's almost never spelled out, but almost every major enemy is defeated by exploiting a weakness.  Devimon and Myotismon (first form) are beaten quickly by holy digimon. (Piedmon is also likely vulnerable to holy damage, but it's less obvious as to weather he is a demon proper.) Machinedramon and Metalseadramon are beaten by Wargraymon, who is a dramon destroyer. Puppetmon, a machine/nature digimon, was finally defeated by Metalgarurumon's ice attack. And Etemon, who presumably has no weakness to exploit, was instead beaten by turning his own power against him.   Several other digimon were beaten by Chrome Digizoid use, and so fourth.

They are descendants of Dracomon, an ancient, pure-blooded Dragon Digimon.  To be worthy of the name ""Dramon"", a Digimon typically needs to possess some Dragon data in their DigiCores.  The Dragon Man Digimon WarGreymon—as well as its darker derivatives BlackWarGreymon and ChaosBlackWarGreymon—wears special ""Dramon Destroyer"" (Dramon Kiler) gauntlets on its arms which are deadly to Dramon Digimon, though they put itself at risk as well.

digimon,372409,zafrench,26,Sun May 24 03:43:00 2015 UTC,"I prefer it to have 6 movies instead of a series. It will be higher quality and more satisfying. I mean compare a really short series to a really long one, like Fooly Cooly to Naruto. FLCL is more artistic, it has a very unique and detailed art style, while Naruto has gone on WAY too long, it's plot lines became dull and confusing, and it's seen more as a stereotype for anime than anything else"
digimon,372409,Animedingo,5,Sun May 24 05:29:56 2015 UTC,"I feel like being a shorter series doesn't guarantee being ""more artistic"", though it is certainly much harder (maybe impossible?) to make a series truly deep and satisfying all the way through for 100+ episodes, and the same goes for quality of animation/art style. There are great shorter series, and there are crap shirt series just like there are crap long shows and above average long shows.   When you know you're only responsible for 25 episodes, you can put more detail into each one and have them all stand on the same level of quality, but when you're tasked with creating a long series, shortcuts just need to be taken in order to meet deadlines, but even then there can be some standout episodes of higher quality. Just look at the original Digimon series and that first Episode back in the real world.  As for Naruto, I feel that the biggest thing hurting it is the filler (note: haven't finished the series). Its hard for me to watch Naruto consistently; instead I go on binges of an arc or 2 at a time (over the course of a week or two), then take a break to watch or do something else for a few weeks. Most recently, I was stuck for a few months in the 2 tails arc. Sure the crystal style thing was cool, but it just dragged on, and even worse repeated itself nonstop, leaving me with a sense that it really wasn't going anywhere.   When that had wrapped up though, I breezed through the next few episodes because they actually felt relevant to the overall story, or at least offered some interesting history. Then there was Jiraiya vs Pein which was pretty balls-to-the-wall awesome (and maybe I'm misremembering, but I believe there was a bit of a step up in animation quality for the couple of episodes that focused on the fight).  But now (and for the past few months) I'm stuck once again in the middle of an arc about a bubble blowing ninja that feels largely tacked on and irrelevant.  A six (or maybe even twenty) movie set isn't really a format that would be able to tell the story of Naruto in any real cohesive manner, because some of the in-between parts are important, but it would certainly cut down on filler and keep things exciting moving from major event to major event."
digimon,372409,TransPM,2,Sun May 24 18:44:29 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it wouldn't be difficult to find out what episodes of Naruto are filler so you can just skip it.   Even Filler aside, the manga, which has no filler felt like it dragged on for too long."
digimon,372409,Animedingo,2,Sun May 24 18:57:57 2015 UTC,"I've considered skipping the filler, but some of it (the flashbacks in particular) are legitimately interesting, or might give some foreshadowing or background into what happens next. The biggest problem with most filler arcs is that at their core, they're and interesting concept or story, but while they could be told in 3-4 episodes, the creators choose to stretch them for sometimes 7-10 either fill fill a schedule or stall in between major story events because they have to consider the timeline for the manga's completion."
digimon,372409,TransPM,2,Sun May 24 19:20:12 2015 UTC,"Ok...I'mma let you in on a little secret...  none, and i mean literally, none of the filler arcs matter. They're put into the series to stretch it out between the story arcs. SOMETIMES they're referenced, like in the original Naruto series, during that stupid lightening sword race arc, when Sasuke is in the hospital, he has flashbacks to it, but it completely doesn't matter cause Sasuke was in the hospital regardless.   I'm sure at least a couple of the filler arcs are entertaining, but most of them are garbage, literally, inconsequential, unimportant, garbage."
digimon,372409,Animedingo,1 point,Sun May 24 19:27:33 2015 UTC,"For the ones that ""matter"" I was speaking more specifically about the ""flashback"" arcs, such as the story of Kakashi's sharingan and Jiraiya training the rain ninja. These give insight into characters you already know as well as introducing (or at least foreshadowing) characters you haven't met yet and giving some insight into their character and motivations as well.   Its been a few years since I watched the original Naruto actually, but I do remember its filler being largely crap, so I'm also really only commenting on the filler in Shippuden (which so far there's been much less of).  Only Shippuden filler I can think of at the moment (again, excluding ""flashbacks"") is maybe some of the ""Land of Fire"" arc (but that was important for characterizing Asuma much more than he'd ever been before), the 2-tails arc (it was kinda nice to know where the 2-tails came from I suppose, but it was about 4x longer than it needed to be), and now this current bubble ninja thing (though i believe it also has some connection to a tailed beast). Everything between Sasuke vs Orichimaru and Sasuke vs Daedara could also possibly be considered filler, but again it introduced 3 new characters and gave some more insight into how the past few years went for Sasuke, so it definitely had some value.  Its mainly the ""characters constantly quoting themselves/others"" and ""replaying clips from 1-3 episodes ago"" parts that really bother me. Its not like anybody is stupid enough to forget these clearly very important themes after the third time somebody spoke them aloud, so saying them the fourth through tenth times serves no purpose other than stalling and stretching out 4 episodes worth of narrative and action into 12. I swear, if I hear ""wherever somebody is thinking about you, that place is your home"" one more time, somebody's getting punched. At this point I'd prefer if they just designated 1 character, like maybe Yamato, to just break the 4th wall, turn to the camera, and dead-pan say ""this is important because it doesn't just relate to Naruto and the kid, it also relates to Naruto and Sasuke"", then just be done with it."
digimon,372409,TransPM,2,Sun May 24 19:59:36 2015 UTC,"For the ones that ""matter"" I was speaking more specifically about the ""flashback"" arcs, such as the story of Kakashi's sharingan and Jiraiya training the rain ninja.   Not sure if it needs clarifying, but those two sets of flashbacks weren't filler and wouldn't be skipped if you were to avoid filler.  That said, Naruto absolutely dragged on for far too long. It ran for 15 freaking years. One Piece has been the only manga series I've seen that can pull of that kind of longevity and remain interesting."
digimon,372409,Calhoun1389,5,Sun May 24 21:05:22 2015 UTC,I feel like even rewatching Digimon Seasons is boring sometimes. It's much easier for me to rewatch movies!

digimon,372409,Kyogreprince,5,Sun May 24 17:02:35 2015 UTC,Dude the Naruto anime is one of the worst freaking anime's I've ever seen. I read the manga and the anime is 1000% slower paced than the manga and the production value for the average episode is bad.
digimon,372409,tw04,5,Sun May 24 17:26:31 2015 UTC,"To be honest I really liked a lot of the earlier episodes of Naruto, actually for the most part I liked the entirity of Naruto before shippuden (minus filler obvs)  The really stylized fight scenes, like Sasuke vs Orochimaru for the first time, or Gaara vs Rock Lee were awesome.   Even shippuden has its great moments, like when Pain is destroying the entire village, literally everyone is dead, and Naruto shows up from his training with 3 giant fucking frogs, decked out in a badass cape, and he just shuts everything down.   There was a lot of Naruto I really liked, but there's too much naruto. So much, that I really only remember the series as a let down, I remember it dragging on way too long and the writing getting sloppier."
digimon,372409,Animedingo,2,Sun May 24 19:39:31 2015 UTC,I liked the fight scenes but the pacing of an average episode felt way too slow for me personally. This might be because I read the manga first but when I try to watch a full episode of Naruto I just get really impatient.
digimon,372409,tw04,2,Sun May 24 20:29:29 2015 UTC,There are some really badass episodes that were animated (when Madara makes his appearance is one of the best fights of all time) but a lot of the episodes were filled with flashbacks and filler crap. The animation studios are too focused on dragging it out to get more money which waters down the product.
digimon,372409,SometimesY,2,Sun May 24 19:17:47 2015 UTC,That's true. I did enjoy the fight scenes but they're constantly bogged down by slow/forced flashbacks and dialogue.
digimon,372409,tw04,2,Sun May 24 20:28:00 2015 UTC,"Filler isn't created to ""drag it out to get more money,"" it's generally made to ensure that the anime doesn't surpass the manga, which Naruto almost did several times because they stupidly started airing the anime before the manga's 14th volume was released."
digimon,372409,Calhoun1389,1 point,Sun May 24 21:07:30 2015 UTC,"Well this is true. I guess I was thinking about more recent episodes in the anime. Recency bias and all. Before they started the months of filler, they could have just kept going and finished a few months after the manga."
digimon,372409,SometimesY,1 point,Sun May 24 22:21:35 2015 UTC,"Maybe. We also have to take into account that episodes take 6-7 months to make and the end of the series wasn't exactly told to people before it hit. The fact that Japan doesn't do seasonal breaks means that episodes have to be made well in advance in order to keep the stream going. I would imagine that Kishimoto didn't tell anyone how or when he planned on ending the series, so they made enough filler to make sure he could keep going into 2015 if he wanted to."
digimon,372409,Calhoun1389,1 point,Mon May 25 05:39:25 2015 UTC,I didn't realize it took that long to animate episodes. I figured it took a month or so. In that case I completely retract my comment.
digimon,372409,SometimesY,1 point,Mon May 25 05:44:05 2015 UTC,"The pacing is fine a chapter an episode,perfect just skip the filler episodes and stop whining"
digimon,372409,Kyogreprince,1 point,Sun May 24 20:40:31 2015 UTC,Chapter takes 5 minutes to read but 20 minutes to watch. For every episode they have to add 20 seconds of silent staring between each line of dialogue and 5 flashback scenes to fill the time. The only ones worth watching are the episodes with good fight scenes.
digimon,372409,tw04,1 point,Sun May 24 21:07:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this ignores that the manga's pacing was god awful for years and went on for way too long."

digimon,372409,Animedingo,1 point,Sun May 24 17:26:18 2015 UTC,"Filler is the exact reason I stopped watching the anime. But even in the manga, the ending was waaaay too drawn out. The last arc was very long and boring.  So movies for Digimon Tri are a good way to go."

It's going to be 2021 before we get them all."
digimon,372409,Romiress,8,Sun May 24 04:22:54 2015 UTC,"Of course Bandai is much bigger than Aniplex, and Persona only recently became popular in the states in the last 4 or so years. Digimon has been international for decades, even if it's not quite as profitable here in the west."
digimon,372409,Animedingo,-1,Sun May 24 05:31:43 2015 UTC,"What does being popular in the states have to do with it? It took three years to release in Japan. The subtitled versions require there to be a bluray, which it took 8+ months to release."

Really good stats from very good fusions.) but didn't have the patience and never got past floor 60 (Or maybe 70) of Tera Domain."
digimon,3723e8,zafrench,18,Sun May 24 03:36:11 2015 UTC,"As usual, the first 13 episodes are pretty much setting up the characters. Once the series gets that out of the way is when the main story tends to kick in.  With Tamers, the Devas are introduced at ep. 14, and that leads up to the digital world arc where shit really starts getting real.  Just give it a little time; Tamers is definitely one of the best series of the entire franchise."
digimon,3723e8,Sea-Salt,10,Sun May 24 03:47:05 2015 UTC,"Tamers is supposed to be Digimon if it was actually real. A lot of the stuff in it is stuff that would happen in real life. How would you get them to devolve? How do you keep them a secret? How would you react to your best friend turning into a bit of a confrontation crazed freak? What role does government have in all of this? Honestly that is one of my favorite parts of the show and what is really eerie is that Hypnos is a government agency that spies on its own citizens. It's an extremely deep idea for a kid's show and it's way ahead of its time with all of the recent revelations. Out of all of them, I think Tamers has aged the best with all of the forethought they put into it top to bottom."
digimon,3723e8,SometimesY,2,Sun May 24 19:27:09 2015 UTC,"Tamers takes a long time to pick up, but it does accelerate. It just takes its time with world building."

digimon,3723e8,gallyguru,-1,Sun May 24 08:57:53 2015 UTC,Personally I never liked the Digimon Tamers series and it was one of the only ones I didn't like. It just seemed super slow overall to me and the whole thing with it taking place in the real world a majority of the time made it even worse for me.
digimon,370ekr,HXHBloody,3,Sat May 23 18:22:36 2015 UTC,Did they edit out Calumon's gem?
digimon,370ekr,CCRLS,5,Sat May 23 22:08:28 2015 UTC,"holy shit they did, I wonder why they did this. Has to be some religious reasons."
digimon,370ekr,Dose_x2,0,Sun May 24 02:24:51 2015 UTC,"I grew up in Syria (heavily Islamic country) and I remember when watching the show in Arabic Calumon had the symbol on his forehead most of the time, it was only removed from the opening sequence.   And the Crystal Matrix was probably removed because it kind of looks like the Star of David, which most people in the Arab world know as ""the Israeli flag"" so yeah the intent was probably both religious and political."
digimon,370ekr,daniellayne,2,Sun May 24 22:31:43 2015 UTC,Parts of that actually were pretty descriptive for the series...other parts make absolutely no sense.

This was before anyone even knew that digimon could fuse together into a higher form, and WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon managed to do it on a whim, because fuck yeah, those kids believe in us!  They proceed to mop the floor with millions of Diaboromon clones, as sweet, sweet payback for pelting them with laser blasts just minutes before. And then top it off with one of the most satisfyingly brutal kills of the franchise (left intact in the dub, mind you!). Goddamn, ""Our War Game"" was awesome.  This other movie just shits all over that. Hey guys, guess what? Remember that dude who tried to cause a nuclear winter and you managed to stop him just in the nick of time? Yeah, he's back somehow. And sorry, Tai and Matt, but you guys aren't the heroes since this is for the second season, so we're going to give this one to Davis again.

At that point, I'm just thinking, ""Alright, finish this up so we can cue Smash Mouth."""
digimon,371q66,Labrynna,9,Sun May 24 01:21:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it doesn't really get good until Myotismon starts wrecking shit in the real world. Before that, I think it's ep. 21; the one where Tai and Koromon end up back in the kids' hometown for a day. It helps that the episode was directed by the same guy who did the movies.  But yeah, once the stakes get higher and we have digimon fulfilling prophecies of the Book of Revelations, that's when the first series really hits its stride. Before that it's setting up the characters, and doing your standard monster-of-the-week formula."
digimon,371q66,Sea-Salt,8,Sun May 24 14:49:35 2015 UTC,In my opinion the first few episodes arent so great but it gets better. But frontier is my favorite season so what do i know :D
digimon,371q66,yiyopuga,3,Sun May 24 03:52:27 2015 UTC,"There's four arcs: Devimon, Etemon, Myotismon and Dark Masters. Devimon is good, but each episode basically only exists to introduce a new champion level Digimon and a new bad guy. The Etemon one has a few good episodes thrown in, but really picks up at the end of it. From there on out, it's amazing."
digimon,371q66,IAMA_MAGIC_8BALL_AMA,2,Sun May 24 20:14:59 2015 UTC,Gotta love that (Spoiler): METALGREYMON!
digimon,371q66,hoilori,14,Sun May 24 21:14:14 2015 UTC,watching the english dub   And there's your problem.  There's literally zero reason to watch the dub unless you have nostalgia for it. Go find a torrent of the original with good subtitles if Netflix has bad ones.
digimon,371q66,Romiress,5,Sun May 24 01:34:04 2015 UTC,"This is probably the reason. Usually sub vs dub arguments are really just preference, but Adventure's English dub doesn't just change the music, it also changes and dumbs down the dialogue and dumbs down character arcs ""for the kids"".  If it's not the subs after all, I think that Adventure picks up after you get to know each character, which is when they can start with character development in the show.  You can probably easily find a torrent for it, it's not like Toei Animation still sells Adventure DVDs"
digimon,371q66,Giulls,-6,Sun May 24 01:45:22 2015 UTC,I just don't like having to read my anime. Can't they redub the series?
digimon,371q66,ChronaMewX,6,Sun May 24 01:39:14 2015 UTC,Uh... could they? Yes. Are they going to? Hell no. Redubbing costs boatloads of money.
digimon,371q66,Romiress,3,Sun May 24 01:41:26 2015 UTC,"Looking past nostalgia the Devimon arc (episode 1-13) is decent at best and the Etemon arc (14-20) is terrible. It only really begins picking up from episode 21 and forth, and even then there are a few stinkers here and there in the Miyotismon arc.   On top of that the dub is a bit shaky, I don't think all of the voice actors do a bad job but it's the dialog which really grind my gears, which is obvious as the show was originally geared towards children. If you really dislike the dub then go for subs instead.  I think if you didn't grow up with the show it's never going to hold a special place in your heart like it does for us who did grow up with it, but regardless it does turn into a good show eventually, try and stick with it for a while."
digimon,371q66,Masterofknees,3,Sun May 24 18:47:46 2015 UTC,"The first 13 episodes are purely for introduction, getting to the champion level, and establishing the roles of each character. After that the story starts developing, but like many have said, episode 21 (you'll know when you get there because the animation is the most memorable from the whole series) is when the mood of the series just turns around and really gets GOOD. Myotismon and Dark Masters arcs still give me anxiety and feels 15 years later, lol."
digimon,371q66,emichux3,5,Mon May 25 00:18:55 2015 UTC,"I personally love the dub. It's not digimon without terrible puns.  But that's neither here or bear. Anyways, yeah, Adventure is kinda REALLY SLOW up until about they start collecting tags and crests. Xros/Fusion feels worse though. At least adventure didn't have minutes-long digivolution cutscenes that they NEVER FUCKING SHORTEN SHOUTMON I HATE YOU JUST DIGIVOLVE LIKE A NORMAL 'MON"
digimon,371q66,Mattarias,2,Sun May 24 06:12:51 2015 UTC,Adventure becomes really good at Episode 25-30ish
digimon,371q66,SSJ5Gogetenks,2,Sun May 24 05:55:30 2015 UTC,"Gave you +1 to counter any negative feedback for stating your opinion.  IMO the first arc picks up a little bit after the first round of evolutions, the ending of the arc is solid. Second arc I personally find less interesting and then episode 21 happens, which is one of the best episode of the series. Make sure to watch this one subbed though, dub doesn't do it justice.  After that you've to wait few more episodes until the next big bad guy shows up for the show to get consistently good.  Hopefully this helps a bit."
digimon,371q66,zsmg,2,Sun May 24 15:31:51 2015 UTC,The myotismon arc is the best in adventures in my opinion. It does get so intense
digimon,371q66,DoubleOhFour,2,Mon May 25 21:48:12 2015 UTC,"Everyone else has pointed out that Adventure is really slow to start and its definitely true.  You gotta remember, this was the first introduction for many kids in North America to digimon.  Without the cards, games, or toys it was exciting just to see what the next champion looked like.    Tamers definitely capitalizes on the fact that Digimon was well-known by that point."
digimon,371q66,IncogM,0,Tue May 26 13:19:24 2015 UTC,"Digimon always starts getting miles better with episode 21. The only exception so far is Xros Wars. I actually hated watching Frontier during the first 20 Episodes but after that sh*t gone crazy! Really loved the rest of the season.  Also if you got no nostalgia for the dub, don't watch the Dub. Netflix subs are terrible so I would recommend you searching for a good subber group. I would name you one but the German dub was actually good, with a german equivalent of Brave Heart and Butterfly, original OST and less pun heavy script, so I never had to search for one."

digimon,36zanm,Wyietsayon,3,Sat May 23 12:23:33 2015 UTC,"Those are from the Digimon Collectible Card Game, which came out about the same time that the show started airing here.  I never quite understood how the game was played, and I just collected them for fun, and to see all these digimon that never actually appeared in any of the anime series.  As already said before, you probably won't get much for them if you attempt to sell them. They weren't as lucrative as the Pokemon cards, and it's really not hard to find unopened starter sets floating around on eBay and the like. They're still nice collector's items, though."

digimon,36xubf,Romiress,1 point,Sat May 23 02:56:15 2015 UTC,"Well, I meant by giving the Digital World a name based off what it is made of.  They could have done it, since like he said, they do have named areas, ""File Island"", ""Server Continent"", ""Infinity Mountain.""  I find it odd that the digimon decided to call their planet ""the digital world"" instead of giving it a formal name."
digimon,36xubf,ydoccian,1 point,Sat May 23 03:41:13 2015 UTC,"Names are names. It shouldn't be called X or Y. It's called what they like to call it.  Extraterrestial life that is aware of our planet surely doesn't call it Earth, specially if there's dirt in their own planet."
digimon,36xubf,ReiBob,3,Sat May 23 16:04:27 2015 UTC,"The term ""world"" isn't something we usually use to describe a planet but a place where life is happening. If this life is mostly isolated from each other, we tend to see it as different world. The Americas for example would've been a completly different world for the Romans at their time. But as time grows, humanity melted together so that ""our"" world now is basically planet earth. However, what happens to ""our world"" once we enter the interplanetar or interstellar space age? Our definition of ""our world"" would most likely shift towards a collection of planets or even start systems. And we might even find different worlds, of other species. Ultimatly, the whole Universe is ""the world"" we live in.  So what does that mean for the Digital World? First of all we have to understand that the Digital Universe isn't just the planet (whose name is unknown) the story plays on, but probably a lot more. However, these places are unknown to the Digimon (we came in contact with), so they don't spend a lot of time thinking about it. Their world is their planet or the area they live in. And as there is nothing within their knowledge they need to differentiate their planet from, they don't have need for a name other than ""Digital World"". ""Why Digital then?"" some of you may ask now, and the answer is quite simple. At least some Digimon are aware that there are other worlds/universes/dimensions beside the one they live in (3628800 to be exact) - and this knowledge existed for at least 6000 digital years (-> the 4 earth years between the events in Hikarigaoka and Adventure) so at least the name had quite a bit of time to become adopted by the majority of the population.  So far the ""Meta"" explaination. The real reason is probably that no writer thought about it, that nobody came up with a name that wasn't cringeworthy or nobody thought it would be nesseccary. ;)"

The thing that bothers me about the pets is that there's some evolutionary paths that you can only get by purposefully messing up your Digimon... it doesn't feel right. I much prefer Digimon World's paths based on stats, but that requires, you know, having stats."
digimon,36uexe,TheDarkFiddler,1 point,Fri May 22 14:41:47 2015 UTC,"I only have three stats at the moment, but depending on how testing goes, I could add more. I put some information about how the stats work in the main post."

It'll take some time to tell how the data/vaccine/virus stat works out, but it's an interesting way of handling it for sure. My only request right now is that if you do keep over/underweight, care mistakes, etc. as a requirement for some Digimon, don't make it make your Digimon inherently weaker. It'd really suck to have your favorite Digimon be all but always inferior to another simply because it's stuck behind being forced to be obese."
digimon,36uexe,DanSantos,3,Sat May 23 00:47:03 2015 UTC,"This is great! To be honest, I'd like to see a Vpet app for the Pebble. It's hardware faintly resembles the old Digimon Vpet.   What I like in vpets: choice of food, maybe grooming, of course training. I also liked the bitmap look of the old devices. Maybe retro-fit the feel with 32-bit sprites? Clear but still pixelated.   Don't like: clutter on the screen, but also not too much open space. Some vpets on smartphones use a lot of props likes toys and clothes. Personally, I think it's silly.   What I'd like to see here, is connectivity to other people's phones or smart devices to battle and trade.   I have a Mac, Linux, iPhone, and Android, and would love to test for you!"
digimon,36uexe,DanSantos,1 point,Fri May 22 15:47:22 2015 UTC,"How would you like the food choice to affect gameplay? Do you mean only aesthetic differences, or variables such as nutrition and like/dislike? Also, what do you mean by grooming?  I'm not much of an artist, so I'll probably be sticking with the classic Vpet pixels. I also want to capture the feel of those originals as much as possible while also building on some of the gameplay features."
digimon,36uexe,EmeraldJirachi,2,Fri May 22 19:13:53 2015 UTC,"I think nutrition and dislike. The vpets had meat and vitamins, but maybe add more variables that impact their growth in some way.   Grooming as in maybe cleaning? The originals had the user clean poop. But maybe we could be more interactive with the ""body"" of the pet. Trim hair, give baths, brush teeth. Those sorts of things.   Yeah, I'd love to see the old pixel models. Maybe add some color, though!"

digimon,36uexe,YassineDieBelg,2,Fri May 22 19:33:04 2015 UTC,"This is a fantastic idea! I have wanted a version of the virtual pets for a while now. Sorry in advance this won't be formatted well- I am on my phone.   I played the 1997 virtual pet, along with the pedometer based digivice, D-3, and D-tectorial, as well as Digimon World. Here are my thoughts on things I wished went better with these:   -the biggest thing that would frustrate me in any of these was when the battery would die and we'd lose all progress - a big reason I'd be a fan of the mobile. Even adding to that, how doable would it be to implement some sort of basic password system, such that those who got a particular step count or digimon could pick up where they left off if they have to change phones or something? While a bit of a pain in the development stage, this would make it more likely someone would play longer, as opposed to some setback just making them not want to come back and regain lost progress. I have a D-3 I still use, and I have been trying to get it to 1,000,000 steps for years, only to get frustrated when the battery dies.    the classic virtual pet look just doesn't get old. Later games would make the sprites more complex, but I really enjoyed the pixelated sprites that you can see in the original virtual pet.    -I think the easiest way to get a lot of people involved - albeit probably another very arduous task on your part in development - would be to include as many digimon as possible. My personal favorite digimon is DemiDevimon (I'd always imagine that one as my partner growing up), and I know I would pay money if my partner could be on my phone whenever I wanted.   -in Digimon World, the most frustrating thing was trying to get a certain evolution path, and having no idea why it wasn't working. The guides available when the game came out either weren't accurate to begin with or the stats had other arbitrary or unknown   variables that affected them. The two best ideas I have to get around this would be either to make it as formulaic as possible, with a large margin of error (something challenging if you are trying to be inclusive with species), or do the password system suggested above, so they only need to get it once and can then have the same digimon again later if they want. Passwords would also be great because the people who like the challenge and randomness could opt in or out at any time, while those customizing could also have their options.    the events based on the pedometer were great as a kid as a way to get me off the couch and moving. This would be great on a mobile app because it would be harder to cheat, and also have connectivity with other people more easily. Imagine saving the world with your best friend when one is in another state!

digimon,36uexe,Mausar,2,Fri May 22 19:30:14 2015 UTC,"I mean jogress. With evolution path oversight I meant something like an evolutiontree to see which digimon evolves into. A shematic to see which digimons you had hatched before, the digimons that aren't hatched or digivolved have an shadowed sprite.   Sorry man my english is not the best."

digimon,36r7ck,Graizen,13,Thu May 21 14:00:49 2015 UTC,"I wish it could happen, but it's unlikely. Digimon isn't popular enough to warrant them being in smash bros. At least we still have that rumble game, which was essentially Digimon smash bros. It was pretty fun from what I remember."
digimon,36r7ck,Wyietsayon,5,Thu May 21 15:21:38 2015 UTC,"Under the ""why"" field, I actually put that the inclusion of Marth/Roy back in the day caused a huge uptick in Fire Emblem's popularity in the US and posited that Agumon might be able to do the same for Digimon."
digimon,36r7ck,PopeJP22,3,Thu May 21 16:36:31 2015 UTC,"The difference is that FE was new, uncharted territory that ended up yielding direct profit for Nintendo in the west.

digimon,36r7ck,biggest_dreamer,2,Thu May 21 20:09:56 2015 UTC,"They already have access, most modern Digimon games have moved to Nintendo.  Edit: And it's definitely a longshot either way, not saying it's viable. But it's better than ""Plzzz Nntndeeer i lik digmon"""
digimon,36r7ck,PopeJP22,2,Thu May 21 20:14:58 2015 UTC,"That's not correct, most new Digimon games are exclusive to Sony at least at launch still. And just having games on a Nintendo system doesn't mean that Nintendo would be able to use him without paying a cut to Namco-Bandai, which there really is no incentive to do when they could just as easily add an equally popular first party character and keep all the profits."

digimon,36r7ck,Animedingo,2,Fri May 22 02:56:09 2015 UTC,"First of all, its a completely different time than it was in the 90s and early 2000s  Second, theres a difference between fire emblem being in smash before we got fire emblem games, and digimon getting added as dlc.   Japan had FE before they got melee. So naturally they would get added.   Digimon has been in the west for 2 and a half decades, and it does poorly in the west compared to Japan.   Now yes, digimon is much more successful in Japan, but Nintendo is much more globally aware then they were 15 years ago."
digimon,36r7ck,user2338,1 point,Fri May 22 03:06:36 2015 UTC,"But don't you think if Agumon was in smash it would bring new people to digimon and we might get games in the west again, now I know what doesn't seem like it would benefit Nintendo but maybe Nintendo and Namco could work a deal like SEGA and Nintendo just did"
digimon,36r7ck,Animedingo,2,Fri May 22 17:32:57 2015 UTC,"But that's just it, it wouldn't benefit Nintendo. Agumon wouldn't get picked because of the lack of global recognition, and because Nintendo has nothing to gain from it.   In comparison, look at Isaac from Golden Sun, a Nintendo published game that has less fans than Digimon, but people want him more than Agumon because not only is it realistic, it could inspire a new Golden Sun game, which would benefit Nintendo.   The only way I can realistically see Agumon getting put into Smash Bros, is if Bandai paided Nintendo to do it, and even then I suspect they wouldn't accept it."

My family went to Blockbuster because I would always want to rent Digimon World 1 (I bought it after a few weeks of renting it). They had the most beautiful digimon toys. Play figures and huge bins full of plushes. They had all of the in-training 'mons from the team. I remember picking up a Tanemon one and really wanting it, but then I saw something shiny and walked away because that is the type of person I am."
digimon,36sr74,MrHighway49,21,Thu May 21 20:42:41 2015 UTC,I personally thought it was one of the best seasons. It deviates from the standard style of the other series but it is still amazing. I say give it a shot. It can't hurt!
digimon,36sr74,xeqtioner0,3,Thu May 21 20:47:23 2015 UTC,"What is the general ""plot"" to the show?"" like are the kids still ""digidestined"" or something along those lines?"
digimon,36sr74,likeagrapefruit,12,Thu May 21 20:53:51 2015 UTC,"They are still called ""Chosen Children""/""Digidestined,"" but rather than have Digimon partners (aside from a few companions who don't battle), they come to possess the Legendary Spirits which allow them to undergo Spirit Evolution and become Hybrid Digimon. Armed with these Spirits, they must stop Cherubimon's forces from taking over the Digital World."

digimon,36sr74,Prelives1993,11,Thu May 21 21:30:04 2015 UTC,"It's worth a try, I liked it a lot, the English theme song gets me every time, I still get goosebumps listening to it"
digimon,36sr74,thecastroregime,7,Fri May 22 14:04:22 2015 UTC,"It's one of my favorite seasons. People give it a lot of flak for taking away the whole partner/digimon relationship, but honestly, I didn't even miss it. It makes up for it with awesome character development, fairly frequent new spirit evolutions, and good plot (well, at least up until the last arc--thankfully the last arc is only a lesser fraction of the whole season).  Some people also don't like the whole Super Sentai theme to it, but I'm a giant Sentai/PR fan so I absolutely loved it. And the theme song is A+"
digimon,36sr74,Sagotomi,5,Fri May 22 16:42:12 2015 UTC,"It's my number three i think it's pretty damn awesome, its a bit of a jump but less so than with savers, i just imagine them like permanently bio-merged or digimon power rangers as a little joke"
digimon,36sr74,KrytenKoro,4,Fri May 22 04:52:05 2015 UTC,"If your favorite parts about Digimon were focusing on the setting, the strange new world, the emotional development of the characters, you'll love it.  If your favorite parts were the bond beween child and Digimon, or digivolving into new, different forms, it will not be your cup of tea.  Personally, I loved it. It's pretty much the only season where the plot was cohesive from start to finish, instead of being ""oh we defeated the villain, it turns out there's another villain who has politely waited until -right this second- to start doing anything"". The first three seasons, and Data Squad as well, were all really bad about the villains wanting to focus on their vacation days instead of taking over the world."
digimon,36sr74,BijutsuYoukai,3,Sat May 23 19:33:06 2015 UTC,"I would recommend it. Digimon Frontier was probably my favorite of the various series. Despite not having digimon partners/laddered digivolutions, all the digimon involved where pretty cool to me, especially the beast forms, and I still don't get why it seems less popular than the others."
digimon,36sr74,Takuya813,3,Sun May 24 18:47:24 2015 UTC,Frontier is awesome. I rank it up there with 01/02 and Tamers for sure.   Give it a go-- I was hooked at the first episode

digimon,36sr74,ColdSnapSP,2,Fri May 22 04:00:42 2015 UTC,It was definitely good in terms of plot and character development but takes too much away from the element of digimon we love - having humans and digipartners

digimon,36pt8u,Orannis0,2,Thu May 21 08:59:38 2015 UTC,"Some clarifications: It's based on a model ripped directly from the PSP game, with a few touch-ups to make it actually 3D-printable. Feedback is appreciated!   Source to the original model: https://www.yobi3d.com/v/CS09dKetAf/ID02671_00000000out.obj  The key differences are the ellipsoid buttons and ""antenna"" base, notice how jagged these areas are- that makes them unprintable as these areas are non-physical. So I fixed them a bit, with mixed results in my opinion but you're welcome to think otherwise :)"
digimon,36oycc,kerrsace,2,Wed May 20 23:50:00 2015 UTC,"There are two cheap options:  Digimon Mini Xros Wars and Digimon Neo  Digimon Mini Xros Wars is a physically smaller Vpet and doesn't do traditional evolution, since its based off of Xros Wars.  They can only connect to other Xros Minis. You can get them for around 20 USD.  Digimon Neo is more like a digivice with quests and you don't have to take care of the digimon. (No feeding and stuff.)  These are pretty easy to get for less than 30 USD.  They're not exactly like other digivices.  I've heard they're pretty quickly paced.  Your partner will be able to reach Mega before you even start the second area."
digimon,36oycc,IncogM,2,Thu May 21 00:17:07 2015 UTC,"The ICs still turn up at alright prices.  Despite the digivice appearance, they function more like a pet.  The Xros Wars Minis are misleading because Xros Wars...is not your standard Digimon show.  There's no evolution, they just cross with each other into bigger, stronger forms.  When you defeat certain enemies you can Xros with them.  With poor treatment your character can also unfuse and go down a stage -- all the way back to the base form.  Unfortunately that's about it.  If Tri was going into an actual season with a new device, we'd probably see a toy of that.  But it looks like they're going the nostalgia route, with it being a limited series, so the expensive 15th anniversary Digivice may be all we get."
digimon,36oycc,AKluthe,2,Thu May 21 02:40:19 2015 UTC,"Vpets and the games based on them are probably my favorite things about Digimon. Digimon World, Digimon World Championship--they're some of my favorite games. I remember buying one pet for around $70 five years ago (and then several others that turned out to be fakes). Haven't bought another since because they're too expensive. It's pretty disappointing.  But every once in awhile I look around online at fan alternatives to the vpet. There's a couple good ones that manage to capture most of the feel of a good one. Digimon Unlimited installs on a cellphone and is probably one of the best imitations out there. This is probably one of the most accurate imitations. Although it isn't mobile, it offers much of the same feel of the original vpets and comes with both the originals and the pendulums. It also offers the ability to easily skin the vpet background, case, and sprites.  There are a couple others hanging around the net, but those two probably pull off their attempt to capture the feel of the original vpets best.   Still, I'm somewhat disappointed by how few programs there are out there. I decided I would start writing my own, but it's a very slow process. It's coming along pretty well, but it can be overwhelming for an amateur like me. I suppose if you have any experience with coding you could give your own program a shot. It can be difficult, but it's very fun."
digimon,36oycc,theundersigned0,1 point,Thu May 21 19:05:54 2015 UTC,"I just loved carrying one around when I was a little kid, whether it was a digivice or a v-pet. Might try this new Digimon mini thing since it's pretty cheap on Amazon."

In 2001 she suffered an injury on the set of NCIS -- as reported by Deadline.com -- that left her in a state of crippling pain, unable to work or receive any treatment due to being refused workers' compensation. Now having undergone major neck surgery, with more to come in May -- can't find out when this is scheduled or if it's already happened, if anyone can please post in this thread -- she's lost some ability to speak, which is kind of important for someone who makes a big part of their living recording as a voice actress.    Please take the time to read more about her situation at the YouCaring page set up to help support her rehabilitation and therapy as she begins a difficult period of recovery.   http://www.youcaring.com/medical-fundraiser/in-desperate-need-for-temporary-medical-living-expenses-/329777    Spread the word, too.

digimon,36hixy,skwakkie,5,Tue May 19 18:54:07 2015 UTC,There is Digimon Digital Card Battle.
digimon,36hixy,Nidac_7,5,Tue May 19 14:26:31 2015 UTC,Digimon world championship still has fighting but its not player controlled.  It more focuses on the training/raising and capturing. Its not bad but it gets overwhelming with lots of digimon.
digimon,36hixy,randomdrifter54,4,Tue May 19 20:08:33 2015 UTC,"Since Digimon started off as being a virtual pet marketed for boys, it's hook was all about fighting. As skwakkie said, Digimon Racing is the least focused on fighting (but you still can attack others with your powers as you would with items in Mario Kart).  There are some apps out there that attempt to mimic the virtual pet idea with Digimon and little fighting, like Digimon PC and some adoptables websites.  I'm currently working on one that includes a Pokemon Amie-style interface (among other interactive stuff).  You could also consider the DigiMobs mod for Minecraft to be a non-fighting digimon game, even though it's a fan-made mod."
digimon,36hixy,Botanode,3,Tue May 19 23:14:56 2015 UTC,There aren't really any games that don't. Digimon has the misfortune of being a series who's promo team can't get over the success of Pokemon.
digimon,36hixy,ResidentRedMage,2,Tue May 19 13:27:35 2015 UTC,"I don't believe there are any digimon games that don't involved battling to some extent. It is a shame though there never was/isn't some kind Hey You, Pikachu-esque game for digimon. There are so many things going on with digimon I think it would've worked out well."
digimon,36hixy,BijutsuYoukai,1 point,Sun May 24 18:49:04 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that there's a single Digimon game released outside of Japan that doesn't involve combat in one way or another. The closest you might get to that is not using items in Digimon Racing, or playing Championship/World or one of the V-Pets and choosing to just train your Digimon instead of going into combat. But if you do that, you'll probably never evolve them into a desirable form."

digimon,36hixy,Xgamer4,1 point,Wed May 20 18:08:19 2015 UTC,"It's generally used to describe games like Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter, Super Smash Bros, etc. There are a few Digimon fighting games (the Rumble Arena series), but most of the others aren't usually called fighting games. That game with the Gabumon on the random island is Digimon World, and most people wouldn't even remotely classify it as a fighting game.   As for games that don't have anything like fighting, yeah, Digital Card Battle and, apparently, Digimon Racing.   For games with more of a turn-based (think Pokemon-style) fighting system, Digimon World Dusk/Dawn and Digimon World 3 would fit the bill."
digimon,36hixy,Botanode,1 point,Wed May 20 20:02:10 2015 UTC,"This is a good clarification, but I think OP Nyumunariya just doesn't like fighting in general (my sister is the same way...), and didn't mean to use the term, fighting, as a genre (which is an arbitrary classification in the study of games anyway)."

digimon,36gpnu,SydMontague,2,Wed May 20 00:43:06 2015 UTC,"I just measured it, it's about 3 minutes and 15 seconds and therefore by far longer than Episode 53."
digimon,36gpnu,Harpoon_Torpedo,1 point,Wed May 20 07:40:57 2015 UTC,Aha a sixth of the episode. I think the whole point of the episode was to show off every Digimon.
digimon,36gpnu,happylittlemexican,1 point,Wed May 20 13:50:00 2015 UTC,Came here just to mention episode 40. I honestly think they make the whole episode without the digivolution sequences and then ask themselves how much time they need to fill. Any that go other just happen offscreen.
digimon,36gpnu,SydMontague,2,Thu May 21 04:01:20 2015 UTC,"<10%. The longest evolution sequence that comes in my mind is 2 minutes long (at the end of Adventure) and usually there are fewer evolutions per episode. Would be a interesting job for someone with too much freetime and a spotwatch, though. ;)"
digimon,36gpnu,KillerChicken48,2,Tue May 19 08:29:26 2015 UTC,"It seems to be a time filler usually, if they have extra time they need to fill, youll notice the full digivolving scene multiple tiems for multiple digimon, where as more action filled episodes they will do 2-8 at once or sometimes skip a step of the screen just to get more into the episode"
digimon,36gpnu,disneywizard,1 point,Wed May 20 07:05:36 2015 UTC,"I think episode 40, with the digivolution sequence of 3 minutes and 15 seconds, has to be the longest sequence in the franchise."

digimon,36gg88,Myxozoa,4,Wed May 20 13:31:33 2015 UTC,It's my favorite season because I liked that they were in the real world more than the digital world. Is that blasphemy? As a kid it was more relatable than getting lost in another world and going into survivor mode like in Adventure.
digimon,36gg88,m1nty,2,Fri May 22 10:30:43 2015 UTC,Alot of people like it but there is ALOT bad with it
digimon,36gg88,Sagotomi,3,Fri May 22 04:52:50 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there is. I haven't watched it since I was 8 and it was on the air, so I've got some pretty thick nostalgia goggles on. I just remember I was on the verge of tears when they showed everyone all grown up and successful in the finale. I felt like my friends had left me behind."
digimon,36gg88,Myxozoa,6,Fri May 22 04:56:18 2015 UTC,"A more long term reason: Digimon Tri is coming soon. It's a continuation of Adventure 1 for sure but it's not clear at all how much, if any, of Adventure 2 is going to be built upon. It might be ignored or retconned to hell or Tri might follow right where Adventure 2 leaves off. I think for this reason you should watch it, just in case."
digimon,36gg88,SometimesY,5,Wed May 20 00:11:51 2015 UTC,Yeah I was thinking about that.
digimon,36gg88,Giulls,5,Wed May 20 00:22:12 2015 UTC,"Your best bet is to try to watch it before Tamers. It has some of the characters you just finished watching so it will make it more enjoyable if you watch it now and not later.  Although the first and third seasons are better, 02 has a number of fairly decent episodes and arcs that are worth watching the whole season for."
digimon,36gg88,Timbolt759,5,Tue May 19 06:49:20 2015 UTC,Adventure 02 isn't awful and does have it's decent moments. The second story arc is certainly worth a watch the villains are well written (well the important ones are). It isn't as good but yeah like as other people have said watch it before you go to tamers.
digimon,36gg88,aDigifanmon,6,Tue May 19 18:37:11 2015 UTC,"Being honest here, Digimon 02 has flaws, plot holes, some really undeveloped/shallow characters and generally it seemed like the writers didn't know in what direction to go. The plot is less coherent and the pacing isn't as good as in the first season.  But:   it continues Adventure, so you should see what happens next to the digidestined and the Digitalworld there are some really good episodes and characters. I guess there are some that can be considered the best of all Digimon seasons. Some villains in particular are complex and sympathetic (and not ""I want to destroy things because I'm EVIL!!""). Some season arcs are interesting but the execution could be better.   Related to 1., have you watched the movies? If not I recommend you. Link in the sidebar with order. I think seeing the originals subbed is better as the dubbed movie joins several pre and post 02 movies, but you can stop watching when a different part starts."
digimon,36gg88,califexe,-3,Wed May 20 01:32:35 2015 UTC,No way would I watch the Dub of anything digimon lol.
digimon,36gg88,califexe,5,Wed May 20 05:18:22 2015 UTC,"The first half of 02 is basically new kids, led by bargain-bin Taichi Daisuke saving the Digital world as an after-school hobby, while the older kids look on between school and club time, with little easter-eggies to Digivolve into two forms each, before evolving for real halfway through the series when they go on a world tour on an international meet-and-greet with other Digidestined peeps all over the world under the pretense of a global digital catastrophe.  With the memories of the shows behind me, I would've rather skipped it and gone straight to the universally beloved Digimon Tamers, but for completion's sake, maybe you should give Digimon Adventure 02 a shot."
digimon,36gg88,Tomhap,1 point,Tue May 19 05:06:52 2015 UTC,I will probably watch it eventually.  I kinda think I might just go to tamers then go back and watch 02 after?
digimon,36gg88,SydMontague,8,Tue May 19 05:28:10 2015 UTC,"No no no, trust me. After the spectacular Digimon Tamers, you won't want to go back to 02. You're better off just getting it done with first, since you're on a continuity roll with Adventure."
digimon,36gg88,happylittlemexican,3,Tue May 19 06:01:28 2015 UTC,I suppose I might as well go through 02 first then lol.
digimon,36gg88,thecastroregime,3,Tue May 19 06:31:12 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone, this is my first time in this subreddit, could anyone explain to me why they hated/loved 02/tamers? I watched 02 when it originally aired in the Netherlands and loved it, though maybe the first arc took a bit too long where it was just about taking down the towers.  I watched the english dub of Tamers much later when I got back into it and didn't think much of it. Especially the 'mascotte' character that just screamed kawaii merchandise that became somewhat of a deus ex at the end of it.  Also, I probably didn't notice them when I was younger, but what were the plot holes in 02 exactly?"
digimon,36gg88,OneLameStabber,1 point,Fri May 22 20:40:30 2015 UTC,"Welcome in this subreddit. ;)  Many plot holes for 02 were listed here: http://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/34o08v/what_are_the_digimon_season_2_plot_holes/ (There should be a few more topics about that in this subreddit)  As for Tamers. Many people consider Tamers the best Digimon season, the other half claims that for Adventure (I say they're both right). If you have troubles to understand why, I recommend you to watch the original with subtitles (or a dub close to it), as that's is the standpoint many people use for their opinion and US dub and sub differ quite a bit at places (e.g. the music is completly different). If you didn't get warm with the US dub, you might get warm with the sub. ;)  Edit: Do you want wings? ;) (Sorry, I love this scene)"
digimon,36gg88,SydMontague,2,Fri May 22 22:44:10 2015 UTC,"I would say watch it ""passively."" Like, have it playing (dub, of course, so you can do this) while you do something else. You can pay just enough attention to get the good out of it but not enough to absolutely cringe."
digimon,36gg88,blackfyre_pretender,0,Wed May 20 02:52:06 2015 UTC,I just can't listen to the Dub it gets on my nerves.  I only really watch subs most of the time.
digimon,36gg88,Sagotomi,2,Wed May 20 05:17:33 2015 UTC,"You should definitely watch it now. 02 is one of the weaker seasons for sure, but that doesn't mean it's bad. It's still certainly entertaining, even if it does have some plot holes. For the sake of example, let's just say all the other seasons are 5/5, and 02 is just 4/5. Sure, not as good, but definitely still watching.  Disclaimer: I'm not actually rating every other season a 5/5 or 02 a 4/5. That's just for the sake of explaining a point."

digimon,36f9ze,likeagrapefruit,2,Mon May 18 23:20:19 2015 UTC,Did you notice any major difference in the story though? I'm at episode 20 subbed and really not enjoying it but I'd heard there was a difference in the story or certain things that were explained poorly in the english version. I do want to re-watch Adventure before Tri comes out and I don't want to miss anything but I'm really not enjoying the subbed episodes. Is there any reason to carry on with subbed or should I just rewatch the dub from here on?
digimon,36f9ze,likeagrapefruit,2,Mon May 18 23:26:40 2015 UTC,"If memory serves, the general story was similar enough to that of the Japanese version. That said, if you want to be sure that you'll understand what's happening in Tri in Japanese, you'll probably still want to continue watching it subbed just in case."
digimon,36f9ze,SydMontague,1 point,Mon May 18 23:35:15 2015 UTC,"If you don't want to take the chance to miss any reference, stay with the sub. Otherwise, stay with the sub, too. The story is just way better told in the original version (especially thanks to the music and the lack of puns...).  (personal opinion)"
digimon,36f9ze,emichux3,1 point,Tue May 19 00:05:14 2015 UTC,"I get lack of puns but I really liked that intro music and the fight song that sounded similar to it. Also the 'sad music' from the dub I thought was amazing. But yeah I do see what you (and many others seem to be) saying about more detail and better storytelling in the original. Pity... I did kinda like the dub, aaanyway"
digimon,36f9ze,Animal31,5,Tue May 19 00:17:58 2015 UTC,"I'm doing the same as you. I'm on episode 32, but I have skipped around to watch the heavily edited episodes in the past. Right now is the first time I'm watching the whole series chronologically in Japanese. I grew up completely with the dub, know of all the ""deleted scenes"", and have every episode on VHS recorded so I've watched it tons and tons of times.   I'm kind of in your boat, while I do enjoy the subbed version extremely, especially since the music sets a completely different tone, I'm still very very fond of the dub. And in reality, the story is still 90% the same. I know some personalities are altered a bit, and really the biggest edit is the music, but the important thing I got from watching the dub were the lessons each episode taught, growing attached and loving each character, and just getting to be a part of the story.   Looking back at what we had and what the original was, the story was edited to be told in a very ""American"" way. Certain scenes I watch now I fear would've turned me off as a kid. The second half of Adventure just gets very dark, which of course helps the audience grow with the kids, but 11 year old me would've cringed and been scared. Some of the stupid puns and jokes helped lighten up the mood in the dub, and are even inside jokes between my friends and I now. Also this was a time when Anime culture wasn't big in the US yet! Technically Digimon is what really got me into anime and Japanese culture, so while not perfect, I'm happy that the series got picked up for me to watch on Saturday mornings.  A few years back I also had the pleasure of getting to meet and talk with Jeff Nimoy at one of my local conventions, and there were things that Fox just wouldn't allow them to show, so instead they tried to have some fun with it. There wasn't much you could do if a network wouldn't allow you :P  SO I guess my answer is, if I'm feeling nostalgic and watching with my friends (or I'm drunk/high/being silly, etc.) I will pick the dub. But if I want to ""watch anime"" and feel like engrossing myself in a more serious story, I watch the original with subs."
digimon,36f9ze,Wyietsayon,6,Tue May 19 19:07:33 2015 UTC,Dub for life
digimon,36f9ze,textposts_only,2,Tue May 19 00:01:21 2015 UTC,"Just recently watching the sub for the first time too. I like both. The dub, yeah nostalgia reasons, but also I like some of the extra fluff dialogue. Stupid jokes, talking about the different ways they like their eggs, just small stuff. But the sub is better overall I feel. Scenes make more sense, things flow better, and the character growths feels more natural, not forced. Plus, with the exception of a few parts, the sound design in the sub is more powerful."
digimon,36f9ze,Wyietsayon,1 point,Mon May 18 23:40:24 2015 UTC,Wait the bit about eggs wasn't in there originally?
digimon,36f9ze,SydMontague,1 point,Sun May 24 18:33:01 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah, but it was done different. In the sub, it's there to serve a point in Joe's plotline, so it feels very constructed that way. In the dub, it's more aimless and free and to me feels like a slice of life, a chance to breathe in each character's personalities more. Technically, the sub better used it for the whole story, but I like the sigh of relief version of the dub's version as well."
digimon,36f9ze,SydMontague,2,Sun May 24 18:52:47 2015 UTC,"I really like Digimon for it's story, details and music and sadly these things got removed or changed quite a lot in the US dub, making it for me, used to another dub, unwatchable.  In my opinion the US dub failed miserably in dubbing. After all, a dub is supposed to localize - that means keeping everything intact, but make it understandable in another language - and not to reinterpret it. And even from a reinterpreting standpoint, I feel the actual quality of the dub (sound design, writing, music) is quite low, compared to the original. I really don't like the US dub and think it did great harm to the franchise itself, but to be fair, as a german I have no reason (and no nostalgia) to watch the US dub anyways.  About the german dub... It's good. They kept everything intact and just translated it. The voice acting is good, the translation is (as far as I can tell) good and nothing got censored or altered (except names the for marketing reasons). But still, the japanese original plays on another level. Japanese voice acting is on a level, the rest of the world can't compete with easily - especially for a ""kids show"", which doesn't get the same dubbing budget as a AAA Holywood movie. There is one exception, though. I prefer the german lyrics for the songs - but that probably because they are a) the ones I understand, b) the ones I can sing along and c) the ones I have nostalgia for.  Btw. ""dub vs sub"" isn't only a matter for anime - especially when you live in a non english country you often have to decide between the original and the localized version. And from my experience, the original is usually way better. Problems usually occur when you're used to the dub and then switch as you have problems you recognize the voices in the beginning, but you get used to it. ;)"
digimon,36f9ze,textposts_only,2,Mon May 18 23:59:40 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize there was much dubbing being done. When I was in Denmark (and Germany for that matter) the people I was staying with said their kids just watched everything in english with subtitles because there were more shows made in English than in their native language (not sure how accurate that is but sounds likely) and made no mention of dubs being available. The only dubbed live action things I know of are kung-fu movies.  Anyway, thanks for such a detailed response, I kinda see what you mean about how seriously they take voice acting in Japan."
digimon,36f9ze,SydMontague,1 point,Tue May 19 00:16:00 2015 UTC,"I can only speak for germany, but almost everything get dubbed here. Even when they show something subbed/original (what rarely happens in TV outside of PayTV), there is or will be a dubbed version of it available.   I assume the other big lanuages in europe (french, spanish, portuguese, italian) all have a dubbing culture compareable to the german one.  That's different for smaller languages/countries, though. I heard a lot, especially about the northern countires, that subbed/original content is way more common there. And it makes sense, when you consider that the costs for a german and a norwegian dub are about the same, but you can reach about 20 times more people with the german dub. It's simply not economical to create dubs."
digimon,36f9ze,blackfyre_pretender,0,Tue May 19 00:49:35 2015 UTC,So German dub all the way?
digimon,36f9ze,SydMontague,1 point,Sun May 24 18:36:33 2015 UTC,Nah - sub all the way except for the songs. For the songs I simply have too much nostalgia - but in fact it doesn't matter as the melody stays the same and I can perfectly sing along in german to the japanese versions. ;)
digimon,36f9ze,blackfyre_pretender,2,Sun May 24 18:48:04 2015 UTC,"The only ones that I've watched both the sub and dub for are Adventure and 02, and I think that there's not really that much of a difference between them. Mostly the more mature content has been edited out for the American dub (things like references to Digimon dying, and Pinnochimon's pistol). If you're not enjoying the sub, don't force yourself. You can find all the Japanese names and such online."
digimon,36f9ze,SydMontague,-2,Tue May 19 11:22:01 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but ""not much of a difference"" while they replaced the whole music? oO"

digimon,36f9ze,Quill-,-4,Tue May 19 12:04:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah okay, the overall story stays the same, but the way it is told differs to a great extend."
digimon,36f9ze,axelofthekey,5,Tue May 19 12:31:43 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched the English versions in a while, but from what I remember, aside from the corny jokes it's just a matter of some things being sort of glazed over (for instance, Davis knowing Arukenimon's name in the dub before he should)."
digimon,36f9ze,zsmg,2,Tue May 19 12:45:51 2015 UTC,"Sub, since the dub in my country was dubbed from the original Japanese script and not the American one."

digimon,365kok,Andrew13112001,34,Sat May 16 10:25:28 2015 UTC,Wouldn't Flying/Fairy be more appropriate for Patamon's last evolutions? Most of the attacks that I remember are Light/Holy.  edit: grammar
digimon,365kok,CorvosKK,30,Sat May 16 13:00:59 2015 UTC,"I'm really not sure that the line whose signature attacks include Petit Fire and Fox Fire should be Ice types... Honestly Gabumon's line is probably more like Fire, Fire, Dark/Fighting, Ice/Steel imo"
digimon,365kok,biggest_dreamer,8,Sat May 16 11:39:59 2015 UTC,"Oooh right. Haven't watched Adventure for a while, so I went mostly by design(except Tentomon line. I remembered Petit Thunder)"
digimon,365kok,jgk91,1 point,Sat May 16 11:51:31 2015 UTC,You'd have to be kidding yourself if you think that Gabumon + evolutions is fire! It would be an ice type.
digimon,365kok,biggest_dreamer,2,Sun May 17 00:48:43 2015 UTC,I'm assuming you're just saying that because they're blue? Gabumon and Garurumon have consistently used primarily fire-based attacks in every piece of media that I'm aware of.
digimon,365kok,jgk91,6,Sun May 17 04:48:13 2015 UTC,"If we're going to be literally interpreting the fictional type of a digimon based on its primary attack and not what the animal actually is (ignoring the fact that Pokemon can learn attacks that are not of its primary type), then Tentomon + evolutions would be electric only, Zudomon would be steel only and Birdramon wouldn't be a flying type, just fire.   From the Garurumon wiki page:  ""As it possesses a furious combat instinct and sinews honed in freezing lands, as well as carnivore-like agility and the accuracy to reliably bring down its targets, it is a being feared by other Digimon.""  ""The Garurumon Card is a Ice-attribute Card with 1100 HP, 350 Circle attack, 230 Triangle attack and Counter Circle.""  ""Garurumon is #093, and is a Champion-level, Attacker-class, Beast-species Digimon with a resistance to the Earth element and weakness to the Fire element.

digimon,365kok,cyvaris,1 point,Sun May 17 05:17:49 2015 UTC,They are. Fire/Ice would work better or something. I did it as Ice because I haven't watched Adventure in a while so I went after design. But they have fire attacks.

digimon,365kok,StarOriole,16,Sat May 16 12:58:20 2015 UTC,"Patamon's the same way. They're holy beasts that get ""promoted"" to actual angels when they Digivolve, I guess."
digimon,365kok,somehokie,8,Sat May 16 13:56:27 2015 UTC,"Starting from the beginning of the line, at least in the version I remember from 15 years ago, it's Mouse -> Dog -> Cat -> Angel -> Dragon. She got more advanced with each step, although Cat -> Angel is definitely a big jump. That's the sort of change we normally see in Rookie -> Champion, not Champion -> Ultimate.  Angel -> Dragon works when you think of it as Western Religion -> Eastern Religion (with Eastern obviously being favored in an anime). In this version, it seems like it's instead Angel -> Higher-Ranked Angel, which I feel doesn't fit with the constant change in her evolutionary line as much."
digimon,365kok,StarOriole,3,Sat May 16 14:00:56 2015 UTC,"Angel -> Dragon works when you think of it as Western Religion -> Eastern Religion   Or if you just consider Western religion, since some of the western angels use dragons in their imagery, including Michael, archangel who leads the army of god, who was said to slay a dragon, or more likely Samael who was said to take the form of a dragon or snake in some stories."
digimon,365kok,Animal31,1 point,Sat May 16 19:04:38 2015 UTC,"Also possible! Considering that there's Lilithmon, there's no reason they couldn't take inspiration from Samael as well."

digimon,365qxf,Botanode,1 point,Sun May 17 05:25:44 2015 UTC,"But when you think about it, a lot of the Mega Digimon have armor, so it's not weird that there'd be lots of steel types. The monsters were designed for different worlds, so when trying to transform from the Pokemon basis into a Digimon basis, a bias for steel types isn't unexpected."
digimon,365qxf,biggest_dreamer,2,Wed May 20 21:44:02 2015 UTC,Cyberdramon is one that I actually think should be Steel.
digimon,365qxf,Raptorianxd,2,Sat May 16 16:19:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm just missing something, but why is Gallantmon Fighting/Steel? Pure Steel would work, or he could keep the Fire or Dragon from his previous forms. Just seems weird to change the typing that drastically, when Steel would have sufficed, if we're going by Pokémon rules. Pokémon tend to keep at least one of their types, even when they change form drastically, as in Magikarp to Gyarados, Dragonair to Dragonite and Exeggcute to Exeggutor, to name a few."
digimon,365qxf,biggest_dreamer,1 point,Sat May 16 21:55:33 2015 UTC,"Digimon can change elemental affinity pretty drastically over their life cycle (Gabumon attacks with fire, MetalGarurumon attacks with ice), so it's understandable that there might be cases where one would go from 2 distinct hypothetical Pokemon types to 2 completely unrelated ones. They weren't designed with these sort of type affinities in mind the way that Pokemon were."
digimon,365qxf,IDBN,1 point,Sun May 17 01:21:25 2015 UTC,"I'd say that gallantmon should take on the electric type, given that his main attack is ""lightning joust"" and ""shield of the just"" makes a pretty decent charge beam."

digimon,365md2,biggest_dreamer,4,Sat May 16 15:43:40 2015 UTC,"Imperialdramon FM should be dragon/fighting, as should veemon, exveemon, and the whole veedramon line. as for silphymon and valkrymon they should be flying/fighting"
digimon,365md2,NotLockedLP,3,Sat May 16 15:54:12 2015 UTC,"I think the Angemon line is the biggest offender currently. The most obvious replacement (Holy/Light) of course doesn't exist, so I think Fairy would have to do.  I'd give the V-mon and Wormmon lines Dragon and Bug respectively, making Paildramon and Dinobeemon Dragon/Bug then Dragon/Flying and Dragon/Fighting for the two forms of Imperialdramon where the buggy parts seem to be overwritten.  I'd say the Tailmon line ought to be given Fairy typing from start to finish, and as a result Silphymon/Valkyrimon should follow suit and be Fairy/Flying.  The V-dramon line should be Dragon-Dragon-Dragon/Flying-Dragon/Fighting I think. V-mon itself could pass for Normal, but V-dramon itself absolutely has to be Dragon I think."
digimon,365md2,KazyX,1 point,Sat May 16 16:11:38 2015 UTC,"I think Silphymon and Valkyrimon could be Fighting/Flying  Ankylomon could be Ground/Dragon (it's classed as a dragon in Lost Evolution), Shakkoumon I could easily see being Steel/Psychic"
digimon,365md2,user2338,3,Sat May 16 18:45:51 2015 UTC,"Hawkmon should be Normal/Flying not pure Flying. The only pure flying pokemon is wind incarnated.  No amount of wishing will remove that Armadillomon's Ultimate is Shakkoumon and Mega Vikemon.  And really, a lot of Steel Types. Since a lot of digimon are ME, you should consider what other types would fit instead of just defaulting to Steel."
digimon,365md2,Yoshiman400,2,Sat May 16 15:19:46 2015 UTC,armadillomon really needs new  evolutions

Considering all of his evolved forms have dramon on them, it would make more sense for them to be dragon types. XV-mon - Dragon/Fighting Veedramon - Dragon/Fighting Aeroveedramon- Dragon/Flying Ullforceveedramon - Dragon/Flying  Paildramon is okay as Fighting/Bug, considering it'a a jogress, but I think Imperialdramon and Fighter mode would be Dragon/Fire or Dragon/Flying, Paladin mode being Dragon/Steel"

I also don't care for Guardromon or MarineAngemon. I wish they had gotten different partners because neither were well suited to the upcoming fights. Otherwise it's by far my favorite season.

Yes, they already got like the biggest development in this season but the development of these 2 was by far the best thing in the season and they left so many aspects of it unexplored. E.g. how they handle their discovery in the real world.  About Kenta and Hirokazu... I feel like they shouldn't have gotten a Partner in the first place. They're simply sidekicks who, IMHO, don't fullfill the requirements to be a Tamer. This could've changed by these characters being more developed - but it would've cost development time for the other characters. But the focus on a very limited set of characters is Tamers advantage over Adventure, as it allowed them to develop all protagonists pretty deep - human and Digimon alike."

I was hoping it was just not a great picture of her or something that wouldn't be an issue once she is animated and talking. Something that would disappear once her personality shines through.  I was kind of ok with Takeru and Hikari. I was expecting some large change like that, since we're used to them looking so young.

The only one with the exception was Tamers and even then, all Takato got was an armor upgrade and a steed.

digimon,35uwr0,Andrew13112001,19,Wed May 13 18:40:56 2015 UTC,Massive plothole. Just like many other things in 02...
digimon,35uwr0,SydMontague,11,Wed May 13 18:45:03 2015 UTC,"they didn't want to worry them. yes, it's a silly reason. 10-year old kids have silly reasoning.  it's only possibly a plot hole when parents of the older kids see digimon who they know are real and not toys and don't question, like one scene where Patamon sits on top of TK's head while he has a conversation with his mom, and the mom says nothing about Patamon. I read that as the parents of the original Adventure kids playing along.  but yeah, a single discussion about whether they should tell their parents or not would've made it all clearer and been interesting to see."
digimon,35uwr0,jeffinitelyjeff,2,Wed May 13 18:51:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, okay, making sure they don't worry is indeed a valid reason. However, that applies more to the new cast and less to the old ones. There is no reason to play stuffed animal in front of Koushiro's mother. She already knows 2 of the present Digimon and does indeed remember them (as she asks for Tentomon in Episode 27 - but even there they play plushy... that episode is full with plot holes...).  So yeah, there might be explainations for some things, but personally I think 02 handled this whole situation completly wrong, creating many illogical scenes and possible plot holes."
digimon,35uwr0,SydMontague,5,Wed May 13 19:22:58 2015 UTC,"for the 02 kids, it's a matter of ""don't tell them or they'll think I'm crazy and there will be negative consequences if they knew about this digimon thing"". for the Adventure kids, it's a matter of ""they think all the world-ending digimon stuff is long in the past, so don't make them worry about it again"". It's not totally illogical for the Adventure kids to hide it from their parents; the only illogical part is when the parents see the digimon and act like they're toys (again, more logically assumed to be them playing along)."
digimon,35uwr0,jeffinitelyjeff,1 point,Wed May 13 19:30:39 2015 UTC,"I thought he was speaking more along the lines of the Adventure 01 parents seemingly being completely oblivious to the Digimon in their presence, especially the Adventure 01 Digimon, whom they already know aren't toys and became friends with. Even if the kids were trying to avoid worrying thier parents, everyone acting like they don't all remember such a life altering event is illogical. Hell, the Digimon being around could have been brushed off as old friends visiting."
digimon,35uwr0,Calhoun1389,1 point,Thu May 14 10:37:34 2015 UTC,"yeah, I explained this: the most logical conclusion is that the parents are playing along.  in Adventure, Matt's dad has a line about knowing who Gabumon is when Matt mentions him, and there's all sorts of speculation about how his dad could know this and if he's connected with the digital world and whether he was a DigiDestined etc., but this contrasts with a later scene where he's super confused about Garurumon. it's the same logical conclusion: the kids think they're really good at hiding their digimon but they really aren't.  slightly less logical is if why the Adventure kids would be so stupid to think their parents would fall for seeing ""toys"" that look exactly like Digimon they met. again, it isn't much of a stretch to think that the kids would have an unrealistic view of their parents' awareness and knowledge. it's a common trope to have kid protagonists consider their parents to be oblivious and ignorant while they're actually completely aware of everything, and it seems to fit with my understanding of how kids act in real life."
digimon,35uwr0,jeffinitelyjeff,1 point,Thu May 14 10:46:09 2015 UTC,I think Matt's dad's issue can be explained by maybe he does know of the digimon or at least Gabumon but doesn't know they can change forms.

digimon,35uwr0,xeqtioner0,1 point,Wed May 13 19:12:56 2015 UTC,"I think the camping trip was to explain the weekend long disappearance of the 02 kids from their parents.  Not sure on that pic though. Tai's mom already knew her kids had digimon and went to the digital world. Maybe to hide the fact that there were more kids than before who had digimon, and that digimon were still a thing all these years later? Narratively it was using this as an visual reason why it was important that the new kids still had to hide their digimon, but yeah, it doesn't make complete sence with Tai's mom.  Then again, Tai's mom is a little airheaded. Loving, but ditsy. I mean, she fell for this digimon are stuffed animals gag, after having seen Gatomon and Patamon before..."
digimon,35uwr0,Wyietsayon,1 point,Wed May 13 18:47:39 2015 UTC,"Why would Digimon still being a thing be a problem? What would she say?  ""Taichi, stop saving the world and come take a bath"" ?"
digimon,35uwr0,Wyietsayon,1 point,Wed May 13 18:49:49 2015 UTC,"She'd just be worried for her kids. Maybe try to stop them if she feels protective and doesn't want to admit there's not much she can do to protect them. But it'd put a lot of worry on her, and maybe Tai and Kari don't want to do that. At that point, the real world hadn't been affected by the digital battles. If they succeeded in their plans that weekend, then they wouldn't have to worry their mother needlessly.  I'm also thinking of Izzy's mom, who later in the season was worried for Izzy, but she knows can't do much to help them like the other parents. So she makes snacks for them. So cute and sad."
digimon,35uwr0,Wyietsayon,1 point,Wed May 13 19:04:04 2015 UTC,Then why act like the Digimons are plushies again? What? They can't have a good time with their Digimons?
digimon,35uwr0,SydMontague,1 point,Wed May 13 19:06:08 2015 UTC,"Derp, sorry, Izzy's mom.  I dunno. It is a plot hole. I'm just trying to find thinly veiled excuses, like covering a whole in the the wall with a painting.  Maybe because last time there were digimon around, the city was in ruins and the kids were in danger? It seems somewhat reasonable to link digimon and incoming danger in those circumstances.  Then again, she'd just ask Izzy what was up, and accept whatever excuse he says, so not a good reason there.  Uh....not sure. Doesn't it explain somewhere in the episode? I thought there was some minor excuse somewhere. Maybe not."
digimon,35uwr0,Wyietsayon,1 point,Wed May 13 19:35:49 2015 UTC,"In the linked scene they're actually at Koushiro's/Izzy's place, so it's his mother, not Taichi's."

digimon,35uwr0,Sagotomi,1 point,Thu May 14 09:25:58 2015 UTC,"Another thing that's been overlooked in this thread a bit is the ""real time"" factor of 02. We don't have the hyper-accelerated time dilation in the Digital World in 02 anymore, therefore it's much more difficult to be able to go in and out at will without scaring a few people along the way. Combine that with the consistent dangers of being there (especially with a madman like Ken that needed to be settled down and fast) and running off like that suddenly becomes a real danger. /u/Wyietsayon's about the only person I've seen come close to mention it."

digimon,35qh07,KronusX7,41,Wed May 13 17:16:08 2015 UTC,The altered art actually makes me appreciate the official art more- it makes them look like the actual Asian teens they are.
digimon,35qh07,califexe,4,Tue May 12 18:00:50 2015 UTC,Thank. You. I love the new art style simply because of that. I like it when anime makes an attempt to show more accurate or true to form looks of asian people.
digimon,35qh07,TheMagistre,23,Fri May 15 20:09:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm over the anime art style, I think it's fine."
digimon,35qh07,ErkiB,4,Tue May 12 18:20:13 2015 UTC,It's an anime though
digimon,35qh07,gritodedolores1946,4,Tue May 12 23:24:54 2015 UTC,"Its still anime before however. Its just that kind of weaboo ""Desu desu!"" thing to think it needs the whole big kawaii eyes and whatever."
digimon,35qh07,DarnLemons,-8,Tue May 12 23:33:19 2015 UTC,I would just like them to be more recognizable. I just hour the show will distract me from their looks. Mimi looks like a bitch...and I don't even know what a weaboo is
digimon,35qh07,gritodedolores1946,2,Tue May 12 23:40:44 2015 UTC,"I can recognize Tai immediately even with the new art style  In fact, unless you group them up with other people drawn in the same style I could recognize all of them  I really think the only thing they need are more unique outfits and then they're fine"
digimon,35qh07,KronusX7,1 point,Wed May 13 17:16:56 2015 UTC,Maybe change Matt's eyes a bit. .
digimon,35qh07,gritodedolores1946,20,Wed May 13 17:31:10 2015 UTC,"While I like the tsuritama art style a lot, I do prefer the altered fan version. It's more recognizable and inviting. Makes my gut feel good lol."
digimon,35qh07,Pokelucelop,5,Tue May 12 21:04:56 2015 UTC,My only problem with the official art is that they have no noses.
digimon,35qh07,alberto549865,1 point,Tue May 12 22:12:36 2015 UTC,Well that's just a general problem in anime
digimon,35qh07,KronusX7,10,Wed May 13 17:20:41 2015 UTC,"If they're targeting an older demographic the current artstyle works better than trying to bring back parts of the old artstyle. Yes, it's a bit harder to recognize them but that's a necessary compromise, and besides you wouldn't expect to recognize an adult if the last time you saw the person was as a kid, most adults also had smaller eyes in the original series anyways. Also, I don't get making Sora's hair shorter when it was already growing longer in 02.  My only problem is that their outfits don't really vary, and while I do understand that it's typical high school wear in Japan I do hope they will wear something more casual and with more personality, at least a lot of the time."
digimon,35qh07,Masterofknees,3,Tue May 12 18:16:45 2015 UTC,"It's not the short or long hair that's the problem, it's that it fans out unnaturally like she's touching one of those static plasma globe things."
digimon,35qh07,recursion8,1 point,Tue May 12 22:34:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's much room for complaining about unnatural hair considering some of the hair in the original series. Animes always have whack hair, this is nothing really."

digimon,35qh07,Captain_Kuhl,4,Tue May 12 21:42:51 2015 UTC,"This is definitely welcomed    Personally, I feel that the new style isn't just static across the board (same face syndrome), but it also tries too hard to make the characters (especially Matt) look overtly edgy. While we're on the topic of Matt, oh man does he looks nothing like what that wild choppy-slick haired in 01/02 would've grown into (and why is his hair so blonde)    A lot of people are commenting that it makes them look more mature and older, and that the adults in the original animation had these kinds of eyes too     there is a difference between making characters look like older versions of themselves and making them seem like they came from a completely different person, which is what I (and many others) feel like the new designs have done they're high schoolers, not adults, so they shouldn't have adult facial structures yet anyways"
digimon,35qh07,Steve_Eggplant,16,Wed May 13 02:44:31 2015 UTC,good lord can we get over this already
digimon,35qh07,zinc_finger,10,Tue May 12 18:49:03 2015 UTC,"I personally just don't like the style they are going to be using, I never have no matter what anime it's used in.  But that is the style they are going with and I am still gonna watch the shit out of this show and love every moment of it.    Either way, the artists did nice work on the fan alterations."
digimon,35qh07,12th_companion,7,Tue May 12 20:09:40 2015 UTC,"The characters look more mature, which is important considering Tai and them are all in their late teens now, and aren't a bunch of lively kids anymore."
digimon,35qh07,godblow,3,Tue May 12 18:27:19 2015 UTC,Matt's hair is a little too blond

digimon,35qh07,gritodedolores1946,4,Tue May 12 23:24:38 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking too. The hair was the main way I recognized them. At first glance I thought Tri had all new characters
digimon,35qh07,air_asian,3,Wed May 13 00:23:04 2015 UTC,I recognized Tai because he kinda looks like he does in the movie
digimon,35qh07,gritodedolores1946,3,Wed May 13 00:26:30 2015 UTC,They're only twelve?? How old were they in 02?
digimon,35qh07,pynzrz,2,Wed May 13 14:02:32 2015 UTC,11 (in the Japanese version).
digimon,35qh07,Hydrochloric_Comment,1 point,Wed May 13 16:27:50 2015 UTC,Tri is only 1 year after?
digimon,35qh07,pynzrz,-2,Wed May 13 17:26:00 2015 UTC,They were 7 or 8 in season 1 so..and tri is a remake of 2.
digimon,35qh07,gritodedolores1946,3,Wed May 13 17:30:48 2015 UTC,uh. Tri is not a remake of 02... Unless I'm missing something...
digimon,35qh07,pynzrz,3,Wed May 13 18:07:56 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure they're supposed to be 14. Taichi, Yamato and Sora were all 14 in 02 and they're 17 now, so 3 years have passed."
digimon,35qh07,emichux3,5,Wed May 13 18:14:22 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't see much of a difference in terms of character recognizability - all the official character designs now look very distinguishable and easily recognizable as the characters from 01 and 02.   The fan alterations are more stylistic preference than anything, and I do appreciate that. They certainly look happier in the fan alteration. :P"
digimon,35qh07,BTrumbl,5,Tue May 12 19:33:37 2015 UTC,I like the old style better. It looks more like how the previous seasons looked. I don't want to watch digimon that looks like every single Japanese anime on the market where the characters just look... Bleh.

digimon,35teb3,Giraffesarecool123,3,Sun May 17 08:46:59 2015 UTC,"Same. The artwork doesn't look promising either, but who knows the art in the show itself might look different from the one teaser picture we have right now. But between the delay, the announcement that it's movies instead of a season, and the poor artwork we've seen so far, I'm shitting myself a bit. That all does not bode very well.

digimon,35sp53,DigitaruWarudo,6,Wed May 13 13:08:01 2015 UTC,"'Diversity' in anime means a different thing from 'Diversity' in America. Japan is very ethnically homogeneous. They already had a very prominent minority (Li Jianlliang is not a 'Japanese' character) in S3.  If you're talking about the male/female split, highly unlikely to change. Digimon was (and still is, although less with Tri) at young boys."
digimon,35sp53,Romiress,3,Wed May 13 04:45:44 2015 UTC,"This won't happen. This is a ""kid/boy"" franchise, with a specific target market (japan) that is struggling with issues like racism and xenophobia. The best you could expect from Digimon is an immigrant character (Tamers) or a main character that is a girl, or a girl/boy combo a la Taichi/Yamato."
digimon,35sp53,Dial595Escape,2,Wed May 13 19:32:44 2015 UTC,"A usual part of Digimon RPs is that the Digidestined are international. It'd be cool if they did something like this in a new series.

digimon,35pzb9,PowerForward,1 point,Thu May 14 00:32:34 2015 UTC,The YouTube playlist has less songs than the download file in the reddit thread. Beyond that file and the unreleased music available for download at the end of the playlist I've never found a more extensive collection for dub music.

digimon,35pzb9,PowerForward,2,Thu May 14 00:50:31 2015 UTC,It is a rar file so you want WinZip or WinRar to extract all the music. (Free trial of either will do) After that it will play on Windows Media Player/VLC etc or your phone/mp3 player.

digimon,35rwlj,TheGamer821,2,Wed May 13 02:53:57 2015 UTC,"I really recommend you to watch Digimon subbed. Alone the music is totally worth it - Tamers without ""Biggest Dreamer"" is not Tamers."
digimon,35rwlj,KyuVsKing,2,Wed May 13 08:00:23 2015 UTC,Definitely. Tamers has such a awesome soundtrack. I can listen to Card Slash all day long.
digimon,35rwlj,TheGamer821,2,Wed May 13 17:03:34 2015 UTC,"To be fair though, the dub has its moments with it's own soundtrack, to the point of outdoing the original in many scene; Exp: Beelzemon using the Fist of the Beast King hits much more of an emotional cord in the dub with the music amplifying it where the original thought silence would work better in such an emotional scene."
digimon,35rwlj,KyuVsKing,2,Fri May 15 21:01:06 2015 UTC,I don't really feel it.  The Original had this as a set up before the silence which is far more effective imho https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hig3z2bioWM&index=42&list=PLquKirW0qfhBmn8vLxhif89Ct1NTQ1tvG
digimon,35rwlj,SydMontague,2,Fri May 15 23:09:08 2015 UTC,"I wasn't saying silence was bad as far as scenes go and I was just using an example. The original series and even Tamers had moments where silence was better then anything that could have been played, especially obvious in the Japanese version where the dub rarely shut up for anything. My point was that I felt the scene I used as an example benefitted from the music of the dub then the silence. But I understand if  you didn't see it as such, after all music is a matter of taste and both you and Sydmontague are just defending what you believe to be superior, I can respect that."
digimon,35rwlj,KyuVsKing,-2,Sat May 16 07:01:29 2015 UTC,"Uhm... no.  I have compared many key scenes of Tamers between japanese and US version and in every single one the US version failed to get on par with original. As for the scene you're referring to: yes, the US dub might have the more ""emotional"" (as in sad) music, however the scene is not exactly emotional in this sense, it's dramatic. Beezlemon is trying to save Juri - he is fighting after all. The music however is more like ""seperation""/death emotional - a theme that doesn't really fit when you consider that the scene is exactly about the opposite. The japanese music on the other side is a theme worthy of a fighter who has the determination to do what he thinks is what he has to do - no matter what stands in his way.   Honestly, you can't beat Takanori Arisawa this easy.  PS: Silence is music, too. One of the most emotional and effective ones."
digimon,35rwlj,SydMontague,1 point,Sat May 16 00:21:53 2015 UTC,"The key scenes thing I try believe to be one of opinion as Tamers dubbed was pretty good with its music. I said many in my post and maybe I was being a bit too generous but I really do believe the Tamers dub had many great moments in both terms of music and acting. As for the music of the scene I can see where you are coming from but the way I was coming from was not for what the music is usually used for or should be used for, i'm saying in my opinion it really enhanced the drama. At where he yells out and raises his fist to the sky trumpets build up and though it stops for Jeri's part it flairs up again loudly for the moment done, a nicely built up part that while may not belong there, did do its job. Again this was an example I was using to give for my opinion and though you disagree I was just trying to point out that the dub had its own moments musically. As a last note I was not aware silence was considered its own music genre as it is lack of, but I guess I learned something new."
digimon,35rwlj,zCynik,1 point,Sat May 16 06:51:27 2015 UTC,"I have to admit the referenced scene is not a complete failure - and that's probably true for more parts of the Tamers dub.  One core difference between the original music and the dub music I observed is, that the dub music tries to comment everything that happens on screen, while the original music is more about setting the tone/emotional basis for the whole scene without interacting with it directly. Both patterns are valid and can yield awesome results, but they usually have different use cases. The first pattern is usually something I'd expect in action scenes - something I watch for the visuals (-> action scenes, especially fast paced ones), the 2nd pattern is something I see (hear) more fitting for scenes that achieve their effect not through visuals, but more through making the viewer feel or think (-> emotional scenes). The way the US dub used it's music simply feels... wrong for me. The music seems to be forgetable and sometimes even of low quality to me (the quality issue could be either by crappy Youtube videos or the additional sound effects). And it's placement seems often bad, resulting in not creating the emotions in the viewers head the director intended (which is always bad - as a dub's job is to catch exactly what the original creators wanted, just in another language).  Silence isn't essentially the lack of music. Silence is a tool in music that can be used in many ways to a lot of effects. The most common one is the pause between 2 notes, but the one we're talking about is it's use within a narrative story. And within this, silence - especially sudden one - has the potential to literally leave your audience breathless. The original version of Wizardmon's death or Interstellar's docking scene are great examples for this. But silence can also be used for other types of scenes. As we're used to music playing all the time, a director can highlight the importance of a scene by being quite for a while. And that's sadly a part where (at least for Adventure) the US dub horribly failed. As you mentioned by yourself already: the dub rarely shuts up, preventing viewers from feeling the emptiness that many of these silent scenes try to transmit.  But I can't deny, that some people like the US soundtrack. There has to be something about it that I simply don't get - which is why I don't understand it (and I'd claim I'm usually able to understand where other people's view comes from). Maybe it's simply a cultural difference between the US and other countries. That would also explain why Hans Zimmer only has 1 Oscar..."
digimon,35rwlj,SydMontague,2,Sat May 16 17:49:56 2015 UTC,"Holes in the plot by my guess. I personally never followed Tamers as hard as I did with Digimon Adventures 1 and 2. Maybe it has something to do with the tech company that kept monitoring the digital world, can't recall to well."

digimon,35o8ii,TrueGlich,2,Tue May 12 19:32:13 2015 UTC,"Wasn't a very big fan of this analysis. On some level, I agree that courage and friendship are necessary for every relationship and digivolution here, but that same logic seems equally applicable if, say, the two who went to Mega level bore the crests of Love and Hope. If friendship is needed to digivolve, couldn't you also say Love between the digidestined and his/her partner also contributes to the digivolution process? After all, the concepts of love and friendship here are pretty similar. Same for hope. Isn't part of what fuels these kids and their heroics the hopes they have that by continuing to fight that they can save the day?  I'm not saying you're wrong. I think there's plenty of validity in what you're saying. I just don't think it's necessarily the fact that Matt and Tai bear the crests of courage and friendship and that those are inherently important. After all, if anything, it's been the crests of Hope and Light that are the actual special ones (or so we've been told by Azulongmon).  Solid video. I didn't necessarily agree with a lot of it, but I did enjoy the thought put into it. But I think as one commenter mentioned above--it's cause they're the two ""main"" characters. It's probably not any more complex than that."

digimon,35nvcg,CliffP,1 point,Tue May 12 18:46:14 2015 UTC,"There are many sequels who rehash the plots but put twist on them so they are different enough that you can't tell. Look at the two Avengers movies for proof of that and how it works well if the situation itself has changed. Hell Dragon Ball Z got away with it 2 more times after the Freiza saga. Big Bad shows up, Heroes say they should do something, the good guys get an advantage, an Ally screws something up royally, villain changes multiple times into different forms, the group tries to fight it one on one until its down to the final good guy and the final villain where the bad guy loses simply because he's evil (Freiza trying to backstab goku, Cell blowing off a deadly attack simply because its the kid firing it when Goku is dead, (K)Buu getting hit by the spirit bomb which only works on evil).

digimon,35nvcg,Xeleo,1 point,Tue May 12 16:53:07 2015 UTC,"Here is my 2 cents on who the girl could be. First she is not the antagonist but a member of rouge digidestineds who does fight for good but her methods are unjust, similar to how Plutomon isn't a member of the Olympus 12 cause his methods are cruel and unjust. This would work with the whole TRI thing and that they're three sides. Or she is one of the three villains like adventure had but in 6 movies there a slim chance."

Your co-host sucks, and it was a poor choice on your part to pick someone who vocally thinks Digimon is stupid. Having a co-host who has never seen the series is a great idea because they will surely be able to provide interesting commentary from a unique perspective. Even having someone who is overly critical of the series would be interesting, because again its a different perspective, and it will encourage us to be more critical as well, or at least see things that we had missed that might be plot holes. Having a co-host who keeps giggling to himself about how stupid this is, and how stupid that is, and how he liked this part the best because there were no digimon adds nothing to your podcast, and will probably only annoy your listeners who are all going to be long time Digimon fans.  You throw out all of the terminology at the start, this is basically a verbal ""wall of text"", why not give this information out as it becomes relavent? Secondly you didn't even bother to get the facts straight or explain things properly to your co-host when he asks a legitimate question, for example the kamiya and yagami issue, the name wasn't changed for the reason you listed, in fact the name was never  ""changed"" at all, it was a simple translation mistake, ""八神"" is read yagami and ""神八"" is read kamiya, add in the fact that Japanese is read left to right (when printed up to down, or in comics) and also right to left, add the fact that Japanese read the surname first followed by the first name, while we go by first name and then the second name, and its not surprising that someone messed up and read taichi kamiya instead of yagami taichi. Your co-host asked why ""ultimate"" isn't the final level you gave no explanation, when it would have been easy to explain that ultimate was the final level for about two years, and sometime in 1999-2000 they decided to add an even higher level that they ended up calling ""mega"". If your co-host is going to be completely ignorant of the series, I feel that you should be responsible for doing a little bit of research and actually be able to explain things properly.  You don't even get the facts straight about the episode you literally just watched. You complain at the end because tai calls koromon a floating head (English) but he never actually says that in the dub, he calls him a "" talking head"".  Lastly this podcast is longer than the two episodes that you are commenting on, and I think that is just silly. No one wants to spend more time listening to you then they spent watching the actual show."
digimon,35km5o,moezilla,3,Mon May 11 17:10:33 2015 UTC,Good criticism! Thank you moezilla. Nobody has criticised it yet so this is a good start!  I picked him because I though the conflict between me loving Digimon and him not being fond of it. I thought the name changes would be a good way to start as a bit of house keeping but I guess I was wrong on that part. For Taichi's change of name it's only what I heard so I guess I'm wrong. I should've researched it a bit more. As for the stage thing yeah I should've done more research. You're right. I'm sorry for misquoting the line. I should've wrote it down as we recorded about a week and a half after we watched it because we couldn't get a good time to record.  As for the length issue we watched two episodes twice which is about the length of the podcast episode.  We do get better by episode two because I fact check more and check the all my quotes and write them down (and we had both just watched the episode)
digimon,35km5o,moezilla,1 point,Mon May 11 21:29:24 2015 UTC,I'll do a follow up on facts in episode 3. If you listen to episode 2 let me know what you think because I think we improved a lot and can only get better. :)

The whole evolved team was completely stomped by Devimon and it was thanks to Patamon's miraculous digivolution and sacrifice that saved them.   Sames goes to Magneangemon vs Piedmon. Piedmon (a Mega level digimon) completely shat on the entire team as well as Megagarurumon and Wargreymon but didnt't stand a chance against Mangeangemon which is only an Ultimate level digimon.  T.K. is more of the team's trump card. Last minute hope.

At their best, they get to save  the day once per season (considering a digimon season is longer then most anime seasons, he got two chances).  Not forgetting to mention that they also tend to be the most idealistic of the group (he refuses to fight at first because its wrong) and act as a moral compass (which he did to the Lancer Matt).  He is a Tagalong kid through and through. The director simply didn't let that be his only defining trait."
digimon,35ir07,KazyX,2,Mon May 11 21:42:57 2015 UTC,"The writers/creators might have just been trying to purposefully misdirect everyone by make the audience think that's he is just the useless little kid (or perhaps the most relatable kid), then at the end of the Devimon arc they show that he is probably their most useful asset."

digimon,35ir07,AKluthe,16,Tue May 12 07:57:48 2015 UTC,"Were they even special?  Taichi and Yamato are the 2 characters most of the (male) audience would like to associate themselfs with. Taichi is a classical hero - a strong character who courageously fights to overcome the big bad. Yamato on the other hand is more of an antihero - as strong as Taichi, but his first thoughs are about protecting what he loves, and not winning the fight. You can say these 2 characters are pretty much different poles, which is why they react this strong to each other. The conflict between these 2 goes through the whole season, creating a lot plot points.  But their characters are not that special compared to the others, they're just the 2 most notable ones due to their strenght and roles as head of the group (I'd actually consider Sora to be part of this, too). The other characters simply have different roles (e.g. Koushiro/Izzy as the brain).  However, Taichi has one thing that makes him somehow special: Episode 21 - aka his return to the real world. The whole Episode is actually the beginning of a ""hero's journey"", a common narrative tool, containing the steps ""call to adventure"", ""refusal of the call"" and ""crossing the line"". But what makes this episode truely awesome is, that journey it is refering to is not one to come, but one that has already started. This is just great as it allowed them to make these parts even stronger than usual, as the viewer has a deeper connection to the character at this point. And everything in the episode is there to enforce this (like the different color design). The protagonist of this episode could've only been Taichi, as his character is the one that fits best in this scheme (after all, he is the hero). However his decisions is not his own - he does them in respective for the whole group.  Another pair of characters that are special compared to the others are Takeru and Patamon. They don't function like the rest in the way they fight. They either don't fight, or join late making them seemingly weak and useless. However, Takeru's crest is the one of hope and hope is what you need, when everything else seems lost. This is why their moment comes, when courague, friendship, love, knowledge, faith and purity failed (You may notice that light is missing - that is because light and hope belong together). This might let's them appear like some kind of Deus Ex Machima or overpowered, but it created some really good and emotional scenes.  I hope that sums this up a bit. I probably could continue to write for hours why Digimon is an incredibly well written show, but I don't have that time. ;)"
digimon,35ir07,SydMontague,2,Sun May 10 23:24:14 2015 UTC,"I think you're absolutely right. And to add to it, I think if you pay close attention to the show, Adventure and Adventure 02 did something really different that a season like Frontier didn't: they made everyone pretty much even.   Yes, only Taichi and Yamato got to Mega levels and eventually formed Omnimon, but that's only one level up from everyone else who only reached Ultimate. I Adventure 02 they kind of pushed it by having Paildramon digivolvr into Imperialdramon and then mode change, but again everyone was close to the same level. Alternatively in Frontier, Takuya and Koji combine their respective Beast and human Spirit evolutions to become aldamom and beowulfmon, but then take everyone else's spirits to become even more powerful thus preventing others from joining the fight and then towards the end they combine even further into one. Adventure and 02 kept everyone involved from the beginning all the way up to the end.   Another great thing that Adventure did was to give even character development to each and every character. We got character centric stories all the time even when they didn't include a new digimom evolution. On the face of it, Taichi might seem like the main character but I'd argue there is no main character. Just because he was the pseudo leader doesn't mean he was more integral to the show. Think about Yamatos parents divorce, soras issues with her mother and father, koushiro finding out he's adopted, etc."
digimon,35ir07,imperfek,1 point,Tue May 12 14:37:36 2015 UTC,how come taichi was the only one to get special training from piximon?
digimon,35ir07,SydMontague,1 point,Wed May 13 13:11:07 2015 UTC,"Taichi and Agumon got insecure after Taichi forced the SkullGreymon evolution - effectivly preventing them from evolving to champion/adult level. A problem the rest of the group didn't have. -> They didn't need Taichi's special training. (Yamato and Koushiro had special training as well, btw.)"
digimon,35ir07,catswithstaches,8,Wed May 13 13:24:42 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, they were ""special"" because they both had younger siblings that were also Digidestined. At least, that's why they were both shot with arrows from the angelic Digimon."
digimon,35ir07,pynzrz,3,Mon May 11 00:37:18 2015 UTC,"I think the question was why Taichi and Yamato were chosen by the Digiworld to be the first to have their Digimon Digivolve, the only ones able to warp Digivolve, and the only ones to DNA Digivolve (before everyone in 02 did it). I don't think them having siblings gave them those powers.   The characters were simply written to have those roles (as described by the other comments), and that coincidentally gave them an excuse to make them warp Digivolve. AFAIK the series itself doesn't explain why they can do more. Courage and friendship are the crests of the main character of 02 (Daisuke), and he was able to Digivolve further as well."
digimon,35ir07,Romiress,4,Mon May 11 16:54:49 2015 UTC,"Do you mean, IC why were they so special? Or why they were the main characters...?  IC we don't know. IRL they hit the main target demographic the most, so they were the two main characters."
digimon,35ir07,OneLameStabber,1 point,Sun May 10 19:53:40 2015 UTC,"To me no one was ""special"" people just liked them (matt and Tai) more, only reason i can see matt being special was because he went off on his own. Also I feel as if the two of them represent their crest more than others. Matt is so into friendship he is willing to be a dick. And does not liking to see people get hurt even though he can be a prick sometimes. Tai was so full of courage he would sometimes make bad decisions.  Not to mention the rest never had as much importance in their roles as matt and Tai did. I mean I based myself on matt’s examples. Had to punch many friends to get their heads right. But I did so because of who I was and there was an underlining reason. Most people just attempt to imitate the two of them. So in the end I think it is they just seem to be more important in contrast to the others. But that is just a guess by my understanding."

digimon,35iru9,Smallkittenfeet,2,Tue May 12 09:05:19 2015 UTC,It's on the official Toei YouTube channel and got released at the same time as japanese one.  -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN9xpqG1giY  About waiting... Just remember that the Digimon waited for up to a few thousand years for their partners (the 4 years between Hikarigaoka and the summer camp are 5760 years in the digital world). IMHO that makes waiting a bit more bearable. :D
digimon,35iru9,SydMontague,0,Tue May 12 09:29:48 2015 UTC,"I see.. interesting on that trailer.  I've been waiting for a sequel to 02, since I was a kid and it ended. It was extremely disappointed that tamers was not a sequel to 02, my blind hatred for that issue did not allow me to even think about watching tamers or anything beyond 02, until last year.  So yeah, waiting..... I hate waiting... even if it's a line at a food place or something.. I hate it."
digimon,35iru9,Smallkittenfeet,8,Tue May 12 09:36:11 2015 UTC,"They might split up the Mega levels in multiple movies, but I doubt they'll do one per movie. It wouldn't really fit into the pacing and patterns stories are usually told with (things, that all Digimon season's I saw followed more or less).  But maybe I'm wrong and they'll do it this way. It could work, after all.  Edit: grammar/typos..."
digimon,35iru9,SydMontague,3,Sun May 10 20:16:45 2015 UTC,The digivolutions were always one per episode...
digimon,35iru9,pynzrz,5,Mon May 11 16:57:48 2015 UTC,"The evolutions were alawys grouped per arc. Devimon arc -> all to champion, Etemon arc -> all obtain their crest, Vamdemon/Myotismon arc -> all to ultimate. Think of an arc as a movie or two and you would have all Mega evolutions in 1 or 2 movies. ;)"
digimon,35iru9,SydMontague,5,Mon May 11 17:26:53 2015 UTC,"Plus, 1 per episode and 1 per movie are completely different things, pacing and narrative-wise."
digimon,35iru9,happylittlemexican,5,Mon May 11 21:20:09 2015 UTC,But if we count the movies as all one arc and each movie as one or two episodes then the ideas of one new mega per movie makes sense. However I hope that they don't do one new Mega per movie because that has the potential to be predictable and repetitive.
digimon,35iru9,ShadeSoul,5,Mon May 11 21:23:12 2015 UTC,"Not really. Getting upgraded is usually a step before the real action starts, so usually the first half of an arc. E.g. in Devimon arc it's Episode 2-7, while arc ends at episode 13.  As you may notice, the 2 Mega levels and Takeru/Patamon don't really followed that pattern. Takeru worked, because he had a special position in the group, the Mega levels worked because they were not used in a ""leveling up"" manner, but more in a Deus Ex Machinma/Plot Twist manner.  So we might see another special case, where 1 or 2 members of the group work different to allow them something the others can't.  But as I said, I could be horribly wrong - writing and narrative can work in many different ways and I'm not exactly an expert in it. ;)"
digimon,35iru9,SydMontague,5,Mon May 11 21:48:26 2015 UTC,"A good point but couldn't that end up a little repetitive? If by the time the third one's released they've gone and had 3 more of the chosen reach mega then you can probably predict whats gonna happen in the remaining 3.   Also there's that one bit in Hurricane Touchdown with Patamon and Gatomon's mega forms but you could still be right and I'd be happy with it as long as they don't pull a ""each films climax is one of the chosen reaching mega and saving the day""."
digimon,35iru9,ParkerXD,2,Sun May 10 20:08:36 2015 UTC,"Yea well...I just realized something wrong with my point.  Since Taichi and Yamato(the 2 most important characters) already have Megas. So if the other 6 will get Megas, then the final battle thing will end up being one of the 6, rather than Taichi and Yamato, or just everyone"
digimon,35iru9,califexe,5,Sun May 10 20:11:16 2015 UTC,"... don't forget, Takeru and Hikari also had their mega forms revealed during the movies- Seraphimon and Holydramon, although I have a feeling that the latter might be retconned to Ophanimon because it's the new standard for Angewomon's evolution now, isn't it?"
digimon,35iru9,fifthalicorn,3,Sun May 10 20:06:40 2015 UTC,Isn't it Gatomon - Tail Ring = Holydramon and Gatomon + Tail Ring = Seraphimon?
digimon,35iru9,TheGamer821,3,Sun May 10 23:14:12 2015 UTC,Ofanimon not Seraphimon. Seraphimon is Patamon's Mega.

digimon,35iru9,Yoshiman400,4,Tue May 12 01:06:14 2015 UTC,"A couple of things:  1) She got the ring back at the end of 02. Angewomon -> Seraphimon might be possible, but the one more likely in that case would be Ophanimon.  2) In the Adventure Vita game, the warp evolution was to Ophanimon and not Magnadramon. Of course, she still had her ring at the time."
digimon,35iru9,fifthalicorn,2,Mon May 11 02:53:24 2015 UTC,True. I was just pointing out that Gatomon warping to Holydramon wouldn't necessarily be a retcon because I assume the little fur ball will have her tail ring in Tri
digimon,35iru9,Smallkittenfeet,-3,Mon May 11 03:11:04 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Hurricane touchdown is widely accepted as non-canon and just random filler.
digimon,35iru9,sketmachine13,1 point,Tue May 12 07:46:46 2015 UTC,"Well, technically, released media means canon,  Patamon and Gatomon already have their Ultimate (Mega) forms from the film.  And the drama CD that was released with the Blu-ray box set also revealed that Palmon warped evolved Rosemon. Can't remember exactly when that took place so could just be a 'audio ver' of one of the to-be-adventurTri-films"

digimon,35j6yb,toro44,3,Sun May 10 22:08:15 2015 UTC,"I have one of these! They're pretty cool. I think they're based off of the Digimon Savers anime as your choices are Agumon, Gaomon, Lolamon, Falcomon, and Kudamon. That's on the dark blue one. The different colors may be different. It's the standard digivice formula: pedometer to fight random digimon till you get to a boss."
digimon,35j6yb,baritoneninja,3,Sun May 10 22:34:50 2015 UTC,"Essentially it's an 'official knock off'. It's not by Bandai Japan, but instead by Bandai Asia (Which services the rest of asia, but not Japan). It's not a Japanese original one, and it's pretty weird compared to other digivices.

I mean, yeah, it's way too repetitive, and the longer version you posted is annoying with the dips to rap there, but the short show theme is perfect for digimon. Butterfly is a bit too cheerful, happy go lucky. It could be swamped with other anime themes and go fairly unnoticed. It does have it's charm during the sweet moments though, and it is more powerful emotionally. When it appears in other parts of the sub, it's perfect for those scenes. But as the title opening, it doesn't get me excited to watch the show. It's just there.  But the english version is good with it's random tech bleeps and faster pace. You were being thrusted into an adventure with danger, and you might not enjoy every moment. It's fast, digital sounding.  That said, I do like both. Just for different reasons."

I worked on it with a couple of friends and I was the one who came up with the idea of digimon evolving differently depending on whether or not the light was on as well as adding more digimon to the game!   It is a little sad that the community died. I was going to college about the time it started going out.   Id tried getting back in touch with the lead programmer a few times but he never got back to me.   If you have any quesiont id love to answer them!

It's awesome that you guys put all that  time and effort just to make a free game on the internet.  If you ever decide to reboot the game and make a new version let me know, I've no idea what I could do but I'd love to help out!"
digimon,35fh3d,Animedingo,3,Sun May 10 18:35:56 2015 UTC,"The project is unfortunately pretty dead. We'd need a new programmer and to be honest I dont have the time to invest in it    One thing that started happening to it that I didnt particularly like was that the game started turning into more of an rpg. Things like armor digi eggs were being added, the concept of a vpet was getting off track"
digimon,35fh3d,Animedingo,2,Sun May 10 18:41:48 2015 UTC,"I kind of agree, I prefer to play dmpc 2 with it's black and white graphics over dmpc pro with it's colour graphics. It's supposed to be an enhanced version of the v-pet rather than a new game so the lack of colour suits it more!"
digimon,35fh3d,DigitaruWarudo,3,Sun May 10 18:47:16 2015 UTC,"I really didn't mind the colors, It was the game mechanics that went off course that bothered me.   There was also a huge problem with hacking and cheating. People would just share save files of digimon with each other. In retrospect it bothered me more than it should have but it was still annoying"
digimon,35fh3d,Animedingo,1 point,Sun May 10 19:29:27 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean, it's like when there's that one kid in school who beats a hard level on a PS2 game and then let's everyone copy his memory card."
digimon,35fh3d,TanithArmoured,1 point,Sun May 10 19:34:49 2015 UTC,"If you guys ever want to revive the DMPC project and still need a programmer don't hesitate in contacting me, I'd love to help. What language was it written in?"
digimon,35fh3d,Kibaku,1 point,Mon May 11 07:02:34 2015 UTC,"I honestly have no idea, but a programmer is only one issue. I don't have the time to revive it, and honestly it got so out of hand that I don't necessarily want to revive it.   By all means if you want to bring it back, please do, just keep in mind it's a big project"
digimon,35fh3d,Kibaku,2,Mon May 11 07:04:55 2015 UTC,I just want to say I loved the game and still play it sometimes. I understand that life got in the way and it sucks but you have to do what you have to do right. Thanks for putting your efforts into this!
digimon,35fh3d,Crono121,6,Wed May 27 02:08:17 2015 UTC,"Calling in: Second guy on here who helped along with AnimeDingo, I was more ""Customer Services"" of the game, I dealt with the Facebook page for DMPC.  I had a Special ""Admin Digimon"" that I could use over Hamachi, VictoryGreymon, I also personally designed Destromons Sprites for the game, because he's awesome.  I personally grew quite tired of the community and I feel terrible for it but there is only so many times I could explain how the game works through Google translate at 3 in the morning.  As I said, I'm not happy about how I dealt with it but I was 18 at the time.  I have some brilliant memories of it and still chat to some of the team, mainly Dingo, the game is still going, I still help on the FB page every now and then but it's mainly ran by the main programmer who kept it going.  I loved that game, I'll also be happy to answer stuff."
digimon,35fh3d,Mattarias,3,Sun May 10 18:27:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, It's sad that the community faded out but I'm just happy you guys did it in the first place! It's still fun to play and I've got some great memories involving it."
digimon,35fh3d,TanithArmoured,3,Sun May 10 18:41:12 2015 UTC,"I had loads of fun playing it, I hooked up a mouse to my latop to double my clicking speed for the punchbag game haha.  I absolutely lost my jimmies when my Seadramon fell asleep halfway through eating once!.  Found the screenshot I took! here"

digimon,35f3cp,SydMontague,2,Sat May 9 19:19:20 2015 UTC,i wanted to know if the english version had songs. i thought i was just bad at googling
digimon,35f3cp,Riktaichi,2,Sat May 9 22:10:58 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay fair enough. The US dub didn't use the japanese soundtrack nor songs - unlike the rest of the world and all the english songs I'm aware of overuse the word ""digimon"" quite a lot. (You may know some of them from Digimon: The Movie, which ran in germany, too.)"

digimon,35ds4d,Wolfman666,1 point,Sat May 9 17:54:17 2015 UTC,which of these would you say has the most variations in terms of evolution and number of digimons?
digimon,35ds4d,Giulls,2,Sat May 9 17:56:38 2015 UTC,Dusk I believe
digimon,35ds4d,Animal31,3,Sat May 9 19:14:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, Dawn and Dusk have the most Digimon and most Digimon in the game have multiple evolutions. The game also encourages using most of a Digimon's evolutions so either game would be good for that."
digimon,35ds4d,SydMontague,3,Sat May 9 19:55:51 2015 UTC,All of them
digimon,35ds4d,uzukipyon,2,Sun May 10 01:48:31 2015 UTC,Sounds like Digimon World 1 for the PlayStation 1 for me.
digimon,35ds4d,dotyawning,2,Sat May 9 10:15:58 2015 UTC,"thanks. By the way, wasn't Veemon a main antagonist in the first Digimon Adventure anime? And then later on became a partner for one of the main characters? Or who was that villain turned partner for a human kid?"
digimon,35ds4d,uzukipyon,1 point,Sat May 9 10:30:02 2015 UTC,You're thinking about Tailmon. The white cat with green paw gloves and a tail ring. She ended up being the partner digimon of the eighth child.
digimon,35ds4d,uzukipyon,2,Sat May 9 10:33:01 2015 UTC,"yeah, but there was also another villain turned partner digimon(or at least his devolved form became a partner for the new kids.) It was a really small but poewrful villain digimon."
digimon,35ds4d,SydMontague,2,Sat May 9 10:35:36 2015 UTC,"Andiramon might be who you are thinking of. He showed up in the Zero Two movie in a corrupted form that made him become the main villain (who kidnapped Chosen Children and reverted them to little kids to find his partner). In Tamers, one of his ""species"" returns, but isn't really a villain so much as just a gatekeeper, and by helping a human, he becomes her partner instead.  Frontier and Xros Wars also has some of his lowest form appear, but you probably aren't thinking of those."
digimon,35ds4d,SydMontague,2,Sun May 10 05:51:04 2015 UTC,"Ah, I remember this guy. Must have confused him for Veemon somehow."

digimon,35ds4d,Kyrmana,1 point,Sat May 9 11:01:02 2015 UTC,"Tailmon/Gatamon turned ally in season one and became Hikari's partner. Ken+Wormmon turned ally in 02. BlackWarGreymon somehow became an ally, too. In Tamers there are Impmon (at start neutral, in middle foe and at the end ally), Lopmon (should be enemy, but never acts as one and becomes the partner of Henry's sister) and Suzakumon (at first enemy, but they stop fighting to fight a common enemy).  But in Adventure Veemon is only the partner of Daisuke/Davis, who is never the antagonist."

digimon,35dhfr,CanvasWolfDoll,9,Mon May 11 05:01:09 2015 UTC,"as someone who has only watched the first three seasons, and is chipping away at frontier:  i think adventure formula with tamers flavor  would be nice. kids pulled into another world, partner digimon, exploration, and so forth. but with a willingness not to pull every punch.  to be honest, though, all i want is tamer and partner. everything else is just frosting.  EDIT: also, a female gogglehead would be an interesting novelty."

What do i want to see after Tri? Some games being Localised due to its Popularity"
digimon,35dhfr,Iskuri,1 point,Sat May 9 12:03:02 2015 UTC,"Being on holiday in Japan right now, it doesn't even seem popular to eastern audiences. I've been trying to find a xros loader around here and can't find one for love nor money."

digimon,35dhfr,WogTheBog,3,Sat May 9 13:47:21 2015 UTC,"I just want directors to make original digidestined look powerful, they have few months constant fighting experience and therefore their digimons should be much more stronger. I wouldnt mind showing some of their high school lifes and interaction with classmates, possible who has their own digimons and have no idea how strong original digitestined's digmons are.  Beside others mega digivolutions I want to see Victorygreymon (or other past Wargreymon digivolution) or ZeedGarurumon (or same as with Wargreymon). in times where Omegamon is not available.   Maybe some digivolution similar to spirit digivolution to make digidestined actually participate in fight and not just stand (or run away) around. However I wouldnt like biomerge or fusion digivolution, as IMO from tactical point of view 2 is better than 1 when fighting enemies with numbers similar or less than ours."

digimon,35dhfr,RunnerPakhet,2,Sun May 10 11:25:53 2015 UTC,"Just another ""kids get sent to the Digital World"" story, but this time it uses different gimmicks from past series like Armor Digivolution, Digi Xros, Digi Modify as well as regular evolution, just to demonstrate how flexible Digimon evolution lines are."
digimon,35dhfr,StealthMasterMcEdgy,2,Sun May 10 13:00:58 2015 UTC,"Something new entirely or maybe something set in a Cyber Sleuth esque setting. No Sequels, Prequels or stuff like that, but really something we have not seen in the series before. Maybe with some nods to the old series, like the Xros Wars Manga did, but in general really something new with a relatively small main cast in their mid-teens. And please no chosen children."
digimon,35dhfr,RoachPowder,2,Sun May 10 15:18:03 2015 UTC,I want a digimon series that caters to a mature audience.
digimon,35ah7o,pataman1,19,Fri May 8 13:55:57 2015 UTC,"Is that picture from the first movie? Looks kind of like it, but I haven't seen it for a while."
digimon,35ah7o,MyNameisAnsem,20,Fri May 8 14:04:33 2015 UTC,"Yes it is, I forgot to write Digimon Adventure The Movie in the title instead of just Digimon Adventure. lol.  It's the event which caused the original 8 children to become Chosen Children/Digitdestined. It alsohappened around the same time as Wallace got his Digimon, and Miyako appeared in Our War Game for a split second and ended up as an actual character in 02. So it makes a strange amount of sense and seems like something the writers would do. The symbolism of the 8 kids standing on that thing vs her standing under a bridge seems to imply a connection like that too.  Or it could be nothing, lol. also i stole this from 4chan. I didn't notice it myself I'm not sure who posted it originally."
digimon,35ah7o,MyNameisAnsem,3,Fri May 8 14:08:46 2015 UTC,I had no idea who Miyako was and had to look it up. I do remember seeing her in the movie though.
digimon,35ah7o,SydMontague,12,Fri May 8 14:44:18 2015 UTC,She was Yolei in the dub.   Plus I just realized Taichi in the field with Agumon is based on the Adventure movie's credits. So they definitively have that movie in mind.
digimon,35ah7o,SydMontague,7,Fri May 8 14:46:56 2015 UTC,"Nice find!  It's not only the field scene, but also the last sentence - which happens to be ""That's why I'm here now"" in the movie as well as the trailer.  There are probably even more hidden references and hints in the trailer, we haven't yet uncovered..."
digimon,35ah7o,NighthawkXL,6,Fri May 8 15:04:59 2015 UTC,"From lurking the internet today the thing the 8 kids are standing on is from Fuji TV apparently which was the original broadcasting station.  This is obvious but  Alphamon fights Omegamon because greek letters.  Mimi's clip is like the stars she had in her hair in 02, and in other art she has shoes based on her shirt in 02. And of course she's got pink hair.   That's all I got."
digimon,35ah7o,Randomixx,7,Fri May 8 15:15:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just used Streetview to find the location of the bridge and it has to be somewhere around Fuji TV, but I couldn't really find a matching bridge, so I assume either Google Maps is outdated (or too updated - after all Tri plays in 2005), or the bridge doesn't really exist.  In the Alpha vs Omega scene the numeral '2' is used quite often in the data streams, while other data seems to be binary.  I also start to suspect that additional information is encoded within the trailer itself. The voice actors names get faded in by a audio wave form, which is unqiue per actorand the background data (in binary and ternary) in the A vs Ω could be, once decoded, reveal additional meaning. Another thing that bothers me is the scene from 1:25 to 2:10, where clearly visible blocks of different color appear. However, these could be create unintentional due to the video's encoding/compression..."
digimon,35ah7o,SydMontague,2,Fri May 8 15:59:34 2015 UTC,"Well, you know what this means...  It's time for a community rewatch of the movie to find more tidbits of information hidden within them."
digimon,35ah7o,TheDWGM,1 point,Fri May 8 16:01:32 2015 UTC,"The trailer even ended with that freaking whistle.  Not exactly ""subtle"", though."
digimon,35ah7o,krfz41,2,Sat May 9 03:57:37 2015 UTC,"The first teaser ended with that whistle, too. And that one exclusively referenced the last episode of season one - in which Tailmon/Gatomon happens to use the whistle as well. So I always associated the whistle with that episode and not with the movie."
digimon,35ah7o,kuury,6,Sat May 9 08:10:51 2015 UTC,In the teaser when Greymon fights Kuwagamon it appears also very similar to the Parrotmon scene in the first movie as well.
digimon,35ah7o,Presenex,14,Fri May 8 21:25:12 2015 UTC,"Wow, there are so many references to the first movie in the trailer:   Greymon fight scene The random girl ""That's why I'm here."" Credits scene of the first movie, Taichi and Agumon switched places in the trailer."
digimon,35ah7o,TheGamer821,17,Fri May 8 16:02:38 2015 UTC,I really hope this ends up being a tragic series about growing up and how people can change.

There should be something like an S or a B before the cards number.  If you have the starter set and you are missing cards, its nearly worthless, you can buy a complete set for relatively cheap. Check eBay for prices but I'm guessing you could sell the whole thing for $5 or less.  If its the booster than the prices vary a bit more, but the earliest booster set sells for the lowest prices out of all the boosters (and 1-50 means its the earliest set). You'll have to look up prices on eBay."

digimon,3595cf,jontamjk,24,Fri May 8 03:34:32 2015 UTC,"The 02 characters will probably not play a big part since the focus is on the original digi-destined, but I did expect them to show up in a supporting role somehow. Not a fan of 02 personally, but I do think it'd have been a bit lame to just pretend it never happened."
digimon,3595cf,Masterofknees,16,Fri May 8 06:28:05 2015 UTC,"I get the grief about S2, all the unfinished storylines and shit, but besides that I thought it was fine, I'd be actually disappointed if they pretended none of it happened."
digimon,3595cf,Zen-Zinxe,16,Fri May 8 05:57:10 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'm glad because while I didn't necessarily enjoy 02, I did like the characters. Can't have Imperialdramon without Davis.  But for those that were hoping for a series without Davis, here's another straw to grasp: It could be an alternate reality, non-DigiDestined Davis that they instead build on and turn into a secondary character. After all, he does go to school with Kari and TK."
digimon,3595cf,IAMA_MAGIC_8BALL_AMA,14,Fri May 8 04:30:37 2015 UTC,"I liked 02, it was ok. What I didnt like was the epilogue. Dont care if you keep 02, retcon the epilogue."
digimon,3595cf,theVWally,3,Fri May 8 04:55:54 2015 UTC,"In the subtitled version of the trailer, the first line is something about the world on a path not taken...or something. It came across as though they were saying that the story ended one way (02's canon ending), but this is another direction. I would assume a world in which not everyone got a Digimon partner, and also they don't pursue the endgame lives from the original ending."
digimon,3595cf,josephdean21,8,Fri May 8 14:15:29 2015 UTC,"This, so much this.  It'd be a slap in the face to just act like none of those characters existed, but a universe where TK and Kari don't end up together isn't one I want to be a part of  Plus, it's sort of like payback in a way for making Tai and Matt sit out as supporting characters during 02"
digimon,3595cf,sammylaco,3,Fri May 8 06:38:15 2015 UTC,I just want a Tai and Sora couple is that too much to ask!
digimon,3595cf,theVWally,5,Fri May 8 16:09:36 2015 UTC,"That's good, as they shouldn't leave out the cast of 02, even if they just cameo."
digimon,3595cf,Muur1234,7,Fri May 8 22:02:44 2015 UTC,I'm glad. Hopefully we will see the rest of the 02 DigiDestined even just for one part of the series. Maybe in a part that has to do with the Dark Ocean.
digimon,3595cf,MageOfHope,2,Fri May 8 05:34:45 2015 UTC,"I didn't know there were so many fans of Daisuke/Davis. What about him is appealing? He doesn't really grow as a character in 02. Heck, the end of the show sort of revels in his lack of depth when he becomes immune to BelialVamdemon/MaloMyotismon's illusion because of how he's all hakuna matata. Plus there's of course the noodle cart thing."
digimon,3595cf,crewnh,4,Fri May 8 17:55:03 2015 UTC,"That's actually the reason I'm excited to hear that he might make an appearance; there's so much wasted potential in the character.   Davis never changed from his goofy, naive, and altruistic self throughout all of 02 despite the other characters developing. I want to see Davis' character developed, or at least fleshed out in some way."
digimon,3595cf,Sad_banker,0,Sat May 9 01:08:06 2015 UTC,"Why do you think he didn't change? He is the first to give Ken a chance, he goes against Taichi to help Ken in Tamachi, he provides the tipping strength to help battle the darkness and send Daemon to the Dark Ocean, and in the end even Takeru and Hikaru give up in the face of Vamdemon, but he fights alone against the mental illusion. I would hate for him to be cut out because he's a character that is determined and still fun."

digimon,3595cf,user2338,0,Sat May 9 16:25:29 2015 UTC,"Huge fan of Daisuke and I think if you watch the original sub, you will have a different opinion of him. He's not immune because he's vapid, he's immune because he is focused on defeating him. The original script builds him up over time to that moment but the dub totally ruined the character."
digimon,3595cf,figandmelon,2,Fri May 29 17:03:46 2015 UTC,OMG  This works for my plot theory.  Daisuke's V-mon could be the Magnamon of that universe's Royal Knights : D  That just him is currently marked works in favor of him having an important role (or mentioning anyways)
digimon,3595cf,KazyX,4,Sun May 10 22:23:10 2015 UTC,Search Engine Optimization. It makes sense to use a well known name - that many people might google - in the meta tags to lead more people to the site. It's really no indicator nor proof for 02's status within Tri.
digimon,3595cf,SydMontague,2,Fri May 8 09:03:28 2015 UTC,Lets all act like we didn't expect this
digimon,3595cf,DoubleOhFour,2,Fri May 8 04:05:11 2015 UTC,"Just scrap Matt + Sora (Yamatora if there is never an eng dub) and I'm okay with 02 being canon. Digimon spent a good amount of time hinting towards Tai and Sora's eventual relationship and the movie practically confirmed it, but then 02 rolled around and even childhood me couldn't stand that scene where Tai finally got the guts to ask Sora to a semi-date and she basically says ""Sorry but...Matt is just a lot cooler than you...I mean he's like WAY cooler than you. Sure he's doesn't talk much...especially to me, in fact I think we had less dialogue exchange than any other characters, and he never really showed any interest in me, and he's kind of an asshole from time to time, but he's in a band! Have you SEEN how cool he is?""   What was almost as bad was Tai's response: ""Oh...yeah. I get it. Matt is pretty cool, after all. It's easy to see why you like him."""
digimon,3595cf,John__Wick,4,Fri May 8 10:13:58 2015 UTC,"I'd like to point out that the dialogue you're refering to, does not exist in the original. Taichi is doing nothing else than encouraging her - without grief or disappointment in his voice. (Although Sora is openly aware, that this isn't easy for Taichi)  As for Yamato and Sora not talking too much to each other, I'd say that makes perfectly sense based on Yamato's personality. He isn't exactly an extrovert person (like Taichi is), he is actually pretty shy - especially when it comes to his feelings. But communication is more than just mere words said to each other. ;)  But they could've executed this conflict way better, that's for sure."
digimon,3595cf,SydMontague,1 point,Fri May 8 11:04:09 2015 UTC,"Rather than restate my opinion or offer a proper rebuttal to your well worded response, Imma just let emotion dictate my actions from here on:   SorTai for life! TKari 4evur! Matt x harmonica! Mimi x hat! Leomon x mortuary!"
digimon,3595cf,John__Wick,4,Fri May 8 11:32:02 2015 UTC,"See, I like that Tai and Sora don't end up together. Did you end up with your ten year old crush? Probably not. Life happens, people change."
digimon,3595cf,cyvaris,3,Fri May 8 11:20:48 2015 UTC,"Difference is my ten year old crush never showed signs of liking me and she ended up with a guy she showed an interest in. Not saying shit like this doesn't happen in real life, but it didn't make since given the character's personalities. Sora seemed like she just last minute caved under ""fan girlism"" when she saw a crowd of girls swarming Matt after a concert. She never struck me as that kind of girl in the series, Mimi maybe. In fact, Mimi shutting down Joe for Matt seems like it would have been pretty much in line with all character personalities. That I'd believe."
digimon,3595cf,John__Wick,4,Fri May 8 11:25:44 2015 UTC,"Thing is most of the 01 group is shunted to the background, so we don't really get to see their prospective. I can see ""romance"" drama happening that we just don't get to see. Of course sub vs dub was also at fault here. Also, look back at 01, Matt/Sora seem to actually have some pretty poignant moments, where as Tai/Sora...just interact."
digimon,3595cf,cyvaris,1 point,Fri May 8 11:37:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, we all know that there is going to be romance. The new series won't be able to resist. I just want it to be believable. And...well...dammit if I just want Tai to catch a break. Dub version was funny, brave (duh), and a damn good brother for Kari. I kind of aspired to be like him when I was younger. He was my favorite character and I just need him to have a fairy tale ending."
digimon,3595cf,John__Wick,7,Fri May 8 11:46:59 2015 UTC,"I know that last feeling. Animorphs was my series as a kid and good god, that ending just rips your heart out if you wanted certain characters to end up together."

digimon,358954,DivineArbalest,9,Thu May 7 22:48:26 2015 UTC,"I don't see any reason for 02 to be retconned other than people's wishful thinking.  If I remember right, way back around the announcement of tri, someone said that some of the things that happen in 02's epilogue are going to be built toward (which likely means that it's about bridging the gap between the Real World and Digital World, not necessarily marriages and jobs).  I personally don't want it to be retconned, but I'm one of the few that actually like 02.  The story is meant to be a 15th anniversary of the first season, so they are going to focus on the original eight, of course, since that was what the first series focused on.  But I can see the other four having at least cameo roles, kind of what the older DigiDestined had in 02."
digimon,358954,SydMontague,5,Thu May 7 22:55:19 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I was hoping for as well. I loved the second season.
digimon,358954,Romiress,7,Thu May 7 22:59:08 2015 UTC,"The problem with 02 is, that it's partially so fucked up, that you can't repair anymore without declaring at least some things non-canon - at least if you want to avoid logic errors and plot holes. The most noteable of these things might be the explaination how the Digital World works, which is 100% contradictory to the explaination of the first season. This is why I'd prefer certain parts of 02 to be declared non-canon for the sake of the writers and the story itself.  But that's just my opinion and does not decide how it will be, so let's get more objective. First thing to notice would be Taichi's goggles which are actually in possession of Taichi and not Daisuke - as they should be considering 02. That's not proof, as Taichi could've bought a new pair or Daisuke gave them back temporarily. However, the goggles have a symbolic character, so I don't consider the first explaination as very likely.  I'm not aware of any 02 related hints in the games on the site, but while I've played over 10000 puzzles I have never tried myself in the typing game - so I can't speak for that. However, there is a 02 logo at the festival announcement. That at least shows that they are aware that 02 exists, but as it's on a secundary and not really Tri related page, I wouldn't rate it too high.  So basically: we still don't know. ;)  Now, to speculate a bit. ""This world has chosen"" surely sounds like an metaphor, but what if they actually mean it literally? How can a world chose it's reality? Well, a world is defined by observation. The same information can, when observed differently, yield different results. In a digital context it's extremly easy to do so. Just shift your reading pointer by a bit or use a different way of displaying your data - for example ternary instead of binary. And actually, not only does the trailer shows the - for computers uncommon - numeral ""2"" quite often in the fighting scene between Alphamon and Omegamon, the title ""Tri."" would make much more sense in the ternary theory. The ternary theory works regardless of 02's status - some aspects might work better or worse depending on it."
digimon,358954,SydMontague,3,Fri May 8 00:58:12 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Taichi having goggles has more to do of it being symbolic that he's the main character for this series again.
digimon,358954,moezilla,4,Fri May 8 02:09:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not aware of anything that's contradictory between Adventure and 02, especially in terms of how the Digital World works. If you don't mind, can you fill me in?  Yeah Taichi's goggles was interesting to me.. He doesn't seem to ever wear them on his head though. And it was never shown in any of the previous promotional material, so maybe it's simply symbolic for nostalgia's sake to show it in the trailer.  I personally really enjoyed 02. It wasn't as tightly written or consistent as Adventure, but man oh man it had potential. I don't think anything in Adventure hit me as hard as Ken's amnesia episode. I'm 25 years old right now and that episode still gets me wrecked everytime I see it. 02 was a LOT more emotional than the previous season.. philosophical even. They discussed their views on killing Digimon, BlackWarGreymon had an entire episode and arc discussing his nature and why he's drawn to combat. The episodes did feel a bit formulaic, and I guess it was an issue of handling so many characters. While there were only 3 new main characters, they heavily connected them to the previous 8 (2 of whom joined the new team). At first it seemed like they were trying to make one new character a mixture of 2 previous characters (ie. Daisuke was half Taichi and half Yamato etc.) but by the middle of the season they were definitely their own characters."
digimon,358954,SydMontague,1 point,Fri May 8 01:30:20 2015 UTC,"Adventure explains the digital world by a world that is made up from computer data and exists within the human world's computer network. That means the digital world is a child world to the real world, as it is made up from physical matter. (Like any virtual world) 02 however tries to explain it with a multiverse theory where human world, digital world and all the other worlds are on the same level to each other as well as that Digimon are nothing more than from ghost possessed data.  02's explaination is contradictory to Adventure as the digital world can't be made up from computer data and therefore not digital, as that's forbidden in the concept of parallel worlds.  That beging said, the 02 explaination makes from a scientific standpoint little to no sense, while the Adventure explaination mostly does (the only fantasy is how the digital and the human world interact with each other), so my favorite is clear.  About 02 itself... Yes, it had potential, but they didn't use it well in most cases. The overall scenario, writing and pacing wasn't as good as in the first season. Due to the return to the human world at the end of every episode it felt like all episodes were standalone, as the main plot and the episode plot were on 2 different levels. Therefore there are some episodes I'd consider as filler as they don't advance the main story at all. And of course there are some things that are really good - Ken and BlackWarGreymon are perfect examples - but the overall season contains too many plot holes and is not able to keep up with the overall quality of the first season."

digimon,358954,alexnichele,3,Fri May 8 06:45:45 2015 UTC,First part is titled Reunion  Nothing to reunite if 02 is canon

There was an official statement somewhere that said 02 is canon. I don't know where that statement is though.

digimon,3524xh,typopup,4,Thu May 7 01:17:38 2015 UTC,"Depends on the tone of the movie. Some early digimon movies have a whole lot of nothing happening, with some character build up."

digimon,3524xh,ServeGondor,55,Wed May 6 16:56:47 2015 UTC,"I'm liking the new animation style. Everything seems to point towards them doing this justice, I mean, it is coming out over a year after it was announced, so they must have some big things planned. Like Omnimon vs Alphamon O_O  EDIT: according to /a/ this isn't going to be a show, but rather a 6-part OVA series, with its first theatrical release in November. Take this with a grain of salt as we don't know yet.   There's a discussion of /r/anime about it:  http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/35251x/digimon_adventure_tri_theatrical_movie_to_be/  EDIT 2: Guys, lets not lose track of what's important here. Yes it sucks it will take a long while for us to see it, but the production quality is amazing and its clear that this is being lovingly made.   It's more Digimon, what's not to love?!"
digimon,3524xh,pynzrz,7,Wed May 6 13:57:03 2015 UTC,"It's not just ""according to someone"" since it was stated in the trailer :) Sad that it's so far away and not a complete series, but hopefully it'll be packed with great story and beautiful art!"
digimon,3524xh,moezilla,-10,Wed May 6 20:04:46 2015 UTC,"I feel like the art and animation are both terrible looking, plus the animation in the actual episodes will almost certainly be worse (trailers always get a big budget).  So to me there's plenty not to love."
digimon,3524xh,butterfly1763,12,Wed May 6 17:15:00 2015 UTC,"(trailers always get a big budget).   With anime, trailers are usually just parts of the episodes or the opening animation. This is most likely not the opening, so I think this is what we can expect from the actual movies."
digimon,3524xh,SwashyRising,-5,Wed May 6 17:27:43 2015 UTC,Stop damage controlling. This is complete BS and everyone knows it. Gee can't wait to view this in exactly a years time considering how long it takes for a dvd release.
digimon,3524xh,ServeGondor,6,Thu May 7 15:02:07 2015 UTC,"Damage controlling? I have no interest in damage controlling, I'm not being paid by Toei I'm simply expressing my opinion.   Does it suck we have another long wait ahead of us? Yes, but so what? They owe us nothing. The franchise was more or less dead after Xros Wars, and the video games were met with tepid responses at best. I'm just glad that we're getting a new Digimon Adventure series after so long.   This didn't have to happen you know, they had it wrapped up but they've bought it back for us (and our money). I refuse to complain that a new high quality Digimon show is coming out.   EDIT: and how is it BS exactly that they want to tell a tight compact story with 6 OVAs rather than stretching it out into a bloated series? Yes they may want fans money by releasing it in cinemas but that's business. Digimon is not a big franchise, if the fans want a high quality series they need to pay for it. Not that it matters for us outside of Japan, as we'll almost certainly just pirate it. And considering that the majority of us were just going to watch it subbed online, we really don't have anything to complain about."
digimon,3524xh,SwashyRising,-8,Thu May 7 15:22:57 2015 UTC,They owe us nothing? Lolwhat? Do you realise what supply and demand is? Obviously not. You are damage controlling to an absolute T kid. I'd take a seventh series over this BS any day.
digimon,3524xh,ServeGondor,6,Thu May 7 15:29:46 2015 UTC,"Yes they owe us nothing. Businesses and artists don't owe content to their fans. They are not compelled to do things just because some fans may want it.  They didn't HAVE to create Adventure 3 but they see money in it and they're choosing to make it. And you didn't respond to any of my other points, about piracy, for example, proving how strong of an argument you have. But regardless, you continue to whine. Don't watch the movies they wouldn't be getting you're money anyway. The majority of us will watch and (hopefully) enjoy.   EDIT: and what the hell does supply and demand have to do with owing fans anything? You're trying to sound smart to cover up your butthurt and failing. Apple doesn't make new iPhones every year because they are compelled to by their fans, or because they owe consumers anything. They do it because there is a demand for it. But that has nothing, absolutely nothing to be with them owing consumers anything because they don't. And it goes the same way. We owe businesses and artists nothing, we have purely a transactional relationship, that's it."
digimon,3524xh,SwashyRising,-6,Thu May 7 15:37:06 2015 UTC,I'm not trying to argue anything with you here. You aren't the one I'm angry at. You're the only one trying to start a petty argument because you say I'm 'whining'. How the fuck would you know if I don't pay to watch anime? I pay subscriptions to Crunchyroll not that it's any of your business.   You comparing this matter to Apple makes you look quite the fool.   I will watch it when it comes out and enjoy it. Probably a bigger Digimon fan than you are hence why I am so pissed off.   So take that Toei ass kissing attitude elsewhere please. Thank you.
digimon,3524xh,ServeGondor,4,Thu May 7 15:51:23 2015 UTC,"Congratulations for paying for Crunchyroll. Now how exactly would that be getting money to Toei then? You're making the assumption that if it was a series they would put it on Crunchyroll but that's far from a given.  And yes I'm the one starting an argument, says the person who tried to initially call me out for ""damage controlling"". So childish. Yes you must definitely be a bigger Digimon fan than I am because I refuse to be butthurt over getting a new show.   You're backpedalling on everything you said. You implied they owed us something but then when I destroyed your argument with an apt analogy you resort to name calling as you know you have no leg to stand on.   And yep I'm a Toei ass kisser. I definitely kiss the ass of a company I have no attachment to, keep telling yourself that buddy, keep telling yourself its impossible for people to have opinions separate from your own."
digimon,3524xh,SwashyRising,-4,Thu May 7 15:58:33 2015 UTC,"Tell me, how am I back-pedalling? (The correct spelling).  I was talking in general not about paying toei. There would be no way of me paying them but if it meant them making the series available and not theatre exclusive I sure as hell would pay. Is that even the point though?   I don't see how you can defend the fact that it is theatre exclusive to Japan. But hey looks like i'm talking to some ass kisser who think he destroyed my argument even though there was none. LOLOLOL get over yourself kid. I just said you were damage controlling this BS but hey like you said people can't have a different opinion on the situation from your own.  Grow up."
digimon,3524xh,ServeGondor,2,Thu May 7 16:07:26 2015 UTC,"""Kid"", ""grow up"". Right from the onset you've used those terms in a derogatory manner to try and take away from my arguments. You started this by calling me out on damage controlling when in fact I was expressing my opinion. And now I'm not letting this go.   Your initial comment that started this called Toei's decision BS. Then you went on to imply that they owed us something, somehow. Now I too don't agree that they should be releasing it in theatres, I think they're losing valuable money in Japan by not giving the consumers here a chance to pay for the product. But I don't believe at all they owe us anything. They don't. And we don't owe them anything.   At the end of the day we're getting new Digimon, against all odds its coming back, and instead of being happy many fans such as yourself is pointing that the release of the product isn't perfect. No it's not perfect. But at least we're getting a new series.  You call me a kid and tell me to grow up yet call me a Toei ""ass kisser"". I watch very little anime. Digimon has my interest because it stems back to my childhood. I have no relation or attachment to Toei in any way shape or form. I barely know any of their other products. You need to get it through your brain that just because people don't instantly condemn anything a business does it doesn't mean they are a corporate ass kisser. You're use of derogatories throughout this exchange has shown out of the two of us, the one who needs to ""grow up"", may in fact be you.   Keep arguing. I have nothing better to do and you're keeping me quite entertained if I'm honest :-)  EDIT: and you blatantly misread my comment. I said it is ok for people to have differing opinions on this and all matters. I wouldn't be arguing with you now if you hadn't called me out for damage controlling when I was just expressing my own opinion. I have been having constructive discussions about this with other people, yet you had to go and talk down to me. That is not the way to have a constructive conversation and will almost certainly bring about blowback."
digimon,3524xh,SwashyRising,-5,Thu May 7 16:26:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not really seeing what you are trying to argue. That they don't owe us anything? Is that it? That seems to be all you have and you actually agree with me that it is BS how they make it a theatre exclusive release. I know we are getting a new series and it's great, don't you see that's why I'm pissed off? It was some bullshit that I didn't care about or if it looked terrible I wouldn't give it a second glance. It's the fact I was so hyped that makes this so damn painful.  And yeah you were damage controlling and you know it. That's why you are so touchy about it when i called you out. I shall continue to talk down to you like the little child you are."

digimon,3524xh,MarvelSeer,5,Wed May 6 15:54:21 2015 UTC,alphamon   personally.. no. she might be the cause as to why alphamon is fighting them
digimon,3524xh,tacomalvado,10,Wed May 6 16:39:20 2015 UTC,I just don't know... I had so many ideas before the trailer and now most are gone.  One Question: Are Omegamon and Alphamon fighting on the Internet?
digimon,3524xh,compoundgc161,9,Wed May 6 14:35:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, they're fighting /b/."

digimon,3524xh,SSJ5Gogetenks,-6,Wed May 6 14:39:29 2015 UTC,its only 6 episodes and the aesthetics are horrible

digimon,3524xh,Thedovahkiin090105,1 point,Wed May 6 14:44:28 2015 UTC,ugh I dunno. In Japan Anime Movies aren't always 60-90 Minutes. Just look at the Digimon Movies. The Digimon Savers Movie is so short it could've been a regular episode.
digimon,3524xh,Animal31,10,Fri May 8 20:34:21 2015 UTC,Do you not remember Pokemon Origins? That was like like 3 episodes and was a billion times better than the anime ever was.
digimon,3524xh,FinntheHue,6,Wed May 6 16:48:29 2015 UTC,"Sure, but I wasnt exactly excited about that either, and it was basically just advertisement for pokemon X  And yeah, I would rather watch 400 or whatever episodes of pokemon Origins, and that would definitely be worth getting excited about"

digimon,3524xh,alberto549865,14,Thu May 7 13:02:42 2015 UTC,"I can easily see the expressions being good on each character to give them personality when moving. I'm just pissed we have to wait longer. Even more pissed if this isn't a series. I was also pissed when they showed the original cast we thought were appearing wouldn't be to my understanding.  Buuut enough pisssing. HYPE LOCOMON ACTIVATE!!!!!  0: GOGGLES!!!!  1:GOGGLES!!!!!!!!!!!! 2: GOGGGGGGLLLLLLLLLEEEEESSSSS!!!!!! 3: OMEGAMON!!!!! 4: OH MY GOD THE TEARS!!! I CANT STOP!!! 5: HOLY SHIT IS THAT ALPHAMON!!!! 6: DIGIVICE!!!! 7: TTHOSE FIGHT SEQUENCES LOOK AWSOME!!! 8: EIGHT CHILDREN!!!! Ha ha ha!! I am a vampire. Who can count. Ok, fire away.  So from my analysis of the beginning speech I am going to predict this may be an alternate time line where 02 never happened. Or 02 was a timeline that was not supposed to happen. Before 02 lovers flame me to hell its merely speculation based on the sun trailer of ""the future that wasn't supposed to be"" or something. 02 cannon or not I'm just happy Tai has his goggles back.  Facts I've picked up and things to keep in mind:  1: November is a long wait. 2: it's an ova. 6 parts by the looks of it. Ocd members prepare yourselves. There should be eight lol. 3: the original cast won't be reprising their roles it seems unless it's just the digimon. 4: this one is the silver lining: please remember digifans, the original series was supposed to be only a theatrical ova movie. This ova was the first glimpse Japan would get of digimon ever. Greymon vs parotmon. Popularity skyrocketed into the first season we know and love today. That one ova gave us over 50 episodes of magic. Now, imagine what this hype train of movies, toys and video games will do. Yeah, I'm not too confident either but there's always hope. Just blow those whistles till they inevitably here our plea for a full series."
digimon,3524xh,oneofmanythrowawayyo,5,Wed May 6 14:40:38 2015 UTC,You also can't forget about the revenue they'll make outside Japan.
digimon,3524xh,ThatAwesomePenguin,5,Wed May 6 16:50:33 2015 UTC,I think it makes a lot of sense to have new voices for the humans since from 11 - 17 is when puberty strikes hard. They kept the Digimon voices because Digimon don't really age LOL

digimon,3524xh,eddieswiss,6,Wed May 6 14:15:38 2015 UTC,Hmmm. I wonder if there's a possibility that they might splice the OVAs up into episodes for the dub.

digimon,3524xh,Pseudosaur,3,Wed May 6 14:14:56 2015 UTC,"Now that we're actually getting a snippet of what's to come... I'm SUPER excited. I expected Tri to just be some OVA thing from the beginning, but what animation we've gotten from this trailer is enough to make me really want to see this and where they're going with it, regardless of how it's presented.  So there was some significance behind mentioning that all the partners have their original voices after all, seeing as how the kids no longer do. Also, I'm definitely not feeling these official subs for it, and if the official subs on Netflix are any indication then I'm definitely going to hope we get some fansubbers on this project."
digimon,3524xh,BloodBotis,3,Wed May 6 17:03:58 2015 UTC,Guys guys guys guys guys guys guys. Something is happening!!! I'm so excited. Looks like the fight choreography is gonna be great. I hope this is great. I logged in to comment just to somehow vent my excitement. Man this is awesome.
digimon,3524xh,Waffleshot,4,Wed May 6 17:26:33 2015 UTC,I was unsure about the art style when it was first revealed but it looks soooo goood in motion!
digimon,3524xh,Muur1234,5,Wed May 6 18:12:24 2015 UTC,"They all kinda look ""same face""-y to me, but that could also be from the headshots being uniform."
digimon,3524xh,KyuVsKing,4,Wed May 6 18:36:07 2015 UTC,"Cool trailer.  Two hours each, maybe?  I'd rather a series however, especially if it ends up with it taking like 3 years for us to see them all.  ...and having watched the dub as a kid, 10 years!?"
digimon,3524xh,Muur1234,4,Wed May 6 21:47:19 2015 UTC,"Actually we have a higher chance of seeing it dubbed sooner as a film series then as a TV series. Yes we have to wait anyways and we would have to wait for longer overall then for a TV series, but a film will have a bigger priority and usually has more effort then the average TV series. With the original Japanese cast showing up and the majority of English VA's being constant presence in the series from Izzy as Lucemon to Sora as Akari/Angi there's a great chance the originals will be coming back when its dubbed as well, even Joshua Seth whose retired from Voice Acting admitting he would be happy to come back if only asked by Sabin. Overall the films are a great thing for us in terms of dubbing and while i'm sad it'll take so long, i'm more then happy with the change."

digimon,3524xh,NowaSowa,2,Thu May 7 03:49:04 2015 UTC,The animation quality is top notch but Taichi having his goggles again kinda bothers me.
digimon,3524xh,catswithstaches,15,Wed May 6 14:01:10 2015 UTC,"It feels right, though. They can always explain it by saying that Taichi bought another pair. :P"
digimon,3524xh,TheGamer821,12,Wed May 6 15:40:18 2015 UTC,THIS. Everyone makes it seem like there is one one pair of these in existence.
digimon,3524xh,ThatAwesomePenguin,4,Wed May 6 16:02:10 2015 UTC,I just think that his original goggles are really iconic to the series. Him just buying another pair seems a bit off.
digimon,3524xh,TheGamer821,1 point,Wed May 6 16:21:46 2015 UTC,"I dunno about that. In Digimon, especially adventure, Goggles are a symbol of you being a leader. Taichi gave Daisuke his Goggles in the first episode of 02 just because of that. I would be a dick move to say ""yeah take these Leader Goggles I'm wanted to get new ones anyway""."

digimon,3524xh,SwashyRising,3,Thu May 7 08:35:37 2015 UTC,"I personally hope it references the 02 epilogue. While writing 02 epilogue the writers chose a future and ""future which shouldn’t have been chosen"" kinda fits in into that.  I dunno I'm invested into it. That's great."
digimon,3524xh,BTrumbl,2,Thu May 7 08:38:37 2015 UTC,So it's now 6 movies in theaters....Lord knows when we'll see it...  I honestly think all the hype and hope I had for this is now gone....  I feel sad now
digimon,3524xh,SydMontague,2,Wed May 6 16:15:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly I can't understand how people can be ok with this? This is underhanded to say the least.   For one, it was supposed to be a SPRING release. But no now it's a sixth month delay, half a year.   I could deal with this part, hey it's just waiting right? But nope it gets worse, it isn't a series like we all thought, nope, it's a theatrical release. The hell? I'm 100000 percent sure THIS was not the plan to begin with it was supposed to be the seventh series in Digimon or else they would not have waited a year to come out with this crushing news.  Couldn't get much worse right? WRONG. It's a theatrical exclusive release. This is a slap to the face to any and all of us on here and elsewhere getting so excited over it being released. It's toei basically saying that we can't have it, we don't have a right to it and the japanese audience is the only audience deserving of it. Well they sure as hell didn't make the nade nade exclusive to Japan, nope that was international.   Honestly I felt like crying watching the trailer because it looks so good. It kills me knowing that the original reason I got into digimon is being taken away from me, knowing that we as an international fan base of Digimon mean nothing to them depresses me so much.  I should have guessed this with the good digimon games being exclusive to Japan but I gave the benefit of the doubt there. Translating RPG a heavily texted RPG is hard. But absolutely NOTHING about this is inexcusable."
digimon,3524xh,BTrumbl,1 point,Thu May 7 15:16:16 2015 UTC,Can anyone identify the Digimon that Greymon is fighting? I'm fairly new to the franchise and I've only watched 01 and 02.   Pictures for reference.

digimon,3524xh,Harpoon_Torpedo,1 point,Thu May 7 08:59:04 2015 UTC,"Disappointed and concerned as a whole.  The reduction to a 6 part film series does not bode well for localization and I feel like the new season of DBZ that was announced as well as the lukewarm reception for crystal probably has Toei trying to redistribute their resources and priorities for this series...  It would take a lot of news concerning how this will be distributed and brought to the west, as well as some clarity behind why it was decided to be a 6 part movie series, as well as clarification on how long each movie will be to make me not be worried about this production anymore."

After letting it settled in, I don't think it'll be that bad! I'd rather have 6-90minute movies with amazing animation of my childhood than 50 episodes of possibly degrading quality.   I just really hope the movies are actually decently length though! if they can make them 90-120 minutes each it'll be anywhere between 520-720 minutes of digimon altogether which is basically a 2-cour series in combination ^_^! im excited"
digimon,3524xh,Roku-ro,-7,Wed May 6 16:34:57 2015 UTC,"Im not going to lie  it looks horrible. The digimon look fine, but the human characters looks so bland and generic its really offputting"
digimon,3524xh,wynaut_23,10,Wed May 6 14:00:51 2015 UTC,"Easy to say that now, and nobody can honestly disagree with you(because all the faces look the same), but wait until we see them in character and talking and each having their own personalities."
digimon,3524xh,Chriiiiiiiiisss,5,Wed May 6 14:02:55 2015 UTC,"Well, I do disagree because I love their design."
digimon,3524xh,godblow,2,Wed May 6 15:35:56 2015 UTC,"Is there going to be dubbed released? Because I find it impossible to watch anime subbed. I don't want to read, i want to watch, it takes me out of the show and I can't really pick up personalities in another language that I don't know."
digimon,35456c,kinght6,22,Wed May 6 23:13:25 2015 UTC,Why is this getting me more pumped then the Japanese trailer.
digimon,35456c,TrandoshanGuy,7,Thu May 7 01:49:50 2015 UTC,I was just about to type this verbatim.
digimon,35456c,NowaSowa,11,Thu May 7 02:04:36 2015 UTC,"You know, even with the rap... I still find myself loving it. Just having these characters back after so long is enough."
digimon,35456c,NighthawkXL,10,Wed May 6 23:56:52 2015 UTC,why is this so fucking cool? holy crap.
digimon,35456c,VacantVagabond,10,Thu May 7 00:37:49 2015 UTC,I've watched this three times and get goosebumps on how great this is.
digimon,35456c,akumaprincess,10,Thu May 7 03:51:01 2015 UTC,"People can say what they want about the dub, but the movie soundtrack is still on point. And the Digi-Rap, while lame, is still something I can completely recite and my best friends and I get COMPLETELY hype from it.  SO yeah, this trailer has got me PUUUUUUMPED!!!! <3"
digimon,35456c,emichux3,4,Thu May 7 07:52:30 2015 UTC,The Digimon movie's soundtrack is my favorite movie soundtrack of any movie EVER and always has been. this trailer was so amazing.
digimon,35456c,pinkoctillery,5,Thu May 7 14:40:21 2015 UTC,That was actually really well done
digimon,35456c,Whatisjuicelol,7,Thu May 7 00:47:39 2015 UTC,This is honestly a lot better than the japanese teaser. Felt like the teaser was more about the voice actors more than anything else. It was so weirdly composed with showing the digimon and the brief glimpse of the cast and then showing the cast fully anyway in the most mundane way.
digimon,35456c,crewnh,10,Thu May 7 06:00:24 2015 UTC,I prefer the dub...and the dub music. Don't hate.
digimon,35456c,MisterD_Ron,6,Thu May 7 04:42:58 2015 UTC,The movie was a work of art with that soundtrack. Way too perfect. It is what got me into ska.
digimon,35456c,Lulizarti,4,Thu May 7 05:14:29 2015 UTC,"Same here, internet stranger"
digimon,35456c,IncogM,3,Thu May 7 12:29:51 2015 UTC,Me too (granted never saw the sub version nor do I feel like I need too I love the dub too much)
digimon,35456c,Gamekatt101,5,Thu May 7 14:06:43 2015 UTC,Now that's a trailer! :D Official one was way too boring.
digimon,35456c,wood_and_nails,4,Thu May 7 08:01:39 2015 UTC,"The official one was way Japanese, and very much inline with the tone of the original.  This was very Americanized, and very much inline with what we grew up with."
digimon,35456c,thecomposer42,4,Thu May 7 18:37:05 2015 UTC,"At first, I was expecting something terrible, but that was actually pretty good!"
digimon,35456c,Lulizarti,3,Thu May 7 01:55:10 2015 UTC,"I should point out I did not make this, make sure you support the creator and show him some love."
digimon,35456c,MagicCoat,3,Thu May 7 14:07:35 2015 UTC,THAT HYPE. SO MUCH. CAN'T CONTAIN. OMG
digimon,35456c,Jamesathan,3,Thu May 7 05:13:59 2015 UTC,"As a fan of both the dub and the original, this is fucking brilliant."
digimon,35456c,cyvaris,3,Thu May 7 14:13:58 2015 UTC,That was good. Like. Really really good. As someone who watched the dub as a child then watched the sub. I enjoyed this so much.  Hype is so real.
digimon,357hp2,Romiress,4,Thu May 7 19:17:22 2015 UTC,She was given her tail ring back near the end of 02.

digimon,357hp2,Romiress,3,Thu May 7 19:23:01 2015 UTC,Episode 50 of 02 - it's the last episode. ;)
digimon,357hp2,crewnh,3,Thu May 7 19:24:51 2015 UTC,thanks friend :) haven't watched 02 in years i forget a lot of her lore is in that season.
digimon,35581q,deathBotWHOMAD,23,Thu May 7 05:18:33 2015 UTC,Should we tell him?
digimon,35581q,Harpoon_Torpedo,17,Thu May 7 06:05:33 2015 UTC,Entering a Hyperbolic time Chamber is actually the opposite of what you are trying to achieve.
digimon,35581q,TheGamer821,6,Thu May 7 07:17:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe he wants to be super buff and have a whole lineage of kids,  grandkids,  and great grandkids to share Digimon with."
digimon,35581q,dotyawning,1 point,Thu May 7 16:02:07 2015 UTC,hmmmmmm a full 360 years of waiting that is a big backfire XD
digimon,35581q,Raven890,10,Thu May 7 18:30:08 2015 UTC,I think you got it a little mixed up here.
digimon,35581q,Animal31,8,Thu May 7 07:06:19 2015 UTC,Buddy... no
digimon,35581q,sjphilsphan,9,Thu May 7 06:15:05 2015 UTC,You do realize that it'll just be tomorrow when you exit? This is of course if you're talking about DBZ
digimon,35581q,AncientSummoner,7,Thu May 7 06:39:03 2015 UTC,"Entering the Hyperbolic Time Chamber speeds up time only within the chamber itself. I believe it is something like 1 minute in the real world equals 1 day in the chamber. It's been a very long time since I watched DBZ, so I could be wrong.  Anyways, you don't want to do that! Because you will age yourself even faster! I'm too lazy to do the math but you'd be like, what, 30 years older than you are by the time it is 2016.   You want to be cryogenically frozen, instead."
digimon,35581q,TonyRimor,2,Thu May 7 17:10:47 2015 UTC,Wasn't it like 1 year in the chamber 1 day in the real world?  Basically he'll be hundred of years old by the time he comes out for the English release in that logic.
digimon,35581q,AncientSummoner,2,Fri May 8 20:13:53 2015 UTC,"I think you're right. You know what this calls for? A DBZ marathon! And then I can be all ready for Dragon Ball Super this July!  So back on topic, yeah, by the time he gets out he will turn to dust and then miss out on tri, along with any future Digimon series! I would much rather take the slow path than try to take a shortcut that will inevitably result in my dying. Also, the best thing for the Hyperbolic time chamber would be to use it for getting into shape! Now THAT'S a good use for a shortcut!"
digimon,35581q,TonyRimor,3,Fri May 8 20:19:35 2015 UTC,Actually what he should do is get all of the guys behind Tri 's production then put them in the hyperbolic time chamber and in just a day we'll have tri all nice and ready for the dubbing.
digimon,35581q,MagicCoat,4,Fri May 8 20:23:25 2015 UTC,You're gonna miss Star Wars!
digimon,354wij,Morgsy0777,15,Thu May 7 03:15:41 2015 UTC,"You know, I was kinda wondering that. Mostly, it was TK looking down. It seemed off for him, being the digidestined of hope. Like the two brothers should have been switched around."
digimon,354wij,Wyietsayon,15,Thu May 7 03:53:59 2015 UTC,"Someone noted that TK has not been smiling at all since visuals were shown, which was extremely uncharacteristic of him considering he was always the most smiley one in both 01 and 02."
digimon,354wij,Sleepytimer,15,Thu May 7 04:06:23 2015 UTC,"Poor Tk! :( I wanna cheer him up. Why he so sad? Why he lose hope?  Do you think their crests will come into play? Maybe they've lost the meaning of them and need to rediscover them? I mean, they ""gave"" up their crests to help the digital world between seasons. Maybe they need to get them back.  Kind of related note: Kari looked pretty sinister, with her smile in the shadows thing. But there was pretty light sparkles behind her in the water.  Also related: Matt looked at the sky. Confirmed that he will be an astronaut. :P"
digimon,354wij,Wyietsayon,17,Thu May 7 04:12:25 2015 UTC,"Why he so sad? Why he lose hope?   Tai says the world has chosen the future that shouldn't have been chosen, so... Kari chose Daisuke? (oh god I feel dirty typing that)."
digimon,354wij,Marcoscb,-3,Thu May 7 07:14:10 2015 UTC,"Daisuke is cosmic spacedust in this timeline, Kari is more likely to choose her onii-chan over anyone at this point."
digimon,354wij,Sleepytimer,16,Thu May 7 08:25:36 2015 UTC,"Probably. Considering they're brothers and went with different parents because of the divorce, there has to be some level of complicated emotions between the two of them."
digimon,354wij,Sirenemon,7,Thu May 7 03:20:57 2015 UTC,This has been bothering me all day ~ Glad it wasn't just me
digimon,354wij,emichux3,6,Thu May 7 07:56:54 2015 UTC,I thought matt was TK
digimon,354wij,sjphilsphan,5,Thu May 7 06:38:35 2015 UTC,interesting catch.
digimon,354wij,TheGamer821,6,Thu May 7 07:19:44 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's true if the ""alternate universe"" headcanon is true. What if Takeru knows that this is a different world from the 02 universe, and is upset over it?"
digimon,354wij,akumaprincess,3,Thu May 7 17:13:59 2015 UTC,"TK was kind of a depressing guy in 02 sometimes, taking his duties very seriously and personally. I could see them expanding on this."
digimon,354wij,gallyguru,4,Thu May 7 19:29:28 2015 UTC,"meh TK grew up in 02 quite a bit in my eyes and i always saw him as the one to mature the fastest even at the end of 02 he seemed more mature than the others. i feel as if it is TK stopping his ideals to have his head in the clouds and settle himself as a young adult to not just have hope but to give it as well.  as for matt it is him letting go off his life problems (mean father, broken family life, older sibling problems, teenage angst) that he held onto in season 1. in season 1 he looked down a lot and made the logical choices like ""we can't beat him"" or ""we have to run away to think of a plan"" a view point i had as well as a kid (by the way i literally based my person off of matt or at least the way he delt with others outside of punching friends in the face...ok nope i fight my friends yea i was basically matt without the ego XD,) but while he is looking down he is his old self then when he looks to the sky his is no longer giving in to the darkness he felt in season 1 and is starting to lose his scowl and finally smile with a bright light in his mind.  if you look at the others no one but these two have a really meaningful introduction. so i think that TK and matt will have the most meaningful character development in this series. i stopped following my darkness a long time ago (im 23 now i let it go when i was 18) and i always wondered if matt and i would truly do the same thing since as i got older matt and i stopped sharing an age.   so as i grew older i wondered if i naturally turned out like matt or just similar. i know he and i split when middle school came cause i had anger then so i did not have the control to be so ""meh"" about everything. but in high-school i calmed down and got that ""meh"" mentality naturally, so im happy to see how matt turned out and what i truly kept from his example like being upfront with everyone on anything and standing up for what you wanted to protect even if others did not like you for it.  i was disappointed in everything related to digimon yesterday but thank you OP i was so out of it i did not notice this now that i do i am a tiny bit better :)"
digimon,354wij,puppyaddict,2,Thu May 7 18:43:41 2015 UTC,My theory is that Davis is gonna be the antagonist. Hence the expression from TK. Matt might be a reaction to TK feeling distressed about the situation.
digimon,354wij,ShadeSoul,2,Fri May 8 22:45:17 2015 UTC,I think it's just a reference to how they're brothers and how they both play as Lancers to the team leaders in their respective series.
digimon,354wij,Pokelucelop,1 point,Sat May 9 04:28:11 2015 UTC,very interesting
digimon,354wij,10luoz,1 point,Fri May 8 01:31:38 2015 UTC,"My crazy fan theory is that T.K. will be the antagonist for a short while, having Alphamon as his partner. The mysterious girl in the trailer will somehow convince him to switch sides, but then T.K. will go back to the original 8 keeping Dorumon and reuniting with patamon allowing him to jogress into Jupitermon. :) Although I know its clearly unlikely one can dream. I also dislike Seraphimon -_-."
digimon,355dne,surrenderthenight,4,Thu May 7 06:29:42 2015 UTC,I wish they would have fucking considered a kickstarter. I pestered Bandai Namco on their social media with Digimon Rebirth Project.
digimon,355dne,TheComedicNerd,1 point,Thu May 7 07:58:29 2015 UTC,"just stop waiting and either learn Japaneses or give up because there is only 1 translation team for digimon games as of to my understanding and they are working on the psp decoded game right now (almost done i guess) and may start sleuth next or re-digitize but it will not happen any time soon so yea i quit waiting or signing petitions i would suggest anyone else does to. (petitions do nothing but bring the want to light the company can still ignore it forever) or we all kickstarted to have fucking buy digimon game rights to localize it choices, choices, chouces"

digimon,355dne,EmeraldJirachi,1 point,Thu May 7 08:03:13 2015 UTC,you have to ask someone to summerize the plot for you though. The Story in Digimon Story is what makes it Awesome.
digimon,355tr7,c0nza,6,Thu May 7 10:33:56 2015 UTC,"In order of release, the series are:  Digimon Adventure Digimon Adventure 02 Digimon Tamers Digimon Frontier Digimon Savers/Digimon Data Squad Digimon Xros Wars/Digimon Fusion  If you want to include the movies, the order of their release is:  Digimon Adventure (movie)/Digimon: The Movie (part 1) Digimon Adventure (episodes 1-50) Our War Game!/Digimon: The Movie (part 2) Digimon Adventure (episodes 51-4) Digimon Adventure 02 (episodes 1-16) Hurricane Touchdown!!

digimon,355tr7,likeagrapefruit,3,Thu May 7 14:47:54 2015 UTC,i am pretty sure that revenge of diaboromon is after season two ended and same with runaway locomon is after tamers ended
digimon,355tr7,lemontoast_,3,Thu May 7 15:32:01 2015 UTC,And our war game is right after the end of Adventure 01. They go home and are in the human world for a while and that's when they first get to see their Digimon since coming home.
digimon,355tr7,CocoaBagelPuffs,3,Thu May 7 17:07:26 2015 UTC,"It takes place after Adventure ends, but it was released while it was still airing.  Also, 01 is an incorrect term. 02 is not called such because it was the second series, but because it took place in 2002. Adventure took place in 1999, not 2001."

digimon,355tr7,likeagrapefruit,4,Thu May 7 17:10:15 2015 UTC,"Adventure -> 02 -> Tamers -> Frontier -> whatever (haven't watched any later season)  It's the chrononological order and while new seasons usually have it's own universe (except Adventure and 02) there is some lore that gets shared over the seasons, so that you might be able to understand some things better by watching it chronological.  Some people prefer Tamers over Adventure, so watching Tamers first would be a valid choice, too.  However, one thing I can't stress enough: don't watch the english dub except for nostalgia reasons. The english dub got heavily cutted and edited, destroying many scenes effects or meaning by either bad dialogue writing or unfitting music. (The whole soundtrack got changed in the english dub, while the original Soundtrack is extremely good)"

digimon,354bwt,wood_and_nails,2,Thu May 7 18:47:47 2015 UTC,"Oh man, you were such a cute mischievous kid. Too bad your parents didn't take the time to look at what you were interested in. I knew a lot of kid's parents that were like that, what with that Harry Potter religious banning going on at the time.  Digimon came out when I was like 9 or 10. I think the first episode I watched was the first episode that focused on Izzy, Kabuterimon's Electro Shocker. And then the next day was actually connected to that!  It was one of the few kid shows on that had a very connected narrative. It kind of stunned me as a kid, and I loved it. There were some others at the time that had connected narratives, but not many kid shows.   My friends all loved pokemon, so it took some work to get them interested in digimon, but they eventually liked it too. I remember playing Digimon World 3 at one friend's house like, all the time. I got about halfway, just playing at my friend's house. Best moment ever was finally getting Angemon, who was my favorite at the time.   I think Digimon started my love for strong characters, followed by strong narratives. I had cards with the digidestined on them from some magazine, and I'd do tons of pretend stories, where the kids were separated on mountains or the ocean (the bed and floor) and worked together to get back. So much fun.  Every 5 or so years I end up rewatching the first season, and man it still stands up. It's aged really well. And I was first a little hesitant of Tri's style, and the lack of info being given, but after that smooth trailer, I'm pretty hyped too. :D"
digimon,3524mh,KreyPlayz,20,Wed May 6 13:51:52 2015 UTC,This is unethical. Showing a marathon in May and having to wait another 5 months.
digimon,3524mh,indogooner45,13,Wed May 6 13:58:55 2015 UTC,"6 months, almost 7 actually since it premiers at the end of November and we are only currently at the start of May. Then that's only the Japanese theatrical premier. Assuming there will be an international showing you might need to wait a few months more to show at where ever you live. If it doesn't show at your local cinemas (highly probable), you will need to wait for Blue-ray, which might take about another half a year after screening, which means we shall have to wait another year to watch the first part, the other 5 pending.  Yea, I'm going to kill myself now, you don't have to dirty your hands."

digimon,3524mh,tsukasa239,1 point,Wed May 6 13:52:21 2015 UTC,What is that on August 1st?
digimon,3524mh,PrincessKurumi,1 point,Wed May 6 13:56:31 2015 UTC,"They first wrote 21.11.2015 but after that, at the end there was also 1.8.2015 written (the 1st of August). Not sure which date refers to what, since I don't read Japanese. If the November one is the release date, then what is the August date for?"
digimon,3524mh,GrumX,3,Wed May 6 14:03:20 2015 UTC,The first movie has a prescreening in August on a digimon festival.
digimon,3524mh,Aciell,1 point,Wed May 6 14:09:18 2015 UTC,Another trailer or maybe a new movie?
digimon,3524mh,tsukasa239,1 point,Wed May 6 14:08:06 2015 UTC,They also showed a date of 8/1 onscreen a few seconds after 11/21. I don't know Japanese so I have no idea what it specifically said would happen on either date.   Can someone who saw the stream and knows Japanese confirm whether they specifically announced the premiere for November? Because Odaiba Day makes a lot more sense.
digimon,3524mh,AvohkahTamer,2,Wed May 6 14:04:03 2015 UTC,The 8/1 date is a prescreening for Japanese.

digimon,352710,oneofmanythrowawayyo,46,Wed May 6 14:12:24 2015 UTC,"I won't lie, for me this is a pretty big disappointment."
digimon,352710,chaosgallantmon,14,Wed May 6 14:23:23 2015 UTC,"Funny thing is the fact that they released an English trailer (with all the dates removed) makes me think that they'll release it as a series of DVDs with subtitles in 2016.  Most likely reasons -  1) to deter people from watching the anime online after television broadcasts it  2) to get you to buy the DVDs  3) to get places like Funimation or CrunchyRoll to air them at a fee  If anything, Toei is using a modified distribution model they had for Sailor Moon Crystal, which was streamed only and not on television either."
digimon,352710,GalacticNexus,6,Wed May 6 14:27:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know how unpopular this opinion is, but I hope they release a dub as well as a sub. I know dubs are inferior and all that, but it's what I grew up with and wanted a continuation of that."
digimon,352710,UndeadSpace,5,Thu May 7 09:23:03 2015 UTC,"Toei knows the hype is real. After seeing the success of how Crystal went internationally, they know they can cash in on this big time. They are going to make this hard for fans to access or at least make it shitty for us to find ways to even watch this."
digimon,352710,AstonishingSpiderMan,4,Wed May 6 15:36:46 2015 UTC,wouldnt the success of the movies help push a new series and make it a reality? so it could be the six movies with it continued in a limited anime series.
digimon,352710,MagicCoat,3,Wed May 6 21:30:25 2015 UTC,"Even if the movies help greenlight a new series it'll most likely be an independent one (Tamers, Frontier, Savers, etc.) rather than a continuation. 6 OVAs/films is a lot of room to tell a story, especially one where it's a reunion.  ...Or you end up with something like Adventure 02"
digimon,352710,tw04,3,Wed May 6 23:01:46 2015 UTC,I would buy a multiregion blu ray player and import from America if this happened.
digimon,352710,Animedingo,1 point,Thu May 7 14:16:19 2015 UTC,"For those interested, the official English subbed version of the trailer can be found here on the English version of the official website."
digimon,352710,-Chinchillax-,7,Wed May 6 22:42:51 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I think 6 OVAS have the potential to be way better than like a 25 episode series. It will have more of a budget and probably better story telling."
digimon,352710,shuscher,4,Wed May 6 20:02:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it could be a very good show, I'm looking forward for it :)"
digimon,352710,Stuart444,24,Wed May 6 22:20:20 2015 UTC,I was really looking forward to watching a weekly show.
digimon,352710,ShadeSoul,8,Wed May 6 15:14:46 2015 UTC,"I'm still excited. Bummed it won't be a TV show, but it's better than nothing."
digimon,352710,DeafJerzy,4,Wed May 6 15:37:50 2015 UTC,"In case you were wondering, the August date is for an event called Digimon Adventure Fest. Apparently you'll get a sneak preview of the movie there.   I don't think any details for the Digimon Adventure fest was announced. We just know it's an Adventure Festival. (just going off the website anyway, no details announced)"
digimon,352710,how_u_doing,3,Wed May 6 16:27:57 2015 UTC,I'm ok with this in the fact that 6 movies can tell the same amount of story that a season could without too much of a compression problem. What worries me is that the six movies could have a lot of wait time between them. Also it's rough to find out we need to wait half a year when I was under the impression that it was going to start in the next couple of months.
digimon,352710,user2338,3,Thu May 7 00:34:59 2015 UTC,This film will available closed captioning once the disc/download has came out? I'm really deaf...
digimon,352710,pkmnnerdfighter,1 point,Thu May 7 05:44:39 2015 UTC,That would be awesome. Maybe there's something we can do about it? Sometimes all it takes is to ask. Just today I asked a YouTuber to add closed captions to his video and he asked me to explain myself better.
digimon,352710,Onpu,5,Mon Jul 20 00:29:27 2015 UTC,So  everyone might not get a mega :/
digimon,352710,dotyawning,11,Wed May 6 16:38:53 2015 UTC,"Six movies, six megas. We can do this. Maybe."
digimon,352710,mercury996,2,Wed May 6 16:45:00 2015 UTC,"Or they will have two in some of the parts ie TK and Kari together or TK×Matt, Tai×Kari, Sora×Mimi etc? There are possibilities they will slap a double or two in there to keep up the hype midway."
digimon,352710,KazyX,6,Thu May 7 14:31:25 2015 UTC,"Was it ever going to be a tv series though? I'm almost certain that detail was something fans were speculating or spreading rumors about, and got overly hyped for without any announcement."
digimon,352710,Masterofknees,3,Wed May 6 17:10:00 2015 UTC,I think it was just the natural assumption of everyone since the initial announcement.  Either way I am still excited! just taking a bit to digest that it wasn't what was expected.
digimon,352710,MagicCoat,2,Wed May 6 23:47:02 2015 UTC,I am okay with this.
digimon,352710,bliso14,2,Wed May 6 19:18:29 2015 UTC,"What a bummer. I mean, I guess it wouldn't have such high quality animation if it was a show, but I feel like this will sit really awkwardly in comparison to Adventure and 02 as the years go by. With that said, I do prefer 6 high quality episodes over 50 low quality ones. And hey, if it's successful there's always the chance that they can do more of these."

digimon,352xme,Wyietsayon,10,Thu May 7 19:06:21 2015 UTC,"Considering she has a new digimon, either the antagonist or a new digidestined."
digimon,352xme,TheComedicNerd,9,Wed May 6 17:40:08 2015 UTC,"Dunno. Someone new I assume. Her school outfit doesn't look like Sora/Mimi's, nor Kari's, so she probably is from another school.  Might be easier trying to identify the digimon. Is it missing a leg? And it's limbs end in claws. Or are those three tails? Is the fact that there's three limbs important, since you know, tri. It's got like a tiger face. Looks kinda hungry or hunterlike to me. Also, looks like it's a Rookie stage.  Also, she's standing underneath the bridge that everyone else is on. Lurking in the shadows. That really implies antagonist, or someone forgotten or ignored? Either way, she's not friends with our guys, or she'd be up there too.  So, we know she's at least one of the people with a digimon, which there were a surprising number of at the end of 02. And at the end of 02, the digidestined fully introduced the real world to the digital one, right? Everyone gets a digimon! Could she be against that somehow? Maybe thinks only selective people/digidestined should get digimon? I dunno, I'm tossing potential fanfic thoughts here. But, with the ending of 02, there's lots of room for conflict, since big changes also mean big conflict."
digimon,352xme,Kaeltro,5,Wed May 6 18:26:22 2015 UTC,Good question. No good theories yet...  I'm thinking she'll have a Dark Ocean of problems.
digimon,352xme,RikkuEcRud,1 point,Thu May 7 08:29:01 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping the Dark Ocean isn't the main plot of the movie/show. I liked the very Lovecraftian way it was just...there. Never explained. Never forgotten. Even today, over 10 years later, it's still there in the back of my mind. If Cthulhu had a way to torture Digimon fans, that would have been it."
digimon,352xme,holisk,3,Sat May 9 12:59:26 2015 UTC,I feel like she's one of the Dark Seed children Oikawa abducted.
digimon,352xme,Muur1234,2,Thu May 7 21:16:29 2015 UTC,Maybe girl from the heights/tower project that kids were part of and saw the digimon fight as well. Making 9 digidestined?

digimon,352xme,crhonox,2,Wed May 6 21:50:19 2015 UTC,"Well, Considering that the boundary between the digital and real world was broken at the end of season 2 the fact that she has a digimon probably isn't too special. However, from the manner in which she was shown in the trailer I would think she's an antagonist."

digimon,3524nq,ByMaximili,7,Wed May 6 14:00:08 2015 UTC,"I was so ready to be disappointed, but from what little I saw of the animation, I loved it. Like the different style for the Digimon, like how the characters (naturally) have more life to them now that we see them in the trailer as opposed to the posters. The heavy black outlines looked to me like the trading card game style. The fight scenes looked smooth. Did anyone catch who Greymon was fighting at the bridge? Alturkabuterimon?   Mucho hype. I can wait."

digimon,3524nq,leanlikeaxolo,7,Wed May 6 14:06:47 2015 UTC,SO MUCH COLOR. The revamped character designs are gonna take some getting used to but I'm more than willing to get used to them because overall everything looks GORGEOUS. I'm still not sure how to feel about it being 6 movies/OVAs but right now all the signs are good. I'm actually wondering if originally this was just a throwaway project they were doing and then the hype convinced them to do it justice? Either way I'm ready for November.
digimon,3524nq,happylittlemexican,7,Wed May 6 14:15:16 2015 UTC,That sweet sweet HD quality made my day.  Also chills down my spine when Agumon touches Tai's face at the end.  I'm ready.

I think that will help them cut down on any filler episodes, and drive the plot forward at a good pace. Most of my favorite series are done in a much shorter time than any Digimon series, which are usually 54 episodes but could've easily been trimmed. Some examples are; Cowboy Bebop, The Tatami Galaxy, FLCL, Space Dandy, and Legend of Korra (not anime, but whatever)."

digimon,353wvl,shuscher,2,Wed May 6 22:05:24 2015 UTC,"A little. I used to have that patamon that transforms into angemon, but I lost a wing and threw the rest away. But man, that was a cool toy. I think I had some digivice too. Not sure what happened to that. I bet I figured that, since the battery died, it was junk.   I did keep my card though. They're in terrible condition, but they're cute. I had the basic digimon card set, which didn't have Gatomon, but did have her as another type of card. A training card or something? So I taped a paper cover over the card that left only the image, and had my own attack info on it. I also made my own cards of the missing megas and some in training levels."

digimon,352gpx,DivineArbalest,7,Wed May 6 16:05:54 2015 UTC,Maybe they'll be working towards how in the bloody hell Yamato became a astronaut. ;D

I didn't hate the prologue all that much, some of the jobs were really weird but I didn't hate the ships.  I mean how many people really marry the person they went through the first years of high school with? It makes sense they'd grow up and meet other people in many cases.  Shippers were so angry back then.  As long as they try to patch up a bit of what went on in the end of 02 I'm okay with that. I don't mind them retconning that epilogue either since it really wasn't important in the long run."

digimon,352gpx,SydMontague,4,Wed May 6 16:18:46 2015 UTC,"To be exact it's found on the Digimon Adventure (15th Anniversary Project) website, which currently uses it's frontpage to promote Tri. The page you took the screenshot off however, is not about Tri directly but about a Digimon themed event.  So it this screenshot isn't exactly a proof that 02 will have happend in Tri (nor are the goggles a proof that it never happend). Both are just indicators we can use to make our assumtions."
digimon,352gpx,ydoccian,4,Wed May 6 15:55:51 2015 UTC,"Well, in the trailer, Tai says ""The world has chosen the reality and the future which shouldn't have been chosen.""  That leads me to believe that 02 will be canon, but that the ending will change."
digimon,352gpx,RikkuEcRud,3,Thu May 7 05:00:46 2015 UTC,"This leads me to believe Ryo and Milleniummon's exit from the Adventure universe probably had some effect on the timeline withing Tri's timeframe. Either that or Milleniummon is back, but it's generally Ryo's job to handle him, not the rest of the Chosen's."
digimon,352gpx,NighthawkXL,1 point,Thu May 7 21:29:37 2015 UTC,"Consider this... we see Omnimon, now we know from Izzy in 02 that Omnimon is a form of DNA Digivolution (in this reality). Our War Game came out in March of 2000, with 02 airing in April of 2000, so if 02 is not longer canon they'll need to come up with a new explanation as to how Agumon and Gabumon became Omnimon. The question is was DNA Digivolution already planned out during Our War Game and we just didn't get to find out it's true name until 02."

digimon,3547na,theghostecho,8,Wed May 6 23:34:40 2015 UTC,To the sure to be hate of this request I have to ask seriously? Why in hell are you guys hating so much on the dub that got you watching digimon in the first place. I'm not saying it's a good song I'm not saying it's bad and I'm not saying it's better or worse than butterfly but come on. Can't we all just come together and hate something more reasonable. Like an epilogue perhaps?
digimon,3547na,megas88,2,Thu May 7 03:25:13 2015 UTC,"The dub made it super childish which, I get the point, but what kind of fight theme is ""Hey Digimon! Hey Digimon! Monster friends to the boys and girls!""? The US opening was alright. I watched the Latin American Spanish dub, which replaced the opening theme words with a Spanish alternative and didn't put the silly quick and senseless puns that the US version does in the dialogue. I just marathoned Adventure over the past couple days with the English dub and half the time I was annoyed at the silly comments every character had to make about everything, which also happened 13 years ago when I watched it in English for the first time.  The characters trying to put the term""digi-"" into everything to build the franchise (see Izzy's ""prodigious"") was terrible. The amount of censorship was almost offensive. I had to watch the JP ending to learn that Izzy is overly respectful to Tentomon (defining character traits gone missing in translation!) and, as far as it goes, the Japanese series ending for Adventure was far more heartbreaking than the American ending. I have to say though, watching it recently in English was a little painful, but I don't regret it."
digimon,3547na,Sebleh89,3,Thu May 7 21:27:07 2015 UTC,"I will agree with you on all points but one.  The ending. I don't care how American they made the dub. Japanese, English, hell freakin Klingon and that's a stretch to make emotional but that ending hits home every time based solely on the visuals you're given. You don't even need words for those scenes. Especially palamon. I get what you're saying I really do. I recently marathoned the sub and loved it but the ending will always stick in my mind as the most emotional ending to anything I've ever or will ever see.   Going back a bit I gotta ask, when did they use hey digimon as battle music? I remember change into power during puppetmon but that's it. Hey digimon was at the very end with Mimi's hat flying in the air to my recollection."
digimon,3547na,megas88,2,Thu May 7 22:40:59 2015 UTC,"Every time someone digivolves into Ultimate stage, starting with the first time Wargreymon appears. They play the ""Digivolve into Ultimate!"" until the sequence is over, then they play ""Hey Digimon!"" for the duration of the battle (at least the Netflix version has it this way).  Also, Joe's good bye to Gomamon is what did it for me. In Japanese it's respectful, in English it's awful (Joe's comment of ""where will you find a friend like me?"" or something along those lines, it sounds pretentious)."
digimon,3547na,Sebleh89,-5,Fri May 8 01:26:01 2015 UTC,"You want an serious answer why many people hate the US dub? Well, first of all many people, including me, didn't grew up with the US dub but with a dub that was close to the original. And from that viewpoint I don't find anything else than HATE for the US dub for it's use of sterotypes and censorship (that is called propaganda btw.) as well as the removal of a really good soundtrack for some generic 80's cartoon soundtrack that didn't even match the scenes (in german we call that ""Kunstschändung"" - translate ""art rape"").  The epilogue on the other hand is just really bad writing..."
digimon,3547na,SydMontague,3,Thu May 7 08:34:17 2015 UTC,"Understandable, but for those who did watch it first and not internationally I just wanted to put it out there. I know there are other versions in other countries. Both have their merits as well as their faults. To each their own but if it got me into this great series I have no problem with it and look back on the dub with nothing but fond Saturday morning memories."
digimon,3547na,megas88,-3,Thu May 7 13:31:29 2015 UTC,"I can't argue against nostalgia, and I can't blame anyone for that. After all, it still made many people remember Digimon several years later. (Although I think it would be by far more, with a decent english dub)  However, I sometimes feel like in Plato's cave. The US dub is nothing but a mere shadow of the original. But when someone comes to those living in this cave, explaining them, that what they see is not real and they should turn around to see the true beauty of thing, he gets killed - or downvoted in reddit's case."
digimon,3547na,SydMontague,2,Thu May 7 14:10:11 2015 UTC,"If you don't like the English dub, that's fine. But to claim that your opinion is the only correct one, and that if anyone disagrees with you, that it means that they must be ignorant and unenlightened? That's just arrogant and insulting, and you shouldn't be surprised if people downvote you for it. People can watch the English dub while acknowledging its flaws, and some may have watched both, seen both sides to it, and developed their own opinions. And if their opinions happen to differ from yours, let them be; no harm is coming to anyone from it."
digimon,3547na,likeagrapefruit,2,Thu May 7 15:08:53 2015 UTC,"I was talking about the people who are not aware that the dub has mayor differences compared to the original and refuse to acknowledge them even when they get pointed out to them.  When someone has an informed opinion that another thing - I still think they're wrong when prefering the wanky shadow over the clear original but - as I already acknowledged - I can't argue nor blame for nostalgia. However, I can - and will - blame people who deny objective facts.   That being said I should've also pointed out, that those ignorants, who sometimes make me feel like in Plato's cave, are often enough NOT part of the Digimon community, but mostly those random people you may know from comments like ""Digimon is shit"" or ""Digimon is a Pokemon ripoff"". And from my experience the mayority of those people only know the english dub.  Also, I'd like to point out that downvoting alone won't change my view on that matter. Actually it does the opposite unless you provide some arguments. (That's obviously not for you, as you answered me ;))"
digimon,3547na,SydMontague,5,Thu May 7 16:08:06 2015 UTC,"Check out SpeedRacerFlubber's edit of the trailer on YouTube. It has the effect you are looking for, although it doesn't use exactly the song you're looking for."

digimon,352dt1,compoundgc161,6,Wed May 6 15:07:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's never been ternary before. Hey it is Digimon Adventure tri, right?"
digimon,352dt1,butterfly1763,3,Wed May 6 15:12:16 2015 UTC,"Numbers can be displayed in many formats. 0b10101010 (binary) is the same as 0xAA (hexadecimal), 0252 (octal), 170 (decimal) or 20022 (ternary). They hold all the same information, but we observe them differently. The digital world could work in the same ways.  But different worlds are not only limited by the way we display it's basic building stone, but also how we read them. We would read 0b10101010 from the first number (1), but what happens when we start at the 2nd number (0)? Suddenly we would read 85 instead of 170 without changing the underlying information.  So yes, I think it's not only significant but the very reason it's called Tri and therefore a mayor plot point."
digimon,352dt1,SydMontague,2,Wed May 6 18:04:20 2015 UTC,"I think it's an easter egg allude to the name Tri, but who knows - maybe it has to do with the story. Something about the digital world itself evolved from binary to ternary."
digimon,352dt1,3g0,1 point,Wed May 6 15:48:59 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking either something about the digital world, or maybe even a whole other world created by a different computer? Ternary was used at some points in the past, and some theorize it would be efficient in the future with quantum computing. There's some potential here. It would be a clear oversight to just throw some 2s into that code and not have Izzy notice it, then again would not be surprised if it was never touched upon. ."
digimon,352dt1,KyuVsKing,2,Wed May 6 17:05:45 2015 UTC,There's also the possibility that it's a sign of how the world has changed and how the digital age has boomed in our reality as well. The background reminded me a lot of Cyber Sluthe as well and makes we wonder if we will see evidence of the game in the OVA's as an easter egg. Its possible considering Omnimon was fighting an Alphamon who was an Antagonist alongside the RK in Cyber Sluthe though again just a possibility.

digimon,352j5f,jimdoru,1 point,Wed May 6 15:58:55 2015 UTC,Hmm OK I'll have to look into that. I wonder if it works with iPhone.
digimon,352j5f,jimdoru,2,Wed May 6 16:13:09 2015 UTC,Mhm sadly I don't think there's an iphone version but the developer stated he is working on it.

digimon,350s8x,mercu7y,2,Wed May 6 08:28:10 2015 UTC,"Me too, even though the shipping to Europe is half the price of the T-shirt itself...  Anyway, I always wanted a Crest of Hope tee."
digimon,350s8x,BrokenPudding,1 point,Wed May 6 12:01:30 2015 UTC,"i live in Australia but it is totally worth it. all together it cost less than half price of a brand shirt here. i got the crest of courage, i was contemplating getting the whole set but i then realized i was poor."

digimon,351j1e,tsukasa239,8,Wed May 6 09:44:21 2015 UTC,"Joe. Totally Joe. Worrying and fussing all the time, plus the crest of Reliability. All right up my alley."
digimon,351j1e,Bellman_and_Smith,4,Wed May 6 10:51:34 2015 UTC,"I am like you. Takeru will be my first choice. I really felt like him when I was little, and the years didn't change my mind"
digimon,351j1e,TeaKey7,3,Wed May 6 11:15:42 2015 UTC,"If I could choose anyone from any season, I'd choose Takato from Tamers. He's shy and kind, and not overly assertive, but takes responsibility when he can, and that makes him the leader. Plus, he's artsy and imaginative. It's like me, exactly!   From the first two season, I dunno. I guess TK, since I'm a little brother and was once a little kid, and I know how it feels like not being able to help your family, and only having hope that things will work out. But, I don't have that problem now, obviously having grown up and able to help out, so I don't connect with TK as much anymore."
digimon,351j1e,Wyietsayon,5,Wed May 6 14:45:01 2015 UTC,I personally feel like I'm some sort of DNA digivolution of Matt and Ken personality-wise.
digimon,351j1e,baritoneninja,5,Wed May 6 10:17:44 2015 UTC,I would be Sora so I could punch Matt and pick Tai.
digimon,351j1e,catswithstaches,2,Wed May 6 12:46:31 2015 UTC,I am a Mimi with a little of Sora who wants to be Sora with a little Mimi
digimon,351j1e,Katy_Pervy,2,Wed May 6 18:12:06 2015 UTC,"Absolutely Tai. I think if a survey was taken of everyone on the planet to like Digimon, he would be the top choice, by far."
digimon,351j1e,iDomino,2,Wed May 6 12:20:39 2015 UTC,Taiki from Xros Wars because I don't see why only season 1 and 2.
digimon,351j1e,MagicCoat,5,Wed May 6 11:21:19 2015 UTC,I should have stated that because tonight's the announcement for the 3rd part of season 1 and 2 hence only season 1 and 2 was asked.
digimon,351j1e,MagicCoat,2,Wed May 6 11:27:11 2015 UTC,That's fair enough then.  I don't really feel I identify with any of the season 1 or 2 cast to be honest!
digimon,351j1e,aqua_siege,1 point,Wed May 6 11:30:02 2015 UTC,That is also fair. :)
digimon,351j1e,shuscher,1 point,Wed May 6 11:49:09 2015 UTC,I feel like I'm Matt out of anybody. Have a little brother that for a long time didn't understand and felt like was always a burden or just in the way. And that darkness tunnel would have totally happened to me at his age.
digimon,351j1e,arbyD,1 point,Wed May 6 15:38:10 2015 UTC,"I would choose to be TK. Patamon was always my favorite in the original series, and I always liked TK's character, especially in 02. Plus I would get to be a key player in both series, yay!   But more realistically, I'd be Matt since I have a little brother."
digimon,351285,Kymiex,5,Wed May 6 05:33:15 2015 UTC,I'd love to see an alternate evo route for gabumon w/o pelt
digimon,351285,jimdoru,6,Wed May 6 08:12:44 2015 UTC,"It does gather up Garurumon's data in its fur pelt, but I don't think that affects its ability to evolve."
digimon,351285,likeagrapefruit,3,Wed May 6 11:45:11 2015 UTC,OH!!!! I just realized what the best throw blanket would be. Thanks!
digimon,351285,Wyietsayon,3,Wed May 6 14:47:53 2015 UTC,"As it never appears in the Anime (and even when it would, it would only be true for that particular instance of the franchise), I'd say it's fanfiction.  That being said, if you were about to steal Gabumon's pelt, I'd personally hunt you down. ;)"
digimon,351285,SydMontague,6,Wed May 6 07:45:23 2015 UTC,"It's not fan-fiction that Gabumon is a reptile wearing a furcoat made out of a garurumon.    His original card   Now, that being ""why"" he digivolves into garurumon is definitely fan fiction.  Random guess he digivolves into Tortomon without it."
digimon,351285,IncogM,5,Wed May 6 12:06:16 2015 UTC,"The card is right next to me is physical form. :P Ofc it's Garurumon's pelt, but the implications out of it (-> he evolves to Garurumon because of it) is fanfiction."

digimon,352c6f,SeregKat,1 point,Wed May 6 15:04:25 2015 UTC,"Hmm, interesting. It looks like Kari's Digiegg, but black instead of white.  Aaannnddd now I need to go look up more info on Alphamon, haha."
digimon,35267z,daedalus316,2,Wed May 6 14:05:46 2015 UTC,November 2015.   The August date is for some event.
digimon,35267z,SydMontague,1 point,Wed May 6 14:07:51 2015 UTC,Apparently a pre-screening for an OVA from the other thread? So did we not get any information on the actual show?
digimon,35267z,SydMontague,2,Wed May 6 14:10:24 2015 UTC,"We got a 3:30 minutes trailer, which includes actual footage of the show/whatever and information regarding cast. And probably some things I missed due to my non-existant japanese knowledge."
digimon,35267z,aqua_siege,1 point,Wed May 6 14:14:27 2015 UTC,The trailer was fantastic! The art style worked even better in motion!
digimon,35267z,Andrew13112001,1 point,Wed May 6 14:18:05 2015 UTC,It's apparently some digimon festival in Japan where they will preview the 1st movie
digimon,35267z,SydMontague,1 point,Wed May 6 15:59:03 2015 UTC,The August event...Let me guess. August 1st?
digimon,34yq7q,TheGamer821,9,Tue May 5 17:48:46 2015 UTC,i just want tri to happen now :(
digimon,34yq7q,lemontoast_,4,Tue May 5 18:25:19 2015 UTC,"If it is delayed , then maybe it will air on the same date the digi-destined went  to the digital world (July something..) , that would be cool with me ."
digimon,34yq7q,jimdoru,1 point,Tue May 5 22:52:52 2015 UTC,August 1st. The preview
digimon,34yq7q,huzaifa96,6,Thu May 7 16:43:05 2015 UTC,:( Now they need to show us something that can make up for this tomorrow. Anyway we will learn the official date in less than 18 hours...
digimon,34yq7q,krfz41,3,Tue May 5 20:20:19 2015 UTC,"Maybe or maybe not. They WILL show a PV, that is the only certain thing. They may withhold the date for a later PV.  I'm hoping they will tell us the official date or even just the official season (ie summer, fall, etc). but if they don't have one nailed down, they may not want to commit and have to go back on it like they did with the spring season start date they originally announced."
digimon,34yq7q,Stuart444,1 point,Tue May 5 20:37:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's not certain, but what else ""the schedule"" can mean in the announcement from the latest egg."
digimon,34yq7q,krfz41,2,Tue May 5 20:43:58 2015 UTC,Who knows. I'm just keeping my expectations low so I can be surprised if they give us anything more than the PV.
digimon,34yq7q,Stuart444,3,Tue May 5 21:11:18 2015 UTC,Toeiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
digimon,34yq7q,Tensuke,3,Tue May 5 22:32:09 2015 UTC,"August 1st this year is a Saturday, that is actually perfect"
digimon,34yq7q,supersaiyandragons,2,Wed May 6 00:41:56 2015 UTC,I'd rather they take their time and do it right than try to rush it to meet deadlines.
digimon,34yq7q,xiar,1 point,Tue May 5 21:35:07 2015 UTC,Who knows; it may be set for July or something? Or pushed back to the winter... Hopefully we'll be getting answers soon!!
digimon,34yq7q,NowaSowa,2,Tue May 5 18:02:58 2015 UTC,All I'm concerned with is that this hopefully isn't caused by the writing staff having problems figuring out how to write certain characters and story arcs.
digimon,34yq7q,Masterofknees,8,Tue May 5 18:18:44 2015 UTC,"Nah, if things have been delayed this late it's not a writing problem, but likely the animation or publishing taking longer than expected. If it's scheduled to release this year chances are the script and story was wrapped up last year, animating is usually what actually takes a long time, and I'm honestly fine with the delay if it means better animation."
digimon,34yq7q,BTrumbl,6,Tue May 5 18:31:50 2015 UTC,I'm honestly fine with the delay if it means better animation.   Agreed. We've waited 14 years. We can stand to wait a few more months to make sure it gets polished up.
digimon,34yq7q,alberto549865,3,Tue May 5 20:37:18 2015 UTC,"Hey, If I survived 18 years for more Dragon Ball, I can survive another few months."
digimon,34yq7q,Hibernica,4,Tue May 5 20:52:13 2015 UTC,Toei probably just forgot they needed to spend money on something that isn't One Piece.
digimon,34yq7q,BloodBotis,1 point,Wed May 6 00:33:28 2015 UTC,"This makes me both sad, but at the same time happy  Sad: because I neeeed my fix :(  Happy: Because the longer it's delayed the more time they have to work in it and the better it will be :)"
digimon,34yq7q,Stuart444,1 point,Tue May 5 19:21:24 2015 UTC,The delay was obvious enough with the first PV airing tomorrow. It could still easily be Summer. (June or July start date then).  Hopefully they give an air date during the stream tomorrow. Though I'm not exactly expecting one but we have plenty of time between now and the start of the Summer season.
digimon,34yq7q,Manof_theFuture,1 point,Tue May 5 19:51:36 2015 UTC,Where can I watch said stream ?
digimon,34yq7q,MagicCoat,1 point,Wed May 6 02:24:16 2015 UTC,Is....is that all there was?  EDIT: Saw you said ongoing. Never mind!
digimon,34yq7q,thecomposer42,1 point,Tue May 5 20:11:59 2015 UTC,Is it possible they're seeing the outpour of support from the U.S. and saying to themselves we might have something let's not screw this up? I mean that's what I'm thinking lol
digimon,34yq7q,IAMA_MAGIC_8BALL_AMA,1 point,Tue May 5 22:52:15 2015 UTC,I doubt it. The announcement of the season was speaking to global fans from the get go.
digimon,34yq7q,Greek_frappe,1 point,Wed May 6 09:09:01 2015 UTC,Dammit. This is why I hate being a fan of things.
digimon,34yq7q,HawkeyeM,1 point,Wed May 6 07:42:17 2015 UTC,"Isn't May spring's last month and then June follows with Summer? Trailer is coming out tomorrow 6th of May and i don't think we should expect the release before early to mid June, so since spring is almost over the best thing they should do to not confuse us is to remove the ""Spring"" from the teaser.  Personal opinion."
digimon,34yq7q,KikiFlowers,2,Tue May 5 18:21:12 2015 UTC,"He wasn't talking about ""actual"" seasons but the Anime Seasons in Japan. New anime usually start at the beginning of a Season (January - March: Winter Season, April - June: Spring Season, July - September: Summer Season, October - December: Fall Season)."
digimon,34yq7q,aznoctopus,1 point,Tue May 5 19:45:23 2015 UTC,"Once Kai finishes up, it could run in it's timeslot. I'm talking out my ass though, I dunno what time Kai airs."
digimon,34yq7q,KikiFlowers,2,Tue May 5 19:53:54 2015 UTC,"Dragon Ball Super is confirmed to air right after the end of Kai during the Sunday, 9:00 AM timeslot on Fuji TV (which is when Digimon traditionally aired)."
digimon,34yq7q,rizefall,1 point,Wed May 6 07:30:57 2015 UTC,Oh is it? Well nevermind then.
digimon,34yq7q,wynaut_23,1 point,Wed May 6 09:48:40 2015 UTC,"Like Azno said, the new Dragon Ball tv-series, Dragon Ball Super, is taking Kai's timeslot."

digimon,34yq7q,rizefall,-4,Wed May 6 10:40:18 2015 UTC,ok then im out if they can't keep up with release dates they should never had said a thing.
digimon,34ww9u,TeaKey7,3,Tue May 5 06:00:56 2015 UTC,Tentomon and Izzymon
digimon,34ww9u,Animal31,0,Tue May 5 07:46:05 2015 UTC,When will the serie begin?
digimon,34ww9u,sawada91,-1,Tue May 5 11:45:43 2015 UTC,"Tomorrow, May 6th"
digimon,34ww9u,Colacso,4,Tue May 5 13:58:11 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but you are wrong. May 6th is the day they will announce the trailer, the series will not begin that date but we will most likely get the actual date for the first episode, the schedule and more info about tri. I am expecting to start early June."
digimon,34ww9u,Greek_frappe,1 point,Tue May 5 14:24:34 2015 UTC,"How could I watch the new series? Just recently discovered this sub. Loved the original as a kid, had no idea it was still going."
digimon,34ww9u,Ganon_Cubana,2,Tue May 5 15:33:23 2015 UTC,"Once it starts airing episodes will get uploaded on various anime sites, raw for the first hours and then when subbing teams sub them will get replaced with the subbed ones. I had no idea either. I was rewatching the 1st season a few months ago and i saw something about tri, did some research and learned more."
digimon,34xpsb,lemontoast_,19,Tue May 5 12:55:18 2015 UTC,"Hopefully something more substantial than text, scenes from Adventure, and like three pieces of promo art."
digimon,34xpsb,Wyietsayon,1 point,Tue May 5 14:31:51 2015 UTC,I'm not getting my hopes up. I've been hurt before
digimon,34xpsb,Dewgongz,16,Tue May 5 18:52:40 2015 UTC,"The trailer is a shot of a blue sky. Tai's hair then comes into view and pans down to Tai, whos hair is moving in the wind. It then says ""Summer 2025""  Source: My dad works for Nintendo."
digimon,34xpsb,MagicCoat,2,Tue May 5 20:14:34 2015 UTC,is this a lie
digimon,34xpsb,MagicCoat,8,Tue May 5 20:35:32 2015 UTC,"No my dad really works at Nintendo I swear, I have a copy of Pokemon Purple at my gran's house."

digimon,34xpsb,NowaSowa,2,Tue May 5 22:13:59 2015 UTC,"No sir you're, you don't get the simple and harmless joke."
digimon,34xpsb,IncogM,10,Wed May 6 08:51:09 2015 UTC,Hoping it will at least show cameos of the 02 chosen children and possibly hints towards everyone obtaining their mega stages.
digimon,34xpsb,krfz41,4,Wed May 6 09:46:09 2015 UTC,Sounds like a good trailer to me.
digimon,34xpsb,NowaSowa,1 point,Tue May 5 13:10:58 2015 UTC,yeah is dose
digimon,34xpsb,thistlycorner,3,Tue May 5 13:51:18 2015 UTC,"and then they will give us new eggs from 02 to crack...  I'msorry  Jokes aside, they need to show us something from 02. With the original season being the focus, it feels like 02 will be retconned."
digimon,34xpsb,TheGamer821,1 point,Tue May 5 15:12:00 2015 UTC,"That would be such a troll!!  But I feel like it has to; otherwise it wouldn't be called Tri, right?"
digimon,34xpsb,RainisOP,5,Tue May 5 21:05:01 2015 UTC,"Hoping for some catastrophic event/arrival of a new foe to bring them back together and insert them in the digital world once more. Also, hoping for those 02 cameos as well."
digimon,34xpsb,NowaSowa,2,Tue May 5 22:15:19 2015 UTC,I hope it'll show a release date.
digimon,34xpsb,DarkWorld97,1 point,Tue May 5 15:46:57 2015 UTC,How long do you guys think till the series air after this? On topic: Think it will include some sweet animation of some digivolving and a shot of them arriving in the digital world.
digimon,34xpsb,NowaSowa,2,Tue May 5 17:44:14 2015 UTC,With Toei you never truly know. They kept pushing the Sailor Moon Crystal release back for years and they didn't show any trailer or even any key Art until less than a month before they released it (and we didn't even get a solid release date until that point! It was set for spring but pushed back to July). I want to say June or July but with Toei? Hard to say.
digimon,34xpsb,RainisOP,2,Tue May 5 16:55:01 2015 UTC,Let's just hope the quality of animation is better than SMC. Like holy crap.
digimon,34xpsb,pakman17,2,Tue May 5 18:00:28 2015 UTC,"Ugh, yes. I was really disappointed."
digimon,34xpsb,tsukasa239,2,Tue May 5 19:24:38 2015 UTC,"That sucks, I'll just pray the hype doesn't die out."
digimon,34xpsb,pakman17,1 point,Tue May 5 20:05:58 2015 UTC,Is the trailer going to be in Japanese?
digimon,34zrpx,gatwinchester,2,Tue May 5 22:28:34 2015 UTC,It's not supposed to be yellow - it's gold. Notice the extra symbols as well.
digimon,34zrpx,Romiress,1 point,Tue May 5 22:34:55 2015 UTC,Ah ok. I see it now that I look closer. Thanks.
digimon,350fbj,user2338,2,Wed May 6 01:50:03 2015 UTC,"I think while his character arc between him and his brother was more prevalent, Takuya is technically the main character just because it started with him and it seems that he is the leader."
digimon,350fbj,aqua_siege,1 point,Wed May 6 02:01:06 2015 UTC,"oh no doubt that Takuya is the leader, but it just seems after the first half episodes it seems to focus on Koji a little more then everyone else then back to just him and Takuya for an episode, then everyone and back to Koji before everyone evolving to Susanoomon"
digimon,350fbj,aqua_siege,3,Wed May 6 02:15:33 2015 UTC,"The season, as a whole, felt super choppy to me. It just seemed like they couldn't make up their mind on how it was supposed to be such as plot wise, character development, so on"

digimon,34uslf,baritoneninja,7,Mon May 4 19:07:03 2015 UTC,"Dawn and Dusk are the Pokemon <insert color/gem here> types of games. They are opposites in the types of Digimon you will start with, with a Shin Megami Tensei style of fighting. Digimon World DS is the first of those three, and sort of like the Pokemon Yellow/Emerald/Platinum of the three games. Championship is more like a tomogachi except with multiple digimon that are specifically bred and trained to fight in matches, you do not control them.   Overall, Digimon World DS is a solid game with a pretty good story, but Dawn and Dusk have more variety of digimon.  World Championship is a game of it's own and a lot of people really did not enjoy it, though I personally did.   I haven't played these games in a few years, so I apologize for my bad review of them, but I would get Dawn or Dusk if you're looking for an RPG style game. Only get World Championship if you liked raising tomogachis and competing in RNG matches that you won't know if you'll win or not :p"

I loved the leveling system actually and how you had to met certain criteria to digivolve; like defeating Holy digimon to gain Holy exp (like to to help Angemon to digivolve) and needing specific digimon to help create new/different digimon. It was fun getting little missions and seeing and being able to train your favorite digimon.  The worst part thou was getting to a point were you were so over-powered and grinding for the specific types of EXP got frustrating and tedious."

digimon,34uslf,Animedingo,1 point,Mon May 4 20:54:47 2015 UTC,"Digimon world championship is a game I spent a lot of time with.  There were some problems I had with the game, however the novelty of it was really great. If you enjoy digimon and had a tamigotchi as a child, then you may enjoy this game.  Digimon of course is based on tamigotchi, however this is really what the game is. You hunt digimon, feed, train, battle, clean up poop, digivolve, get new things, wash, rinse, and repeat. There are many different biomes to hunt in, and they all change what digimon are there based on time of day and year.  Training requires you to pick up a digimon, place it in the gym, and wait a few seconds for it to get a stat up. There is 6 main battle stats (atk, def, spd ,wis ,HP, MP), but there's also stats that affect resistances to dark, light, dragon, etc. The different ways you train affect the outcome of digivolutions.  Digimon do revert to egg after a certain amount of time spent in an evolution. This can be considered good or bad depending how you like it. Reverting does have advantages. There are some evolutions that cannot be attained without reversions and if your egg is more likely to digivolve along the same route as they did before.  Battling is pretty lame. You have almost no control over the battle besides giving your digimon a game plan. I heard you can gain control over them, only after you complete the digidex. Most of the game is spent trying to battle your way to get enough medals to enter the world championship. This comes once every 4 years but can be very difficult to beat as you need 3 mega digimon that are fully trained and healthy on that one day. With reversions happening, you may not be able to that year.   Overall i'd give it a 6/10 but if you have the nostalgia for digimon, it could easily be a 7.5/10. Not a great game, but almost exactely what I want from a digimon game."
digimon,34uslf,Animedingo,1 point,Mon May 4 20:53:41 2015 UTC,I LOVE championship... altough.... I had fun with it because I used cheats that let me control the digimon....
digimon,34uslf,Animedingo,1 point,Tue May 5 13:48:33 2015 UTC,"I personally like World DS more than Dawn/Dusk. For only one reason. One really annoying reason.  When you evolve, you go back to Level 1, on Dawn/Dusk.  Let's say I have a MetalGreymon, and now I can finally have a WarGreymon, and what do I get? A super strong Digimon, right? Right? RIGHT??!!?  NO. I get a useless Level 1 WarGreymon who can't do shit anymore."
digimon,34uslf,Animedingo,-4,Tue May 12 11:27:46 2015 UTC,"Gonna be honest...All of these games are terrible. Digimon World DS was released just before Pokemon Diamond and Pearl, and was designed with the intent to market off of that hype, it's a complete rip off when it comes to game mechanics.   Dawn and Dusk are technically sequels to DWDS and they fix SOME things, but it's still really bland as a whole. None of the Digimon stand out, every single attack is extremely generic, save for a few iconic attacks on the mega level Digimon.   What really bothers me is the Degenerate system. Every digimon has a level cap, and very often this cap is lower than the level of your next evolution, so what the game wants you to do is Degenerate back to your previous form, then level up all over again back to your initial form, and then your max level cap will be raised. It's ridiculously stupid because even if you digivolve, your level goes back down to 1.   So example. I have a Agumon level 24. It's maxed out but to evolve to Greymon, I need to be level 25. So I degenerate back down to Koromon, raise it to like level 9 so it can be Agumon again, and then raise it another 25 levels so it can finally be greymon, where it is promptly reverted back to level 1, and I have to gain another 30 to 40 levels to reach the next stage, assuming my new level cap even lets me reach it.   It's mindless padding to make the game longer and more difficult, it's not a good system.   You might enjoy the DW DS games some your first time through, but there is no replayability to them."

digimon,34qdju,baritoneninja,5,Sun May 3 17:09:01 2015 UTC,"You can found something  without being part of it.  He could be the manager of sorts of the group. The one that explored the entire digital world and asked each of the current members to join the group. He could also possibly act as mentor for the members while he is retired from actual fighting.  Point is, he merely united the team and choose not to be part of it."
digimon,34qdju,KazyX,1 point,Sun May 3 19:01:12 2015 UTC,"Different and conflicting continuities. The bit about him founding it comes from the cards, but in other continuities/animes it's either left ambiguous or contradicted."

digimon,34o08v,SUKTIM,15,Sat May 2 22:41:54 2015 UTC,"Plot holes is not the term I'd choose to use. Some are plot holes, but most are just straight up abandoned plot threads.  The dark ocean is a large and obvious one. There's a whole dark evil alternate universe with a horrible undersea master... and then it's never resolved or dealt with. It's powerful enough to kidnap a digidestined, and yet it never gets resolved and they basically pretend it didn't happen.  Some other ones, off the top of my head:  At the end of 01, the digidestined lose their crests and realize the power was inside of them all along. In 02, the original heroes can't do much because they can't digivolve, because they... gave up their crests. They physically didn't have crests to give up (they were destroyed).  The first episode has Tai in the digital world, except then it turns out that you need a D3 to enter a portal. Greymon is able to tear down control spires, but for some reason angemon degenerates when exposed to one.  For some reason, the digital world gives outfits to the new kids, but never did this in 01.  The older kids just don't seem to think ken is that big of a deal, despite the fact that he's enslaving big chunks of the digital world. Matt has to go play with his band, sorry kids, too busy practicing to go help save the world.  Supposedly control rings are based off gatomon's holy ring, only her holy ring was lost in episode one... after control rings are already flying around.  Honestly, you could go on for hours with all the really bizarre plot holes and things that make no sense."
digimon,34o08v,Romiress,7,Sat May 2 23:03:41 2015 UTC,"Most of this.  Although I would like to point out that you don't need a D3 to enter a portal, only just to open a portal. The gate would open and close on their own randomly, and anyone with a digivice could use them. D3 however could open them at any time."
digimon,34o08v,KazyX,7,Sat May 2 23:08:26 2015 UTC,"That crest one is brought up a lot and I don't understand why people find it so hard to accept that they gave up the power of their crests, not the physical entities (which were destroyed in Adventure). I never read the scene in Adventure as saying ""there is no such thing as a crest, it was actually your own power"". The kids' chests glow with the emblems of the crests, which I thought made it clear that they still have the power of the crests even though the physical entities were destroyed. And then in 02 they give that power back."
digimon,34o08v,jeffinitelyjeff,6,Sat May 2 23:16:10 2015 UTC,"So, does Joe give up being reliable?  Because that's what the crests are - their power is that they embody traits the digidestined already has, it's just a way of demonstrating what they already are.  The only way they could 'give up' that power is if they give up that trait."
digimon,34o08v,Romiress,3,Sat May 2 23:21:04 2015 UTC,"So, does Joe give up being reliable?   Well he did start med school, dohoho!"
digimon,34o08v,HologramHolly,2,Sun May 3 14:35:15 2015 UTC,"""If we continue to act upon the special qualities of our hearts, then our Crests are unnecessary to us!"", to quote Koushiro from Episode 53.  Ofc I'm aware of 02 claiming that they gave up their power in order to free the 4 Holy Beasts, but I can't recall where and when they should've done that. -> that explaination makes 0 sense for me"
digimon,34o08v,SydMontague,3,Sat May 2 23:22:32 2015 UTC,"Greymon is able to tear down control spires after Ken is beaten   It's implied that without the Digimon Kaiser, the black towers are inactive, until Arukenimon appear. It's even an important plot point of an episode (V-mon can't digivolve to XV-mon)."
digimon,34o08v,Dial595Escape,4,Sat May 2 23:16:16 2015 UTC,"I'm actually mixing up two points in that - Greymon is able to tear down active control spires because he doesn't digivolve 'nearby', and enters the area digivolved.  But angemon degenerates when he gets nearby."

Matt has to go play with his band, sorry kids, too busy practicing to go help save the world.   This one I kinda understand. With the sheer amount of things they saved the Digiworld from, the idea that they'd respond with ""...oh not again. You know what - it's your problem now."" is completely believable."
digimon,34o08v,Xgamer4,0,Tue May 5 02:50:23 2015 UTC,"well you are mistaken in some of these.  Dark ocean, yes its not explained fully but maybe we will get rework of it in tri?  With crests, How I see it they still have powers of their crests in 02 however by ""giving up it to protect digital world"" I think it means they give their power to digital sovereign as they have been giving their power to theirs digimon to digivolve.  You need D3 to open portal, however to enter portal you need digivice not matter what type. Tai might not open portal, he just used one already opened.  With outfits it is explained, not fully but enough. In '99 adventure it didnt give children new outfits as they didnt know what is going on, when in '02 new kids wanted to enter digital world and had basic knowledge of it so their unspoken wishes have been granted. Other children didnt get new outfits because they feel fine in what they are as digital world is like human world to them.  With other kids too busy, well it just easy way to keep supporting roles becoming main roles, it could be handled better, however making them busy with theirs lives is at least something.  About Gatomon's ring. Well I dont think it was based specifically gatomon's ring but on one of holy rings. It was said like that to underline it was about holy ring, not about JUST ring.  I dont think '02 has so many plot holes as ppl say, its just bad writing made it seems so."
digimon,34o08v,Matthas13,3,Sun May 3 15:59:50 2015 UTC,Milleniummon and Ryo...............
digimon,34o08v,pinkoctillery,1 point,Sat May 2 23:31:52 2015 UTC,How are they a plot hole? They have a full story.
digimon,34o08v,Andrew13112001,1 point,Tue May 12 11:33:29 2015 UTC,"their story is not explained in 02, they just randomly appear with no explanation or anything, so the anime either expects you to know it already or just doesn't care if you do. US watchers especially would have no idea. not to mention that originally in Millenniummon's story it's explained that he is the source of Ken's spore, but then in the show they say that it's Oikawa's fault even though they showed Millenniummon's scene (for basically no reason at that point).  they could have left out Ryo and Millenniummon and had the exact same story, it had no purpose."
digimon,34o08v,pinkoctillery,6,Tue May 12 14:31:12 2015 UTC,"the whole Dagomon/Cthulhu arc, which was introduced in Episode 13 but actually never happend. (This plot hole is so big, you can literally push Daemon through it - and that's what they did) the crests were created for the original team, so where does the crest of kindness come from? suddenly everyone is a ""chosen children"" (DigiDestined), regardless of the term ""chosen"". After all this should mean you have a quest to do for the digital world, yet it only seems to mean ""you get a pet"" for most of them 02 explains the digital world (and all other worlds) with a multiverse theory (all worlds exist parallel besides each other), season one explains it with a shadow world theory (the digital world exists within the human world).    That are the ones that can't have any logical explaination, as they are contradictory within itself or within season one (and it's not complete). There are many other things, that don't seem logical or end in loose ends like: * Myotismon as final enemy (Tsunomon stated he is really dead - for that matter the return of Wizardmon is flawed, too) * where did the dark spore come from? * where did Daemon and he crew come from so suddenly and what was their goal? * the whole epilogue    But that's not everything that is wrong with 02. It's general style is very different from season one. It's quality of pacing and storytelling isn't by far as good as in season 1 and it's lacks a lot of depth. And most importantly, it almost did nothing with the things, they got from the first season. Tri does by now (without a single episode or preview) use more material from season 1 than 02 - and way more effective.  Tri is better by claiming that 02 never happend. It's not that 02 is horrible (it has some really strong moments), but being able to use the ending of season 1 without introducing plotholes (and without carrying over plotholes/problems) allows them to create the story we deserve. And actually, all content we've seen so far uses the ending of season one to create it's emotional effect."
digimon,34o08v,SydMontague,3,Sat May 2 23:23:03 2015 UTC,"Tri is better by claiming that 02 never happend. It's not that 02 is horrible    Like it or not, 02 happened, and it will probably be referenced."

digimon,34o08v,KikiFlowers,3,Sun May 3 00:06:21 2015 UTC,"Didn't they classify GT as non-canon when they announced the new season recently? I'm not really into Dragonball, so I don't really know. However, I know that Dragonball is made by Toei - like Digimon. Like we already discussed it's likely that you're right with 02 being canon. In a few days we'll probably know for sure. ;)  (And a multiverse theory is by far the cheapest explaination ever...)"
digimon,34o08v,SydMontague,0,Sun May 3 00:11:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I dunno. It's never been outright said it's not canon, but who knows really."
digimon,34o08v,KikiFlowers,1 point,Sun May 3 00:23:51 2015 UTC,the guy who created dbz and this new season himself said to completely disregard GT? or was that a rumor? because well people did not like GT and  neither did dbz creator. here it is the same many fans if not most i talk to don't like 02 much and despise the epilogue. so if the shows creator wants to get kudo points by retconning or wiping 02 it could happen just up to if the creator of the shows goes with the idea.
digimon,34o08v,KikiFlowers,1 point,Sun May 3 02:43:02 2015 UTC,"Toriyama has never said to disregard GT, from some googling it seems he's called more of a side story though."

digimon,34o08v,NowaSowa,3,Sun May 3 18:17:29 2015 UTC,"Ken was supposed to be one of the original(adventure 01)  digidestined. Thus he had original digivice and the crest.  I think it's cool idea but it was excecuted poorly.  The dark spore supposedly came from ryo and milleniummon.(I can't find the story/source know, but I will add it if i find it!)  EDIT: http://digimon.wikia.com/wiki/Millenniummon_%28Adventure/Tamers%29 // Millenniummon will appear and launch his Dark Spores at Ryo. Ken intervenes and gets the Dark Spores in the neck instead. Millenniummon will say his power is eternal and disappear. //   Wormmon will narrate about how Ken became increasingly cold to him, and hope for the better. Ken, on the other hand, in his Digimon Emperor clothes will stand on a cliff in the Dark Ocean, saying that he is different from Millenniummon, and that he is the Digimon Emperor. This forms Ken's backstory for Digimon Adventure 02."
digimon,34o08v,dankpiece,2,Sun May 3 14:05:05 2015 UTC,Yes! The whole thing with the Crest of Kindness threw me into a big loop there. So confusing!!
digimon,34o08v,SydMontague,2,Sun May 3 22:01:30 2015 UTC,Isn't some of it explained in the WonderSwan games involving Ken and Ryo? I'd want an animated story of that and explain how Ryo was in Adventure and Timers universe. OVA at least.
digimon,34o08v,gatwinchester,1 point,Sun May 3 00:42:43 2015 UTC,"the digidestined are the chosen children to enter the digital world and save it. it never says that a random person can't get in by some means and it never says that ONLY the digidestined get a digimon partner. but yea the mutliverse thing pissed my off since the digital world is created from the data kind of like how our universe is made of gasses and chemicals. but if its not connected to data technology than it is not data ot even at that point digital which means it is literally not DIGITAL monsters anymore.  as for that kindness crest yea no reason just ""look a crest"".  as for the epilogue i get it that matt and sora are japan fan faves so they are together but why in the world did davis get with yolei? i mean did he pull out the ring on prom night in front of her real date and ask ""yolie, will you do the thing?"""
digimon,34o08v,Andrew13112001,3,Sun May 3 02:39:31 2015 UTC,Didn't Yolie/Miyako go with Ken? oO
digimon,34o08v,SydMontague,0,Sun May 3 09:05:00 2015 UTC,"idk it has been so long but i remember yolie possibly being with davis at the very end and yea she openly liked ken but i remember in like 1 episode she said she ""slightly"" liked davis. but i have not watched 02 since its first ending and never go back but i will just to clarify...  nope she is with ken. still not a fan of unreasonable relationship and the idea that NONE of them would marry outside their friend group or at least to which i have as an understanding. we don't see mimis, or joes SO, but i care more for those relationships than the ones they actually showed which is probably why my brain thought the 2 of them might have been together."
digimon,34o08v,Andrew13112001,0,Sun May 3 16:47:43 2015 UTC,"A lot of time passed by the epilogue. So, it's reasonable to assume Yolie was the only other girl he got to know in that time. No other options."
digimon,34o08v,SydMontague,1 point,Sun May 3 02:47:52 2015 UTC,"hahaha settling sucks and davis relative to the others sucks, so it makes sense XD. but yea randomly thrown relationships i am not a fan of i'd much rather they just gave the characters random SO so it would make sense they would date outside of their immediate friend group. that or yolie said ""that ass will be mine,... someday"" cause now that i think about it i think yolie liked davis a tiny bit. it would make sense that she would turn into a woman and go after davis. she was pretty forward if i remember."
digimon,34o08v,Andrew13112001,1 point,Sun May 3 03:12:48 2015 UTC,Dark Spore is not a plot hole at all. It came from Milleniumon from the Ryo games.
digimon,34o08v,SydMontague,1 point,Tue May 12 11:34:38 2015 UTC,"The Dark Spore is never explained in the Anime, even though it plays a mayor role in it. No matter how good they explained it in a game (which is probably non-canon), for 02 itself it stays a loose end.   And if it's explaination contains Ryo, it's a massive plot hole. A character simply can't appear in multiple universes at once."
digimon,34o08v,Andrew13112001,1 point,Tue May 12 11:46:55 2015 UTC,The games are cannon.  And he can. Ryo enters some kind of portal to a different dimension at the end of one of the game. He went to Tamers there.
digimon,34o08v,SydMontague,1 point,Tue May 12 11:49:22 2015 UTC,"Never use secondary media as requirement for primary media - someone at Toei/Bandai/whoever should've learned that...  But just because Ryo DOES travel the universes, it doesn't mean he can. The only possible ways to travel the universes is a plot hole and no matter how hard you try to explain it it stays a plot hole. After all, the general laws of physics still apply in Digimon."
digimon,34ohu8,BloodBotis,4,Sun May 3 01:45:52 2015 UTC,02 isn't normally canon..? what?

digimon,34ohu8,Romiress,2,Sun May 3 06:26:56 2015 UTC,02 is still cannon as far to our knowledge no one official has said otherwise and im sure we will have to wait for tri to find out. however i highly doubt the directors would retcon 02 probably do a whole multi-verse cop-out like DBZ may be doing with the new DBZ series.
digimon,34ohu8,Romiress,3,Mon May 4 05:30:45 2015 UTC,"Uh... I think you changed your mind halfway through.  If 02 is not canon, Dragomon would never have come up."
digimon,34ohu8,hoilori,1 point,Sun May 3 01:47:28 2015 UTC,"No I mean I've seen a lot of speculation in regards to 02 being canon but nothing official has been said about it, so I'm just hoping its not canon."
digimon,34ohu8,jeffinitelyjeff,4,Sun May 3 01:50:06 2015 UTC,"It's going to be canon - if it wasn't going to be, it would n't be called 'Tri'.

digimon,34i9b2,ravenclaw1991,3,Fri May 1 15:33:11 2015 UTC,"Reboot.  For better or worse, it's a brand-new chance at redemption every time, and a brand-new concept and interpretation to enjoy.  Besides, there hasn't been one good Digimon sequel so far, the 02 and Xros Wars sequels were bunk."
digimon,34i9b2,gallyguru,1 point,Fri May 1 12:05:53 2015 UTC,to be fair both sequels were decided spontaneously and both base seasons didn't really had sequel potential. Tri could change that. key word here being 'could'.
digimon,34i9b2,GeekyWhiteBoy,3,Fri May 1 12:10:45 2015 UTC,"I want a sequel to Tamers and Frontier. Tamers kind of ended with a tiny bit of a cliffhanger teasing that they could have their Digimon partners again. And Frontier, that ended completely (its been awhile, but I think it did) but I'd still like to see them have to return to the Digital World. Adventure got a sequel and now its getting another, so why not?"
digimon,34i9b2,RikkuEcRud,2,Sat May 2 14:49:25 2015 UTC,"I generally prefer sequels, since it's interesting to follow a specific set of characters and events and see the long-term consequences, but when the sequels are poorly-planned-out, which I'd argue the sequel seasons mostly have been so far, it can cause the story to simultaneously ignore much of the previous season to try and be accessible without disturbing the original's plot while also being constrained by the rules set up in the previous season.  I'd like to see a sequel season that wasn't afraid to push the old characters in bold new directions. I understand why the writers are hesitant to do that, since (for example) Takeru/TK already had a full character arc in Adventure and adding more onto that could end poorly if fans of his character are unhappy with how he turns out, but making him a static character for 02 was a very boring and lazy solution to that problem, and I think it fails to capitalize on the strengths of building on the foundation of an established story. I didn't expect him or Hikari/Kari to be the most dynamic characters on the show or anything, and I appreciate that they probably would have been more developed had the Dark Ocean subplot not been minimized, but it's still disappointing to see, and I don't think Young Hunters fared much better despite the older kids having more direct involvement than in 02."
digimon,34i9b2,user2338,1 point,Sat May 2 08:52:20 2015 UTC,I agree. Part of the problem was also that the author team for 02 was different so who ever wrote Takerus and Hikaris Character in 02 didn't know the intentions behind those characters well. And while Tri also has a different author team this time around they at least didn't had to plan the season while the last one was still fully in production.

There's no way that there wouldn't be governments trying to get their hands on digimon for experiments or used as living weapons of mass destruction.  Really, your best-case scenario would be to get someone like Gatomon as a partner, who would probably pass for a regular cat (albeit with unnatural markings, though you could just say it's hair dye). On the plus side, her evolution is an extremely human-looking creature, so you could pass her off as your hot cosplayer friend."

At Ultimate(Mega) level they could probably withstand the force and heat of a nuke, though the associated EMP would be questionable.  As long as they don't wise up to assassinating you or get desperate enough to drop a nuke then taking over the world could be a very real possibility.

digimon,34g4m9,SydMontague,4,Thu Apr 30 23:35:56 2015 UTC,Digimon themselves are intelligent enough to realize that our world is not their own and they can be frightening to many if approached casually. Even the shows portrayal of how the public acts to digimon is spot on. If its helping us from destruction clearly people will be for it but the second they see it randomly out of nowhere they're afraid. So I think it would be best to go to with the secretive idea but introduce people who aren't likely to freak out at the sight of one.
digimon,34g4m9,SydMontague,9,Fri May 1 03:15:18 2015 UTC,"That's not up to me to decide. Digimon are intelligent and emotional beings with a free will, who would I be to tell them what to do?  Ofc I would try to explain the meaning of their decision to them. Knowing that there are more intelligent lifeforms in the universe (even though they come from the same planet and/or are digital) would change our society dramatically. Think alone of our law systems - what legal status would a Digimon have? Also we humans aren't really a good example for living peacefully together - after all we still kill and hate us because of ideology, money, skin color, gender and bunch of other nonsense. It is likely that some people would feel threatened by the reveal of Digimon, making it a risky move.  But on the other hand, would you like to live your life hidden and in constant fear of being discovered, something that will eventually happen anyways? Digimon are a great example how people (Digimon are people, too), who are so different, can get along so well - maybe humanity would be able to learn something from them.  Also, as a side note, it's not up to you too decide who will become your partner. I mean, disliking a Digimon because of his type is... uhm... kind of racist."
digimon,34g4m9,RPGX400,6,Thu Apr 30 22:27:36 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm racist against Armadillomon lol. But you do bring up good points. Discovering Digimon would be tantamount to discovering alien lifeforms. Hell, they ARE alien lifeforms, in all technicality.   I think now I'd convince the Digimon that it's best to reveal itself. I'd like to see how the world reacts. I'd like to bring into question everything we know as a society.    Some men just want to watch the world burn. I'm one of those men."

digimon,34g4m9,Xanryuu,4,Sat May 2 06:03:50 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  Of course do parents tell their kids to do certain things (whether they do is another thing...). However, there are decisions each person has to do by him/herself eventually. (E.g. Religion)  But can Digimon be seen as children and their partner humans as parent? Hard to tell, as it depends on the maturity of both. E.g. Takato <-> Guilmon could've been seen as a parent <-> children relationship, as Guilmon was basically a baby when he was born, so it's right when Takato tries to protect him from harm by hiding him, as Guilmon wouldn't understand the meaning of this decision, yet. On the other hand, if you take a Digimon like Renamon or Gabumon it would feel wrong for me to command them what to do, as they're strong enough persons to decide by themselfs.  After all, Digimon are partners and friends, not pets."

To believe that would be to ignore Imperialdramon Paladin mode (The full on founder of the Royal Knights), Susanomon which is considered a physical god, Jupitermon who is a Mega that's in a similer position as Alphamon in a different group, Lucemon Satanlord mode (which no appearance in any media has done justice to), Armagedomon and Grandracmon. This isn't even including Super Ultimates either. I love Alphamon and he has a place on my top 10 list of Digimon but he's not the strongest, mearly just Stronger then the average Mega."

If standard, Omegamon has an advantage over Dukemon thanks to his access to Long Range Weaponry as Garuru Cannon, and pretry decent Melee Weapon thanks to Grey Sword.  Edit: I just realized it says Crimson Mode, that mode is temporal but strong, but Rk Dukemon doesn't have CMode, if both standard, Crimson wins during the power boost, but if Omegamon is Rk, is way stronger than a Dukemon CM"

digimon,34deiy,baritoneninja,1 point,Thu Apr 30 06:30:10 2015 UTC,"A DnD styled Digimon game? I would role play the shit out of that. I never fully played DnD myself, getting used to it without anybody who knows how to play.  First off classes. Do you plan on making the players play a Digimon or Human with a choose able Digimon. If ladder each Player would need 2 character cards each with individual stats and abilities.   I believe there should be classes like Digidestinged with stats like courage, friendship etc. each with perks on different things.  Tamer Class where the Player character uses a deck of cards to power up the Digimon and then for the last evolution fuse.   then there could be room for a Digiwarrior class that uses the spirits like in frontier. And Dats agents that use Digi Soul to evolve their Digimon.   Army based Xros wars class would be hard but I think Hunter-like Xros Wars class would fit perfectly. Each Xros Loader can fuse only 2 Digimon together. for more than 2 you need a double Xros with a second player. You can use the fusion list from Digimon Story Super Xros wars to take canon Digixros evolutions.  These are just rough ideas but I hope they help a little."

You may also want to do a poll/survey, rather than petition to gauge interest and see how many people are actually interested. Also find out what they'd like to see in the product (packaging, digital copies, coloured variants, etc.) and what they're willing to pay. You could present this to the label while making the proposal to prove interest. Then suggest crowd funding to pay the costs, so if the money isn't raised, there is no loss to anyone.

I would think at the very least they could help you out to some degree with the process, maybe even pressing the final product."

digimon,349c6v,SydMontague,5,Wed Apr 29 15:46:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Digimon can respawn (in some lores), but not humans (actually, we don't have a reference case for that). After all, I wouldn't gamble for it. ;)  Also, while Patamon and Wormon respawned almost instantly, we can assume the ""normal"" respawn takes some more time (as hinted by Gennai in the last episode and due to the fact that we didn't see Leomon nor Piximon in 02).  Edit: We also don't have 100% proof that respawn isn't (or is) a thing in real life."
digimon,349c6v,RikkuEcRud,2,Wed Apr 29 15:51:06 2015 UTC,"That would be an interesting concept to explore in fanfiction since it probably won't be addressed in the anime. Perhaps when a human enters the digital world a back-up file is made of them. They go on adventures and then die, cue a quest for the others to resurrect them but instead of the friend they got to know it's the person as they were when they first entered the digital world."
digimon,349c6v,disneywizard,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:22:35 2015 UTC,"That sounds actually like a really interesting concept that would fit the style of Digimon pretty well. In my eyes the most interesting part would be the time after the resurrection to see how everyone (especially the revived person him/herself) handles this situation.  And there is even real life application for this scenario. Just like Tamers talked about depressions (and PTSD), this story could talk about amnesia.  Man, if I were a writer I would start writing this story down - but I'm a programmer..."

digimon,349c6v,RikkuEcRud,2,Thu Apr 30 20:45:23 2015 UTC,I actually read that same fanfiction.   It's called Digimon Forever I believe and it had the cast of the Digimon series up to Digimon Frontier and had the leader from Digimon Frontier die but be reborn as a Digimon/human hybrid.   I was actually hoping my prayers were answered when a new Digimon series was being written and it had the original cast in it that my multi-generation Digimon adventure fanfiction was becoming a reality.

Keep rubbers with you if the team is an adult one.  d. HYGIENE. HYGIENE. HYGIENE. e. Destroy evil Digimon without having some moral dilemma. Kill or be killed. C'mon Cody.

He deserved much better.  Cody and Armadillomon were a good match, though. lol. It sucks for Angemon he had to DNA digivolve into that terrible, whatever the hell it was supposed to be.

digimon,349c6v,RikkuEcRud,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:30:45 2015 UTC,"Upvoted for the rubbers. I wouldn't even say for an adult team, any team with members above 13-14 is probably gonna want them. Teens are horny, and these ones have no adult supervision. Plus supposedly getting into life and death situations together does a lot to get people into bed together too.  Of course this is assuming everything works normally in the digital world. I don't remember my source, but I was under the impression that you don't age in the digital world, and if that's true other biological processes might also be put on hold. Best not to risk it though."
digimon,349c6v,gatwinchester,2,Thu Apr 30 20:57:00 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, I'd spend a lot of time in the Digital World. I'd use that time to study every subject I possibly can. Become expert in them all. Then return to the real world and dominate society and the academic world."
digimon,349c6v,likeagrapefruit,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:24:12 2015 UTC,"Well time still passes, though the rate at which it does may not be one-to-one. So go in when you're 11, study 10 years, come out when you're 21 with your 11 year old body and nobody will believe you're you. They'll think you've got a (bad) fake ID.  Plus as the speed gets close to(or slower) than the real world you'll start to get to the point of subjects you're studying going out of date before you finish studying.  And theoretically there's an upper limit to how much the human mind can remember and thus how much it can learn.  Though If you don't age then it might also halt the growth of cancer, which could be useful."
digimon,349c6v,SydMontague,2,Thu Apr 30 21:43:20 2015 UTC,Then I'd master just a few subjects. And play catch up when I return. I'd also create a new identity.

Extra: the human you literally fight with the most will become your best friend. And let you surpass the mega rank.   Evil antagonist digimon come in all shapes and power levels.   When you meet puppetmon DO NOT start singing master of puppets to him without playing guitar so you can run due to his kinda stupid nature.   If you ever fight an ultramega villian just have patamon digivolve into angemon to instant 1 shot all champion levels and below. Then let angemon digivolve to mangaangemon to cheaply win every battle with a blackhole desguised as a gate of destiny ( works on any digimon of any power level. No exceptions  )   Bezzlemon can not have a fun or decent life until he joins yourside for good and redemption. Even if in the adventure universe.  Dont take any kind of advice from etemon nor agre to let him be your touring manager.

digimon,34buhc,Jayux,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:44:23 2015 UTC,my biggest issue with 02 is that they show Ryo and Milleniummon (and Milleniummon is kind of implied to be the reason Ken gets his dark spore) and then they later say that Oikawa/MaloMyotismon put the spore in him.  like if you are going to reference Ryo's games why do it out of nowhere and then not actually connect it to Ken's spore lol

digimon,346nne,likeagrapefruit,10,Tue Apr 28 19:10:00 2015 UTC,Definitely TK and Kari
digimon,346nne,warelecmon,7,Tue Apr 28 21:40:14 2015 UTC,"For this post I'm going to consider that Davis and Ken have a relationship equivalent to Turk and JD from scrubs.  Best of friends and they love each other but their romantic interests lay elsewhere.  I say this because as cool as it would be to ship those two I have to go with Davis and Yolei.  Their is an incredible amount of chemistry between these two as they are easily able to dive into quick and fun banter.  Yolei will even sometimes praise Davis(Though Reluctantly).  While they both share a level of hotheadedness, I believe that they have both matured enough by the end of 02 that they could have an amazing relationship."
digimon,346nne,VacantVagabond,6,Tue Apr 28 19:07:06 2015 UTC,"Ships!!! So many ships were marrooned by the torpedoes that was the epilogue! So many dreams destroyed!! Why writers! Why did you do that to us!? WHYYY?! We will take the unexplained plot, we can be hit by terrible fillers, we won't waver at these things. We endure but ruining all the HYPE and our beautiful SHIPS! We shall flame forever more!!! :P  As for favorite ship I would go for TK and Kari of course. That 13 episode guilt. The constant harmless flirt between them, the common history and the jealous Davis just screamed futured high-school sweethearts. I love the chemistry between Yolei and Kari though. They both contradicted each other really good. I still think if TK was out of the way by ""accident"" Yolei would take his place in a heartbeat.  So the ranking goes!  1. T.K. - Kari = Takari 2. Yolei-Kari= Yokari 3. Ken-Davis= Daken 4. Tai+Sora (on the background)= Taiora  As for my last pick that christmas episode where Sora takes Tai's heart and just throws it in front of a pack of stampiding Mammothmon was so sad.... It's just... Bring Angstimon's butt to wreck something, cause the feels are unbearable!!"

digimon,3458hi,MobiuusOne,2,Tue Apr 28 16:17:13 2015 UTC,"The new dbz series disregards GT as cannon and i love that but digimon means more to me since i looked to the  8 digidestened for ways to better myself as a person. Dbz taught me nothing same with pokemon and many other shows but digimon taught me some of the life lessons i still used to this day. So with tri im curious to see how i turned out comparied the groups maturity.   Like did i follow my ideal path of retaining the knolledge of izzy with matts sense of loyalty joes planned out and think before an action mentallity with the bravery equivilant to tais courage and the sincerity to be open and honest with others.  I did not wish to follow the light since i am at home in shadows nor do i wish for hope since i make things happen or push them in the right direction. I never needed romantic love with others just plutonic love.   So in the end tri is not just a new adventure for me but an update on how i progressed in my own way. Before digimon i was a small child with dreams of slaughtering people with no reason or remorse. Ever since digimon my mental, physical, and emotional health has gradually gotten better since i finally had entities i agreed with and learned from. I took aspects i liked and applied it to myself. I can say with no doubt digimon saved me from prison and an unknown amount of people from an agonizing death by my hands. I was what matt would be if he had no friends or a sibling to keep him mentally safe from his own darkness. Sorry for the rant :)"

Not sure who's strong at sprite art, but have a look around Deviantart and see who's open for commission -- as long as you're paying a fair rate, you should find someone fairly easily.

digimon,33zvj8,Chipmunksr1,2,Mon Apr 27 04:31:38 2015 UTC,"I started playing Digimon Dawn two weeks ago, and I love it. I've played it before when it came out, but its been so long and I forgot everything.  Right now I'm working on getting ShineGreymon Burst Mode, Valdurmon, Ravemon Burst Mode and a few others. I won't spoil anything, but here are a few tips.   You can hold 3 Digimon at once, but you can also have 3 Digimon on the side, in case you faint. These Digimon will also gain experience when you're in a battle, so in total, you can have 6 Digimon being trained at the same time. Highlight Haven is a pretty important location. You can get Airdramon, Puttimon and a few others here, but you can't get to this location until the end of the game. There is a Holy Digimon quest to get there, but you'll have to look it up. Degenerate as often as you can. That's how your Digimon get stronger. You can customize your Farm Island(s) to match any type of Digimon. Train at least once per day, and your Digimon levels will go up.  You can't use WiFi, so you're going to miss out on a few Digimon, like Beelzemon Blast Mode, but IIRC, you can still use local WiFi if you buy yourself Digimon Dawn. With WiFi, you can match Digimon eggs to create new Digimon. Using the map warper, you'll notice a separate island in the sky, with a bunch of Digimon, one being a Leomon. This island is the tournament island, and if you speak to Leomon, you can take a test (by battling) to raise your Tamer Rank. You're going to want to raise your tamer rank as soon as your Digimon are strong enough. There's one benefit that gives you more data when you're Digimon hunting. Example, if you're a normal tamer and you run into a Whamon (ultimate Digimon), you'll get 1% scan data each time. But if you're a Gold Tamer, you'll get like 10%. This is especially useful for baby Digimon, because you get like 35% scan data each time you run into them, when you're a gold rank.  If you're going to DigiConvert, it's best to wait until they have 999% scan data. Using the above method, and getting an in-training version of the Digimon you want, will make things go by much quicker."

digimon,33uphi,jeffinitelyjeff,40,Sat Apr 25 20:25:31 2015 UTC,"Ken as the Digimon Emperor.  After Adventure 01 it was really interesting to have a human antagonist, to see the how a negative human presence impacts the digital world. He was also a pretty interesting character and while he was messed up he at least had a reason for the things he was doing.  Arukenimon and Mummymon felt too silly after the menace that was the Digimon Emperor and all the other villains seemed to just pop in out of nowhere or their stories didn't amount to anything.  I felt like everything in 02 after Ken was a bit of a let down."

digimon,33uphi,SydMontague,2,Tue Apr 28 08:04:33 2015 UTC,"Ah well the meaning in English has a bit more to it, although the etymology is definitely German in origin.     1. an acute but nonspecific sense of anxiety or remorse  2. (in Existentialist philosophy) the dread caused by man's awareness that his future is not determined but must be freely chosen  http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/angst     BWG would fit definition 2."
digimon,33uphi,uv0001,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:10:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that makes more sense.

Maybe social political issues rising up? I know, kid's show, but Digimon pushed the envelope on so much already, that doesn't feel like asking too much.   But yeah, most of the others were short lived. I forgot Myotismon was even in this. Arukenimon and Mummymon had potential for like a second, then they were comic reliefs. And I can't remember the man's name, but something felt off about his backstory stuff. It had promise, but it felt like it took backseat too much, when it should have been something tragic like Ken's revolution."
digimon,33uphi,recursion8,4,Sat Apr 25 20:44:37 2015 UTC,Dagomon. God what a tease they never did anything with that storyline. Or Takari.

digimon,33uphi,TyuFa,2,Sat Apr 25 23:36:26 2015 UTC,"Armageddemon tops it.  Dagomon is also nice. Apparently I don't like my villain's to be well explained?   More seriously something I didn't particularly like about 02 was the lack of pressure, the kids could just go home every episode. With Armageddemon/Dagomon it felt more like, this had to be done and they had to do it. By the same criterion I should have liked the Demon corps episodes as well (so Daemon) but they just didn't leave much of an impression on me.  Mummymon/Arukenimon were a bit silly in my opinion."
digimon,33uphi,Virtusvitium,2,Sun Apr 26 03:18:49 2015 UTC,Ken hands down. We've never experienced an evil digi destined until him. Took me for a loop
digimon,33uphi,Tensuke,2,Sun Apr 26 04:00:30 2015 UTC,Ken for sure. An evil human? An evil digi-destined? Whaaaaat?  Also he made Kimeramon. Pure BA.
digimon,33uphi,monjoe,1 point,Sun Apr 26 04:52:13 2015 UTC,The Emperor obviously because there a great amount depth to his whole character arc.   Blackwargreymon was... interesting. His existential debates were boring to me as a kid and now they seem silly to me as an adult. Yet I appreciate that such philosophical questions existed in a cartoon.  I'm also a little suprised that the podigious crew doesn't dislike Arukenimon and Mummymon as much as I do. After the greatness that was the Digimon Emperor we didn't need to a slapstick duo that I really couldn't take seriously.

Although the risks were smaller, cause they could go back, but that way felt more personal. First because they didn't have to help and second because he was actually one of them. He was the team went bad. He was the dark reflection of the new kids. Ken was menacing, cunning, intimidated them, caused harm to the older kids digimon and also developed different plans every time. (First took away their digivolution, then stole their digivices, made them split up etc etc  So by far Ken, then second place is Black Wargreymon's Butt!!!!"

digimon,33wroa,Chriiiiiiiiisss,2,Sun Apr 26 11:00:17 2015 UTC,"Don't have the game, but also waiting to get it and I've done some research.  The vita isn't region locked, so you can play a game of any region on it without any issue, don't worry! As for the language barrier, it can be difficult, but I've played through re:digitize with the help of guides without trouble. However, I've heard that cyber sleuth has something that makes it easier - the vita screen allows you to use the Google translator app on a phone to translate the text.  It's not a perfect translation, but with Google translator and internet, I don't see why you shouldn't be able to enjoy the game!"
digimon,33wroa,Kunobi,1 point,Sun Apr 26 11:32:14 2015 UTC,"Awesome, knowing that about the Google translate will help a ton. How was your experience with re:digitize? I honestly forgot about it with the hype of cyber sleuth, you just peeked my interests again ha"
digimon,33wroa,Kunobi,2,Sun Apr 26 13:37:43 2015 UTC,"Re:digitize is one of my favorite psp games by far. The mechanics are a call back to digimon world 1, so digimon die and so on, but the whole game is so much fun - and last I checked, the fan translation was on the final stretch, too, so we'll get to play it in English, at last!  But yeah, the google translate thing should help a lot with cyber sleuth! There are some videos that translate the game too, but I don't think they go very far just yet - I need to double check once I'm in my laptop. In general? Don't worry! Even if it doesn't get localized, you can still enjoy the game :)"
digimon,33wroa,TheGamer821,2,Sun Apr 26 13:54:59 2015 UTC,"No you don't need a Japanese Vita. However you'll need a Japanese PSN account if you want the post game on disc DLC, which is free anyway.  I have no Japanese knowledge but there are plenty of Guides to help me out playing.  This Website: https://digimoncybersleuth.wordpress.com  This youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYb2RBT-6329t4XsRJKztQQ  And I believe there is a Guide on Gamefaqs too.  I had a blast playing this game but I would definitely recommend you waiting with the purchase until E3. There is still little hope Sony wont waste time showing EA and Ubisoft bullocks, that we already saw and actually focus on the Vita a little.  As far as story goes I could summarize it for you once you're done."
digimon,33wroa,TheGamer821,1 point,Sun Apr 26 11:38:24 2015 UTC,"Awesome this is perfect, just the information I needed. I'll probably play the game and watch the cut scenes and what not with a side by side video that has translations.   And on the DLC, is it worth it? Is it story DLC or adding more to npcs and items?"
digimon,33wroa,sketmachine13,1 point,Sun Apr 26 13:36:20 2015 UTC,Well you get 12 Missions where you have to battle the Demon Lords together with the in japan very popular female Protagonist Sayo from Digimon Story Moonlight. You get access to the Dianamon evolution and a few more play hours.   The only thing that really bugs about these DLC is that it's on disc. Sayo still appears in the offline colloseum even without the DLC. The only thing that is going to be unlocked is one Digimon and 12 Quests. I dunno if the agumon black and gabumon black DLC is going to be downloadable because that locks away 9 Digimon. Again on disc because why not. At least they are not necessary for Plat but still very annoying when you play on non jpn account and see all the content being there just locked away behind a 100kb DLC file.
digimon,33wroa,TheGamer821,1 point,Sun Apr 26 14:28:11 2015 UTC,"I've always found it strange that people have a ""dislike"" for DLC that is ""on disc"".   It's going to be released as a DLC regardless so they might as well save you some internal memory space/mem stick space by sticking the data in the disc itself. They could have just as easily left it off disc and eat up your console's memory instead.   I mean, sure, you can claim ""they purposely left it out to earn more money"" but that is nothing but assumptions. Granted, very reasonably and likely assumptions. But it could also be that it was never intended to be part of the game and was decided upon halfway through the game, and thus became a DLC.   But to actually add to this topic:  If you know ZERO Japanese, you really do miss out on a lot of the game. As in, you can finish the game but the REAL value, to me at least, is the interactions and dialogue between characters throughout the story and mini-quests."

Down from the technical difference between physical and digital life to the emotions involved, on both the survivor's side and the killers, from Juri's anger, revenge, loneliness and ultimately forgiveness, and Impmon's remorse and redemption.  edit: I meant forgiveness, not revenge.

digimon,33ra4y,Megalomaniac1983,9,Sun Apr 26 18:28:33 2015 UTC,"I think the question should be ""Which season showed the value of a Digimon's life the best?"". Because these implications handle the morality aspect of killing somebody far better than any ""we shouldn't kill him, because killing is bad"" scene.  But before we can answer that, another question arises: What is the value of a Digimon's life? Digimon are intelligent, self concious and communicative being, meaning they possess all properties that sets humans from normal animals apart and make us a person, so the only conclusion that MY morality allows is, that Digimon are people, too and therefore that there should be no difference in how we see Digimon and humans from a moral perspective. -> The value of a Digimon's life equals the value of a human's life.  Therefore we can simplify the question to ""Which season showed the value of a life the best?"". Now, how can we show the value of a life? First of all we, the observers, have to build up a value for the person's life - we have to care about the things that happen to that person. For that we have to learn about said person to find properties we can either associate with or we feel empathy for. But we tend to learn the true value of something only, when we lost it. ""Losing"" doesn't mean only death, but also physical and psychical harm as well as a (seemingly) farewell forever. -> To see the value of a life, the observer has to care about the life --> You have to create emotions inside the observer  SPOILER WARNING - The following section contains massive spoilers for the first 3 seasons! And the first 4 seasons (I'm not finished with Frontier yet, though) all have pretty strong emotional scenes, so who delivers the best?    Adventure Adventure contains many emotional scenes, but there are 3 for this topic relevant scenes that probably everyone remembers. 1) Angemon's death. One person sacrifies himself in order to protect his friend, a short time after they promised each other to be friends forever followed by the spawning of a Digitama out of Angemon feathers - both things referenced in the episode before. Remember how I said we learn to value things once we lose them? Finding something that has been believed to be lost forever creates even bigger emotions. This scene is pure art. 2) Wizardmon. I think the name alone made people remember this scene and it's quite remarkable how this scenes has burned itself into the memories of so many people. I had to watch this scene like 20 times in a row recently and the 20th time was as bad as the 1st one... 3) The children leaving the digital world. They won the war but lose their partners, people who meant more to them than just friends. The children saying goodbye, the train starts too move, Palmon appears, trips, Mimi's head is flying and Butterfly sets in. And everything ends with showing a railway crossing (reference to Episode 12 again, btw), the narrator telling us to keep believing in the digital world and the Digivice sound fading out. There is only one thing that can make this scene even more perfect: A trailer, released 15 years later, that starts with the Digivice sound fading in.  Adventure 02 02 really tries to avoid the killing of non-black tower Digimon, but I couldn't help me to not really care about them - especially when they were evil out of free will. Another thing that really bugged me about 02 was, how many Digimon, who entered the human world, were pictured as wild beasts and not a people - like in Adventure. But enough bashing, where did 02 shine in that matter? The Digimon Kaiser arc. Seeing how the original partner Digimon got beating up by the Digimon Kaiser did indeed hurt, because they are characters I really care about and don't want to get harmed. The next key scene is the Kaiser's fall resulting Wormon's death, Ken realising the value of a Digimon's life and him searching - and finding - for his heart/soul that leads to the reincarnation of Wormon. And let's not forget BlackWarGreymon, a Digimon searching for the meaning and value of life.  Tamers Unlike Adventure, Tamers doesn't have so many so strong emotional scenes. However, the design of the show and the small cast, compared to Adventure, allowed to go more indepth into the characters. Especially the Digimon are way deeper than in Adventure. The result from that is a way higher average emotional level right from the beginning. More importantly the season handles a lot with moral questions regarding artificial life (Digimon) on a really broad spectrum. And lets not forget it's take on depressions/PTSD.  Conclusion All in all I'd say Tamers wins, due to the fact, that it's writing is actively working with that question - creating more relevant scenes (both, amount and size) than Adventure.  I hope my text actually makes sense, as I basically took your question and answered another question. But It's 3 a.m. here and I've spent a few hours on this text. -> good night, I cry myself into sleep now, after remembering myself of all the sad scenes in Digimon at once..."
digimon,33ra4y,SydMontague,1 point,Sat Apr 25 01:16:07 2015 UTC,Wizardmon. :( And the sad adventure ending!   Nice write up. I really enjoyed it. I think I too will rewatch a few of those scenes and then cry myself to sleep.
digimon,33ra4y,Wyietsayon,6,Sat Apr 25 04:59:29 2015 UTC,"I remember in Tamers, when Takato and Henry would tell their Digimon to not scan data to get stronger. They only defeated Digimon because they had to. In the beginning of the show, Rika didn't care, and said Digimon were just data. She eventually changes her mind, and becomes a lot more emotional."
digimon,33ra4y,notagumon,3,Fri Apr 24 23:09:55 2015 UTC,"I've always loved the scene in 02 where Tai is talking to Hikari and questions whether the new cast are ready to fight, and kill, real digimon. It was surprisingly dark in context of the rest of the series and how the issue was never really touched on again."
digimon,33ra4y,ThatAwesomePenguin,2,Sat Apr 25 12:28:47 2015 UTC,"I remember it being touched upon a few times in the rest of 02... When the Daemon Corps is in the city, they all kind have a way of having to come to terms with it."

digimon,33ra4y,Dial595Escape,2,Sun Apr 26 12:59:20 2015 UTC,"I think Tamers does it the best. I'm going to avoid spoilers, but digimon death is pretty important there.   Adventure does it well. Feels war like.  02 was kind of the worst with that plotline. I mean, it tried, many times, but never really pushes it to it's end. It's laughable because at the end it becomes important, then is forgotten. Weird.  I can't remember frontier or the 5th one well enough to say anything definite about them. I think I remember Frontier's plot involving the death of digimon on a global scale. Like, now that country/area is gone because bad guys. And all I remember about the 5th one is it had Bancholeomon near the end, who's pretty badass, and of course he dies, as is the weird leamon tradition. And everyone was upset about it. I think it's important to the finale...? Not sure. But it bears repeating, that Bancholeamon is badass.  And haven't watched the 6th one aside from the first two episodes. It's too painful to watch. So far it's been too cartoony. So I'm think no digimon death."
digimon,33ra4y,Wyietsayon,3,Fri Apr 24 22:30:11 2015 UTC,"Actually, in Xros, there's this surprisingly deep few episodes where the main character has to convince this twisted kid that the digital world isn't just some war video game where death is meaningless.

Ken became a sociopath due to magic bullshit and deceoption whilst Yuu became a pschypath due to magic bullshit and deception. Ken didn't think killing was wrong, and Yuu thought he was in a magic world where death has no meaning. Ken knew that Digimon felt pain and emotion, and Yuu didn't.

Most of the evil Digimon are corrupted in some way,  and the kids are actively purifying that corruption from them so that they can be reborn anew. They even have fancy little speeches that they say in a superheroic way while doing it.   At least,  in the original version.  Can't recall if it's in the dub.

digimon,33ra4y,hoilori,2,Tue Apr 28 08:05:31 2015 UTC,"That's not correct.   Deaths in Tamers are final, as the dead Digimon gets often loaded. (-> they die in the truest possible form)  Deaths in Adventure (+02) and Frontier are non-final, due to the Town of Beginning respawn mechanic. However, Digimon have to die to respawn. Frontier portays a limited memory / ability transfer between original Digimon and respawned Digimon (the 3 holy angels are still powerfull and somehow connected, but they don't remember their previous life), while Adventure and 02 portray a full memory / ability transfer. However, these respawn mechanics only apply for the Digital World and only while the Town of the Beginning is intact but not for the human world. After all, Wizardmon didn't respawn. Also, in Adventure and 02 respawn isn't usually instant, as Gennai says in the last episode that the other loses (Piximon, Whamon, Chipmon, etc.) will be reborn someday. -> Patamon and Wormon were exceptions. But just because death is non-final it doesn't mean it doesn't exist or is meaningless. Most religions (who are one of the biggest influences for our philosophy/ethics/morals) have the concept of being reborn or afterlife, but we still don't see a human's death as meaningless."

digimon,33ptk6,MagicCoat,5,Fri Apr 24 20:45:03 2015 UTC,I tried to play Digimon World 4 a few years ago.  I'm still on the loading screen.
digimon,33ptk6,pkmongoose,2,Fri Apr 24 15:43:36 2015 UTC,Well duh it's only been a few years.  you have at least 6 more months before you load into the first zone.
digimon,33ptk6,TheGamer821,2,Fri Apr 24 15:44:48 2015 UTC,"I'd say All Star Rumble qualifies as a worse Digimon game, or at least Rumble Arena 2."
digimon,33ptk6,SeasickWhale,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:17:57 2015 UTC,Definitely All Star Rumble.
digimon,33ptk6,TheGamer821,2,Fri Apr 24 20:44:42 2015 UTC,I started watching and my eyes caught your LP DW2...and now I'm in part 3. I couldn't get into DW4 it hurt my inner child. But that's just me.
digimon,33ptk6,befron,2,Fri Apr 24 20:18:17 2015 UTC,"Digimon world X (or how it is called here, DW4) is a guilty pleasure for me.   The base Idea of a dungeon crawler is nice but the game suffers from missing polishing and game mechanics that do not work with the type of gameplay. When I play Diablo 3 locally on my PS3 all I do while playing is thinking ""man this could've been DWX if they didn't screw up"". But I really like the fact that you can use X-Antibody Digimon and once I got my hands on Wargreymon-X the game became far more enjoyable.  I wish there was someone out there who would make a mod for this game fixing all that is wrong with the game. I can make a quick list for refference:   EXP should be shared among friends Use left stick for walking and right stick for aiming Delete blocking and charging up attacks Increase drop rate Reduce EXP needed to LVL UP Remove Quests and make evolutions achievable differently Playing multiplayer with 2-4 players that started simultaneously proceeds the story for all players. Add a auto Mana and Health regeneration Attack animations should be a little faster and allow aiming mid animation More ""spells"" for variety Spice up the equipment system   I think that's all."
digimon,33ptk6,SeanLXXIX,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:00:14 2015 UTC,"I really liked the game myself but the extremely low amount of playable digimon and the jump from rookie -> mega on any digivolution kind of killed it for me. After beating it with vee-mon I just kind of lost the drive to grind up one of the megas.   I think if they also added more playable digimon through evolution paths and MAYBE a few more starters it would have been much better. I think its a fun game that, with a lot of polish, could have actually been fantastic."
digimon,33ptk6,EnkiiMuto,1 point,Sun Apr 26 02:55:50 2015 UTC,"I tried playing this with a friend and made it up to where you can first digivolve and player 2 can't even get a digivolution. It ruined the game for me. It took forever to get that far, I don't want to do it all over again just so my friend could digivolve too. We both agreed to never play it again after that.  Also, Monster Rancher 4 and Ape Escape 2 >>>>>>>> DW4"
digimon,33ptk6,SydMontague,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:24:24 2015 UTC,"That's a whole other reason the game suffers, because it was during that time period of ""hey we have this system that supports 4 controllers better make everything 4 player""  Monster rancher 4 and ape escape 2 beat most games to be fair."
digimon,33ptk6,OneLameStabber,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:15:14 2015 UTC,Really? I heard this game wasn't great but I started getting excited when there was digimon co-ops between my favorite ones
digimon,33rft2,jeffinitelyjeff,4,Fri Apr 24 22:24:45 2015 UTC,I will never understand all the hate Imperialdramon gets in all of his forms.  At the first stage (dragon mode) he looks incredibly cool and more beast like.  His design looks massive and truly like a powerful dragon.  During the short time he appears in the revenge of diaboromon film he looks incredibly cool flying around above the water firing blasts.  As for Fighter mode it is my least favorite because I think the humanoid shape doesnt work too well with all those colors but its still a really cool final form that is fixed completely with Imperialdramon Paladin Mode.  The white gold and blue looks incredibly regal and coupled with the omni sword and those golden claws he becomes one of the most badass and imperial(haha) looking finals forms of any Digimon ever.
digimon,33rft2,VacantVagabond,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:54:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, but he's quite weak for the leader...A jogress and only slightly above WGmon. only slightly above OMGmon after absorbing OMGmon himself."
digimon,33rft2,huzaifa96,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:26:47 2015 UTC,His build seems sluggish and inanimate (and maybe too big).
digimon,33rft2,hoilori,1 point,Tue Apr 28 07:37:36 2015 UTC,"He doesn't look nearly as cool as Wargreymon, Metal Garurumon, or Omnimon."
digimon,33rft2,ElModeloEnPace,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:26:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's partly due to the fact that his debut scenes as both Dragon Mode and Fighter Mode were against Digimon that were weaker (or at least of a lower Level than himself).  His debut as a Mega was against Ultimates and his debut as Fighter Mode was against another Ultimate.  Most of the other 'Mega' Level debuts were against Digimon of similar Levels (WGreymon and MGarurumon vs VMyotismon, Omnimon vs Diaboromon, Magnamon vs Chimeramon). Plus the fact that when he does fight other Megas, it...doesn't make his track record look good (only just managing a draw against BWGreymon WITH the help of WGreymon, barely fazing Daemon, getting disabled twice by Armageddomon - once in DM and once in FM)."
digimon,33rft2,5yk0515,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:00:57 2015 UTC,I actually think that makes me like him even more.  He isnt overpowered in any way like magnangemon.  Each time he succeeds its with the help of others.  I do agree his entrances could have been a little cooler.  But concept and design wise hes one one of my favorites.
digimon,33rft2,VacantVagabond,6,Thu Apr 30 19:03:23 2015 UTC,"Never vote against HolyAngemon.  Unless Stingmon is an answer, then it's a draw."
digimon,33rft2,biggest_dreamer,5,Fri Apr 24 23:47:51 2015 UTC,(In Ashley's voice) Stiiiingmoooon!
digimon,33rft2,ConfidentCoward,3,Fri Apr 24 23:02:42 2015 UTC,Stingmon! Best champion digimon! Except Angemon from season 1
digimon,33rft2,aqua_siege,3,Fri Apr 24 23:52:26 2015 UTC,"As a Kari and all Kari things maniac my favorite is of course Angewomon, cause she absolutely rocks. I know most thinks Angewomon is in Angemons level, but she is a higher level Angel. Angemon has 6 wings, while Angewomon has 8, same as MagnaAngemon. Seraphimon/Ophanimon have 10 wings, which in religion lower level angels have less wings.  From Adventures universe Patamon was like overpowered cause they needed to Hype his evolution, It took him only like 20 FRIGGIN EPISODES to evovle. Honestly I thought as a kid that the writers just forgot about T.K. 's crest and were like ""Oh shit we forgot the 7th crest. Well just put him to defeat the villain of the week. But we got only Piedmon. Oh well screw the rules, we have to sell MagnaAngemon toys. Let the ultimate defeat him for no reason at all. Great idea.""  From the 02 kids I love Imperialdramon Paladin mode which is in revenge of Diaboromon, just because he has a better pallet in my opinion and cause of Omni sword DUH! Then it's fighter mode next, and cool Stiiiingmooon! The other evolution were a bit more basic unfortunately but I still like Ex-Veemon with his V-Laser :P"
digimon,33rft2,william_bloody45,3,Sat Apr 25 00:33:45 2015 UTC,"Imperialdramon Dragon Mode. I'd honestly say all of Veemon's line is great, though I prefer the Veedramon line. He just seemed so badass and powerful. Paladin Mode is a very close second."
digimon,33rft2,Zelgan14,1 point,Sat Apr 25 06:42:56 2015 UTC,YES i always wanted a show with veedramon! Aeroveedramon was always one of my favorites design wise!

I just don't like it.  Choosing magnaangemon or angewoman feels like cheating, so I won't pick them.  Think I'll pick stingmon. It took cute little wormmon and made him pretty awesome."
digimon,33rft2,Wyietsayon,2,Fri Apr 24 22:51:27 2015 UTC,"Here is what it's supposed to be. But yeah it never grew on me either, and it still kind of doesn't make any sense."
digimon,33rft2,strawhatleon,2,Sat Apr 25 02:07:53 2015 UTC,"UGH! I remember when I was a child and was so excited that the day for pegasusmon's DNA digivolution would finally be aired arrived. Ran home, finished all my homework before the show started and ran to the TV. My siblings and I were super hyped bouncing off the walls, my mother even threatened to shut off the television if we didn't calm down.   Then finally, the moment came - no wait commercial break - the suspense was killing us. THEN FINALLY, the show came back, Pegasusmon and Anklyomon combined and when the light faded... we all held our mouths open in disbelief.   After a few moments of silence my younger brother finally said: ""He's a fuck'n teapot.""   We were so devastated that we finished watching the episode for the rest of the evening."
digimon,33rft2,nakednark,2,Tue Apr 28 00:54:10 2015 UTC,paildramon! this DNA-digivolution is just the best! although my favorite digimon of all the time is angemon
digimon,33rft2,TeaKey7,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:56:34 2015 UTC,Either ankylomon or his and angemons's fusion ( I forget what its called). I love pretty much all of armadillomon's digivolutions.

digimon,33qy48,jeffinitelyjeff,7,Fri Apr 24 19:58:18 2015 UTC,"Flamedramon, Raidramon, and Magnamon are all extremely cool Veemon Armor digivolutions and are all voiced by Steve Blum in the dub so all of their dialouge sounds amazing. Out of those three I would probably have to pick Flamdramon though in big part because of his moments in Hurricane Touchdown.  The fight scenes involving Flamedramon are all brilliant and he has some really Badass(yet cheesy) lines."
digimon,33qy48,VacantVagabond,7,Fri Apr 24 21:00:14 2015 UTC,"Steven Blum is like the Dan Green of Digimon. That is, voice acting Chuck Norris."

digimon,33qy48,Kyrmana,3,Sat Apr 25 01:17:30 2015 UTC,Shurimon is a straight up badass.
digimon,33qy48,ConfidentCoward,2,Fri Apr 24 23:02:08 2015 UTC,me after the episode he appears: USE SHURIMON! HE IS SO DAMN COOL
digimon,33qy48,EnkiiMuto,2,Sun Apr 26 21:35:49 2015 UTC,Raidramon! Then Pegasusmon.
digimon,33qy48,ravenclaw1991,2,Fri Apr 24 20:02:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Magnamon is an obvious choice for me but I feel like that's cheating so I guess Raidramon."
digimon,33qy48,aqua_siege,2,Fri Apr 24 22:37:02 2015 UTC,I really like Submarimon then Digmon. When they're all underwater inside of a digimon it was neat
digimon,33qy48,SubmittedToDigg,2,Fri Apr 24 23:54:45 2015 UTC,"I really love the Egypt-Cat-Sphynx thing they did with Gatomons Armor Evolution and I still don't understand the hate for it. It perfecrly goes with Kari's godly/martyr/alien as everyone calls her personality. (Egyptians Pharaoh's were considered Gods among men)  Also I can't get the hate for Patamons Armor Evolution. Patamon is a flying Hot dog pig thing. He is not human like, but angemon cause reasons. (same goes for gatomon) But the horse like armor was a more relatable to the routes of his phusique and appearance to the little flying cute Digimon.  Anyway, Nefertimon, then Flamedramon, Raidramon, Pegasusmon, Shurimon and then  Digmon is my list from more favorite to least."
digimon,33qy48,william_bloody45,1 point,Sat Apr 25 00:45:32 2015 UTC,"I actually like all the the digivolutions, except maybe Patamon's and Gatomon's I like gatomon's more, because of the Egypt princess/sphinx thing, but patamon is just sorta there because of Gatomon's.  I really like Shurimon. It took plant based, and made it something cool. A plant grass ninja with extendable vines. Pretty cool."

digimon,33nn9u,alibaba0304,6,Fri Apr 24 00:14:27 2015 UTC,What if there was a puzzle going around online that was impossible for anyone to solve but the digidestined?
digimon,33nn9u,Mattarias,5,Fri Apr 24 05:32:32 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on whether or not you want your digidestined to have been consciously/actively selected by the selecting force, or if you want it to be passive/coincidental/etc.  An example of the first would be some force or entity in the Digital World specifically searching for human children to save the world or whatever - as I recall, this is what Ophanimon did in Frontier with the mysterious text messages that brought a bunch of kids to the train stations, and eventually to the Digital World.  The second would be more like how most seasons' digidestined were chosen - the Adventure kids were basically just in the right place at the right time, for instance, although I can't recall right now if Koromon and Parrotmon getting sent to the human world was deliberate or not and the eight actually being called into the Digital World was deliberate on Gennai's part.  So...if your Big Good or whatever is actively trying to find digidestined, that should be relatively straightforward - a text, or an e-mail, or some online puzzle or test like what /u/Mattarias suggested. Or you could just have them being 'chosen' at random or semi-random, for no other reason than being in the right place at the right time to get sucked into the Digital World or something - maybe there's some kind of computer virus going around, and when it interacts with something in a specific way it opens up a portal. It really depends on what the rest of the story is like."
digimon,33nn9u,Fangren3000,2,Fri Apr 24 06:13:01 2015 UTC,"Wow I think this was literally the first time I've ever been mentioned in a post.... Neat! Thanks!  Anyways, yeah, I never 100% understood how Greymon vs. Parrotmon translated into ""these are the kids matched up with these eggs/crests"", but I really liked Ophanimon's way of doing things. Generally the Big Good directly doing stuff is my jam."
digimon,33nn9u,Mattarias,2,Fri Apr 24 07:37:50 2015 UTC,"What if they happened to come into contact with one of the children from the other seasons? Then, it would be easy to show why they were there"
digimon,33nn9u,aqua_siege,2,Fri Apr 24 02:59:22 2015 UTC,Don't get too fixed about the selection process. It's only a small part of the call to adventure and should be used as a tool to improve/explain your characters and therefore depends heavily on your characters and the rest of the story.  You can even leave this part out and go on without. The first season of Adventure didn't bother with the process of being chosen until episode 45.
digimon,33nn9u,SydMontague,2,Fri Apr 24 08:01:22 2015 UTC,I have always liked the fact that the first digidestined children witnessed the first battle and the second digidestined children witnessed the battle with Diaboromon online. But I can agree with the whole right place at the right time.
digimon,33nn9u,bat1939,1 point,Fri Apr 24 12:18:47 2015 UTC,"Maybe you could go in the opposite direction, instead of having them be in the right place at the right time make them know nothing about digimon. So the ""chosen"" ones will be chosen because there ignorant of the digital world. So then your exposition could explain a lot more of the world since the main characters know nothing about the world."

digimon,33n002,SuperMo83,5,Thu Apr 23 21:18:03 2015 UTC,"Aesthetically, the digi-egg of Love was my favorite. But in terms of concept, I actually was a big fan of the digi-egg of Miracles. It reminded me of old days with Tags and Crests, where they didn't work at will, but still there when you needed them.   When I was a kid, I imagined myself having the Crest of Miracles, which worked kind of like Hope where it wasn't so much the ability to produce miracles but rather the faith that things would work out. I imagined my role to be kind of like T.K.'s, where I wouldn't be the star player but I'd shine when it really mattered."
digimon,33n002,didroy,3,Thu Apr 23 23:07:30 2015 UTC,Looking at the Digi-Egg Best Design for  me was the Friendship one. It's pretty cool looking although it doesn't exactly resembles an egg and has those teeth painting it looks like a dinosaur it's going to come out of it!! Close second is Courage (even though my fav. for Partners and Characters was Gatomon-Kari)   So final verdict :Digi-Egg of FRIENDSHIP wins!!
digimon,33n002,william_bloody45,3,Thu Apr 23 23:37:47 2015 UTC,Courage! Everyone that knows me knows that I love fire.
digimon,33n002,Mattarias,1 point,Fri Apr 24 04:03:22 2015 UTC,"In terms of design alone, I'd say my favorite is Sincerity because it's the most symmetrical, next to Reliability. But all the Reliability evolutions looks stupid to me where I think all of the Sincerity ones look pretty cool in their own way.   That being said, I've always hated Hope. For what reason does it have Patamon ears on the top? Does that imply only Patamon can use it, or does everything that Armor-Digivolves with it is supposed to gain a tiny pair of Patamon ears?"
digimon,33n002,YaoiWowie,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:04:49 2015 UTC,"The other Digimon that can use it do not gain Patamon ears or even resemble the Digimental at all. But then, that's the case with most of them, not just the Hope evolutions."

digimon,33k1ln,hirmuolio,3,Fri Apr 24 02:37:06 2015 UTC,Degenerating and digivolving again makes digimons stronger (usually). When leveling gets too slow for you just degenerate/digivolve. This also makes some dna digivolutions a bit tricky to train as they don't always digivolve/degenrate normally.  All digimons in your party get full xp. I played through most of the game with only 3 digimons in my party before I realised this.

digimon,33k1ln,TheDarkFiddler,2,Fri Apr 24 02:37:56 2015 UTC,"Continuously Digivolve and degenerate Digimon. It's the most efficient way to increase stats after a certain level. If you care about having the strongest Digimon possible, there are also hidden resistances that can be built up for each type of attack by using the PC/farm. Any Digimon can become any other Digimon. Therefore any Digimon can have any move that is not a signature move. It's all a matter of finding the right Digivolution/degeneration path. I had over 300 hours in game of collecting and training Digimon. Obviously, like Pokemon, if you just want to get through the main story then you don't need to worry about too much of this."

digimon,33kiim,jimdoru,7,Thu Apr 23 08:52:17 2015 UTC,What is the main concept of Digimon?
digimon,33kiim,SydMontague,1 point,Thu Apr 23 09:18:19 2015 UTC,"A bunch of children going to the digital world, finding strange creatures, becoming friends with them, defeating the evil monster that is causing chaos, returning home like nothing happened??"
digimon,33kiim,kolopetinitsa,6,Thu Apr 23 11:14:15 2015 UTC,"Well, in my eyes the core concept of Digimon is the existance of a (digital) world within (or parallel to) the human world, which is inhabited by creatures that posses human like intelligence.  And the spirit of Digimon is to tell a story in which these 2 worlds collide somehow and how problems, that arise from that, will be overcome."
digimon,33kiim,SydMontague,-1,Thu Apr 23 11:55:33 2015 UTC,"Thing is having humans with no partner digimon is a way more radical change than what they should do .   To give u an example u can say that Michael Bays' Transformers  were a bunch of good transformers movies and follows the concept  but I would still argue the main point should not be to show how badass the american army is . It's the same with frontier ,   It should be about partners bonding , not just kids kicking ass !"
digimon,33kiim,jimdoru,2,Thu Apr 23 13:49:27 2015 UTC,"As I'm not finished with watching Frontier yet (Episode 26 currently) and haven't even started the later seasons, so I can't really judge about them. (Neither have I seen any Transformers movie)  I totally agree with you, that Digimon shouldn't be about fighting itself. However, I think partners bonding is just one thing Digimon should/can be about - there are so many more interesting topics that haven't been explored, yet. It should be allowed to experiment and innovate - the results might be not as good Adventure or Tamers, but repeating the same concept all the time gets boring, too."

digimon,33kiim,QuantumFury,9,Thu Apr 23 19:24:53 2015 UTC,"Tamers is Digimon that just was going to be canceled on late 2000s. It's atmosphere is eerie and creepy, things that could cartoons got away with in the 90s and early 2000s. And I am glad they did. The show is awesome.   Its story and characters are great, gritty and more realistic than the previous seasons. Also mostly feels like a sci-fi series than the fantasy ones of adventures. But believe me, its definetely worth finishing. If you havent watched it before you will absolutely feel for it as strong as for the adventure story in the end."
digimon,33kiim,william_bloody45,3,Thu Apr 23 09:40:24 2015 UTC,"Same. It's one of my favorite series because it doesn't shy from going even darker then the first two series and delving more into the psychology of the characters and their relationship with their digimon.   Personally, I feel it's the one of the last traditional Digimon partner series as we then go into completely different territory following this with Digimon Frontier where we have the characters not really having Digimon partners at all and being the Digimon themselves, then Savers created more of a Power Rangers/ police force theme which really didn't mesh well with me, and then Xros Wars just felt weird to me."
digimon,33kiim,disneywizard,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:24:24 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, did you watch Savers all the way through to the end?"
digimon,33kiim,KeytapTheProgrammer,1 point,Wed Apr 29 07:15:49 2015 UTC,"I tried, I really did but I got bored with it  around episode 20 or so halfway through the shoW during it's original run on Jetix when I was a kid, so when I was 13.   I DID, however, last year when I was recovering from my wisdom teeth surgery to watch the last few episodes - still didn't like it.  I guess the biggest reasons why I didn't like it was the completely different animation style, the departure from having kids my age in the show and being older teens who were actually working, and the music was terrible (I'm a musician and music lover - if the music isn't good in the show, it usually doesn't last long in my favor)."
digimon,33kiim,disneywizard,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:33:45 2015 UTC,"during it's original run on Jetix   Well there's your problem.  Honestly, I'm not usually a ""the sub is much better"" kind of guy, but in this case...  It is.  The problem is that the show was marketed towards an older audience in Japan, however Jetix, kid oriented group it is, dubbed it as such.  As a result, there is a fairly heavy descrepancy between what is being said and what is actually being portrayed.  I honestly feel like this is one of the biggest reasons that Savers (or Data Squad, if you prefer) was a flop in the states.  It's a shame, too, because there was actually talk for Adult Swim to pick it up for a while.  No idea what happened there, though.  Regarding the music though, I can't help you there.  I don't recall if Jetix changed the music or not, so I can't really comment about that.  But if it was kept the same, I personally enjoyed it.    In any event, if you haven't, I really strongly urge you to watch the subs.  If you watch it all the way through, I can almost guarantee you won't regret it."
digimon,33kiim,KeytapTheProgrammer,1 point,Thu Apr 30 09:12:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the recommendation.   I'll give that a try though it will be hard - usually whatever way I discover an anime first - either dub or sub - my brain will fixate on that and won't let me watch the other form. So if I watch an anime dub, it's hard for my brain to wrap itself around the sub version. Same with subs."
digimon,33kiim,disneywizard,5,Thu Apr 30 14:47:00 2015 UTC,"I felt like that too the first time I saw it, personally, it's my least favorite of the first 4 seasons, but the characters really grow on you, you just have to adjust to the differences between 02/Adventure and this season. It's been a while since I don't rewatch it, and around here seems to be pretty popular, so I think it's just the change of dynamic, you will enjoy it even more."
digimon,33kiim,AlotOfTime,4,Thu Apr 23 07:00:08 2015 UTC,"Every new series that isn't a direct sequel takes place in a different universe and has a vastly different feel. Adventure and 02 were more fantasy-oriented, Tamers was more urban science fiction. After that came Frontier, which not only shifted the focus back to fantasy but also payed homage to old-fashioned Tatsunoku anime heroes by replacing the Digimon partners with transformations. Savers blended some fantasy with urban sci-fi elements, and emphasized the heroes as part of a peacekeeping force rather than as children who happened to become heroes by circumstance. Finally, Xros Wars borrowed heavily from super robot anime in both style and presentation."
digimon,33kiim,Zennistrad,3,Thu Apr 23 11:22:27 2015 UTC,"What episode are you at and what language are you watching it in? (It's an important piece of context)  Tamers is meant to be different from Adventure to present us with new problems and to use other story telling mechanics. But trust me, Tamers plays in the same league as Adventure, quality wise."
digimon,33kiim,SydMontague,2,Thu Apr 23 09:07:15 2015 UTC,"It does feel way different, but I like both Adventures and Tamers. They both handle pretty deep issues, just in different ways. Tamers never feels as comfortable to watch as Adventure does, but I think it's supposed to be like that. I dunno. But keep on going. The start is slow, but the payoff is great. It probably won't end up as your favorite, but it's still great."
digimon,33kiim,Wyietsayon,2,Thu Apr 23 07:56:43 2015 UTC,"Tamers is a wonderful series that delves much more into the psychology of the characters than the previous two series, all while still delivering a clear and concise plot for most of its duration."
digimon,33kiim,wood_and_nails,2,Fri Apr 24 16:26:15 2015 UTC,"Yes it was meant to be different. Think of it as a completely different anime.

Yes, ive watched many animes like FMA, onepiece, shakugan no shana,code geass, angel beats, even the new ones like yahari, etc.I even watched digimon 1 ,2, and 4. Pokemon too.

digimon,33kiim,ahmadmanga,2,Mon Apr 27 17:28:18 2015 UTC,"If you think Tamers dosen't feel like Digimon then you should never watch Frontier; which is practically Power Rangers in the Digital World.

digimon,33iria,Wyietsayon,4,Thu Apr 23 21:20:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like everyone else, I usually pick gatomon, but the writers really didn't feel like doing anything with her.So I pick wormmon for his character development. Veemon's a slightly less annoying Davis, and Hawkmon and Armadillomon are sorta interesting, but again, had nothing to do with the plot aside from ""Cheer up respective digidestined partner, I want snacks from Yolei's store.""  Oh yeah, and Patamon was in this too. I forgot. I think he said something once?  In terms of visual design, I think they all are pretty good actually. Props on making Veemon not red, because every protagonist must be red for some reason, but this manages to avoid that pretty well."

digimon,33gtgv,Xgamer4,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:43:15 2015 UTC,That's true but creating such simulator requires a good amount of knowledge of how the mechanics work. And a ambitious fan who knows how to program such simulator.
digimon,33gtgv,scarecr0w141,2,Wed Apr 22 16:16:40 2015 UTC,Unfortunately one major oversight in the game's multiplayer completely kills this concept. Online you can only battle random people. The only requirement for such community to exist is to be able to meet someone in that community and challenge them to battle there however since Multiplayer with selected players is excluded to Ad-hoc only this completely kill the potential of such community.   I don't see that as a problem since Smogon started on 3rd Gen wherein everything was done local-coop. The community in this game will only grow if they are dedicated enough to do so. Of course you can argue that by today's standards online-play of this level is mediocre but this is what they got and frankly if the game could garner more support; the next iteration(if there will be) could improve upon these features. Although I'm hoping they'd at least localize it first :))
digimon,33gtgv,Thedovahkiin090105,1 point,Thu Apr 23 00:48:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Pokemon ruby and sapphire is 12 years old. Standards there were far lower than they are today. I'm pretty sure there will be a future iteration. The game sold very well and was well received. Outside of the low difficulty during the main story at least. That killed the game for some people. Not localizing this game would be stupid imo. The demand is ridiculously high outside of japan for this game.  I may have jumped too quickly to a conclusion saying that they blew the competitive potential."

digimon,33gtgv,swordmagic,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:52:40 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to add my input about the ""flaws"":  OP Strategy:  I haven't done online battles yet so there could be item restrictions Im not aware of but people can have 'anti-meta' set-ups. Have your digimon hold the items that negate specific debuffs like sleep or dot. Or include party members that prevent certain debuffs. Speed, in these type of games will always be a factor so using super OP spd digimon isn't really a flaw of the game, but of this specifc battle system. At least it shows the order of who will go next so you can 'plan' ahead.   As for making a community, they might patch in something similar to rooms or something that will help foster a community. I don't believe the DLC stuff is out for non-first print players yet so maybe online patches will be released with the DLC public release?"

digimon,33f6xv,pinkoctillery,3,Wed Apr 22 02:34:48 2015 UTC,I always thought it would have been much more logical for them to DNA digivolve than Ken and Davis.
digimon,33f6xv,Bomb_Tombadil,7,Wed Apr 22 13:00:08 2015 UTC,"Still as the best and more developed character in the 02s mash of misguided fanfiction extravaganza of a season is Ken. He is explored more than the other kids, he has mpre central plots revolved around he and he is a villain turned good story. Who couldn't agree on that.  But we still pick the favorite character so I am of course gonna pick Kari. Yea yeah I can see it will be an obvious stupid answer to most, but I always loved the selflesness jesus/martyr/ alien that was Kari. She and T.K. were the untouched gems that could have been one of the best season character developments ever. They would have had such amazing depth. Instead they felt like all the adventure kids (except Izzy cause He is awesome in 02), but even worse since they did absolutely nothing in almost every episode and were more like babysitters to the new kids. Oh dark ocean you filled us with light and hope for character development and then you drown it along with Dagomon.... But oh well we are used to being dissapointed by that... So final verdict Favorite character and by far less interesting and best by others standars Kari Kamiya"
digimon,33f6xv,william_bloody45,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:47:48 2015 UTC,I 110% agree with you. Kari is probably going to be my favorite character of anything ever.

digimon,33f6xv,Bobthejoe,3,Wed Apr 22 01:17:17 2015 UTC,"T.K. all day! I feel it's amazing to see how events from Season 1 shaped his character. He's developed the skills necessary to become an awesome Digidestined and, in my personal opinion, I felt like he should be the leader except Davis (I know the reason Davis was chosen, no need for negativity). I also felt more connected to him whenever he had to confront the forces of darkness on multiple occasions.  Everyone has their own inner struggles that need to be handled face to face and to see the embodiment of Hope take on his own is truly amazing."
digimon,33f6xv,Chipmunksr1,3,Wed Apr 22 05:51:01 2015 UTC,i like TK since he seems to be mature or at least reasonable for a middle school kid. i would expect kids to be more like Daivs

digimon,33f6xv,ConfidentCoward,2,Wed Apr 22 06:22:25 2015 UTC,Yolei! I love her design (more so in her real world clothes than her weird aviator outfit) and I liked that they chose a girl to be the nerdy character. I only wish they had expanded on that in more than just a few episodes.
digimon,33f6xv,VacantVagabond,2,Wed Apr 22 05:49:42 2015 UTC,"Davis. For sure. He gets a lot of hate in general for being annoying, but its always been easy to relate and root for him, especially seeing how he always seems ready to make new friends and to put his faith in them as seen with Ken and even Wills(doesnt really count? haha).  Plus he really shines in his back and forth between him and yoli and even with Veemon.  His moments in the finale are aslo extremely cool and while he might lack the development of Ken he still makes for an awesome Goggle head :)"
digimon,33f6xv,Wolfman666,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:37:21 2015 UTC,To be fair I think most of his hate comes from his god awful english voice actor. I don't mind the character otherwise.

digimon,33f6xv,Zennistrad,1 point,Wed Apr 22 05:15:38 2015 UTC,"Cody. His straight-man approach to the eccentricities of the other cast members (particularly Yolei and Davis) made for some interesting group dynamics, and his personal connection to Oikawa via his father was a very interesting development that was one of the few saving graces of Adventure 02's final episodes. He was also the only character who could believably regret having to kill an enemy Digimon due to both his very strict sense of traditional responsibility and his personal experience with death."
digimon,33f2ab,doinurmop,4,Wed Apr 22 00:19:00 2015 UTC,"Sub is better for Adventure, but the dub gets quite good near the end. 02 is a pretty mediocre series either way so I prefer the dub making it more interesting to watch. Tamers you could go either way but there's really not much wrong with the dub apart from the music being changed. It pretty much hits all the notes it needs to.  So IMO sub for Season 1, dub for the others. But if you watch dub for 02 and Tamers, might as well watch dub for Adventure. But if you watch sub for Adventure, nothing wrong with sub for the others. Ultimately how you watch Adventure should probably affect your choice."
digimon,33f2ab,SSJ5Gogetenks,2,Wed Apr 22 04:27:10 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I see. I'll definitely being watching Adventure in sub then, I honestly feel like I might still watch all the other seasons in subs, since I watched them dubbed as a kid, though if what you say is true, the dubs for all the other seasons not being bad and all, maybe I'll watch the dubs for the others then"

digimon,33fwtr,NexasXellerk,6,Wed Apr 22 04:49:10 2015 UTC,"Yes the changes are big. The dub removes some scenes, adds jokes where they aren't needed, changes the music, re does entire lines, and adds puns everywhere.  The biggest example of this, is in episode 4 I think it is, the Birdramon digivolution episode. In the original context, Piyomon was being annoying to Sora and Sora was getting a bit ticked. In the dub, that is completely removed."
digimon,33fwtr,Smallkittenfeet,3,Wed Apr 22 21:48:59 2015 UTC,let me explain this in one example  the relationship of sora and matt  in the adventure american dub: WHY THE HELL IS SORA WITH MATT! tai and sora had chemistry not these two. it make absolutely no sense to me what so ever.  in the adventure japan sub: oh look matt and sora are together it makes so much sense it does not require any explaining. they had so much chemistry.  another example i lied :p  in the adventure dub: no swearing and very childish dialog  in the adventure japan sub: some minor swearing (not uncommon is the subs of most animes) and a more in depth dialog. and it may be darker as a script but i have not watched the adventure sub in way to many years.   but the censorship and change in the story telling that comes with the new translation actually makes the 2  very different. i like subs better i just rather not have to read or learn a new language.
digimon,33fwtr,36baaa,3,Thu Apr 23 03:52:19 2015 UTC,What's a few raindrops between friends?
digimon,33fwtr,funkybutts,3,Thu Apr 23 22:41:03 2015 UTC,"Late to the party, but I did this recently. Saw digimon dub as a kid, and decided to rewatch it, but subbed this time. It's like a breath of fresh air and feels different from the show I watched a kid.  It's not just the voice actors, but the entire sound experience is different. The music is different and when they all digivolve, there's no nasally voice mumbling ""dig. dig. digimon."""
digimon,33fwtr,Romiress,6,Sun Apr 26 22:50:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's pretty massive.  There was a lot of dialog changes and things that were censored or cut out. Terms were changed to avoid offending anyone (digisoul in one of the later series, etc). The dub also has Tai as the main character (He's not as much of a focus in the Japanese, but shares it more evenly).   One of the more obvious (and painful) changes for me is Joe. In the sub, Joe is mature, responsible, and he's basically the 'adult' of the group (With all the stress that comes with it). In the dub, he's... well, a whiny coward. They basically completely changed his character, and he's much worse for it. When he tells people not to do things, he's supposed to be coming off as responsible and wanting to do the right thing, not saying it because he's afraid of doing it."
digimon,33fwtr,SSJ5Gogetenks,2,Wed Apr 22 04:57:05 2015 UTC,"Eh, not really. Joe is still the responsible one in the dub. Everyone depends on him and all the viewers understand why his is the Crest of Reliability. They go through this a lot. He's not cowardly necessarily, he's as you say, mature and wants to take things slowly. I suppose from a certain point of view you could see him as a coward, but he's more level-headed than anything.  The biggest character change (and the only really major one IMO) is Mimi. She doesn't really contribute much to the dub at all.  Also, Tai IS the main character lol. What are you on about, mate? Are you also going to tell me that Takato isn't the main character of Tamers?"
digimon,33fwtr,Romiress,5,Wed Apr 22 05:37:24 2015 UTC,"The dub literally starts with 'if you scare him, he'd probably wet his pants'.  Tai is the main character in both series, but the dub has several changes (making him the narrator, etc) that put him well in front of the other characters, as opposed to the sub where it's more equal."
digimon,33fwtr,SSJ5Gogetenks,0,Wed Apr 22 05:38:59 2015 UTC,"The dub starts with Tai's point of view on things. It's not a narrator being objective. Viewers will be able to make their own impressions of Joe and he's fairly clearly not a coward. The early episodes of the dub are pretty bad and for the most part should be disregarded because the dub is pretty good by the end. I feel like a lot of people watch Episodes 1-5 of the dub and just say ""yeah this sucks"" when you have to consider the whole package."
digimon,33fwtr,Romiress,0,Wed Apr 22 06:15:45 2015 UTC,"Ok, but besides americanizing it a bit to be more accessable and the slight character changes is it really worth watching the sub over the dub?"
digimon,33fwtr,CocoaBagelPuffs,2,Wed Apr 22 05:16:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly, what happened to Joe isn't really 'slight'.  Yes, the Sub is far better. There's no reason to watch the dub unless you're going to watch it just for nostalgia purposes."
digimon,33fwtr,notagumon,5,Wed Apr 22 05:23:55 2015 UTC,Which is still just fine to do. I understand there are these differences to make it more accessable to american kids and have that in the back of my mind while watching the dub. I've done quite a bit of looking around the internet and there's a decent amount that say either is fine but there's just a lot of sub-elitists that hate any kind of editing.
digimon,33fwtr,SydMontague,1 point,Wed Apr 22 05:32:57 2015 UTC,"The sub also has a way better soundtrack than the dub. There's no screeching noises from the digivolution scenes. Instead there's really nice music. I also like that they use Bolero in a lot of scenes when things go weird.   Since Japan is a lot more lenient with things like cursing and alcohol use in kids media, the translation is a lot less childish. The kids say damn and piss, which wouldn't fly for an American TV show for kids.   Just a warning, if you use Netflix, the subtitles change their translation a lot, which is a bit of a pain. The subs aren't consistent."

digimon,338vxt,NexasXellerk,5,Mon Apr 20 16:09:28 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend Digimon World for the PS1. It has some problems but it's a nice game. You should use a guide, though, as many aspects of the game are hard to learn/find if you don't know where they are. The game also runs fine on an emulator.  If you watched the anime in any other language than japanese I recommend you to watch it in japanese with subtitles again. Digimon got censored, changed and cutted in some localizations and even if you had the luck to watch a localization that kept itself close to the original, the voice acting is usually better in japanese making the show more enjoyable. (Also, localizations sometimes have translation errors...)"
digimon,338vxt,SydMontague,3,Mon Apr 20 16:44:07 2015 UTC,honestly I prefer the dub because it has to be the funniest dub of anything I've ever seen besides Ghost Stories. my fiance and I are on a binge watch of seasons 1-3 (just starting 2) and the dub is incredible.
digimon,338vxt,pinkoctillery,2,Mon Apr 20 17:30:57 2015 UTC,"The US dub of Digimon contains many major changes, making it a completly different experience compared to the original. Thus, in order to be able to decide which one is preferred as well as to be able to talk with people who watched the original, it is recommended to watch the original version as well.  And to express it kindly: I'm not too fond of the US dub. ;)"
digimon,338vxt,SydMontague,2,Mon Apr 20 18:53:34 2015 UTC,eh everyone has their preferences. i just went and looked for deleted scenes after watching it and it didn't really add much for me.  I just see the dub get hated on a lot here so I wanted to express an opposing opinion lol Digimon is probably my favorite dub of any anime.
digimon,338vxt,pinkoctillery,3,Mon Apr 20 20:36:26 2015 UTC,"The deleted scenes are the smallest changes in the dub. The music got exchanged completly and the dialogue got altered to add bad puns (and sterotypes), effectivly destroying the emotional effect of all core scenes I've seen so far as well as adding layer to the show I'd call harmfull for children (teaching sterotypes).   There is a reason the dub gets hated a lot. ;)"
digimon,338vxt,SydMontague,3,Mon Apr 20 21:11:24 2015 UTC,"hey, like I said, everyone has their preferences! dub or sub, Digimon is still awesome :)"
digimon,338vxt,pinkoctillery,1 point,Mon Apr 20 21:14:37 2015 UTC,"All the emotional scenes have the exact same effect in the dub, IMO. Except for Angemon vs Devimon, that was pretty horrible in the dub."

digimon,338vxt,pinkoctillery,3,Mon Apr 20 23:45:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah but Apocolymon was kind of a joke in the original too, so it's not a big deal.  ""I AM THE ULTIMATE EVIL, COMPLETE WITH HOT AND COLD RUNNING WATER."" is probably the worst way ever to introduce a final villain, rofl."

digimon,338vxt,SydMontague,2,Tue Apr 21 00:46:30 2015 UTC,"He had no foreshadowing, showed up out of nowhere, and was beaten like an episode later."
digimon,338vxt,SSJ5Gogetenks,2,Tue Apr 21 01:49:19 2015 UTC,"Thats almost impossible due to the changed music. Music is possibly the most important layer when it comes to the mediation of (sad) emotions in audiovisual content and the soundtrack of the US dub is in every aspect inferior to the original.  Let's take Wizardmon's death as example. US version: Wizardmon get's hit - no music change (continues generic battle music). Wizardmon hits the ground - a ""I'm home"" music sets in - and Hikari and Tailmon go to him and do the deathbed talk (content wise about equal to japanese). Wizardmon dies, Hikari asking ""are you okay?"" and the Digivice reacts. Hikari screaming got cutted in the US version and a few frames of Wizardmon got added out of nowhere. Also, Hikari's dialogue seems to avoid the fact that Wizardmon is dying and that Hikari is aware of that.  Meanwhile in japanese: Wizardmon get's hit - silence except for the echo of the impact and Wizardmon hitting the ground. Hikari and Tailmon go to Wizardmon - slow and melchonic piano music sets in - and do the deathbed talk . Wizardmon dies - silence again. Hikari starts to cry and scream and the Digivice reacts.  Sorry, there is no way that anyone, who has a basic understanding of how such art works, could claim that the english version of the scene did equal or better than the japanese one. I watched the scene in both languages like 20 times each now and while the english one doesn't create an reaction at all, it feels like my heart stops beating when Wizardmon is hit in the japanese one.   As I already stated numerous times before, there is nothing wrong with liking the english dub - it's nostalgia and everything - but from an objective standpoint (not that I claim my standpoint is entirely objective) the japanese version is better by multiple magnitudes  TL;DR: You can't beat Takanori Arisawa this easy."

I haven't watched all of them yet, but it was a pretty cool thing for them to do.  They even have several of the original voice actors. They're kind of rush jobs and the dialogue is sometimes wonky, but its better than nothing.  Most, if not all, of them are on YouTube.  The most recent movie isn't dubbed, but it wasn't out yet when Disney was doing this."

digimon,331pw0,jelloey,15,Sat Apr 18 18:36:22 2015 UTC,Yep Magnadramon
digimon,331pw0,Animal31,12,Sat Apr 18 18:38:00 2015 UTC,I think ophanimon is the true warp digivolution judging she turns into angewomon.
digimon,331pw0,jelloey,45,Sat Apr 18 18:45:06 2015 UTC,Ophanimon is Gatomon with Tail ring  Magnadramon is Gatomon without  I mentioned this in my gatomon digimon of the week
digimon,331pw0,monjoe,13,Sat Apr 18 21:30:45 2015 UTC,"Angewomon is the ultimate form of both Ophanimon and Magnadramon (just like Magnaangemon is the ultimate form of both Seraphimon and Goldramon) so that doesn't necessarily prove anything. This particular Gatomon has demonstrated that her mega form is Magnadramon.  BTW, very cool picture."
digimon,331pw0,Zelgan14,12,Sat Apr 18 19:03:29 2015 UTC,It has to do with Gatomon's tail ring apparently.
digimon,331pw0,jelloey,6,Sat Apr 18 19:05:05 2015 UTC,"But haven't we collectively decided that the hurricane touchdown movie isn't cannon? I'm fairly sure that's the only known instance of her digivolution to mega.  And hell, if Tri is handwaving away 02 than Ophanimon would be the much better option."
digimon,331pw0,Zelgan14,6,Sat Apr 18 20:28:32 2015 UTC,Why not canon?  I like Magnadramon... the digidestined need at least 1 dragon mega!
digimon,331pw0,EvChemical,3,Sat Apr 18 20:32:17 2015 UTC,"The golden digieggs for one. Davis should have already had it from the movie when he received it in the show. I'm trying to find a link with more info than that. Also, no actual mention or anything of Wallace or the egg of Destiny after that. The Wallace stuff in the Our War Game movie was just added in the dub to tie the movies together.

digimon,331pw0,Zelgan14,1 point,Sat Apr 18 20:43:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think the golden eggs are ""true"" eggs, and they're only one time use. It also ties into the crests of them; they only appear to those 'destined' to have them or when a 'miracle' is needed.   Similar to how Angemon and Angewomon had the power to induce Agumon and Gabumon to warp in Adventure."
digimon,331pw0,shuzumi,1 point,Sun Apr 19 10:07:31 2015 UTC,"While possible, it still doesn't explain Davis' surprise when he meets Magnamon after using the egg in the show. They all act as if they had never seen him before.  But, this ain't the thread to delve into this conversation much more."
digimon,331pw0,PetevonPete,4,Sun Apr 19 14:32:12 2015 UTC,"That is true, but I think that as Takeru (T.K) and Hikari (Kari) have had similar digivolutions throughout the two seasons in pegasusmon and nefertimon and angemon and angewomon they may make the megas similar but that is just a thought."

digimon,331pw0,Cr4shdown,0,Sat Apr 18 19:23:28 2015 UTC,"I would probably say that Magnadramon is 'more' canon than Ophanimon as Magnadramon appears in the 02 movie The Golden Digimentals whereas the only place that Ophanimon appears is in a couple of Digimon games.  That said, I think Ophanimon is by far the most logical, and aesthetically pleasing option for an evolution from Angewomon."

I think the fact that they constantly flip flop between Ophanimon and Holydramon, even after revealing Ophanimon means they consider both to be equally viable Final forms though. Maybe even as a nod to Ophani's first appearance in Frontier,  Tailmon can freely switch between the two?"

digimon,331pw0,likeagrapefruit,6,Sun Apr 19 16:19:24 2015 UTC,"Regarding Ofanimon/Holydramon (Ophanimon/Magnadramon):  Holydramon is used in the (non-canon) The Golden Digimentals, and Wonderswan game Brave Tamer. Worth noting is that Ofanimon first debuted via card in September 2001, whereas Brave Tamer was released in December of that same year, so the game was certainly in development before Ofanimon was shown to the world.  Since then, Ofanimon was used in Battle Spirit 1.5 and the PSP Adventure game. With the 15th Anniversary Digivice, though, we're back to Holydramon. I'd say that the two works here that are probably most indicative of the present day series canon would be the PSP game and the Digivice, and of course they give conflicting answers. I'm on team Ofanimon myself, but there really isn't a good, clear answer as to which of the two is ""more"" canon. Hopefully tri. does clear it up.  Of course all this really just means is that we should just accept what All-Star Rumble says and go with the obvious answer of Examon."

digimon,331pw0,strawhatleon,2,Sun Apr 19 16:12:11 2015 UTC,I'd prefer Magnadramon but it's a good pic.
digimon,331pw0,Animedingo,7,Sun Apr 19 16:17:40 2015 UTC,"As cool as this art is, I really don't like the idea that any digimon can go mega.   In the original Digimon, the Ultimate Level was supposed to be the end all be all of things, it was difficult to obtain but possible. Most of the enemies were Ultimate, and by the end of the first series there were maybe 10 total mega digimon all together.   But since Tamers, everyone and their dog started getting Mega forms, and this was especially present in the games. The Mega form became the standard, it was expected, it's no longer this legendary rank among digimon, and in order to make a new ""Top level"" power up, they introduced things like burst modes that were I guess stronger than mega.   I'm not trying to sound like the digimon equivalent of a genwunner, and I'm certainly not trying to demean Digimon Tamers in any way, it's a great series, but I can't help but think that ""Mega"" shouldn't be the standard, it should be exclusive to god like digimon, and occasional team characters achieving this, or at the very least, make it difficult to control or something.   When Digimon Adventure established they could go Mega, every big boss fight was just War Greymon and Metal Garurumon. The exception to this, is Magna Angemon, who I actually feel does an outstanding job of representing the power of an Ultimate Digimon.   Sorry for the rant, had to get it off my chest"
digimon,331pw0,strawhatleon,6,Sun Apr 19 00:28:19 2015 UTC,"Well actually mega forms were released before adventure even aired in the pendulum digivices, and it took a lot of work to get your digimon to that level. So they were planning on adding them from the start. Also I don't think you actually see how rare are megas in the shows. And in each show they require a different way of evolving to actually achieve. We had warp evolution in the first, which only 2 digimon could do. DNA digivolving in 02. Tamers required bio-merging, Frontier was the first to actually disregard levels almost completely. But you get my point, they were always rare (at least compared to the rest of the digimon in the digital world). The last part of your comment contradicts your statement though. Every boss fight was WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon, just like in 02 it was Imperialdramon and so on. This is exactly why we need more megas from the rest of the cast. So that the fights won't be repetitive and wouldn't require burst forms or things like that."
digimon,331pw0,Animedingo,-2,Sun Apr 19 04:37:46 2015 UTC,"More megas isnt the answer  Its like in dragon ball z, when goku went super saiyan, it was this incredible legend. Thats what megas were. Now everyones a super saiyan and its lost all importance.   Its the same thing with digimon. When everyone has this all powerful mega form, nobody does"
digimon,331pw0,strawhatleon,2,Sun Apr 19 05:04:55 2015 UTC,"But not everyone has it, that's what I've been saying."
digimon,331pw0,MIMBs,0,Sun Apr 19 05:07:30 2015 UTC,"But look at Savers, there's only 4 main characters but they all have mega forms, + burst modes to top that.   I'm not even going to touch the digivolution mess that is Fusion.   Like, Hypothetically, in Digimon Adventure Tri, if every character got an episode where they achieved Mega form, it would lose it's majesty. It would be exciting in the moment, but boring in the long run because after a while it would be expected.   The anime doesn't have as much an issue with this as the games do but the anime is what caused it. In any modern Digimon game, if you're not a Mega or higher, you can't progress to the end of the game because you're not strong enough."
digimon,331pw0,Animedingo,3,Sun Apr 19 05:51:46 2015 UTC,"But you see, 4 characters is still not everyone, that's my point. You have a world full of digimon that cannot by normal means achieve such feat as evolving to their mega forms. And Savers isn't exactly the peek of the franchise. I'm not gonna even go into fusion, that thing is a mess as far as evolution levels go. Though I kind of see your point, but let's face it: evolving to mega isn't anything new and it was to be expected a long time ago.  I disagree about the games though. Strength there is evaluated in stats, and digivolving usually means boosting your stats. And like you said it's end game. End game is supposed to be hard, otherwise it would be too lame, so of course you are expected to grind and become stronger, I mean it's a standard of jrpgs in general, not just digimon games. And frankly I would be really pissed off if I couldn't evolve to mega in them, because I think of it as a kind of reward for all of my grinding and getting to the end."
digimon,331pw0,MIMBs,1 point,Sun Apr 19 10:31:32 2015 UTC,"i see where's your opinion going to.. ""one was deemed valuable until it lost its scarcity""   but to defend from this line    When everyone has this all powerful mega form, nobody does    not all Digimons have mega form or proper digivolution line (unless they are partner/villain digimon) not all Mega digimons are equal in power, being on certain level does not dictate the amount of power a digimon has. Some mega digimon may be a fodder to another mega digimon. Other prime example would be Lucemon, a rookie level digimon that's on par with digimons 2 levels above."
digimon,331pw0,Matthas13,1 point,Sun Apr 19 06:15:08 2015 UTC,"Yes my statement does not quite fit the theme I was going for, but you did see my point.   When everyone is a mega, the awe and strength that comes from being a mega becomes less special.   Like I said, if most of the megas were god like Digimon, like Lucemon or azulongmon, that would be fine, but it's gotten to the point where it's an expectation to reach the mega level. With over 2000 something digimon, possibly 3000, there are just way too many mega digimon"
digimon,331pw0,KngHrts2,1 point,Sun Apr 19 06:23:35 2015 UTC,"if most of the megas were god like Digimon, like Lucemon or azulongmon, that would be fine   i must say, i kind of agree with this one to the point where those extremely powerful God-Like Digimon should have their own level, because putting them along with fodder and average Mega level is quite an understatement. but that's another story..   Fresh : 36 | In Training : 43 | Rookie : 153 | Champion : 286 | Ultimate : 222 | Mega : 258 | Armor : 73 | Hybrid : 40 | plus a few other Level-less Digimon from Digimon Fusion (uugghh i will forever hate the concept of Digimon without level)  from information i got from digimon.wikia above, clearly we got lots of Mega digimon, but quite a lot of them are God-like Hero/Villain Digimon that only has Mega form."
digimon,331pw0,UnlimitedFlour,1 point,Sun Apr 19 06:51:33 2015 UTC,"Yea it kinda does, when in adventure we've seen warp digivolution we know shit just got real, when in other season well they just needed more power. Im not against giving others mega level however before that they should clearly make episodes where original digidestined digimons show how stronger they are than other digimons their type. For example Agumon showing he's literally unbeatable by multiple others agumons due to his experience and can even beat champion level digimons.  Of course who am I kidding, there we'll be new digivolution as for other kids as for Tai and Matt because marketing."
digimon,331pw0,raikaria,2,Sun Apr 19 08:58:03 2015 UTC,Wasn't Gomamon originally meant to digivolve into Plesiomon? They have the same coloring and orange hair... The only connection to Vikemon is the lore that he oversees the Zudomon corps
digimon,331pw0,KngHrts2,3,Sat Apr 18 20:48:29 2015 UTC,"I think it's like Ophanimon and Magnadramon for Gatomon. Gomamon can turn into either where the situation dictates, so Plesiomon in Battle Royale and Vikemon in Adventure PSP. I imagine Adventure Tri will probably set the law on Joe's Gomamon's Mega."
digimon,331pw0,biggest_dreamer,3,Sun Apr 19 00:37:53 2015 UTC,"Vikemon didn't exist until 02. So before then Plesiomon was Gomamon's Mega. Vikemon's actually Armodillomon's Mega. Which makes about as much sense as the Teapot.  Honestly it depends. If it's a direct evolution from Zudomon I'd rather Vikemon, but if it's a Warp Evolution from Gomamon, I'd rather Plesiomon."
digimon,331pw0,PetevonPete,1 point,Sat Apr 25 21:47:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't like Shakkoumon as Armadillomon's Mega...  I prefer a line that goes:   Armadillomon > Ankylomon > Brachiomon > Cannondramon"
digimon,331pw0,Harpoon_Torpedo,3,Sun Apr 26 17:53:52 2015 UTC,"Plesiomon more closely resembles Gomamon, Vikemon more closely resembles Zudomon. Either one works. The main reason Plesiomon is as associated with Gomamon as it is is because it existed before Vikemon, and the only other plausible Ultimate form for Gomamon at the time was MarineAngemon."
digimon,331pw0,PetevonPete,1 point,Sun Apr 19 16:33:57 2015 UTC,"We should count ourselves lucky we saw even the 2 seconds of Patamon's mega form since we didn't even see his ultimate form until, what the second to last episode?  And that whole arc wasn't even originally planned, so he never would have gotten off his lazy ass and digivolved."

But that is due to it being free to play.   Basicly you create a toon and your starter digimon (I always go agumon) then you learn the basics and you are off questing and raising different digimon. to get more digimon you have to find eggs as drops from enemies and then hatch them using data.  Thats all i will go into for now so it doesnt get too confusing :)   The game is pretty simple so if you download and sign up you should be fine. If you have any questions once you are in just let me know and i will answer to the best of my knowledge."

digimon,32x5xa,Mausar,22,Fri Apr 17 13:32:07 2015 UTC,"A lot of random speculation below from someone who is way too invested in this franchise.  Also I want to preface that while I spell out what I want the evolution paths to be based on what I've always considered them to be, I don't hesitate for a second to think that the team hasn't come up with brand new Digimon for the as-of-yet unconfirmed evolutions.  Hurricane Touchdown! of course isn't totally canon to the series, but in theory, Patamon and Tailmon (Gatomon) are able to evolve to their final stages.  At least, we have confirmation that Tailmon's would be Holydramon (Magnadramon) (as opposed to Ofanimon from Frontier, though I wouldn't hate it if they used her to parallel Takeru's Seraphimon).  I would imagine the others will reach their Mega stage, but like with all seasons, we will see some new type of evolution as a primary focus.  In fact, because they are already so advanced, I wonder how the series will progress.  With previous seasons, we saw them learn to evolve through each phase... we already have that here.  I wonder if they will introduce a new mechanic, or bring back armor evolution for the originals that didn't.  I wonder if Patamon and Tailmon will even still be able to armor evolve at all.  Also I wonder if the original chosen children's Digivices will be updated to match Takeru's and Hikari's, or if theirs will all change.  My fear is that while they say 02 is still canon that they will focus so much on the Adventure lore that some things in 02 might be retconned or overlooked.  For example, I like that Palmon is holding Mimi's hat in the new poster since Adventure ended with Mimi's hat floating off into the Digital World... but in 02 Mimi and Palmon meet several times, and Palmon never returns the hat or mentions having it.  It's been established since Adventure (courtesy of the card game(s) and video games) that the Ultimate (Mega) forms would be:   Koushirou and Tentomon - Heracle Kabuterimon Jou and Gomamon - Vikemon (As opposed to Marine Angemon, which although was the original before Vikemon was introduced in 02's era, doesn't make as much since coming from Zudomon; additionally we already used him in Tamers and within the context of Adventure, it would be too confusing to have someone else with an ""Angemon"" family Digimon) Mimi and Palmon - Rosemon, although because we used her in Savers for Lalamon's evolution, I would like to see Lotusmon, the ""original"" form of Natsumi's Bio Lotusmon Sora and Piyomon - Hououmon (Phoenixmon) is basically the choice but Crossmon (Eaglemon) is a less desirable alternative.   However, again, because these are so well-known and ""expected,"" they may have come up with new ones for them.  Like /u/kolopetinitsa said, I would expect maybe Jou and Koushirou to become Jogress (DNA) partners, and Sora and Mimi.  For Takeru and Hikari, they have Jogress partners already.  Though I doubt we will have many cameos with Daisuke, Ken, Miyako, and Iori, if they came back, I wouldn't mind getting the Ultimate forms of their Jogress evolutions.   Silphymon -> Valkyrimon Shakkoumon -> Goddramon   Hell, I wouldn't mind a very short episode arc where we see their Digimon's natural Perfect evolutions, like   XV-mon to Aero V-dramon and Ulforce V-dramon Stingmon to Jewel Beemon and Banchou Stingmon Aquilamon to... Hippogriffomon?  And then Griffomon?  Though that might be a better path for Holsmon. Ankylomon also has the problem of not having a well-defined solo path.  My best guess would be Bracchiomon to Cannondramon or Triceramon to Dinorexmon   I'm also really curious at what the Big Bad will be this season.  I would be disappointed if we returned to yet another Vamdemon form.  We got some of the Olympic XII in Savers and Xros Wars (though I haven't seen the latter), and the Seven Great Demon Lords was in Savers (and Lucemon in Frontier).  The Royal Knights were in Savers and in X-Evolution.  REGARDLESS it's going to be awesome and I can't wait to see what they actually choose to do and what new Digimon, if any, we will get to see the chosen children team up with!"
digimon,32x5xa,josephdean21,3,Fri Apr 17 15:40:42 2015 UTC,"One thing, in the game All star rumble, Gomamon doesn't go into Vikemon, he goes to  Plesiomon. While I wouldn't take that game for canon, it is odd how they make him go to that when the other lines seem natural.  Just a thought."
digimon,32x5xa,Smallkittenfeet,5,Fri Apr 17 17:16:16 2015 UTC,"Well, Digimon evolution paths are many and varied. Vikemon, Plesiomon, MarinAngemon, and many others (among them AncientMegatheriumon, Dukemon X-Antibody, MetalGarurumon, Neptunemon, SaberLeomon, and Seraphimon) are all possible paths for Gomamon. Vikemon is the most probable canon evolution for the Adventure Gomamon judging by the PSP game (for that matter, is there any indication that the Gomamon in All-Star Rumble is the Adventure Gomamon, or is it just a random other Gomamon?)."
digimon,32x5xa,likeagrapefruit,3,Fri Apr 17 18:23:22 2015 UTC,We cant also forget only because they are(Wargreymon/Metalgarurumon) at Ultime/mega level they can digivolve again like Wargreymon -> VictoryGreymon. It was shown in other season that between ultimate and ultra level there can still be digivolutions which increase power and yet digimon remains at ultimate level.  However over new digivolutions I would like more to see beginning of life with digimons like more and more ppl have their own digimon and we will see some kids in school with they own digimons. So instead of giving new digivolution they could show other kids brag about their strong digimons (which would be like adult level at max) at then our digidestined enter the stage with ultimate level.
digimon,32x5xa,Matthas13,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:29:41 2015 UTC,"The game was made by the same people who made the PSP game. Also there are many hints in the text when you play as him or encounter another digimon.  He tells the adventure/adventure 02 digimon ""long time no see"" or asks what they have been up to, along those lines, where as he doesn't know Guilmon, Shoutmon, Impmon or Dorulumon. If you want to take that as if he is the same one or not."
digimon,32x5xa,Smallkittenfeet,2,Fri Apr 17 22:45:52 2015 UTC,Oh that's interesting! I always pegged Plesiomon to be Marine Devimon's evolution. It would be pretty awesome though! Especially if they wanted to stay more along the actual in the water Digimon line for Gomamon.
digimon,32x5xa,josephdean21,2,Fri Apr 17 17:23:45 2015 UTC,"Plesiomon is much more fitting in comparison to Gomamon. He is an older canon game as Joe's Mega partner. Replaced by Vikemon, though. I'd like to see Vikemon as an alternate Jogress between Gomamon and Shakkoumon, somehow or another.  Because that is what Vikemon appears as. White Zudomon/Viking Gomamon wearing Shakkoumon armor"
digimon,32x5xa,huzaifa96,2,Fri Apr 17 20:00:01 2015 UTC,"That's actually a thing in the Japanese D3, it seems. While you can Jogress with another person who has your Digimon's opposite Adult, you can actually pair up to one of the Wonderswan games that has one of the Adventure kids' partners to go to the Final stage.   Paildramon + MetalGreymon Dinobeemon + AtlurKabuterimon Silphymon + Garudamon Angewomon + Lilimon Shakkoumon + Zudomon HolyAngemon + WereGarurumon   ...until I learned that, I always wondered why Lilimon was needed to make Holydramon with Angewomon in the Story games. I guess it was a reference to the D3?"

If they do give the others their mega forms, I'm hoping for Angewomon to digivolve into Ophanimon so that she is a better counterpart for Seraphimon. I'm also more of a fan of Vikemon as opposed to Plesiomon. I didn't even know Lotusmon existed!   After reading what you've said about the 02 Digimon's potential forms, I don't even know what to think. I just hope they include the 02 kids in some capacity because I'd love to see what they plan for all of them."

digimon,32x5xa,likeagrapefruit,2,Fri Apr 17 21:54:19 2015 UTC,"Or it's likely they design new ones. Or, rather, they go another completely different route and use new digivolutions for all stages beyond child.

This will make the series longer as all the eight digimon will have a final form. I hope this happens as it opens more variety for enemies and for the enemies to be even stronger as well."
digimon,32x5xa,Amla10,5,Fri Apr 17 18:41:05 2015 UTC,"My guess is that they will make similar evolutions to Omnimon.

I just purchased a wargreymon card on ebay recently that went for $80 but it also was a taco bell promotional item. most of what you have probably came from starter/booster packs and are going to be very common.   you could sell them as a lot or research to find the more valuable ones. having to go through 235 cards doesn't sound fun when there is probably little info on their value  maybe somebody else here knows better  GL

The creators of Digimon know It's not as popular in America anymore, so why not create a season for the fans of the original series?  I've tried getting into seasons after Frontier, but my mind does this thing where it doesn't consider anything after that to be official canon. Plus with voice changes, It's really hard for me to get into the show, so I kind of dropped Digimon altogether, even though I'm a huge fan of the series.  There are so many shows and movies and games out there, that try really hard to be relevant once again. It's an extremely difficult thing to accomplish, but Digimon is so simple, yet so unique, that I think it has a chance. I just hope they go all out with this season, and really give us something memorable. I want to see the other 6 Digimon turn into their mega forms. I want to really get the sense that these handful of kids are the only thing preventing both worlds from being completely overrun by monsters."
digimon,32td58,notagumon,6,Thu Apr 16 23:55:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I couldn't agree more. I stopped watching after Frontier, all the newer series make me cringe. I always thought it was just me growing up, but I can still watch the old stuff over a decade later no problem. Puns and all.  I'm really glad that they seem to be refocusing. I enjoyed 02 as well, but if they just kinda handwave it away, or only mention that stuff in passing I will be alright."
digimon,32td58,Zelgan14,10,Fri Apr 17 02:23:23 2015 UTC,"Or the pilot, both being directed by Hosoda. I really, really hope Tri is similar to those."

digimon,32td58,Electric27,1 point,Fri Apr 17 04:09:00 2015 UTC,No problem! :) it's one of my favorites ❤️
digimon,32td58,emichux3,2,Fri Apr 17 05:07:13 2015 UTC,"First season, right after the Etamon arc."
digimon,32td58,Beidah,3,Fri Apr 17 04:35:11 2015 UTC,"I rewatched this episode countless times and this is truly Hosodas masterpiece. It feels much more like Adventure (Movie) or Bokura no Wargame (Movie) than it feels like the TV show. The atmosphere is great and it when taichi realizes it's still August 1st, 1999, I always get goosebumps. However what makes this episode my favorite BY FAR is the A+ cinematography. Holy shit, this should not be in a children's TV show.   http://i.imgur.com/zvSOCyy.png http://i.imgur.com/6pOVhr5.png http://i.imgur.com/t9HjVZz.png"
digimon,32td58,TonyKaku,4,Sat Apr 18 02:47:53 2015 UTC,"I feel like if I hope for it to be as good as Season 1 I'm setting myself up to be disappointed.  I'm setting the bar at Tamers. If it's as good as Tamers, I'll be happy."
digimon,32td58,PetevonPete,6,Fri Apr 17 03:24:20 2015 UTC,"Wait, you liked the Adventure more than Tamers? I can see the nostalgia reason but I thought Tamers was definitely a better told story from a writing perspective."
digimon,32td58,noxnsol,4,Fri Apr 17 11:12:06 2015 UTC,"Well Tamers also has nostalgia for me so I don't think that's the reason.  Tamers made a really bad first impression with me with their clumsy attempt to reboot the universe, and I never liked the characters as much."
digimon,32td58,PetevonPete,2,Fri Apr 17 15:12:46 2015 UTC,Same here. Adventure is my clear-cut favourite because of the characters.
digimon,32td58,opelaceles,7,Fri Apr 17 20:26:33 2015 UTC,Well can't be as bad as Xros was.
digimon,32td58,Xereeth,1 point,Fri Apr 17 07:06:46 2015 UTC,My favourite episode.
digimon,32td58,opelaceles,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:25:46 2015 UTC,"If Tri is even three percent as good as the depicted part in the series, I'd be happy. The animation, story and lasting effect on the plot made that episode one of the, if not the, best."
digimon,32w3h1,samsg1,12,Fri Apr 17 04:53:04 2015 UTC,The last arc is only 14 episodes I believe. It's pretty short all things considered. Things pick up once they start dealing with Puppetmon and the in fighting starts happening.
digimon,32w3h1,crewnh,7,Fri Apr 17 05:16:14 2015 UTC,"Definitly yes. The dark masters arc might start a bit slow, but once you got past MetalSeadramon you get some of the best episodes of the season.  Also, if you ever find yourself struggeling with ""mon-of the week"" episodes, try to understand why they exist. Because none of them is a filler.  And out of curiosity: what language are you watching it in?"
digimon,32w3h1,SydMontague,2,Fri Apr 17 08:41:05 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'll push through, thank you! I'm watching in Japanese. I live in Japan so I have no excuse! The repetitive music does irritate me though.."
digimon,32w3h1,KJCollins,2,Sat Apr 18 01:43:34 2015 UTC,Yea but the musics repetitive in all the dubs. You can't escape it.
digimon,32w3h1,BTrumbl,1 point,Sat Apr 18 10:09:47 2015 UTC,"It is irritating, but when you finish the series and listen to the songs again, you get Pavlov'ed and start feeling feels."
digimon,32w3h1,Masterofknees,6,Sun Apr 19 21:28:07 2015 UTC,"I think Scorpiomon is one of the last 'mon-of-the-week like you put it, there might be one in Puppetmon's forest but I can't quite remember, the rest of the Dark Masters arc flows pretty naturally, personally it turns out to be my own favorite arc. Besides, you're not far from the end, so it'd be a bit silly to give up now."
digimon,32w3h1,aqua_siege,3,Fri Apr 17 06:55:23 2015 UTC,The Dark masters arc is definitely my favorite! Don't give up on the show. Definitely worth finishing.
digimon,32skmo,thecomposer42,30,Thu Apr 16 11:15:57 2015 UTC,All the hate for 02 makes me sad. I hope Tri takes care of the plot holes this time around.
digimon,32skmo,m1nty,15,Thu Apr 16 11:25:50 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I just love 02 for the characters and awesome Digivolutions :/ I would love for those to come back, disregarding (or changing) the errors with the season."
digimon,32skmo,epicaz,11,Thu Apr 16 17:33:30 2015 UTC,"I fully agree. I think that Takeru/TK from 02 is my favorite of the Digidestined, and all of the branching digivolutions with the armor eggs is definitely a breath of fresh air."
digimon,32skmo,waaarg,5,Thu Apr 16 19:43:53 2015 UTC,I need more Takeru smacking bitches down.
digimon,32skmo,ThatAwesomePenguin,5,Fri Apr 17 09:03:56 2015 UTC,It would be hard but manageable. The Writers had more than enough time to thing about ways to explain everything.
digimon,32skmo,TheGamer821,14,Thu Apr 16 11:37:24 2015 UTC,"From all I've seen so far for Tri works best when you say ""02 never happend"". 02 is not THAT bad (well the epilogue was beyond bad - it was one of the worst things I've seen in my life - and I've seen Digimon World 2), but it has massive plot holes (and plot conflicts with season 1) and failed to use what season 1 created."
digimon,32skmo,SydMontague,14,Thu Apr 16 12:52:32 2015 UTC,I didn't really find the epilogue too bad. Why does everyone hate it? The only thing I found really stupid was Yamato becoming an astronaut. That pretty much came out of nowhere.
digimon,32skmo,BTrumbl,2,Thu Apr 16 14:02:18 2015 UTC,"I hate it because it's one of those 0815 ""everything is great now"" happy endings. It neither added something to the story nor to my life. It left me empty behind, as it answered every question, solved every mystery and was free from any emotion. It closed the book - forever and without necessarity. Also, after 25 years I couldn't care less about the characters - they're not the ones anymore I just spent 50 episodes with (nor do I get the feeling they are). -> I can't relate myself with them anymore and have no reason to think about (and therefore remember) the show.  If you compare it with endings like in season one or Tamers (or if you require a non-Digimon example, movies like Interstellar or Inception) you see that it doesn't stand a chance against them."
digimon,32skmo,SydMontague,5,Thu Apr 16 15:08:55 2015 UTC,"I think it's because they treated the end of 02 like the definite finale, without cause for continuation. I actually quite liked seeing where everyone ended up, but kinda hated how some of the careers for the characters didn't quite make sense - Sora being a fashion designer and Yamato being an astronaut.   But I do suppose that the series could have done without it, leaving the future to be up to the imagination of the fans.    they're not the ones anymore I just spent 50 episodes with (nor do I get the feeling they are)   Why do you think this? Most of the futures of the children fit their personalities (besides the ones I've mentioned), and I don't see any reason why they wouldn't be.   If you compare it with endings like in season one or Tamers (or if you require a non-Digimon example, movies like Interstellar or Inception) you see that it doesn't stand a chance against them.   Note that I haven't watched Tamers yet, but for the other things you mentioned, it looks like your definition of a good ending is an open ending.   For me personally, I don't mind an ending that ties up loose ends, as long as they do so in a logical manner. Take the end of Gurren Lagann, for example, where all loose ends are tied up in a similar manner (characters are grown up). I can't go into more depth since I don't know how to spoiler tag in this sub.   It neither added something to the story nor to my life.   However, I can fully agree with this one, which is why I don't really mind the ending. It's not that bad, nor does it really add much."
digimon,32skmo,BTrumbl,5,Thu Apr 16 17:53:22 2015 UTC,"Why do you think this? Most of the futures of the children fit their personalities (besides the ones I've mentioned), and I don't see any reason why they wouldn't be.   Well the weird careers are one reason, the disconnect with world itself (everyone got a Digimon) might be another one. It just doesn't feel right. It just can't get myself to really see them as the characters they were 25 years ago. (After all, 25 years are a long time) But maybe it's because the ending takes the fantastic out of the world by being so normal.   Note that I haven't watched Tamers yet, but for the other things you mentioned, it looks like your definition of a good ending is an open ending.

I can't go into more depth since I don't know how to spoiler tag in this sub.   I haven't seen Gurren Lagann. ;)  An ending has to reflect the piece of art it is made for. It is the last thing you see and the first thing your remember, so you do well when your ending ties up loose ends and ""finishes"" the story. But to be remembered it has to mean something to you. To feel with the characters, to release you with an revelation or to simply make you think about what you just saw. Therefore, I really value good endings.  It doesn't matter whether an ending is open or closed for such things, but I guess open ones are more common in the industry as they allows sequels, which are usually safe investments - which isn't always a good thing.  A thing I've learned is, that only one things can happen to a story worse than an ending: that it gets no ending at all."
digimon,32skmo,SydMontague,6,Thu Apr 16 19:17:49 2015 UTC,"An ending has to reflect the piece of art it is made for.   From my viewpoint, the part where they all save the Digiworld was kind of the true ending, and the epilogue was just that - an epilogue that tied up loose ends. It was not where the emotional release lies, but rather a way to wrap up the story. In a way, it did reflect the message that the series was trying to get at - if you keep believing in yourself and your friends, nothing is impossible and you will achieve your dreams, hence the careers and future shenanigans. Nothing shows this more than the coexistence of digimon with the people from the real world, and the way the characters had lived fulfillling lives. After all, those where the goals the CC aspired to.  I do understand where you're coming from though, and since it was basically a huge exposition dump, we didn't really get to feel the characters' growth or emotions so much."
digimon,32skmo,BTrumbl,2,Thu Apr 16 19:31:08 2015 UTC,As someone who keeps hearing about this but actually doesn't know... can you tell me what the plot holes are and the such?
digimon,32skmo,mfender7,12,Thu Apr 16 13:51:15 2015 UTC,"The ones I can recall from my head: - the whole Dagomon/Cthulhu arc, which was introduced in Episode 13 but actually never happend. - the crests were created for the original team, so where does the crest of kindness come from? - suddenly everyone is a ""chosen children"" (DigiDestined), regardless of the term ""chosen"". After all this should mean you have a quest to do for the digital world, yet it only seems to mean ""you get a pet"" for most of them - 02 explains the digital world (and all other worlds) with a multiverse theory (all worlds exist parallel besides each other), season one explains it with a shadow world theory (the digital world exists within the human world).    The last one is the most massive one, as the explaination is contradictory to the one from season one."
digimon,32skmo,SydMontague,8,Thu Apr 16 16:03:37 2015 UTC,"the whole Dagomon/Cthulhu arc, which was introduced in Episode 13 but actually never happend.   The Dagomon part was never really followed up, which was pretty frustrating, but overall, wasn't so bad in the long run, since they did reference the events in 13 and use (and explain, albeit briefly) the concept of the Dark Ocean.   the crests were created for the original team, so where does the crest of kindness come from?   Agreed. This was pretty bs.    suddenly everyone is a ""chosen children"" (DigiDestined), regardless of the term ""chosen"". After all this should mean you have a quest to do for the digital world, yet it only seems to mean ""you get a pet"" for most of them   This really bugged me. It completely belittled the significance of the original Chosen Children, since in 01, they specifically said that the CC had special qualities that made them able to fight the darkness in the DigiWorld. However, I did like the idea of people and Digimon coexisting (as in the epilogue, where each person had a Digimon partner), since it felt like the start of a new era, where both the worlds can live in peace.   02 explains the digital world (and all other worlds) with a multiverse theory (all worlds exist parallel besides each other), season one explains it with a shadow world theory (the digital world exists within the human world).   I believe it was only a theory in 01 that the Digiworld existed within the human world. Although I do recall Koushiro in 02 talking about how he had a theory on what the Digiworld actually was in 01. But that's the thing - it was just a theory back then, and not an actual explanation for the Digiworld. I could be wrong, though - I may have forgotten some details."

The idea of humans and Digimon coexisting is one I personally really like, but not the way they did it in the epilogue (and even in the show itself). Digimon are no pets or somewhat lifeforms that need to have a human partner and are certainly nothing that can be possesed by a human. They should have an equal standing in the society like humans - after all they're intelligent beings.  Or to quote The Talos Principle: ""Frogs are people, too!""  (Yes, I'm an idealist in this matter.)   I believe it was only a theory in 01 that the Digiworld existed within the human world.

Gennai actually confirmed Koushiro's theory in season one already , even though Koushiro claims that he's been wrong in 02. Another thing about the multiverse theory is, that it would require that the digital world is made out of nothing from the human world - what would mean that it isn't digital in any way. ;)"

I would think that it's not such a stretch to say that this could also spawn a multiverse, worlds created in a similar manner to how the Dark Ocean world was supposedly formed from negative emotions."
digimon,32skmo,BTrumbl,2,Thu Apr 16 20:30:52 2015 UTC,"the finale in general was just full of plot holes. i hated the final conflict resolution more than the epilogue. its a shame because i still consider Ken to be one of my fav characters from digimon and 02 still has its strong points, such as its stronger opening to the first season.

digimon,32shag,jelloey,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:19:14 2015 UTC,Very cool. It may interest you to know that the original name of Joe's crest of reliability on the Japanese anime was the crest of faith. They changed it because they didn't want religion in the show.
digimon,32shag,likeagrapefruit,3,Thu Apr 16 16:01:18 2015 UTC,"Actually, it was the crest of 誠実, which has been alternately translated as faith, sincerity, or honesty. ""Reliability"" does capture the meaning of the term. I doubt religion had anything to do with the name being censored considering how many Digimon there are that are based on things from different religions."
digimon,32shag,jelloey,2,Thu Apr 16 18:59:54 2015 UTC,"Well the crest is a cross, and he does use a religious chant to defeat the Bakemon (which was also removed from the dub)"
digimon,32shag,NowaSowa,1 point,Fri Apr 17 01:00:36 2015 UTC,I guess it's coupled with the fact that his crest was essentially a cross.
digimon,32shag,spiderman616,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:45:25 2015 UTC,"That's true. If you think about it, the traditional embodiment of faith in the Japanese culture encapsulates all of the various translations of ""faith"" in English. But that's not how America views it. Japan is more orthoprax where America is more orthodox."
digimon,32shag,compoundgc161,2,Fri Apr 17 05:12:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I found that out in college when I rewatched the series subbed. Still, I think reliability was a better translation into English and revealed more of his character"

digimon,32tkye,jimwhat,1 point,Sat May 2 12:52:27 2015 UTC,You can get a vpn to bypass the ip blocking. Do you have a link for the middle-man service? Or is it something you need to do one-on-one with a korean guy?
digimon,32tkye,hoilori,2,Sat May 2 13:12:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the extra lag from the VPN can be a deciding factor in PVP.  It's a one-on-one. I'll PM you his email and you can check if he's still doing it."

digimon,32nqf5,dotyawning,4,Wed Apr 15 12:37:23 2015 UTC,It's a story about the original kids. They're probably skipping 02 because most of the original kids played bit parts there.
digimon,32nqf5,butterfly1763,2,Wed Apr 15 14:26:08 2015 UTC,"Tri is a sequel to 02. It's focusing on the kids from Adventure the most, but it happens after 02 does. Three years after, in fact. Taichi and etc. are in high school, how could it be in between? Plus, it has already been confirmed that they are not ignoring 02 completely, it just isn't the focus here."
digimon,32nqf5,Smallkittenfeet,5,Wed Apr 15 21:04:03 2015 UTC,"More waiting for a release. At least I can watch the episodes of Adventure 01 again, hopefully they show the movies as well.  If we are lucky they'll also be subbed, which if they are, I will not be doing anything those 2 days."

digimon,32nqf5,crewnh,6,Wed Apr 15 06:46:54 2015 UTC,PV is a promotional video. So I imagine a first trailer will be available on the 6th.
digimon,32nqf5,Smallkittenfeet,4,Wed Apr 15 06:48:35 2015 UTC,Wait the anime itself isn't out on May 6th? It better come soon after that because doesn't the summer season start in Juneish?

digimon,32nqf5,megas88,3,Wed Apr 15 18:01:10 2015 UTC,I guarantee that that's because of the shadowing on him in this poster.

digimon,32q4jz,jayc1446,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:31:57 2015 UTC,"Nice video, got to work on your mic vs game volumes, can't hear you most of the video. Great picture though. Emulator or original game?  Also, the mechanics don't work for button mashing, give a command once like 'Attack' and that is what the digimon will focus on, just as 'Your Call' will allow the computer to make the decision to do what it wants (attack, block, evade). I tested this 'Attack' mashing on my Tyrannomon for my PS DW game and it did nothing to make him attack any more or any faster. Rapid Retro does this mashing in his DW videos too but less so, Meowing Kitten not at all. As you gain Brain stats you will gain more commands (250 will give you most of them (Your Call, Attack, Moderation, Distance, Change Opponents, and Run) and 300 gives Defend), but nothing highly specific such as what technique is used, which seems to again be by sheer chance of the three allowed at a time. That's the game type. Since it's real-time fight instead of turn based most big battles you will also be busy keeping up your mon's HP/MP/status error issues in check. Due to that you can't always be telling him what to do yourself (Your Call is my default even for Ultimate levels). Hope it helps a little and thanks for posting the video."
digimon,32q4jz,ryafur,2,Thu Apr 16 05:14:31 2015 UTC,"Once you reach brains 500+ you can also tell your Digimon what attack to use, so you don't have to deal with RNG attack selection anymore. (You can also activate only one move, to force what move your Digimon should use - speedrunners use that)"
digimon,32q4jz,SydMontague,1 point,Thu Apr 16 08:53:45 2015 UTC,"Nice to know, not sure if I'd ever train Brain stat that high unless I used chips to do it, there would be no time to hone the other stats especially for a specific evolution.

digimon,32q4jz,ryafur,0,Thu Apr 16 09:07:17 2015 UTC,"Hi Ryafur  Based on the above brains at 500 for an ultimate is probably average, i have done this previously with a metalgreymon :) super hard to get best off done with chips later game.   Keep an eye on my vids as ill let you know where to train certain moves and best way to get certain digimon as i have had pretty much everyone at one stage or another.   Just need to work on my mic to game volume haha."
digimon,32q4jz,ryafur,0,Thu Apr 16 20:05:15 2015 UTC,"Nice one :) Really appreciate the feedback this video has really took off for me, i noticed the mic to volume was a bit dodgy im using an emulator so need to look into how i can adjust the game volume. as for the mashing i didnt know that and i didnt even think of that tbh so  great piece of advice and ill give it a shout out in my part 2 video next monday.   Again thanks a lot (New to this only been doing it 3 weeks or so but im learning fast :P )"

digimon,32q2qh,EnkiiMuto,3,Wed Apr 15 20:18:24 2015 UTC,What exactly are you asking here?
digimon,32q2qh,likeagrapefruit,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:40:04 2015 UTC,"Edited, hope you understand now."
digimon,32q2qh,dotyawning,2,Thu Apr 16 23:35:22 2015 UTC,"TRANSLATION: OP is saying that the hardest digimon to measure in terms of power are fusions. and how do you determine the power of each new transformation. OP has a fanfic describing his thoughts on the subject but wants to know what we think. what does this sub think.  my answer: idk each digimon has power but it is not always the same also you may mistake ""skill"" and ""power"" as the same thing. some fusions are much weaker than others but are usually either faster or smarter. you are asking in terms of strength and power not in terms of full abilities.   edit: you define their power ""level"" by rank baby-mega (yea im american) but some digimon at mega have NO power but are a wall of defense. or to fast to hit. armor digvoltuions only go to champion they had to fuse in 02 to get past it as an armored digimon (besides the golden digi-egg of badassery.) and fusions have no ""level"" they are just a fusion in the end game you can't go past mega with a single digimon and only omnimon as far as i know of pasted mega him and alphmon but only due to fusion. however if you do 1X1 you get 1 (1X1=1) so 2 megas will lead to a mega, but unlike pokemon ""level"" and ""power"" mean nothing when ""skill"" and ""tactics"" are in play. a digimon with a weak punch can't break a wall, but he can run over it. finally no 2 digimon are the same even if in the same universe since digimon can evolve into many different evolutions."
digimon,32q2qh,KazyX,2,Thu Apr 16 22:09:10 2015 UTC,"For me,  it's closest to something like the Story games. The defined evolution stage determines your base and maximum power, but beyond that, any Digimon with training could easily take out someone multiple evolution levels higher than themselves.   That tournament in the end of one of the Story games where you fight Imperialdramon and some babies who utterly whoop you if you haven't taken advantage of evolving and devolving comes to mind."
digimon,32q2qh,likeagrapefruit,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:36:55 2015 UTC,"Just like /u/likeagrapefruit said, we don't understand what you are trying to say.  However, I am going to go on a limp and guess by your Xross comment you mean evolution and power levels.  The answer is simple, the power of a digimon is independent to their forms. Unlike previous seasons where you basically ""One Up"" the opponent by evolving, you have to rely on your training entirely.   t is possible for a Agumon who has trained for decades to snipe a Wargreymon, that had just evolved, through its shield at a distance. The concept of training your form is nothing new actually. Its touched upon in season 1, the Dark Masters mocked our heroes for thinking their fresh new megas could defeat them who had years of experience.  As for Digixross: if digimon A lacks speed but digimon B has trained movement a lot, you can just combine(xross) that characteristic to digimon A. For the most part Digixrosses allow you to pick a characteristic from material digimon and add it to the core digimon."

Still doesn't make any sense and stupid film overall

Maybe something kinda sorta simple, like a little carry case or a wallet? Somehow maybe you could rig it so it could open a close. Maybe keep loose change in it?

It might get a simultaneous release with english subtitles on crunchyroll or something, but there won't be a dubbed version for a while just because of how much work it is. They have to rewrite dialogue in english to fit mouth movements of characters and all sorts of other things."
digimon,32h7wa,welovekah,3,Mon Apr 13 22:28:59 2015 UTC,"Oddly enough Space Dandy came out with an English dub simultaneous with the original Japanese airing (actually a few hours before due to timezone differences).    This is pretty unprecedented, and owes mostly to the studio's deal with adult swim, but it is a neat trend I wouldn't mind seeing more of."
digimon,32h7wa,Sangui,2,Tue Apr 14 01:32:15 2015 UTC,It's like the ending season of the big o. Adult swim helped pay for it

digimon,32f4vi,D4an1el,6,Mon Apr 13 11:49:11 2015 UTC,"Well, it's basically just a macro that does press the ""Click!"" button every 1,5 seconds (actually, it skips the button and sends the request directly). I wrote a real bot ~2 month ago that can solve the puzzles you can play to get Nade-Nade points and it collected about 50k nade-nade within the last 4 weeks for me - and I certainly don't want to press this button 50.000 times by myself. ;)  Edit: and in case someone else is wondering, the ""DataTracker"" is a simple script that tracks the progress to create statistics."

While that may sound nice, I started to use up my 50k nade-nade at a rate of 0.66 nade-nade per second. So that would mean the rate has to drop when I stop doing nade-nade? Well, I did that about 1 hour ago and to my suprise it didn't even have a minor influence.   -> something smells fishy here. ;)"

digimon,32f4vi,SydMontague,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:56:00 2015 UTC,"The egg requires a certain number of Nade-Nade (reference to japanese Adventure episodes 12 and 54) until they hatch. Every click on the egg is one Nade-Nade. The goal for this egg (which will hatch Babumon, the baby form of Tentomon) are 200'000 Nade-Nade, which means you made 0,005% of the total goal with your 10 clicks.  So it's more or less designed as a community challenge. The reality seems to be different, though."
digimon,32f4vi,thisisdaleb,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:12:44 2015 UTC,Has anyone made an autoclicker for it?
digimon,32f4vi,SydMontague,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:15:24 2015 UTC,"Well, just create a macro for it, if you have software/hardware that supports that. However, from my observations, the whole thing looks a bit faked... (I have an autoclicker and my clicks do not get counted)"
digimon,32f4vi,thisisdaleb,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:26:18 2015 UTC,"yeah, I've been thinking that. Its more like a timer."
digimon,32f4vi,Smallkittenfeet,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:51:11 2015 UTC,So it is different from previous eggs or were they all faked as well?  Kinda makes me question what they are doing exactly.
digimon,32f4vi,SydMontague,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:36:24 2015 UTC,"The data I have from the last phase indicate, that it was mostly legit.  - the data has fluctuation based on local time - the data shows a massive motivation loss after the appearance of PicoDevimon - the data shows precicly when I started using my bot  However, the last few days, especially the last 4 hours, are doubtful. The rates were about 20 to 100 times higher than normal. Something happend there, and I'm sure it was not legit. (Not even 300k Nade-Nade were generated and used through points/games at that time - for all eggs)  What I think is, that Toei planned the rought hatch date previously based upon statistics.  That means PicoDevimon was part of the plan from the begining and they anticipated an average nade-nade rate of 0.25/s - a realistic value. However, they seem to have underestimated the motivation loss due to PicoDevimon. I observed a rate loss by the factor of 2 compared to pre-PicoDevimon values. But as the date was set, Toei was forced to move, as the community wasn't strong enough to reach the goal by themselfs. But as they noticed that too late, they were forced to do it without cover by injecting enormous amounts of nade-nade instead of doing a small batches multiple times.  Statistics are fun, but they are prone for errors. Don't trust them. ;)  PS: Total Avg Nade Rate: 0.89 Current Nade Rate: ~0.60, falling tendency"
digimon,32f4vi,Smallkittenfeet,2,Mon Apr 13 23:36:27 2015 UTC,"Interesting, now my curiosity was peaked thinking about.  Either it is sheer coincidence or the nade-nades aren't what the meter is counting at.  I did various tests, and the counter seems to be counting down in seconds, or this is very coincidental.  To put it simple, go to the page, make note of the number and at the same time start a stop watch. After 10 seconds, click back on to the page to ""refresh"" the number. 9 times out of 10, it is either exactly down by 10, or very close. Only once did it not come out right and I suspect it is because I wasn't paying full attention or as I said coincidental that 9 times it was exactly 10 or 1 off from 10 down after 10 seconds."
digimon,32f4vi,thecomposer42,1 point,Tue Apr 14 00:26:30 2015 UTC,I also did this. I feel like the egg should be hatching in another 12-24 hours. I did my rough math based on refresh for me which averaged about 4 every time.
digimon,32f4vi,SydMontague,1 point,Tue Apr 14 11:09:02 2015 UTC,"My current estimate is that we're currently about 48 hours away from hatching, probably less. The average rate is a bit below 0.8 and the current rate is a bit above 0.6 with rising tendency (it went down to <0.4 in the night [EU Time]).

digimon,32eyqt,CCRLS,1 point,Mon Apr 13 11:26:34 2015 UTC,"I have a Netflix account. I thought I checked and it wasn't available. Do you mean it's available for ordering, not streaming?"
digimon,32eyqt,CCRLS,5,Mon Apr 13 14:32:00 2015 UTC,"It's available for streaming. It's listed as the third season of ""Digimon: Digital Monsters"" for the english dub and the third season for ""Digimon Adventure"" for the Japanese version Edit: I from North America U.S not sure about other countries"
digimon,32eyqt,CCRLS,3,Mon Apr 13 14:54:06 2015 UTC,Yes I see it now! I never would have thought to look under the 3rd season of Digimon Adventure because of how separated Tamers is from Seasons 1&2. Thanks very much!
digimon,32eyqt,likeagrapefruit,4,Mon Apr 13 14:58:38 2015 UTC,Of course glad to help! I would complain about how they sorted it but honestly It's better than having it all spread out.

digimon,32eyqt,alexnichele,-1,Mon Apr 13 14:43:22 2015 UTC,Very simple solution: don't watch the dub.
digimon,32eyqt,SydMontague,1 point,Tue Apr 14 00:39:36 2015 UTC,Dubs not that bad...
digimon,32eyqt,SSJ5Gogetenks,-2,Wed Apr 15 05:25:41 2015 UTC,"I've seen a lot of english Tamers episodes on YouTube.    However, if you don't watch it for nostalgic reasons, I beg you to watch the original version with subtitles. (And when you watch it for nostalgic reasons I beg you to watch the original with subs, too.) The english versions of Digimon are so heavily modified, that I think people who only watched english dubs, haven't watched Digimon at all. (meaning: they haven't seen a show compareable to the japanese original)"
digimon,32eyqt,SydMontague,3,Mon Apr 13 08:13:14 2015 UTC,Tamers dub is great.
digimon,32eyqt,SSJ5Gogetenks,-2,Mon Apr 13 14:11:28 2015 UTC,You're being sarcastic right?
digimon,32eyqt,SydMontague,2,Mon Apr 13 14:24:32 2015 UTC,Nope. It avoids a lot of the problems that the Adventure/02 dub had. It's a solid effort.  You talk about people not having actually watched Digimon if they've only watched the dub but I get the distinct feeling you haven't actually watched the dub. :)
digimon,32eyqt,SSJ5Gogetenks,-3,Mon Apr 13 15:02:49 2015 UTC,"You're right, I haven't watched the english dub(s), only parts of it. I guess you've seen the original version of Tamers, on the other hand. But those parts I saw (and the interpolated knewledge I drew out of them) is by far enough to know, that the english version has major differences to the original version. I'm not gonna argue about voice acting and dialogues in Tamers, as I simply have no enough knowledge of it (even though the scenes I saw felt like the scheme they used in Adventure).  However, I know for sure that all the music of Tamers has been replaced in the english dub. Music, however, is one of the mayor layers of this art form. Replacing it completly is like covering 1/3 of the Mona Lisa with black and painting something different over it. You simply can't have seen the same show as I did, when 1/3 of it is something completly different."
digimon,32eyqt,SydMontague,5,Mon Apr 13 15:38:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the music is the primary failing of the Tamers dub. It's not a HUGE deal though, as the story is the same at the core and you get all the characterization and understanding of the character relationships, with some minor differences.  I do like some of the dub music like the Digivolution theme and Sakuyamon's biomerge theme."
digimon,32e0ya,Graizen,7,Mon Apr 13 00:43:21 2015 UTC,Does Agumon count as a video game character? I'm not sure if virtual pets would be considered video games.
digimon,32e0ya,likeagrapefruit,3,Mon Apr 13 02:47:39 2015 UTC,"Agumon (as well as many other Digimon) appeared in Digimon World, which is older than the Anime itself."
digimon,32e0ya,SydMontague,1 point,Mon Apr 13 08:35:02 2015 UTC,"But Agumon's first appearance was in the Digital Monster virtual pets, and Smash usually only includes characters who debuted in video games."
digimon,32e0ya,likeagrapefruit,3,Mon Apr 13 14:17:08 2015 UTC,"If they really wanted to, it wouldn't be much of a stretch to say that the original virtual pets are a form of video game. I mean, at the end of the day, what's the actual difference between a Digimon virtual pet and a Game & Watch?  That said, as much as I'd love for Agumon in Smash to happen, there really is no chance of it happening. He doesn't have the star power required to get enough votes to really make a splash. Plus, despite what I said above, his origins as a video game character are still nebulous, at best. Plus I doubt Nintendo ever actually considered the Pokemon/Digimon ""rivalry"" important enough to even take note of."

digimon,32e0ya,SydMontague,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:10:39 2015 UTC,"Ah, you already pointed out that Digimon isn't an Anime franchise. Ashes upon my head - that made my comment kind of pointless."
digimon,32e0ya,FinkleDude,5,Mon Apr 13 14:32:47 2015 UTC,"I just voted. I think it would be seriously cool to have Agumon in SSB4 because it would probably give a serious boost to the Digimon fan base, but - even if I am wildly over-optimistic - this is, unfortunately unlikely to happen.  Even though this will likely not happen, it still seems more likely than TK and Kari getting together in Tri."
digimon,32e0ya,pinkoctillery,2,Mon Apr 13 01:25:13 2015 UTC,"I would so, so love to have Agumon in Smash, but it will definitely never happen :("

digimon,32e0ya,biggest_dreamer,2,Mon Apr 13 17:17:36 2015 UTC,"as much as i would love this, it will not happen for now. to many people want banjoo kazzoe or K. Rool as the new character.  plus the other franchises you are voting against just are to big to out-vote with the digimon community : (, just like when pokemon first came around and digimon later,  ""NINTENDO"" is to well know and can promote damn near anything past what we digifans could do. take nintendo out of the picture and pokemon would not be as popular. also why not wargreymon???"
digimon,32e0ya,RoyalRamen,1 point,Mon Apr 13 01:11:40 2015 UTC,"Given that Super Smash has created the Smash Ball that could be the item that turns Agumon into WarGreymon momentarily. Like OP said, 'Agumon is the most representative Digimon for the Digimon franchise' Also not all fan bases are huge around the characters they've selected like the Wii Trainer."
digimon,32e0ya,KazyX,1 point,Mon Apr 13 12:16:25 2015 UTC,"Wii FitTrainer made sense for representing the wii-u and was not ""voted"" into the game it was a choice made my the developers and sakurai. and yea people recognize agumon however the amount of people i have seen asking for B&K or K Rool not to mention ACTUAL COMPANIES promoting their own characters to join smash, makes this a currently void effort imo maybe wait till the list of characters that out-shine digimon (which is by far a shit ton) shorten.  if wargreymon is the final smash he better not be like a pokmon and just walk i wann see nova flare."
digimon,32e0ya,MetroGamerX,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:14:38 2015 UTC,"The difference between WFT and Agumon is that Agumon would theoretically be DLC. They are going to want to make the DLC sell to as many people as they possibly can, so they can't afford to include a character without a huge following. There's a lot more leeway with the on-disc content, since WFT was obtained  alongside early 50 other characters and didn't make or break anyone's purchase by herself."

I have no interest in crafting an entire human character's appearance, personality, backstory etc (unfortunately, Digimon is one of those franchises I simply cannot come up with fun OCs for, no matter how I try), but I already have a Digimon character ready to go."
digimon,32dhxy,Wolfman666,1 point,Mon Apr 13 02:16:30 2015 UTC,What digimon you thinking.  The only real downfall to playing a digimon only is that you can't leave the digital worlds (unless something happens story wise later)

Whether it's a good idea for you or not, I don't know, but it seems like you've put in some serious thought about it. Seems like a cool tattoo to have to me, but if your the type of person that gets into fights and arguments a lot, having a tattoo that means ""Take It Easy"" may not be the best idea. If you are a laid back person then it could be a good tattoo to get.   But hey, it's your decision, so make what you think is the right choice."

digimon,32abhs,Smallkittenfeet,2,Sun Apr 12 00:46:47 2015 UTC,The last egg was hatched on March 10. It has now been over a month since it was hatched with no real sign of the next egg. I'm honestly starting to lose hope.
digimon,32abhs,snugglelove,2,Sun Apr 12 05:19:38 2015 UTC,"So it has been longer than the others, the others were usually within a week or two."
digimon,32abhs,WogTheBog,3,Sun Apr 12 05:28:10 2015 UTC,the one that just hatched took like 2+ months to get released
digimon,32abhs,WogTheBog,1 point,Sun Apr 12 06:11:22 2015 UTC,"Hmm, either way the fact we are now in the spring season you think they would have released the new egg on the day the season started."

digimon,32abhs,SydMontague,0,Sun Apr 12 10:41:53 2015 UTC,"Yes but during those years we had other seasons and such. Then they come out of the blue with this, dangled a bunch of eggs in front of us, and a general season and then now when the season starts, it's like they just go ""We got em gud""."

Waiting doesn't kill us (actually it does, but you know what I mean) and we can use the time to watch the one or another season of Digimon. Also, I've stopped to trust release dates for a long time now. ;)"

I'm amazed. ;) (To compare it: even if germany would switch out the GoT theme, it wouldn't be the GoT theme. So if the US switches out the Digimon theme it doesn't become the Digimon theme.)"
digimon,328rpg,SydMontague,7,Sat Apr 11 16:37:07 2015 UTC,It's the theme to the season 1 intro.  I know there is a longer version of it but is there one that is completely different?
digimon,328rpg,yayachan,10,Sat Apr 11 16:45:18 2015 UTC,"It is, its just the English version of the theme. He probably was thinking of Japanese version or whatever language he watched digimon in."
digimon,328rpg,SydMontague,-4,Sat Apr 11 16:52:23 2015 UTC,"The ""theme"" for season one is the melody of ""Butterfly"" (the japanese intro) which got used in every single localization except the US one."

Sorry if I seemed a bit rude. ;)"
digimon,328rpg,MrDooves,7,Sat Apr 11 17:11:55 2015 UTC,"I think people are aware that different countries and languages often got their own Versions of Cartoon themes.

If it plays at the beginning of a cartoon for a huge chunk of the world viewing it, then Of Course its the theme. Its not like we all watched some cheap bootlegged knock off, so stop being pedantic. Its just not the Only theme, and literally everybody knows that. Trolls get downvotes, that shouldn't surprise you."

Now you think this discussion has to be warmed up again?  To be honest, you might be not completly wrong marking me as troll (my first comment does not earn the predicate ""diplomatic""), but rest assured that I don't do that for the purpose of trolling, but because I have very strong emotions when it comes to the english dub of Digimon.   If people were aware that the US theme is not the theme the majority of the world got to hear (only US and french dub used the US song - every other nation I know of used Bufferfly), they'd specify themselfs when talking about the one or another opening song. It's not their fault for not knowing it and the next time I point this out I'll try to communicate this fact a bit better.  PS: I have to admit, even though I don't like the US Intro, it's still somewhat catchy. ;)"
digimon,328rpg,SydMontague,3,Wed Apr 15 20:52:30 2015 UTC,"You however do win full points for rounding off this debate in a diplomatic way. We can all agree that everything has merit, and there is room for every version and every opinion:-) Well met sir, and no hard feelings."
digimon,328rpg,MrDooves,0,Thu Apr 16 00:44:21 2015 UTC,Canada and Europe used this theme as well:-)
digimon,328rpg,SydMontague,2,Sat Apr 18 04:05:19 2015 UTC,"Canada yes. Europe is a mixed case. I know of the UK, France, Sweden and Czech that they used the US theme, but also from Germany (-> german speaking countries), Portugal, Spain and Finnland that they used the melody of Butterfly. Oddly enough, Italy used neither of both. Actually, I have to admit that more european countries used the US theme than I thought.  Oh, and every country used this song for ""Digimon - The Movie""."

While every single localization studio in the world (Edit: except the french) decided to keep the soundtrack, Saban thought it would be a good Idea to switch out one of the most important layers in this art form with some crappy 80's US cartoon music. (And they didn't do well in the other layers, like dialogue, as well)  The original Soundtrack and how it got used is almost perfect I'd say. (It even interprets one of the most famous neo-classical pieces of the 20th century - Joaquín Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez) Just watch the show subbed - I gurantee you, you won't regret it."

It also got me interested a little bit in theology because it was based on the Abrahamic mythos, and I found it fascinating that they were able to play with it in a way that I don't think an American cartoon would've.

And absolutely everywhere they always say ""oh, well meet again, well see eachother again, im sure of it."" and now that they're confident enough to make another adventure series, im confident that they'll go forth and answer the promises they made in the many ending scenes for Tamers."
digimon,322jx5,HoboLove101,2,Fri Apr 10 05:07:07 2015 UTC,"Going off of your idea; Put it the tamers in high school (like tri) and have  Henery's project accidentally opens up hundreds of gates in the digital world without him realizing it at the time. We get shown the aftermath of Digimon and the D-Reaper before anything else happens and how the world currently works and is handling things. The first Digimon to go through runs into Takato who is then attacked but saved by Guilmon. The two have their reunion, telling each other about their lives and for the next bit, it's them doing stuff alone/getting through problems they may have with each other since it would be around 6 years since they last saw each other. After this, Rika and Renamon reunite but are still perfect for each other and join Takato on protecting their city. For the next bit we get the reunion of all the side characters and their Digimon. Throughout all of this, Henery would be sitting on the side lines, with the stress of trying to fix his project and the whole while he has no idea where Terriermon is. He begins to space himself from the others and starts to go insane, and right when we think we lose him, Terriermon finally comes back and brings him back. Now that the whole gang is back together, they decide to try and shut down the gates between worlds and after that is accomplished, face a new terror that can be directly linked to when Guilmon turned into Megidramon.  The one thing I really want out of this season is Takato and Guilmon going above Crimson mode, just to add something new."
digimon,322jx5,Drymvir,1 point,Fri Apr 10 23:17:13 2015 UTC,"And then watch them go ""oh, that guy did all the work for us!""  I wonder if they look at these american posts at all for ideas on future shows. Someone should repost ideas here in some Japanese forum. hahaha.  Honestly though, thats the best idea for (at least) a fanfiction that i've heard. Saving that comment.  Edit: I definitely want to see more of Megidramon, but in a way where it doesn't seem forced."
digimon,322jx5,HoboLove101,2,Fri Apr 10 23:54:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, for my idea, I would like the Megidramon part to slowly make it's way for the big reveal, just creeping on us."
digimon,322jx5,thisisdaleb,3,Sat Apr 11 00:32:56 2015 UTC,I did a review a couple of days ago.  I never watched Digimon before. Do you agree or disagree with any of my thoughts?
digimon,322jx5,Drymvir,2,Fri Apr 10 07:33:30 2015 UTC,"Impmon being forgiven officially, right before the very end of the anime, is one of the most happy moments in anime for me. It's strange, because right after that, one of the most depressing moments in anime happens. The ending is such a roller coaster of happiness from the forgiveness, lonely depression from the leaving, and then a pondering hope when Takato finds the small portal. And then theres the audio drama; Takato's explanation raises anger for the adults for probably lying, and a mixture of sadness and hope when you hear about Henry's project. You know its a feasible way for a continuation, but you see how long its been and you just break down from that hope.   I really hope they don't abandon this wonderful universe like they do for the rest of their universes. Although the act of them going back and revisiting Adventure gives me hope that they will do the same for Tamers. On the other hand, it has been over a decade... but then again, it's been over a decade since Adventures and they still went back for it. It's a lot of wishful calculating that just tests your faith in the producers of the show."
digimon,322jx5,HoboLove101,3,Fri Apr 10 13:11:19 2015 UTC,"Well Adventure Tri was to try and re-hook western audiences, and I'm pretty sure we all either put Tamers as the best or second best with Adventure being in the same spot... There's more hope then one would think."
digimon,322jx5,SydMontague,2,Fri Apr 10 13:40:36 2015 UTC,"I saw your post when I was about 10 episodes in. And I made evaluations based on yours. My main thing is that I wish people who dissed on Tamers would give it more of a chance. I once saw a post that said Adventures 02 even had a better story line than Tamers. I got really mad that day. I even believe that Tamers is better than 01 for the sheer fact that Tamers was the first Digimon I ever saw. And that all of the Deus Ex Machina weirdness at the end of 01 with Apocalomon I wish was more fleshed out and not rushed into two episodes. I really liked D-Reaper as it was neither Digimon nor Human so there would be no, "" Oh hey look now I'm good, my ways were misguided"" type stuff. The pure hatred for life was so surreal. I love this series and will defend it to the end of time."
digimon,322jx5,Drymvir,2,Fri Apr 10 14:02:48 2015 UTC,"A thing I find funny about Tamers is that many mayor plot points are simply mirrored from Adventure (season one). In Adventure humans are thrown into the digital world, in Tamers the Digimon are thrown into the analog world*. In Adventure the heros have to go into the analog world for a period of time, in Tamers they have to go to the digital world for a period of time. In Adventure the digital world is a unconcious creation (nobody intended to create it), in Tamers it's a concious creation (somebody intended to create it). In Adventure the ""main goal"" is to safe the digital world, in Tamers the main goal is to safe the analog world. In Adventure the humans have to leave the digital world, in Tamers the Digimon have to leave the analog world.    And that's the reason I find it hard to compare Adventure and Tamers - they're different in many ways and both do an incredibly good job at what they are. I think the final judgement boils down to different valuation of certain aspect of the shows. But there are people claiming 02 had a better story than Tamers? I must have missed something in the ~6 times I've watched 02 in my lifetime so far... However, that's another funny thing: many things they failed to use properly in 02 got used in Tamers, like the Cthulhu myth, the secret life aspect of the protagonists, the antihero/remorseful character (even though 02 did well with Ken and BlackWargreymon) and much more.  *I refuse to use the term ""real world"", as this would suggest the digital world is unreal - which is not the case"
digimon,322jx5,aes110,2,Fri Apr 10 23:55:40 2015 UTC,I definitely see where you're coming from. I noticed the parallels too. It all boils down to the fact I saw Tamers before I even knew what divining specifically was.

digimon,322jx5,windwalker13,2,Fri Apr 10 21:29:10 2015 UTC,"I know it's done to death in all forms of digimon fan fiction for all the series, But I believe Tamers 2, if allowed to exist, should focus on Consequences. Think about it, the aftermath of the D-Reaper in the human world, How the governments around the world respond, PTSD of certain characters (used for character development), Megidramons awakening, the digital catalyst being revealed and used on the entire digital world, the fall of the Sovereigns (suggested from Zhuqiaomon's defeat at the hands of the D-reaper), distrust of adults, and finally a threat raising from the D-Reapers defeat. Most Fanfics only focus on a couple of these while Tamers could do it all well and has the perfect universe in it. I think its perfect since unlike other digimon series, it could benefit and use this as its advantage and give us a Story that both writes itself and can bring something new that fits into the Semi-realistic world of Tamers."

If characters, then of course they don't get seen that often; almost every installment of Digimon is its own standalone universe, so they wouldn't share characters.  If species, then quite a few do get reused. They don't reuse all of them, partly because they still want to introduce new species and partly because some of them are special cases (Guilmon, for example, is an artificial species, so there really shouldn't be too many of them running around)."
digimon,31xdfc,bakodude,1 point,Wed Apr 8 22:22:39 2015 UTC,"I understand the 'special cases' problem, and support it. It would get annoying if something like that were to pop up again and again.  But I was referring to species in the existing seasons, and then later referring to reuse of characters in future seasons.   I had the idea of more sequels to past seasons after seeing the trailer for Adventure Tri. The claim to digimon 'coming back' in the trailer made me think of going back to the old stories and expand them.
