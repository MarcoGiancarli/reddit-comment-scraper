It cuts down the efficacy of pair bonding and men know that. Your personal self worth doesn't matter, it's how likely you are to be able to commit. And despite your personal beliefs about your ability to commit, it naturally goes down if you have even one partner before marriage. Consider this: two women both have lots of sex, say 200 times. One woman with one or two men 200 times/100 times each, and the other with many men maybe two or three times each. Who do you think has men lining up to marry her?"

SlutJustice,3dwzso,Turn_Coat,9,Tue Jul 21 04:15:45 2015 UTC,"You simplify human interactions to almost a childish level of understanding.   Begin with an insult. Clearly not childish :)))   Women who have the audacity to have sex with more than 1 partner by the time they are 30 aren't broken.   Then how do you explain the no-divorce rate for virgins going from 80 to around 56%  for women with just 1 partner? Oh and what is oxytocin and its effect on women and pair bonding?   They don't respect themselves less.   But i respect them less.   Excuse us women for celebrating and enjoying sexuality instead of being sexually deprived and denying ourselves pleasure by sitting at home on Saturday nights and holding out for prince charming in order to have ""self respect.""   Like ive said before i dont care. I'm not gonna marry you nor am i gonna date you.  I may fuck you but that's gonna be pretty much it. You can be beautiful or independent, you want whoredom? Fine by me, now suck on my dick and shut the fuck up. You're annoying and not worth listening to.   Meanwhile prince charming fucks the whole town.    Any woman can stand on a bar table, scream ""i just got dumped and need some dick"" and she'll get it. A guy does this and he gets kicked out of the bar. Its easy to be a slut, its HARD to be a stud. It cant be a double standard when the playing field is not the same nor when women PREFER the experienced man over the virgin man. You'll ignore this though.   Believe it or not WOMEN DO love sex!   I know, how do you think i got laid as often as i did?   You think it's only fun for you?   No but it wont make me an unreliable partner as a man. Quite the contrary it makes me a better catch for you but does the opposite when you sleep around.   Maybe you think that because in your experiences with sex it's only been fun for you and not your partner. Maybe you should learn some fucking skills in bed. Goodness.   Maybe you should learn some self control and not hop on a new dick every night you fucking slut.   I am a college student in liberal, Jewish NYC. Yes, you're looking at a Jewish feminist, you disgusting, inbred, redneck goyim!    How does it feel being bottom of the trash bin in terms of the dating pool? Slut, feminist, kike AND lives in Jew York Shitty? I wouldn't touch you with a 39 and a half foot pole.   Anyways, it is SO HARD to have a relationship.    No one wantw a relationship witha whore? Surprise surprise!   I am gorgeous (not gonna lie to you or myself. And it really boils your blood that a woman owns it and is CONFIDENT about their beauty, doesn't it?)   Oh you're serious? Let me laugh even harder ahahahahahahaha   and it makes things HARDER   If you're as beautiful as you say you are dating would be easy. So either you're a whore or you're an ugly whore in denial who just admitted to this on her own. Dat Freudian slip.   even though you shallow thinking morons think that beautiful women don't ever lift their fingers (I've worked goddamned hard in my life) and have guys fawning over them. NEWSFLASH. Men go after attainable women who appear outwardly confident.    Confirmed you have no idea how men work.   Men are attracted to the ALPHA lady, wow!    Absolutely no fucking idea.   All of you inbreds talk about how women need alpha males, but you'll fawn over ugly bitches just because they think they're hot.    Not even but I'll agree that too many ""men"" settle for whores and fat cunts when they should ask for better. But when men date down and dating is hard for you as a beautiful woman you oust yourself as the ugly whore you are. Oh do i love these rants.   And gorgeous women who are confident (like me)    Because if you repeat it enough it will come true.   are so intimidating   Oh god she doesnt realize ""intimidating"" is the nice way to turn someone down hahahaha   that no one ever approaches them.   Yeah, everyone in a relationship just magicallg paired up somehow.   I LIKE SEX TOO. AT A PRIMAL, PHYSICAL LEVEL. JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER WOMAN.   But i dont want any other woman, i want someone that has self control and decency regarding sex. So, like plenty of men before me, i will not even consider touching you.    And I still fuck this fuckboy. And contrary to popular belief, he is VERY attractive and successful    Just like you are right? Hahahaha   and doesn't sleep around because he himself has trouble getting women in bed. Why?    Because hes a pussy that cabt do any better than the bottom of the trash bin of dating. Actions speak louder than words.    CONFIDENCE.   If he had some he wouldnt be dating a whore.   It's not a gender thing. Your pop culture psychology is WRONG.    Which is why you came here?

IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND ONE AS A VIRGIN. COULD I NOT FIND ONE THEN CAUSE I WAS A WHORE? I GUESS I WAS A WHORE BEFORE I EVEN HAD SEX?!?! Or maybe because relationships aren't as simple as you suggest?   No but it wont make me an unreliable partner as a man. Quite the contrary it makes me a better catch for you but does the opposite when you sleep around.   you do realize that there are things that women can do in bed, too? That require just a bit of experience? A woman who's had sex a few times is going to be better in bed than a virgin.

The irony of this is you dont seem to get that I Do Not Believe You. How you write says more than what you say happens to you. Because a hot virgin is a catch, and if guys avoid you like a leper either your personality is so shit you may as well be a whore in their eyes, or you simply are straight up lying about your situation and are nowhere near as hot as you think. Its not uncommon either, a lot of average girls think they're hot shit because some alphas go for the low hanging fruit.    IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND ONE AS A VIRGIN. COULD I NOT FIND ONE THEN CAUSE I WAS A WHORE? I GUESS I WAS A WHORE BEFORE I EVEN HAD SEX?!?! Or maybe because relationships aren't as simple as you suggest?   A one night stand isnt a relationship. If you were turning down guys left and right for that then its on you for not getting laid.   you do realize that there are things that women can do in bed, too? That require just a bit of experience?   Id rather have her practice and earn experience with me than with 12 other guys. And if i want a woman with experience why not get a prostitute? If experienced is what i want i may as well go all out and just buy it. My girlfriend and i are looking into anal. Do i have to take it slow for now as we stretch her out? Yeah. Am i glad I'm the first to be in there? You bet and i wouldn't have it any other way.    A woman who's had sex a few times is going to be better in bed than a virgin.   I'm used to doing much of the work anyways. It also doesn't take that long to teach her how to bounce on my dick. In fact it took my virgin girlfriend just a few seconds to get it right. You say you're no whore but you definitely have a huge whore defense mechanic indicating to me you're promiscuous and hurt by my words. Because they are true.   Maybe you get off to the idea of the inexperience and corruption and that's what does it for you.    I get off to not fucking the town bike.   But as far as being better at sex, I don't think there's an argument.    Youre right, I'll go after prostitutes when i want best sex and date my virgins. Your own argument removes you from the dating pool lmfao.   My skills have definitely improved.. Lmao and there is no scientific evidence that women release more oxytocin during sex than men. Next.   There is to suggest it impairs your abilities to form bonds though. Nice try whore. Next.   Lol have fun with your inbred, bimbo Christian girl because that's about the only one who's waiting for you. Lmao   You clearly have never been to asian or russian speaking countries. You know, the place american guys are expatriating to? I wonder why? Maybe it has to do with the more traditional women present there...   Not dating.   So i was right, alpha fucking the low hanging fruit who gets an inflated ego out of it. Oh my god I love being right. If only you could see the smile on my face.   He's a neuroscientist and I am an opera singer and composer.    Good to know even my first insults were right, only good for sucking cock with those vocal chords.   Your feeble redneck mind just doesn't understand NYC culture.    You mean degenerate culture.    People in NYC don't have all the time in the world like you bumfuckers. We have sexual needs and take care of them and go back to our amazing, busy lives.    How sad is that? Work work work work work, sex is like a fucking handshake and then back to work? You've confirmed everything I've said while failing to realize it yourself. This is the one moment ive gone from laughter to pity, how sad must you be to want this kind of life as opposed to one whose main emphasis is joy and love?    I'm a troll and this was fun.   You've looked up sources and argued your point across the board and continued from last night. This sounds like you've surrendered and are attempting a last ditch effort at coming off as having ""won"" the argument because ""i was just trolling"".   You've provided a window into your mind and now that I've given the analysis you've gone to the most base defense. But i know its not true and YOU know I'm right. If you ever wanna start getting some dates and behave more like a woman men would respect, we're here when you need us.   I am so glad you archived it, I'll be jerking off to your laughter.    If you jerk off at us laughing at you when you're supposed to be a troll its evidence that you're not a troll and in fact deadly serious in your posts."

The reason guys are looking to Russia and Asia for women is because they're poor, disadvantaged and easy to convince to marry. And they're culture makes them submissive. They get married to guys overseas because they want to eat. Is it coincidence you referenced the two geographic regions in which mail order brides commonly come from? Oh my god. LMFAO  Like I said, I don't care if you believe me. I know what I look like. But GODDAMN I wish I could just post a picture of myself, and I would if you creeps wouldn't take the picture, save it, and try to figure out my identity and ruin my life in the future.   Dude, did you not ever read my post in the first place? I clearly called him my fuckboi. I'm kind of baffled that you're all like ""I KNEW IT!!"" Like, if you had reading comprehension you would have figured it out the first time? Like I said, we actually have feelings for each other. I told him I didn't want a relationship after he'd been trying for months. We're very close but I just don't have the energy to date right now. If you also had reading comprehension you'd know that I detailed that I had a boyfriend before this guy. I lost my virginity to my BOYFRIEND. I didn't just learn from 50 dicks like you assumed LMFAO. And you must not know what a good blowjob is if you think that everything a girl can learn she'll learn the first time having sex. One question, has that girl married you? Or has she found someone else and fucked just as many people as me? Making her a whore?  Again reading comprehension.   Opera singer and COMPOSER   I am a multi- instrumentalist and am good for much more than my vocal chords- I play violin, viola, cello, electric and classical bass, piano, harp, keyboard, mandolin, guitar, and saxophone. I literally compose symphonies. But I forgot that women are stupid and can't do anything, right?  It's somehow proof that you're right because I like to rustle jimmies and start conflict? Literally the definition of a troll. I'm jerking off to this because damn its kinky. If you don't get that I'm not sure there's much I can do for your feeble mind.

SlutJustice,3dwzso,Staff_of_Prana,5,Mon Jul 20 17:32:45 2015 UTC,"I do not hate promiscuous women. I pity them, and hate those who have led them astray. Those who have actively taken part in the destruction of tradition with the intent of breaking their souls, and weakening the institution of marriage. The Jews have been at the forefront of this venomous movement, they hate everything about traditional European society.   I have a great deal of sympathy for the (non-Jewish) promiscuous woman. But no respect whatsoever. I pray for them every day, I cannot conclude that they have dug their own graves. I am against holding women accountable for their actions; they are like children. They can be cruel, they can be devious, but ultimately, it is wrong to expect from them that which I expect from men. Make no mistake that it is White men who have failed most horrifically in the past century. Jews are vipers and women are sheep, both have fulfilled these roles adequately. European men used to be lions, but all the lions were led to their deaths by traitorous elites, in two consecutive generations. Cowards survived those catastrophes, and it is from their seed that our societies have been poisoned.   The final destination of my soul is of no consequence to me. If, by vehemently opposing (what you call ""hating"") those who corrupt the souls of otherwise innocent children, I condemn my soul to Hell, so be it. To live with the intention of ascending to Heaven is the ultimately selfish lifestyle. My children and theirs need me far more than Jesus does.

At this point, it's not even about cuckery but about treason against civilization as we know it, and, frankly the entire human race.  ""He"" writes:    She didn’t present it as an issue of feminism to me, but after much soul-searching about why the idea of my wife having sex with other men bothered me I came to a few conclusions: Monogamy meant I controlled her sexual expression, and, not to get all women’s-studies major about it, patriarchal oppression essentially boils down to a man’s fear that a woman with sexual agency is a woman he can’t control.   No.  No no no no.  One slut isn't a bad thing.  Ten sluts isn't.  The issue is that sluts undermine society, and men, realizing they have no power over the conception, birth, and rearing of their children check out of civilization-building altogether, either retreating into HFCS-gorged weaboo degeneracy or Red-Pill hedonistic-nihilistic debauchery.     Men are resilient; we'll get over wives or girlfriends being whores.  The problem is that society rewards them, and so sluts have gone from being a curiosity to be enjoyed by cads and shunned by everyone else to the standard, and that is dangerous.  As the Venerable Archbishop Fulton J Sheen said, ""When a man loves a woman, he has to become worthy of her. The higher her virtue, the more noble her character, the more devoted she is to truth, justice, goodness, the more a man has to aspire to be worthy of her. The history of civilization could actually be written in terms of the level of its women.""   Our women are whores, and so our society is whorish and teetering.   It gets dumber, though:   if she only likes sex with her husband or boyfriend, she’s boring and lame   Uh, not to her boyfriend or husband?  This, too, is part of them problem.  Only a woman would actually give a shit about what degenerates thought about her.  Who cares if the town-whore thinks you're boring?  A woman doesn't. But if the town is all whores, and they all think she's boring, well then that female-brain is going to correct her ""deviant"" (as in from the norm"" behaviour and be a whore like the group, unless ""reprogramming"" from faith and family prevent it.    What’s important is equality of opportunity, not outcome.   HAHAHA.  Apply this to the political arena you liberal fuck and I might back down and ""tolerate"" you.     Anyway, that's all for now.

SlutJustice,3cpqp5,-Slutlord-Fascist-,20,Thu Jul 9 20:04:05 2015 UTC,"tl;dr: /u/OKCfatchickthrowaway would rather be alone than not stuff her face with grease.  This is how fucked up fat sluts are.   He told me that he was ""OK"" with my weight, but only if I planned to lose weight. He couldn't see himself with someone fat, long-term. He never told me I was sexy. We broke up.   Yeah, I'm okay with you being a porker, but y'know, I'm not going to marry or have kids with a blimp who is dead before 60.   Rob liked my body. He liked my fat belly and squishy arms. He asked me if I would lay on top of him, just laying there, as he liked the weight. He jerked off to chubby-girl porn in front of me but when I got myself off (he didn't ""feel like doing it"",) he said it was a turn-off. I guess I wasn't important as anything more than an embodiment of his fat fetish.   Right.  He was a fetishist.  He could never love or care for you the same reason that BDSM relationships are filled with freakshows: because his desire for you was founded on aberrant sexual impulse, not a loving, caring relationship.   Hugh said his best lover was a bigger girl. He struggled to maintain an erection during sex and preferred sex with his eyes closed. Eventually the struggle of keeping him hard took its toll and we stopped fucking. He'd ""never had this problem with anyone else.""   Just how fat is this bitch?   I went on a first date with Jed wearing a sexy red dress and he ended the date ten minutes in because I was ""so much bigger than he'd thought."" I pointed out my no-angle/no-filter full body shot and he said ""I guess I didn't think you were that big.""   She probably gained weight.   Christian bragged of his prowess in bed, his dominance, his unfailing need to thoroughly pleasure a woman before they even had sex. The uncomfortable look on his face mid-coitus prompted me to ask if someone was wrong, and he admitted that he was only fucking me because he was addicted to sex and didn't actually want to have sex with me.   A man finds a woman's morbid obesity undesirable.  What the fuck is wrong with him.   Aaron was more than a date or a fling, he was my boyfriend. The sex started out phenomenal, then slowly waned. One day, after he initiated a ""quickie,"" he tearfully confessed that he loved being with me but found my weight unattractive and it made him dread having sex with me.   Wonder if she ever tried to lose weight?  Nah.  She preferred to feed on donuts rather than maintain the relationship.   Chris (not to be confused with Christian) was a big dude. I thought I'd found someone who didn't care about my weight. The sex was all right. He texted me after two dates to say that he was sorry for being a hypocrite, but he didn't think he could date a fat girl after all.  Sam and I hooked up for over a year. We went to movies together, dinner, museums, hikes. But I never met his friends and we were never dating. Finally he told me, more or less, that he was embarrassed that I was so much less attractive than him. I pointed out that he said I was beautiful, and he told me my face was beautiful.   Look, honey, the common denominator is you.  Your fat, to be specific.  LOSE THE WEIGHT AND YOU CAN FIND A MAN."

SlutJustice,3cp2vy,dvgn,18,Thu Jul 9 17:08:10 2015 UTC,"I asked her why had sex with somebody who likely raped her? She says that it is some kind method to validate the first time. I asked her if the first time was as non-consensual as she thinks now it is. She got mad, and started shouting that I am a 'pro-rapist'.   Validation is not something you consciously go after. It's shameful for victims to admit that that's what they were doing, it literally hurts to think that they went off to befriend their abuser. They usually blame themselves or are horrified that it happened... they don't explain it away with unashamed armchair psychology. That kind of self-awareness is not used as a defense by actual victims.   Yelling in response to a loved one's concern means you're hiding something, that you want them to back off so they don't discover the truth.  Sorry, /u/curious_abot_gf, but this girl is a fucking liar. She's hooking up behind your back and doing an absolutely EVIL thing by crying rape. Please leave her before she gives you an STD."
SlutJustice,3cp2vy,_Kahlo,15,Thu Jul 9 19:51:51 2015 UTC,"From the comments:    The validation thing is legitimate. Basically how this works is that a lot of times when someone experiences rape, they desperately want to feel like it was something ""more"" or ""different,"" and so they pursue additional encounters with the person, in order to make the rape into part of a relationship or at least to make it feel more like (in their head) part of a consensual interaction. The human mind really, really hates to feel like it doesn't have control over any situation, even when it's abundantly clear that it doesn't.  Of course she is going to react with anger or hurt when you question whether her rape experience is real.    These assholes will plumb the depths of illogic to convince themselves that a false rape accusation is an impossibility, even in situations that are in no way ambiguous.   What is rape to a feminist? Anything they want it to be.   The saddest thing is that no one even tells the guy the obvious truth that she's a liar – most likely because that sub is a feminist ""safe space,"" which means any common sense will be immediately deleted in favor of bald-faced lies that encourage people to date sociopaths and abusers. Because that's ""safer."""
SlutJustice,3cp2vy,_Kahlo,12,Thu Jul 9 21:26:43 2015 UTC,"Admittedly, I was one of those girls who ""sought validation."" It's about to get TMI up in here, skip down to the bolded word if you don't care or want to know.   My virginity was unwillfully taken from me by a guy in my class, after he drank a lot (I was too freaked out by the idea of being intoxicated to also drink) and we were home alone (I was being stupid and naive). I even tried to fool him into thinking he'd had sex, but hadn't actually, but he persevered. Then I tried to date him. It was better (in my thoughts) if he liked me and was just dumb the first time. I wanted him to love me because sex happens when people are in love, and otherwise what am I supposed to do? I'd been taken and didn't want to ever have more than one man know me, that'd been so important to me my whole life. But, he rejected me. That hurt almost as bad as what happened. I actually kept trying, now wondering why he would've done that if he didn't even want me again. It made it a lot worse, totally masochistic. I started refusing to shower or look in the mirror, stopped wanting to experiencing physical sensations period. I developed anorexia nervosa. I tried to just disappear and never deal with anyone. It was definitely depression. I never talked to anyone, no friends or parents or even a diary entry, and still don't IRL even now. It happened again when I was 20, and I repeated the same pattern with the guy. I didn't learn or heal from it, much less recognize what was happening and excuse my behavior! I drifted through life, and even now my memories of that time aren't clear.  THAT is ""validation seeking."" I would never scream at loved ones that they're being pro-rape if they requested details. Sure, every girl is different, but there are commonalities among the responses to victimization. This girl is waving all the red flags of a faker. Fakers are maybe just as damaging for the issue of rape as rapists are... They trivialize it and ruin the ability of justices and therapists to effectively help victims. They're co-opting tragedy in order to get what they want.  The girls who lie about this sort of thing don't deserve the air they breathe or the love they receive. They are disgusting, evil people."

SlutJustice,3cp2vy,BustaHymes,3,Tue Jul 14 15:58:56 2015 UTC,"This story was upsetting to me. It touches on the topic of differences, both cultural and innate, between men and women. A man doesn't need to be taught that unwanted sexual advances are justification for a violent response, but many women do. Why our daughters aren't taught this concept at home and school is beyond me. It's unpleasant, but nothing compared to the trauma that you experienced.  If a man is touching a woman in ways she doesn't want, it's time to start clawing his eyes out. That'll stop 99% of them, and give the DA the evidence he needs to lock up the other 1%. Nothing like a bloodied up face to settle the matter of consent."
SlutJustice,3cp2vy,_Kahlo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:45:19 2015 UTC,"Well, thank you for the compassion. Surprisingly enough, this sub feels like a safe haven.  I was not provided with sex education or really told anything about men or love. My education was limited to inferences garnered from third party observation. The first time happened when I was 13, so I had absolutely no skills to process it. The second time, I felt trapped and like it was absolutely all my fault for being in that situation to begin with. I used drugs to avoid the realities of both times.  It really is at least partially my fault for having a ""bad picker"" and associating with unstable persons. I and my therapists mostly attribute this tendency to my having been raised by a mentally unstable mother. I was also attacked again 3 years ago, though thankfully that time was only violently rather than sexually. That time, I am proud to say that I recognized the danger and got myself out of it as quickly as possible. He had had a psychotic break. I did not feel ""empowered"" or strong enough or whatever to go through with pressing charges, but I did make sure his mother got him got some mental healthcare.  I was raised by ""strong"" people. My entire family owns many weapons and some of my earliest memories involve field dressing elk. I wasn't raised conservative either - I genuinely think the parental neglect was due to my being an unplanned bastard. No one in my family was willing or able to parent me full-time, so a lot fell through the cracks. Cannot advocate enough for only having sex once a woman is ready to be a mother. Hopefully I have learned enough to do better by my own children. I similarly hope that by telling my stories, others will be able to recognize what happens with many women, and things might somehow improve."

The people (mostly women) at /r/sex are basically trying to cover for her because they too suffer from what I am about to tell you.  In regards to women, our sex drive is like a well. You can only take from the well so much until it's empty. Considering she had hour long fucking sessions with this guy (at least three which she filmed), he has a big penis, and she loved sucking him off I would venture a pretty safe guess that she preferred his sex to yours. If she liked your sex more, wouldn't she be asking for 1.5 hour long sessions? Wouldn't she want to give you  MORE blowjobs in comparison to her ex? She had her poundings and now she wants a safe/secure guy to cuddle up to now that she got that experimenting out of her system. Unfortunately, you still have wants and needs that need fulfillment and she isn't interested in doing that.  Plus, why would she be ACTING for her own homemade porn? She didn't have a director or audience to impress like pornstars do. It was a private moment between her and him and the tape was probably only distributed to the two of them.  Who knows what that guy did with the copy of the video because you can bet your ass he has a copy. What if it's floating around on the internet--do you really want to have videos circulating of your girlfriend getting nailed by a huge cock when she doesn't even give you blowjobs? To me, that sounds mortifying."

SlutJustice,3c4ruu,warsie,3,Thu Jul 9 04:00:33 2015 UTC,"*edit* replied to the wrong post  Of course, but it's my view that the civil rights movement and integration were necessary precursors to the so called war on drugs. I believe that the New Jim Crow, as some have dubbed it, is the logical result making blacks equal in the eyes of the law. There are many other factors at work in causing a higher black incarceration rate, but I think civil rights were a necessary condition.   The analogy with the spate of female teachers being arrested for sexual misconduct with students is that before feminism and before statutory rape laws were amended to cover males, this type of ""crime"" would be outright ignored by police officers and prosecutors. I think teacher-student sex is happening more in part due to technology, children having cell phones and social media, but nevertheless I think a generation or two ago this type of thing would have been swept under the carpet by the responsible authorities.   Similarly, in the segregation/pre-civil rights era, I believe that a lot of the petty crimes that blacks are incarcerated for committing would either not have been enforced or handled within the black community without the involvement of law enforcement. I think the extremely pervasive state presence in the black community, e.g., parole officers, social services, police patrols, stop-and-frisk, are the wages of ""civil rights.""   Now, I can't prove all of this definitively because we can never know what would have happened had history been different. And there are of course other variables. But my theory is that, if we examine the historical record, we will find that contrary to popular wisdom, authorities in the pre-civil rights era had a much more laissez-faire attitude toward law enforcement in the black community."

SlutJustice,3c4ruu,Seany_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:54:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm thinking about doing research and writing an essay related to this topic. I think there's probably a good argument that the average black person had more ""freedom"" in the pre-civil rights era. There's no doubt that black elites have benefited enormously from civil rights, but the black community as a whole has suffered in many ways. Black families, I think, were also disproportionately harmed by the sexual revolution."
SlutJustice,3c4ruu,warsie,2,Tue Jul 14 03:47:46 2015 UTC,"Read the writings of black nationalists on how integration was shitty. Malcolm X wrote about it, and the Black Panthers wrote some thigns also. Also, there was 'desegregation as a cold war imperative' which mentions desegregation was a cold was concept http://www.jstor.org/stable/1228836?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents  The black bourgoeise benefiting the most from civil rights reforms is also true as they could integrate their own resources into the white american economy and the rest of the empire it maintains. They just fucked over their proletarians in the process, but to be fair the capitalist changes by white american capitalists did most of that (deindustrialization and automation).  The Autobiography of Malcolm X mentions a little of that This book has chapters on how integraton meant in cases blacks schools were shut down and black teachers fired, even though to be fair part of that was because blacks had the shittiest schools http://www.amazon.com/Country-Strangers-Blacks-Whites-America/dp/0679734546  I won't tough the 'sexual revolution' thing with a 10 foot pole. not just for the reactionary implications, but this: Let me explain: when whites were openly homophobic and had raids on gay bars and whatnot, blacks were more lukewarm and not caring about relatives being gay. Harlem in 1920s had a lot of gays and crossdressers. Furthermore, African peoples had a different culture and sexual outlook (ranging from islamist oppression, to open sexuality somewhat similar to current day).   You could argue that given aspect of ""pick up artistry"" first came up among black people, that they adjusted relatively well given they were in the shittiest position and had to require 'street smarts', at least some blacks who were able to orally transmit this knowledge to other people. But im not a PUA or aligned necessarily with that faction to count that with a grian of salt (Malcolm X mentions a little in his autobiography how pimps selected certain people as good possible prostitutes by how they danced, as well as a lot of stuff on 1940s NYC underground hustlers and stuff in his autobiography.

Yes, and I don't suppose I need to ask if you actually believe girls are precious little innocent flowers and boys are sex monsters.  If anything I think girls are less victimized when they have sex with an adult authority figure because they crave men with status.  They are hard-wired to fuck their teachers and anyone else with relative  status and power.    The prosecutors stress this precisely because it's not true in a real world sense, only in the eyes of the law.    You're reaching really far for that one.  They stress that the negative effects of a trusted adult supervisor abusing their power in order to benefit sexually from underage children is consistent between genders.     A new female teacher is arrested and publicly humiliated for this crime literally every single week in America.    I don't believe this.

I suppose you're the sort of guy who would feel no shame in prostituting his own wife and daughters as long as they're up for it.   My view has absolutely nothing to do with girls being ""precious little innocent flowers"" or boys being ""sex monsters.""   I simply view female chastity as inherently more valuable than male chastity and therefore worthy of more protection. I thought this was something people understood, which is why I have a hard time believing you were being honest in your idiotically cynical reply to my question.    Do you really see no value in protecting female chastity? Put differently, would you be no more protective of a daughter than a son?   They stress that the negative effects of a trusted adult supervisor abusing their power in order to benefit sexually from underage children is consistent between genders.   Please explain the negative effects on a 17-year-old boy of having sex with a teacher. How is he harmed exactly?  Wouldn't having sex with a teacher increase the ""status and power"" of the 17-year-old boy?  __  I also believe that women, who are generally weaker, more emotional and childlike compared to men, tend to be less culpable for their crimes. But I view that as more or less debatable. The fact that a minor female's chastity is more valuable than a male's is a given, or so I thought....."

SlutJustice,3b2t7n,BustaHymes,13,Thu Jun 25 14:44:29 2015 UTC,"180 post. You get it. Sluts are feral women, and shaming men for slutting is pointless because they have an innately different attitude toward sex (which all the liberal social engineering in the world won't change).   Now don't get me wrong, they aren't beyond help, they aren't worthless, they deserve in fact to be treated like ladies so that hopefully they realize and act in a way that they should as ladies. Unfortunately it's too late for many.   It turns out this is a very controversial opinion. A couple of sluts featured in this sub have been granted leniency, and that hasn't gone over well with the hardline slut-shamers (who are of course welcome here, and welcome to criticize sluts and leniency as they see fit).  Because of my enthusiastic criticism of sluts, it surprised people when I backed off of girls whose slutting was undeniable, just because they'd seen the error of their ways. But that really is a big deal! Maybe 20 years ago it wasn't, but these millennial girls are so lost, so poisoned by modernity, I'm amazed when they manage to pull themselves out of the fog. Most of them will be in it until they hit ""the wall"" (and many beyond that point).   The children of today will grow up to be even bigger, more miserable sluts if something doesn't change. There are already people telling girls ""These feminist whores are LYING to you,"" but it will be more effective if some of them finish that with ""...and I speak from experience.""  I don't hold out much hope for most sluts. I just want to use them as examples. And I think that the rare slut who defects over to the anti-slut side can be a particularly effective example."
SlutJustice,3b2t7n,2PantsLady,7,Thu Jun 25 17:32:21 2015 UTC,"I think I phrased that badly. What I mean, I think, is that you should speak harshly and firmly to sluts - but without treating them like dogs even if this is how they treat themselves. I mean, they should be shamed and feel shameful. What I don't condone is when people say things like, ""Just kill yourself already"" or other similar things. So treat them as you would treat a lady who was doing bad things. Harshly, firmly, perhaps even shockingly but also reassuringly making them understand that the reason you are shaming them is because they were made for so much more and have the chance to pull themselves up by the socks and be somebody different.  If you're critical of someone just to tell them to die in an oven, there's a bit of cognitive dissonance there on behalf of the accuser - if you didn't care and really wished them death they'd be of no concern to you (like, when did noblemen ever get involved in the intriciate politics of the peasants? It was below them, they don't care, fuck 'em). I think even the most hardcore of shamers here only want what is best for women. I certainly do. There are a few twisted minds though who genuinely hate women and sluts (think of the Elliot Rodgers type; beta fags who can't get women so they slut shame out of jealousy rather than out of disgust for degeneracy). Without slut shaming, just like without reactionaries towards fags and other libtard shit, the voice of reason and history would be drowned out."

SlutJustice,3b2t7n,Inquisitor1,2,Thu Jun 25 17:49:50 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  I've said this before on this sub, too.  We slut-shame because we love.  Sluttery leads to STDs, stunted emotional growth, spinsterism.  Sluttery leads women into a position where they, often forced by the man they're fucking, end up literally killing their innocent children.  I slut-shame because I love girls and women.   Someone who tells an alcoholic to get help doesn't hate them.   The guy handing him the bottle does."

You can have a great married sex life"

It's definitely not ideal, and I wouldn't marry one. They are permanently damaged in many ways.  Consequences are a part of living and making choices. But they are consequences not death sentences. I am not hand waving anything, if you feel that sluts are too damaged for you and the soul means nothing, whatever, disagree all you like.

SlutJustice,3b2t7n,pig_n_a_poke,2,Thu Jun 25 18:19:13 2015 UTC,Do you believe sluts can become good women?
SlutJustice,3b2t7n,Inquisitor1,2,Mon Jun 29 15:43:43 2015 UTC,"Yes. One could be an ex-prostitute and leave that life and live as a hermit next to a convent for 30 years in prayer and helping the poor and needy. Nobody would know that you were a prostitute before hand; they'd even be really surprised to hear it probably.   On a less extreme level, one could be the type of person to have slept around (say, upwards of 5 men but not over 10) and reform relatively quickly. She'll have baggage and some damage from that, but as long as she's aware of this and as long as she isn't the type to demand things (like, ""Now that I'm good I demand a virgin husband, and a rich one"") then its okay. Not ideal though.  More extreme sluttery though requires more penance and hard work to over come. Girls who've been gang banged and one night stands with 30 guys before reaching the age of 25 - they can be good women, but in my opinion they shouldn't marry, they need to be celibate and pray and do things like help the poor in their free time or whatever.   I differentiate between the psychological and the soul. A good person is one who has confessed their sins and lives virtuously according to the precepts of the Church (commandments, Canon law, etc). Once you fix your dirty soul you can be a good person, but this doesn't mean you have the capacity to be a good wife, a good mother etc.  I see myself as example. I've had 2 sexual partners, one of which was a one night stand the other a long term girlfriend. I've fiddled around with maybe 5 other girls (heavy petting, clothes on kinda stuff). This was when I wasn't Catholic and I was a liberal, but I still hated sexual degeneracy so I thought at the time I was super conservative. Anyway, right now I haven't dated in 5 years or kissed a girl or even fapped. I'm committed to chastity until marriage. I don't think I'm too emotionally fucked to be a good father. I totally regret that past degeneracy though and I work on making myself better in that respect. Though I don't think I was a ""slut"" which means I won't marry a slut. I'll only marry a girl with similar experiences, give or take one or two. I can't demand a virgin because I'm not one, but I'll never marry a chick who has been in a gang bang, or sodomized, or had more than one or two one night stands or those types who think sucking off guys doesn't count so they do it without regard. I have in fact been rejected by girls for not being a virgin and I am completely okay with that. Why should they have waited so many years in patience to share something with their husband only for him to have not given a fuck? So yes I've been disappointed, but I am okay with it, and I encourage it. I probably get away with more than I should because I am good looking and charming. But I'm open about it when it comes up.  Though, of course, it is different for men and women but I still maintain an element of realism and trying to not be a hypocrite. I'd rather remain celibate my entire life than marry someone who has been totally defiled. Obviously its black and white and not on a scale (you're either a virgin or not) so perhaps one could ask what's the difference between 3 guys and 30. But I think mentally and emotionally there's a huge difference, even if technically non-virgin is non-virgin.  So, yes, sluts can become good women. They have to work hard though, and if my religious suggestions don't suit, at least they should spend a long time self-reforming before attempting to date a good man with the intention to marry. I'm talking 3-5 years of self improvement and reforming ones view of sex, intimacy, family values, etc. A chick who wakes up and realizes that 30 cocks inside her wasn't a great idea won't just suddenly transform into a good woman. She needs treatment for the disease she has (the POZ cultural marxist trash in her head). My suggested treatment is the Church because I think that's the only real solution at all (and the only long term one, speaking of the afterlife too). But if she's opposed to that; she can at least appropriate Christian values of her ancestors with things like modesty, purity, chastity, the role of women in society, etc. Just don't expect that this women is good marriage material even if she has been reformed. She's defiled, it's a simple fact, and should be grateful to find a man to marry. Usually they'll find a man of similar background; some reformed criminal or something and they are both past child bearing years so they get married for the company etc."

I think you should date a girl sometime soon though, is dating permitted in Catholicism? I dated before I married but I never had sexual contact. I started dating (not in a relationship, just romantically dating) my husband when I was 14 and he was 19 on and off for a while, and during this time he slept around. For a few years I witnessed him become less and less happy and be destroyed by the life of promiscuity. We started dating again and he expressed his desire to live a pure life with a family and children. I made him wait till marriage totally chaste, not even kissing me until we could become intimate.    He's a total alpha male, everything you'd want in a husband. Handsome, economically successful, traditional, dominant, loving, protrctve, good genes. I'm glad I married him but I do wish he never slept around like that because it made him so unhappy, and I'm glad that he has a woman who will treat how how a patriarch deserves to be treated. It's not like I don't rely on him either, being held in his arms and being safe and owned is such a great feeling."
SlutJustice,3b2t7n,Inquisitor1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:44:17 2015 UTC,"I always love hearing what you have to say from a Catholic perspective.   Well I'm posting my own mixture of things here - as I say, from a purely theological perspective, which is the most important, confession and the desire to lead a good life is all that is necessary to be good and reformed. The soul is what counts. But again that doesn't mean there aren't consequences for the world right now - emotional baggage, psychological damage, etc. Though I do believe in the power of grace, so perhaps I am wrong in saying an ex-prostitute can't be a good mother. God works miracles all the time, He could heal that womans mind and emotions and make her a good mother. But I think it's rare.   I think you should date a girl sometime soon though, is dating permitted in Catholicism?   Yes of course, but traditional Catholicism (I am aligned with a very conservative Catholicism, look up the SSPX) tries to label it as ""courting"". I see no need for the difference language aside from making it clear that we don't mean dating in the sense of - hey lets have sex, live together, etc. So we mean traditional dating - basically friendship, and if there is attraction you see if you're compatible for marriage and that kinda thing. I only haven't dated because I was in a monastery for 2 years, and since then I haven't met any Catholic women (yes I tried online dating, most Catholic women are in America). It's difficult for me being attractive too (not to be arrogant about it, just the reality that I expect to marry someone of equal good looks which means my pool is tiny).  I'm happy you taught your husband the value of purity and chastity, and glad you waited. It's extremely rare in this world for a woman to do that, especially since you have no religious reason to do so. Commendable. And you illustrate a point I was trying to make in the OP - when women give out sex, men just take which is why it's important for women to be chaste because they lead men in this regard - they have to ""teach"" men about purity and chastity and the value of these things. When women degrade, men are happy to take the opportunity to be degenerate. But if women raise the standard and say, ""no, you have to work to have me"" they place value on themselves that is priceless, and this ignites in men a sort of passion for virtue where they realize ""Hey wait a minute, I was made to be the king of my passions, they shouldn't rule me, I am the boss here""."
SlutJustice,3b2t7n,Sheboonery,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:53:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think I'm as virtuous as you think, I always did do it for myself. I viewed the boys I rejected for wanting sex as wanting to defile me and ruin my chances of a high quality man and thus as bad. I did it in a self interest of wanting a patriarchal husband. I just saw how gender relations worked from a young age, the natural urge of men toward an untouched virgin wife. I only wanted one man in my life, whoever I ended up marrying. These days I keep with that. I'm only permitted to talk to other men when my husband is present.    I'm sorry if I'm rambling on I just really love gender roles. The innate tender love between a man and a woman. Do you ever plan on having kids? I don't use birth control, my husband and I have a very large house capable of accommodating around 10 kids and we both want a big family. I'm also home 24/7 so we can make it work.    I think having children is essential to marriage, there's something so intimate about being pregnant, it marks a girl physically as belonging to her husband which I love. It feels so freeing to let go of control and your husband is there to protect you. Being pregnant and held in his arms is the best feeling in the world."
SlutJustice,3b2t7n,SoullessTechnocrat,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:14:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think I'm as virtuous as you think,   Well, whatever your motives it all stems from what Catholicism/Aristotle called the ""natural law"" which is imprinted (by God) into our souls. It manifested itself in you in a way that made you not want men to defile you. That's totally legitimate; you understood the natural law (even though not perfectly). You might not have had supernatural virtue where a lady says, ""I will stay a virgin for it is holy"") but you had natural virtue.   Do you ever plan on having kids?   Since Catholicism doesn't permit the use of contraception, I assume that if I get married I'll have as many kids as God intends unless I am barren or something. The function of marriage is the creation and education of children for the kingdom of God, so like you I'll be having children.  You're fortunate to be able to support loads of kids! I'm 25 now and had to move back in with my parents because rent took 70% of my salary and I couldn't really afford to do anything else once my shit car started having issues etc. I wasn't paycheck to paycheck fortunately but I found it incredibly stupid to spend so much on rent when my millionare parents had 5 of their 6 rooms free. But I had to plead with them to move in since they have plans to travel (both retired at 50). So I have to move in with my sister soon to save on rent. For that reason alone until I somehow find a ton of money I don't see myself getting married within the next 5 years which kinda sucks but I trust in God's plan whatever that may be."

SlutJustice,3antzu,benmarvin,-13,Mon Jun 22 01:30:37 2015 UTC,What's the word for a guy who gives dick out like free candy?
SlutJustice,3antzu,Lv99_BixNood,16,Mon Jun 22 01:43:25 2015 UTC,"This statement betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the male-female relationship dynamic.  A woman is the gatekeeper of sex, not a man. A woman can give away sex like ""free candy"" and men will line up for their piece, but securing commitment of resources should be her goal. A man has the resources but wants sex (Or at least he should have resources, and again the dynamic places the onus on the woman to make sure he does.)  Biologically, what does a woman gain by giving away sex to men without any commitment? (Aside from a few minutes of fleeting pleasure.) She can only have one man's child at a time. And because that is the case it is foolish to have sex with ten different men. She will have made herself unappealing for anything other than sex - no man can count on any children she has being his own, and therefore will have no reason to commit. She will have one child, be unable to determine the father, and unable to secure the aid of the father or any other man. In nature, without a welfare state this means she and her baby would starve to death.  But hey, at least she had fun rubbing genitals, right?  Conversely a man who has sex with many women can have many children whether he commits to them or not. A man in that same scenario could have ten different children, and if he has the resources he might even be able to support several or all of them, which assuming exclusivity is a win for both the female and male. Of course, other men might feel differently.. which is why civilization came up with the compromise of having only one spouse for both men and women (To avoid constant highlander-like internecine tribal murder contests.)  Put another way, women have to be choosy. They have to select the best possible mate to have a child with. Anything after that is superfluous, unless maybe she is capable of securing commitment from multiple men. This is an extremely risky strategy however as if it was done secretly and the men find out she might end up with none. If it's not a secret it is unlikely she'd be able to hook the best type of man with this strategy as any decent man would tell her to take a hike. They'll take sex with her, yes, but commit to her? Nope. Men however don't need to mate with only the best women. It's preferable from a societal standpoint to be sure, but biologically speaking a man loses nothing by having sex with the best and also the second and third best.  Therefore women who fail their role of filtering out the duds are sluts, and men who are able to acquire access to a large number of females are studs.  Of course this isn't ""fair"" in the modern sense so instead to avoid hurting their feelings we tell girls they should use the male strategy (Even though it will ruin their lives.)  And if you think you can put aside feelings that are the result of millions of years of evolution because birth control has made sex ""harmless fun,"" think again. You are not smarter than biology. If you work in concert with these principles, you will be happy. Work against them at your own peril. If you look around at the ways modern civilization subverts these, you invariably find broken homes and miserable people, men and women."

Women stay at home to bring up children and take care of the home. Both necessary jobs, both hard jobs, both have their own struggles, skills and sacrifices. The role of the husband as leader is not to be Chairman Pao and rule with an iron fist; nor to be an island and just make decisions on his own for his own reasons. He must be like Christ; sacrificing his own desires for the good of his family, and doing all he can to make his wife and children comfortable, which is why he is the leader. Similarly, women need to understand the importance of bringing up their children - educating them in all the necessary things and to keep the house in a state good enough that her husband doesn't have to think of cleaning as his second job. The women is master of the inside realm; the man of the outside realm (in a manner of speaking). That's basically what the marriage contract has at its core - I give you myself, you give me yourself, and we do all this for the sake of bringing up a good set of kids.   I don't think women should work if there are children under the age of 18 at home unless in dire circumstances (this implying that children are to be homeschooled... I'd never send my kids to a public school in this day and age). This talk given by a Priest has some good thoughts on Women/Men and what has gone wrong etc."

You could have just answered my question and explained how you would get your kid to interact with others (apart from you) and develop social skills. Social skills are not textbook skills, you need to learn them by your day to day activities. If your lifestyle doesn't require social skills, you won't develop them, simple. So how will you bring the need for interaction to their lives? I'm not attacking you at all, I just want to know how you will raise homeschooled kids as it's mostly unheard of where I live."

Im not saying homeschooling cant achieve this but the majoritry of HS kids are somewhat out of touch and sheltered..  My opinion is based on the lack of  social skills, not education.  Your kid needs to know how to handle bullies, arguments, relationships, etc.. some things just cant be simulated and mommy and daddy just cant teach"
SlutJustice,3ajiks,reactionaryCookie,2,Tue Jun 23 13:35:04 2015 UTC,"I've found the opposite.  For one, home-schooled kids get more teacher-student attention, and can learn more in 4 hours because of this than a public school student can in 16.   This gives them more time for extracurricular pursuits.   I'm not going to pretend I've never met ""eccentric"" or autistic homeschooled kids before - we all have.  But most are prodigious athletes, scholars, and artists, and totally 'normal.'"

That's actually what happens when you realize you are completely worthless for anything other than letting dirtbags like your boyfriends defile you, and that you'll never have a family because no decent man would EVER marry a ragged out whore such as yourself.  I'd be lying if I didn't admit that you rival any slut ever featured in this sub. You actually pulled a train (Five Guys, like the burger joint), which is the pinnacle of slutting achievements. I bet the majority of sluts who have done that were paid whores, but you did it for free! Do you have any idea how few women would allow themselves to be defiled like that? Even in the degenerate society we live in, most sluts draw the line WAY before that. That's every bit as nasty as the fact that you got literally pissed and shat on by your dirtbag boyfriend.  Think about the shame you've brought on your family. Your godmother paid for your university so you could learn something useful, not so you could destroy your life by becoming some whips & chains BDSM whore. How do you think she'd feel knowing what a disgusting cumrag you turned into at school?  I can't help but despise someone who would so thoroughly disgrace their own family for perverted sexual hedonism.  And as for your boyfriend, piece of shit that he is, telling people you did that shit because you wanted to: WHO CARES? That you did it AT ALL is the real issue. You did things by choice that some women would rather die than do. You let these degenerates defile you in ways I don't even want to imagine, FOR WHAT? So they could dump loads in you?  You might have ""survived"" in that you're still alive, but any sanctity, decency, and dignity you may have once had is GONE, and it's gone forever. What type of total loser could ever hold you sacred, when you let other men use you as as some kind of toilet-Fleshlight? If you ever have children, what would it do to them to learn about the things you've done? Hell, I'm sickened that I live on the same planet as you.  I know you only posted in /r/relationships so you could get sympathy and play the victim, but you did all this shit to yourself. You seek out these depraved boyfriends, who consider you a fuck hole, and rather than run for the hills like any decent woman would, you let one use you until you couldn't take it any more. Even the degenerates consoling you wouldn't ever marry you unless they were really desperate. You are going to be used as a semen receptacle scummy guys until your looks have faded, and then you are going to be very, very lonely.

A man's desire to do violence can be virtuous if applied in the right way, for the right reasons (defense of home, lands, innocents, his family, etc.)  A woman's desire to breed is a beautiful and virtuous thing.  /u/bdsurvivor's life is not, and she's taken something beautiful and made it filthy.   This isn't about ""moral panic,"" it's about someone literally destroying and undermining our society.  The economic and social costs of sluts are astounding.  The amount of people that die at the hands of boys raised by sluts is astouding.  Bin Laden, the Super Tsarnaev Bros. and Timothy McVeigh wish they could do as much damage as a troop of sluts, but they never could.   We dropped an a-bomb on Hiroshima.  Compare it to Detroit now.

They claim they don't care what women think of them, but base their entire self-worth on their ability to get women to spread their legs for them. And the truly ironic part is that slut culture is literally the only reason that the lifestyle they enjoy (or in many cases don't enjoy personally, but idolize) is even possible. In a non-degenerate culture, you couldn't just walk into a club and come home with a different girl every night no matter how much ""SMV"" you had. Hell, such places wouldn't even exist.

Those traits often lead to defeatist thinking, but do not have to.   Not to mention the 'muh Asian girls' circlejerk   We're agreed on that one, though it's more of a ""muh traditional culture"" than Asian girls specifically, it just so happens that Asian girls usually come from very similar cultures to the one espoused as ideal by the right wing of western politics. If TRP could find western girls with traditional values in similar amounts, it would probably drop the ""Asian girls"" thing."

I'm religious, so I obviously am opposed to male sluttery on those grounds.  However, it's generally not as problematic from a purely secular stand-point.   The main reason men should avoid sluttery is to set an example for women and to encourage them, metaphysical reasons aside."

I think it's good to read the opinions of people on this sub and see how they may differ from my own.   Everyone is welcome here.  I can't guarantee you won't get downvoted, but the mods generally don't censor, like I said.  (But, with the brigade, most of my posts here are downvoted below 0 so it's not like even that matters.)   I still view promiscuity as being equal for both genders. I'm not a feminist, but I like to try keep things as equal as possible for men and women.   I sort of agree.  Again, I'm religious, so I believe that men and women are intrinsically equal, and that this should translate into other forms of equality (or, perhaps the better word to use would be equity) such as legal equality.     But I don't believe men and women are ""the same.""  I'd say rather we are complementary, with different strengths and weaknesses.   Part of those complementary differences means that sleeping around is more dangerous, to herself and those around her, for a woman than it is a man.   Contraception, abortion, and women entering the full-time workforce and advanced careers have alleviated some of those dangers, but not all.  The feminization of poverty is a prime example of this, and it exists due primarily to sluttery (I'll concede there are often other factors at play as well, but the amount of married, poor women is very, very low.)  I think slut-shaming benefits women.  In the past, indeed, it was women who primarily slut-shamed.  Think about it: If you're a woman who marries a man, has 5 kids with him, and depend on him financially (as well as, of course, love him), you don't want some 20 year old batting her eyelashes at him when you're 40.  The modern answer to this is, ""But I trust him!""  Which is good, but eventually things happen, mistakes are made, and the moral fabric declines.  It is much easier to be the 7th guy on your block to cheat on your wife than the first; it is much easier to turn down a slut one time than it is one-hundred times, etc.  Divorce is unthinkable if no one in your family has ever done it, but steadily becomes more of an option with each passing occurrence.  Slut-shaming was a way for women to protect themselves, their children, and their communities.    Obviously, in this sub, some people crank it up to 11 for comedic effect.  Some may even be ""trolling.""  Some may indeed be misogynists or even misanthropes (and truly be those, not just called those by tumblristas.)   But most of the men and women on this sub are here because we really, genuinely lament the decay of morals that has done serious damage on both a societal and individual scale."

I'm not a mod or leader of the sub or anything, but the team is incredibly hands-off.     It would be great to discourage that behaviour in both sexes.   Definitely!  Again, though, the danger is greater for women.  Women ""peak"" earlier than men, generally.  Other than fetishizing ""MILFs"" (and even then, the name itself is indicative of the respect shown and the entire intent of the 'relationship'), older women aren't as desirable, sexually or otherwise, as older men are, which is why pair-bonding and slut-shaming, as well as children as a unitive, shared responsibility, are so important for women and marriages and society in general.   All feminism has done for women has taken away a man's incentives to stick around with her when he is at his sexual, physical, and financial peak and she is beginning menopause."

That is defined by    Sex positivity (it helps you determine if they're sluts, because most women hide their actual counts. And it also helps gets rid of what TRP calls ""slutshield"" in seduction. i.e. where women feign innocence and end up delaying sex) ""Leave them better than you found them""  Do not wife sluts. Or get into relationships with them.    Other than that, I love sluts. They make up the bulk of the women I sleep with. But I cannot deny with a straight face that the entire modern discourse completely brushes under the rug scientific consensus that a woman with a high partner count is a drastically poorer choice for LTR than a woman who is not a slut. And they also brush under the rug that she is likely to lie to you about that and not let you make up your own mind about whether you want to be with her or not. And lastly, I find it offensive that if I do find out, I am shamed for making a rational choice in determining her as worthless for wife or mother material. At least for me.  I hate on sluts(or at least use the word and offensive language Like ""worthless"") as an exercise in polemics. I find it offensive that every other type of personal history is up for judgment but a person who prefers not to be in a relationship with promiscuous women is going to be shamed and mocked for it.

And how did it get me a loving girlfriend? I was a social retard, game taught me how to get girls and boosted my confidence to great heights. I deal with less bullshit in my life and demand more respect from the people i interact with. People are too quick to say its bullshit but i guarantee if i took you out on the field a few times and gave you the tips you need you'd be pulling strange girls within 2 weeks.   Suggesting that western men should marry Asian women   Oh no people want to get married to someone they care about what a fucking tragedy.    be gay   ROK, run by rooshv (one of the most well known promoters of game/trp), actively bans gays. Dude you really have no idea what you're talking about.   or live a life of fucking loose whores and die unmarried bitter childless old men are all oven worthy.    I plan on settling down, just never marrying her. The legal is just too fucked up to allow it. This isn't just me or PUA either, men avoiding marriage is happening everywhere. South korea, japan, china, india, US, UK, spain...  you can get many more examples in a google search by you dont even do that. Amazingly your cynicism of trp is the exact same one you accuse us of having over women.   Your cynicism about Western woMEN   See what i did there? With your own words? Fucking lol. I love exposing hypocrites and ignorant idiots.   is over the top, maybe you guys would attract chaste women if you cared more about starting a family than making your peepees feel good.   Go watch Divorce Corp (solarmovie.is will have it for streaming) and find out why in not marrying. You've also made a pretty large assumption, i have a girlfriend that i love very much, shes extremely attractive, cooks every meal, cleans my apartment, lives with me, sexually satisfies me and she loves me so much as well that we're near inseparable. Its cynicism of western women that actually pushed me to her. After no success in finding a woman with enough decency to say no to sex on the first date (as in unable to say no to a stranger shes known for under 5 hours) i began to filter women out BY COUNTRY and i found my girlfriend from ukraine in about 2 weeks after i applied the filter. Western women aren't worth the ground i piss on and that judgment is made solely from my experiences. When i only get 2 or 3 rejections a year i know that there simply is nothing for me to look for here and i feel its a shame, but i won't settle for shit after all the work ive put into myself.   I will never shame you guys for fucking whores, guys don't generally feel any shame about it.   Because its fucking hard to be a stud. Almost no guy can get girls like i can. Its terribly easy to be a slut though as any woman can stsnd on a bar table and scream ""Just got dumped and need some dick!"" And she'll find some men willing and able. Why would you respect someone who takes such an easy way out and cares so little about sex? Its much more than a genital massage. I could see the love in my girls eyes when i popped her cherry, its a look no slut will give you.    I will point and laugh at you guys when you cry about all women being sluts though.   I dont really care, i just wont marry or date you. I coms here to read the xposts and laugh my ass off. I am disappointed in the state of things today, i never expected to have to look outside my country, to be unable to marry. I dreamed about that shit as a kid, what my wife would look like, how happy we'd be together, its sad that reality is the polar opposite but i will adapt instead of cry over it. Believe me, i lose zero sleep over sluts being sluts.   You guys are just encouraging their behavior when we could be putting women in their place by treating these whores like the untouchable filth they are.   Encouraging it? Oh so you think the media, schools, government, most people in general, etc. Have less impact than a small bunch of guys saying ""lolno fuck that.""? You're delusional kid."

I never post at trp because i know the avg reddittor is a fat neckbeard loser and a bunch faggots fucking sluts think they're hot shit. Theres a few guys who have their shit down but im not one to wade through the bullshit. Like i said, I'm here to laugh at whores being dumb whores.   I have an ugly loser acquaintance who fucks different women every week just because he uses Tinder. It doesn't impress me.   He fucks SLUTS. Dude how have you not thought literally 1 step further? Do you just say shit without thinking about it? And if hes ugly i highly doubt hes fucking women that I'd even LOOK at, let alone talk to.   Implying TRP autists give a shit about the slant eyed gook whores they marry.   Implying because someone is trp they hate every single woman alive. See, i can play this game too and frankly you suck at it. No offense and the shittiest defense.   You know what is a fucking tragedy? Pathetic Hapa manlets like Eliott Rodger going on killing sprees because his dad cared more about pussy than family.    Lolwut? If Elliott Rodger had gotten laid he wouldn't have done it. This is even in his manifesto, he clearly stated that if one girl had given him a chance he wouldn't have done it. Dont talk about shit you have no clue on, especially when his book is on the internet for free. Great job exposing yourself as the retard you are though.   This is because modern men are pussies who consume estrogen mimickers on a daily basis and don't know how to keep a woman in line.    So if i dont wanna risk my children and half my paychecks for 18 years its because i cant keep my woman in line and not because i gain nothing from marriage that i dont get from cohabitation? You really are fucking retarded and your false masculine bravado is so very clearly faked. No wonder you're marrying, you're locking down the only girl you're ever gonna get.   Come to a rural area where we get our food from the earth around us instead of plastic bags.   I grew a garden back at my parents home when i was younger. When I'm older and move into a home i plan on starting my own. What does gardening have to do with being a man either? Ive met many rednecks who were just as pussyfooted around women as i was before i learned game. All talk and no bite, at least the whore before you was remotely entertaining, this is just a sad and pathetic takedown.   Men still act like men and women still act like women.   In the US? I highly doubt that.    I've never feared my wife leaving me or doing anything with another guy   Im not one for backwood inbred women. You dont fear your wife leaving or cheating but you sure are asspained over an online comment. And ive seen that you lie to make a point so i highly doubt this is true. Stop posturing and get off the high horse. Deal with the banter or get the fuck out.   It's just so ironic how you start this post off bragging about getting strange pussy and end up complaining about whores who want nothing but strange dick.   Complaining? How is ""lol i dont give a shit"" complaining? I'm dying to see the mental gymnastics.   Do you not see the hypocrisy?    No, double standard exists for a reason and frankly why didn't you try to dispute that and go straight to shaming here? Because you can't dispute it.   I agree there is something fucked up about most Western women, I just don't think western men are much better.    I never said western men are much better, dont put words in my mouth you cunt.   I'm glad you guys adapt, I wish you would focus more on Western women though.   Why would i want to better a slut? I can sell my fellow man pick up lessons and profit, i cant marry a slut no matter how ""reformed"" she might be.   Most that I've met are great and the things you say about them don't apply at all. I have a feeling that most of you guys live in urban areas and the things you say are more applicable there, but I just can't relate to that lifestyle whatsoever.    So you talk shit about something you know literally nothing about? And you admit to knowing fuck all about it? Why even post at that point?   You guys may just be a raindrop in an ocean, but engaging in the hookup culture indeed encourages its existence.   The reality is i can either go celibate to not be that raindrop or i cab realize ""hey this ocean is not drying out anytime soon and its not gonna be potable anytime soon either, might as well enjoy the decline and find a fresh stream later down the road elsewhere."" You have to offer me something to make me want to go, without that then i simply will not do so. Sluts offer free se for no commitment? Fine ill take it. Sluts want commitment? I'm out. Good girl  wants commitment? If i can get hard for you its happening. That simple. When i only find 2 or 3 good girls a year the fact is i dont care if the ocean grows and grows, russia is still keeping their women fresh instead of salty and ive started learning that language already. Fuck you and your ""man up and marry that slut"" bullshit."

""The reality is that men and women have inherent biological differences. This is the first agreed upon community belief of Return of Kings.

Catering to gays and women would require fundamentally changing Return of Kings in such a drastic way that it would no longer fulfill the needs of straight heterosexual men, and alienate men from the space they created. Just as I wouldn’t enter a women’s group or a gay club and demand they make chances to accommodate my needs as a straight man, I expect that women and gays wouldn’t enter male-only spaces and demand they change to accommodate the needs of women and gays, yet that is precisely what has happened in every historical male space that has been socially integrated.""  http://www.returnofkings.com/31620/why-women-and-gays-should-not-be-allowed-in-male-safe-spaces   I'm totally confused about this point?

You're right, it's pretty easy for me to get laid, doesn't make it any less fun. As to the way your girlfriend looks at you, of course I'm not going to fall in love with some guy just because he's sleeping with me. I expect more than that in a partner. I may sleep around but I don't hand out my love freely. I have been in a monogamous relationship for four months now. I probably would have slept with him on the first date if he tried (turns out he only slept with one person before we met so he was nervous) but after four months I still will not say that I love him, even though he has said it to me. I'm on that path with him but I'm not ready for that step. Sex is easy, you can have sex with anyone just for fun. You can't do that with love.

While all guys can walk, not all guys can get laid like a slut. Your logical fallacy: false equivalency.    They don't do that because it's fucking stupid.    If you REALLY believe we're going up to sluts in public and shouting ""OMG YOU'RE SUCH A WHORE FUCKING SLUT ENJOY UR 50 DICKS CUNT"" then you are 100% delusional. Let me guess, you think racists still spend their time under sheets setting crosses on fire dont you?    You're right, it's pretty easy for me to get laid, doesn't make it any less fun.    But statistically it does make you a shittier partner than my virgin gf. And with that in mind im simply just going to fuck you and not date you. I have high standards, maybe you should look into raising your own.   As to the way your girlfriend looks at you, of course I'm not going to fall in love with some guy just because he's sleeping with me.    But no guy will look into your eyes and see your attachment to him grow. She didn't fall in love because of that but i knew that she would that very moment. Thats something you will never be able to provide for your man anymore as sex is more of a genital massage to you now than it is something held in high regards. I love how you've proven my point.    I expect more than that in a partner. I may sleep around but I don't hand out my love freely.   You expect more from a partner but sleep around? How do you even successfully judge a partner if you sleep around because odds are they're lying to get into your pants? This makes no sense. You also assume this is what made her love me and not the fact that PUA/TRP works. Your very own post is proof of how damaged your concept of sex and love are and here you are asking why whoring around is bad. Take a look in the mirror.   I have been in a monogamous relationship for four months now.   Poor guy.   I probably would have slept with him on the first date if he tried (turns out he only slept with one person before we met so he was nervous)    So thats why hes your boyfriend, he can't get laid and settled for a slut. You keep proving my point for me, why are you even trying to argue? You dont have to defend your whoring around, just don't expect to get a good man.   but after four months I still will not say that I love him, even though he has said it to me.   Of course not, you're not attracted to him like you are to the badboys you fucked so easily. He is desperate and unable to do better so of course he loves you so soon, he has nothing better to go for. He dumps you and he has MONTHS if not YEARS of being sexless. He is not a good man, hes a fucking pussy and you know it.   I'm on that path with him but I'm not ready for that step.   Difference is i lead and she follows, here it seems you lead and he follows. This wobt last very long.   Sex is easy, you can have sex with anyone just for fun. You can't do that with love.   Oh noes i have to be a decent human being to the person i love what a fucking tragedy. Im so sorry this is how you feel, and mostly im sorry for your future husband because hes gonna wanna kill himself when you do cheat on him. You will, your words here imply that very well.    It seems to me people confuse the two simply because sex is better when it is with someone you love.   Not really, depends on too many variables. The reality is though by simply reading your post and looking at your views that in no way would men of a higher caliber date you. Why? Because better girls with a more stable outlook on sex and relationships are there for us to take and between a weak horse and strong horse, i will ride the strong horse every time."

Oh and another fact you can look up,  women in general are less happy than they were 40 years ago and its a steady decline while women in traditional marriages are happier.

You're a shit slut and not worth the ground i piss on, but god damn you could at least be honest about it. Literally exactly like the 2nd study you willingly ignored. Give it a read and notice some parallels.   I would never cheat on him or anyone else for that matter.   Taken girls are the easiest, your boyfriend just cant turn you on like i can so its the easiest catch when i go up to you and steal you away for a night.   I view cheating as an indirect way of breaking up with someone. I am a direct person if nothing else. I would break up with him before considering anyone else.    Ok but again i dont care.   I won't deny that TRP works on a certain type of girl but that type of girl is attracted to abusive men, which is what TRP philosophy is, abuse.    So you go from ignore the neckbeards to ""it works on some type of girl"". Good to know you're starting to admit to yourself the reality of the situation, but you've gotta take it a few steps further.   abusive men   If anything PUA is as feminist as it gets, we give you choice and hold you to a standard like we do our fellow man. Fail to meet the standard and you're fired. Meet the standard and you get to stick around. Ive never done shit my girl hasn't consented to and i always prod when i feel she's not really consenting. Why would any guy abuse the woman they love? Fact is almost no guy is gonna key her own car and fact is ""abusive"" is now synonym to ""he hurt my feelings when he fucked and chucked me!!!!!!!""

Guys like you can't contain their arrogance for 30 seconds let along long enough to get laid. I never called you a neckbeard or said that you couldn't get laid I just think you're an abusive piece of shit. You are abusing your girlfriend as are all other men that follow your philosophy. You falsely accuse me of treating my boyfriend of how you treat your girlfriend and say you feel sorry for him. If you feel sorry for a man you don't even know for how you think he is treated why don't you feel sorry for a woman you supposedly love for how you do know she is treated?

You're just saying that to make your personal pet peeve a special martyr of free speech and thinking. And you can't know what kind of a mother a slut would make, being a mother has nothing to do with having sex, except once. And unless being a virgin is one of the roles of being a wife, a slut can theoretically fulfill all the qualities of a good one. It's best to be honest with yourself and others about the real reasons of not liking things. I wouldn't settle down with a promiscuous person because I havent been promiscuous, and they get to both sleep around, and then settle down with me for a serious relationship. They get it all and I end up providing this all for them, it feels unfair and injust to me and makes me mad. Probably they same for you, you're not some superman, everyone has insecurities. Also people change, everyone wants to sleep around when they're young, especially men. Eventually both get tired and are ready to settle down, but some men suddenly want to settle down with a virgin, not someone with the same history as them. The most important part missing from your answer though is the submitters miconception that this subreddit brings justice. It doesn't, it's just a circlejerk subreddit that finds justice stories and and strokes their justice boners about it. Like justiceporn, only for specific situations."

SlutJustice,39ff3r,shmalz,34,Fri Jun 12 18:16:35 2015 UTC,"Single mothers are a burden.  We need a welfare state to care for these women, or they'll end up starving.  As the welfare state increases to accommodate single mothers, we end up with more single mothers. The children of single mothers are often dysfunctional.  They lack the values passed on by functional families and end up in prison (after committing crimes, some of which may be violent), or they end up as losers who suckle off the teat of the government. Proportionally fewer intelligent people.  Low time preference means that higher-IQ families use contraceptives to avoid having children, whereas high time preference individuals (who are stupid) have children.  Society needs a balance between Alphas and Gammas, and we're trending toward Gammas.  (Ever seen Detroit?  I rest my case.) Spread of STDs.  Education and condoms aren't enough--see the gay community for what promiscuity does to STD rates. Social resources devoted to combating the effects of the above.  Medicaid, CHIP, EBT, sex education, the PPACA contraceptive mandate, etc.  The total resources in society are limited, so using them to negate the deleterious aspects of sluthood is wasteful. Degradation of women.  In traditional society, women are valued for their feminine qualities.  In slut society, women are valued for their willingness to put out.  You can dress it up as sexual empowerment and sexual freedom all you want, but men use sluts as penis receptacles.  (You can pretend that it's women using men all you want, but that's a joke.)  /r/theredpill is a consequence of the slut revolution.  You want the nasties at TRP to disappear?  You remove sluthood, which is their incentive to act that way. An increase in abortions.  Abortion is morally wrong.  I know you don't care, but I don't care that you don't care. Sluthood discourages pair-bonding and healthy male-female relationships.  Marriage for life?  Why would I bother when I can fuck a 20-year-old college slut? I detest the hedonism of sluthood.  Enabling sluts creates a society of hedonistic sluthood.  Discouraging sluts reverses that trend.  Even if all the above weren't true, I would still oppose sluthood because it is spiritually destructive.  I'm no ascetic, but we as a society can do better than pump 'n' dumps."

SlutJustice,399bhx,VladMartel,9,Wed Jun 10 04:42:49 2015 UTC,"After-the-fact withdrawal of consent, LOL. How much simpler would things be if girls just quit being sluts? Nitpicking over when you ""gave consent"" and when you ""withdrew"" it is impossible for police to deal with:   Oh officer it was so terrible. Right when he was about to ejaculate, after we had been fucking in a half dozen different ways, I whispered ""no"" under my breath but he kept going for another 10 seconds.   Young men keep getting weaker and more timid, while young women keep getting, sluttier, more masculine, and more aggressively ""liberated."" Even if the odds of being raped were higher than before (instead of much lower, which they are), it isn't because the boys are rapier. It's because the definition of rape has been extended to include any ""unwanted advances"" or ""cheating on your boyfriend and regretting it,"" and girls are sleeping around a lot more and wind up in more sexual situations.  With as much anti-rape education & marketing we have out there, the only reason rape isn't drastically lower is because all that stuff is only hiding the increase in rape caused by slut behavior. For example (the one sluts flip out over) I don't think dressing immodestly is single-handedly causing men to rape, but it is advertising sexual receptivity, which will get you sexual attention (as it is intended to). Dressing provocatively is just one part of slut behavior, all of which contribute in varying amounts to to your risk of rape.  Ugh, why does it matter what you wear to a job interview? Why does it matter what you wear on a first date? Obviously, what you wear affects people's impression of you.  Slutwalks should offer many trolling opportunities, and I would consider any videos of slutwalks getting trolled to be on-topic."

It is pro-religious by nature because religions have always made sexuality morality a high priority. There are 2 main reasons I don't talk much religion. The first is that I don't know much and so I leave it to those who do. The second is that I want to keep euphoric Redditors honest, and not be able to dismiss our arguments as being entirely religious.   Even anti-religious people have to comb through the Bible to cherry pick things they morally oppose. Nobody ever says ""hurr, you only want to keep people from murdering because it's one of your fairy tale commandments,"" but when the topic is sexual morality, atheist fags think they get an easy ""checkmate, bigot."" I enjoy taking that away from them. Their incredulity is, in a word, delicious.  People should go right ahead and post relevant religious passages, and also explain them a little bit so heretics understand them. Not only do religions have a lot of insight into human nature, but it shows that people have cared about sexual morality for thousands of years.   Christian insights in particular seem to be a lot more refined than that perverted Jewish quack Freud's ""Madonna-whore"" hogwash, etc."
SlutJustice,396060,awesomesonofabitch,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:00:19 2015 UTC,Gotta devil's advocate you for a second. Not on the slut positivity thing; I think that sex is bad for you and a deceptive force that biology uses to keep things terrible. But on the idea that religion had it right at all. (Athiests don't either since they still have that 'the world is beautifull coz SCIENCE and stuff'.)  The very fact that anything or anyone exists is the problem. You can go back to before women were unshackled; but that leaves out guys like me who aren't able to be the baddest asshole on the mile. The other direction kills off those men and only rewards trollops that spread and betas who cuck.  The solution to the pendulum problem is to simply cut the pendulum. The insight that you seem to get from them is only one sided. There are no good answers save for the annihilation of all matter and energy.

Because you tossed it out like garbage when you turned to slutting. And then you took a dump on it with your little gang bang.  Your boyfriend (I mean your ex-boyfriend, LOL) did exactly what EVERY man worth a damn will do for the rest of your whore life. You may as well make a few bucks doing super-depraved varieties of pornography, because you are already untouchable. Obviously I don't actually want that since pornography is cultural AIDS, but from your perspective (and whores are universally selfish) it makes no difference. Go look at some old crackhead porn whores to see what life has in store for you.  Obviously whores are dumb as fuck and do all kinds of disgusting shit, but don't most of them have the sense to hide the sick shit they've done? You might be literally retarded. I can't get over it. Did you think your BF was a cuck, because that's the only way your little reveal wouldn't completely torpedo your relationship. He sure doesn't sound like a cuck to me. He sounds like a cool dude who was too good for you. You will NEVER get a man as good as him to marry you.  That ""Past is in the past"" bullshit is so true... in the sense that you can't go and get un-spitroasted. There's no de-whoring you. But that shit is on your permanent record, and you'll be feeling the effects until you draw your last breath. The odds of you finding a man to marry are bad. The odds of you finding a man that isn't utterly desperate are essentially zero. Any kids you manage to have will almost certainly be bastards.  LOL, 22 years old and you've thrown it all away. So many doors have been closed to you forever because you were so hungry for cock that one at a time wasn't enough for you. I'm sure your ""notch count"" (number of different cocks run through you) would already qualify you for slut status, but the spitroast is a special level of depravity, and plenty of guys who could tolerate 5 or 10 dicks getting stuck in you still won't be able to tolerate 2 at once. And that's not just the event itself, horrifying as it is, but also the implication it makes about how depraved your other sex has been. Two dicks at once is something most girls who do ass-to-mouth would balk at. And you, you little slut, ""don't think it's a big deal."" Yeah no biggie! Just something so repulsive that even most dudes wouldn't do it!  I shudder to think about the disgusting ways you've allowed your body to be abused and defiled just so some dirtbag can blow a load. That is not a thought men want to have about any woman they care about. It's horrific, like you, only you're whoriffic."

I love women and this site is all about helping and protecting them from a society that wants to break them.   But you must understand, I don't even consider sluts to be human, so they certainly can't be women. And a woman had to die for a slut to be created, ergo every slut has killed at least one (decent) woman. Slut encouragers may kill many, and so they are even worse.  Raping a decent woman should be a capital offense (and a hard thing to do by accident, since she'll actually resist). To a slut, sex is obviously cheap - just rubbin privates, no big deal - so she has no legitimate claim that unwanted sex is much worse than any other form of battery. Basically, the level of injury (or threat) to her during the rape should be the gauge for severity of the crime.  If you're not willing to take a black eye to avoid getting raped, then it's hard to consider it worse than a black eye!"

You fucked this guy's """"""friend."""""" He will find out. It will ruin the best thing you ever had. You will never have the beautiful life and family that you could have had. Pretty simple, actually.  Even if you do ever have children, they will be the spawn of a cheating whore who would have been publicly stoned to death in any decent society. They'll be broken pieces of shit like you, so if you don't have the fortitude to jump off a bridge, at least get yourself spayed or whatever they call it when whores are rendered sterile.  The silver lining around this cloud is that you fully deserve to die alone, in a one bedroom apartment, reeking of cat piss. And your death will be a blessing to everyone.  Take solace in the knowledge that this guy, who stayed true to you amidst tons of beautiful German girls, will also take the pain of your treachery to his grave as well. You had the chance that millions of women in the modern West would kill for, and YOU BLEW IT. Now why don't you just go back to being a cumrag fleshlight since that is the only purpose you will ever serve to anyone.   I do think telling him is an imperative, just because we have always had great communication and trust, and starting this next stage of our lives together with the basis of my unknown infidelity feels so wrong. But at the same time, a confession would ruin absolutely everything. Like, I literally would not know what to do if we were to break up. So what should I do? How would you want to be approached, if at all, by your SO with a confession of cheating? Is better now than later, or never, the best way to approach this?   You're overthinking this. You've destroyed everything. You were always worthless, and the world would have been a better place if you had been aborted by your mother."

Let me also say that the boyfriend's ""friend"" who she cheated with is also a degenerate piece of trash with no character, loyalty, or self-worth.  May he continue playing the field while enjoying rebound flings and sloppy seconds from sluts who cuck their faithful boyfriends before he settles down for a frumpy, past-her-prime girl who has been penetrated by the cocks of dozens of better men."

These pieces of shit will get bumped to the front of the line on DOTR, it will be a short drop hanging, and the audience will cheer with every twitch. Only a degenerate would do that to a stranger, and only a fatherless sociopath scum of the earth would do it to a friend.  Treachery is what gets you to the ninth circle of Hell, and sending them there would be the kind of righteous satisfaction that only comes from cutting a cancer out of your society.

SlutJustice,38emwk,peneom,14,Fri Jun 5 15:11:38 2015 UTC,"There, there, /u/peneom you are the first slut to actually elicit a modicum of sympathy from this slut-shamer, and that is saying something.  I felt your TL;DR was good enough that I could have written it:   Tl;dr: ugly piece of shit who's jealous of the beautiful girl who has a boyfriend and can get boyfriends rather than have to be someone's cumrag to get laid.   That's a sick self-burn if there ever was one! Most people, and certainly most sluts, are simply incapable of that level of brutally honest introspection. I'm going to make /r/SlutJustice history by suggesting that [takes deep breath] maybeyouaren'tacompletelyirredeemableslut.  My impression of you is that you aren't really the slutting type, and you just let loneliness or something drag you down to their level.  Please stop letting this faggot defile you. Don't let ANY man defile you. You're a 22yo woman! You CAN have a boyfriend! And one that isn't fucking around on you like the girl who you're jealous of (Who will lose this guy, btw. Bet on it). Of course prettier girls are going to have an easier time of it, but these days they usually fuck up hard too.   The path to getting the absolute best man you can get, one who actually commits and ultimately spends his life with you is pretty straightforward. This has a much bigger effect on your happiness than school or employment, and should be prioritized above those things as much as possible. Marry the right man, and that other shit will just cease to matter.:   Be as pretty as you can be. Be thin, dress feminine, get your teeth fixed if they're jacked. Present yourself as best you can. Be as chaste as you can. Men don't commit to cumrags unless they have no other options. Don't fuck a guy unless you - at the very least - think you'll be able to secure a marriage. Every new dick lowers your value in the mind of a potential husband. And non-sluts are especially precious. A man looking for a wife will respect ""Hard to get,"" but a guy looking to dump loads will move on. Aim for a traditional guy, especially older ones. No manchildren. Older means likely be less disgusted by your past slutting (young traditional guy might write you off), as he'll have seen so much worse. He'll probably also be more attractive to you anyway. Everybody wins here. Don't embarrass him. This includes obvious things like tantrums in public, and being shitty to his friends, but also things like bringing up your slutty past, being too friendly with other men, etc. Demand adherence to tradition gender roles. This is the magic powder for marriage, babe. It sends all the right signals, and gives all the right feelings to men and women. 10 years together, and I still help my perfectly healthy 28yo wife into the car, every time, just like I make all major household decisions every time (and minor ones most times). The shift to this approach from the willy-nilly egalitarian way was the best thing to ever happen to our relationship. 100% realtalk.   The basic idea is to do your best to look and act like wife material. You say you're ""ugly"" but it is rare that a 22yo non-deformed (includes non-fat) white girl is legit ugly.   Play the hand you were dealt (your DNA) the best you can, and you will get the most that life has to offer."
SlutJustice,38emwk,Lv99_BixNood,7,Wed Jun 3 19:17:04 2015 UTC,"I'm already as attractive as I can possibly be, I wear makeup and lift weights and all of that, but I still can't compete with the average girl unless I get plastic surgery  If I could get a boyfriend I would have by now, I'm 22 years old and past my prime, it's unlikely I'll get a boyfriend, if it happens then great but I'm not holding my breath."
SlutJustice,38emwk,_Kahlo,22,Wed Jun 3 19:32:44 2015 UTC,"peneom that's just not true. I'm not whiteknighting you because I don't know you from a bar of soap but please don't sell yourself short. You are not getting what you need or want by being someones whore. Ultimately you will not feel good inside. It's fleeting. And you know this because you made your post saying how awful it makes you feel that this guy uses you and goes back to his girlfriend.   You cannot be that hideous if someone will regularly have sex with you. I'm not encouraging that behaviour or saying it's a good thing. What I am doing is putting it into perspective. I know lots of girls like you that use sex and sexual favours as an ego boost and an emotional crutch. It always ends badly.  I promise, you are not as ugly as you claim to be. You are worth so much more than what this man-child is giving you no matter how beautiful or ugly you happen to be. I've seen really ugly people have relationships - I know that sounds mean of me but I'm just trying to tell you that you're stuck in a particularly bad way of thinking about yourself, about relationships and about sex.  You're 22 years old! 22! I'm a good looking 24 year old and I haven't dated in 6 years. Having a boyfriend or girlfriend is not the be all end all of life. I promise you that. And especially not if they are like the majority of men these days, effeminate liberal spineless idiots.  You can spend time on doing whatever it is that makes you happy right now. Educate yourself, read some awesome books, go to gym, go running, smoke a cigar, travel, get into Hearthstone, join a club, whatever the hell you want. I promise you that the boyfriend will come along - and when he does come along you will regret that you let yourself be treated like another mans prostitute.   I've known women like you and they have been able to make a change and the change is palpable. The reality is that when you give off vibes of ""I'm ugly and desperate"" you attract losers and users and that's it. If you fight the inner voice that drags you down you can raise yourself up even if you never change your opinion of yourself you can fake it and make it.  If you're not convinced, fine, but let me tell you that the way of the slut does not lead to happiness, it does not work. If you continue this way you'll end up 35, used up washed up and left with the memories of all the men that treated you like a fleshlight. The feeling that made you post what you posted will be magnified by a hundred. Make a change, it's worth it."

Men of course like pretty faces but the right man will be so enthralled with you - respectful of your self-worth and self-control (if you stop having sex), intellectually stimulated by your various pursuits, soothed by your self-sufficiency and appreciation for him - that he will want you for life. Please do not resign yourself to being a side chick, not only are you settling for less than you deserve but you're letting some piece of shit guy take advantage of you.

SlutJustice,38emwk,crubbity,5,Thu Jun 4 00:09:25 2015 UTC,"The first step is to accept yourself. Why would anyone love you if you aren't able to love yourself? It's okay to recognize that there are people who are prettier than you, but in the end, you are you. Have some pride in that!  Also us men are not all that hung up on looks as we're said to be. The biggest turn ons for most men looking for a fiancee/wife is that you're trustworthy, loyal, and respect yourself. That is, the exact opposite of being a cumrag."
SlutJustice,38emwk,IVIaskerade,5,Thu Jun 4 00:19:11 2015 UTC,"Holy shit just stop. What the hell is wrong with your self esteem? Do you have like one eye or something?

If you get into shape and do things normally you'll end up much happier. Plus if you feel that you need sex to function then you are weak and fucked up. You're 22 years old, you still have another decade or more. You're only past your prime in your mind and if you've fucked like 20 dudes.

I don't begrudge her at all for having a past and don't think having a lot of sexual history makes you a bad person or a poor choice in a partner.   Sure thing, Mr Datapoint. I like the euphemism ""a past"" because it glosses over the gruesome reality of all the countless dirtbags who have defiled your woman in ways you probably ""respect"" her too much to do.   we have compatible views about sex within the context of relationships and to me, that is what matters in the end.   The end should have been the instant you found out what a fleshlight your gf was.   I should mention that in my entry in the spreadsheet there are 6 blank columns interspersed between the the beginning and the last column that have entries. I can't help but wonder what values those fields are used for. I'm sure you can use your imagination to assume what they might be. I really don't like the idea that I'm being graded or scored, it has made me feel (irrationally) that sleeping with her is about conducting a performance and not about two people simply enjoying each other and exploring the things that turn them on.   Dear God, man. Do you have, or have you ever heard of ""dignity?"" Sure, she's a whore. And of course whores have opinions like anyone else. But this whore has meticulously documented her whore opinion of all the whoring shit she's done. The discomfort you feel is what the vestigal remains of your masculinity correctly recognize as this worthless  cumdumpster having the nerve to judge you, and then to put it on paper.   I'm sure you wouldn't walk if you murdered her, but CUMSLUT.XLSX admitted into evidence would definitely soften up your sentence!  Dude, I ain't ever even heard of a pussy like you before. You actually call her your ""girlfriend"" when she has extensively documented cum-chugging exploits and shown it to you?

Just so you know, this is the kind of thing that doesn't happen to non-degenerates, the people who don't try to have group sex, especially when they are in a relationship.  Obviously she's prettier than you are, which is what you're actually concerned about. Your bf is stoked he gets to bang his better-looking ex again, and having you there is just so he can get away with it. If you were thinking with your brain instead of your twat, you'd have realized that by asking for a gang bang, you have irreversibly changed your BF's perception of you from GF to fuck hole. This relationship is doomed, and so are your future relationships (standard for sluts).  It turns out all the ""sex-positivve"" stuff was a pack of lies, and in fact your whoring ways are guaranteed to come back and wreck your life.

And that happens all the time. A lot of girls, even ones who resist at first, turn to sluttery because it seems like easy pleasure. It's like drugs, only with society encouraging it.

I know that's not PC but the amount of damage slores like this cause warrants death in my opinion.  Our country has no problem putting criminals to death. I think sluts that are this outrageous and ridiculous should meet the same fate. Most criminals probably create far less emotional destruction than people like these. The worst part too is that people like her perpetuate this as normal and a good thing. Nobody really empathizes with criminals except other criminals. For some reason though (jews) our society has given these useful idiots a mouthpiece to voice destructive and emotionally violent behavior.  She might as just say I WANT TO FUCK BIG NIGGER DICKS for her profile bio because that's exactly what she is going for. The only good news I can see out of this is her husband is likely some traitorous wall street faggot who has no spine or morals anyway. If he is some hardworking guy though who works a bunch of minimum wage jobs I truly feel sorry for him and hope he divorces this cunt and lets he get raped and murdered by the niggers she is obviously fucking.  Is this too many ""nigger"" words for this sub? I'm half jewish though so that should give me some agency on saying NIGGER.

Because of that, you'll have to do a more advance search if you're interested. I don't have time right now but if you are actually interested I can definitely find you some credible sources on that.

SlutJustice,37za8g,IVIaskerade,5,Mon Jun 1 03:50:35 2015 UTC,"""Sex-positivity"", like all feminist ideas, goes against nature. Sex feels good so people naturally want to do it, but it isn't healthy to think of it as always 100% good, even with EntHusIaStic CoNseNT.  Disease and unwanted pregnancy are the most immediately obvious consequences, and while modern technology and legislation may have reduced those risks, human psychology is still wired to take sex seriously - nothing like the modern degenerate notion that it's just ""sexy fun times.""  Sex with someone you don't want to have kids with will always have some negative psychological effect (though not necessarily a net-negative effect), because on some level you are consciously overriding the part of your mind telling you not to do it."

It's not ""insecurity"" the way the /r/relationships degenerates like to say. You care about this girl and the thought of her being defiled by other men is disgusting and tragic to you.  Long-distance relationships are already at a major disadvantage, but when the girl is a little slut, then they are totally doomed. Also, she's probably been fucking around on you.  Women know instinctively to keep their slutting a secret, unless they are completely broken. So you know that any slut stories she shares (or even hints at) are just the tip of the iceberg. She's referring to gruesome, nightmarish encounters that end with her leaking various fluids from various holes, while the rando who just dumped his load quickly gets dressed so he can get away from the dirty whore (she having served her only purpose).  I find the fact that she even hints at it to be very telling. Maybe she's feeling you out to see if you're going to dump her for being a slut, as you should. Or maybe she's just such a cumdumpster that she doesn't think it's a big deal. Either way, she's decided that sex is cheap.  So don't waste any time with her. It was never going to work anyway."
SlutJustice,37yqju,Do_you_even_Cam,-15,Sun May 31 15:27:24 2015 UTC,This is beyond my perception... Just... Wow.  This is blatantly categorising women into sluts or holy virgins who have arrived unscathed just for your pleasure. Even though I may see monogamy to be my ideology it's commonplace for relationships to not work out... If they don't you move on- even if you've had sex or whatever. Now this girl I know for a fact has had two exes and I don't plan on giving up on her by 'slut shaming'.  She was cheated on by her second ex and I don't see her cheating on someone when she's been on the receiving end. Additionally she's been my best friend for two years before we started going out.  Before you begin to label someone a slut learn their fucking story.

SlutJustice,37yqju,VladMartel,14,Tue Jun 2 03:51:39 2015 UTC,"This is blatantly categorising women into sluts or holy virgins who have arrived unscathed just for your pleasure.   Well that's just cuck talk, boy. You're not doing yourself any favors with that. Quite the opposite is true. She's a slut who freely hands out pussy for random guys' pleasure. She's failed to secure commitment twice, and I predict it's not gonna work out with you either because you'll either dump her out of disgust (the right way) or you'll get dumped because you're the kind of pussy who posts faggy shit like that on Reddit where you make excuses for her whoring (the cuck way).  The thing to keep in mind is that its likely you don't know the whole truth. The only thing we can say with certainty is that you comprise at most 1/3 of the cocks that have been run through this little hose-hound, and each one means less to her than the one before it. It's kinda like how time seems to pass faster as you age, because each new year is a smaller and smaller fraction of your life. She'll be in double-digits before she's 23, I guarantee it.  Now, since you brought up the topic of slut-shaming, let me tell you that slut-shaming is a good thing and you should do it every chance you get. It's fun for you, and though the little slut getting shamed won't enjoy it, she does need to hear it. If sluts were shamed more, there'd be fewer of them out there slutting. And that's good for everybody, most of all women.   I don't see her cheating on someone when she's been on the receiving end   Applying male rationality to female behavior is never going to serve you well. Her getting cheated on actually increases the odds of further sluttery. You see, the Venn diagram of ""sluts"" and ""broken women"" is almost a perfect circle, and her boyfriend cheating on her only made her more broken.   Before you begin to label someone a slut learn their fucking story.   Pal, if you looked around this sub you'd know I know sluts, and the story is always the same: Hit puberty, love attention, fuck around like there's no tomorrow, get a little older, get less attention, start to panic, reality that they'll have to settle for a dork if they ever want a family drives them insane.  Don't be a slut-enabler. Just tell this little twat that she can take a hike, and take her ragged-out pussy with her."

I broke out of that cage years ago thank god. Never had a complete slut for a girlfriend but was surrounded by people who took the ""let's fuck everyone"" attitude. Not surprisingly they also smoke a ton of pot and many did X, coke, molly, ketamine, DMT, you name it.

Let's break this down because you're obviously really dumb, and /r/relationships is a bunch of degenerate white knights who are lying to you. No man wants a slut, unless he's a cuck. Some men will tolerate a slut, if he's desperate, or he's just trying to fuck you, or if the slut in question is much younger or prettier (or maybe rich enough?) than he could normally get.   ""The past is the past"" goes right out the window when a man is thinking about marriage. Past behavior indicates future behavior, sure. But the real issue is that a man's wife is sacred to him, and a slut has been repeatedly desecrated by other men. That's a concept you may not grasp. You remember all those guys dumping loads in you like you were a deluxe Fleshlight? Now that he's trying to think of you as a wife and mother of his children, those events become disgusting and tragic. To make him feel like an even bigger chump, you did all this while you were at your prime, and now he only gets the old leftovers.  In summary:   You brought this on yourself by being a little slut You compounded the problem by waiting until your looks had faded Your fiancé's reaction is normal, and other men will feel the same Of the men who would've married you before you started slutting, at least 90% (the top 90%) wouldn't now The only solution is to lower your standards quite a lot, as in guys you wouldn't have touched at 20   That's how the slut's life goes. You made terrible decisions, which will now follow you to the grave and beyond. If you don't know what I mean by ""beyond,"" I'm referring to the fact that if you do manage to have children, they will be sired by the kind of loser whose only option is to breed with a slut.  I have an idea for a ""Slut's Hail Mary"" so to speak. You could change your name, move to a place where no one knows you, quit acting like such a fucking whore, and concoct a fictional story to explain how you're 30yo, unmarried, but somehow not a slut. That could, if executed well, result in a upgrade to the quality of man who'd marry you. It's a super long shot, and it would probably blow up in your face because you've already fucked up your life pretty bad, so it's not like you can just turn into a master con-artist over night.   It sounds more like the plot to a crazy movie, but it might work (and it beats your original plan of slutting away your youth, then trying to settle down)."

If they're not winning then how come the guys who commit the most to women get the least back?  If a girl throws all her rules (and heterosexuality) out the window for a rando then who's really the special guy?    Fucking plebbit expects men to be content with only being good enough for women when they need them for something.  I already know who's really getting objectified.

In this scenario, the guys defiling the sluts are the closest thing to ""winners"" but the alternatives here are the cucks and the sluts, so not much of a win.  I get the appeal of sex with different girls. But as far as I can see, the main appeal of 2 girls simultaneously would be to someone who either is numb to normal sex, or gets off on degrading the girls. It's just pornographic and vulgar. I actually think it would be less degenerate for a guy to have a threeway merely as a pretext for sex with the ""new"" girl, than wanting the group sex aspect."

Some dirtbag blowing his infected loads into your GF is far more likely to result in disease transmission from him to her than the other way around.

SlutJustice,377pon,coon-hunter,8,Tue May 26 11:24:05 2015 UTC,"Original:   So me and this guy have been friends for years. That's all we ever saw each other as though, then one night we were talking and he said that he would sleep with me whilst we were somehow on the subject of sex. He asked me to be a fuck buddy a while ago but I said no, because I felt like it'd make me feel cheap. So I continued just dating guys instead. I confided in my friend about every failed date I had, one day he said he'd love to have a relationship with me, so a few days later we went to the cinema and went back to his flat after just to have a laugh. While I was there and we were cuddling he just looked at me and said that he doesn't think he can commit to a relationship because he's currently studying and working and never has time and wouldn't want to start something he couldn't commit to because he doesn't want to hurt me. We started sleeping together, because we both have needs and he's a good fwb, we watch films, eat crap, cuddle, kiss and have a laugh before and after sex. The thing is, he treats me like a girlfriend. He told me we'd be a cute couple but he needs to get all his work out the way first and he said he does like me but he's not ready to make a commitment he can't fully dedicate to and it'd be wrong of him to do that. The thing is... He's on dating sites, not looking for anything serious. And he said before when we were on about sex that he just wants to have fun sex with people which I feel like too... I mean, we're young after all. But it hurts me that he's still on dating sites looking for people to sleep with, because he told me he likes me and he treats me like a girlfriend. It's so difficult because I really like him as a person. I don't really understand how he can say he likes me and wants a relationship with me before, yet still is willing to sleep with other women. I'm on tinder but if I met someone I'd feel like I was cheating because I'm far too loyal so I guess I need some light shed on the situation. I told him I couldn't do it anymore because I was starting to like him and I didn't wanna get hurt and he said he understands, but he really does like me, he's just not ready, but he wouldn't want to hurt me so it's up to me obviously. I said I'd like to feel like something could happen with us at some point and he said ""I'd never say never"" but I'm just confused. I don't want a relationship right now, but I would like something to happen with us in the near future. Please. Help me. :( Tl;dr: fwb said he likes me, still looking for other people to sleep with, I feel hurt, I dunno what to do."
SlutJustice,377pon,_Kahlo,10,Mon May 25 15:49:27 2015 UTC,"Poor thing. Every woman thinks she is so special and exceptional that a man will commit to her even after she has demonstrated her deep lack of self worth and self control. I know I and most girls were taught that sex only happens when two people are in love, so I think that women assume a man will love her after intercourse occurs. However, it is quite obvious that this is never the case. Women have no excuse anymore - we need to be our own agents. No more of this false victimhood rhetoric when girls have the ability to see what is happening and stop a man from ""taking advantage"" of her."

Then you agreed to it because you are a cheap slut.   he just wants to have fun sex with people which I feel like too... I mean, we're young after all.   Good luck finding a husband with a slutty past. You'll really be scraping the bottom of the barrel. See it turns out that your actions today have consequences tomorrow, and you making light of your sluttery doesn't change that.   I don't really understand how he can say he likes me and wants a relationship with me before, yet still is willing to sleep with other women.    What's not to understand? You're a slut, and this guy wants steady pussy until he can find a girl worth committing to. That isn't you. In fact, as a general rule, you will never find a guy as attractive as he is to commit to you, because you've already decided that you'll just hand out pussy if you meet one of those guys. If you do manage to trick some guy into marrying your whore ass, it will be some dorky beta-bitch you aren't really attracted to.   I don't want a relationship right now, but I would like something to happen with us in the near future.   WTF is this twisted whore logic? Slutting is not the path to a real committed relationship. Too bad your father never taught you this (because he was either absent or a eunuch)    Tl;dr: fwb said he likes me, still looking for other people to sleep with, I feel hurt, I dunno what to do.   I think you mean he likes getting laid. He only likes you for providing him with easy pussy. As far as what you should do, HOW ABOUT STOP SLUTTING YOU DIRTY SKANK?"

The twist here is that she lied about how nasty of a little slut she was, but he found out (LOL).  Just so we're all on the same page: A slut's past will harm every single relationship she is ever in. Every time.  Any guy you are with is going to think less and less of you the more guys who have fucked you. This means that non-sluts have the following advantages of sluts (all else being equal):  1.) They can get higher value, more attractive men to commit to/marry them.  2.) Those men will prize her more highly, and work harder to keep her  In this case, the BF already caught OP in a lie, so now he's doubting everything she says about the situation - a situation, which even taken at face value is no good for the BF. Here's a few examples of what's going through his head:  1.) She's fucked way more guys than she admitted to  2.) She actually did like doing whatever nasty sodomy she now won't do with him  3.) She actually did other nastier things also  OP, you fucked up. You were a little whore, and then you tried to ease off, but it doesn't work that way.

SlutJustice,374u0h,communal_spoon,-23,Thu Jun 11 10:31:30 2015 UTC,"There is no scientific consensus that increase in male partner counts correlate with higher rates of depression(for male or for partner), divorce, mental issues, etc. It only coincides with higher rates of drug abuse(that population is easy to spot), lower likelihood of self-reported sexual marital satisfaction and higher propensity to commit crime, and higher rates of STDs(again, both should be easy to spot).   So when marrying a male slut, ones know what you're getting(unless you're blind about his drug use, STDs or criminal/rapist past). Meanwhile, marrying a female slut, you are more likely than not to be divorced, depressed, lied to about her sexual past(women lie on surveys about their counts, as well as to their partners) and for your children to have worse outcomes in school IN ADDITION to the normal shit like STDs, etc.   Oh, Sometimes your children might even be your own children. (here's a collection of every study done on the subject of parternity fraud till date: http://www.childsupportanalysis.co.uk/analysis_and_opinion/choices_and_behaviours/misattributed_paternity.htm)"
SlutJustice,374u0h,rafay_M,12,Mon May 25 01:43:01 2015 UTC,"Not sure how I ended up wading into the cesspool that is this subreddit, but I'm going to weigh in here as an actual social scientist who conducts behavioral research for a living.  It's nice that you're at least trying to cite scientific evidence, but there's a LOT wrong with your argument...   No direct tests - Going back through the studies in the link you provided here, unless I missed it, I haven't found a single one that actually finds a statistically significant difference in the effects of male behavior and female behavior with a direct test (note that testing separately for significant effects within each group is NOT the same as testing for a significant difference between the groups). In fact, many of the studies don't even look at men at all -- they include only women in the sample, so they can't possibly speak to the differences you're asserting. Ignoring contradictory evidence - In fact, I'm not sure if you even realized this, but one of the studies you linked actually finds the exact opposite; the whole article, which came from your link, is about how they DIDN'T find gender differences --   ""In the study, 33 percent of men and 24 percent of women said they’d had a relationship that was 'only having sex' with someone. Higher male participation no doubt reflects the sexual double standard, but while more men have casual sex, they experience the same emotional distress afterwards. They found no difference between the responses of men and women.""  Confounding variable (Social Stigma) - Even if there were a gender difference, every correlation you listed could be explained by the difference in social stigma attached to female partner counts -- that is, the shaming itself, which you are personally perpetuating -- rather than the actual behavior. It seems reasonable to suspect that because women are told by society to feel shame about having lots of partners, they do feel shame about it -- being bullied, belittled, and insulted does tend to lead to depression, suicide, drug use, mental health issues, etc. And by the same token, because men are told by society that their significant others are shameful if they've had lots of partners, they feel shame about them, too. This is particularly inconvenient for you because it would mean people like YOU are one cause of these social problems, not the women's behavior. Reverse causation /endogeneity - As one of your links even points out, we cannot rule out the possibility of reverse causality or endogeneity (in fact, it specifically says the direction of causality runs both ways). Regarding gender differences -- if they even exist -- it may be that these correlations exist in part because since high partner counts carry such a negative social stigma for women, women with depression or mental issues or drug addiction would be most likely to choose that lifestyle. Since the exact same sexual behavior is considered ""normal"" for males, there is no disincentive (in fact, quite the opposite) for healthy, reputable men to continually increase their partner counts. That would mean there's nothing about male sexual activity that's less destructive than female sexual activity, it's just a self-fulfilling prophecy brought on by the unequal norms you are perpetuating. Lack of Theory - Scientists reach all sorts of bad conclusions when their inquiry is driven by naive empiricism rather than by theory, especially when it comes to causation like you're trying to assert. You're pointing to just correlations, but what possible causal mechanism are you asserting? On what theoretical grounds should we hypothesize that female behavior would be more damaging than male behavior in terms of the effects you're talking about? Your own link suggests that the primary reason for expecting any gender difference is the double standard itself --    ""They found no difference between the responses of men and women. Dr. Claire Kamp Dush, professor of human sciences at Ohio State University, said: ‘That was unexpected because there is still this sexual double standard in society that says it is OK for men to have casual sexual relationships, but it is not OK for women. ‘But these results suggest that poor mental health and casual sex are linked, whether you’re a man or a woman."""

What you're saying basically amounts to ""Its easy for everyone except who it is easy for"".  Also, I'm seeing an interesting pattern with these comments. You find our judgement of women's sexual past problematic, and so you react by... judging our sexual past.   I mean, of all the things to hate about me. My sexist views. My immorality. My rapes of women in the past. You choose to imagine my virginity.  Its startling where your priorities are.   Btw, the whole of humanity, minus the west in the last thirty years(and even then only on the internet), have been slut-shaming forever. Especially women, Were they all virgins too?"

I've been to a slut and proud parade and women use the word more than men anyway so what part of what I'm saying is hateful? I am pointing out the data. Nothing more. I am not saying to harass sluts or demean them. I am not a member of slutjustice.   I just think people who are politically correct to the point they tune everything else out are dumb.

Only because I am for woman being allowed to have the same sex life than men, I am not in favour for feminist rallies who are doing the exact opposite from this sub.  When you express inherent anger about a social construct it usually stems from subjective opinions you were told as a child. Despite some people claim it to be atheism, it was in fact hatred that drove humanity in some seriously fucked up problems:  Hatred on gays  Hatred on blacks  Hatred on going to school with blacks  Hatred on jews  Hatred on sluts  At first comparing slutshaming with the holocaust might seem a little bit idiotic, but there are some 3rd world countries in which they kill little girls for being sluts after they are raped by their father (they should have dressed differently amirite).  And for some reason reading the shit on this subreddit makes me think that you would like to introduce similar laws if you were in charge.  Everyone is allowed to get happy the way he wants and everyone screaming loudly against that has usually no point in a logical, rational discourse about the topic. You can say I am wrong on that but you have to present evidence to support your claim just as I now presented cases where hatred against unnormality lead to horrible things."

Audio comedy is easier because it benefits from cadence and tone of voice, which is actually more important than words.

If you are really lacking in the conscience dept, it might be a very small voice compared to the voices saying ""HAHA, slay a bunch of HB7s this weekend, spin dem plates."" There is definitely pleasure available to those who don't care about others.  Just realize that most women want a family and children, and most men don't want to marry and have kids with women who've been fucked by a bunch of other dudes (nor should they, since the failure rate of slut marriages is so high).

Thing about these slut walks is that it brings out all these psuedo-lesbo whores who weren't really raped but want to have crocodile tears and rally together to hate on men.  I mean who goes out on the streets like that after a traumatic experience? It makes no sense. They target the wrong people. ""Hey lets go get angry at everyone - like you know the 99.9% of people who also find rape abhorrent - let's go get in their faces and act like obnoxious bitches to prove to them rape sucks!""  It's a simple fact that society wants to ignore: immodest behavior breeds a sick society. When you walk around like most women nowdays, when you have casual sex and treat it like a game, when you promote sodomy, when you promote strong pornographic use - all these things mean that you are not going to live in a society that places value on sexual intimacy. You are in effect breeding a rapist mindset. I mean that for those who truly do rape, because so many ""rapes"" are just sluts who wake up after a night out showing their boobs to everyone and some equally drunk guy takes her home and she suddenly wakes up with a conscience and decides she was raped cos he's not goodlooking enough, that isn't rape.   Liberal logic is so twisted. You want to promote a society where sex is shoved in your face and degeneracy is at every turn; but you also want to pretend that this type of society doesn't produce sick individuals who would find it okay to rape someone.  It's these same people who want Islam in their countries alongside faggots; completely ignoring the contradiction - faggots would be hanged by the Islamists.  I shit you not most of these women on slut walks have NOT been raped; they are blue haired new wave feminazi lesbians who want to use rape trauma as an excuse to further their anti-male, anti-modesty agenda.

SlutJustice,36ywjz,_Kahlo,18,Sat May 23 12:11:56 2015 UTC,"Nice throwaway name /u/iamavictimthrowaway but you're not a victim of anything except a degenerate, hypersexualized society. What you are is a slut.  I'm going to try to keep this to a reasonable length, but it's hard because there are SO MANY ways you are full of shit. Suffice it to say, YOU WERE NOT RAPED. You were just being a slut and then you realized that this was going to cost you your boyfriend so you tried to spin the story.  1.) You invited some skanky musician over to your place, to do drugs while no one else was home. This right here by itself is slut behavior. It proves intent, and your boyfriend would be justified in dumping you even if the story ended here.  2.) You let this guy fuck you with only the most cursory resistance. NEWSFLASH: WOMEN USUALLY RESIST THE FIRST TIME BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO SEEM LIKE SLUTS. It's not hard to stop a guy from fucking you. I know this because my wife is half my size and she can stop me easily. One time I even said (curiously, not threatening) ""see if you can stop me"" and she did, with minimal effort. Close your legs, roll over, ball up, scream, ANY ACTUAL RESISTANCE WILL STOP SEX! Of course, this would indicate you actually not wanting it to happen.   In case you're wondering, I would hold my wife to the same standard I'm holding you to. If she tells me she's raped, she better have something to show for it, or at least the story better have some obvious threat involved. And she doesn't think that's unreasonable because, unlike you, she's honest.  How can a guy trust you if you just hand out pussy like that? If a homeless asks you for some money, do you just empty out your bank account and give it to him? Would that make him a mugger and not just a beggar? No!   I barely knew this guy and god knows if he has some anger issues I haven't found out about yet.   Must be why you invited him over to do drugs alone with you! For argument's sake, let's say he did have anger issues, and he did get violent with you, is a black eye really worse than getting RAPED? You'd still have your boyfriend and your rapist would be in prison (because he'd be an actual rapist).   He took my shirt off and started kissing my breasts.   OMG, he ripped off your shirt like Hulk Hogan?!?!?? Oh wait, you mean you held your arms up to help him.   I did as he told me to but grabbed a condom on my way there. Thank god he put it on.   You handed him a condom. ""Please stick your dick in me.""  I could go on and on with #2, but I don't feel like typing 10 pages of why you are a lying whore when I've already made the point.  3.) You haven't reported this to the police. Why not? They don't punish false rape claims unless they are particularly egregious (as in obviously vindictive). Maybe you don't want to get in trouble for being a druggie? Or more likely you don't want to try to sell your bullshit lies to professionals who would pick your story apart even better than I did.  You are a disgusting slut, and your attempt to claim victimhood is extra disgusting because real rapes actually occur. Trying to leech sympathy from people by equating what you did with getting raped is pathetic and you deserve every drop of shame you feel."

It proves intent, and your boyfriend would be justified in dumping you even if the story ended here.   So much this.  I was once day-drinking at home (no job, waiting for school to restart in January) when a good friend from middle school asked me if I was up to anything. I had just moved back to my hometown and wanted to catch up with old acquaintances. I said no, and he could come over and watch movies if he wanted to. I truly had no intention of sexual activity but I see now in retrospect how I must have come across. When he arrived, I got up off the couch and realized just how drunk I was. I'd just felt warm and happy while chilling in my recliner but when I stood up I was staggering drunk. I let him in, apologized for my current state, made some coffee. When I sat down on the couch he forcefully kissed me.  Did I squirm around and passively express resistance? Did I ""get scared"" and just let him take what he wanted?  EFF. NO. I pushed him away (one hand on face, one on shoulder - was taught that in self defense class) and said, ""I don't want that, please go.""  He tried again. I socked him as hard as possible on the side of the head and used much stronger language to tell him just how much I wanted him to leave.  It was my fault for not thinking things through, and several years later I feel convicted about even being alone at home with a man. It is safer and more responsible to only meet in public places. It was his fault for knowing about my drunken state and not being honorable. It was on me to get an immoral man out of my house, and I did.  I have acted this way in response to every attack. Two escalated much further than that but I have preserved my dignity. It's the same story with most of my friends who have also been attacked. I don't know how or why these women on here are so woefully lacking in self-determination but they're adults with a world of resources at their fingertips - it's on them now."

Tells me she loves me like family and has/had no romantic feelings. But insists we remain emotionally close.   This is her internal slut-shaming. She knows she's a little whore with no value except as a semen receptacle. But if she keeps you as her ""friend"" then that somehow makes her life as a cumdumpster less shameful. I encourage you to kick back and watch this slut melt down, which she is going to do, with or without you.  On the one hand, you could have kept her if you'd treated her like the garbage whore she is, instead of doing those ""sweet things"" for her. On the other hand, you're much better off without sluts in your life. Remember that the only thing a slut is good for is dumping loads, and they are a vice you should avoid. It's probably a little healthier than watching porn, which you should also not do.

People will lie to you about how you can just fuck as many guys as you want, but the reality is that no man wants to marry a slut. And the kind of man who does marry a slut is the guys who don't have other options.   You might be able to pretend everything is fine for the next 10-15 years, because men will line up to dump a load in you. But when you go looking for someone to stay with, the line will be much shorter (and composed of much less desirable men). And it will only get worse over time, as your youth fades, and the number of men with carnal knowledge of you goes up. By 30-35 you'll have a much harder time believing that sluttery was a good choice. Biology is merciless.  So you think long and hard about what you want out of life. If it's spending over half of your life alone or (at best) settling for some dork you wouldn't touch right now, then go ahead and keep fucking dudes like there's no tomorrow.

It's because they were sluts, and the thing about sluts is that once they've lost their youth, they even lose the one thing they were good for (fucking).  This is 100% real talk, not feel-good bullshit you get from the degenerates in /r/relationships. If you've never heard this before it is because you had a weak or absent father, and I'm sorry for that. Don't be a slut, because the party will be over when your youth has faded, and you'll still have half your life ahead of you."

(shitty allegory but you'll get it).  i'm absolutely not special in any way, but if i weren't happily married i could cherrypick  from my middle aged, female friends. if you don't want to fight over who gets to scrape the bottom of the barrel, turn around NOW. show some modesty. and thank me in a few years.( a prayer will do)"

She's spent her entire life getting defiled, and has probably had more jizz in her than you can imagine. Plus she's a piece of shit cheater. Do you really think she's just going to change? NO! She's losing her looks fast, and she knows it. She's realizing that getting guys to dump loads in her at 20 is a lot easier than getting one to start a family with her at 29. She's desperate not to die alone, which is why you finally got to fuck her.   Do you really want the mother of your children to have this kind of past? That's fucking gross.  This relationship is doomed! Use her as the unpaid prostitute she actually is until you find a girl who isn't broken and worthless."

Do you want the mother of your children to be a woman who has been savagely defiled like a degenerate slut? Do you want your wife to be a woman who was happy to sleep with men who were married? Do you want your life partner to be someone who spent their formative years making thoughtless choices? Only to decide to settle down with you when she realized her time was up?  When women hit 30 they are done. When men hit 30 they are in their prime - you are physically at your best, you have money, you have experience. Degenerate sluts usually don't have anything but a used up body and need to find a man who is willing to be a cuck for them (not literally perhaps just cuck in the general /pol/ sense).  You don't need to feel bad for questioning your relationship with this women. This is your conscience speaking. Like all human beings, you know what is right and wrong. You know inside that the thought of spending your life with this woman is not something you want to do. My bet is you are only staying with her because you are in lust with her but definitely not in love."

SlutJustice,35qgq0,coon-hunter,11,Wed May 13 08:03:27 2015 UTC,"I know.  :(  It's hard, because you want to be a decent person, and forgive.  That's understandable, and it's a pretty rational impulse, at first blush.  But think of any other habit or lifestyle.  Barring any sort of deep revelation or crisis, people don't generally change.   You're setting yourself up for disaster.   30 is not that old, especially not for a man, and especially not in current society, where marriage is happening later.   Don't sell yourself short."
SlutJustice,35qgq0,refutesstupidnotions,14,Wed May 13 09:40:44 2015 UTC,"Look man, even if she really did change (unlikely) then you will always have to live with the mental image of her gargling the cum of random guys she just met. What if you had kids and they found out? Do you think your daughters would turn out any differently?   Sex with you will never be special to her because of her past hedonism. The bonding that should happen with sex is going to be drowned out in a chorus of remembered grunts and moans of other guys who have already given her those same feelings.  It's like how porn numbs guys to normal monogamous sex. Remember, a woman can get guys to fuck her as easily as a man can find a new porn slut to watch. And the risk of her deciding to do it behind your back one day is very high (past behavior indicates future behavior), just like a porn addicted Redditor will find the convenience of watching porn when he has some free time too much to resist.  If you get attached to this girl, you are asking for heartache. I know ""the past is the past"" is supposed to be the cool laid-back ""sex-positive"" thing to say, but that is bullshit feel-good nonsense. Humans aren't wired that way, and any man who ignores a promiscuous past in his woman is both very weird and very foolish. There's a good reason it bothers you. That is a survival instinct! Guys who never had (or ignored) that gut-twisting anxiety about a slut DON'T HAVE LIVING DESCENDANTS (because they were cucked, and raised another man's children)."

Women are also in large part a reflection of the men they are with. How you handle them will greatly affect how they treat you, and how they behave in general. In a way that means men contribute to sluttery, and they do.   Women are born followers. They want to follow a strong man, and if they don't have one of those, they'll follow some group. A bad man or a bad group can turn an ordinary woman bad. Too bad modern sexual morality has deteriorated into almost nothing."

My whole gripe is the double standard and legal issues that come in to play with relationships nowadays. It's pointless to be in any relationship with a woman (or a friend of any gender) if you cannot trust them because of the litigious society we live in. People are nuts and schemers are galore nowadays. If they don't like you secretly or have a gripe with, they can and will try to screw your life up through any means necessary.  I pray for a real life purge at some point. Even if I don't participate, I would enjoy watching niggers just destroying white-guilted race-traitoring liberals (which comprises a great majority of whores as well). It's hopefully only a matter of time though - I think when the officers get off in the Freddy Gay case then we will see a possible Chimpocolypse. If not, there will still be more tension and hatred towards whitey in general. I pray for the innocents but think that niggers will turn on their close white counterparts and supporters because they will be the first ""melanin deficient"" person in reach that they can take out 'muh slavery struggle' on."

I interpret that rule to include downplaying the consequences of associating with sluts. But it's not just against the rules, it's wrong. Sluts associate with sluts, and they are hostile to chaste/monogamous women because of the implicit slut-shaming in voluntary sexual restraint.

ME: Well, so and so has 3 kids from two different men and lives on government assistance so maybe she should cut back on the relationship advice and focus on getting her life together.  Oddly enough, her friends who are in happy and normal relationships don't have much relationship advice for her, it's always the strong independent womyn who have all of the advice to offer.

There definitely are some decent women doing online dating but they get so much attention that they never feel the need to reach out and find a guy themselves. They just weed through the applicants getting free dinners along the way. The game is setup with males at a severe disadvantage so as a guy you have to have something that sets you above other men.

Everything before the line is just harmless fun ""sexy times"" where there are no consequences just pleasure for which you should never be ashamed. Everything after the line is an unthinkable act of evil.  ""Sex-positive"" is code for degenerate hedonism. If it feels good in the moment, do it. Sex is somehow different than everything else in life, where excess carries consequences. Ignore the exploding bastardy rate, and the societal consequences thereof. Ignore the exploding number of spinsters, and how miserable they are.

My dirtbag husband (also a Redditor) and I decided to take advantage of a struggling marriage by defiling the wife. Teehee. Anyways, I know this is cool because I'm sex-positive, which means I have the morality of an animal. After all, if a marriage requires effort, then it should be destroyed, since it is disposable (like families). Enough about trivialities, let's get to the real point: my surprise when my degeneracy didn't feel good! After we had coaxed another man's wife into a night of bisexual adultery and defilement, my husband and the newly-minted slut had fun sexy times without me! Why does this hurt? Sex is nothing but good feels, so why are my feels so bad?  Redditors, in unison: Well, first m'lady, let me euphorically assure you that you've done nothing morally wrong. You just messed up the technical part of hedonism. See, if only you'd had a conversation with your husband about boundaries then everything would be peachy! The only minor moral issues are with your husband continuing to defile another man's wife without you, without confirming that you were cool with it, but he was probably just interpreting your debauchery the night before as a sign that you were ok with him doing the exact same thing the next morning. And the fact that the other woman was married, which we won't harp on, but there may be a moral gray area there (doesn't matter, had sex).  these people are barely able to be called people"

SlutJustice,31d1bk,-Slutlord-Fascist-,10,Fri Apr 3 22:35:39 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to wrap my head around this idea that you'd commit to a woman who didn't enjoy sex with you. Obviously, it's because she ain't attracted, but that isn't even the point. So what if she doesn't like giving head? That's her fucking problem, not the man's. Leave that woman in the bargain bin and find one that isn't broken."
SlutJustice,31d1bk,isthatyourdaughter,3,Fri Apr 3 23:27:28 2015 UTC,"These are obvious things but she gives head to everyone but him.  Which, by definition, makes her a bitch.  And a liar."

SlutJustice,317ghr,-Slutlord-Fascist-,26,Thu Apr 2 16:27:00 2015 UTC,"To make things worse I am older than these girls, not in the best shape of my life, and I can't stop internalizing that comment as a reflection of my own body. I've had dysmorphia issues in the past and can feel my disordered eating habits creeping back up.    wow turns out men like young pretty girls not fat old whores  SHOCK ALMOST AS IF MARRIAGE EXISTS TO PREVENT THIS BEHAVIOR"
SlutJustice,317ghr,Speed__Racist,7,Thu Apr 2 16:28:04 2015 UTC,"I've had dysmorphia issues in the past and can feel my disordered eating habits creeping back up.   Good.  Maybe if you fucking starved yourself, you would be attractive.  You're fat.  It's not going to kill you to not eat.  You could go quite a while with nothing but water and still be fine.   SHOCK ALMOST AS IF MARRIAGE EXISTS TO PREVENT THIS BEHAVIOR   Marriage traditionally existed such that the husband gets exclusive access to his wife.  He'd lots of pussy from her.  And more to the point, up until the last thirty years most women weren't hamplanets even though they gained weight, so they were quite drillable in their husband's eyes even when they were old.   Until recently, taking care of your body and not weighing 600 pounds was a normal expectation in a relationship.  What OP wants to do is the polar opposite.  She probably envisioned a poly relationship as her riding the cock carousel while he gets nothing, because it's usually easier for women to get takers than men."
SlutJustice,317ghr,Saturnine83,13,Fri Apr 3 19:21:39 2015 UTC,"This woman is like a male beta fag trapped in a fat girl's body. Sounds like the whining of a beta provider coming to the realization that he's being played for a fool by a woman with a higher SMV than him. It's not often you hear about it working the other way around.   To make things worse, they had anal sex, which I understood we only did with each other & considered our biggest real boundary.   Anal sex is where she draws the line... I'm beyond words. So the poop chute is off limits but the hole with reproductive properties is just fine?   Any thoughts on this situation and how to internalize it?   Here's an idea... polygamy doesn't work. People are naturally possessive over their partners and for good reason. The human ego cannot handle infidelity. Men are not psychologically suited to accept a woman with a promiscuous past. Women are not psychologically suited to deal with a man who pays attention and affection to other women. It doesn't fucking work.  How does this woman not realize that she is dating out of her league? If the man is able to attract more partners than the woman then the difference in attractiveness has got to be massive. Like an 8/10 dude with a 4/10 woman. I'm guessing she is the provider in the relationship. What an absolute moron. She doesn't realize that she is just part of this guy's harem, not his actual partner."
SlutJustice,317ghr,Speed__Racist,8,Fri Apr 3 15:23:14 2015 UTC,"Men are not psychologically suited to accept a woman with a promiscuous past. Women are not psychologically suited to deal with a man who pays attention and affection to other women. I   It's an often-overlooked point.  Men are more emotionally disturbed by thinking of their partner being penetrated by other dicks, whereas women are more emotionally disturbed by thinking of their partner being in love with someone else--they are less disturbed by their husband loving them and giving them money but fucking whores on the side than their husband would be in the reverse situation.   To make things worse, they had anal sex, which I understood we only did with each other & considered our biggest real boundary.   It's a fatty's anus.  Let that sink in.  It probably has a very foul smell and is never cleaned.  But she thinks it's unreasonable that he would have anal sex with someone else instead.   How does this woman not realize that she is dating out of her league? If the man is able to attract more partners than the woman then the difference in attractiveness has got to be massive. Like an 8/10 dude with a 4/10 woman.   Truest comment in the thread."
SlutJustice,317ghr,Speed__Racist,8,Fri Apr 3 19:27:10 2015 UTC,"During our year together we've been exclusively poly (never monogamous), usually with a lot of fun and success, but in December he cheated on me by continuing to have a physical relationship with someone who disrespected me on multiple occasions in his presence - he didn't jump to my defense in that situation, but did say later he would stop his physical relationship with her.    If the genders were reversed and it were a hot buff guy disrespecting her husband in her presence, I bet she'd be totally cool with that.  Just like how Zoe Quinn, who accused her boyfriend constantly of cheating to the point of being emotionally abusive, was the very one who was cucking her boyfriend and having sex with everyone but him."

SlutJustice,317ghr,BustaHymes,6,Wed Apr 8 20:40:02 2015 UTC,"HAHAHAHA this story warms my heart. This fat poly whore is getting exactly what every poly degenerate will get eventually: misery.   I've had dysmorphia issues in the past and can feel my disordered eating habits creeping back up.   I hope, for her sake, this means she'll become thin. Because seriously guys don't want fat chicks. And being a poly whore isn't going to score her any points when she wants a family."

I doubt she was ever actually anorexic--anorexics have a smart, OCD, disciplined personality, fatties are the opposite.  This is probably why so few niggers and spics ever become anorexic.  What she calls ""disordered thoughts"" is just her trying to suppress the normal disgust you feel when your body looks disgustingly unhealthy."
SlutJustice,317ecg,-Slutlord-Fascist-,6,Thu Apr 2 16:10:45 2015 UTC,"This is almost too exact of a portrayal of an alpha widow to be true.   I really don't want posts calling me a homewrecker etc. because I'm very aware how horrible I was/am.   Oh I'm sure you don't. That might hurt your delicate feelings.   Someone that can do this to the girlfriend multiple times (and God knows with how many other people) is a horrible person, end of story.   Anyone who has sex with a person with the foreknowledge that that person is in a relationship is also a horrible person. I love how she has convinced herself that this is all his fault.   Every time I see him, my heart drops out of my ass.   I do not envy a man who is so attractive that he causes incontinence in the women around him.   I literally cannot get him out of my head. I feel like I'm going crazy. I know I can't be the only one in the history of feelings to have this happen to them.   This is how pair-bonding works for females. She will continue to obsess over him until she pair-bonds with a male of higher SMV. That is unlikely to happen so she'll probably just hit the wall, secure a provider, and live out the rest of her days as an alpha widow. The poor future husband of hers will likely never know that he'll always be a distant second in her mind and that she'd throw his years of commitment and emotional/financial support in the trash in an instant if her old flame came back around.  This is why the healthiest relationship is one where the woman waits until marriage to pair-bond. Alpha widows cannot be saved and will never truly love again. Their SMV may remain high but the quality of relationship they can provide for any other partner for the rest of lives will be shitty at best."

SlutJustice,30v0v5,-Slutlord-Fascist-,11,Mon Mar 30 22:53:36 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Really like my friend with benefits. He gave signs of liking me too, but said he wasn't ready for a LDR. Last week, got drunk and freaked out and made it look like I wasn't okay with not being serious, he said we should end it. I don't want to end it. How do I proceed?   he's gonna marry me some day   See, I would be inclined to agree, but his actions have always shown me that he does care, even if it's just as friends rather than as a romantic partner. He made my favorite meal for my birthday. I texted him complaining about this douchebag I know who said something rude, and he left me a long voicemail telling me ""don't listen to him, you're great, he's a dick, etc."" At our banquet, he noticed I was feeling uncomfortable where I was sitting, so he got me, took some pictures with me, and allowed me to sit with him and his friends, introducing me to them and saying ""isn't she gorgeous?"" etc. He texts me out of the blue to ask how I am, or calls me for no reason.  Our fling was based on mutual sexual attraction, but it developed into a great friendship. Maybe he is a player. But if he really didn't care about me and only wanted sex, there would be plenty of easier ways to go about it. I once dated a guy that did only see me as a casual rebound, and I could tell the difference because we only ever talked about sex, and afterward he left as quickly as possible. He also talked about his other dates.  We went for almost four months without even seeing each other, but still talked every day. Yes, I can understand doing kind gestures to win someone over so they'll sleep with you. I just feel like if he was really just into sex, he would find someone who didn't live two hours away and can only see him sporadically. And he brought up that he didn't want any other girls on his own. I never insisted on that rule, because I knew it wouldn't be fair to demand that if we weren't dating. It just seems like a lot of unnecessary work. Sure, maybe it says something about him that he isn't willing to commit, but I feel like he at least cares about me as a person.   he really does care guys  guys  he cares"

LOL degenerate redditors and their crazy ideas. I'm older than he is and if my wife died, today I'd be looking for a woman as young (and chaste, and thin) as possible to marry. Marry a single woman over 30? LOL, not unless she was born with a dick-odometer.  HE DIDNT ""TRICK HER."" This pozzed western attitude toward sexuality deluded her BEFORE SHE EVER MET HIM. She's been taught that handing out pussy without securing commitment is a reasonable thing to do and feels good with absolutely no psychological consequences.   It always makes me sad that women are lied to their whole lives, and then make bad decisions for themselves. They're irrational and easily manipulated, and no woman should be making serious decisions without a father or husband's guidance. I feel sad for her, but not sad enough to let it stop me from shaming her. Other women need to see the consequences of slutting.  Slut-Shaming saves lives.
