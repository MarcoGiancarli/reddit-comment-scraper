I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the navy waffles, I am very random and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on neopets top guilds, and I have over 300 confirmed toodles. I have trained in maple syrup bisexual combat and I am top alien on invader zim 64. you are nothing to me but another pancake. I will call you names out with precision been seen on this blag, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away saying that to me over the internet? Think again, pooper. as we speak I am contacting my secret network of preteen girls across myspace, and they are all very bisexual. your IP adress is being traced, so you better prepare for the storm, toodles. the storm that splorks that pathetic little thing you call your pumpkin. you think you're random, kid? I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare randomness. Not only am I extensively trained in waffle combat, but I have access to then entire arsenal of the Club Pengouin Army of DOOOOOOMMMM and I will use it to it's full extent to spread your miserable peanut butter from the surface of this toast, you little poop. if only you could have known what tasty retributioon your little ""random"" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking toaster. But you couldn't, you didn't and now your paying the price, you goddamn imatture hater. I will toast waffles all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, toodles."
blunderyears,3djsn6,UberDave_141,71,Thu Jul 16 23:49:48 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. You said a ""spork is random.""  Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a scientist who studies sporks, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls sporks random. If you want to be ""random"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""spork family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Untensildae, which includes things from spoons to forks to knives.  So your reasoning for calling a spork random is because random people say ""sporks are totally random!"" Let's get Trongs and popcorn forks in there, then, too.  Also, calling Naruto a TV Show or an anime? It's not one or the other, that's not how stuff works. They're both. A spork is a spork and a member of the random family. But that's not what you said. You said a spork is random, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the spork family random, which means you'd call spoons, kinves, and forks random, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

blunderyears,3djsn6,t3hcoolness,38,Fri Jul 17 01:43:44 2015 UTC,"OK, so whenever someone mentions a spork, there is a copy pasta called the penguin of doom. The copy pasta includes the line ""holds up spork"". For some odd reason, sporks are related to cringy "" randomness"" and the penguin of doom.  This usually causes someone to comment the pasta in it's entirety (probably has already happened). This happened every time someone mentions a spork. As a result, the joke ""don't anyone comment it"" has arose as its own joke.  There are also a lot of versions and variations of the copy pasta due to it's popularity."

He also does the voice of Billy from The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, the voice of Alpha from the original Power Ranger (ayeyayaye), the voice of Razputin from Psychonauts, and two Yordles in League of Legends. He's probably in a ton of other things, but these are the ones that I noticed.  BTW if you are into voice actor you should check out this documentary.  http://www.iknowthatvoice.com/"

If they're serious about it and the type of person who doesn't want to trouble their loved ones, it's unlikely she would have told you.

She was always there for me but never told me when she felt the same way :( she talked me down a hundred times and I couldn't even return the favor once. She told no one it was something she struggled with. Don't blame yourself. You made her happy while she was here."

IMO 2001 was still the same fashion era. That post-grunge/Tarantino-loving/ravers/Big collars/Bleached-hair era. Things started to change around 2002, when The Strokes happened, with their skinny jeans look, and emos started to appear in the mainstream.  Thanks for the post!"

blunderyears,3dc3mb,yosoymilk5,3,Wed Jul 15 20:00:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sorry I wish I had a picture of myself wearing it. That's why I thought it fit better with cringe pics and not here.  However, I wore camo cargo shorts with it. Luckily, I was conscientious about myself enough to not wear wristbands or fingerless gloves; but, that doesn't really make me wearing this any better. It's a metal band shirt, as well. Says ""Veil of Fucking Maya"" on the front, adding to the cringe of it."

We wore hockey gear to feed him and I'm pretty sure he's in isis now.   Sly ended up getting sold to another family as my brother was becoming more and more tied up with being a dad. This was 20 years ago. Hopefully that snake's okay somewhere.

Then I neglected them and they disintegrated. Sad, because now, as an adult.. I love butterflies again, and have been raising caterpillars-   Anyways, totally not a blunder!

I see lots of other butterflies around (tiger swallowtails, giant swallowtails, sulphers, and cabbage whites) but I haven't found any of them on their food source naturally. I do thoroughly enjoy it though!"
blunderyears,3c8mja,TaylorS1986,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:50:30 2015 UTC,"That's awesome. Do you still have them? Did you catch them all? Are they still alive when you pin them? I know literally nothing about this hobby.  Also, now I'm totally curious how different blades work. I remember the only science fair-like thing I ever did in school was more of an ""invent something"" fair... I ""invented"" clothing labels for blind people. I lost, which was ok, but I lost to a girl who made a bowl with holes in it so unpopped kernels of popcorn would sift out. Still a lot of resentment about that."
blunderyears,3c8mja,DarkFriendX,6,Mon Jul 6 04:31:23 2015 UTC,"No, I don't still have these.  I didn't know how to properly take care of them and small insects came and ate the whole collection.  They should be stored in a sealed container with moth balls for at least minimal protection.    I would catch them with a homemade net and then put them in the freezer to kill them.  After that I would spread the wings and let them dry.  I had found some books on insect collecting at the library and it fascinated me.    Re, science fair, I won and took second at the district fair.  Blades play a role, but in my case not as much as other factors of the design.   I did all the construction myself though so I guess the judges cut me some slack.  I just helped my son with his first science fair project a few weeks ago and it brought back a lot of fun memories of working on mine.  I spent about 4 months on mine."
blunderyears,3c8mja,jasper976,2,Mon Jul 6 05:51:47 2015 UTC,"I love that, coming around full circle like that. Plus, a million bonus points for encouraging science. I always wished I'd been pushed more back in school when I was easily intimidated by math and therefore all things math related. I'm just now learning basic silly things and it's more exciting than it should be :)  Good luck at the science fair!"
