WastelandPowers,3e4dnq,Mysterious_Drifter,3,Tue Jul 21 22:14:41 2015 UTC,"That could work, but I'd probably have to scale mah congress down to a small(ish) amount of people, just so I don't have to spend hours randomizing names and such.  I'll give it a shot, though.  Thank you!"

WastelandPowers,3e4dnq,Darndello,2,Tue Jul 21 22:53:36 2015 UTC,"My system is a little different, but I think what I do might give you some inspiration. My country is governed day to day by the Sublime Quorum, a group of nine (called Eoses), the most experienced in certain relevant matters (industry, war etc.) Every tech and event post I've written for the last while has been either in the form of a discussion in the Sublime Quorum, where the topic of the post is proposed, argued for by the appropriate Eos, and usual disputed by some others, or in the form of a demonstration for the Sublime Quorum, which they then discuss. This allows me to develop individual characters rather than have this faceless country, lets me demonstrate my unique government system, and lets me drop in some lore every now and then.  Take a look at some of my posts, they might give you some ideas. Warning: they're terrible writing, but they might help you out."

Quorum at Punataiya:  Any settlements that we find that wish to have a Quorum will be aided in doing so. The natural progression from this is to add the Quorum to the Grand Quorum, making them an official part of Nullica. This is all done voluntarily by the locals. We will continue this practice by allowing any further settlements that wish to join us to do so. The only people that we have encountered that are interested in this in Indonesia, and have not yet done so, are the other settlements in Sulawesi. Sulawesi is over one thousand kilometres from any of the land of the Empire, but we will try to avoid stepping on the very long tail of the tiger again."
