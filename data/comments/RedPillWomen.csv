I will not nag him into doing anything (never been my thing as I hate being nagged myself :) ) I was just thinking it'd be kinda nice to do some of the ""work"" together, if that makes sense?"
RedPillWomen,3e2e51,cats_or_get_out,16,Tue Jul 21 13:47:46 2015 UTC,"I don't want to change him.   Yes, you do.  You want to make him alpha. You want him to workout more.  You want him to stop smoking.  You want him to work with you on this.  See? This is about you.  Not him. (You can't change another person.  Tell yourself that 100 times...those are your Hail Marys for today)  Let go.  Relinquish that control.  Stop hoping you'll ""lead him to change.""  You can't make his frame for him.     Even if he stays beta, so what?  Look, you're a married woman.  Live up to that commitment.  Love him wholly and completely.    Stop reacting and justifying. Be calm. Be loving.

He has other things on his mind. Why should he spend the time and energy picking out a menu, that's my job. Do you know what foods he likes? Do you know what foods he dislikes? Great - you know enough to handle dinner yourself. If he makes a suggestion then you comply to the best of your abilities.    how can I gently encourage him to be more alpha, less beta and more proactive about his health (he's a smoker who needs to exercise - not overweight but needs to move - not criticism, just concerned)   You don't - You support him if he starts to make the change, but you don't push him. Get yourself into a good routine FIRST. Does he express the want to quit smoking, does he express the want to lose weight? If he doesn't any supportive push will come across as nagging. Now, if he does express the want to quit smoking/lose weight then you just have to ask him to join you in a nightly walk after dinner, shop healthier, cook healthier. Smoking, from what I understand, is one of the hardest addictions to quit. So you have to let him do it at his pace - if he even wants to."

Are you me?  I had to make the conscious choice to sit back and realize that he doesn't need the stress of what's for dinner.  I'll ask him approximately how many calories he wants for dinner or if he wants a light or heavy meal and make something accordingly.  If he wants something in particular, he'll tell me.  Otherwise, I just make food."

Sometimes I'll ask if he has a particular craving (and if he does make a request it's almost always for stir fry noodles), or I'll just let him know ""I'm thinking of cooking _____ tonight"" and see if he has any objections. But making the menu is part of the tasks delegated to me. I'm the one who does the grocery shopping and knows what ingredients are in the fridge and what should be cooked while freshest. He doesn't want to have to keep track of these things. Especially when his brain is off and he's in caveman hungry mode."
RedPillWomen,3e2e51,antariusz,6,Wed Jul 22 07:21:55 2015 UTC,Just a quick question.  Why do you want him to be more alpha and less beta?
RedPillWomen,3e2e51,TheTerrorSquad,3,Tue Jul 21 16:38:35 2015 UTC,"It's all right in the original post.  Married 7 years.  No longer aroused by husband. She tried ""negotiating desire"" by having sex with him because she read (in trp no less) that it would save her marriage. She tried it for 2 months, but it isn't working, because she isn't as attracted to him as she used to be. She is trying to ""fake it till she makes it""...   And now she is wondering when she will start actually enjoying the sex she is now having."
RedPillWomen,3e2e51,Disappear_vanish,2,Tue Jul 21 20:32:31 2015 UTC,That doesn't exactly answer my question. I'm just wondering what she dislikes about his beta behaviour and what she thinks she'll like about him being more alpha.    Beta does not necessarily mean bad and alpha does not necessarily mean good.    It sounds like SHE wants these things.  Emphasis on her not him.
RedPillWomen,3e2e51,iamz3ro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:40:56 2015 UTC,"Ok, I agree there is nothing wrong with beta.  Except when its against someone's nature.  You know what it feels like to go against your own instinct? Not good.  That's why I like the idea and reality of him being more alpha.  He is much happier, and that is awesome.  He is being truer to himself when he is displaying those traits, than when he burries them."
RedPillWomen,3e2e51,nspikeu,2,Wed Jul 22 00:07:51 2015 UTC,Naught to do with sex actually. Since going for it each night my drive now matches his (my drive went awol after two miscarriages btw). So no complaints there.
RedPillWomen,3e2e51,KatherineKelly,2,Wed Jul 22 00:05:14 2015 UTC,"Because when he is more assertive, he is happier.  When he is more confident, he is happier.  When he just says what he wants without worrying, he is happier.  When he's happy, the house is happy and warm and loving. Then he steps back again.  And up til recently I thought I was supposed to step up and fill the gap, so to speak.  So now I need to learn to let go, the gap be there and just keep doing my part (I think?)"
RedPillWomen,3e2e51,stolidfact,6,Tue Jul 21 23:53:52 2015 UTC,"This is not about you. You're seeing life through lenses he might not have right now. This perfect relationship you want to have is like a magnificent skyscraper in the distance. It wasn't built overnight, and it's not a kindergarten Lego project. It's complicated and requires significant investment, and the building you're looking at is invisible to him, so describing it to him isn't going to do anything productive but will frustrate him.   Make these changes yourself. Turn yourself into a submissive,RP wife and that will water the seeds for alpha behavior that he already has planted.   This isn't about you. Get off the whole, ""ideally he would be alpha by this date"" or ""these are behaviors of an alpha man that I want him to have."" You've done these, made these stipulations in your head and you're shoving and goading him, and you know it. None of that is helpful, it's just whitewashing the same old controlling and demanding behavior and pretending it's supportive and motivating.   . He's never going to live up to your expectations because if he does behave more like an alpha, he won't be focusing on your happiness anyway, and that's where it all starts. Because it's not really about you.   If you really want to be happy you need to understand that he can't have that as his goal at all. He isn't your puppet. You can never change him. You can get your foot off of his throat, though. Someone else here said you need to get out of his way and it's true. All of your post is asking what you can get him to do now and the answer is nothing.   Are you as hot and sweet as you can possibly be right now? Work on that. How many dishes can you cook from scratch and how many nights a week do you do it? Work on that. Got a habit of letting the dishes pileup before you do them? Work on that. You want an alpha, but you need to deserve one. Just because you're married to him doesn't mean you don't still have to attract an alpha. If you met your husband tomorrow and he was your dream alpha, would he still want you like you are now?   On the smoking: does he know you'd prefer if he quit? Probably does  right? So then do not, under any circumstances, hound him about this again. Don't bring it up. Don't make a face when he lights a cig, don't make passive aggressive concerned bullshit comments about his health because I promise he knows, and if he is running low, go get him a pack to save him the trip to the store. Fill his gas tank while your there and get him a pop he likes. Don't bitch about any of his habits to anyone, ever. These are things you can do starting now.   This is not about you. If he was your dream alpha except for this tobacco habit, would you walk away from your first date, looking just like you do now, saying, ""ew, that's a deal breaker?"" Now cycle through this thought process with each of these habits or traits he has that you don't like. If he was AB and perfect except for ____, would I still want him?   It will take time for him to see all your changes and to trust them. He's deflated and defeated and probably cynical about your recent changes. Give him a year, two years. How many years have you spent together not at the top of your game? Give him that many of your best.    And of course, you need to know that depending on how unattractive you've gotten physically and how big of a bitch and a nag you've been, he may already be totally checked out. Probably not, but be fair. You'll know in your gut if he just needs to be done.  Edit: Woah, this reads like I'm totally telling you off, girl. I'm not. There's no anger or I'll-will here, just frankness."

He's said he wants to stop smoking. He says it about once a month and has done for several years.  I do not know how much more supportive I can be on that one (have done the requested research on alternatives, hypnotherapy etc).  I never nag, as I know that tends to have an opposite effect on people, plus its just not fun to nag anyhow. I own my happiness, he owns his. This is a fact I get.  Am I not supposed to care if he is happy and healthy though? :) on the cooking I do ALL cooking and have done since day one of cohabitation. He chooses the dinners for the fortnight and lets me play the rest.  It works beautifully, that was the third change I made a few months ago. I don't have a deadline.  I just know from our relationship history that he is insinctively alpha, and his upbringing messed that up.  We have had a rocky few years and during that time, he's reverted to his upbringing and I 'stepped in' to fill the gap.  I know now that was wrong, but I thought that was what I was supposed to do (I've been hung up on the wrong supposed to's, I know this know, it does take a little time to adjust thought) I guess I didn't think of it as getting him to do what I want, but how to help him be the bestest he is by nature."

I was a bit worried it would be over the top, but it was really practical. It has alot of real life examples on how to relinquish control and why. It's a simple, pragmatic book.   Anyone can follow the steps. It also showed some ways men react or feel if treated dissrespectfully or if controlled. I was trying hard before, but I never really got it.   I was desparing in the first chapters on how horrible I had been in some areas, but in the later ones I saw ways I had been successful, and proof in his actions. It was both prodding and encouraging, I do reccomend it, because as others have said, you are still trying to change him, and that isn't the goal."

Other than minor tidying, cooking, and things that are unavoidably day-to-day: you should not be focusing on keeping house when he gets home. When he gets home, the focus should be on spending time together and helping him to unwind.   Be ready to greet him when he gets home. There is nothing worse than coming home to be mildly ignored. Chances are he will be exhausted and want to relax, so exude that energy. Be calming and soothing, listen instead of yammer on about yourself.  Anticipate his needs, have the groceries you need for meals you will be making him. Pre-make snacks, and do food prep so that you can focus your energies on his needs as much as possible.   It's going to be difficult, and it will take a lot of energy and effort to support him fully and selflessly during this time.

Drop them off fresh on a simple, nice serving plate. NOT TUPPERWARE. Even if he never sees your face because you've only got time to swing in, dump the goods, and speed to work/wherever, it's a practical ""I love you"" at his convenience. He will know they're from you.  I wake up practically in the middle of the night to bake things for my man to have at the office. Let me tell you, he wakes up at 5am to a house that already smells like oatmeal raisin cookies, his day is off to a fantastic start. The smell of baking is as good as the taste. Believe me.   Make bread. It's so simple, fast, and an enormous comfort. I give my husband bread at work all the time and all the guys are always asking when I'll send more loaves in. I usually drop them off warm wrapped in brown paper so they don't get soggy. I can give you a recipe that yields 2-3 loaves and takes 2-2 1/2 hours start to finish with about 10 of those minutes being hands on if you're interested, no there's no kneading. But girl, cook! Bring him hot homemade meals every chance you get.   He's going to be working hundred hour weeks. This doesn't mean you will have a hundred hours a week worth of support to lend. You may, and you may not but wish you did. Either way, be a soft spot for him to land at the end of the day. Being dressed and made up when he drags himself in very late or while he's holed up on his home office still count, but he'll probably never mention it.   And sex. He's going to be living at the office, so you know this means you have a perfect opportunity to make it a more pleasant work environment for him. Find a slow time for him and visit wearing slutty lingerie and belted trench coat is practically required at least once, right?   Sexting and nudes may or may not be your thing, but everyone likes humor. Send him silly things or funny things occasionally. Any way to lighten the mood in ways that don't distract him. You're his fun, sweet, happy gal.   Kiss him hello and goodby every single day. Every. Single. Day.   It's going to be hard to watch him have bad days and bad weeks. There's little you can do in some situations. He took this on because he has a dream he wants to make real. He chose the hard work, he set his jaw, and he's going to be a better man on the other side of it. Sounds like you have a great and driven man in your life. This is a great opportunity for him.   Edit: bread.  5-6 cups flour  1.5 tbs yeast  1.5 tbs salt  3 cups water  If you have a thermometer, make the water 100-105 degrees. If no thermo., just kinda warm. Not too hot, it kills the yeast. Kind of like warm bath water. If it feels almost the same temp as your hand it's probably good.   Put the water and the salt in a large bowl and stir. Add the yeast and stir a few laps around the bowl is good. Cover for 5 minutes or so with plastic wrap (loosely)  or a kitchen towel. After 5 minutes (or ten or fifteen or however long because I occasionally get busy and forget!) add 5 cups of flour and mix with a spoon or fork until a loose, very sticky dough forms. It doesn't take long, just get the pockets of flour mixed in.   Put the plastic wrap or towel back over it and wait about an hour or 90 minutes.   Preheat the oven to 450. Spray a bread pan with cooking spray and scoop about half of the dough into it in a relatively uniform-shaped log. Bake at 450 for 25-30 minutes uncovered. Dump out of pan immediately. It's going to be hotter than the sun for about 15 minutes. These keep well on the counter unwrapped. If you cut a chunk off, put the open/cut end down on a cutting board or plate or whatever and slip a paper lunch bag over it."

Presentation makes food taste better to the people eating it.  When I have guests, I wouldn't bring out the dessert in plastic with lids or what have you. Everything gets served on the proper dish. My thought is that even if the food is leaving the house, I still want it to look good. I want to put my best forward, and my best is not, ""Ehh, these cookies are cooled, I'll dump them in this ziplock or glad ware."" My best is a plain clear serving dish (I actually have a dedicated plate for this bc I do it so frequently) for cookies or bars, napkins for next to the tray, and small ziplock bags for the folks who want to take a few away with them.    If the food won't all get eaten or taken, which hasn't happened yet, then there are bags for easier transport on the way back.

RedPillWomen,3d9jft,SuperSlavisWife,9,Sun Jul 19 17:13:07 2015 UTC,"As someone who has put in the 100+ hour weeks to build something for family, I am really heartened to see this kind of pre-emptive effort.  It will really go a long way.  I want to address potential pitfalls you should keep in mind.  Remember some TRP basics which may or may not apply in your case (and for which you might not need a reminder): just because he doesn't spend as much time with you doesn't mean you should feel neglected.  If you are feeling like you need more attention, schedule it so you get it from him (rather than anyone else) even if you have to wait.  The usual.  Finally.  I can tell you that all hours are not created equal.  Ramping up from 40 to 60 a week is relatively easy.  60 to 80 takes some planning and reourcefulness.  80 to 100 takes a determined effort and regular assessment to ensure home life, health and wellness needs are met.  100+ for an ongoing period is challenging to say the least and I would be surprised if there are not teething problems on the way.  For your part, if you see red flags, point them out in a matter of fact way and let him decide how to deal.  There is no need to sugarcoat any issues you see but no need to dwell.  Some of the best advice is already in this thread.  Just straight up ask what you can do to help.  It goes without saying that when you are able to snatch a few minutes together you should snuggle up and keep your physical bond as strong as possible.  Good luck and again it is heartening to see this kind of support for a family effort."
RedPillWomen,3d9jft,FuzzyKittenIsFuzzy,4,Tue Jul 14 18:08:27 2015 UTC,"So glad to see your perspective, thank you. I know he's working hard for Us, so I want to work hard to make it easier on him. My big fear is home becoming a burden after such a long work day - so I try to make every night feel like vacation as much as possible."
RedPillWomen,3d9hza,Rollo-Tomassi,8,Tue Jul 14 15:33:29 2015 UTC,"the debate as to whether women have the same moral agency or the same accountability for it as men.   Of course.  Women made demands. They changed definitions.  Men allowed these changes to take place.    We are all responsible.     In my own estimate Hypergamy isn’t inherently bad or good – it just depends on whether you find yourself on the sharp end of it.   Hypergamy is amoral.  However, what women do with hypergamy can be determined as good or bad by society.     but are we presuming our concept of justice is one that’s universally common to that of women?   Yes, as it is men who came up with and normalized the concepts of honor and justice (They are inherently masculine concepts that women might be able to learn, but they aren't inherently feminine).  The definition of justice is basically just behavior or treatment.  Woman don't really have a standard definition of what just behavior is because it only applies to her feelings.  This is something that cannot be defined concretely because a woman will define it in impossible terms, i.e. a sensitive yet confident alpha man.  Which basically boils down to give me the feelings I want when I want them.  This is a woman's definition of masculinity, at least today.     Along with that unprecedented control comes the prioritizing of women’s concept of justice above that of men’s.   What you refer to as women's concept of justice is not just behavior or treatment.  It is about power.  Not morality.  Power and justice are not comparable ideas."
RedPillWomen,3d9hza,StingrayVC,4,Tue Jul 14 16:41:01 2015 UTC,Woman don't really have a standard definition of what just behavior is because it only applies to her feelings.   I would argue that the just behavior predicated on 'feelings' will always default to whatever best optimizes women's Hypergamous impulses.
RedPillWomen,3d9hza,StingrayVC,9,Tue Jul 14 16:59:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course.  But that doesn't make it ""just"" or fair.  That would imply consistency in the definition.  Women don't want consistent laws, they want laws that will give them the power to do what they want.  Which we overwhelmingly now have and continue to get.  But we cannot call this a woman's definition of ""just'.  Because it's not about fairness or morality.  It is about power."
RedPillWomen,3d9hza,katiemonster,3,Tue Jul 14 17:13:37 2015 UTC,"Although, to be fair, women who support these laws (i.e. feminists) would call them ""just."" So it's not completely off base to refer to that as a ""woman's concept of justice.""  You're absolutely right about the underlying motivations, though."
RedPillWomen,3d9hza,StingrayVC,5,Tue Jul 14 18:09:31 2015 UTC,Feminists would call a lion a mouse if it would get them what they want.  The underlying motivations are all we can look at to begin to understand what is going on.  Not the words the feminists use.    Definitions mean nothing to them.
RedPillWomen,3d9hza,katiemonster,2,Tue Jul 14 19:14:04 2015 UTC,"True. A lot of them do believe what they're saying, though."
RedPillWomen,3d9hza,StingrayVC,2,Tue Jul 14 19:27:21 2015 UTC,Yes.  Some believe they are squirrels.  Believing it doesn't make it true.
RedPillWomen,3d26xm,Im_Justin_Cider,29,Sun Jul 12 22:43:10 2015 UTC,"When we have been wounded by significant others we than turn to others we try to ""make significant"" to repair the past wounds with. It is difficult to heal a wound using the same tool that first caused it. It would be like shooting yourself to repair the first bullet wound. It is called ""repeating the trauma to make it less traumatic"" but all it does is add drama and trauma to ones life.  A man will not repair self esteem issues and if anything he makes her more vulnerable to these issues. It becomes an act of trying to force someone to love her because  deep down she feels unlovable from the lack of love in ones past (abuse) so she uses her body as an enticement and or sex as a distraction to fill the emptiness of her heart and life.  I think this is why many people have children to get the love they did not get as children but in this loveless fog they do not see that a child is incapable of filling this void because of their own needs they must fill.  She is using sex get attention and calling it love as a emotional healing salve to fill the void of emptiness that her sense of having no value (loveless) creates. She is caught in a perpetual loop of using people to fix the damage other people have created.  The only way to stop this  cycle is to stand on her own emotional feet that she creates by becoming ""for herself"" the healthy parent she never had. She must invest in herself as the respect she cultivates in herself by the care she shows for herself as to her body, mind and soul  Until she sees that she has value and this value must be protected and nurtured she will never escape the prison of self loathing that her family has placed her in.  Love for another is something that happens after one recognizes that all of life has value and each person is part of this.  You cannot know the experience of love if you believe yourself to be inferior or superior to another because one comes out fear and the other out of ignorance and neither allows for the understanding and experiencing of what love truly is.  She does what she does because she does not understand the meaning or experience of genuine love for herself."
RedPillWomen,3d26xm,KatherineKelly,7,Sun Jul 12 23:54:40 2015 UTC,Exactly. No relationship will ever make anybody happy unless the person is happy inside out already.
RedPillWomen,3d26xm,Pink_acetaminophen,-3,Mon Jul 13 02:00:48 2015 UTC,Why would a woman fuck three men within 24hrs? She must enjoy it.i thought women were serial monogamous and more discriminate than men
RedPillWomen,3d26xm,j-coordinate,3,Wed Jul 15 19:34:21 2015 UTC,Same reason someone would eat three whole cakes within 24 hours?
RedPillWomen,3d26xm,NittanyLioness84,9,Thu Jul 16 17:28:01 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't think it's ever too late for anyone unless they are on their deathbed. But I prefer to think positive :)  If SHE (not you, or her therapist, but herself) truly wants to make changes then she can do it. I would encourage her to be honest and forthcoming about her past. Doesn't need to go into dirty details or anything, but lying/hiding is the fastest way to lose trust and respect. She also needs to manage her expectations. Some guys are not going to be okay with her past and that is their prerogative. I would bet if she is attractive, steps up her girl game, and gets her act together then she could find a quality guy. The same quality that a hot 25 year old with a clean past could get? No, but still quality.   Good luck to your friend, sounds like she has a good friend in you!"
RedPillWomen,3d26xm,sugarcrush,17,Mon Jul 13 01:47:25 2015 UTC,I think she needs to take accountability for her mental health and get professional help. No high quality man in his 30s is going to want someone with issues.

RedPillWomen,3d26xm,NittanyLioness84,4,Sun Jul 12 23:07:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she needs to fix whatever is going on in her life before even bothering with dating."
RedPillWomen,3d26xm,mannishwood,6,Sun Jul 12 23:22:32 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to hear she's going to therapy. However, as a 30+ RPW who has given up on finding a partner because of my past, sometimes that's just life. Nobody is automatically entitled to love and happiness; for some people it just doesn't happen. All you can do is be a good friend to her and avoid giving her false hope."
RedPillWomen,3d26xm,vintagegirlgame,7,Mon Jul 13 13:54:19 2015 UTC,Why have you given up completely?  I don't think it's ever too late if the person decides and follows through with making a serious change in priorities and lifestyle.
RedPillWomen,3d26xm,mannishwood,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:31:59 2015 UTC,"Why would any man want to be with me when he could have a 22 year old? I've internalised RP truths about men and women and sexuality and made my peace with what the rest of my life is going to be. I'm very sad that I'll never have children, but I'd rather face my future honestly and without delusions that cling on to some pathetic hope that makes me feel better."
RedPillWomen,3d26xm,tintedlipbalm,11,Mon Jul 13 15:05:57 2015 UTC,"RP doesn't say you will be alone forever, but that you would have to compromise as a consequence. It means your man might not be as high value, might have children with an ex wife, and other kinds of baggage.  It's about having realistic expectations of what comes with that age and the consequences of your personal past. It's never ""nope, you're done, no man for you ever again after 30"". It means being receptive to men who you might not be receptive to when you're young and have a big list of standards."
RedPillWomen,3d26xm,mannishwood,2,Mon Jul 13 15:39:26 2015 UTC,"Older men have gained in SMV, though, and even having children and an ex-wife is a plus for men in some ways (ie. pre-selection). Aren't those things only baggage for women?  Thanks for the kind reply, though. I do appreciate that you're trying to put a positive spin on my situation :)"
RedPillWomen,3d26xm,tintedlipbalm,9,Mon Jul 13 15:53:20 2015 UTC,"I think you're envisioning the apex high value man for whom that happens, not your average male who balds and gets a double chin, a beer belly and a bitch ex wife, or one that never was too handsome in the first place.  IMO this mindset you have might not be that you're hopeless without options, but that you might be too proud and would rather end up alone than lower your standards.   Or maybe you're being hard on yourself. But realize that the theory is supposed to help you understand reality and adjust expectations, it's not some strict rule either. If you're fit and gracious, you already have some advantage to many women even younger than yourself. I don't know, your situation doesn't seem like a lost cause and would need a thread of its own because it's way different than the OP here."
RedPillWomen,3d26xm,mannishwood,3,Mon Jul 13 15:59:28 2015 UTC,"Bald men are very attractive! I'd definitely be ridiculous if I was discounting bald and/or slightly overweight men at my age.  Maybe I'm being irrational, but I've felt as though I would be almost tricking men into a relationship with me, when they would really be better off with a younger woman with more years of her looks and reproductive capacity ahead of her. I would feel horrible doing that to someone that I loved -- like they were wasting themselves on me, almost?  But yes, thanks for the replies. I've struggled a lot with this stuff and there's obviously not a lot of space on RPW for it (because it's relationships-focused)."
RedPillWomen,3d26xm,vintagegirlgame,5,Mon Jul 13 16:12:21 2015 UTC,"How old are you anyway?  There's a great guide on therulesrevisited.com with specific advice for women in their 20s, 30s or 40s+.  If having a relationship and family are important to you then don't give up so easily.   And yeah some millennial babe might have a better body but they are so shallow and self centered, most older men are really turned off by their attitude.    We used to tease my aunt for being an old maid, but at 39 she married a 40 year old rock star and had 3 children by 45.  Her husband had his fill of young groupies and wanted to settle down with someone his own age.  This may be the exception rather than the rule, but with RPW tools you stand a much better chance than some young ditsy bimbo.    It sounds like you're in a depression phase of TRP.  Don't focus on men right now, focus on improving yourself.  If you're older that just means you have to work harder and faster to reach your goals."
RedPillWomen,3d26xm,tintedlipbalm,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:12:12 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're truthful about your age, you're not tricking anyone. They would know what they're getting into.  There are more ways to bring value other than reproductive capacity (and there are men that don't want children, or already have them). I would insist that you continue to improve on things that are actually under your control (fitness, health, appearance to an extent, demeanor, attitude, homemaking ability) than to keep dwelling on a biological factor you can't change."

RedPillWomen,3d26xm,vintagegirlgame,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:16:21 2015 UTC,"While more for men, I really like the book The Rational Male.  It goes over a lot of the RP concepts and terminology.

RedPillWomen,3d26xm,jasonclews,2,Wed Jul 15 20:05:28 2015 UTC,Pinterest.com/vintagegirlgame   Thanks for being accepting and suggesting material.
RedPillWomen,3d26xm,collidoscope,3,Thu Jul 16 12:02:54 2015 UTC,"The reason men avoid women who are in their 30s isn't because they're repulsed by the idea of being with a woman over 30, it's because a lot of women in their 30s didn't learn anything in their 20s!    A lot of these women didn't learn how to develop solid long-term relationships with stable partners, had self esteem issues, didn't know how to pick emotionally healthy partners, etc. Either that or they're still trying to act like a college girl.    A lot of women don't take the time to self reflect. There's a difference between embracing RPW ways in order to find happiness and using RPW knowledge to punish yourself and tell yourself you aren't good enough. It sounds like you're doing the latter.    Get in shape, take care of yourself, and get a therapist to support you as you try to make changes in your life. When you take responsibility for your situation, it will be empowering. The key is to avoid casting blame and beating yourself up over your past while you do it."

If you have internalized RP, you should know about girl game. You know a cheat code to life and can find a guy-even one that is younger lol. I know the game favors youth, but there are guys fed up with younger women and only want older ones.  A 30s RPW has got to have an advantage over a 20s BPW in some aspects."

RedPillWomen,3d26xm,NittanyLioness84,2,Mon Jul 13 15:28:09 2015 UTC,Do you want to be alone?
RedPillWomen,3d26xm,mannishwood,4,Mon Jul 13 15:29:30 2015 UTC,"No, absolutely not. I want to get married and build a home and a future with someone. But I'm 33 years old and the reality is that, biologically, I'm not in a place where I will be able to meet someone and have children before 35. I wouldn't want a man I loved to risk having children with me in my late thirties.  I was married for ten years. I had my chance at this and I blew it. Now I'm focused on trying to be an excellent woman :) I'm okay with hard truths about life for women after their twenties. This sub is about reality, not feelings."

If you take care of yourself and exercise, you can pass for a younger age. Plus, you know how to be feminine to attract the masculine. I won't try to change your mind anymore, but it just seems to me you are being too hard on yourself. You're kicking yourself for your marriage you say you blew, I hope you don't kick yourself when you're 43 realizing you could've had another go at a relationship. Good luck :)"

RedPillWomen,3d26xm,TheLadyPainter,5,Mon Jul 13 23:14:18 2015 UTC,"OP, I agree with /u/katherinekelly.  She needs to focus on her own emotional well-being/health, not on finding a man. She's 31 and ""the clock is ticking,"" but honestly, given her past of abuse, that should be the least of her concerns.  If this change in her perspective is true, and she's not going to just give up and fall back in to her habits, she needs to go in to what they call monk mode over at TRP.  Work out, find a hobby, go to therapy, get better."
RedPillWomen,3d26xm,cxj,13,Mon Jul 13 06:28:20 2015 UTC,"Unless shes really smokin I highly doubt she will be able to honestly get a high value man to commit to her. Doing so would involve very effective dishonesty about her past. Over on ppd I'm considered fairly lenient about sexual history even by some bp standards, but there is no fucking way I would ever commit to a girl with the history you described. I would sooner die alone.   Imo her best bet would be some sort of reformed criminal who is now gainfully employed in trades or runs his own business or whatever, but even then, if such a guy can get a girl without a power slut history, he will choose her over your friend.   This may sound harsh, but keep in mind even 24 year old RPW struggle to get a high value mans commitment, thats why this sub exists, so a post wall powerslut has pretty shitty odds of success.   The cold hard truth is that many people really, truly are beyond repair and not everyone can be saved or reformed. It sucks watching people close to you piss their lives down the drain, but in the end they make their own choices, and some times there is nothing wr can do for them after a certain point."

Thats why I said what I did, even if a high value man is a reformed criminal with a massive p count or whatever, they will still take the best option for them, which is among other things not a power slut."
RedPillWomen,3d26xm,PhantomDream09,3,Tue Jul 14 15:08:29 2015 UTC,You need to read the sidebar and refrain from giving advice until you have a better understanding of RP concepts.
RedPillWomen,3d26xm,tintedlipbalm,7,Tue Jul 14 14:56:20 2015 UTC,Well she is a slut who already hit the wall. Even after therapy (as bad as this sounds) she'll probably need to find a beta who's wife left him mid-life.
RedPillWomen,3d26xm,dipitybit,8,Wed Jul 15 00:47:28 2015 UTC,"Well consider this: There are millions of mentally stable women who are ready for children and have less than half the sexual experience of this woman. Plenty of these women are age 24-28. Let's assume this woman wants what this sub calls a ""man with high sexual market value."" A man like has a lot of sexual options, makes enough money to support a family, has a good figure, and is kind whilst being dominant and a good leader. Why would a man like this choose to pursue this specific woman, a woman in therapy who's been ran-through by countless men, over a young, hot, relatively sexually inexperienced woman who doesn't need a lot of therapy to repair her damage?  I know a thing or two about this, I'm a 22 year old woman (who's had a bad sexual history and has been diagnosed with PTSD) engaged to a 26 year old man. I was able to win him over with my femininity, caring, good graces, sweetness, loyalty, and devotion. I was also peaking in looks when we met. Despite all of this my bad sexual history was a huge obstacle to developing intimacy, and not because he's ""just an asshole who cares about virginity"" but because having sex with men you don't know very well truly warps your view of sex and relationships."

RedPillWomen,3crcjm,orangekayla,13,Fri Jul 10 03:50:14 2015 UTC,"Jon works split shifts. 6-6. So this week has been all days, 6am until 6pm, which is great for me. I get up, have a cuddle, help him get ready, see him off, do some tutoring, some writing, fix the house and then he's home for the evening. But generally he works half days, half nights. Nights are 6pm until 6am, so he gets up around lunch time, I often still have housework and students to see whilst he gets up and dressed and we catch a meal together before he leaves, we can only text until 12 at the latest as I have students in the mornings and when he gets home I'm fast asleep. It's hard.  But we do work around it.  1: Make sure to do everything when he is out or asleep. You don't want to not see him for the few hours he's home.  2: Adjust your sleep cycle as best you can. Days I am awake 4am until 9pm, like him. Nights I am awake 8am until 12pm. It gives you a little extra.  3: Bake. Seriously, just put fresh bread and cakes in the oven whilst you do other things and send him to work with home-baked goods and wake him up with hot pastries. Baking is definitely another love language.  4: Whenever you can, pick up the phone. If he calls and you're awake, even if you're a little busy, if you can make five or ten minutes to chat during his breaks, it can make all the difference. Also, send him nice texts. Not just wife texts (""dishwasher is on"", ""what do you want for dinner?"", ""what was the doctor's number?""), but make a point of sending ones reminding him how important he is.  5: Be grateful. Night shifts are a sacrifice he is making for the both of you.  6: Make an elaborate dinner/breakfast once or twice a week so you can enjoy time together and have a proper talk.  7: Offer to help him out with everything. When we're on nights, Jon and I try and squeeze ourselves into as much of the other's time as possible, as we know we will be apart. When our days off align, we go somewhere nice in the country, do weights, have a relaxed evening, eat some junk food and watch anime. We will try and do all our chores together.  8: Relax and don't let him know when you feel a little down because of it. Not when he's at work. As long as it's just a temporary drop in mood, get busy and get your mind off it. You don't want to make him sad or too concerned. Save any emotional complaints until he's home and relaxed. Saying ""I really missed you last night"" is endearing. Sending 40 texts about how alone and scared you feel is upsetting.  And above all: take care of yourself, your home and him. If come the weekend he's smiling and happy with you smiling and happy on his arm, then you're doing great. All the best! e-hugs sent"
RedPillWomen,3crcjm,SuperSlavisWife,2,Fri Jul 10 08:27:33 2015 UTC,I think this is great advice.   I'm in a slightly different but similar situation in that my husband travels often in Asia for work (6-7 hours ahead) and I know how much he appreciates that I adjust my sleep schedule for him. I make sure to go to bed early so I can be awake to chat with him when he wakes up for work or if he wants to talk during his breaks.

Being a new wife and all, housework and household management is not my forte yet, but I'm making a more concentrated effort now that he comes home tired. Knowing he is doing this for us and our future gives me such a boost, I find just thinking about it motivates me to go clean something. Adjusting my schedule is hard because I work early, but I have been making sure to get up for at least a few minutes when he gets home. Thank you for reminding me to take care of myself, I think we all need that now and then!"
RedPillWomen,3crcjm,jenna_r,5,Tue Jul 14 05:56:24 2015 UTC,"Aside from the break my husband took due to an injury, we've worked opposite shifts and different days off for the majority of our 10 years living together. Him swing and me days due to the nature of our jobs. When we had days off together we spent more time at home and working out together. With opposite shifts we do a lot more ""date"" type activities (archery, bowling, restaurants, movies) to maximize our short time together."
RedPillWomen,3crcjm,memoryofpetals,2,Fri Jul 10 05:02:25 2015 UTC,He put me in charge of picking out an activity for the both of us to do on the weekend and running the plan by him. It gives us both something to look forward to when the week is long!
RedPillWomen,3crcjm,memoryofpetals,5,Tue Jul 14 05:57:26 2015 UTC,"Sometimes my husband works nights (he is this week) or has to get up at 3 a.m. A few things I do:   Remind him to turn the notifications / lights off on his phone. Run a fan to reduce noise Keep a window in another room open for air flow Program the coffee machine to start running 10 minutes before he wakes up Try to be easy going about not doing too much Saturday mornings. Often I just let him play video games and we eat breakfast at the coffee table. It's hard because I've been alone all week so I want to DO THINGS, but he's usually exhausted! I just try to plan it for Sundays. If the weather is nice I'll have us sit outside for breakfast at our little cafe style table. Sometimes I leave notes on the coffee machine or near his things. Like funny cartoons or something. Make sure his bathroom area is clean and has everything he needs so he doesn't have to find things while half asleep I turn on soft, warm lights around the house when he's coming and going, because walking around in the dark is depressing He gets to pick the DVD and I try to make a pot of tea with the nice teapot and cups. Fresh flowers in the living room, even if just from the grocery store. Just anything that makes nice smells (candles, food), which can be very uplifting after sitting in a soulless office."
RedPillWomen,3crcjm,PursuingGrace,3,Fri Jul 10 09:59:58 2015 UTC,"Oh! I also put f.lux (justgetflux.com) or the Twilight app on our phones, for better sleep and less eye strain. We're both looking at screens all day and it was like a blue sun in our bedroom at night if he turned on his phone."
RedPillWomen,3crcjm,memoryofpetals,2,Fri Jul 10 10:04:00 2015 UTC,"I've been leaving notes for him lately about this and that, he seems to like it more than random texts! I made an effort this week to get up before him on Saturday and start breakfast and clean a bit, which he absolutely adored. I hadn't thought about flowers or something extra for the table! It would definitely be a mood booster. And I absolutely adore f.lux! It has made all the difference."
RedPillWomen,3crcjm,TheThingsIThink,2,Tue Jul 14 06:00:30 2015 UTC,"The first three years of our marriage, my husband worked overnights. And while they were supposed to be 12 hour shifts, because he was a captain, he often ended up doing 14 or fifteen hour shifts.  What really made him happy was how flexible I was in regards to how unstable his clock out time tended to be. I learned to figure out exactly how long it took him to get home, so I could have breakfast ready and waiting when he walked in the door. It was a small gesture on my part, but he really enjoyed having that time with me in the mornings. I also made sure that coffee was ready, and a cup was on his night stand when his alarm went off.  I made sure that his home was a relaxing place that gave him a break from dealing with prisoners. The house was always clean and quiet when he was home. And I made sure that his favorite guilty pleasure show was recorded every day, so he could watch it as he was getting ready for work. He works a 'normal' 7-4 job now, and I have honestly found it harder for us to get used to that than what we had going when he had the demanding job."
RedPillWomen,3clfzj,wtf_hell,32,Wed Jul 8 20:45:08 2015 UTC,"What's done is done.  I don't mean that to excuse you from it, but now that you know, your energies should be on where to go from here.  It's difficult to realize where you've been going wrong your entire life.  Swallowing the red pill is humbling.  But what counts is where you go from here.  Don't be afraid to read the book.  It is light, positive, and explanatory.  The author talks about the mistakes she'd been making all along.    Remember, your goal is on self-improvement, not self-flagellation.  Things will start to turn around once you start implementing the ideas in the book (and remember NOT TO TELL HIM you're doing it.)    It's going to take him a long time to trust that you will be different.  This is going to take time and consistency from you before he will begin to trust you again.  If he asks what's different, you can say something vague about how you realized you hadn't been appreciating him, and how you want to start doing that and being as happy and fulfilled in every day as you can be.    You must work every day to change your ways.  I did it, and I'm 3-4 months in, and I am on myself every single day to keep myself in check.  I've had a few slip ups, but I rectify them as soon as I notice.    My experience was that shortly after changing my ways, things got so easy.  It's a relief not to be in control of every little thing.  If you work outside the home, it's a relief to know that you can come home, and aside from your chores and taking care of your man, you're done thinking for the day.  You will be less Type A, and you'll let things go.  You'll realize your husband survived for many years without you (i.e. not doing things your way) and he can go on to survive without you and with another woman who will appreciate him.  So, instead, you'll be the one appreciating him.    The longer you go with this, the more rewards you'll see.  Your man will step into leadership when you step out of it.  He'll gain confidence, and you'll see him as sexy and capable.  Your feminine qualities will emerge.  You'll be happy together again.    Again, don't expect miracles from the get go.  Turn the self-flagellation into acceptance, and turn your effort into making sure every single day that you are changing your ways.    Edited to add -   I thought about this some more, and your nervousness could also be a reaction to changing your ways.  My controlling and nagging were absolutely tied to my trying to emotionally distance myself from my SO.  It was familiar to me.  So when I started making changes, the unfamiliarity felt frightening.  Actively making different choices for myself left me mildly shaking and felt really vulnerable.  So your discomfort could also be about fear of being vulnerable, and fear of the unknown.  Your focus on being embarrassed of your path means that you're still holding on to what is familiar.    Make a choice to step into the unknown.  If you've chosen a good partner for yourself, there is absolutely nothing to be afraid of.  Take a deep breath and dive right in, because the water's lovely."
RedPillWomen,3clfzj,RPDame,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:26:40 2015 UTC,"I thought about this some more, and your nervousness could also be a reaction to changing your ways.   Thank you for your kind words. This statement especially stood out to me. I've always been very type A and I figured this should be the next step to slowing my brain down and allowing myself to just ""live""."
RedPillWomen,3clfzj,RPDame,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:26:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  It's a matter of accepting that you have been mistaken when you've assumed that you do things right and others do them wrong.  Try and remember that you learned all of the bad stuff once, and so you can unlearn it.  It's just going to take effort.    What helped me was to picture myself and my brain back in that naive state before it was programmed to be ""right"", because I was never right.  I decided that I'd take myself back to when I was young and able to be molded, and reteach myself how to live.    You can do it too.  Force yourself to be in a pliable learning mode, and relearn to live in a way that helps you achieve the best life possible without hurting yourself or others."
RedPillWomen,3clfzj,fromanoldfriend,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:26:39 2015 UTC,I have a noob question. What is the reason to not tell him that you are doing this?
RedPillWomen,3clfzj,RPDame,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:34:08 2015 UTC,"There's a chapter in the book that discusses it.  Doyle's argument is that when you are beginning to learn to surrender, the way that you describe it to your guy is most likely going to be interpreted as criticism.    Also, there is no benefit to telling him.  There is quite a bit of benefit in just doing it.    Think about it - all you are really doing is removing negative behaviors of yours.  It's not a couple thing, it's a self-improvement journey.  So keep quiet, do it, and watch the early signs of his happiness start to flow in."
RedPillWomen,3clfzj,tintedlipbalm,9,Thu Jul 16 12:40:56 2015 UTC,"I don't get why you'd be terrified. It's a very light book. It's mostly practical advice on how to stop these patterns, not chastising. She doesn't demonize nags, but pictures them as misguided with their attempts to help out. The author mainly recalls her own personal experience, because she went through the process herself."
RedPillWomen,3clfzj,silvertongue35,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:20:02 2015 UTC,"It's more as /u/RPDame said, I'm more terrified of changing my ways. I've been this way for a long time and it's just going to be bizarre to me to not try to correct anything my husband does."
RedPillWomen,3clfzj,lisamarie330,8,Sat Jul 11 22:27:21 2015 UTC,2 questions.  Just answer them internally.  1) Do you want him to lead?  2) Are you willing to let him lead?  All else follows if you answer yes to both of those.
RedPillWomen,3clfzj,jenna_r,2,Thu Jul 9 02:18:00 2015 UTC,Very good questions.
RedPillWomen,3clfzj,jenna_r,5,Sat Jul 11 22:27:32 2015 UTC,No reason to be terrified. It's a great book. Enjoy!

RedPillWomen,3ca47f,Quindayo,16,Mon Jul 6 08:03:50 2015 UTC,"When Jon wants to bring something up that's troubling him I...  1: Listen and take note of everything that could be important.  2: Agree whenever he mentions something that is correct, reserve my criticisms or counterarguments until he's done.  3: Offer any potential solutions first and foremost. If there are no solutions, I will remind him that it's in the past now and we will try and avoid it.  4: Let him talk about it as though it were the first time. Make sure he's comfortable and do things to take his mind off it so any ranting eases off.  If it's part of his nature that he dwells on past mistakes, it could be good to  -remind him that he doesn't often make these mistakes  -not bring it up if you warned him or knew better!  -get him talking about the ways he could have avoided it  -accept it's a part of his personality and relax a little, the world isn't going to end just because he's feeling down, stressing will make you frustrated with it"

RedPillWomen,3ca47f,ladieaupair,8,Mon Jul 6 17:56:32 2015 UTC,"I try to just listen and acknowledge his problems; he doesn't like to be offered solutions - he knows how to fix his own problems, he's a fixer by nature - so I just listen and try to offer what I can if he asks my opinion. It can be helpful to offer help when it's wanted, but sometimes all he needs is just a quiet ear to vent to."

RedPillWomen,3ca47f,pcadrian,3,Mon Jul 6 17:55:04 2015 UTC,"He's taking a break from work and you work at home, and his family isn't in his life. Now he's getting worked up about little things and not letting them go. Maybe he needs some bigger picture things in his life. DH often responds well to a change of scenery, getting out of his physical bubble. Can you get your partner out of the house when this happens? Even a picnic dinner would help my man when his perspective is getting a little too limited, and I wonder if it would help yours too."
RedPillWomen,3ca47f,natural_thigh_gap,2,Mon Jul 6 16:02:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, I really like it. Problem is we live in an awful town with little to no green areas nearby, and we don't own a car. But I will definitely begin taking him out more, especially here in the summer time. I just found a nice little spot today, actually, and I think it would be a great picnic spot."
RedPillWomen,3ca47f,antariusz,2,Mon Jul 6 17:54:02 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much the only thing you can do:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4EDhdAHrOg  Just stay on his side (metaphorically) rather than amplify things with your analysis (silence works great, maybe some encouragement), but MOST IMPORTANTLY don't let yourself take it personally, because his bad mood has nothing to do with you. You seem to already do a good job at this, so you're golden. People like him tend to beat themselves up about mistakes, which later drives them to invest energy into bettering themselves. I should know, do the same thing. The only difference is it takes me very little time to break free of that mood, but I certainly wasn't always like this."
RedPillWomen,3ca47f,_wingnut_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:33:28 2015 UTC,"I just let him vent, ask if he needs anything.  Spouse works a job with a lot of losers and I know its not for me to fix his problems unless I'm right besides him dealing with the same problems.  He is just going over where he went wrong, and this is an internal problem for him."
RedPillWomen,3ca47f,ludovician,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:53:29 2015 UTC,"Going over and reviewing past mistakes is a good way to make sure they get permanently etched into his brain. He is learning to become a better chess player. You're watching his brain make new pathways and etch the patterns of thought that led to that mistake to be stored in his long-term memory. He has a smile on his face, because, like most men, he enjoys improving at things. Intellectual pursuits aren't as easy to gauge directly, but his ranting to himself WILL eventually lead to improvements in his play, and eventually you'll see it reflected in something like his ELO raising. The same thing happens with professional video game players. It sounds like it's become less of a ""hobby"" and more of a passion/career.  He's doing it while awake, but everyone does it while they sleep. He is doing it with something that he finds enjoyable. Many other men rant about their careers / wealth... because that's what we do to learn to become better at our ""careers""."

RedPillWomen,3ca47f,_wingnut_,7,Mon Jul 6 10:13:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not the person who downvoted you, but... men need to solve things, not to have the woman solve it for them. He's probably talking through his mistakes so he can be better next time.  It's OK just to let him talk.  My SO does this all the time, and after a few days of this he reached out, took my hand and said, ""Thank you. I appreciate you listening."" Then he took me to dinner, spoiled me rotten, went back to work the next day and solved the problem.  The only thing I did was to remind him that he's awesome and good at his job and strong and confident. Let him solve it. Just remind him that he can."
