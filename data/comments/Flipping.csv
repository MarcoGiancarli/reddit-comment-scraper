Flipping,3e325t,mrxw1zard,10,Wed Jul 22 00:17:37 2015 UTC,"""Yard sales are also a LOT better here. there are less but the quality is way better. Most people out here live in apartments rather than houses, but the prices and quality is 5x better.""  It sounds like you came from a poorer area and moved to one with better overall income statistics. My experience in poorer areas is that they tend to both have lower quality merchandise and they charge more for it because they need the money from what they're selling. Most yard sales you go to in ""classier"" areas not only have better merchandise, but the people really don't care that much what they get for their items. They just want to get rid of it, and it would otherwise been donated if they didn't have the sale."
Flipping,3e325t,FlippingCurmudgeon,5,Tue Jul 21 16:32:17 2015 UTC,"exactly my thoughts.  Honestly my yard sale trips always revolved around searching craigslist for community/block sales for this reason alone. i find at community sales/block sales you get a few houses where people wouldn't normally have a yard sale but because they have a few extra things in their garage, and their neighbors are out they decide to join in.  their stuff generally goes dirt cheap because they aren't looking to make money as much as they are looking to clear out space."
Flipping,3e325t,CLINT-THE-GREAT,6,Tue Jul 21 16:39:22 2015 UTC,"i would tend to agree with /r/FlippingCurmudgeon , I live in an area that I am literally a 10-15 drive from every possible economic tier available. I will say that sometimes tho, they (poorer people) just need money and will take anything you give them and the more well off people will throw the whole ""this was $200 new"" in your face."
Flipping,3e325t,approx-,2,Tue Jul 21 16:53:09 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Rich people either price things to go away, or they're rich because they are frugal and work hard, so they try to get as much as possible out of every last piece."

Flipping,3e325t,danielleiellle,5,Tue Jul 21 23:21:18 2015 UTC,"I live in one of the highest income towns in my high income state (got a great deal on rent and my day job's not bad.) Last year one of my neighbors, formerly a VP at Ralph Lauren and Louis Vuitton, moved overseas to take a C-level job. They were selling Christmas presents that had never been unwrapped. Got Uno de 50 silver earrings for $5, a $400 pewter tea caddy for $20, 9 DS games for $2, Louis Vuitton Garment bag for $5. And we showed up after noon.   I've bought 4 Hermes scarves at different sales for $1-2 each in the past year.   Totally beats slumming it for dirty sun-worn wares at the flea market. On the downside, I have a real eye for expensive stuff now."
Flipping,3e325t,CLINT-THE-GREAT,3,Tue Jul 21 18:10:31 2015 UTC,"is there a reason you only mail out every 3 days? I've been selling for 5 years and I always ship out next day, if not that same day. Most of my buyers who return, do so for the fast shipping. Just curious what reasoning or advantage it would be to ship out every 3 days"
Flipping,3e325t,CLINT-THE-GREAT,5,Tue Jul 21 16:14:30 2015 UTC,"I know people stick to one selling category sometimes, but I'm literally all over the place So sometimes I won't have the box I need in Stock. I've sold everything from plastic baby spoons to vintage toys to cellphones to picasso prints. Everything seems to be a different shape/size so I'll have to go that night to Wal-mart at 11-or 12 when they are restocking the shelves and get the boxes I need.   Plus if I sold 20 a day It's hard to get them all wrapped and shipped if I have other things I need to do.  Generally Mondays = the day I would drive out to the Auction house and pick up anything I won.  Friday-Sunday = Garage sale days  I am one of the few sellers who still uses auctions, and I literally had auctions scheduled to end every day except Tuesday and Sunday. those were my dedicated wrapping days. I'd get all the wrapping done and get things mailed out Monday Morning, and Wednesday Morning.  I advertised my mailing days, and let people know I generally shipped things out those days, and if they needed something mailed faster/sooner that i would be willing to accommidate them but they'd have to send me a message. I feel like this was responsible for a lot of positive feedback. It gets a lot of buyers to email you their story on how they need the item for someones birthday, and when you respond accommidating their needs, or throwing in a few extra items they become repeat buyers or leave you amazing feedback  I sold some Power Puff Girls cake toppers, this woman emailed me asking me If i could send out the package the next day as she needed it for her daughters birthday. I threw in a bunch of power puff themed party cups/dishes I couldn't even sell for .10cents at a yard sale(i buy a lot of store returns/liquidations and get some super  dumb cheap items sometimes that become waste). She was extremely pleased left me great feedback.  I feel advertising your shipping days, and getting buyers to communicate with you generally leads to better feedback. When buyers don't communicate with you I generally find they forget to leave feedback, or they are more likely to complain about things.(I read some stories on how someone got negative feedback for the color of packaging peanuts they used to protect the item they sold)  Right now I'm restarting my buying/selling business out here and I'm shipping out every other day, but I'm sure when I get more listings I'll go back to 2-3 day shipping days just so I can have buyers message me and letting me know about their shipping needs."
Flipping,3e325t,teh_longinator,3,Tue Jul 21 16:31:31 2015 UTC,"I wasn't questioning you, just was curious. I too sell everything from Cigarette rolling machines, to antique silver spoons, baby monitors, Playstation stuff, to coins from the 1800's. (different accounts for each obviously), so I know your pain about different boxes. Not too mention FBA shipments. A place i have found locally to source boxes, our trash/garbage company. Out in front they have several huge dumpsters ONLY  for cardboard. I asked them one day if I cold look thru and take some they said absolutely! So that is where I get all my boxes. Very rarely do I buy them now. Just a tip to check into possibly"
Flipping,3e325t,Ineeditunesalot,2,Tue Jul 21 16:58:33 2015 UTC,"I use to do that with a furniture store until I went to walmart. Generally from 11-12, sometimes 1-2am. they are restocking shelves DAILY. and they have tons of boxes all sizes. from small video game size boxes to laundry machine sizes. I'll drive a cart around and fill them up with nothing but empty boxes. I only buy padded mailers or unpadded mailers 9x12 now."

Flipping,3e325t,FlippingCurmudgeon,5,Tue Jul 21 23:55:15 2015 UTC,Less trips to the post office less gas wasted.
Flipping,3e325t,CLINT-THE-GREAT,3,Tue Jul 21 16:16:37 2015 UTC,I couldn't tell you the last time I took a package to the Post Office. I schedule a pickup almost every day and they stop by and pick up 12-15 packages from my house. So I never spend a dime in gas going to post office. That's why I was curious why you shipped out every few days
Flipping,3e325t,illHangUpAndListen,5,Tue Jul 21 16:25:36 2015 UTC,"If your cars are getting stolen and your house broken into, you're not going to leave packages by your door for your carrier. And being home for a pickup is a time commitment."
Flipping,3e325t,CLINT-THE-GREAT,5,Tue Jul 21 16:28:37 2015 UTC,"that's probably a good point. I live in a super quiet neighborhood, most people here don't lock anything"

Flipping,3e325t,CalloftheWildFlipper,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:45:44 2015 UTC,"do you have to schedule the night before? If I make a sale at 9am, it seems painful to me that their item won't actually leave my city until 5 or 6pm the next day after pick up."
Flipping,3e325t,IThinkTheClockIsSlow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:45:56 2015 UTC,"you have until 2am CST to request a pickup. If I get a sale after that or in the morning before they pick up my mail, I just add it to the pile, never had any issues with that"

Flipping,3e325t,beamready,2,Wed Jul 22 00:16:14 2015 UTC,Your determination and persistence is inspiring - thanks for sharing your story.  How do you have room to store items if you've got a family of 6 in a one bedroom apartment?  Do you think the break-ins were connected to flipping? By that I mean: Do people from craigslist come to your house and could they have determined your house was a target for burglary? (I worry about that sometimes...so I try to meet craigslisters not at my house.) Or did people around you notice you taking packages to your car frequently and decide what you're shipping might be worth stealing?
Flipping,3e325t,mrluisescobar,3,Tue Jul 21 18:06:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly everyones house in my neighborhood was getting their house broken into so it's difficult to say. but I do think having people meet you at your house and seeing stuff really makes you a target. People talk about the items you have, and it just takes them mentioning it to the wrong person and you become a target  as far as how we have space. Right now its extremely tight lol. I'm just listing things as fast as I can and trying to get them out. our 1 bedroom is pretty much consumed with nothing but our clothes we still haven't sorted out. closets/kitchen counters/drawers are filled with stuff posted. and  the living room is filled with items waiting to be posted, and large items that are posted that wont fit in the drawers or closets  posting the majority of stuff on offer up and facebook groups.   https://offerupnow.com/p/4080373/  http://sandiego.craigslist.org/search/sss?userid=265055602  I only have a few big things on ebay. most of it is on facebook"

Flipping,3e17sr,wardetbestanee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:42:43 2015 UTC,Its more likely these are places for kid exchanges for parents.  Just so happens it also works out well for buy and sell meet ups.

Flipping,3e17sr,RiggRMortis,11,Tue Jul 21 04:55:10 2015 UTC,"Many police departments are allowing exchanges like this to happen in their lobbies or designated rooms nearby, so this might be a specially painted extension of that, or maybe somewhere in a city-operated place like City Hall."

Flipping,3e17sr,LightShadow,2,Tue Jul 21 16:20:53 2015 UTC,What do you mean by that? Someone selling drugs probably isn't going to meet up in a police lobby.
Flipping,3e17sr,Alex-Gopson,2,Tue Jul 21 17:53:05 2015 UTC,That's true.  Perhaps the poster was imagining a world where exchanges of things like drugs are done in a way to minimize risk of all parties involved.
Flipping,3e17sr,zap2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:01:57 2015 UTC,The only reason this might be a bad idea is if they start interfering in the sales and start regulating what can and cannot be sold and maybe create a law that says you're not allowed to sell anything outside of these designated spots. Oh the horror.

A company will offer local laser body scanning outlets to measure your exact fit for clothing for online ordering.

If he had indeed told you that he did not get it and no one at his home picked it and then mysteriously found it when you mentioned blacklisting that would be a scam for sure.

I don't know if the guy was trying to scam you or not, he could just be one of those buyers who isn't constantly on ebay or didn't respond when someone told him that they picked up the delivery. Since they have such good feedback, it would be odd if he was a serial scammer...eventually the account would get pinged. Though I did have a non-paying buyer who had a ton of ""positive"" feedback from sellers stating ""Seller beware, never paid for item!""  I think you handled it well by saying that you'd blacklist the phone with Verizon, but I would also add that they would need to file a police report for stolen mail in order to get a refund. Keeping things professional and not letting emotions or accusations go wild is definitely the way to go on ebay, as some buyers and sellers tend to love the drama. Glad it worked out!

I've mostly been doing BIN because when I've been researching it seems that a lot of clothing stuff that are run as auctions sell for quite a bit less then the BIN ones unless they are some kind of rare item.  I might try some auctions though. I've sold stuff , but I'm also thinking I'd like to get more consistent sales even if it's lower prices. At least with the clothing I'm selling..mostly shirts they are pretty easy to ship and it doesn't take very long.   What do your 99cent auctions usually go up to? It seems nowadays a lot of auctions don't get many bids and people just wait to bid until the end.  I should experiment a bit with this though."

At that point, I'll leave it up for a few days before I decide to bring it back for return.   Tip: Before you get rid of it for sure, remove the listing a day or two in advance.

Flipping,3dzbnk,jm1982,2,Mon Jul 20 23:50:13 2015 UTC,I just rent a space occasionally.  If I had every weekend free I would probably look into getting a regular space.  The cost varies depending on the market.  The ones I've sold at have ranged between $10-$17 for a parking space sized area usually.  I hold down two jobs so unfortunately just flip part time.

Typically when I'm spending $2, it's because I think I can reasonably expect $25-$50 on it. I'll hold onto something for a good year or so before I decide to offload it, maybe a little shorter if it takes up a lot of space.  I live in a larger city, so space is a bit of an issue, but not a deal-breaker. If I hang onto something that I paid $2  for six months ago that I ultimately make $40 on, I'm still wayyy in the black. Some things may take a little more time. (I also have started calculating cost per cubic foot of my storage space to realize when something isn't going to turn a profit, so I've utilized that for some of the lower cost inventory in the past.)"
Flipping,3dzbnk,lukerawks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:56:27 2015 UTC,"Depends how large of an item it is. Books, CDs, DVDs, and video games I will hold onto for about a year, longer if they are worth a suitable amount. They don't take up much space so I don't care how long they sit if I'm confident they will sell.  Larger items I am much more ruthless with. After a week I'm dropping prices, after a month it's listed for ""break even"" price, and after 2 months it's gone."

If I get under 5 bucks per item, I end up wearing it myself to do outside work, I also might use it as a rag or if it's something that really isn't too destroyed I will bring it to the flea market and ask a buck for it.

Flipping,3dzv19,RainbowSpectrum,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:42:29 2015 UTC,"flippertools.com    The site would be useful, but when it asks for an itel ID to tell you what it's sold for, everything comes up empty. I'm guessing the software searches for the exact same name of the item, which would be difficult when sellers put different keywords into their titles."
Flipping,3dzv19,MinusTheBun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:24:02 2015 UTC,"If you are talking about the ebay best offer history tool, the item id is a number you can find in the ebay listing url or in the listing itself: http://www.uship.com/ebay/ebay-item-number/   I'll put some instructions on that page to make it more obvious.  /u/RainbowSpectrum is talking about the FitShipper tool though"

Flipping,3dzv19,_imjosh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:38:51 2015 UTC,"Yes. Exactly. What I said still stands true, I typed in an ID # of several different items and it pulled up no prices. Like I said, the software probably searches the name and since a lot of sellers use different keywords, it's not going to be a terribly useful tool if the keywords have to match exactly."
Flipping,3dzv19,MinusTheBun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:52:42 2015 UTC,I wrote the software. It doesn't search for names.  Please give me an example of an ID # you tried that didn't work and I'll try to figure out what's going wrong.  Thanks!

I've been trying to find a way to ship my cords for cheap, but I can't figure a way to! I should tell you I've never shipped - I usually flip through classifieds, and I'm trying eBay out."

Flipping,3dzv19,southsideson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:35:46 2015 UTC,For 5 oz it costs $2.23.    Edit to add: I pay this on Etsy. You get a commercial discount and tracking is included.

Flipping,3dzv19,_imjosh,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:51:41 2015 UTC,Always offer free or shipping that costs less than the PO charges. Otherwise you risk getting low stars
Flipping,3dzv19,iamasnot,2,Tue Jul 21 15:17:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but shipping cost stars are basically meaningless as of the Spring 2014 Seller Update  ""Shipping cost and communication detailed seller ratings will no longer count toward your performance rating. This will protect you from low ratings for shipping cost even though the shipping charges are shown to the buyer right up front when they purchase an item.""  http://pages.ebay.com/sellerinformation/news/springupdate2014/sellerstandards.html"
Flipping,3dzv19,hallsgator,-2,Mon Jul 20 21:54:32 2015 UTC,I'm thinking a buyer will ding one of your stars if they see that you got rich off of overcharging shipping
Flipping,3dzv19,iamasnot,2,Mon Jul 20 22:07:59 2015 UTC,No one here is suggesting anyone is getting rich on shipping. We are discussing how to calculate correct shipping charges.  Charging actual shipping cost will never hurt you.
Flipping,3dzv19,hallsgator,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:29:21 2015 UTC,I like flat shipping.  I hate when someone is using a priority mailer for something that can go first class. Perhaps its just me.
Flipping,3dzv19,iamasnot,2,Mon Jul 20 22:31:24 2015 UTC,Nope not just you. I ship everything I possibly can via first class. Sometimes I get items that weigh like 8 oz. in priority envelopes and it drives me nuts.
Flipping,3dzv19,swynfor,0,Mon Jul 20 22:38:09 2015 UTC,"If something is $0.50 more to ship priority I'm shipping priority. Also, after you purchase a box and tape it can be cheaper to pay for priority using their free supplies."
Flipping,3dzv19,geekygirl23,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:32:32 2015 UTC,and priority comes w/ $50 (or $100 if your are a TRS) free insurance. so it can be actually cheaper to ship priority in some cases if you were going to have to purchase insurance.
Flipping,3dzv19,_imjosh,2,Tue Jul 21 03:28:34 2015 UTC,"Once again, no one is suggesting that. I don't know where you are getting that idea.  But once you get into heavier items, Calculated Shipping makes sense as postage rates are different depending on where items go. Not everything can be shipped with a flat rate."
Flipping,3dzv19,hallsgator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:19:23 2015 UTC,"Many buyers like the faster shipping with priority.  If the shipping cost is similar, priority is definitely better for the buyer and looks better as a seller.  If you are referring to an item that could be shipped cheaply but the extra cost of a priority mailer is factored into the price, I guess some people might not want to pay for it."
Flipping,3dzv19,me3peeoh,2,Tue Jul 21 03:29:57 2015 UTC,"Either increase the price, find a cheaper way to ship, or abandon the item at your nearest Goodwill.  Consider also if sourcing this item was actually not a good decision.  Sometimes shipping ruins some items because of the cost.  Any item worth less than $20, is not easily shipped because of weight or size, and has a source cost of over a few dollars isn't a good pickup."
Flipping,3dzv19,me3peeoh,0,Tue Jul 21 06:34:59 2015 UTC,How can I offer free shipping on items Im selling for $15 that cost $15 to ship?
Flipping,3dzv19,Lyle_the_Crocodile,3,Tue Jul 21 06:40:39 2015 UTC,"What I do is list that item for $30, with free shipping."
Flipping,3dzv19,garbagefinds,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:04:15 2015 UTC,This is what I do too. Saves me time answering people's questions about shippings cost. I'm in Canada and calculated shipping doesn't seem to work too well going to the US or overseas.
Flipping,3dzv19,geekygirl23,0,Tue Jul 21 00:37:02 2015 UTC,"This does sometimes bite you in the butt when someone from Alaska, Hawaii or PR order. Also those addresses that require USPS instead of Fedex can be troublesome."

I've never gotten any negative feedback because someone was mad they had to pay what it actually costs to ship an item."
Flipping,3dzv19,dijital101,0,Mon Jul 20 22:27:21 2015 UTC,An example would be a board game. Maybe I am missing the special unknown way to ship things super cheap. If you want to know I ship UPS and include signature confirmation.
Flipping,3dzv19,iamasnot,2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:40 2015 UTC,UPS with sig-con on a boardgame is overkill.  Priority mail should run you ~$10 (depends on origination/destination).
Flipping,3dzv19,_imjosh,0,Mon Jul 20 22:05:56 2015 UTC,board games suck.  Tape 2 priority boxes together and pray that you are not shipping from zone 1 to 3
Flipping,3dzv19,_imjosh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:09:07 2015 UTC,"unless you are shipping something very heavy, large and/or far, UPS tends to be the most expensive way to ship anything.  signature confirmation? are you selling $200 board games or something?"

Flipping,3dzv19,5000miles2boston,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:24:57 2015 UTC,I'm not sure. How many people have tried to scam you? Out of how many transactions?  Personally I've never had anyone overtly try to scam me. In a few cases it was questionable but this amounted to less than 1% of my sales. I don't know why some ppl seem to get scammed a lot and others don't. I have a suspicion it has some to do with what kind of items you sell and perhaps also with how you price your items. Just a theory though.

Anyway, managed to pick up the following things:   Sims 3, Pets Expansion, Ambitions Expansion, and World Adventures Expansion - $2 total; already have a bid for $24.99 on the lot 2 Jillian Michaels workout DVDs - $1 total; no bids but should go this week 150 pretty cool vintage Niagara Falls postcards - $.30. I'll list them later this week; will probably split them up between sent and unsent and list each lot for around $7-$10. Factory sealed The Sporting News Conlon Collection baseball cards - $1; should go for about $15 A bunch of sealed 90s Happy Meal Toys - $1 for the lot. Didn't look up these when I was at the store but know they're collectible so picked them up. Most should get me about $5/each and the others I will lot up.   The bins were kinda crappy this week; no electronics, books, or good housewares. I'm not complaining though. :) Spent $5 and change for probably $50+ profit!"

I didn't know what they were at first so I only grabbed a stack. Were probably close to 500 postcards there!

It was weird, because the lady who was running the sale didn't know the prices so she went in to ask her son. When she came out she said they were a doller a piece. The lady didn't know what an snes was.  My theory is that because she went in with the family fued game to ask how much the price was, and she probably just asked about that one game then gave that price to all of them."

They both had a few ball marks on the head and face, but the shafts and grips looked brand new.    The other two clubs weren't labelled as demos but they were in very similar condition.

Flipping,3dys0o,SaggyBagz,5,Mon Jul 20 17:05:38 2015 UTC,I imagine it depends how connected eBay and PayPal still are. If their is actual legitimate seperation then they can't really raise fees without risking eBay looking elsewhere for a new primary money processor.
Flipping,3dys0o,capincus,3,Mon Jul 20 17:12:22 2015 UTC,I believe part of the deal was PayPal will still be the primary way to exchange money on eBay for the next five years.

For example, eBay can work with other payments processors and PayPal and provide services to other marketplaces. But eBay must conduct 80% of transactions via PayPal – with higher or lower commissions if the number rises or falls – as a way to guarantee it a stable source of revenue.""  http://fortune.com/2015/04/09/ebay-paypal-split/"

I think a big thing PP wants to do is go after their own retail platform, which we've been seeing more and more of recently.   I think they're going to keep the ebay revenue stream as-is to risk an disruption in that, because if ebay dropped them as a primary they would lose about 90% of ebay transactions....there are other payment processing companies out there that would LOVE to get that business.

Flipping,3dys0o,lukerawks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:11:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and other e commerce sites like Etsy, Ruby Lane, AbeBooks etc... They make it really easy for small businesses to take credit cards. Even some large retailers, like dollar general and Home Depot take PayPal."
Flipping,3dys0o,bigblacksquirrel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:27:19 2015 UTC,"Competition is tight, and with the ebay split they're losing the upper-hand since now people can actually consider other payments.  It of course depends on the interface ebay comes up with for other forms of payment (I like the ease and speed that comes with their paypal integration) but I'd certainly consider something like a 5% discount to buyers who use bitcoin.  If enough sellers did this it would shake up the market a little bit.  IF Paypal did raise fees, there's too much competition to go up 2-3%.  Plus, if you're hit with the fee raise, so is every other seller and it ends up indirectly getting passed onto the consumer regardless."

Here's what I do: If something catches your eye or you don't know what it is, put it in your cart and once you have a few things, move to the corner and research.

Yard/Garage sales can vary so much that I wouldn't put any stock in not finding anything there every time. You have to play the numbers. Hit many, many, many garage sales. You will find something.

Instead of spending more on an item thinking I'll make more, I've found that it's more effective to look closer at $1-$5 items that will sell for more profit. This totally opened up our business.   Once we learned to do research and really look at everything, we now easily find low cost items that sell for $30+. (We sell on eBay. Most our items are older/vintage.)

Flipping,3dxq91,jm1982,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:05:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your help. I know that my photography isn't the best. I I should probably invest in some kind of a light box or lamps. I wonder if for something like shoes that are new it's maybe better just to use stock photos? I did BIN , but i'm thinking of maybe trying auction style as I saw someone that did pretty well with auction style."
Flipping,3dxq91,Plyngntrffc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:25:58 2015 UTC,Definitely don't do stock photography. You will get an Item not as described case real quick if you post a new shoe for a used listing.
Flipping,3dxq91,jm1982,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:33:24 2015 UTC,Yeah in this case the shoes are new with tags but without box..but I can see what you mean.
Flipping,3dxq91,ebayscavengers,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:46:40 2015 UTC,These were Ferragamos. Problem I see with buying new clearance items is the competition you're up against. There are Chinese factories pumping out the same item as we speak. This is why the retail store put the shoes on clearance.
Flipping,3dxq91,jm1982,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:50:23 2015 UTC,"Oh ok. Pretty amazing you found a pair for $3, was this kind of a 'one off' purchase or do you come across similar shoes that can be sold for a lot more? Good points on the clearance items. I did do some research and saw higher recent sales on eBAY at the time , which is why I purchased. But i'll be more careful next time."
Flipping,3dxq91,ScavengerLife,2,Mon Jul 20 20:47:29 2015 UTC,"When selling on eBay, I'd say 99% of our items are ""one off"". It's not like retail arbitrage where you buy 20, 100, or unlimited amount of a single item.  It's nice to think you can make one listing and make tons of money with little work. Sounds awesome. But if something is so easy, then other people are doing it as well, so competition is fierce. Profits are razor thin. Prices can go south quickly.  One-of-a-Kind, unique, or vintage items bring such large profit because there is much less competition. They are often special in some way to the buyer. Takes more time to photograph and list each item, but the payoff can be much greater.   Every seller must choose what works best for them."
Flipping,3dxq91,jm1982,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:57:03 2015 UTC,"True, good point. The returns in vintage type items seem like they can be pretty massive. There isn't really anything that is going to 'manipulate' the market overnight. With buy new items at retail, a new 'improved' version could come out or everyone could decide to drop the price drastically. I could see how one could actually lose quite a bit in that situation. From everything I hear about selling on Amazon FBA though it sounds like everyone is selling their products quickly at good prices.  I don't hear much about items sitting for a long time like you hear with eBAY sellers..I guess it's just a trade off.  It seems Amazon FBA might be better possibly for those that want to invest a lot off front and get more consistent monthly cash flow. On eBAY I've been seeing a lot of sellers with hundreds of listings and they are only selling a few items a day. Not even high value stuff either sometimes. That's a little discouraging for sure. It seems like if someone had 500 items at Amazon they'd probably sell quite a few more items...and there is also the time saved by not taking photos , listing, dealing with customers ,etc.  Of course its just too different ways of doing business and people seem to succeed at both...but it seems nowadays you hear more about the people making good money - like full time salary money or more are doing it on Amazon rather than eBAY ."
Flipping,3dxq91,ScavengerLife,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:04:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe. I would always ask sellers who share their numbers what their NET PROFIT is.   I've seen Amazon sellers talk about selling $20k in a month. But when you break it down, they may only be making $1 an item after all the fees and inventory costs. The money in their pocket may actually not be that much.   On eBay, we sell 3-10 items a day....but we're making $20+ an item net profit. It's a good full-time income for two people.   But like we seem to be agreeing on, it's all about what you're excited about doing. I like to scavenge and sell vintage items. Other people may get more excited scanning retail items at Walmart. It's all time. It's all work. No easy money."

Flipping,3dxq91,Porkpants81,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:01:23 2015 UTC,"I've been interested in flipping for a while and tried a few items with moderate success.  Some of my past flips:   Bought 10 Skylanders at $5/each and resold for $12-$15 each Bought a few Cars (the movie) vehicles at Family Dollar and flipped for about $5 profit each. Bought some art at Savers/Goodwill that is worth considerably more than I paid, but I haven't flipped yet.   I really NEED something to supplement my income, I just finished my Master's degree and I'm looking for better jobs than what I have now, so this would be a great way to add to my income.   I've read the noob guides and such, do you think I would be best just continuing to sell on eBay (Currently have a rating of 45 100% positive.)? I don't think I have enough ""stock"" or the capital to buy stock for FBA, but in the long run that seems like it would be so much better.   The products I have the most knowledge of are video games, and sports collectibles, so I can pick out stuff that flips well from those much easier and without as much  research."
Flipping,3dxq91,lukerawks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:20:01 2015 UTC,"Well, each have their specific benefits and drawbacks. I'm an ebay guy, so I am obviously going to say ebay. There are tons of folks doing RA through Amazon as well, and it seems like they do quite well at it.   If you're seeing success with ebay right now and have an eye for sports and video games, I would continue to ramp up your ebay store and wait until you're bringing in more profits before diving into RA. I don't know a ton about RA through Amazon, but it seems like margins are a little tighter according to numbers that people share on here."
Flipping,3dxq91,Porkpants81,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:27:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah from what I've read, FBA isn't worth doing unless you have a decent stock to ship.  It definitely doesn't seem worthwhile to just do random single items."
Flipping,3dxq91,capincus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:29:33 2015 UTC,Decent stock really just means 2 maybe 3 boxes at least so when they split up your shipments you don't end up sending single items to each distribution warehouse.
Flipping,3dxq91,Porkpants81,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:21:26 2015 UTC,So say i found new copies of a video game for $5 each and could sell for $15.  How many copies would I have to send it to make FBA worthwhile?
Flipping,3dxq91,capincus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:37:41 2015 UTC,If it's all the same thing you'll probably just be shipping all to one warehouse so it doesn't really matter. You'll save more on shipping the more you send in but it's pretty ridiculously cheap anyways.
Flipping,3dxq91,Porkpants81,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:41:51 2015 UTC,Yeah that makes sense. I've actually been shipping through my office's account and then making the payments for shipping with my card so I get to take advantage of the almost 70% discount through FedEx.

As for how long it took me to get to where I am now, I don't really know.  I've been doing this for years on the side, and full time for 1.5 years.  But those questions are a waste of time for me.  You could work harder than me and surpass where I am in half the time, or you could be lazy and take twice as long.  Work ethic is everything in this game.  If you are hitting up a couple thrift stores after work every day, browsing Craigslist for deals every evening, etc. then you can build up an inventory worth $1000+ in a matter of weeks.

Just enter the weight and dimensions and eBay will automatically calculate the correct postage for your customer to pay. If it is something very heavy that will fit in a Flat Rate box, you may just want to do that. Also, get Padded Flat Rate mailers from usps.com. They cost under $6 to ship and can fit heavy clothing items and smaller, heavy goods and ship very cheaply. The PFRE is the best deal in shipping.  Shipping seems intimidating, but it's actually quite simply once you understand that it's simply the weight and size of the item plus how far it is traveling.

The absolute way to do this is pre-pack the item and then weigh and measure the box.  Most people don't do this, but until you get better at it, you might think about it.  With the box measurements in hand, enter them into your listing and choose calculated shipping.  Then, no matter where your buyer lives, Ebay will charge them the correct amount for shipping and you won't lose any money.  cheers"

I am new to flipping athletic clothing so not sure if this is a thing. I saw the exact same skirt for sale on ebay and the description does not mention anything about being authentic.

That may thin the herd a bit, but there's still a risk. I see one of these every week and a half or so, but it's not as big of an issue because for every one of those I have 10 or so good ones.  Out of curiosity, what are you selling? Do you suspect foul play from any competition in your niche? Not trying to get all tinfoil hat on you here, but I have heard about this happening before in very niche markets when competition starts up."

If the site becomes hostile to buyers, they'll gladly take their dollars elsewhere. Not that I agree with removing this feature, but it was definitely abused by a lot of folks.  As to people saying it's on the rise, I wouldn't think so. I would say that they've always struggled with non-paying auction winners, and they always will. The alternative is to make the site a turnoff for new members to take part in, which would really blow for all of us."

Actually, /u/flippingtimmy sent me a message (sorry I forgot to reply to you mate!) talking about Aussie flippers from different states possibly helping each other out with shipping things, hopefully he sees my mention here and will come to weigh in.  I would love to source things from op shops (I have a Vinnies, Salvo's and a Good Sammy's near me) but I sort of feel as though I'm out of my depth when it comes to knowing what to look for, plus I live in a nice-ish neighbourhood (not posh but not a shithole :P) and everything seems to be priced to match that. I don't know, maybe just need to try it more often.  Do you buy your prepaid bags in bulk? That can bring the price down. I have a couple left over from when eBay was letting us order the special eBay ones for free. I remember using Click and Send to post those, is that something you've tried? I don't know how the rates compare."
Flipping,3dxa2d,Bels_Alexis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:53:24 2015 UTC,"Nice to meet you! I'm based in Brisbane, QLD. I have been meaning to get into flipping on Gumtree, I have sourced a few items from there but haven't had a decent look in a while.   I drive all around Brisbane looking at op shops, some are priced okay, others (for example the majority of the Lifeline chain, they tend to have high prices, especially for name-brand clothing) can be too expensive to source from. Watching videos on YouTube really helps me gain a knowledge of what to buy and for how much.   I don't buy my bags in bulk because when I was casually flipping, I wasn't selling enough to buy in bulk, but I am thinking of doing it this week as I have a good amount of items to post. I just hate how high the postage prices are here compared to the USA. $8.25 for a 500g Australia-wide satchel, bulk buying only brings the price down to $7 something per bag, but it must suck for buyers, especially if the postage costs more than their item! And the price just goes up if the item is heavier than 500g.   I like the prepaid satchels because I know how much it will be to send anywhere in Australia. I have looked into the click and send ones, they look great, but the price does vary depending on where it is being sent to, and from what I could tell, it usually was higher than the flat rate satchels.   It would be great to get together with other Aussie flippers to share our experiences and knowledge :)"

I live in Perth along with Bels_Alexis and because I'm into flipping mainly electronics/computer stuff, I'm a bit miffed that I can't get access to a lot of the stuff in the eastern states.  Also miffed that the thrift shops in Perth don't sell any old electronics. I'd love to get my hands on old game consoles and the like.  I find the best places for me to get stuff has been at auction. New stuff in boxes like cameras and speakers.   Have sold some things through Gumtree but I don't like a lot of the people who actually frequent Gumtree. Always asking you to cut your price by stupid amounts. Grrr.  I did have an idea whereby Aussies into flipping could get together and do favours for each other in different states.   Eg: I see an auction in Sydney I'd really like to bid on but it's a pickup only auction and obviously I can't get there. So far, Pack and send is the only viable service I have found that can do the job of shipping to WA. However, the quotes I've received for actual packing and sending have been huge. Like $200 for a watch from Darwin. Perhaps we could do quid pro quo favours or even pay someone from another state to pick up the item(s) and send them to us. Thoughts?"

In fact, since Amazon wouldn't know a customer was paying with a gift card until they were checking out, they'd have to THEN notify them that they couldn't use it. Seems like a good way to piss a lot of people off.  But in any case we are leaving merchant fulfilled completely, except for some old records we still have that may not move quickly enough to be worth FBA, so it doesn't really affect us as sellers either way."

It's nice because it opens up more options on high-volume low-priced items by removing that $1 per item sold. Things that would've made me $.90 profit on a $2 a piece purchase will now nearly double my investment because I keep that extra dollar.   Also, not to confuse anyone, my sales shown here aren't $2 a piece type items. The cheapest are $5-6 a piece but most are much higher. I was just explaining that purchasing 100 items for $200 that would have turned into $300 before a pro account will now turn into $400 because I have one. Definitely a worthwhile purchase."

Flipping,3duu5z,jm1982,3,Mon Jul 20 01:59:05 2015 UTC,"For the most part, margins will be smaller on FBA than on eBay, but will sell much faster. I'll come back to why I still like that better in most cases, but the beauty of FBA is that you can now sell things that don't make it worth your while to sell them one by one. For example, two days ago I went to Walmart and found an item for $2 that sells for much more on Amazon, and is ranked very highly, so I know they sell fast. After fees, it's just over $5 profit per item, whereas on eBay I may be able to make $7 profit. I bought all of the items in stock, a total of 48, so I expect to make about $250 through FBA. Now, if I had sold them on eBay, I could make $350, but I would have to package 48 items and make 48 trips to the post office to make that $350, whereas I only have to make one package and one trip to the UPS store to sell them on FBA. Not worthwhile for $7 each on eBay, but totally worthwhile for $250 on FBA.  Now even in circumstances where I'm selling one or two of a particular item at a higher margin, it comes down to wanting to make a quick nickel or a slow dime. A lot of flippers out there want a big inventory for a slow dime, but by getting a quick nickel, I can reinvest in sooner to turn that nickel into two nickels. Then turn those two into two more. So I could make four nickels in the time it takes you to make one dime. That's where our business model is now going."
Flipping,3duu5z,AZZTASTIC,2,Mon Jul 20 02:11:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah a lot of people don't see this but I agree completely. It's not just about margins, it's margins + turnover speed"
Flipping,3duu5z,covert_cakes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:37:33 2015 UTC,How are you making only one package to ship to Amazon?  Every time I ship stuff to Amazon they have me splitting my shipment up and sending to several different warehouses.
Flipping,3duu5z,covert_cakes,2,Mon Jul 20 14:52:26 2015 UTC,"If you are only sending one type of item to Amazon you case select ""case pack"" rather than individual items, and it will lump all the items together into one box."
Flipping,3duu5z,covert_cakes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:36:07 2015 UTC,"That's probably my problem - I'm normally sending 5 or 6 of an item, and Amazon always has me put them 2 in each box and ship them to different warehouses."
Flipping,3duu5z,covert_cakes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:50:54 2015 UTC,"There's one thing that holds me back from doing FBA, and it's probably a stupid one:  the baggies.  I'm pretty sure I can figure out the labels you need to attach to stuff, and I have a label printer.  But the bag-thing is intimidating -- how certain items have to be bagged in 1.5 mil thick bags with suffocation warnings.  I don't want to have to buy special bags, and how do I know which size I'm going to need?  So, did you like buy a mix pack of bags?"
Flipping,3duu5z,covert_cakes,3,Mon Jul 20 05:48:08 2015 UTC,"That kinda weirded me out at first as well, but after sending over 200 items into FBA I haven't had to use a single one. If you do happen to have an item that needs one of these baggies, you can buy them on, well, Amazon. I'd recommend getting 100 or more of the largest size you can find (generally $15-$20),  and just wrapping them around smaller items and taping them if they're too big. That way you don't have to order multiple sizes right off the bat, and can later figure out if it's worth your while to buy other sizes. But baggies only come into play if you're sending in loosely packed items or selling multiple items as a set."
Flipping,3duu5z,RaptureReed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:18:23 2015 UTC,Are you just putting the FBA labels directly on the packaging or box of the item? Or do you just have Amazon do that..I believe I read they charge 30 cents per label ? I watched a video on Amazon and it looked like they were bubble wrapping most of the items. It seems this could take a while if you are sending a bunch of stuff and also take up space..but maybe it depends on the item?
Flipping,3duu5z,errorunknown,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:04:46 2015 UTC,"It's $0.20 each IIRC.  I always label my own though so not positive.  I will usually put the label directly on the packaging or box covering up the barcode.  I do this for books, DVDs/video games, board games, NIB electronics, etc.  Basically 95% of items go like this.  Sometimes for bundles or multipacks you will need to either stretch wrap it OR use the FBA baggies.  Labeling the products does not take long at all."
Flipping,3duu5z,Matthews413,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:12:12 2015 UTC,"Do you have a label printer for this ? Or just print them out on labels on your regular printer?  I have quite a few NES games that I'm thinking of selling FBA , they don't have the boxes..since they don't have barcodes I'm guessing they would need to go in a bag and then need to put a label on that bag? Does Amazon have to open the bags and inspect the items to make sure there is the correct item in there? I could see this being an issue if the item was in a sealed polybag as the bag would be ripped if it was opened.  I really should get into FBA soon as it seems stuff sells quicker and for higher prices than eBAY and it would be nice not to have the stuff taking up room at my place , and also not to have to ship items individually."
Flipping,3duu5z,apacheco90,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:37:36 2015 UTC,"If the polybag is clear and the label doesn't make it impossible to see what's inside, they'll have no need to open the bag. I also assume you wouldn't need a bag for the games, and could probably just affix the label directly to the back of the cartridge, but you'd also be running the risk of not knowing what kind of dust is flying around in their warehouse.  And of the 200 items I've sent in, I've only needed labels for maybe 15. A label printer would be nice, but I honestly just print them out on regular paper and cut them out to affix to the item with clear packing tape. The way Amazon makes you print multiple labels on one sheet, if you were using sheets of labels in your regular printer, you'd waste an entire sheet for 3-4 labels, because Amazon always starts the labels in the top left corner. Once those labels are gone, you can't print new ones there.  Edit: I guess you could rotate the sheet 180 degrees and get a second use out of the sheet, but it'd still lead to a lot of waste."
Flipping,3duu5z,pixelbat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:49:46 2015 UTC,Ok thanks. What kind of items don't need labels? If it has a barcode does it not need a label then?   I was thinking the same thing in terms of wasting labels. I heard of people waiting to print until they have like 30 items and do it in 30 item batches..but that would be not practical for everyone.
Flipping,3duu5z,drock13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:51:37 2015 UTC,"For the most part, if it has a barcode it will not need a label. But once you get started in the process, amazon will tell you if certain items need special prep and/or labeling."

Flipping,3durp1,HandCarvedSoftware,2,Mon Jul 20 18:54:10 2015 UTC,"UK here also.  I mainly do online arbitrage of new stuff through FBA.  Anything that's in the £10-150 bracket not too large or heavy and not in a gated category on Amazon.  I make about a 20% ROI at present.  I'm fast forming the impression that the ""cartfulls of amazing things to flip"" we here a lot about on here are a United States phenomenon.  Spending half a day searching charity shops for maybe 2-3 items which need to be photographed and listed for maybe a £20 return doesn't seem to be a great way to make a living.  I think the charity shops are pretty savvy to the Internet now which is, after all, a good thing.  FBA / OA / New items means I pretty much don't have to leave home to operate and I can therefore spend the large majority of my time sourcing with the full range of online research tools at my disposal.  Deliveries come to the door and when I have enough stuff I'll box and label.  UPS then comes to my door to take it all to Amazon."
Flipping,3durp1,pieeatingbastard,2,Mon Jul 20 09:47:20 2015 UTC,"Buy collectables and second hand goods at auction or carboot sales/charity shops and sell online. The trick to charity shops is to not make it a trip in itself, just stick your head in as you pass. That way you havent wasted a trip, and the time that could be used better. Auctions I could fill the car I dont have, likewise at car boots. 20% ROI sounds painfully low, but if it works, more power to you. Your volume must be huge. How do you find FBA in the UK? Does everything go to one centre? What I can see as to actual user experience seems very US focused, I'd love to hear a UK perspective"
Flipping,3durp1,HandCarvedSoftware,2,Mon Jul 20 11:07:41 2015 UTC,"These are early days so only turning over about £1k per month at the moment with the intention of racking it up gradually.  The other issue with charity shops or other retail is that 70% of the time I can't get a signal on my phone so on-site research is not possible.  I've a strict rule about not buying unless I know what the outcome is likely to be through FBA.  Even when I can get a signal I'll often wait maybe 30 seconds to get a response from the Amazon app.  This plus my general dislike of ""furtive scanning behaviour"" has pushed me right away from retail sourcing towards online sourcing.  Car boots I haven't tried yet having been told that they are mostly frequented by traders these days.  Must check them out though.  I'd definitely need a higher ROI for this because of the time needed to list up second hand items.  Conterfeiting is another concern with this sector.  My FBA shipments go to one centre about 50% of the time otherwise to two or three.  Amazon UPS rates are good as is the UPS service.  Overall I sense that flipping is not as lucrative here in the UK.  For example my local tip doesn't allow trading and the charity shops have the good stuff creamed off for sale online themselves. The bigger retailers' ""clearance"" sales are usually just ""online rather than retail price"" sales. Nevertheless some opportunities are there if you are prepared to put in the research time."

We get several people every month offering to sell their websites, businesses, counterfeit razor blades... the whole shebang, even though rule 6 on the side bar is pretty clear. It only takes a few missteps to completely fuck over someone that's new to this game.

Flipping,3dzrnm,p8107,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:40:37 2015 UTC,"Buying an account that can handle volume that easily sounds too good to be true. I'm wading through feedback and such now to see if there are every any problems, talk about a quick fix if it works as advertised.   Your dollar amount limit is insanely high compared to the number of items you can list. Seems like you'd have a good chance at them increasing more than the usual amount given those stats."
Flipping,3dzrnm,p8107,3,Mon Jul 20 22:46:48 2015 UTC,This just smells like a scam.
Flipping,3dzrnm,p8107,-3,Mon Jul 20 22:52:32 2015 UTC,Everything smells like a scam to the skeptical. It is pretty impossible to scam things via Paypal these days and for $800 I'm not sure I see the point.

Flipping,3dvmvu,kmully,2,Tue Jul 21 04:55:43 2015 UTC,Doubt that works on relative small scale like flipping. Big companies can be tested to make sure they are living up to commitment to include in their orders. Definitely thought this was going to be about including ads to drive buyers to your own site and away from eBay but last I heard that was frowned upon.
Flipping,3dvij2,flamingwarbear,2,Sun Jul 19 21:43:24 2015 UTC,"You are not really protected at all as ebay prohibits the sale of intangible goods. In these cases you are not selling the game itself, you are selling the promise of a game at certain date.  Some sellers send postcards etc. and purchase tracking on it to get around the specific issue you are talking about, but it won't help against a buyer who is determined to get a refund."
Flipping,3dvij2,Nfinity14,2,Sun Jul 19 23:24:04 2015 UTC,"I'll look into your tip, though, eBay does allow presale listings if the item will be available 30 days from the sale date among other things. Presale listings policy"
Flipping,3dvij2,Nfinity14,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:36:00 2015 UTC,"Those guidelines are for retailers pre-selling their own product. You are reselling another retailers pre-sale.

I would suggest against it, though."

Flipping,3dvij2,Chance815,2,Sun Jul 19 23:18:22 2015 UTC,But the fact that Op has sold something that you aren't supposed to sell on eBay means that eBay won't do much to back up the seller.
Flipping,3dvij2,Frugal20,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:34:36 2015 UTC,"What i read on this sub not so long ago is that you ask them that you will need a police report that someone ""stole"" their package (because the tracking obviously shows that it was delivered) as well as a report with their local post office."
Flipping,3dwe4w,flashflint,6,Mon Jul 20 02:20:04 2015 UTC,"Do not just refund, it will be a defect on your account.    Contact the buyer and explain the listing they purchased was for junk and parts only. Ask them if they may have missed this and would like to cancel the transaction? If they say yes, then you can cancel it as Buyer Requested, refund them, and no defect.  They completely ignore your message, so you just ship it out to them and you did your part, you sent them what you sold them and it is So low value that should there be an issue later, I would not hesitate to refund it and chalk it up to cost of doing business with stupid buyers.   Do not hold a grudge for 3$, it is not worth it! Do not cancel without asking the buyer first, you will get a defect, again for 3$, not worth it! Just make sure to send them a nicely worded detailed message through ebay messages explaining that it will Not arrive most likely when they need it since its through GSP and it also will probably not work as it was only for parts. Sometimes people are just legitimately That stupid that they do not read the listing and expect to get a working functioning camera for $3 and have to be reminded, in the nicest way possible of course, that no that is not going to happen!"

If you must buy it, resell it on a Facebook trading group - hell, even reselling on Craigslist is a better idea than eBay. Scammers target brand new sellers with low feedback, especially those selling top-of-the-line electronics. The games should be fine, but a several hundred dollar console is too risky for a new seller imo. I wouldn't even be comfortable selling a PS4 on eBay, and I've been a seller for 7 months with 200 feedback.  Also, have you factored fees into your projected profit? eBay and PayPal take a 13% cut of your sales, after which you will need to deduct the cost of shipping and supplies."

Of course you experience MAY go perfectly fine, but you have no experience to fall back to know if it isn't going normally.  Simply seeing a screen shot of a working console, doesn't mean the console you are getting is the one shown in the picture.  You also need to deal with the selling of it, and as a person already said you will get targeted by scammers online.  You also will be dealing with bit of cash in person and that can make people nervous and miss things, like fake bills or a dangerous situation.  Buy and sell some other items and get more comforablte buying and selling in person and online before flipping major consoles"

Flipping,3dv0ba,NewbieMcRedditson,4,Sun Jul 19 22:01:18 2015 UTC,"As someone who started out selling her boyfriend's old games, I suggest selling a few things you have around the house that you don't use or have been meaning to get rid of. While they don't make me the biggest margins, video games are still my favorite thing to sell in terms of ease and quickness. I highly suggest joining a few Facebook groups in your town dedicated to buying and selling. I regularly pick up games that sell in less than a week for double the amount I spent on them.  It's a little taboo in this sub to ask what specifically to look for when getting into flipping. Do some research on what people will buy for $$$ that you can find for cheap at thrift stores, yard sales, etc."
Flipping,3dv0ba,Matthews413,3,Sun Jul 19 23:43:28 2015 UTC,"Moonamie made some good points.  No one can tell you exactly what to flip, but think about what you have laying around the house and work on the sales part.  Also look through criaglist and local facebook groups and thrift stores and just see whats out there.  I hate flipping clothes, but I know people do this as their entire biz.

Sell Price  $450 - $350(cost) - $55ish(fees) - $25(Shipping with insurance) = $20 profit if everything goes perfectly.  As others mention high ticket items(especially video game consoles) are targeted by scammers.  Besides, if you follow sites like slickdeals you can often find a ps4 with 2 games for under $350 brand new.   Also if any of the games are digital and not disks you can really transfer ownership of them, they are locked to the persons psn account."

Flipping,3duwrv,FUS_ROALD_DAHL,4,Sun Jul 19 18:39:37 2015 UTC,"1, You knew when you listed this item there was a risk as many buyers would not read and therefore would not know that the listing does not include the key.  That alone should have been enough reason to not list it.      2, Since it is so easy to confuse a physical media without a key with a game with a key, the sale of games without a working key is explicitly prohibited on amazon.  So you should have read amazon's rules before you listed.     If the license is non-transferable and/or the buyer will not be eligible for technical support or upgrades, then it is prohibited for sale on Amazon.   3, On top of that you've compounded the mistake by delaying the shipment.  In the off chance that this buyer only wanted the physical media, he is now going to receive it well after the date he probably expected, so he will be upset.  Obviously if the buyer expects a working game he will also be upset, so now you've guaranteed a bad experience for the buyer in either scenario.    I would refund/cancel the sale and send him a message apologizing, as you should have never listed it in the first place.  Take the small hit and learn a lesson for the future."

The older guys that have been going to auctions for longer than you've been alive are generally amazing to hang out with, and they love exchanging information about things. You won't see those people hanging out here, or at a local Goodwill, though.    It's one of the main reasons why I'm so successful with video games. I wear business casual clothes, I'll sit down and have a chat about baseball, the weather, or anything else with the people I'm buying from... while my competition runs around dressed like Malibu's Most Wanted and obnoxiously yelling about prices they see on their phone (seriously, put your fucking phone away when you're making a purchase). I don't even have to find items anymore, because I get repeat business from sellers that come to me now.

Flipping,3dttwd,Ineeditunesalot,2,Sun Jul 19 12:02:23 2015 UTC,So I've been wanting to give RA a shot now on FBA for a while. I sent in my first shipment to FBA of stuff I've had lying around for ages. Unfortunately Amazon lost it and reimbursed me so I still don't really have any experience with FBA  From what I've read people recommend to wait until you have 50+ items. If I'm only willing to invest about 150$ is 50 items really possible doing RA? How many items should I shoot for with 150$. Thanks!
Flipping,3dttwd,Nfinity14,2,Sun Jul 19 12:35:10 2015 UTC,"My first shipment was only about 30 items and only ended up costing .30 per pound in shipping. I only had 2 boxes with 2 different destinations with 1 single oversized item going the farthest, which jacked up the cost. My other, heaviest box went to a really close destination so YMMV.   I would definitely try and have more than 9 items in your next shipment but 50+ is really more of a guideline that highlights the fact that the more items you send in at once the cheaper the shipping cost per item,  If I were you, I would spend $130 of the money that you have earmarked on product and dedicate the rest towards your estimated shipping cost. You should also look into Inventory Placement as an option on your smaller orders."
Flipping,3dttwd,Ineeditunesalot,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:37:24 2015 UTC,What does inventory placement mean?
Flipping,3dttwd,Nfinity14,2,Sun Jul 19 13:46:03 2015 UTC,"Inventory Placement is a shipping alternative for FBA used when you don't want Amazon to split up your initial shipment. You send all of your items to a single fulfillment center where Amazon splits up the shipment for you. You pay a per unit fee when using this service, I'm not sure exactly how much, but I have been told that the fees+shipping on smaller FBA shipments can be significantly less than the default method."
Flipping,3dttwd,JayVeeBee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:18:39 2015 UTC,Inventory Placement fee is $0.30 per item.
Flipping,3dttwd,yankeesfan01x,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:18:40 2015 UTC,"Side question to that.  How long would you wait on a product before you actually sent it in to FBA?  Example.  I go out today and find 10 items that will make me a profit using FBA, that's all I find though.  What if I can't go out sourcing again for another week?  Would you let those items sit and wait until you get more or send them in the next day to not lose profit?"
Flipping,3dttwd,Nfinity14,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:00:03 2015 UTC,I would probably list all those items MF and wait until I had a decent FBA shipment. Maybe price it a little higher than the lowest MF price since you will eventually be sending it in.  I don't see a scenario where an item wouldn't be profitable if it sold MF and/or the market was so flimsy that the bottom would drop out on the price in a week. If this is the case then you should sourcing a different product in a position where you can only source once a week.

Flipping,3dttwd,RainbowSpectrum,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:33:19 2015 UTC,Have you watched the videos that Amazon has on the subject. Check out their help section. It explains it pretty well. Watch those then come back with your more specific questions
Flipping,3dttwd,NewbieMcRedditson,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:26:59 2015 UTC,"The very easy explanation is you buy stuff, label it, pack it, send it to Amazon warehouse where they then house it in their warehouse, pick, pack, ship and then provide all customer service to the customer.  You pay higher fees, but the customer don't mind paying a premium for Amazons 2 day shipping and customer service"
Flipping,3dttwd,Raptortidbit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:46:00 2015 UTC,"I have a couple questions today.    I sent in a full band guitar hero world tour set to amazon for FBA in collectible - like new condition because the box had some wear but everything else was sealed. Currently listed for 400. It's been a couple weeks and hasn't sold. Just need more patience or does something need to change (price, photos, condition lable, etc)? I just posted a baby blue royal quiet deluxe typewriter on etsy because it has lower fees than ebay and seems like the type of thing to sell there. Should I cross post to Ebay or give it a couple weeks on Etsy first to try to take advantage of the lower fees. Also currently listed for 400, the higher end on Ebay but well below similar things on Etsy by about 100 bucks.   Thanks!"
Flipping,3dttwd,TheBramlet,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:28:17 2015 UTC,"For the guitar hero world tour, I think your price is too high. You didn't say for what system yours was for, but I didn't see them for any system going for $400 new. So there's no chance someone will pay $400 for one that is like new.  I'm assuming yours is for the Xbox, as I see a set similar to your description asking for $430. I'd lower the price to $200, plus or minus your personal preference."
Flipping,3dttwd,Raptortidbit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:48:18 2015 UTC,Lowered to $250 so we'll see if that works. Some guy on here was saying that he sold the same thing I had for the ps3 for 400

I am going to sell some stuff I already own to gain experience selling on amazon and eBay.   I want to start with NIB items, selling on amazon. Shipping myself, not FBA. Once I sell an item, what is my process for shipping? I've read that amazon will let you print out the shipping label for $0.07. Great, so print that out and tape it on envelope/box (I plan to use appropriate size free usps shipping materials). So.. What happens then? How does amazon charge me the .07? Does printing the label through Amazon constitute purchasing shipping through Amazon, or do I pay for shipping directly to usps by going to the post office/scheduling a pickup at my residence online? Thank you!"

Flipping,3dttwd,covert_cakes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:20:25 2015 UTC,"OK! That makes more sense. So what decisions beyond that point (printing the label) are left up to me as the shipper? Will the buyer have specified, and therefore have had amazon incorporate into the label, what type of shipping they want (priority, priority 2 day)? Is it better or cheaper to schedule a pick up or physically go to the post office? I just can't seem to find these really basic answers anywhere. Thank you for patience!"
Flipping,3dttwd,smith6ar,2,Mon Jul 20 02:35:05 2015 UTC,"Before you actually click the button to buy and print you are asked to input item weight and dimensions, which Amazon does estimate for you. If you don't have one, your should get a postal scale.  Once you do that, you are given the choice of several shipping options with costs listed. If the buyer paid for expedited far shipping you need to choose a faster option, but usually the cheapest option is acceptable. If you are sending books or movies, media mail is often the best choice."

Flipping,3dvisl,PugSwagMaster,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:45:42 2015 UTC,"Well, after eBay fees AND paypal fees AND shipping you would be breaking even or losing money. Paypal is roughly 3%, eBay is roughly 5%, and if you offered free shipping that'd be about $5 per game to ship without insurance.  This would be something that you would want to try with Craigslist or maybe Amazon FBA? Craiglist has no fees, but might be sketchy that you're selling shrinkwrapped games from your home, and might not be worth the time commitment. FBA might be worth it if you have a ton of money to drop at once on enough games to ship in to them...but it's all about what you deem as a good enough profit margin."
Flipping,3dvisl,ndlundstrom,2,Sun Jul 19 22:06:08 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean with limited edition games, (lets say $250) you could buy it for $200, and sell it back on craigslist for $225. On eBay I think the shipping would kill on larger games, but the medium sized limited edition games you could probably ship for like $10, and game them pay half of the shipping."
Flipping,3dvisl,ndlundstrom,2,Sun Jul 19 22:11:02 2015 UTC,"If you think waiting for it to sell for a profit of $25 minus fees (if online) is worth having $200 invested into something, you should try it. I don't know how I would feel having that much % invested into something because I'd want a higher profit margin. At least 25% profit on things after fees/shipping if I have a lot listed and lots selling, but if I had less items I'd want between 40-50%. Just my thoughts, though."

I spent $120 last weekend at yardsales, and its going to make me nearly $1000 gross sales. Thats over 800% return.  And I only tied up $120.  You have to pick a route, but I surely like mine better."
Flipping,3dvisl,Serejai,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:57:55 2015 UTC,"Ebay + paypal fees are more like 13%(unless you are top rated or have a store which a person asking this question doesnt).  this leaves you with 7% to pay for shipping and make a profit if you sell at retail.  This of course assumes your in a no sales tax state.  So if its a $250 limited edition game, $250 - $200(cost) - $32.50(fees) - $12.50(estimated shipping) = $5 profit.  so if you can sell 50 of these you would make $250 unless of course you get ripped off or get a return. In other words, i wouldnt count on this as a business model."

Of course some full time jobs may not allow for this kind of flexibility (ie teacher, nurse, waitress/er). But my job does and it works for me.

But she's sent me an email with her business headings and things in it so I have all her info. I text her asking what time she'll be by to pick it up. She says she's waiting for the shops to open (it's an hour and a half before they'll open) and then she'll let me know, and would I accept $20 less than I asked. I say it's fine as long as she gives me some idea what time she'll be here, that I'm happy to work around her but I have things to do today as well.

Flipping,3ds6l8,Simplefly,2,Sun Jul 19 16:42:53 2015 UTC,"I sold a shitton of computer parts from one of my businesses along with personal things. Craigslist is the cesspool of bottom feeders - there's a few nice people that treat you right but majority I've found to be the bottom feeders that reply to postings. They want a DEAL!!! Even though you're already likely giving them a great deal! Deals on DEALS are what these bottom feeders live for, they all want to feel like they've accomplished their task of getting something for next to nothing. Even if it takes them months to find the right seller, they'll wait it out. I've had a bulk product of computer parts where I sold them at a price that next to no one could compete with. I didn't even want to do it, but I was tired of waiting so long to offload this product and it was only going to decline in price more and more as time went on. Even at rock bottom prices they'd still want more deals.  How I dealt with them you may ask?  -Simple, reply to them and state your price is firm. -Let them come to you.  Before they come, tell them you have to get the inventory from your storage facility first. This gives them the idea that you're storing inventory elsewhere, so if they try to rob you, worst case scenario they'll take the one item you have and wont tie you up and search your house for the rest of the inventory since they think it's all stored in some separate facility. (I actually didn't really have any storage facility, just always told them this to be safe.)  Many of them do follow instructions somewhat well when arriving, while some are just complete idiots and waste your time with multiple emails about how to find your place when you've given them an exact address and even provided them with a google maps link.  Some want you to go to them, I've had 50/50 chances of those situations working out nicely. Most end up wasting my time by me showing up and they start asking me a bunch of questions about my product when they should have asked the questions before hand. I've had people ask me to demo things like motherboards, video cards etc. While at a coffee shop with no tools around, no computer around, yet somehow want me to demo it? Nutjobs.   Again, craigslist is a cesspool of bottom feeders, be prepared to deal with a lot of deal searchers, and they'll be prepared to wait you out. I've had people email me constantly over a 4 month time period requesting that I lower my prices to accommodate them, as if they've got some sort of entitlement to making you give them a better deal than what the market is offering - they want to feel 'special'..  Good luck!  edit  I've also had people show up with the wrong amounts of cash, try to state 'exact cash only' in your listing. Also have some spare change just encase. I've had people come and try to short change me - I usually don't let them get away with it and send them home empty handed or force them to pay me a little more and state I don't have change. For example one guy wanted a motherboard, it was $70, he showed up with $60 and tried walking away once he threw me the money. I told him it's $70 and he turned around and said 'oh well I thought since I came all the way by bus and walked to your place that you'd give me a deal since it cost me money to come here.' I told him the listing and email conversation clearly stated $70 firm price no exceptions come with exact cash.  He then opened his wallet to give me another $20 and asked for change, I told him I had no change and now either he goes to the bank and gets $10 change or just pays $80. He ended up paying $80. You can say I was a dick since I did have the change but I wanted to teach him a lesson - he's a craigslist bottom feeder and I could tell he's pulled this routine many times most likely and gotten away with it.  Another person did this same routine to me but refused to pay the exact price even though I stated I had change, they ended up walking away without the item when I saw they had a $20 bill hanging out of their jacket pocket slightly and tried to lie about having enough money to pay for the price that we agreed upon in the listing/emails.  Don't be afraid to send people home empty handed, the bottom feeders need to learn a lesson about etiquette. Most people on craigslist are just average joe's looking to sell off some stuff for some spare cash or are in need of fast cash and are selling off their possessions - these people work hard for their money and shouldn't be treated like a big box store that can afford to give crazy 'deals'. Treat others kindly on craigslist and teach others lessons when need be."

There are plenty of sites that don't require sellers to refund buyers, why don't you go sell there?  Oh, wait, yeah, no buyers.  You can't have it both ways.  If you want a marketplace that attracts buyers, you need a marketplace that caters to them.  If your profits are hurt more than say 5% by returns/scams than you should look at how you run your business.  Let's say my shrink is 5%.  That's fine with me, because their bend-over-backward (or forward) policy for customers has easily doubled/tripled/quadrupled my sales.    I do this for MONEY.

Flipping,3ds11d,TheKid72,3,Sun Jul 19 00:45:26 2015 UTC,"Serious answer - for eBay, a year ago with a lot of notice and a LOT of anger by sellers. Plus it was retro active.   It is not just electronics, clothing sellers are getting hammered hard by people who ""borrow"" or don't pay attention to actual measurements and return an item as defective when, say a pair of jean don't fit this fat arse or Converse All Stars run a little long.   Worse yet, when you help a buyer and they are happy (no problem with the product - had an issue not due to a true problem) you are still dinged with a defect. A competitor can buy an item from you, open a return as ""defective"", never send the item back - and you are stuck with the defect.   I no longer sell electronics that are questionable on eBay. I will sell vintage audio in ""for parts / repair"" condition, but I skip the middle ground. Either mint / restored / perfect (which is what I do for a living) or as-is for parts / repair / restoration where there is an honest market.

Item Not Received case opened the next morning and eBay sided with me because the tracking showed the item still in transit, but it still gave me a defect.

I accepted the refund and told him I would process it as soon as I received the item back in the condition it was sent.

The price on first dibs is going to be in the high end, because the sellers are exclusively picked and interviewed in order to be on there.   Hope this helps! Often people can't find the designers on vintage clothing, as there just isn't much info out there."

Flipping,3dtgtl,stickybandit99,2,Sun Jul 19 08:04:59 2015 UTC,"Amazon ships billions of dollars worth of stuff, do you think they have the same deal you do with UPS? Buy their books from Goodwill at a $1 a piece? Also look up the term loss leader."
Flipping,3dtgtl,Ask_Threadit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:26:57 2015 UTC,"Given that it's currently going for $1 on the book remainder site we use for our bookstore, I'd say it's possible that Amazon can get it even cheaper if they order in a large enough quantity. However, with the 2 day shipping, it's quite possible they do in fact lose money on them, although those loses would still be quite minimal."
Flipping,3dtgtl,IndianaKid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:45:52 2015 UTC,"Economy of scale. It is a huge moving machine that plays by different economic rules. In some cases they do not profit from selling book x, but they might profit 2-5-10 times on book y"
Flipping,3dtgtl,verizontookmymoney,0,Sun Jul 19 14:06:19 2015 UTC,"You severely underestimate how little Amazon pays for shipping. Their 2-day shipping on a book is easily under a dollar, and they likely buy those books for 3-5 cents a piece. One of my wholesalers sells that book for 60 cents with a MOQ of 20.    Packing is also a non-issue, as their packers are required to package X amount of items per hour, and get bonuses for going above and beyond. The experienced packers can do 3-4 packages per minute, so that's only a few pennies per book in packing labor, plus another few pennies for a box and air pillow."
Flipping,3dtgtl,Serejai,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:55:32 2015 UTC,"Because in general, Amazon's own merchandise is a loss leader. They generally sell the item near cost, and lose money on shipping.  Most of their profits come from charging fees to 3rd party sellers to sell there."

Flipping,3dtgtl,flipofthewrists,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:22:12 2015 UTC,Because Amazon overall barely makes a profit
Flipping,3dtgtl,johnrgrace,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:37:26 2015 UTC,"Like many people have suggested, they likely are not making money on the deal OR they are buying the book at a very cheap rate and able to ship it very cheaply as well due to the service use purchasing power they have with the shipping carriers.   I'd tend to think that they're likely 'losing' on many items they sell. They're in the game of buying lots of products and then reselling them, they don't care if they're making a profit per say on everything. They just want to be the marketplace where people come to to shop. If you buy a book, you may also buy something else. It's a marketing strategy where you take a loss on one item but upsell various others or just hope that people see other items that interest them and do a large purchase order of various items.  corporations lower their taxes by having business costs such as shipping. It's how many companies can offer 'free' or discounted shipping in the first place, because at the end of the year their business profits don't look the best due to the service fee's they're paying on things like shipping and thus they get discounts on corporate income tax and get to spend more money to expand their business. Essentially what a country wants a company to do is expand and keep expanding.  Companies that can make profit and have no costs get taxed heavily. If they aren't really expanding, and aren't really spending but can offer a service or product with minimal effort/cost to them but rake in huge profits, they're going to get taxed heavy because they aren't a company that is beneficial to the society they're operating in. Society doesn't like users/abusers and a company that just makes insane profits gets taxed insanely to deter companies from being setup like that.  Countries want companies to spend money and make money but not make an insane amount of profit (or else they'll tax them insanely). You'll see many companies that have made a lot of profit during the year, spend a lot of money at the end of the year. They'll go to town with their spending, buying up a ton of stuff that they normally wouldn't really buy if they could avoid it, but they do this so that they show they're 'expanding' and bring down the income tax rates on the corporation. You'd rather buy stuff for your company and expand rather than pay high income tax right? This includes buying property, a company may not even need the property but to bring down their net gains they will state they've bought a property for expanding the 'office' - this office may just be a new home for the CEO, he can state he 'works from home' aka his new 'office'. He wont have to buy the house under his name, but rather buys it under the company's - thus its a write-off and an asset which helps bring down net gains. The CEO now gets a new home and doesn't have to pay the insane corporate tax rate that he would have had to pay if he didn't spend the 1 million dollars on his new home.  There's a lot more as to how these companies work and how they benefit from utilizing the system to its fullest. I'm not an expert on Amazons business model but maybe some points I brought up may be similar to what Amazon is doing."

I do know about checking the completed listing on the EBay site (app.) I have looked around quite a bit and not able to find much information.  Maybe you can lead me to a site or a you tube video that explains this.  Other question… 1.  Can the EBay app. scan bar codes? 2.  Does Amazon have a free app. for scanning?  I have a lot to learn Thanks for your help!
Flipping,3dq9zr,TheBramlet,2,Sat Jul 18 19:32:57 2015 UTC,Yes eBay app can scan barcodes. But in my experiences only recent and popular items actually have an items barcode. It's more effective to search by title.  Yes Amazon has a free scanning app. It's called the Amazon seller app. You can search by title or by barcodes. Searching by upc/barcode is very effective but not all inclusive.    The community here is very helpful and full of information. Check out some of these daily threads and the sidebar. Also don't be afraid to ask questions.
Flipping,3dq9zr,picdoc,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:44:53 2015 UTC,Which one do you feel is better for finding accurate prices?  How much better is the paid service for Amazon than the free? (I think I read it is $10.00 a month)    Thanks a million!
Flipping,3dq9zr,TheBramlet,2,Sun Jul 19 03:28:12 2015 UTC,"Both prices are accurate, but in their own way. Sometimes people are willingly to pay to more for an item on one site compared to the other. In my opinion, you see price history more accurately on eBay, as you can see prices items sold for, didn't sell for, and what prices are currently being asked. On Amazon, you can use third party tools to show asked prices and sale rank history, to paint a similar picture though.  I believe what your talking about here is a pro merchant account. It's a service Amazon offers which offers great benefits towards Amazon sellers. Some of the benefits include buy box eligibility and saving $1 per item sold, as well as lots of data about your sales snd items. This costs $40 a month. However this can very quickly and easily pay for itself if your selling 40 or more items each month."

Flipping,3dq9zr,cesariojpn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:21:25 2015 UTC,It all depends on how you want to do it and what you have to offer.  Do you sell off the controllers separately and have to keep around a useless console as a glorified paperweight? Or do you take a profit hit and bundle it together? Do your research and decide for yourself.   Do you have the box a/or manuals/paperwork? That could net you even more money if you keep all the shit together.

IIRC she was making significant profits like $50-100+ per video, but it had to be ""an original"" VHS with case, like from the original year the movie was released on VHS. She had told me then that you could tell by looking at the ""Disney"" logo on the case, and that certain ones (such as the one found on the Beauty and the Beast cases http://imgur.com/N53nlCX) were valuable and others were not.  Anyway like I said, don't want to spread misinformation. For all I know there have been mass reproductions of these videos since the time my mom was making money off them but I am certain she was making good money off some of the first-run oldschool Disney VHS films (Lady and the Tramp, Sword in the Stone, Robin Hood, etc).  edit: I believe they have to be from ""The Classics"" collection to be worth much. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Classics"

Flipping,3drg86,Cheznor,2,Sun Jul 19 05:57:53 2015 UTC,"Your best course of action at the moment is to get a proper shipping quote. Punch the dimensions into Canada Post and see what it gives you for shipping - a tracked method to Israel will be over $100 easy for something that large.   Message the buyer and say something like ""Hello, thanks for your interest in my item. Unfortunately, the shipping cost as specified in the listing was only meant to be for the United States. I'd be happy to ship the guitar to you, but would need to request an additional $XX to cover shipping. If you no longer wish to purchase the item I completely understand, and would be happy to cancel the transaction. Sorry for any inconvenience.""  If you're lucky, the buyer will be cooperative. Worst case scenario he doesn't want to cancel and insists you send it for the price he paid (which, technically he's entitled to since this was no fault of his). In this case you'll have to either just ship it and accept the loss, or cancel the transaction anyway; the latter option will give you a defect and potentially a negative feedback from the buyer if he's particularly upset.   If you haven't already, go and correct the rest of your active listings immediately."

As I was waking away, he offered it for five dollars, so needless to say, I accepted!  I know these are worth a ton (200-300?) (Okay, maybe closer to 100-150? Prices are weird across the board) in working condition, and I have the model with all the bonus options, plus the cover and manual. There's a few problems, and I don't know a ton about typewriters. The carriage return seems to be messed up. Sometimes the ball stops moving left or right. The spacebar doesn't always register. Otherwise, it seems to be working fine. The ribbon even still has ink on it.  Are these generally easy to service for a layman? If not, is it easy to find repair services for these, and is it worth it at all? I've seen some pretty high prices on sold listings, so I'd like to sell this as close to those prices as possible.

Flipping,3dopyb,TheKid72,2,Sat Jul 18 02:41:12 2015 UTC,"Novice typewriter flipper guy here - here are my thoughts:   I don't know how to price these correctly. I got a few on ebay of different types (selectric iii, selectric ii - non correcting, etc) so I'm not sure what the magic touch on these is. I do see them going for like 150.  Might have to decrease the price a bit to get them out the door. If you go the ebay route, I think shipping fedex seems to be the better idea. There are a few things that you can do to try to fix them up. The spacebar not registering sounds like maybe a sticky key. Check the rest of the keys and see how they are. There are a few videos online on how to get them work on them. Generally you use some rubbing alcohol in the lever parts that are in front of the keys and work them by repeating pressing them up and down. Once again, youtube could be helpful.  You may want to see if it starts working correcting after warming up for a bit. That's the issue I'm having with one of them at the moment.  My issue might be worn gears issue, but I have to do some digging. Anything beyond that I pretty much have my dad work on since he worked on typewriters for like 35 years.   I'm out for the next week but if you have some questions still I'll gladly answer any if I can when I get back.  Edit: You can always list it on ebay for parts - not working. Might get 30 bucks out of it. Shipping it without the shell would reduce the weight but that foam stuff that is on the side of the case can get pretty nasty and turn in to a tar-like substance - real pain in the ass to get cleaned up."

There are guys in my area who watch all the free lists for any sort of scrap.  And with some trash companies not being happy about scrap metal in household bins, these guys doing pick up are doing folks a favor.   Giant plastic barrels (30 or 55g drum sizes)  depending on what they had been uses for, they can be reused.   Food safe ones are cut in half and make for inexpensive animal water troughs.  Some use them for rainwater collecting.  Lots of uses.    For the guy who originally bought the barrel of product you're doing him a favor getting rid of it for him.     There's a little market in my area for broken lawn mower and whackers.   Most people would just throw them in the scrap bin.  But there are a few guys who get them running or strip parts.   Some guys have a dozen lawnmowers for sale at a time.   I've also seen the same thing for bicycles.  People in my area buy used fencing.  As long as the posts aren't rotted out, it's an affordable way to put some fencing up.    If you have the right contacts you can get this stuff for free.  Developers or contractors tear out fencing when putting in new construction.  Fence companies remove useable older fencing when they put in newer stuff.     Anything you can strip from an older house before demolition can be money.  Light fixtures, switch covers, door knobs, anything carved, transoms, exterior multi paned windows, shutters.   Craft people love buying the old multi pane windows for projects.  Any old stained glass.    You'd be amazed what crazy stuff people buy.    And the 60s 70s vintage stuff is also very hot"

They light up the room like the Mother Ship is landing.  No, you don't need anything else.   Previous to the lights I bought a light box from Cowboy Studios. I don't recommend this light box. It's best feature for me was that it folds up. Unfortunately, I didn't heed the feedback warnings that it is nearly impossible to fold back up. So, it's doesn't fold up and now it tilts sitting annoyingly slightly askew.   Now I just use those presentation boards for a backdrop. I got the presentation board at Big Lots. I think you might be able to get them at The Dollar Tree, too. They just open 3 ways so it stands up and makes a nice white back drop. I got black fabric for the table as a neutral setting."

Flipping,3dpjgn,Virtual_market,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:59:27 2015 UTC,"If you have a nice wall maybe not. My wall is bright yellow and a bit shiny so I like the white board. It's real cheap.   The table I use is white with lots of paint stains, so I like to cover that. The fabric I had laying around. One piece of fabric is an old velvet dress that I cut up. You could use a sheet, blanket or table cloth, too. I like dark colors, some people like white. For me it depends on the color of the item."

I have a table in my garage with a bed sheet tacked up against the wall that drapes over the table. It provides a nice background. If I need a color  background I just throw a sheet of brown butcher paper on it. Also, I have a roll of 4' wide white butcher paper that I use if the sheet is dirty or is in the wash.   All my pictures go through a photoshop script I built to change the white balance based on my lighting setup and that gives me nice clear pictures.   Take your time, experiment. Read some articles on lighting and product photography. There are some good youtube videos about that, too. You'll find a good setup that works."

I have pondered the whole buying from a distributor deal, but thats at least a $300 investment as these companies want a minimum of $100 purchase order. And then they aren't even that great of movies, so you will just eat the $300 in hopes AZ will approve you"
Flipping,3dp3ur,CLINT-THE-GREAT,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:56:09 2015 UTC,Ebay them.  I pick them up often for only .25 each.  I buy them at that price because:  A.). I can scan them at home and see their worth.  Last batch I bought for $5 had two Broadway musical DVDs that sold for $30 each.  The rest sold to decluttr for $9.50.  B.). You can always send them to decluttr.  The average is .50 for DVDs but there are some that they only pay .10 for so its still risky.
Flipping,3dp3ur,theenigma31680,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:06:09 2015 UTC,"It depends on the DVD.  If the value is high enough, you can generally still get some good money on Ebay.  The important thing is to avoid the restricted DVDs that sell in the $15 range, because 99% of the time if you check Ebay they are selling for nothing, and the restrictions is the only reason Amazon commands a price for them."

Flipping,3dp3ur,junkbutton,-5,Sat Jul 18 16:34:38 2015 UTC,Really funny you idiots will believe what a business will tell you. No company will ever close a huge revenue stream without some benefit.
Flipping,3dp3ur,The_Dig,2,Sat Jul 18 17:00:41 2015 UTC,"OK, let's look at things rationally.  You sell a bootleg DVD, the minimum fine is $25,000, repeat offenses equal jail time and larger fines.  Since amazon is a business that sells thousands of each of millions of titles, if no restriction was in place, they would probably owe over $500,000 a DAY in counterfeit sales.  I know this is huge with ebay at one time with people selling homemade recordings of TV shows.  Every business had to decide, risk vs reward.  The reward is low compared to the amount of risk that goes with each sale.  It's not blindly following what a business says, its actually common sense when you just sit down and think about it."
Flipping,3dp3ur,theenigma31680,0,Sat Jul 18 20:55:20 2015 UTC,Why would Amazon ever get get in trouble? They just pass on the fault to the original seller. Believe whatever you want but again no business kills a revenue stream. They could easily hire a team to vet more sellers. But they refuse to approve more sellers. Plain and simple.
Flipping,3dp3ur,The_Dig,2,Sun Jul 19 07:22:15 2015 UTC,This is so far from the truth it isn't funny.  Every company loses revenue streams when the discontinue a product.  That money will never come in again.  As well as sales from accessories and parts will die off over a short time.  Businesses have to make decisions daily on what makes them money.

Flipping,3dks8o,dijital101,2,Fri Jul 17 05:43:33 2015 UTC,What /u/hallsgator said.  They start stocking at ~10pm so at ~11 there is a good supply of carts throughout the store loaded with good boxes and in any size you need (this goes until ~7am when the night shift leaves).  (Avoid the cleaning aisle and hba as there are just way too many ORM-D boxes to sort through).  And don't make a mess.

Flipping,3dm741,Crazykirsch,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:36:44 2015 UTC,So I was going to wait for the Help Me Sell This thread but didn't see a new one for the week. Is there a market for vintage books? I recently got an entire box for 5 bucks and most of the books are dated between 1870 and 1910. Some I were able to find on Ebay but many I can't find any info on.  Here's an album with a few for reference http://imgur.com/a/7gaXB
Flipping,3dm741,her_nibs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:03:06 2015 UTC,"I think, with a lot like that -- poor condition, cheap bindings, mostly unknown titles, volumes from series, etc, the most I would bother with would be selling them by the foot for use as ""home decor."" (People do actually buy old books for that purpose.)  (But if you have all of that home ec encyclopedia, PM me what you want for it; Victorian domestic science is a hobby interest of mine...)"
Flipping,3dm741,CalloftheWildFlipper,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:26:41 2015 UTC,"TL;DR Vintage books sell, but it may take while. I would say that there is a market for vintage books, especially for well known authors. However, you would probably have to be willing to wait for them to sell, especially the more obscure titles. I'm talking months, a year plus. If you're ok with the long tail sale, set a price that makes it worth your while to wait. Because if someone finally finds your book and wants to buy it, most likely they'll be willing to spend money and pay a premium for a book that is hard to find/the only available copy for sale/rare. Depends on your business model for selling - i.e. do you deal with long tail sales or go for the quick flip? Do you have room to store the books?  All the items I sell are long tail, but I'm just a hobby flipper so this may not be worth it to you.  Obviously, being more than 100 years old helps the chances of the books being rare, too. First editions tend to increase a book's going rate.   ALSO - a note about books that don't have bar codes: You know all those folks with fancy phone scanners? Well, they're not going to find a barcode to scan on a book from 1870. Looking up books by hand searching ebay, etc. takes time, which some folks don't want to waste when they're sourcing. So sometimes with vintage books, you'll have less competition for the sale (in theory) because some folks skip over non-scannable books. Unless I recognize the author as being well-known, I pass on the vintage / antique book.  But even after all that above info, I think that for the most part, there are better flips to spend your effort on that 1) flip more quickly, 2) are more of a guaranteed sale, and 3) return just as high margins as you might make on these books. Although $5 for a box of vintage / antique books is a pretty good price. Even if one books sells for $50, then it's a win!"
