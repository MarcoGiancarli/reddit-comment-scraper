This is not at all dissimilar to Jodi Dean, who makes much the same argument about ""cognitive capitalism."" Her direct conclusion from this is that a class party of the proletariat is no longer necessary, since the proletariat is no longer a source of value as in the ""orthodox marxist"" analysis. Mason draws exactly the same conclusion about the necessity for the class party of the proletariat, preferring the well-tested and proven dead-end of cooperatives trying to outcompete capitalism into ""market socialism."" Here he is actually worse than Dean, since Dean at least acknowledges the need for a communist political organization, even if her analysis of the situation is mired in a petit-bourgeois academic outlook. Mason reiterates old productive-forces hard determinist garbage about how the party is an obsolete approach -- not because of politics, but because of capitalist technical development!  Mason's article was just such a blatant and lazy attempt to promote revisionism.

communism,3dyos6,marxism-feminism,3,Mon Jul 20 16:43:23 2015 UTC,"Excellent work.  Years ago I spent a great deal of time reading works like Duncan Folely's Understanding Capital: Marx's Economic Theory, Ernest Mandel's two volume Marxist Economic Theory and the work of the some of the neo-Ricardians like Ian Steedman's Marx after Sraffa. Needless to say, this literature is pretty dry, and my interest eventually wanned and I moved on to other subjects.  Authors like Zak Cope and the Third-Worldist analysis have renewed my interests in these topics. I feel the Third-Worldist analysis to be inherently correct, but I feel it could benefit from some very rigorous application of Marxist economic theory. Zak Cope is right when he says this is going to be the new dividing line between revolutionaries and opportunist social-democrats calling themselves Marxists, and the real revolutionaries need to step up their game on proving rigorously their analysis.  What real revolutionaries are going to come up against is the traditional nationalist 'Marxist' accounting that obscures value-transfers between oppressor and oppressed nations. Oppressor nation 'Marxists' will basically see anyone who makes a wage as being exploited. The New York unionized bus driver that makes $42,000 is just as exploited (if not more!) than the Chinese bus driver that makes $122 a month ($1,464 a year), because workers in America are just so ""productive""!  Also, in the mind of an oppressor nation 'Marxist,' buying the commodities produced by super-exploited labor doesn't contribute to exploitation at all. So if I have 1,000 slaves making cars for basically only the cost of the materials, the oppressor nation 'worker' doesn't benefit from their super-exploitation when she buys my slave-made car, even though she is literally saving thousands and thousands of dollars she would have had to pay extra if she bought a non-slave produced car.  Maybe to the oppressor nation 'Marxist' thinks slave-made commodities are just part of the socially-necessary amount of labor going into commodities!  Least anyone think the problem is with Marx himself, and not how his system has been utilized by opportunist social-democrats doing nationalist accounting, I encourage people to read Marx's chapter National Differences in Wages, and to see not only was Marx familiar with this phenomenon even before imperialism went into overdrive, but that he points the way forward.   In an “Essay on the Rate of Wages,” [6] one of his first economic writings, H. Carey tries to prove that the wages of the different nations are directly proportional to the degree of productiveness of the national working-days, in order to draw from this international relation the conclusion that wages everywhere rise and fall in proportion to the productiveness of labour. The whole of our analysis of the production of surplus-value shows the absurdity of this conclusion   The modern day oppressor nation 'Marxists' are in a sense, trying to revive the ghost of H. Carey. They want to prove ""that things actually are as they ought to be"" in relation to the national differences is wages, that the wages of oppressor nation 'worker' are a natural expression of her productiveness. Marx would undoubtedly have called this nonsense."
communism,3dyos6,Rangrul,2,Tue Jul 21 13:24:10 2015 UTC,This is like early Christmas.
communism,3dyos6,ksan,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:45:39 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting article, and the perspective is somewhat useful for understanding the basis of the labour aristocracy in the global north. As usual with Cope, I think he overstates the importance of these observations (one notes, for instance, that there isn't an empirical demonstration that this this sort of value transfer is the general case, but rather the article advances a perspective and then gives the example of the iPad).  However, the same political-economic errors that plague third-worldism are also present here. For instance, he contends that ""To claim that this shifts the concept of exploitation from the sphere of production to that of circulation, however, is disingenuous.""  And yet follows with: ""It is human labor that creates value and surplus labor that creates surplus value. However, (surplus) value is not a physical property that labor adds to goods like some kind of molecule incorporated and stored in the product. Rather, value and the transformation of value into market price is the result of social relations between labor and capital and between different capitals. It is the transformation from value to market price that ensures that the accumulation process continues on an expanded scale. This expanded circuit of capital involves the transformation of value and surplus value into profit, and the transfer of value from the South to North according to the low prices paid for goods produced in the former by the latter. ""  The claim that ""It is the transformation of value into market price that ensures the accumulation process continues on an expanded scale"" is precisely to claim that exploitation happens in the sphere of circulation; it's the creation of surplus value in the productive process that allows for expanded reproduction, not the realization of value (which happens even in cases of simple reproduction).  Furthermore, the problem of assuming the equivalence of values and prices is also present here. While the article is ostensibly about the transformation problem, it actually doesn't deal with it in a substantive way, instead just repeating Marx's conception of the steps in that translation (value->cost price/price of production->market price->price). The actual mechanisms that condition these transformations are not only complicated, but are the actual meat of the matter at hand. We're treated to an assumption that because there's a divergence between prices/market prices and prices of production, that indicates that there's a value transfer from the global south to the global north through this mechanism. However, couldn't that also indicate that, because of the ability for firms to set monopoly prices, that such a divergence means that value is being extracted from the global north and accumulated in these same firms? And even then, this is an analysis of price, not of value.  The section on the class/locality basis of class (income level, woops liberal political economy creeping in) was also weak; 1870 and 2000 are the only times examined. What about the transition between the years 1970 and 2000 for instance?  So overall an interesting perspective, weakly argued, and suffers from the same problems that Cope's earlier works and third-worldism in general face."

The production and the realization of surplus value are required for expanded reproduction. Recognizing this does not imply anything about where exploitation happens.   The actual mechanisms that condition these transformations are not only complicated, but are the actual meat of the matter at hand.   The actual mechanisms are summarized in the second paragraph and discussed at much greater length in Cope's book.   We're treated to an assumption that because there's a divergence between prices/market prices and prices of production, that indicates that there's a value transfer from the global south to the global north through this mechanism.   There's no assumption. The whole article is an argument demonstrating the existence of such value transfers."
communism,3dyos6,MasCapital,2,Tue Jul 21 04:34:02 2015 UTC,"Seems to me that it is at least somewhat disingenuous to claim this makes it all about circulation though, given that as the authors state and as can be easily verified pretty much all of the actual production takes place in the global South. If we combine that with the knowledge that the wealth differentials are huge the only remaining option to explain these differentials is a huge difference in productivity, which doesn't seem to exist.   One might make the argument that the class struggle in Europe and the U.S. was simply much more succesful, but given what we know of history this is at best a very dubious assertion and in any case it doesn't give us a material reason why this class struggle supposedly was more succesful. Whichever way you turn, one always comes up against the elephant in the room: the global imperialist system which is controlled by the Western states."

We're talking about market price. Market price is relevent to the continued process of accumulation because, as the article explains:   On top of the cost price, the market price must cover at least the average rate of profit. This is because commodities need to be produced and reproduced continually, and if capitalists do not recover the cost of production plus a profit when they sell, (re)production stops. Therefore, in Marxist economics market price reflects the cost of (re)production."

The fact that it's a cultural tradition does not change that fact (it only explains and justifies it to those engaged in that activity), the fact that you'd do it out of necessity does not change that fact (it might justify it).   to say that you would impose veganism in a country where culinary traditions are the backbone of almost all the countries cultures against the populations will and to say that meat   Yeah, the well known vegan plan to force everyone in the planet to become one. Strawmans are amusing, but I'm afraid you are just projecting your own insecurities here   meat eaters are sociopaths and can be compared to cannibals is completely unrealistic and detached from reality and honestly a lot of what OP said is disrespectful, culturally imperialist and offensive to Peruvian culture and traditions and to the culture and traditions of many societies   Vegans who say that arguably think the same about everyone eating meat, be it in Perú or in Manhattan. So I'm not sure how that aspect of it is imperialist. I'd agree that there's an imperialist aspect when you don't consider the different situations different people have when eating meat, but I have already said that's the backbone of any Marxist approach to veganism.  In any case I assume you yourself, right now, are not an indigenous Peruvian peasant killing animals twice a year to survive. So bringing that up when someone is talking to you about veganism is, arguably, instrumentalizing the situation of those peasants in your own benefit.

I think the description and analysis of capitalist agriculture and how it functions to deal with both pauperisation and the falling rate of profit, and the feedback loops around soil depletion and increasing chemical inputs, was fascinating and novel, and now I'm a  bit surprised that I haven't seen more Marxists today talk about the critical role of food, and how struggle is and/or should play a role in the food sector.    One gripe I have is that I wish there was more quantitative data in this book, and I think the presence of data and numbers would greatly bolster our ability to understand or verify arguments around food production and soil depletion, the necessary oil inputs for chemical production, how oil production has been behaving in the 21st century, and the qualitative shift in capitalist entities to go from being public joint-stock companies to being increasingly controlled by private groups.  I'm particularly interested in seeing figures around the last point, as well as what mainstream/bourgeoisie economists might have to say about such a phenomena.    Also, I think the issue of peak oil deserves more nuance.  I've been following energy issues for a long time now, and I feel like we're not going to see a peak oil disaster scenario like the one Biel is alluding to.  It generally seems that there is huge, huge, huge amounts of oil reserves when oil is >$80, and so oil scarcity would not necessarily play a huge role in exacerbating disorder.

So I don't see why you think MIM Thought would overlook differing conditions in different countries. MIM always said Russia was a majority proletarian and imperialist country. So it is not a law of MIM Thought that all imperialist countries are always majority exploiter.

So I don't see why you think MIM Thought would overlook differing conditions in different countries.   Well, I didn't say MIM ""would overlook differing conditions in different countries."" From what I can gather, MIM never really claimed to be Third-Worldist in the first place. Third-Worldism is something that has a lot in common with MIM Thought, but is not exactly identical with it. It seems to me you yourself have said as much in your posts.  What I did say against MIM, is that MIM had the line of supporting the Euro-Union against national governments in Europe. This is in contradiction to Lenin's position on The United States of Europe. Also, whether it is true or not (I am not decided on this issue), MIM also claimed the Irish National Question could be simply viewed as a whole parasitic nation trying to 'renegotiate their contract' with imperialism. MIM seemed to apply a completely different standard on the National Question when it came to European nations versus other nations.  Both of those questions together taken in the current context of Greece would seem to put MIM in an odd spot, ideologically speaking.   MIM always said Russia was a majority proletarian and imperialist country. So it is not a law of MIM Thought that all imperialist countries are always majority exploiter.   MIM also never tried to do calculations of surplus-value extraction when it comes to claiming Russia is an imperialist country. In any case, the basis of the Unequal Exchange theory, as put forward by Arghiri Emmanuel, would actually seem to make it a ""law of thought"" that the issue of majority exploiter is indeed linked with imperialism. In other words, a country that is not majority exploiter can not be an imperialist country extracting superprofit via Unequal Exchange. The mechanism that allows Zak Cope to calculuate surplus-value extraction going into the trillions of dollars a year does appear to be predicated on just such an assumption. If Russia does not benefit from Unequal Exchange, then to speak of Russian imperialism is meaningless, and trying to calculate their surplus-value extraction becomes impossible."
communism,3dn1si,mimprisons,2,Sun Jul 19 15:32:01 2015 UTC,"Okay, it seems I blended two separate points you made there. I originally read it as if you were talking about MIM and Third Worldism as the same thing.   It seems the MIM analysis is supported by the spectre of Golden Dawn in Greece, which speaks for much of the anti-EU people there. Lenin's writing on the United States of Europe was from a different time. One of his arguments is that it was almost impossible, and if possible would be temporary. Well, today we have the EU, that is a reality. Of course he was right that it would be temporary. And this agrees with the MIM analysis that the EU can't just endlessly assimilate more nations because they are attempting to bring proletarian nations into the imperialist sphere. But the percentage of the population that can live at the level of imperialist nations is limited, and requires a certain percentage of exploited people to support it.  Unequal Exchange is merely one mechanism of surplus value extraction. Cope certainly says as much. But would a population necessarily need to be net exploiters to benefit from unequal exchange? The European imperialist countries were dominated by proletarians for much of their imperialist days. So even if one argued that unequal exchange is a law of imperialism, that does not mean that majority exploiters in imperialist countries is."

Humans don't go into grocery stores and rank various items according to utility functions in their heads. People do, however, spend a lot more time thinking about the conditions of their employment. Neoclassical economics wants to put the focus on the point of exchange for tootsie rolls and deodorant. Marxist economics puts the point of focus on the conditions under which people earn their livelihoods.

You might start with drawing up a map of all the languages in the world, and then from there, further subdivide this map based on nations that speak the same language. For instance, the Irish speak English, but they are considered a separate nation. If MIM was drawing the map of North America, there would be no border separating Canadians and Americans.

And 83% for Doctoral, respectively.  Which is interesting when coupled with how private enterprises have gone from being 10.7% of the Chinese economy in 2003 to 45.8% in 2011.  Clearly they value skilled labour more than college education.  There's also interesting bits about the decline of schools, government agencies and research institutes (dropping to 13.3% in 2011), whilst simultaneously seeing the rise of private enterprises and foreign corporations reaching 76.1% in terms of how many graduates are absorbed into these organisations.  All of this goes very well with the info in this article about Worker Democracy vs Privatisation.   From the early 1990s, the CCP committed itself to a neoliberal development strategy. This showed itself in a string of important policy statements declaring that the SOE sector was overburdened with social welfare obligations to workers, pensioners, and their families (Lau 1999; 1999a). The Party-State declared it could no longer afford such social debts if the Chinese economy were to develop competitively in world markets. In absolute numbers, the majority of SOEs (i.e. small and medium sized ones) would be ‘let go’ and left to sink or swim in private markets after the state allowed them ‘autonomy.   Also there's some insight into what the starting salaries are like out there for graduates in 2003 vs 2011. The starting salary for a graduate in 2003, for instance was 元 1564 ( about $252) and grew to 元 2394 (roughly $385) in 2011 for an average growth rate of 5.4%.

Listing her in any 'Left-Communist Reading Guide' would be essential.  As for Rubin, if it wasn't for Rubin's Essays on Marx's Labour Theory of Value, you wouldn't find Left-Communists blabber on and on about how every communistic experiment didn't 'abolish the value form' because he was the man who wrote a treatise that focused on that aspect of Marx's economic theory."

Now that I think of it, there's a big overlap between the leftcoms I see on FB and those interested in Rubinite value theory.  In that vein, Rubin's links to leftcom are much less with traditional leftcom and more with 'communization' theory popular in the 1970s (there's a good Endnotes essay on this I can share if anyone is interested). It's not a totally undue conflation, but putting Rubin on the same list as Pannekoek is quite a leap in theoretical focus."

This essay aims to expose and dismantle that myth by examining some writings of council communists, particularly those of the Dutch Group of International Communists and Anton Pannekoek, and comparing them with Karl Marx’s own writings on post-capitalist labor-time accounting. Through this process, I hope to show that the myth about council communism is fundamentally based on a misrepresentation of Marx’s stance on these issues. In order to understand the similarities and revolutionary perspectives of Marx’s and the council communists’ analyses, it is necessary to dispel the myths about Marx’s own views, and to emphasize his distinction between measurement of labor under capitalism by “value,” and measurement of socialist “directly social labor” by time.

communism,3ddhyc,Hlafdige,13,Wed Jul 15 12:31:39 2015 UTC,The only party with any kind of plan is the KKE. The left platform's plan is a bad joke. And yet people would rather support irrelevant groups of 20 people or parts of the party that is currently stabbing them in the back that rethink their own ideas. Amazing how sectarianism can make people go insane.
communism,3ddhyc,smokeuptheweed9,6,Wed Jul 15 15:19:52 2015 UTC,"In my thinking, the question isn't so much whether or not the KKE is capable of revolution, but whether the Greek nation will go along with it. The Greek nation is at a cross-roads; staying within the imperialist European Union means austerity, period. The powers that rule Europe have called all the bluffs of the ""Left"" political establishment of Greece. Refusing austerity means going it alone, perhaps with some support from Russia and China, but fundamentally alone.  If the Greek nation is incapable of accepting the need for socialism and a centrally planned economy as the only alternative to EU imposed austerity, then nothing is gonna change. They will get the austerity they choose, by refusing to accept the only alternative. The best the KKE could do, IMO, is try to convince the masses of Greece that central planning is a better alternative than EU imposed austerity, that they are better off outside the imperialist coalition that is the European Union than inside it.  The upper classes and whatever the composition of the Greek labor aristocracy is, will generally not accept this. A centrally planned economy isn't going to benefit them more than going along with austerity will. In fact, it will probably mean lower wages for the highest paid workers, and the crushing of petty-bourgeois aspirations entirely. Whether or not socialism can happen to Greece depends on how many people could actually stand to benefit from what a centrally planned economy can offer them (basically guaranteed employment, housing, medical care and education). How many of the Greek masses would see this as not just as an acceptable alternative to their present condition, but as something desirable to what they have now? My guess is not a majority, who would probably rather take their chances in a market economy.  This would be the social-base on which the KKE could win mass support and transform the economy along socialist lines (which will be absolutely necessary, as rejecting austerity while looking for a capitalist solution outside the EU is certainly a death sentence for the Greek economy). Those outside this social-base will form the breeding ground for fascism, which will almost certainly be nurtured from the get-go by the EU and the US.  Greece looks to be the weak-link in the imperialist chain, just like ass-backwards Russia was about 100 years ago. Whether or not the chain will break depends on what kind of future the Greek masses see within the imperialist Euro-Union.  My guess is there is at least another couple years left worth of distracting antics SYRIZA and SYRIZA-like parties can do to force austerity on the Greek nation and keep them in the European Union. The longer this goes on, the more sharp the eventual break will be. If the imperialists thought in the long term, they would encourage a Grexit now, while it would be mucher easier to spread fascism in the Greek population, than 2-3 years from now, when the Greek nation has become totally fed up with pseudo-""Left"" political parties, and potentially even fascist parties doing the bidding of the EU."
communism,3ddhyc,Rangrul,8,Wed Jul 15 17:35:14 2015 UTC,"The Communist Tendency has an ten point programme for socialism.    Amazing how sectarianism can make people go insane.   We say the same thing when the KKE calls the majority of the working class ""bourgeois"" and ""anti-people""; or when the KKE refuses to even rally with the majority of the working class; or when the KKE refuses to consider going into coalition with Syriza thus paving the way for the right-wing ANEL; or when the KKE tells its supporters not to participate in the mass politics of the working class.  The Communist Tendency of Syriza has always been comradely towards the KKE.

What is the class makeup in greece in various industries and how much actual productive labor is done in Greece? How could an isolated Greece prevent shortages of goods, raw materials, or food? What are concrete steps towards international solidarity and cooperation with other communist parties beyond proclamations? Are there plans to nationalize the economy and collectivize agriculture, and how would this be implemented?  These are the questions serious communists ask, not liberals interested in feeling morally superior. The KKE actually debates these issues and has a specific understanding of the level of class consciousness required for a socialist revolution and how to get there (it won't happen until Greece is inevitably kicked out of the Euro). The communist tendency of SYRIZA is more interested in sectarianism and feeling important than making a broad anti-austerity front if they can't stomach being part of the KKE.   e: also lol @ blaming the KKE for not joining a coalition with SYRIZA when they accurately predicted that SYRIZA would capitulate worse than PASOK or ND."

Also, really, your statement is logically in the same league with ""Pointing out racism is racist"". It isn't, nor is /u/Hlafdige's statement sectarian.   KKE have always been ridiculously sectarian. It's not that they didn't coalition with SYRIZA that made them sectarian. It's that they constantly take up sectarian initiatives that makes them sectarian. Holding marches separate to everyone else. Proposing different motions which are identical to everyone else's because they refuse to support any ideas that aren't theirs. Holding separate meetings on the same issue and the same time everyone else is.    It doesn't take a genius to realise that this attitude is firstly, shitty, and secondly going to reduce your support base. Radicalised workers don't want to be alienated from the working class as a whole, as the KKE is. All you need do is study their trends in elections and opinion polls which have constantly been on the downturn to the point that if there was an election tomorrow they'd barely meet quota to enter.   In absence of figures on their membership itself, we can only say this isn't the sign of a party which has made the correct analysis to attract workers to its banner. Its approach of rejecting cooperation with SYRIZA on good initiatives has driven radical workers away from them - the party not doing anything - and into SYRIZA. If they had decided to cooperate with SYRIZA on a basis of opposing austerity, things would've been different. SYRIZA's capitulation now doesn't make up for that. Of course KKE can't cooperate with SYRIZA anymore, and now their analysis which they've held all these months is applicable because SYRIZA as a vehicle for working class power is over. But their analysis in general has been woefully inadequate.   Like really, people talk about the perfect KKE analysis, well fine, let's concede that for a moment. What have they done given this analysis? Pretty much nothing. The strike action yesterday was the first actual fight they put up. They didn't even mobilise for the referendum, which was just a bad idea in every way.  KKE missing from the mass movements in the backdrop of the referendum and the struggles against the Troika generally are going to be remembered, and not fondly."
communism,3ddhyc,Kiibakun,4,Thu Jul 16 10:33:21 2015 UTC,"Cooperation with Syriza could never have led to anything but defeat because Syriza's line was simply self-defeating. The only way for this hypothetical cooperation to have ""worked"" would have been for Syriza to adopt a different line. That simply wouldn't have happened. Look at how the Left platform ultimately never steered Syriza policy, never had any real influence, never actually made a difference in any important matter. The pro-Syriza left never took the social-democrat majority in Syriza seriously, nor did they take seriously the words of the people actually in control of Syriza. KKE (and Antarsya and some anarchists) did.  The KKE also has a lot more influence among radicalised workers, in the sense of actual factory and lower class workers, than you think. It actually has a lot more mobilising potential than Syriza, because KKE is a party built on hard organisational work and a strong presence in the trade unions. Syriza has (had) the support of the a larger part of the people in a cross-class sense, as a ""people's movement"", but none can deny the obvious strength of the KKE among the traditional proletariat.   One more thing: remember that in may 2012 KKE got 8,5% of the vote; the specific configuration of Greek electoral policy (where an extra fifty seats are awarded to the largest party) certainly contributed to Leftwing-voters hopping on the Syriza bandwagon in june 2012. KKE even recovered somewhat in 2015. Consider also that in the recent student elections in may KKE's youth wing got 19% of the vote as opposed to Syriza's 7,5%. I would be very surprised if KKE doesn't show at least modest growth in any upcoming elections."
communism,3ddhyc,stalinist_admin,3,Thu Jul 16 20:06:39 2015 UTC,"I see you have a Trotsky icon beside your name. While I generally dislike Trotskyites, there are a few groups that I think actually approach a genuine Marxist-Leninist line (the Healyites in Britain, the SEP today in America). I believe it is possible to go into the writings of Trotsky and reconstruct a genuine Marxist-Leninist analysis, based on emphasizing certain things, and ignoring other aspects of Trotsky's thinking.  My favorite work of Trotsky is his Trade Unions in the Epoch of Imperialist Decay. Anyone trying to get a Trotskyite to think clearly about the nature of the labor aristocracy and the labor bureaucracy as Marxist-Leninist concepts should begin with this work.   Monopoly capitalism is less and less willing to reconcile itself to the independence of trade unions. It demands of the reformist bureaucracy and the labor aristocracy who pick the crumbs from its banquet table, that they become transformed into its political police before the eyes of the working class. If that is not achieved, the labor bureaucracy is driven away and replaced by the fascists. Incidentally, all the efforts of the labor aristocracy in the service of imperialism cannot in the long run save them from destruction.   What Trotsky is saying here is that a segment of the 'working class' that is bought off with imperialist superprofits, and the labor bureaucracy that represents their interests, are themselves turned into a separate class of sorts, one that fulfills the function of a political police on the workers. This is entirely in keeping with the Marxist-Leninist understanding, but this work is almost never stressed today by any Trotskyite organization. For the most part, Trotskyism only has any popularity to speak of in the Western European countries, and almost all Trotskyite parties have reconciled themselves to the labor aristocracy and the labor bureaucracies of their countries. In effect, most Trotskyite parties in the West have been deputized into the political police force by the labor bureaucracy.  It is within this theoretical framework that the situation in Greece has to be looked at. And it is more than obvious that it is not the KKE playing the role of political police for the workers.  Furthermore, Trotsky was a general in the Red Army. Trotsky, in a polemic with Karl Kautsky he titled Terrorism and Communism, wrote this about the other army he was fighting:   But Kautsky goes further to develop his theme. He complains that we suppress the newspapers of the SRs and the Mensheviks, and even – such things have been known – arrest their leaders. Are we not dealing here with “shades of opinion” in the proletarian or the Socialist movement? The scholastic pedant does not see facts beyond his accustomed words. The Mensheviks and SRs for him are simply tendencies in Socialism, whereas, in the course of the revolution, they have been transformed into an organization which works in active co-operation with the counter-revolution and carries on against us an open war. The army of Kolchak was organized by Socialist Revolutionaries (how that name savours to-day of the charlatan!), and was supported by Mensheviks. Both carried on – and carry on – against us, for a year and a half, a war on the Northern front. The Mensheviks who rule the Caucasus, formerly the allies of Hohenzollern, and to-day the allies of Lloyd George, arrested and shot Bolsheviks hand in hand with German and British officers. The Mensheviks and S.R.s of the Kuban Rada organized the army of Denikin. The Esthonian Mensheviks who participate in their government were directly concerned in the last advance of Yudenich against Petrograd. Such are these “tendencies” in the Socialist movement. Kautsky considers that one can be in a state of open and civil war with the Mensheviks and SRs, who, with the help of the troops they themselves have organized for Yudenich, Kolchak and Denikin, are fighting for their “shade of opinions” in Socialism, and at the same time to allow those innocent “shades of opinion” freedom of the Press in our rear. If the dispute with the SRs and the Mensheviks could be settled by means of persuasion and voting – that is, if there were not behind their backs the Russian and foreign imperialists – there would be no civil war.   This is the context anyone calling themselves a Trotskyist should be thinking about when discussing the attitudes of the KKE toward SYRIZA. It has been proved, over and over and over and over again, in countless countries, that a section of ""Left"" ""radicals"" are active agents of the bourgeoisie. They are not merely people with mistaken ideas in their heads. The Mensheviks and S.R.s in Russia weren't mistaken idiots who could be pulled into the Bolshevik orbit; they were organizing counter-revolutionary terror against the October Revolution. Moreover, they were participating in the Kerensky government, which was continuing to send Russians to fight and die in a war they were completely opposed to.  To say that they KKE should have cooperated with SYRIZA is like saying the Bolsheviks shouldn't have opposed the Kerensky regime, or that Trotsky shouldn't have been organizing the murder of Mensheviks and S.R.s for what they were doing.  It is a failure to recognize the material basis of ideological divisions amongst workers. It really isn't simply a matter of mistaken ideas in the heads of the labor bureaucrats. There is undoubtedly a section of the Greek labor aristocracy who would stand to lose materially if Greece left the imperialist Euro-Union. Imperialism pays higher wages than socialism can, and while Greece is on the margins of the imperialist system and gets less from it than other countries (like the US and Canada), there are undoubtedly a lot of powerful interests, inside and outside the labor movement, who will do anything to keep Greece inside the imperialist orbit."

It's easy to say the left should rally around the KKE when the reality is that the KKE can't drop its sectarianism enough to allow that to happen. It's too sectarian to organise with in a meaningful fashion. Yeah sure you can sometimes stand on a joint list with them in an election, but that's not the same thing.  Sectarianism doesn't disappear just because you pretend it isn't a problem. By demanding the left rally around the KKE whilst rejecting that the KKE must fix its crippling sectarianism, all you are demanding is that the left become the mindless drones of the party. This is absurd for obvious reasons.  KKE has the capability to dangerously organise. This is to its credit. Nobody denies it is a strong party with the potential to form a powerful, mass party with the ability to take power of society. But to do that it either has to win over the rest of the vanguard - the radicalised working class and parties - or it has to crush and assimilate it.   The KKE as the most powerful left party in Greece right now, has the responsibility to reach out to the other sections of the left, establish initiatives on a cooperative basis, and call to those sections of the revolutionary left that are in SYRIZA to break out and join with them in these initiatives. Until it starts making these moves, it cannot achieve its potential. As it stands right now, not only is KKE not making these moves as it should, it rejects others' attempts to do so. It's a sectarian party and it is hindering its own growth and the development of the working class as a result.  You can discuss on and on about the inevitability of SYRIZA's capitulating as long as you want, and I can disagree as long as I want, it certainly doesn't matter now that SYRIZA has capitulated. This still doesn't cover up KKE's own errors, which are serious. These errors also don't cover up KKE's major positive aspects like its organisational strength and discipline.   As Marxists we must not fall into the habit of viewing organisations through a prism of idealism just because they're the least shitty/best option. Open, strong criticism of left organisations - in a comradely fashion - is a necessary aspect of the development of the revolutionary forces.

Here's a guy who slanders the people who refused to participate in the wholesale destruction of their nation in service to bourgeois social-democratic politicians by implying they did it to ""maintain purity.""  Meanwhile this guy helped sell the sell-outs to confused souls on the internet. Don't pretend you didn't! Shouldn't you be hiding in the shame cave?  Maybe the boycott was a bad tactical decision, maybe it wasn't. It was an attempt to ensure KKE was as distant as possible from the impending implosion that was obvious to everyone who could read a balance sheet and understood syriza's commitments, and that's not bad politics.  Besides, a bit of tactical mix-up is like a fleabite compared to the mountain of fuck-up that you signed on to.  We told you so, dipshit!"
communism,3ddhyc,DazedAndConfus3d,-1,Thu Jul 16 05:22:01 2015 UTC,"So now that the KKE has lost influence and the shift to the left may or may nott have peaked, where forward now for the KKE? Is the strategy to continue completely separated from the mass movement. How can the KKE claim betrayal of the referendum when they refused to participate. How will it be now, after refusing to participate in the struggle every step of the way, that the KKE will magically be in the vanguard of the workers' movement? This is ultra left fantasizing."
communism,3ddhyc,pptyx,2,Fri Jul 17 03:39:23 2015 UTC,"Well, let me be the only person to comment on your post without engaging in a shit-fest :)  I really hope the Syriza youth and regional organizations, as they have shown in the last few days, are able to coalesce on their absolute opposition to the national party socdems quitters.  Whether that means a revived Left Platformist Syriza, Anstarsya, KKE, or all three together, as long as it is the working class doing so itself (which is really the only liberating force at this point; no individual politician or party apparatus could do it on their own anyways), I am all for it."
communism,3ddhyc,pptyx,2,Fri Jul 17 02:14:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you :). I think the upvotes speak for the sane and silent bunch on this sub.  I hope so too. As you say, there is huge opposition to the Government's actions in Syriza. The municipal and regional associations, the youth group, the trade unions, the CC and even the Secretariat. The Communist Tendency has just started a petition to convene an extraordinary congress of the party to change policy and leadership, as Article 15 of the Syriza constitution provides for."
communism,3ddhyc,pptyx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:40:36 2015 UTC,"The fact that you discuss in r/communism for Greece and you don't talk about KKE or even Antarsya and you really take account of this ""communist"" tendency can only tell how little to no clue you have of the communist movement in Greece. This tendency inside a burgoise party can be only a joke, a politic troll. The leading group of this party has numerous times pledged vows over the impealistic organisations of Nato and EU and Eurozone. Not a day ago the vice president of goverment and high in the ranks of Syriza actually thanked USA and IMF for been helpfull about the agreement. The only reason this tendency exsists is beacause Syriza once used to a versatile party when it formed and thus they ""couldn't"" and for purposes of propanga they wouldn't exlude any communist faction or tendency that would come their way. This faction like the Left Platform inside Syriza (where at least the Platform have a strong presence in the politburo and the CC and even like 20-25 MPs of the total 149 of Syriza) are just alibis so the party can still associate with the people and the working class. In the best case they are been used when the leading coup inside Syriza seems fit."
communism,3ddhyc,Kiibakun,-1,Thu Jul 16 19:09:55 2015 UTC,"Syriza is not a bourgeois party and there is not a conspiracy to keep a left ""alibi"". Syriza is a reformist, working class party -- the mass working class party in Greece -- which represents the reformist consciousness of the Greek workers. The Communist Tendency attaches themselves to these mass organisations of the working class, to reveal the bankruptcy of reformism and its inevitable betrayal and thus win workers over to revolutionary Marxism once they reach revolutionary class consciousness. Its the strategy of the communist movement as theorised and practiced by Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky."

communism,3ddxt8,amada5,6,Wed Jul 15 14:52:59 2015 UTC,"I love item #4 - Conclusions that are valuable for the people must not be forgotten:   The “tough” negotiation was from the beginning a minefield for the people’s interests, as it served the aim of capital for the recovery of its profitability. Greece’s participation in the EU and the Eurozone remains the strategic choice of the Greek capital and it is characterized by unequal conditions, which objectively exist in such imperialist alliances. In the framework of these alliances, the Greek state is obliged to compromise with the stronger centres, like Germany, thrusting the consequences of these unequal relations onto the workers. These developments constitute the clearest expression of the failure of the so-called “renewed” or “governmental left”, of the theory that the EU can change its monopolistic and anti-people character. They highlighted the collapse of the so-called “anti-memorandum” line that promoted the bourgeois social-democratic aim of the reconstruction of production, without radical changes at the level of the economy and power. The line of struggle of the KKE and its robust and consistent stance, which rejected participation in such “leftwing governments” that are really governments of bourgeois management, have been borne out. As a whole, the processes for the recomposition of the bourgeois political system are accelerating after the recent developments. Either through a reshuffle and possible broadening of the government’s base or through elections and the creation of new parties and “shock absorbers”. In any case, the offensive against the KKE is the consistent choice of the system, so that the people’s indignation does not join with the anticapitalist antimonopoly line of struggle. A new anti-people alliance of the “willing” is being raised against the people in order to impede any spirit of resistance and emancipation. Today, the intensification of state and employer repression is rearing its head threateningly, as well as the increase of authoritarianism, in order to prevent the organization of the labour movement and its allies and the development of the class struggle."

communism,3ddxt8,Rangrul,4,Thu Jul 16 11:00:30 2015 UTC,"Hence I post this excellent article here, in admiration of a party which, unlike practically the entirety of the European Left, rejected eurocommunism, rejected the new-left ""radical"" social democracy and stayed shamelessly, proudly communist   Which is why it coalitioned with New Democracy.  Like don't get me wrong KKE are probably one of the best Communist orgs in Europe right now in terms of size, influence and analytical approach, but their nature has changed constantly from really shitty to somewhat good and anywhere in between.   With that in mind there are two problems with your statement. KKE hasn't stayed anything - they've changed quite a bit, taking up views that are bad and good, for example they have a kind of ""Don't Ask Don't Tell"" policy towards homosexuality. But they've also maintained a strong influence in the Unions, which is excellent on their part.  Secondly, the entirety of the European left has also changed in quite a few ways. After the collapse of the USSR the Communist Parties almost entirely across the board bar in Spain and Greece formally changed their stance to what it already was(Social Democracy). But this effected mostly the parties which were firmly in the sphere of the USSR and considered it, officially, Socialist. The other parties across Europe - smaller, yes - took hits but they maintained their Marxist outlook, or lapsed into a right ward shift and then crawled their way back to the left.  I think KKE is seriously misrepresented in an extremely idealistic way on both sides. A serious discussion needs to be had on the left broadly on our orientation towards them with the failure of SYRIZA's right wing leadership and these portrayals of the KKE being the ""One True Communiststm "" are not constructive to that conversation."
communism,3ddxt8,PoblachtObrithe,8,Wed Jul 15 16:05:32 2015 UTC,"Which is why it coalitioned with New Democracy.   The KKE purged all those people in 1991, and promptly left Synaspismos"

communism,3ddxt8,edruro,6,Wed Jul 15 16:36:56 2015 UTC,"See Papariga's The KKE’s experience since the early 1990s:   The KKE went through its own internal crisis early in the 1990s, during which our country’s bourgeois forces intervened actively. They openly supported that group of party cadres, particularly the members of the CC, whose aim was to dissolve the KKE and to merge it in a leftist form of collaboration that celebrated the defeat of the forces of socialism. Then it appeared possible that, by marginalising or dissolving the KKE, the view that socialism is utopian would prevail, and therefore that the main and basic issue was to humanise capitalism. It is not accidental that ever since then, we in Greece frequently hear about totalitarian capitalism, savage capitalism, extreme capitalism, and capitalism that discredits itself through its own barbarity. There is no greater utopia than going back to the period of the dawn of capitalism, to the period of the French Enlightenment and Romanticism, which became outdated a long time ago owing to the evolution of history. Nor of course can social-democratic prescriptions of a Keynesian or neo-Keynesian type provide solutions to the people’s critical problems, to militarization and the imperialist war. Today the laws and trends inherent in the capitalist mode of production cannot possibly be ignored. The solution can be found by going forward to socialism, which must today be enriched with the experience of building socialism in the 20th century, with the prerequisite of its objective scientific evaluation and critical review, wherever required.  The schism that appeared in the party was nothing more than a confrontation between right opportunism and the Party forces that, irrespective of international developments, continued to believe in the necessity of the revolutionary struggle for socialism and communism.  In 1991 the KKE was obliged to take a stand against unbridled anticommunism, against a series of attacks on it that bore some features of political intrigue. It was obliged, under conditions of retreat and the reduction of its forces, to stand on its own, to respond without delay to the need to organise resistance by the labour and popular movement to the first wave of privatisations, to the revocation of gains that had begun with the New Democracy government, and to the war that broke out in the Balkans."
communism,3ddxt8,PoblachtObrithe,6,Wed Jul 15 16:57:21 2015 UTC,"Spaniard here. Spain's traditional Communist Party (PCE) drifted to social democracy, and it is now inside a social democrat party that it is about to disappear. But there's another Communist Party called People's Communist Party of Spain (PCPE) that maintains Marxist-Leninism thesis and is country-wide. Actually, PCPE is a good ally of KKE and one of their international collaborators for the International Communist Review publication (http://www.iccr.gr/).  Source: I'm a member of said party."
communism,3ddxt8,edruro,2,Wed Jul 15 18:32:37 2015 UTC,"I have friends in PCE who share a different perspective entirely. PCE did take a Eurocommunist turn but ousted that leadership. Electorally the party - through IU - is under threat from Podemos but it being ""about to disappear"" is not correct. PCE still has a huge membership, especially when taken relative to PCPE."
communism,3ddxt8,PoblachtObrithe,7,Wed Jul 15 18:35:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know what happens in other territories but in mine, the youth organization of the PCE has indeed a decent amount of people, but very few of them, if any, actually starts their militancy in PCE after they grow. The majority prefers to work for IU directly, where they can have more resources to do political work.  But, anyways, it's not a problem of how many people you have, if you don't have political independence, you have no reason to exist. That's why I choose to enter PCPE instead. Hell, PCE even was forced to align with Syriza instead of KKE in the past.   Many people here believes that IU will disappear, or at least, will expel PCE before joining Podemos. They already made a competing platform called ""Ahora en comun"". I sincerely hope for a future joining congress between the most honest people of PCE outside IU and PCPE, but for now I have to believe on ourselves alone."
communism,3ddxt8,edruro,2,Wed Jul 15 18:47:16 2015 UTC,"Well, PCE requires membership and participation in IU, so it's only logical that that's the focus of their activities. I think the day IU expels PCE from anything is the day by fingers expel my arm, so to speak.   We do a similar thing here in Ireland where we have broader formations which we are focused on growing to get workers mobilised again. With regards to Ahora En Común, I thought PCE was involved in/approving of that formation as well?"
communism,3ddxt8,Kiibakun,4,Wed Jul 15 19:03:29 2015 UTC,"Ahora en común is a little confusing so far. It seems leaded by a former UJCE (PCE's Youth) member, now candidate to lead IU, but it has a lot of members that are not even from IU, including former PSOE militants and people tired of Podemos' shenanigans and leader cult."

There's also a (fictional) film that you may find interesting called The Legend of Rita which is about a RAF type group that is on the run and ends up in the GDR, so much of the film is about life in the GDR.

This is just not wise. The world revolution is a continuous process which has its ups and downs, but once it started (since the Paris Commune in 1871) it will unfold until the ultimate world-historical victory, because Marxian analysis of capitalism is still correct. Given today's situation, we need some serious theoretical work (there were a lot of attempts already) and then rebuilding of communist movements in different countries.  I know I abuse historical references, but since I study party history this is perhaps inevitable. Today's situation is not in fact new. Very similar thing happened in 1914 when Second International collapsed, its leaders betrayed their ideas and only a few social-democrats remained true to real Marxism. Among those stubborn dogmatists and sectarians was an obscure Russian political party called 'the Bolsheviks' and its leader, a small, insignificant middle-aged man, who lived in utter poverty in Switzerland with his wife. His name was, of course, Lenin."

The early chapters of the book are more for setting up some of the theoretical frameworks that are expounded upon in later chapters.    I'm pointing this out 'cause I was a bit irritated reading the last section of Chapter 2, on how capitalism can't ""green"" itself, because I didn't think he did a good job at all of supporting that thesis; but it was only until I read through Chapters 4 and 5 and then skimmed back through Chapter 2 that I realized that Biel intended that section to be an introduction to the ideas.    So yeah, Chapters 1-3 are really a rather long introduction to the theoretical frameworks, whereas the later chapters delve into the empirical history and contemporary situation."

communism,3cyzmq,DrunkDemon,6,Sat Jul 18 03:55:09 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Chapter 3 is really where this book starts to shine, because it starts to move away from theoretical outlines and solidly into analyzing history and empirical analysis.    I think Biel's analysis of the ""systemic turn"" is really quite excellent; in one sense, its a continuation of what has been stated about neoliberalism all along (that its a more decentralized and deregulated form of capitalism), but his analysis of neoliberal deregulation (or rather, re-regulation, since it was really just a transformation of capitalist regulatory systems rather than their abolition) in the context of entropy and systems theory really clarifies the deeper nature of this systemic turn, as one that was arguably necessary for capitalism to evolve/devolve in order to escape the social crisis of the '60s, by parasiting off of naturally emergent networks and human creativity.    Now I might be confusing this argument with one that appears in another chapter, but I thought another great aspect of the ""emergent network/system"" idea was its relationship with energy.  Biel argues that emergent systems are inherently more sustainable than top-down systems not only because they are able to access complexity (and thus, adaptability) more readily, but also because there is less of an energy sink into the top-down management structure.  Any centralized system requires energy inputs to be able to properly process information and sustain its institutions; this is energy that is not being put into the local/emergent level.  And in particular, there is a key threshold where institutions of top-down management are expending more energy in controlling emergent systems than they are gaining from such systems, where instability and repressive functions starts to take over.  This is an idea Biel fleshes out more thoroughly in Chapter 5, in the context of imperialism."
communism,3cyzmq,DrunkDemon,2,Sun Jul 12 05:33:51 2015 UTC,"(or rather, re-regulation, since it was really just a transformation of capitalist regulatory systems rather than their abolition)   This is especially interesting. /u/DrunkDemon mentioned below that Biel neglects ""the ways capitalism is still centralizing through the process of capital accumulation, ie what Samir Amin has termed 'generalized oligopoly capitalism', and how they constitute a dual process at this point"". Perhaps what has happened then is, to adapt your terms, a transformation of capitalist centralizing systems rather than their abolition - a transformation in where and what ways centralization occurs. Does Biel discuss this?"
communism,3cyzmq,inngrinder,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:51:13 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, he doesn't talk about this. I believe that his discussion of capitalism centralizing after this point focuses on the difficulties of recentralization after emergent forces have been released. I think that this perhaps one area of the book where Biel takes a more mechanical approach in his analysis, but also that your interpretation is very valid and shows that his analysis is still quite strong, though perhaps needs more fleshing out."
communism,3cyzmq,DrunkDemon,3,Sat Jul 18 15:59:25 2015 UTC,"I found chapter 3 the most interesting one so far, so I'll focus on it for now. One passage that particularly struck out to me was at the beginning of page 85:   But the main method [for facilitating the 'systemic turn'] is probably that the large-scale emergent structures like global value chains could be used to contain the small-scale ones, thus forcing all local initiatives into the mould of self-exploitation in the wider interests of capital accumulation.   What I find remarkable about this is the way that it could be inverted to apply to socialist construction- the emergent society at large regulates the small scale emergence to combat bourgeois hegemony. In other words, Biel's use of emergence to describe socialist society is completely compatible with a mass-line practice. While unfortunately having read through the book already, when Biel concretizes his discussion of socialist emergence it leaves this aspect out, but that makes it more important to highlight this snippet of that aspect now.  This chapter strongly focuses on how capitalism has allowed for some decentralization, which I think is crucial for understanding imperialism's qualitative development. But at the same time, I think it perhaps pays too little time exploring how this relates to the ways capitalism is still centralizing through the process of capital accumulation, ie what Samir Amin has termed 'generalized oligopoly capitalism', and how they constitute a dual process at this point. At the same time the book still manages to be extremely useful in understanding contemporary capitalism because it, arguably unlike Samir Amin's most recent work, avoids the trap Amin himself previously recognized in his work Class and Nation of developing theory that has merely descriptive value."

Newton from the Huey P. Newton Reader:   We also say that every determination is a limitation, and every limitation is a determination. This is the struggle of the old and new again, where a thing seems to negate itself. For instance, imperialism negates itself after laying the foundation for communism, and communism will eventually negate itself because of its internal contradictions, and then we’ll move to an even higher state. I like to think that we will finally move to a stage called “godliness,” where man will know the secrets of the beginning and the end and will have full control of the universe —and when I say the universe, I mean all motion and matter.

Opportunism does NOT equal infighting. Infighting equals infighting, opportunism equals opportunism. They are two separate things. As for your '""petty bourgeouise"" refusing to start up'? Where did you get that? Trotsky clearly says ""its petty bourgeois cowardice"", i.e. the proletarian leadership is cowardly and that cowardice can be characterised as  petty bourgeois in nature.  And no, he isn't suggesting that the petty bourgeoisie is what currently controls the Proletarian leadership. What he is saying is that the Proletarian leadership, at the time he was writing, has a treacherous connection to the big bourgeoisie. Meaning that the proletarian leadership, even as the big bourgeoisie dies, will seek to defend it.  Sorry to be so harsh, but the quote is pretty plain english.

In Canada, even though statistics do not allow us to define it with accuracy, the proletariat represents 65% of the population. This figure comprises workers; employees who carry out orders; the unemployed, with or without wages; most Natives; old age pensioners; unpaid spouses of workers or employees.  Far from being a class on the decline or having “disappeared,” the proletariat constitutes the most numerous class in this country. Not only is it the leading force, but it is also the main force of the revolution.”[13]  This claim of 65% of the population is based on what? Where do they get this number from? What data could be used to confirm or even support this? They don’t provide any. In fact, they openly contradict themselves in defining what proletarian is. Previously they said proletariat was, “a class whose existence is defined by its role in the relations of production”. Since they are clearly holding onto the original meaning so that First World people can remain proletarian, we have to ask why they list certain groups that would not fit that definition. Old age pensioners, the unemployed, and unpaid spouses are not proletarian according to the original definition they are holding onto. They have no relationship to the means of production as they are not employed, thus not even being exploited by capitalism."

communism,3cih9f,VoteStalin2016,7,Wed Jul 8 18:23:29 2015 UTC,"At first glance, the etymology of the word “consent” seems somewhat benign. The word first appeared in English in the 13th century, derived from the Old French word consente, meaning “agreement” or “permission.”3 But the word took on an interesting new content when it entered into western, liberal philosophy. Seventeenth century liberal thinkers such as Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau embedded the term “consent” in their theories of the “social contract.”4 “Consent” for these thinkers was the source of legitimacy for governments; in other words, the basis of legitimate power for the liberal philosophers was that the people consent to be governed. In large part because of this trend, in the liberal tradition, the word “consent” came to effectively describe acceptance of dominance. In form, “consent” retained its meaning as describing an “agreement” between ostensibly equal parties, but its content was fundamentally marked by the purpose for which it was appropriated: to describe and legitimate relations of power.   That was probably my favorite bit. It made me realize how ""consent"" is to rape what wage-labor is to slavery. As marxists we see how hollow the supposed voluntarism of capitalism is. Settling for mere consent instead of more concrete liberation should be equally as unsatisfying."
communism,3cih9f,iskandarios,4,Wed Jul 8 18:48:41 2015 UTC,"It's also interesting for me to relate that back to the ever present liberal lie ""all men are created equal"", if we as socialists ever took that statement at face value our analysis would never progress beyond liberalism.  But I've started to notice that liberalism's greatest tendency is to obscure oppressive relations, and to, when challenged, adapt and then obscure some more. It's like the difference between outright slavery and wage-labor (as you mentioned), outright colonialism and neo-colonialism, and many more examples.  It's really interesting that this deception is a unifying theme of liberalism since the beginning of Capitalism."
communism,3cih9f,StWd,3,Wed Jul 8 19:05:36 2015 UTC,China Mieville's Between Equal Rights has a great analysis of formal equality under capitalism (which is necessary for commodity exchange) and how it preserves inequality and exploitation.

If someone regrets or feels depressed after having sex does the author mean to say that this is also rape and the person they had sex with raped them? It doesn't really make it clear in the article if this is what they mean either."
communism,3cih9f,StWd,7,Wed Jul 8 19:40:40 2015 UTC,"As I read it, the author is giving this as evidence that the line at which sex becomes rape is not as clear-cut as presented by liberal feminism, because even in 'consensual' sex there is the ever-present power imbalance that the author suggests leads to postcoital dysphoria."
communism,3cih9f,Paradoxius,4,Thu Jul 9 05:20:52 2015 UTC,"I understand that, but is this really a fair evaluation? If the non-man in question can't  understand why their own feelings of post-coital blues happens, then looking for biological explanations seems like a rational approach to identifying the problem. They don't really offer another explanation or clarify what they mean by this either- I did understand they were trying to infer it but it's not clear. Do non-men feel like they are somehow letting their gender down by having enjoyed being objectified in the act? Is it some sort of existential pang about the predicament of being subjugated by men while simultaneously needing them to reproduce despite it also reproducing patriarchal structures? I feel like non-men would be able to explain these kinds of reasons for having post-coital blues and by not saying this the author does non-men a disservice or worse, insults their intelligence and capacity for self-knowledge.   edit: Just to also be clear, and I think you'll all agree, in the article the bit about how liberals treat sex like a contract in which once it's signed anything goes, is completely bullshit. I don't think liberals believe this either but many who would abuse this definition try to argue for it. I think that it's perfectly acceptable for a person, of any gender/sex/disposition to change their mind during sex and if the person they are with refuses, then it is sexual assault. Eg, man ""tests"" non-man's willingness to engage in anal without talking about it or they try and s/he doesn't like it and wants to stop and he says s/he'll get used to it- maybe s/he eventually does and enjoys it towards the end, I could understand this resulting in post-coital blues because once s/he is ""calm"" and normal thinking returns they might realise that the point before they enjoyed it, they were being raped."
communism,3cih9f,Vacuumulus,3,Thu Jul 9 09:24:36 2015 UTC,"I'd say it has more to do with the idea that the same gender-based structures that make rape what it is are still in play during non-rape sex.  That there is an inherent bias in our society in the fundamental way that sex works, not just the way some people carry it out."
communism,3cih9f,Steelbolt,3,Thu Jul 9 16:23:30 2015 UTC,"My first issue with this article is its etymological section. It acknowledges that the etymology of the word ""consent"" is completely benign, and then continues to slam it for its usage by liberal authors in the ""consent of the governed"". It further claims that this appropriated meaning has become its modern definition and that all consent is a concession of power. This is ludicrous - if you take the time to read any legal document you'll see rich, powerful men ""consenting"" all the time. Consent is merely a word, and it is completely asinine to try to discredit the concept of consent using the vocabulary that describes it.  The article then proceeds to use data from scientific studies while completely discounting any conclusions that the researchers came up with regarding hormonal and chemical issues or evolution. This picking and choosing of scientific research demonstrates complete disregard of one of the most elementary facts of the universe, which is also a core tenet of Marxism - materialism. Human beings are material, as are all of our thoughts, emotions, and of course, our sexuality. We cannot ignore the material reality around us while playing close attention to social relations, as social relations are a product of material reality.  It is complete nonsense to say that reproduction has nothing to do with sexuality. The main reason that organisms with sexual dimorphism engage in sexual is reproduction. Humans and other highly intelligent animals have expanded the purpose of sex to serve a social purpose which incorporates non-reproductive sexuality (which is a good thing - don't get me wrong), but it is inherently reproductive.  The article then proceeds to talk about how men commonly have fantasies of dominating, while females fantasise about being dominated. How men prefer docility. How men critique a woman's appearance as soon as they meet her. I completely agree that these are issues that are embedded deeply within our culture, but I don't see how any of this at all discredits the notion of consent. A woman that is completely docile will always consent - this is not at all what consent is about, and the consent given by such a woman wouldn't be consent at all. Consent is about the choice to say yes for any reason, and no for any reason.  One of my major issues with this article is when the  author claims that the definition of femininity is to exist solely for the purpose of male pleasure, and that women as a gender exist only in their patriarchal relationship with men. This completely discounts the fact that many people who have male chromosomes actually identify as women and wish to change their bodies to reflect this. There is no reason that anyone would ever want to let go of a ""hammer constructed by and for men"" so they could be oppressed and objectified. Gender is not a product of the patriarchy, but a product of sexual dimorphism, which is an integral part of human biology.  I think the part of the article that I most vehemently disagree with, however, is that all sex plays a role in reproducing gender oppression (the phrasing here is a bit ironic; earlier in the article it was claimed that sex is not at all about reproduction). While sex can and too often is used as a tool for domination and control, it is on a biological level a tool for reproduction and on a social level a tool for bonding. I think that to write off all sex this way is in direct opposition to the idea that women should be able to decide for themselves what sex is good and what sex is bad. To deny them this is sexist and oppressive.  As for the section on the butch/femme culture, I actually saw some of the author's points. On the other hand, if two women wish to make their relationship asymmetrical, I believe that there is no issue. Oppression is the suppression of freedom of choice, not diversity. By arguing that all homosexual partners should be the exact same in terms of gender is in direct opposition with the concept of diversity. Just as we accept hetersexual  relationships and homosexual relationships, we should also accept butch/femme homosexual relationships.  The claim that no lifestyle is subversive to the patriarchy is interesting, to say the least. Okay, what's the point of writing this if you are never going to change anything? So of course the author argues that the entire system must be thrown out - a valid point. However, how does one get rid of the patriarchy? There's no ""Ministry of Patriarchy"". There's not some politician who can be overthrown. Patriarchal and heteronormative culture can only be gotten rid of in one way, and that is by a vast majority of society living a lifestyle that is not in conformance with it.  I get that article is trying to argue that whether or not sex is rape should be gauged not by consent but by whether or not it is harmful or degrading, but what alternative is there? I completely agree that if a woman consents to sex and then later realised that she's made a horrible mistake, that's not a problem with her. We all do things that we regret, and people who have made bad decisions should be supported at every turn. On the other hand, it is in no way fair to punish others for their mistakes. I was really hoping that the author would have at least some ideas on what could replace the concept of consent, but all that was said was essentially ""We need to think about it"".  I think the author's main fallacy here is the argument that people who advocate for the concept of consent don't care about how a woman feels as long as she consents. This is not at all the case. I agree that not all consensual sex is good, but believe that consent is not the source of exploitative sexual relations. The true issue lies with women giving consent when they really don't want to. We need to tell women that they don't have to give consent. We need to tell them that it's up to them. The issue doesn't lie in consent itself, but in the fear that many women have to exercise their right to say ""no""."

communism,3ci7uj,jakehmw,3,Wed Jul 8 02:45:52 2015 UTC,"My question is: What is the Marxist response to the claim that 'speciesism is the root of all existing struggles'?   There's a glaring flaw in his argument: temporal priority does not entail causal priority. Just because children are taught speciesism first (an empirical claim that he doesn't provide evidence for and is doubtful - racism and sexism are taught incredibly early) doesn't mean it is the root in a causally significant sense. This also obviously depends on how he's defining ""speciesism"". I adhere to the anti-speciesism of Peter Singer, which is just the idea that species membership per se is not morally significant. Anti-speciesism in that sense is actually compatible with racism and sexism."
communism,3ci7uj,MasCapital,3,Wed Jul 8 05:48:52 2015 UTC,"I think this has more to do with speciesism being the first kind of structural oppression to emerge, historically, not being the one we teach children first. Regardless of that you are still right that temporal priority does not entail causal priority, and class struggle is still primary in a wider sense for Marxists (but of course other struggles can temporally become more important in certain contexts).  And FWIW speciesism typically just means to discriminate (negatively) based on the species of the individual, so yeah, anti-speciesism would be roughly comparable to antiracism or antisexism."

communism,3ci7uj,MasCapital,6,Wed Jul 8 08:21:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think you are right, they are definitely different in important ways. The few Marxists I've read that cover this (unfortunately not many do) basically claim that anti-speciesism emerges as a growing trend in the imperialist countries for basically two reasons: a) the separation of people from the animals they (mostly) eat, as the former go to the cities b) the development of the productive forces, which starts to make consuming animal products not mandatory for survival.  So people who only interact with other non human animals as their pets, or in zoos, movies, etc, would start to question how animals are treated as commodities for foods or other animal products, especially considering that in the current situation it's not mandatory to do all those things (ie, you can live a perfectly fine life without doing that). So this would just be another example of the superstructure being shaped by the material base, and how our relation to other species is mediated historically instead of being some kind of eternal truth (humans are just superior and can do whatever they want with any other species, etc). Perhaps one thing to think about would be: consider that the vast majority of people living in imperialist countries today are not anti-speciesist, but I'd say a big majority already have developed a kind of ""morality"" that makes them appalled when they see what happens in slaughterhouses or the like (this is why filming what goes on in there is so tightly controlled).

What you are actually arguing is that the fact that you fancy (lots of) cow meat, or any other animal meat, has infinitely more priority than the right of those animals to not be brutally tortured for months or years, slaughtered, and served to you like any other commodity. So you are giving more priority to your preference for a particular type of proteins than the right to live and not be enslaved or tortured of sentient animals. Just because humans ""do more for human society"", whatever the hell that means.

However, it's only unrelated for Marxists explicitly bound to focusing on class conflict.   I, along with other anti-speciesist Marxists, focus both on class conflict and species conflict. Anti-speciesist Marxists realize that communism still commoditizes life via carnism. As Marxists, we should stand against the commoditization of any life because of its resulting problems. Carnism takes away resources from feeding humans and feeds it to animals that can only feed around 50% of the human population. Carnism is one of the leading factors in climate change and damages our environment. Communists that are carnist can't solve these problems since they still continue to commoditize life. The factory system in foods won't be done away with in communism since most communists regard animals as property--a commodity.

communism,3ce99l,jmp3903,5,Tue Jul 7 17:02:24 2015 UTC,"Some things for you to consider.  As a Marxist we should be thinking primarily about the class contradictions, not just every contradiction.  While it is true that there is a contradiction between the claims of liberalism and what capitalism necessarily has to do to enforce the liberal market, and that this is always interesting to interrogate, it is also the case that appeals to the right of the individual to whatever s/he wishes is a libertarian demand and not necessarily communist.  Indeed, liberatarians love pointing out contradiction 2 in order to demand that the US stop being hypocritical and allow for individuals to do whatever they please without the ""nanny state"" interfering.  With this in mind you really should think of the fact that there are already ""uniforms"" regardless of the ones imposed by school: these are the clothes that the capitalist market produces and that often openly represent class positions.  The wealthier students can afford to wear x clothes, the less wealthy students do not have access to the same clothes… then there are the uniforms of cliques that creates social separation, etc., etc.  Uniforms eliminate this social separation.  There are, of course, ways the dressing of class returns even within the uniform, but still…  The young pioneers all war uniforms!  Children in the schools just after the Russian Revolution wore uniforms!  In any case, none of this is to attack your position as a whole but just to encourage you to think through the larger issues, see it as a social rather than individual phenomenon, cut through to the concrete rather than the realm of appearance."
communism,3ce99l,jmp3903,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:49:18 2015 UTC,"As a Marxist we should be thinking primarily about the class contradictions, not just every contradiction.   Yes, that's what I tried to do. (If it doesn't make the sense the way I delivered that idea, please tell me) From my perspective, there are three classes in the school system:    Students Teachers, Janitors, Security, etc. Administration, School Board, etc.    The last two classes are--how I think resemble--the state and its military/police. The state being the administration and the teachers, guards, janitors being the police. The students represent the civilians and, more specifically, the workers. I tried to say that this contradiction removes unity between the workers (the students) and the ruling class (the administration). I don't count the teachers and such as the ruling class because that would be the equivalent to saying the police are the ruling class.    you really should think of the fact that there are already ""uniforms"" regardless of the ones imposed by school: these are the clothes that the capitalist market produces and that often openly represent class positions. The wealthier students can afford to wear x clothes, the less wealthy students do not have access to the same clothes… then there are the uniforms of cliques that creates social separation, etc., etc. Uniforms eliminate this social separation. There are, of course, ways the dressing of class returns even within the uniform, but still…   That is a GREAT point. Sadly, I don't think I can support it (even though I agree with it) since I am a representative of the student body, and the student body does not want uniforms. In the students' eyes, this'll cause me to lose a bond with them since it looks like I'm siding with our conservative school board.   Thank you for the reply, comrade!"
communism,3ce99l,heinzovisky91,7,Tue Jul 7 17:12:05 2015 UTC,"When I say class contradictions I mean the class contradiction of capitalism which is bourgeois-proletariat.  Students are not in themselves a social class; they belong to a variety of classes and class backgrounds so simply siding with students over teachers/admin is not a marxist class position.  In fact, teachers in the public school system represent a working class (though a privileged strata of the working class) since they sell their labour. [In this sense, the administration and board are management who act on behalf of the state.]  So no, students do not represent the workers––this is not a very marxist analysis of society but rather an attempt to hammer students-teachers, which is not a class contradiction fundamental to capitalist society, into a marxist mould.  That is, it is idealist rather than materialist and you should be careful about that.    Point being, you deform reality by trying to make your categories somehow become the class categories outlined by the Marxist tradition which are not meant to be metaphors but the structure of society itself.  And the Marxist tradition is full of work on how students are not their own class, and may or may not side with the proletariat, or how teachers may or may not be the proletariat because (unlike students who do not sell their labour to be students) they are exploited in the concrete sense of the term (waged labour) but also often occupy a privileged position as part of the knowledge economy.  How you think the categories you've outlined ""resemble"" actual social classes is beside the point: they are not these social classes, and there is no relationship of exploitation between the school system and students, even if the latter might function as part of an ideological state apparatus.  Nor are the teachers and janitors police.  The security fits that bill, in some sense, but to claim that educational discipline is identical to the function played by the repressive state apparatus is very incorrect.  When it comes to janitors it is even worse: many janitors are very proletarian, and indeed more proletarian than a lot of students.  Let me put it this way… As someone who is a contract professor at a university, and thus who is casualized labour, I don't give a shit about the supposed contradictions I have between my teaching function and some of my students who resist education.  My contradiction is as a worker, as someone who sells their labour in order to survive, along with other workers in my union who is exploited by the university administration, my employer.  Hence, when I am on strike (which happens once every several years) I can actually chart who my friends and enemies are in the student body: the rich little shits who think that I should just take insecurity and below cost of living pay because they pay tuition, or the students who themselves have to work to afford education and who come from poorer families who usually tend to be the same students who support a strike.  That is, students are not at all proletariat by simply being students, this class actually means something for Marxists: people who sell their labour in order to survive and who have nothing to lose but their chains.  Again, it is not a metaphor.  Your teachers, unlike many students, are working a job to put food on their table and thus in a situation of exploitation: you're in a situation of receiving public education, which mean they're not the workers but just consumers of what the workers (teachers) are producing.  It may be the case that you work a part time job, or that your family is poor, but that is where your class position as proletariat is based, not on being a student.  Just some things for you to think through.  I do realize that you're sixteen and new to a lot of this, and I recall that when I was in highschool and first read the Communist Manifesto I applied it to the classifications of my school, which was material reality, in the same kind of metaphorical (but ultimately inaccurate) way.  It was useful in some ways because it provided me with a language, but it was still inaccurate.  As for your last point: if the school board is indeed reactionary, then don't side with them.  But if you're a representative of the student body, chances are there's a lot of reactionaries you're going to be representing––some who may be opposed to school uniforms!"

Your last half really got to me and made me contemplate the whole method of arguing my point. I understand, now, how I misused classes and I want to thank you for pointing this out.   Though, now I'm at a loss of how I can argue against a conservative dress code using dialectics and Marxism. How would you argue this while keeping Marxism and dialectics intact?   Also, in case I didn't make this clear, there are no uniforms in our school. The dress code is very conservative: short hair for guys, no earrings for girls or guys, pants only, no shorts, no skulls or such on shirts, no dyed hair, etc. They basically want students to look like those cardboard-cutout kids that would appear on PBS and textbooks and such."
communism,3cd9fu,DrunkDemon,7,Tue Jul 7 00:33:18 2015 UTC,"Guevara first travelled to the USSR in 1960. His deputy Orlando Borrego recalled that they visited an electronics factory which did accounts by abacus. Having studied the US-owned Cuban Electricity Company, Shell, Texaco and other corporations which used the latest IBM accounting machines, Guevara was struck by the backwardness of Soviet techniques. He believed that advances achieved by humanity should be adopted without fear of ideological contamination.  With the imposition of the US blockade, Cuba was forced to buy factories from the socialist countries, especially the USSR. This assistance was essential, but the relative backwardness of the equipment clashed with Guevara's desire for advanced technology transfers. He did not criticise the Soviets for this backwardness per se. Rather, he complained about the contradiction between the high level of research and development in military technology and low investment applied to civilian production. He objected to their ideological resistance to appropriating advances made in the capitalist world. This was a costly mistake in terms of development and international competitiveness.[6] For example: 'For a long time cybernetics was considered a reactionary science or pseudo-science... [but] it is a branch of science that exists and should be used'.[7] He added that in the US the application of cybernetics in industry had resulted in automation - an important productive development.   God damn I love this guy. And this also represents one of my deepest views - which is that with the level of technological advancement we have seen in recent years - automation, rapid inventory turnover, and incredible leaps in computing, modeling software, artificial intelligence - creating a planned economy that functions with high efficiency and responds rapidly to evolving needs and situations is most certainly a possibility."

This continuing sharp angle between the leadership and the base will undoubtedly lead to dramatic developments. These comrades are deeply involved in the internal debates and agitate among the workers for a revolutionary socialist program, rather than simply sideline-shouting and demobilizing the workers in the interests of ""revolutionary purity"", as the KKE have tended to do throughout the sordid history of the past 4 years of memoranda and mounting austerity."

If the latter occurs, I don't think that they have the heart or the will to set about building a Hellenic Socialist Republic - which is what the aim of the 'left' in every country should be. They were elected on a pro-EU, pro-NATO, anti-austerity, anti-corruption mandate. They have a excellent political ""power"" in the context of winning parliamentary seats. The real political power that would enable them to mobilise millions to occupy Greek factories and man the barricades when the inevitable reaction arrives simply doesn't exist.

It would make no sense. No one could be a member of it and no one would think they should be a member of it. There would be no male sex to belong to. That doesn’t mean there wouldn’t still be penises and ejaculate and prostate glands and such. It simply means that the center of our selfhood would not be required to reside inside an utterly fictitious category—a category that only seems real to the extent that those outside it are put down.  -- John Stoltenberg, Refusing to Be a Man"
communism,3c9gcj,Steelbolt,-1,Mon Jul 6 11:40:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, cite me a biased source, from someone who doesn't hold a degree in psychology, biology or neurology, that should help advance your case.  Female and male brains have been proven to be structurally different (e.g. http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-mens-brains-are-wired-differently-than-women/). That's not to say that either are inferior/superior to the other, but that gender goes beyond just having a penis or a vagina. Instead of arguing the factually false premise that genders are social constructs, you should be arguing the premise that we are all human, and as such we should be equal, regardless of sex and sexual orientation. At least that's my criticism to the article (and modern feminist movements), for what it's worth."
communism,3c9gcj,marxism-feminism,7,Mon Jul 6 12:09:29 2015 UTC,"false premise that genders are social constructs     Whether or not the two sexes have brains that are ""structurally different,"" the point is that using sex to enforce gender performances is oppressive. It's not about having two equal genders, it's about abolishing gender."
communism,3c9gcj,UpholderOfThoughts,9,Mon Jul 6 17:01:22 2015 UTC,"The point is, that by citing ""sex"" as a justification for ""gender"", you're citing a product of patriarchy as a justification for another product of patriarchy. The biological existence of ""sex"" can't be found 'out there', in nature. Instead, it's a product of humyn reproductive variance and humyn activity. In Sexing the Body, Fausto-Sterling (a professor of Biology, if you're all about 'credentials' here), with a vast array of evidence, identifies six different sexes. But why does society say there are only two? Because it's convenient to patriarchy to deny any variation other than two categories as that helps establish and regulate the two fundamental categories of patriarchy: exploiter and exploited, oppressor and oppressed, ""man"" and ""wo-man"". The denial of all other variance, and hence the enforcement of the social construct of sex, is perhaps most evident in how patriarchy treats ""intersex"" infants:   But one of the most important moments in the sex assignment process happens in the first hours after birth. The case of those considered “intersex” can be illustrative here. Suppose a child is born in a western country who has ovaries on the inside, but a penis on the outside. Alternatively, suppose a child is born with labia and a vagina, but also with testes (once again, these cases are not so uncommon; intersex individuals account for around 2% of all births, and in some regions of the world this rate is considerably higher). The first thing that typically happens is that this situation is declared to be a medical emergency. Think about this for a second. Intersex “conditions” present few if any health risks. There is of course a social stigma associated with any appearance of not fitting rigidly into one of the two sex classes. Yet there is also a social stigma associated with being gay, and we don’t consider homosexuality a “condition” or a “disorder” that needs to be medically treated. Moreover, the treatments used to “correct” intersex characteristics sometimes carry substantial risks, and the long-term effects they have are still relatively ill-researched. The motivation behind “correcting” intersex characteristics is thus not one related to the health of the child, it is entirely one of enforcing the sex binary. Any variance from the rigidly defined “male” and “female” classes is an emergency that must be snuffed out as soon as possible.  -- http://anti-imperialism.com/2014/02/24/on-the-social-construction-of-sex-part-1/      Female and male brains have been proven to be structurally different   Correction: ""female"" and ""male"" brains have been proven to be different under the conditions of patriarchy, by patriarchy. Neuroplasticity is incredible. As the page cited in the original article says:   “You can’t pick up a brain and say ‘that’s a girls brain, or that’s a boys brain’ in the same way you can with the skeleton. They look the same.”  Prof Rippon points to earlier studies that showed the brains of London black cab drivers physically changed after they had acquired The Knowledge – an encyclopaedic recall of the capital’s streets.  She believes differences in male and female brains are due to similar cultural stimuli. A women’s brain may therefore become ‘wired’ for multi-tasking simply because society expects that of her and so she uses that part of her brain more often. The brain adapts in the same way as a muscle gets larger with extra use.  “What often isn’t picked up on is how plastic and permeable the brain is. It is changing throughout out lifetime  “The world is full of stereotypical attitudes and unconscious bias. It is full of the drip, drip, drip of the gendered environment.”"

communism,3c79ba,Leninator,5,Sun Jul 5 15:17:32 2015 UTC,"This article is complete nonsense. Take this gem:   Nor were there in Russia reformist parties like the ALP with deep roots in the working class that were closely linked to the unions. The Bolshevik leaders had great difficulty in coming to grips with the powerful influence of reformism in the West. Indeed, the explanation of reformism that Lenin, Zinoviev and some other Bolshevik leaders developed – the theory of the labour aristocracy – seriously underestimated the strength of reformism and misjudged its character. The theory of the labour aristocracy could lead in certain circumstances to the ultraleft conclusion that the bulk of workers were a seething mass held back from revolutionary action only by a thin layer of so-called labour aristocrats and bureaucrats.   In essence, what this article is trying to do is basically attack the Leninist position on the labor aristocracy. It says Lenin was wrong, that Lenin's analysis of the labor aristocracy is insufficient to understand what is/was going on in the Western capitalist countries.   Hand in hand with this new emphasis, it began to develop an explanation of the strength of reformism in countries like Australia and Britain that was more nuanced than the crude labour aristocracy theory.    It then even provides a footnote to a theoretical attack on the position:   For a detailed critique of the labour aristocracy theory see Tom Bramble, “Is there a labour aristocracy in Australia?”, Marxist Left Review, 4, Winter 2012.   But I guess, what can one expect from Euro-settler Australian Trotskyites expelled from the Wallace Global Funded American ISO."

It makes no secret of that fact, so I'm not sure why you're so shocked by that fact.   I'm not sure why you think that's nonsense though, seeing as you've not provided any theoretical justification.
