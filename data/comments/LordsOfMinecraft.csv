If he was holding it for a friend and did this it would be selfish and plain rude but please remember that he probably enjoys this just as much as you and I collecting. If he owns the item and wants to destroy it he should not be restricted of that right.

LordsOfMinecraft,3dw49a,BionicSlime,19,Mon Jul 20 00:51:40 2015 UTC,"I really don't get how you guys didn't see this coming. You hid things on plots and then told people about them and then are surprised when the plot is wrecked in search of things. I'm going to ask Nisovin to just destroy chests when a plot is abandoned, because you guys have just been goofy about this so far.  It's stupid to hide things anyway, because people with Xray will just get them anyway."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dw49a,Rurikar,11,Mon Jul 20 07:24:17 2015 UTC,"Aw.. I've been leaving chests around the plots I'm restoring filled with building materials, so if the people who follow want to change the plot, they can. This also gets rid of any welcome books or info left in chests, too.  An alternate idea that could work would be to automatically open all iron doors/trapdoors on plots that get abandoned? Sane people don't hide chests in walls or under floors as it'd be a pain in the ass to get to them. This would prevent a lot of plotgriefing as people would just be able to look around as necessary.  Yet another idea is an item that you use and it spends a little gold to let you know how many chests are on a plot and how close you are to the closest. This would prevent griefing by stopping people from trying to get non-existent chests and would instead show them how to find the ones that ARE on the plot. There'd then be no point using xray packs, because you'd already know where the chests are.  The thought of all the chests being destroyed just kinda gets rid of the fun part of the abandoned plots, and whilst that is because of some dicks, it's still sad nonetheless."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dw49a,Hanhula,2,Mon Jul 20 08:33:41 2015 UTC,"One of the things I've enjoyed most when restoring abandoned plots is finding semi-built ones - maybe just a couple of walls and a chest or two, or in one case a bed and a chest - and then improvising my build from the blocks that I found in the chests.  I almost always need to spend some of my own money on it, but there's added fun out of wondering what you'll get to start you off. I've made several pretty wee builds because of that.  (I wonder whether some people buy lots of stuff and are then overwhelmed and don't know what to do with the plot and let it lapse...)"
LordsOfMinecraft,3dw49a,Alderdash,8,Mon Jul 20 09:28:39 2015 UTC,"I think the frustration is coming from those of us who 1) did see this coming and 2) haven't been hiding anything anywhere.  When the 'builds stay' thing first came in, I went round the server for a week or two making small builds, every district except Magic Quarter I think. The wee house I built in Westshire has been wrecked twice despite having nothing hidden anywhere. There's a chest on the plot, but it's furniture in the house, in the open, with a wooden door (which the looters broke! Who breaks down a wood door!? You can just walk in!). There were blocks in the chest that they could've used to replace the grass and floor they broke, but they just messed it up and left.   There's a difference between 'treasure hunting' and this mean-spirited stuff that's been showing up, and that's what's upsetting folk.  It's a real shame if you have to auto-destroy the chests, though I understand that might be the only practical solution at your disposal. I enjoyed leaving a note for the next owner, and some small gifts of food and a red gem or two, as well as any remaining blocks from the build so they'd have a head-start on customising it. And as I said to Hanhula below, finding a chest of blocks when doing plot restoration/renovation was a really fun bonus too - I've built at least one entire house from the blocks left in a chest..."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dw49a,Alderdash,6,Mon Jul 20 09:48:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. I found a few plots that never had any chests were griefed just the other day :/  Things like this were a very minor issue until the ""mythical"" Vault thing came along. In the past 3 days, I've noticed dozens of new people ""exploring"" the Dwarven District daily. At this point, I'm telling treasure hunters I see that the districts been picked over three times by now, and there's nothing worth looting left."

LordsOfMinecraft,3dw49a,Hoonter_Uchiha,4,Mon Jul 20 03:49:55 2015 UTC,It's inevitable that there will be looters. Even appealing to the community for kindness isn't going to get 100% of them. The only thing that I can think of that will change it is for no chests to be left on abandoned plots. :S

LordsOfMinecraft,3dw49a,McENEN,3,Mon Jul 20 06:40:11 2015 UTC,"It really has been a frustrating thing to watch, and weirdly, worse in some districts than others.  I've a build in almost every district from plot restoration/renovation - the one in the Barrens hasn't been touched, but the one in Westshire has been messed up twice, one next to my actual house in Southshire had random holes dug in it.   Every one of these had blocks left in the chest that could've been used to repair the damage - it would've taken, on average, under a minute to fix. (One block of grass to hide the hole, for example!)  I've come to the conclusion that with some folk it's the same attitude that leads then to break windows in abandoned buildings, or throw litter on the ground instead of in a bin. They don't really care about whether they're making the area nasty for other people, they're just into destroying stuff and using ""role-playing as looters"" as an excuse."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dw49a,Alderdash,3,Mon Jul 20 09:56:42 2015 UTC,"Would it be possible to make it so that if a plot is abandoned in the same day its bought, it is rolled back to its original condition? It would solve the plot looting problem, and still let people leave nice things in chests."

LordsOfMinecraft,3dw49a,lysate,7,Mon Jul 20 02:49:45 2015 UTC,"I think, in this case, to say that this is 'their way' of playing the game is to mix up ways that the game can be played and ways the game should be played.  It's certainly possible to tear up every abandoned plot in the city for sick loots, but I think most would agree that it isn't acceptable behaviour for a server like Lords. It makes the city look ugly, and it wastes the gold, time, and creative work of other players. In fact, if there was an easy way to prevent without negative side effects, I'm sure it would have been done by now."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dw49a,Xricket,2,Mon Jul 20 03:15:00 2015 UTC,"well see, now you fall into the is–ought problem—how can you say how the game ought to be played? If you're allowed to spend your money on a plot and do whatever you want on it, I should be allowed to spend my money on that same plot when you're done with it and do the same.  that said, I'd be all for any kind of countermeasures that the Lords wish to put into place to prevent this kind of thing. But, as it stands right now, no wrongs are being committed."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dw49a,Sarkavonsy,13,Mon Jul 20 03:19:33 2015 UTC,"here is the thing though. Rob has been trying to encourage the community to make things look good. its  not just users that are wanting to beautify, its the lords as well. in fact, OMW even gave an insentive if every plot had a building on it or some kind of restoration by the end of summer. So while technically it may not be a written rule. it is going against what the community and the lords want.   besides some of this is just massive destruction. where one hole to get down would do. they are just making things look like crap."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dw49a,vK_InFaMy,3,Mon Jul 20 03:49:04 2015 UTC,"This might come across as sarcasm, so I want to make it clear that it's not - thank you for linking that! I've never heard of the Is-Ought Problem before! It was an interesting read and it made me think for a good while before concluding that you're right. One cannot deduce whether or not it's acceptable to tear up plots like this.  Outside the realm of formal logic, however, remains the fact that people don't like having plots they worked hard on getting wrecked for the sake of treasure hunting, and informally neither I, nor - and I hope it's not rude of me to presume this - much of the community want to deal with stuff they don't like.  Basically, of all the ways to arbitrarily transform ""what is"" into ""what ought to be,"" surely the desires of the server's community are the most sensible? Or at least more sensible than the alternative?  (I'm assuming that ""the community"" is fairly represented by the other comments on this post, which almost all express the sentiment that the desecration of plots for treasure hunting is a bad thing.)"
LordsOfMinecraft,3dw49a,McENEN,3,Mon Jul 20 04:32:37 2015 UTC,"Just because something is, doesn't mean it ought to not be different. One ought to not destroy plots, but one can. If one does, one ought to be banned, and often is.  Ethically, this kind of destruction is unquestionably wrong. Teleologically speaking, what are the results? The looter gets a small reward, sometimes nothing, rarely anything very valuable, while every other person loses a nice looking plot, part of the community or scenery, something that somebody spent time to build well. Clearly, the harm outweighs the pleasure. How about a  deontological  view? ""Not looting plots in a destructive manner"" would be a categorical imperative, since if everyone did so, the city would look like a war zone. Either way you slice it, this sort of behavior is wrong, and cannot be passed off as ""different strokes for different folks""."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dw49a,Peity,4,Mon Jul 20 12:08:12 2015 UTC,Most of them use hack clients such as x ray.  Plots have straight holes to a chest at the bottom of the plot.
LordsOfMinecraft,3dw49a,ImpsCorner,4,Mon Jul 20 06:45:50 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Even when there are doors to get to the chests, they dig through the floor. And don't fix the holes with the blocks they found in the chest they were digging to."

LordsOfMinecraft,3dwi0m,RoseTyler72,7,Mon Jul 20 02:55:19 2015 UTC,"Nothing is 'official' unless one of the Bwiznerds do it, but there are definitely lots of newspapers, and a handful of news services (the most well-known was the DNN, though it re-branded to a general entertainment network).  If you want a big, central newspaper sort of thing, go ahead and do it! It'd be really cool to have a leading publication kind of thing, and with how cheap unwritten books are and donation chests being a thing, you could definitely spread your paper around.  I never did anything like reporting, but back in the first couple months of the server I wrote a sort of 'Weekly Recap' and delivered copies around to the Guild Plots/places of interest, like a Sunday paper. It was definitely fun, and with the DNN no longer focusing on the news it'd be nice to see something similar crop up in its place."

LordsOfMinecraft,3drj38,Picherps,5,Sat Jul 18 20:43:33 2015 UTC,"I noticed that a while ago, among other things. Like, if you hover over the Submit buttons you get Lord Willy sliding in from the right. If you hover Coestar in the list of Lords you get his special Happy Birthday message and if you hover over Roamin, his symbol appears to his left. When looking at the districts, hovering over them provides you with a nice animation combined with a change to white font color, but if you hover over the Dwarven District it has a pinker tint not sure the reason for that, but it is there. And finally if you hover over  the buffalo wizard links, you get a spooky buffalo wizard slowly appearing."

LordsOfMinecraft,3dtejh,Paul_Blert32,5,Sun Jul 19 07:24:35 2015 UTC,"I think more schools/training academies/etc. would be pretty great. I mean, I know a lot of the people who come to Lords are younger and likely to be on summer break, so the last thing they'd want to do is go to a school. But, this is LoM we're talking about. There could be secret underground cabals where peasants go to master illegal magic, training academies for up-and-coming paladins. Heck, with the stuff we already have someone could make a culinary school where your 'diploma' is a trading card and *poof* you're a chef.   Another idea that works with what we already have now is a petting zoo. Just have a medium-sized or largish plot with a bunch of open air, themed pens for all the different types of animals (trading card or otherwise). Once it's built it wouldn't really have to be staffed or run by anyone specific; people could just come by and be animals for a bit, or gawk at the other people being animals. Maybe little Jimmy falls into a pit of wolverines and needs to be saved. Maybe you can take the scenic route back to your plot from the mines and feed the ducks. Lots of potential there, I think~"
LordsOfMinecraft,3dtejh,TornStar,2,Sun Jul 19 08:28:46 2015 UTC,We could build walls and check points so bandits cant get throw them without killing the guards or finding another way.
LordsOfMinecraft,3dtejh,redtps,2,Sun Jul 19 07:45:56 2015 UTC,That'd be pretty difficult to pull off since in the majority of the city there's always at least one block space between plots.  Neat idea though.
LordsOfMinecraft,3dtejh,TornStar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:10:53 2015 UTC,"I actually think someone did a thing similar to this over by the card shop, but I think it was more of a castle thing than a wall. The one block spaces make everything a bit difficult, though."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dtejh,TornStar,3,Sun Jul 19 08:24:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and getting plots 'combined' is a bit of a touchy thing. Probably less now than it was before BTP was revoked, but even though plots don't degrade it'd still be a pain if a plot gets abandoned and the new owner wants something different there and still won't be able to touch the bits between the plots."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dtejh,kookachild,2,Sun Jul 19 08:34:24 2015 UTC,"Plot wise I always like it when the builder has allowed something for people to do in the plot, even cooler when it is without lords help as it shows good knowledge on how to,do things inside of Lords Of Minecrafts peasant boundaries. This could be like a theme park or a dance hall, even a church used for people wanting to get married which is a big thing on Lords. Bandit and  paladin things could be like small outposts for people who have been hurt or people wanting to tell Paladins anything that happened to them so they can arrest the said person doing a crime. Or the bandit area could be like a hideout if you have done a crime, build something underground and don't make it obvious.... Or do.  I would find it better in my opinion if it was functional, I really like the hospital idea, I would just like to see more staff so that they can RP more easily. Functions like this are really cool to see."

LordsOfMinecraft,3dsai0,AStar_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:23:06 2015 UTC,I have a question about this. Is Netherward not a district? Because we kind of...never get invited to these kinda things. At least not to my knowledge...
LordsOfMinecraft,3dsai0,DerBrotkopf,4,Sun Jul 19 10:45:24 2015 UTC,"There was a post on this reddit calling for districts to organize their teams, and only 10 actually did. We only had a couple of days to set this up, so we needed to at least have expressed interest from the district in order to schedule them in the bracket. Sorry, but nobody from Netherward expressed interest; it would have been great if every district participated, but we couldn't wait for a response from everyone."

LordsOfMinecraft,3dsai0,Leontyy,2,Sun Jul 19 00:00:37 2015 UTC,"You know what leonty, none of this is your fault, you weren't there. We gave dwarven a rematch because we felt it was necessary. I'm not really sure Westshire deserves a rematch. You know they basically shit on what I've worked on and what Dar, THS, Anvil, vK, and DT have worked on for months? Perhaps that's not what they intended, but, I can't speak for the rest of my colleagues, they really made me feel shitty and inadequate for simply trying my best to entertain everyone."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dsai0,Peity,7,Sun Jul 19 00:03:36 2015 UTC,"As someone who has also put on a big event that took a heck of a lot more planning than people realize, thank you for hosting the game. I thought it was fun! Sorry some people decided to jump to assumptions of cheating. I heard those rumors too and told them quite simply Dunes put this together, but that doesn't mean they are cheating or that it is rigged. Be good sports; it's just a game anyway. So thanks! I thought you did well, and congrats to the team for winning!"
LordsOfMinecraft,3dsai0,McENEN,2,Sun Jul 19 01:41:28 2015 UTC,"the event is awsome, that a few guys are salty ehhh every time someone is well it cannot be avoided"
LordsOfMinecraft,3dsai0,Leontyy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:34:16 2015 UTC,I understand maybe you can give me a list we can speak and maybe we can do a rematch with a more respectful westshirians im really upset to hear this
LordsOfMinecraft,3dsai0,Leontyy,2,Sun Jul 19 00:08:04 2015 UTC,I'd be happy to talk about this with you leonty. But I'm just gonna make this clear once and once only: Westshire is not going to get a rematch. They removed themselves of the game; it was their decision. It was the final round of the final match and they had a clear chance to win. It was their choice to do so.
LordsOfMinecraft,3dsai0,Leontyy,2,Sun Jul 19 00:13:03 2015 UTC,Alright when you get online message me.
LordsOfMinecraft,3dsai0,Dimitri_Petrenko,2,Sun Jul 19 00:16:46 2015 UTC,"Another thing, after they left, I messaged Dimitri_pavlov saying ""Thanks for shitting on us"". I know that's not an appropriate thing to say, it was in the heat of the moment. But you know what he responded with? ""No problem, anytime"". That's just rude."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dsai0,Dimitri_Petrenko,2,Sun Jul 19 00:18:55 2015 UTC,Sigh And this is one of the reasons I may leave westshire to much drama....We should seriously make a parody of to many cooks but rename it to many drama > . >
LordsOfMinecraft,3dsai0,nmjk,3,Sun Jul 19 00:21:40 2015 UTC,i said that true thats no lie. I accept it. We up and left for a reason. I had to go soon anyway for irl I'm sorry your event got 'shit on'. But again alot of us think you guys did cheat. I personally don't care and hope to put this behind us before drama starts.
LordsOfMinecraft,3dsai0,Dimitri_Petrenko,7,Sun Jul 19 00:20:25 2015 UTC,before drama starts   Dude you literally started the drama
LordsOfMinecraft,3dsai0,McENEN,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:23:16 2015 UTC,"Your right to think that, but as i said down on my last reply. I will speak no more of this. I am avoiding this drama entirely and hope to put it past us. If not So be it."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dsai0,Dimitri_Petrenko,3,Sun Jul 19 00:51:49 2015 UTC,"One of your buddies sent me a screenshot of the TS with all of us, including the Barrens/Dunes team in it. For your information, we were only in the same channel when the B/D team wasn't playing. Next time before you assume something and insult someone, get your facts straightened up and think about your actions before you do it. You have no idea what repercussions your actions had on me and I'm sure the rest of the committee. It was a really shitty thing to do, and instead of insulting us all you had to do was say ""i've gotta go"" and give us an alternate person."

I'll add it to the list, thanks~"

LordsOfMinecraft,3dohpp,kookachild,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:06:00 2015 UTC,"The moova thing wasn't ever a video but Rob mentioned it as a distraction...

LordsOfMinecraft,3dohpp,kookachild,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:09:51 2015 UTC,It is almost as if Rob's main goal for Lords is to get peasants to be trapped inside a hole and die.

LordsOfMinecraft,3dohpp,Block_Parser,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:34:55 2015 UTC,I mean Rob slaughtered a small group of people who were only only on  a mission from nisovin... The massacre there. I mean what happened with the parade must have been even worse. Starting to shoot peasants because why not... He is insane...  Then again... Deadbones like you said is just as crazy if not more. He murdered innocent squires so he could pay off a debt or something...   That justin and nisovin though... Never see them start killing a load of peasants.

LordsOfMinecraft,3dovze,AndrewFr1234,10,Sat Jul 18 01:21:22 2015 UTC,"This is my take on this, while an event like this can be good RP, I find it kind of immature to declare war on any district without talking to the council first. I found it kind of funny and to be honest Fitz had it coming.  If you approached myself and the Barrens council before posting this and talked things over, it may have worked and we may have done it. There is a very high chance that because this did not happen, that all Barrens/Dunes residents will ignore it. While it does seem like this is part of your DD 'culture', don't try and force it onto other districts. We are trying to have a good time and relax, this impedes on that wish."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dovze,THStheThird,5,Sat Jul 18 01:55:06 2015 UTC,"I think you misunderstand the situation, we are saying that we want war and giving reasons why. This is purely RP so far, at least is meant to be. Like threats to the council of the sandy places. We haven't fully declared war yet either, tomorrow is the biggy where we decide everything (hopefully).   Also, in DD we have a massive anti-forced RP rule. If things were decided that war was definitely going to happen then we would talk to the council ooc but right now noting is official, so it's just idle threats and points."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dovze,Sir_Rodrik,6,Sat Jul 18 02:01:47 2015 UTC,"Alright, that's good to hear. Hopefully we can work something out."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dovze,THStheThird,2,Sat Jul 18 02:04:38 2015 UTC,Your right we rushed into it and just immediately said time for war.

LordsOfMinecraft,3dovze,Obsidious_D,8,Sat Jul 18 21:31:09 2015 UTC,"I'd like to point out that I (A_Beaver) had no part in this. In fact, I don't even live in the Dunes anymore. My friends in the Dunes did this, and I wasn't even online at the time. I do think that Fitz got what he deserved, though."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dovze,Makydog,4,Sat Jul 18 02:22:52 2015 UTC,Err.... I would recommend you guys just kinda forget this happened and don't do a war. Wars aren't good things to RP because they can very easily get taken too far.
LordsOfMinecraft,3dovze,Sir_Rodrik,2,Sat Jul 18 01:44:54 2015 UTC,If planned well with the enemy councils they can go well. Just kick out the bad crowd who only want to ruin peoples fun.
LordsOfMinecraft,3dovze,Makydog,2,Sat Jul 18 01:47:02 2015 UTC,"That's easier said than done. How would one even go about ""kicking out the bad crowd?"" Any person could do something in the name of supporting the war for their district, and the bad crowd could be a lot bigger than originally thought. At that point the war would more be about finding the bad crowd than actually fighting the war.  I see where you're coming from, I really do, but unless you go and plan out every skirmish, every battle, every rock thrown, even to the point of who wins each one, it isn't very feasible."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dovze,nmjk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:53:28 2015 UTC,"As long as it's intended for fun, and everyone involved is on-board with it playing out in a way that doesn't get out of hand, I can see there being value there. Like how the Barrens/Dunes once attempted a roleplay conflict -- it was all discussed OOC and agreed on before anything moved forward."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dovze,BlazeclawHD,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:52:58 2015 UTC,Yeah it's for fun rp. If stuff gets out of hand ooc just warn us.
LordsOfMinecraft,3dovze,Duffman295,7,Sat Jul 18 01:54:58 2015 UTC,"OOC: Whoa, everybody calm down. In RP, we haven't officially made any decision to go to war yet, we're going to have an emergency Council meeting to decide it. If the Dunes doesn't want to do this RP, we won't, but we would atleast like to find a RP solution to it.  Our RP perspective on it is, one of our contestants (doesn't matter who it was) was brutally assassinated infront of the whole city, a insult to the Dwarven District. So to continue this RP storyline, we will be discussing war for the time being.  Overall, we've decided to keep this all heavily in RP to avoid any drama, but if ooc, the dunes is against this, we'll RP out of it somehow."

LordsOfMinecraft,3dovze,Sir_Rodrik,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:47:28 2015 UTC,"well, it's still there currently."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dovze,lotloxa,3,Sat Jul 18 04:56:53 2015 UTC,"(my view just so it isnt a one view story to base your views on)  So, the district dispute with setting up well we were at the desk and we were getting some questions asked about our selves. During the start of this process an anvil plumetted from above and the questionner cheered, that was odd. And it was a crime against DD. They claim it was justice for fitz killing a beaver in a meeting, however fitz willingly offered a trial for justice and they did not respond, if they wanted justice this most certainly wasn't this. DD were slightly riled up now, but most wanted to continue on with the show. But then, we over heard a very bad whisper from the host to the barrans team ""i hope you beat them"". This proved it was going to be rigged, especially with the fact that it was their council who did the question forming. This caused people to leave. We had crimes committed against us and the show was going to be rigged, people wanted to destroy DDs pride infront of the whole kingdom, but we stayed strong, did not continue with the show as it'd give them the win when we actually tried and we left. Soon after we called a war council meeting, discussing what would happen, majority called for war. The horn of war has blown 2 times so far, upon the third sound of it true war will be declared.   To the people of the sandy parts, you done messed up.  To the other districts, pick your side, the ones who hunt for justice and honesty or the ones who seek for corrupt games and injustice.   -Rodrik Bolton"
LordsOfMinecraft,3dovze,Balbur,7,Sat Jul 18 01:46:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, he did offer himself for trial, but that was also after taunting the Grove rangers at their guild plot and stabbing Ozzie with a spear. Fitz has been incredibly antagonistic recently and has also made a threat to the Barrens about breaking all the district laws.   I don't believe you can claim innocence."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dovze,Sir_Rodrik,4,Sat Jul 18 02:15:15 2015 UTC,"""People of the sandy parts""  You mean, the ones that contacted the lords and organized this event in the first place?"
LordsOfMinecraft,3dovze,fitzdepl,3,Sat Jul 18 02:02:18 2015 UTC,"I call the people there that since whenever I call it the Barrans sand dunes get made and when the other way round Barrans get mad.

LordsOfMinecraft,3dovze,lotloxa,2,Sat Jul 18 02:52:54 2015 UTC,"(In-character) ""we know grove will help us"" Are you sure about that? The Dwarven Hammer's rushed to the Groves aid everytime they've been under threat of war, and the Dunes initiated this ""potential"" conflict."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dovze,McENEN,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:57:30 2015 UTC,"Sorry, Enen, I'ma have to agree with Duff on this point. From what I've seen the Barrens' council has been apathetic, at best, about helping the Grove during its times of need. However, considering Fitz, Dwarven District's Minister of Law, was the one who murdered A_Beaver, which ultimately lead to this incident, I doubt that the Grove would aid you in this conflict."

LordsOfMinecraft,3dovze,SilicaWhiteMane,2,Sat Jul 18 02:09:35 2015 UTC,The DD council has no authority to declare war.
LordsOfMinecraft,3dovze,Sir_Rodrik,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:03:33 2015 UTC,"I guess you didn't read the whole post or get both sides of the story? No war was declared, talked about yes, but not declared.  Technically No Councils, groups, or factions anywhere on the server have any authority to do anything whatsoever, its all in RP. If two groups on the server ""wanted"" to have conflict RP with eachother and all sides consented to it, then in that sense, they both have authority (in that specific RP situation) to declare war on eachother, but nobody's going to push it on a group that doesn't want it."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dovze,SilicaWhiteMane,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:59:52 2015 UTC,"I understand what you mean, but the DD council itself cannot declare war seeing as it has no power over its district.  I know what I am saying is sort of anti-rp but you cant really declare war and if you are you should try to gain Lord Willakers approval. Seeing that hes the only one with any real authority in your district."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dovze,firebolt8900,2,Sun Jul 19 14:38:48 2015 UTC,"(( only part i'm mad about is why  Dunes/Barrens killed fitz. It was your guy's fight to start with honestly. If grove killed him i would be even more neutral that i am. I think you did fuck up a bit on Dunes/Barrens killing him. As again, wasn't really your fight."
LordsOfMinecraft,3dovze,josh__ab,3,Mon Jul 20 16:42:56 2015 UTC,"I was not there, and have only heard DD's side and read the comments here. I'm going to say that this is not already started, mostly do to the fact that wars are scheduled to Wednesday. I think this is the warning, and the discussion of what the ""rules"" are and good etiquette for wars. DD has it down as we go to war with ourselves weekly, so if you guys need help let us know. As for forcing rp, we are also strongly against that, and will stop whatever we are doing if you OOC say you don't want to rp. But, if you decide that as a district you are going to ignore this, fine, we won't push it, but then you didn't kill fitz, and that is kinda an asshole move. Ok, so any questions?"
LordsOfMinecraft,3dovze,Ghureg,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:17:12 2015 UTC,Question! Why was this downvoted? It's relevant and there isn't really anything to disagree with to cause people to use the button wrongly. It seems like censorship to me.

LordsOfMinecraft,3doyvr,Duffman295,4,Sat Jul 18 03:05:04 2015 UTC,"We expected you guys to act with maturity, instead of waiting 10 minutes two more members of your team left over a small joke. We are not going to have a 5v2 District Dispute and we aren't going to waste more time, we asked the people who left to come back, but instead we were met with calls for war, which has no place in a celebration like this. We have a schedule and rules, you didn't have enough people so you forfeited. Sure it's not a Barrens win, but it sure is a Dwarven loss, you guys could have participated but chose not to. We simply expected you guys to participate like we originally agreed upon, you guys couldn't even do that :/"
LordsOfMinecraft,3doyvr,wanderingfalcon,5,Sat Jul 18 03:40:29 2015 UTC,"Here's our perspective. We were waiting a long time to for our first ever district dispute game, and there was a lot of chat spam at the place, so a lot of us decided to leave until our team was up. When the time finally came around, we all showed up excited and ready to cheer on our team. The next thing we know, somebody killed one of our people without warning...  I mean sure, that particular person ""may"" have had it coming, and sure, it was funny for most everybody else, but for us, it was rude and disrespectful, and made you guys no better than that person you were trying to get revenge on.  Had you guys ""thought"" to atleast tell one of us that ""hey, we're going to kill one of your guys on stage, so its going to be delayed 10 more minutes"" then we would have been ok with it, but you didn't, and just came off as jerks to most of us.  So we looked at it like this, ooc: it was an immature act of revenge and a dick move, in RP, it was an insult to us infront of everyone in the Kingdom. So we left with good reason."

I think during that entire time period I had one customer who actually visited, but it was a good hour and a half's worth of roleplay that had me rolling. After that, well, there's not a single noteworthy experience that hasn't been awesome, every part of this server has been spectacular. Sure there are frustrating hick ups at times, but man oh man, there is hilarity galore whenever I log on and wander around, vanished or unvanished :P"

LordsOfMinecraft,3dhub8,kookachild,3,Thu Jul 16 15:55:30 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I joined around when Rob announced double gold on PMC. Which is when the server was massive at the time and was when guudewillies was happening and everyone was happy. Oh those were the days. Now these days though! woah are they even better!   So I started with my little shack in the grove, really badly built but that never bothered me. I met so many people and it was really fun. However many times I used to sit at my home and do nothing. Back then as well there were many videos of the restaurants. I lived close to one of them and decided to make my own. Got about 6 customers in the end and made a massive loss but I never cared.  Since grove was my life back then and I still hold it very close to me, very close I met new people, most were gone now but meh, people like beaver duck jk I mean peregrinekt... Who I knew almost from the start. Sure I hardly ever talk to most of them now but still...  Back then I never really RP'd Until now that I am with [R] have I started doing things other than joking around and sitting at my home all day.  Wait are we doing favourite moment? Definitely managing to kill 4 grove ships and not get sunk... Sail of Marryn was the best ship confirmed. So yeah that was really fun. I also enjoyed many of the recent things with [R] turning into ducks at one point and then protecting Eh_Meth and then becomming wolves and terrorizing spawn. I also loved building the dragon no wait I meant puppy! Yes puppy, make  them believe that... Peasants are dumb right? That is why they are peasants kook... Oh really huh... That is why you are one of them kook... Aww...  Yeah sorry about that. I mean I have had so much fun with lords and it has been my favourite hobby throughout the year.  Thanks to Rob and nisovin for well doing pretty much every bit of code on Lords. And for creating this game and making it what it is. Oh yeah and thanks to Azur to for being well... Azur... Still needs to learn how to aim though... kappa.  Oh and spyd. Back then near Christmas. I remember donating 5 dollars per stream and doing donation wars with other fans :P That was fun  Any ways my massive wall of text is over now. Can't wait for the future and even more so with Lords 2.0"

Still the most satisfying thing I have done in minecraft ever. Would not now be possible with the jail because we died so many times trying to aggro it to get it to chase us up a ladder. Crushed when he disappeared when entities were cleared from spawn.     farming apples by having to stand in my basement for hours; you would only get about 1 per 20 saplings per 6 hours or so. Actually very rewarding and genuinely sad when saplings were removed because apples were one of the only things peasants could legitimately make themselves for roleplay selling. Parkouring around the PMC lobby the night of the move waiting for the new server to come up.  musical council chairs with Darkflux driving Jazai nuts while they were building the sewage plant very late night bad music plug.dj battles with Azmidiske and Vidokou while protesting the sewage plant.   finally getting sent to Jail by Lord Willakers after protesting the damn sewage plant continuously for 32 days.  And you think I afk in the pond at spawn for a long time ... hahahahahah Giving Roamin a parking ticket for the Tie Fighters telling peasants not to suggest that Nisovin was playing the floor is lava in the library and then having him actually play the floor is lava (I lived)  that time Spyd broke spawn and flooded the grove guild plot somehow.   that time the tree caught on fire when coe came to a grove meeting. Still no idea what that was about.   spending a month designing the grove/dwarven waterpark ride for the Coenniversary Plots with grove and dwarven people. Having azur come on my server to ok it because it used a crapload of signs and had water.  Then getting the plan somewhat sabotaged by the arrival of winter and draining of the lake (The original plan was to have the ride drop you into the lake at the end)   going to mt. Justmore to watch district dispute with Westshire and (whoever was up against Westshire)  building the ship Poose's Plunder and having it immediately sunk by the flood. Replacing it with the lazy river we always dreamed of.  Playing pirates for a month.  designing the first duck boat for the golden apple plot and having everyone in the grove flood build as many ducks as possible.  Sad there were not more duck jokes made; come on Justin, we made them for you! People in grove improved the design and made a resource pack so that the ducks now quack when you sit in them.  Grove vs. [r] Battleship and the Curse of Overlord.  Stealth Wapping Roamin whenever possible. Being a WishPlaty :)"
LordsOfMinecraft,3dhub8,noobster5000,2,Thu Jul 16 17:03:59 2015 UTC,Mine was when me and a few other grovians showed Lord Justin what wapping is.
LordsOfMinecraft,3dhub8,QueenMisread,2,Thu Jul 16 13:17:39 2015 UTC,"As far as memorable moments go, I've had several in the past seven months.  In the months before that, I was mostly oblivious (as in I didn't think a lot of people used it) to TS so I didn't really venture to it. I frequented the subreddits of course, and made my rounds on Lords. But that was about it. I've been part of the Lords community since the first night it was released. That was the night some of us toured the city and Rob told us about different districts and answered questions. I moved into Slums that night and watched Lord Willakers spawn zombies and place signs on plots. It was great. In the weeks and months following that I moved to Wizard's Tower, Netherward, and Paupers.  Around the very end of December is when I really started getting involved with the community. I had frequented the Handlebar for some weeks. Not really buying anything (because I was broke most of the time XD) but just hanging out and chatting with everyone. I did a review for them and in the review mentioned that if they ever needed help, I'd offer my services. Within minutes, Count had taken me up on that offer and I was part of the bar. I signed into TS for the first time that night and met a bunch of people over  the course of the days and haven't really looked back since then.  I met Bard_Core conveniently through a friendly Handle Off (Handlebar vs. Handlehut) and we pretty much hit it off that night. Funny because I had just gotten home from work that night and was going to go to bed, but decided to stop by SS TS first to see how the Handle Off was going. Got suckered into staying and hanging out with everyone in the room at the time. Bard had drank a Super Moonshine and was going to try to go the full five days with blindness, but ended up not going through with it. I gave him a Vineyard Purge, thus making me the first person he 'saw' when he was cured. I guess you could call it love at first sight?  Fast forward to a month later where I had already been talking to him almost non-stop. I'd already added him on Skype and we'd been talking as friends. A lot of our friends had already made some comments because they saw how we acted around each other. They were shipping us before we even started shipping us. They finally talked me into asking him out and oh god was that the hardest thing I had ever done. I still remember exactly how that went, but I won't bore anyone with the details. Just chalk it up to nervous Queen and Bard being all 'Um...I can't talk right now' when really he could. :P February 3 marks the day we officially became a couple.  I met him IRL for the first time at the beginning of June, and that went better than expected. I'd go as far to say that meet up has kind of made us even more inseparable. Even offline we still Skype and text. And I now have his good morning phone calls to look forward to which is pretty great. We're seriously talking about moving in together, and if all goes well, that should be happening in November.  My best female friend is also someone I have met via Handlebar, and someone I talk to almost on a daily basis. Basically I've met a lot of AMAZING people who I am proud to call friends. If it hadn't been for joining the Handlebar, I wouldn't have joined TS. I wouldn't have gotten to meet the people I've met, and I don't think I would be this active on Lords. Not going to lie, meeting this side of the community has made my life 100% better in the last seven months. I have a lot of friends and continue to meet some pretty amazing people."

LordsOfMinecraft,3ddrjf,Niblexis,12,Thu Jul 16 19:03:45 2015 UTC,"Seriously? More Ebola jokes? Not very original..., it's becoming the new ""Your Mom"" joke.     Plus, Ebola jokes are really xenophobic, because the ""joke"" is that people elsewhere are getting sick and dying from some strange illness."
LordsOfMinecraft,3ddrjf,_Han,7,Wed Jul 15 18:11:02 2015 UTC,It's not xenophobic to have this sort of joke.  A bit grim? Yes. But not xenophobic.
LordsOfMinecraft,3ddrjf,Niblexis,2,Wed Jul 15 22:53:44 2015 UTC,"Again. I'm not saying that this particular joke, a play-on-words, is xenophobic. I'm just saying that ebola jokes in general are.     The disease itself led to a bunch of paranoia. And you can see this with the fact that people assumed that, even though the disease was isolated to West Africa, people were panicking as if the entire continent was infected like it was World War Z.   People who traveled to Africa were told not to go back to work, even if they had been thousands of miles away from the outbreak. African immigrants were harrassed. Heck, some people I know are going on a visit to the opposite side of Africa this summer, and people were still seriously expressing concern that they needed to ""watch out for Ebola"". Even though the outbreak is winding down.      Africa is the world's 2nd largest continent, but in their heads, people just put ""Africans"" all together in one big group.     If 10k people had died in the United States of Ebola, rather than 10 thousand in Africa, nobody would be making Ebola jokes, especially when the outbreak is still going on."
LordsOfMinecraft,3ddrjf,TNT19000,4,Thu Jul 16 00:01:31 2015 UTC,"The jokes themselves aren't xenophobic, they're jokes on a disease that can affect anyone.   The people who are obviously not making jokes, but being serious about it, such as the harassment of immigrants you mentioned, would be xenophobic.  It's really silly to try and ruin people's fun by bringing in unnecessary social justice.   (I should add that people would make Ebola jokes even if it did occur in the U.S. instead)"

LordsOfMinecraft,3ddrjf,Reisyns,10,Wed Jul 15 18:17:40 2015 UTC,"It just bothers me, because all these Ebola jokes are, are jokes about Africans getting diseases.  It's a joke at the expense of people that are different."
LordsOfMinecraft,3ddrjf,_Han,8,Wed Jul 15 19:28:30 2015 UTC,I guess we should get on Rob's ass about WildFalcon's cancer cause its clearly not nice to mention a disease.  Let's just strike all diseases from mention.  We're not being insensitive to anyone or their plight. You're making an issue from nothing. Plsgo.
LordsOfMinecraft,3ddrjf,YukiGeorgia,10,Wed Jul 15 19:36:54 2015 UTC,"The difference is cancer's not a disease that only affects a specific demographic/continent.     There's a difference between making fun of the disease, and making fun of the people dying from it.  You've had your counter-argument, I've had mine. Let's leave it at that, this is rapidly approaching flame territory."
LordsOfMinecraft,3ddrjf,TNT19000,7,Wed Jul 15 19:40:35 2015 UTC,"Guy, first off nobody is joking about dying from it. Second off nobody is comparing this to a specific group of IRL humans.

I will however spare you the need to double post by answering your question. Stone hoe's are quite rare, and VERY desirable. I doubt you could get one for less than 10 diamonds.   If there were any for sale they would have been quickly snatched up by collectors who would gladly pay 10-15 diamonds+ for it, and since there are so few, they would almost never be sold by their owners. Many people feel sentimental value to their items, and a wand would most definitely have a lot of value in it, pushing owners to not sell.  I dont try to be pessimistic on these things, but on items this wanted and desirable, there is almost 0 chance to grab em, unless a real good personal friend of yours is up to giving it up. But dont feel glum, I, and everyone I know wants one too :)"

LordsOfMinecraft,3d66nq,Darnokthemage,10,Mon Jul 13 20:56:10 2015 UTC,"It would be cool to have some things outside the city walls for people to do, but I think it would go against the current storyline of ""King Poose is no longer King, but the peasants don't know because nobody is allowed to enter or leave the city""  Maybe for RP, the Lords could start getting us peasants organized and prepared for war against the ""traitors"", then we could have some outpost's outside the city walls for defence."
LordsOfMinecraft,3d66nq,Duffman295,6,Mon Jul 13 21:50:59 2015 UTC,Actually Rob convincing all the peasants that Camelot betrayed us sounds intriguing.

LordsOfMinecraft,3d3w21,LemonWoodTree,19,Mon Jul 13 08:57:46 2015 UTC,"Wow. Why don't I just publicly humiliate you because I don't like you build? Learn some god damn manners. I get you want the plot for community events, but announcing to everyone that you think the build is shit as well is just down right rude. Shame on you, seriously."
LordsOfMinecraft,3d3w21,Negnar_Holf,4,Mon Jul 13 17:04:34 2015 UTC,"In fairness, they never said it was 'shit' and weren't that rude about it, the concern was clearly stated that it doesn't look like a grove plot as it uses all bricks and red blocks, and it wasn't clear whether the owner intended on doing anything with it except holding the plot. But Zaf has commented on the thread and cleared things up so that's good enough for me."
LordsOfMinecraft,3d3w21,Kohtalon_,3,Mon Jul 13 18:45:40 2015 UTC,This has been happening since we got stone in the Grove. I've learned to ignore it.
LordsOfMinecraft,3d3w21,PwngoreStormfiend,4,Mon Jul 13 17:18:33 2015 UTC,"Good. There's seriously no reason for people to be so rude over this. If they're upset because you have a big plot, it's their own damn fault for not getting it first. That's how this server works. They have an entire guild plot designed for community usage, they don't need every single large plot in the district. Seriously disgraceful, and it backfired on them."
LordsOfMinecraft,3d3w21,Negnar_Holf,2,Mon Jul 13 17:20:30 2015 UTC,"Like Negnar said, good on you sticking to your guns when people have been hassling you.

LordsOfMinecraft,3d3w21,Makydog,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:08:07 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, I know the guy purposely trolls the Grove. He built that build right next to someone because he knew it would annoy them. The only reason I'm defending him here is because I don't want posts like this to be considered ok in the public eye. But nah, he's not even remotely innocent here."
LordsOfMinecraft,3d3w21,Negnar_Holf,7,Mon Jul 13 18:43:42 2015 UTC,"Actually I've had that plot since PMC, and when it was initially built the only people next to it were Lotloxa and Piplup, the building was initially never built to troll or piss people off, later on when we got stone I was adding it into a newer build and my neighbors had complained that stone was very ungrove etc. and had berated me for using so much, in defiance I used more.

LordsOfMinecraft,3d3w21,lotloxa,13,Tue Jul 14 00:06:29 2015 UTC,"I completely understand why your district would want one of the biggest plot for community events, but just because you want someone else's plot doesn't mean they have to give it to you. It's every person's right to be as little or as greatly active as they choose to be, and it's every person's right to do with their plot as they wish, as long as they aren't offending anybody.  I feel for your cause, I really do, but I don't think it's entirely justified."

I would not speak out about this if it wasn't 1. The largest plot in the district 2. Wanted by the leaders and active members of the Grove so they can hold events. If the idea of removing the person from the plot is not popular, I'll go away and leave him to continue keeping his stone box alive."
LordsOfMinecraft,3d3w21,lotloxa,7,Mon Jul 13 11:27:02 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason it's so hard to get to is because he had to renovate because of the flood and hasn't gotten around to changing it. I used to live next door to him actually, back then they were a happy couple of Apple farmers. He wanted to make his own sort of religion type thing, worshiping an Eldridich God of some sort. After the Brickton-Grove war, he started doing renovations, converting the orchard to more of a castle type thing. I stopped playing for a while, so I'm not sure what happened next, but I do know he's one of the founders of Cafe Latté, the maid cafe outside the airport portal. Most of them just have to grind their stam pots to keep up the rent and do very little on the server to begin with, unless someone decides to visit the cafe. It's likely that he could have just got burned out on minecraft and decided to take a break. I can't really say I approve of the big box, but honestly... It's still his, and I'm sure he must have some plan for it if he's still keeping it around."

I'm glad to see Zaferous is not MIA and has plans for it.   If anyone takes a look around that area it's evident we've put a lot of love into it to make the Grove a pretty place. I think this is what Lemon is concerned about, especially since she lives next door to where all of these changes are happening. I even built the plot she currently owns in SouthShire just to help that district along (and perhaps promote some Grovian love. ;D). Most people who see this plot usually ask us if anything is going to be done with it. We never have an answer except to simply tell them we haven't seen the owners around.   I truly hope everyone can relax, especially those offended. Again, this was not condoned by the Grove community and we didn't even know about it until I was alerted about the post myself."

LordsOfMinecraft,3d3w21,Kohtalon_,8,Thu Jul 16 11:31:09 2015 UTC,"Now I can understand wanting the plot, but this post is seriously not cool.   Some photos of this box, and how no effort was put into making it look like its from the Grove district:   Now, you may say that, but do you know the owner? Do you know whether or not this is a build that took time and effort, or are you just assuming based on your own building skills? Besides that, why does it have to look like it's part of the grove district? My plot (while built from wood and green glass) is covered in bricks from the brick bombing a while back, it doesn't look like a ""grove"" building, I mean it's covered in bricks. As the owner of the plot I love how it looks, my build stands out and is different. Should I be castrated and publicly humiliated because of this? No. Absolutely not. I don't see why you think that you have to build to fit in with your district, that seems silly to me.  Similarly, you don't have to be part of your district community. I just wanted to point that out since I did see you mention the plot owner not being heard from. District rp is by far not the only rp you can do, it's just one that's easier for newer players because it helps them get to know the people that will be immediately around them."
LordsOfMinecraft,3d3w21,firehotlavaball,4,Mon Jul 13 19:07:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know why people are so quick to jump to the conclusion that this is a personal attack or public humiliation rather than a genuine concern. Ok, maybe better suited to submit a ticket, but maybe they just wanted to see if they are still active (now confirmed) so there's no need for drama (also I don't really know either side personally so I don't know about existing drama).  Anyway to your point, they aren't saying no effort was put into the build or shaming them for being a bad builder, but no effort was made to look like Grove.   I don't see why you think that you have to build to fit in with your district, that seems silly to me.   Because the Lords said so. Same as using only wood in Brickton, only brick in Cloud, it's always been up to Lords' discretion, and Rob has had words with people when they do something particularly out of theme. (Your building is different because it is the result of a Lord's interaction)  Also there is such a thing as bad fellowship when people build something or hold a plot simply to spite others or the community in general."
LordsOfMinecraft,3d3w21,Kohtalon_,6,Mon Jul 13 19:44:03 2015 UTC,"The following were several descriptions given by the poster in regards to photos taken of the plot.   Oh wow! Lava! How creative…  Look, such a useful ladder!  WHAT THIS PLOT SHOULD LOOK LIKE (It does't have to, but they should at least put effort into it :( )   So, yes, they are in fact saying that no effort was put in the build. If this isn't shaming for being a bad builder, I don't know what is. In my eyes, the poster is being very rude towards whoever built this plot by calling them out publicly like this."
LordsOfMinecraft,3d3w21,Squibbi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:18:41 2015 UTC,"I mean, it was a pretty useless ladder XD. But seriously yes, could definitely be interpreted both ways and could probably have been done better. I would say that ideally it should have never been made public but the owner contacted directly, it just seemed that that wasn't possible in this case, but again the situation has been clarified by the owner so this is all moot now really."
LordsOfMinecraft,3d3w21,Kohtalon_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:54:20 2015 UTC,"Can I get a quote or video for the lords saying we have to build to fit in? I personally don't remember that being said, and was under the impression that the lords only really removed buildings that were offensive or trolling. Maybe I'm incorrect, I don't really have the best memory.  As for the personal attack/public humiliation bit, that's how the post came off to me. Especially since they did a walk-through of the plot, with commentary that sounded sarcastic and as though they were mocking the plot owner.  Fair enough, people can be spiteful, but from the comments the plot owner seems to be planning to use the plot and change it, and simply hasn't had time.  As for my own plot, I only mentioned it because I've had neighbours (who I believe have moved on by now) who complained my plot was ""un-grove-like"" and wanted me to ""fix"" it."
LordsOfMinecraft,3d3w21,Stephen_the_Walrus,6,Mon Jul 13 20:16:21 2015 UTC,"Here under plot etiquette it talks about Lord's leaving warnings and compliance, and later in zone block information it mentions themes. Rob has also mentioned it in several videos, but more as a side thought than the purpose of the video - the best example I can recall is this video where he talks about special plots that have access to all blocks still fitting in with the district.  And fair enough it's probably down to interpretation of the intent, I read it more as sarcastic humour than mockery, but either way no need to bring more drama especially if there already has been in the past so I'm not going to get any more involved.   For sure though, whether it's your plot or others, only the Lords have the right to say if someone should change their plot or not."
LordsOfMinecraft,3d3w21,_Han,3,Mon Jul 13 20:50:14 2015 UTC,"Firstly: This is a pretty rude way of going about this. As long as the person is logging on regularly to pay the rent, it's rightfully their plot. No matter how much you want it to be yours, it's theirs. No way around that. Next: No lord is going to help you with this, for the reasons stated above and below   One of the biggest plots in the Grove is being kept for no reason as people wait for the owner to one day stop coming on LoM.   Not everyone has enough free time to get on LoM and roleplay everyday, and just because they have a busy life doesn't give them any reason to abandon their plot   WHAT THIS PLOT SHOULD LOOK LIKE (It does't have to, but they should at least put effort into it :( )   Who are you to say what this person's plot should look like? They spent their time to get the gold for the blocks and build this plot, so as long as it's not offensive, they can build it any way they want to. Just because it doesn't look good to you doesn't mean they didn't put effort to it. There are some plots on LoM that I personally don't like, but that doesn't mean that they didn't put effort into it. And from what other Grove residents in this post are saying, it doesn't sound like it's really ""driving the grove crazy""  TL;DR: Don't say things about other people('s plot) that you wouldn't want other people to say about you(r plot)"
LordsOfMinecraft,3d3w21,PwngoreStormfiend,6,Tue Jul 14 03:14:49 2015 UTC,"To be fair, to quote Rob:   ...if you are done playing LoM, don't keep logging on to pay rent ... This server is more than just your ""sentimental"" value and if you're done with the server truely, then this value you have must not mean much.   I don't know if this person has essentially quit LoM or not, but it seems likely."

My guess is that the owner is saving the plot for future events or space to build. I personally don't think the lords would want to take down someone's building and plot just to give it to another group of people, it would be unfair to the owner of the plot. Although I would still prefer a big community of people to have the biggest plot in the district instead of one person having the whole place.

However it is expected that people still build in theme with the district, and clearly a giant stone box in the grove doesn't make sense.   I would say best/fairest option is for a Lord (probably Willakers) to leave a sign warning they have x amount of time to change the build to fit in or it will be demolished.

I'll try to get to it after I finish the MQ tutorial. I could probably make a video if you would be interested in that instead?"
LordsOfMinecraft,3cxdlr,Sir_Rodrik,10,Sat Jul 11 16:56:38 2015 UTC,The server didn't come up after the reset. There could be some Nisovin magic going on or it could just be a bad connection. Don't worry your little head though.
LordsOfMinecraft,3cxdlr,teddybeartyler,6,Sat Jul 11 17:10:13 2015 UTC,lords is rip in kil

LordsOfMinecraft,3cxdlr,Gamerboy77,4,Sun Jul 12 12:04:13 2015 UTC,"Most likely isn't the update. URL is today and it wouldn't be smart to release the update and have URL the same day. Plus, Rob would probably want to be around for the update reveal. Most likely just a crash."
LordsOfMinecraft,3cxdlr,teddybeartyler,2,Sat Jul 11 18:45:46 2015 UTC,Yeah i agree but theory crafting here theres always nisovin

Not to long after the server has a Maint happen and hasn't been back up since. Idk about the full update but could promise that some things are being implemented.  Either that or the server is legit just R.I.P for now and will be fixed soon lol"

LordsOfMinecraft,3cxdlr,redtps,2,Sat Jul 11 18:50:45 2015 UTC,I hope the server comes back online soon. Is it the server or connections problems??

LordsOfMinecraft,3cxdlr,Kobold_Number_4,2,Sat Jul 11 18:52:34 2015 UTC,It might have something to do with the fact that there is a URealms live right now.
LordsOfMinecraft,3cxdlr,Morselizer,2,Sat Jul 11 19:34:09 2015 UTC,"Is it just me or is this update taking way to long? I feel like this is the new magic update where you can have all sorts of cool things such like effects when you cast magic now i have no idea what there doing right now but it seems like they will be adding something new maybe even getting rid of those pesky LPD, i do know that soon swammies will put you in real jail when someone sees you they can report you. I hope this was useful to all of you guys wondering whats happening."
LordsOfMinecraft,3cxdlr,Morselizer,2,Sat Jul 11 20:40:47 2015 UTC,The server is back up! Nisovin restored it.

LordsOfMinecraft,3cx191,McENEN,2,Sat Jul 11 15:43:27 2015 UTC,I own the plot right next to yours and I think mine still opens up onto the highway. I was planning on remodeling soon anyways so maybe you and I could work out a little system to get from my entrance onto your plot?
LordsOfMinecraft,3cx191,_StarGazerX_,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:50:06 2015 UTC,That would be nice

LordsOfMinecraft,3cmfoa,Stephen_the_Walrus,11,Thu Jul 9 01:20:53 2015 UTC,"Aye, when people go to another district, they should respect that districts rules, if they do something illegal there, they shouldn't be surprised when that districts police/military forces come after them.  Edit: As Rob said, non of the district laws actually have any power, but it is nice to try and play along, more people have fun that way :)"
LordsOfMinecraft,3cmfoa,Duffman295,6,Thu Jul 9 01:54:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, district laws only apply from an RP point of view, but that sounds like they're giving an RP justification for their behavior. It would be different if they actually fled back into the Barrens (since the other district wouldn't have jurisdiction from the same RP point of view). But if they're caught by the applicable law enforcement agency (I don't know Mainstreet's) on land where they have jurisdiction, they cannot claim (in RP) that their home district protects them.

LordsOfMinecraft,3cmfoa,firebolt8900,22,Thu Jul 9 01:44:33 2015 UTC,District laws have no power on anyone so I mean anyone can ignore you laws if they want.  Do not force your way of playing on other players ever.
LordsOfMinecraft,3cmfoa,Rurikar,3,Thu Jul 9 06:24:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we personally always tell people they can opt out. But sometimes they want to roleplay with us and still use the ""defense"" the OP talks about.     Or other times they'll say they want to opt out, but will then spam chat with messages like, ""You'll never take me alive, coppers!!"" So it's never entirely clear."

LordsOfMinecraft,3cmfoa,iamtallerthanyou,4,Thu Jul 9 19:25:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but if people are going to participate in role play by doing some criminal act such as stealing for example, they should expect others to join the RP and potentially try to have them arrested. I'm all for respecting the RP of one another, but god modding ruins the fun. With the addition of the cards, people could just use one as a disguise and escape. It's not that hard to do. If people no longer wish to participate in the RP they can easily say so. No one can/will force them to continue."
LordsOfMinecraft,3cmfoa,Hades_Dude,3,Fri Jul 10 02:17:34 2015 UTC,"And if someone wants to RP as a thief that runs away from the law and is never caught, they can. You are the one god modding, you got it backwards man."
LordsOfMinecraft,3cmfoa,Rurikar,3,Fri Jul 10 03:35:06 2015 UTC,If they want to escape then they should make an escape. Not sit there and say that they can't be arrested because whatever they did isn't illegal where they are from. Both sides have an onus when it comes to functional role play.
LordsOfMinecraft,3cmfoa,Hades_Dude,2,Fri Jul 10 04:55:11 2015 UTC,"I feel yer in the right here. One sided RP is not fun group RP, which is what thieves who refuse to play along with the law do. Based on what Rob said, I would just /ignore those folks who don't operate like you do, and only interact with those who's RP meshes well with your own. That way, you're not hurting anyone's roleplay and you can't be accused of forcing anything on anyone."
LordsOfMinecraft,3cmfoa,Negnar_Holf,2,Fri Jul 10 06:30:11 2015 UTC,"No, you are completely in the wrong here. If they don't want to roleplay with you, you can't FORCE them too because of some law some other group of people made.  I am shocked you think this is okay. You are fully in the wrong here. You are the one god modding RP and I won't let districts have councils/government style RP at all if this continues to be a problem, because it's you causing the issues."
LordsOfMinecraft,3cmfoa,Rurikar,5,Fri Jul 10 05:59:06 2015 UTC,"Your right, but I feel you've misinterpreted what Hades was trying to get across (or I have). I think what he was trying to say is: If somebody goes somewhere like Cloud Kingdom, and starts roleplaying as a swammie dealer, then some LPD members show up and try to RP with the person, its a bit odd when the person playing the swammie dealer (while in-character mind you) say's ""you cops can't arrest me because I live in the Barrens where swammies are legal"".  I mean, if the person roleplaying as the swammie dealer just doesn't want to do jail RP, they could just say ""I don't want to RP with you guys"" in ooc:, or something like ""swammies? what swammies?"" if they want to stay in-character. Either way, nobody's really ""forcing"" anyone in this situation, its just a strange RP excuse to use when there are better alternatives :/"
LordsOfMinecraft,3cmfoa,Duffman295,2,Fri Jul 10 10:33:48 2015 UTC,"Did the lords give any police officers real power or authority? Then if they are selling swammies and you come up as a ""cop"" and arrest them and they aren't interested in that RP, you can't then get upset at what they are doing.  This is just making it more and more clear that you guys are not responsible enough to be allowed to have your own district councils, laws, officers, if you can't fundamentally get this. You have no authority to do anything and so if they don't want to rp with cops, they don't have too and they can IGNORE DISTRICT LAWS because those laws are only your RP your enforcing on others."
LordsOfMinecraft,3cmfoa,Rurikar,3,Fri Jul 10 19:13:00 2015 UTC,"The thing is though the people i'm talking about in that specific scenario ""are"" interested in that RP, the people who don't use a different response and never have any issues.  I agree with you, but I don't understand why you think people are being forced into RP they don't want. Any time I've witnessed this RP, everybody involved has been extremely responsible and reasonable with eachother, and worked things out in ooc: so everybody wins."
LordsOfMinecraft,3cmfoa,Duffman295,2,Fri Jul 10 19:47:16 2015 UTC,"Okay, we do realize that any of the Law Enforcement Agencies we have created do not hold any sort of power or authority. We know people can do whatever they want to. We do not want to force anything on anyone.   We're saying that if people do not wish to participate in police roleplay then they should roleplay out of the situation and just state in ooc that they do not want to participate and, maybe even tell the other person the direction they wish to take their own roleplay to avoid any further incidents."
LordsOfMinecraft,3cmfoa,Hades_Dude,2,Fri Jul 10 20:54:16 2015 UTC,"they should roleplay out of the situation   We'll, if they want out of the RP, its there choice how they do it. What i'm saying is, the people who ""do"" participate, aren't being forced, its by their own choice."

I'm saying that if the person does not wish to join us then they should manipulate the RP in a way that tricks the police force or whatever into ignoring them. They could even explain their reasoning in ooc if they wanted to.   I'm all for everyone getting along and having fun on here.
LordsOfMinecraft,3cmfoa,Hades_Dude,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:04:21 2015 UTC,"Like say I was in the Magic Quarter and I was using dark magic or something and the Arcane Guard tried to arrest me. I could explain in ooc where I wanted my RP to go and then say something along the lines of ""That wasn't me using magic! Although, I did see some strange wizard travel past the Guild earlier. He looked awfully suspicious... I think it would be best if you investigated."" They'd thank you for your tip and run off to investigate leaving you to your crime RP."
LordsOfMinecraft,3cmfoa,Hades_Dude,4,Fri Jul 10 11:11:54 2015 UTC,"One of the important parts of improv is learning how to not say ""no"". It doesn't mean that you cannot ever say the ""no"" word but it means that you shouldn't close other people's invitations to roleplay, even when you didn't expect them. It's hard time for the other guy to invite you to a cool unicorn chase when you immediately say ""unicorns don't exist"", while you could both go having fun chasing unicorns together.  This rule is often mentioned on LoM. But it is often mentioned without its original context. Improv is a discipline that's surprisingly quite scholar, and it has a bunch of rules tweaked around the idea that improv is meant to be played in competition or in improv shows. The ""don't say no"" rule is only really a rule in those conditions, where infringement upon those rules can often outcome in disqualifying one player if it's done too many times. In any other conditions, this rule is less a rule than a line of conduct to not close invitations to roleplay.   The thing is, we're on a Minecraft roleplay server, not in an improv competition or an improv show. An improv competition assumes that both players are in an improv show mindset and that other people will watch them, so they need to bring a quality show. This server is more a free ground for improv. Not every player is in the mood to roleplay at any time. Some can be busy going from a point A to a point B, some other can be just having fun parkouring or eating special foods. So you have to understand that when people say they don't have to comply to your laws, even if they say it in roleplay , most often that's because they don't feel like accepting your invitation to roleplay. Nothing personal, it's just that they planned on doing something else and they felt too polite to refuse in OOC. And most often people don't think this through entirely and come up with the first excuse that comes to their mind.  That's why even if people are technically bound to your district law, them saying that they are not just means that they don't feel like starting this roleplay right now. You had a pretty cool storyline to invite them into? Too bad for them, but understand that in the end they didn't agree to anything beforehand and you have no power into forcing your roleplay on them. You'll probably have better luck with someone else anyway, so don't insist, especially since that's because too many people tend to insist that the others try to avoid that kind of roleplay. And if you really think that you have a really cool storyline in mind that could bring fun to both of you, there's no shame going into OOC mode and explaining him that you feel like roleplaying and he should give it a chance. But yet, don't expect him to accept.  One of the other big rule in improv is that you mustn't be rude. By that I don't mean insulting people, I mean that you shouldn't impose something too restrictive to the other guy, because in the end that's restricting his ways to roleplay and that's basically the same thing as saying ""no"" to anything he could bring to you. Because you're not exempt to the rule, and you might not realize it but there are many way to say ""no"" without saying the word ""no"". By coming by, saying to the other player that he's breaking your rules, and that you have the power to arrest him, you're invading his personal space, and you're basically starting a roleplay invitation by shouting a big ""NO"" at his face. So don't be surprised if he answer with a ""no"".  Because the ""don't say no"" rule is not a rule on this server, just a line of conduct, and when you come by breaking this line right off the bat he has no reason to comply to it.  Because in the end roleplay is all about trust and when you start your roleplay by weakening your partener's trust, he has no reason to trust you for the everything else you'll bring."
LordsOfMinecraft,3cmfoa,istisp,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:59:59 2015 UTC,"This is actually a really interesting post, and probably worthy of its own thread and discussion.  There are so many things that can affect whether someone is interested in ""joining in"" on LoM.  Some people are genuinely not into the RP, maybe just want to build stuff and talk to friends a wee bit.  Sometimes you may have things to do (even if it's just sand factory/harvesting your carrots) and don't have the time to join in with someone else's story.  Sometimes you might just not be in the mood for those particular shenanigans and want to sit around in the market reading chat and eating popcorn. (Literally and metaphorically. :P)  I log into Lords sometimes to have some peaceful/less competitive Minecraft time, and those nights I just might not be up to travelling to the other side of the server to rescue someone where they accidentally locked themselves in a cellar. But, y'know, sometimes I am. So I don't mind being asked. :D"
LordsOfMinecraft,3cmfoa,Alderdash,2,Thu Jul 9 15:53:09 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, IMO that's something that people need to be at least aware of, so I definitely plan on posting something along those lines as its own post for discussion, but as a more general subject.  I already made a google doc of a first draft before writing this comment, but it was too unspecific for this thread so I rewrote it completely. I tend to get carried away when I argue about things."
LordsOfMinecraft,3cmfoa,istisp,3,Thu Jul 9 22:08:27 2015 UTC,"I would think this would be a ""no duh"" thing. It's like when you go to another country, you live by their rules, not your native ones."
LordsOfMinecraft,3cmfoa,icefirestorm,3,Thu Jul 9 02:56:35 2015 UTC,"Well, heres my explanation. District laws are ONLY active when your in the district. Even if you dont live in the barrens but if your in it you can steal deal swammies. I live in the barrens, my swammie operations are legal ONLY in the barrens. If I go to lets say the market   and start dealing swammies its ilegal. A lot of people do not understand this, they think that they live here makes them a legal swammie dealer, not the way it works."
LordsOfMinecraft,3cmfoa,McENEN,2,Thu Jul 9 08:42:56 2015 UTC,"I mean I don't see the problem doing something illegal, only people that could stop you are really Lords, it's not really breaking rp as long as your character would not obey the law."
LordsOfMinecraft,3cmfoa,Fudgywaffles,6,Thu Jul 9 04:14:28 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't doing something illegal, the problem is when people use ""I live in this district, so therefore you can't arrest me for doing this because it's legal in my district"" as an excuse not to get arrested. If someone brings marijuana from Colorado (where it's legal) to, say, South Dakota (where it's illegal) a cop isn't going to care where this person is from, drugs are illegal in South Dakota, so the guy gets arrested"
LordsOfMinecraft,3cmfoa,Fudgywaffles,2,Thu Jul 9 04:32:11 2015 UTC,"Bad comparison because Dong Dank is just one city, I mean the only time I experienced a council was my time in the grove, and at the time that I was in it, which was a while ago, the council members weren't really allowed to make decisions and there were no real rules, so I do not really understand how laws are created, but I see it as kind of weird to be making laws for each separate district. Also people arresting other people sounds like hard rp to do because of people having to work the part of a criminal that willingly gets captures, especially with things like Shardstones to get away whenever you want. Overall, I don't think people will ever truly listen to laws made by a district, as Rob has said before, council's are just for rp(, assuming councils are making the laws), not obeying the ""law"" doesn't always mean you are going to be arrested, unless these police are certified by Lords, which would probably mean they have ways to jail other peasants, which I doubt people have.  tldr: You really can't get ""arrested"" by anyone other than a lord, laws don't really exist except for the few given by lords, Dong Dank is a city, not a country."
LordsOfMinecraft,3cmfoa,Duffman295,3,Thu Jul 9 04:54:38 2015 UTC,"Councils are all for RP, but so is everything else. If somebody doesn't want to RP and just do whatever they want, nobody's going to try and stop them, but they'd just be alone in their own little world, But for people who want to RP with others, they have to be willing to accept of those peoples RP, otherwise its going to be one sided, and nobody is going to have fun. Its like when somebody god-RP's in combat, and makes it impossible for everybody else to win.  For the RP laws, the people in districts can play around with anything the Lords haven't stated as ""lords law"", for example, slavery: as far as I know no Lords have made any laws about it, so one district can say its legal for them, and another district can say its illegal. I think of the districts as like the Holds in Skyrim, where they all have the same basic laws, but then can make their own individual laws as well.  At the end of the day, it all comes down to whether the person wants to RP with others or not, if so, Awesome, each district has some unique laws and other things to spice things up, but if not, then ok, have fun with that :/"

But Rob can't just release the update like that. The server was pretty much sleeping for a few months due to lack of Lord interaction while waiting for summer and the update. So he needs to make the server alive again, and bring up the hype by releasing some videos first. The paladin vs bandit update is probably the biggest update since the mall, its release needs to be at least as grand.  Also he needs to explain the update both OOC and roleplay-wise. This server is a roleplay server, and this update has quite a lot of consequences on the city. One of the new feature will be the addition of magic, but he cannot just add magic like that, it would feel artificial. He's been hinting a lot of stuff of peasants slowly getting access to magic, now he needs to close the storyline.  So my guess is Rob needs to record and release some videos first.

Or if it's going to be a sort of server wide authority?"
LordsOfMinecraft,3ckyjr,Boopidoop1,9,Wed Jul 8 18:46:13 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you a bit about what I did and have done with my character, which might help you figure out what you want to do. Also, I recognise that others will have different advice and this is a little long.  The first thing I did was come up with a name. Now, I just used my MC username (Charliemadman) to create my character (Charlie Madman). Once I had done that, I started to think about what that name fitted.  With a name like what I had, it made sense to be human. It just seemed to fit. I couldn't imagine being an elf or an orc with that name.  Next came appearance. Again, being human, I decided that I wanted a human looking character. I thought about what age I wanted. The age I went for was around 40 to 60 (I never really pinned it down) as I wanted a character that had experience in life, had done some exciting things (travelled the world and what not), had a child and then settled down to run a bar. The age range just seemed to fit.  I looked over skins for Minecraft characters that seemed to fit my thought, and found around 4 or 5. I also thought about some of the backstory I wanted. I wanted my character to have been in some form of a lab setting, so I gave him a lab coat. I wanted my character to seem a little crazy, so I made him wear bunny slippers. I also wanted a bit of mystery to my character, so I gave him some weird looking goggles.  I mashed a few bits and pieces from a few skins, edited it to make it more unique, added a few bits and pieces, and came up with my character. I felt that my skin was important as, once I started playing the character, that is who I would be and look like unless I changed it.  Now, I had a name, backstory and appearance. Next came the actual integration into the server. I joined on Day One of the server, so I'd say it was actually harder to come up with roleplay stuff as it is now.  I picked the district I wanted to live in and set about creating my pub, The Fifth Wall. When I had finished, I waited, and people started to show up, like Torn and Tgoer. And that was it, I then got into roleplay. (I will say Torn asked me a lot of RP questions at the time, and the stuff I improvised to answer him became concrete. Sometimes it helps to sit down for 10 minutes and come up with backstory, at other times all it takes is one person asking you a question that you hadn't thought of and then improvising a response).  I would say, if you have a district in mind, check out their subreddit. See what they have a lot of, see what they have little of. Maybe even make a post saying that you're thinking of moving in, but you're not sure what roleplay stuff you could do and they'd be happy and able to tell you.  All in all, it's what you feel comfortable doing. And if you don't enjoy a character you've created, there's always (( or ooc: to say to people 'hey, I've changed character, I'm no longer a barman yeti, but instead a dwarf priest'.  Also, I feel you on the lack of D&D. I also grew up in sunny UK and never got into character creation based things like that.  Hope this helps in anyway. If it doesn't then... whoops :P"
LordsOfMinecraft,3ckyjr,charliemadman,2,Wed Jul 8 19:30:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that really helped :D  Same goes for everyone else, too tired to go through all of these :P  Now to plan a character... wish me luck :)"
LordsOfMinecraft,3ckyjr,Duffman295,3,Wed Jul 8 23:42:26 2015 UTC,Ever played Warcraft or any Elder Scrolls games? Maybe watched any Lord of the rings or Hobbit movies? Just pick any race you like and try to find a place you can RP as it :)
LordsOfMinecraft,3ckyjr,Negnar_Holf,3,Wed Jul 8 19:23:07 2015 UTC,"When you have your character made, stick to them regardless of what other people think. I play an arrogant, rich Dwarf who uses logic and greed as his driving force, rather than his feelings and compassion. Not everyone likes that roleplay, and will often strike out against me as being a bad person in general and what have you. People may not agree with what you choose to be, but don't let them force change upon you. It's about the experience, and having the chance to be someone other than yourself.  I cannot stress that enough - Roleplay is an experience, about being someone other than you. The best characters, I come to find, are the ones that are completely different from how you are in real life. Those characters force you to think differently, and to use your imagination to the fullest so you can really begin to understand the character. If you always play a kind, generous elf, perhaps you try a rude, greedy dwarf this time around. Get out of your comfort zone and you'll find it to be a lot more enjoyable than you first expected."
LordsOfMinecraft,3ckyjr,kookachild,2,Wed Jul 8 23:12:30 2015 UTC,"Oh man you have no idea about how the nerds are coming together in the UK XD I know there is like this internet cafe in Liverpool, gets around 40 people when it is open, nerds from everywhere dude, plus there is a Dungeons and Dragons set up last I went there :D.  I go to a school in which 80 percent of people there are massive nerds. In a school of about 200 people, not many people there but yeah.  What is good about the online world though is that most of the people you talk to will be nerds, at least in lords. This means that well you can have some funny stories. These things happen to me alot.  Here is something I do though, I sleep. Wow that is something crazy right? No I am joking, just dream about something awesome, some sort of t hing you love and make it your own story. When you are bored and alone, make up a story, I often do that when something happens, always minor, just making  things up in my head, great fun... I am sounding like such a weirdo ain't I...   I am sure that if you do this you soon will create some sort of story, about a character that you want it to be, doesn't have to be anything massive or small, just the person you like.  Or like you may have seen on the other comments, take things from games you like, try thinking of storys that would make sense there, then try and make one for lords, should be very easy for you.  All it is, is imagination. And boy is that fun.  I am telling ya I am not weird..."
LordsOfMinecraft,3ckyjr,lotloxa,2,Wed Jul 8 19:39:30 2015 UTC,"I think, while its easier to just be yourself and act as you would in the situation, it's more important that you do create a different character, with their own distinctive traits and quirks. It makes it easier to pull yourself out of the situation and prevent getting offended and potentially God rping.   As for making a character, I can't really say. Just do whatever you are comfortable with. Stay flexible, but make sure you stay consistent about your character. I don't tend to be a major character in any of the stories from friends, so it's quite funny, because no one has even asked me about my race, or age, or occupation, or anything of the sort. :P That allowed me to really think of what would make my character do this, versus needing to create a full backstory right from the beginning. Not nessecaily the most useful information, but you should remember that characters are not static. Most people are dynamic and can change their beliefs, morals, and judgement after an event. Change does not typically happen over night though.   A name is also important, and most people won't do traditional introductions of their names and such things, and would just give a nickname based off of your username. Which is kinda silly, but the only thing you can do is remind them it isn't your name. :P  Hope this helps,  and welcome to the city!"

LordsOfMinecraft,3ckyjr,purpleholsterz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:37:55 2015 UTC,"It's really not that hard, you can't make a mistake as everything on the server is weird. Think of one or two things that set you apart, play that out, and see what happens. You can always change things up. I for example, started as a normal duck. I then became a detective duck after about a month. Once you find something that works, sick with it. There's no problem with comepletly changing your character.  EDIT: if you are good at it, try making your own skin. It is fun, and sets your character apart from just using the typical teenager or creeper in a suit skin"

Then I picked my race. As there are no humans, only tall dwarves who shaved there beards, that's what I decided to be.  Then you pick your personality. I made myself into a poor dwarf who was sent by my mother to Dong Dank for a better life and to become richer and more powerful. I have a bit of combat experience and more brewing and potion maker experience. As a dwarf, I don't want to be too old, so I'm about the mid thirtys equivalent of dwarves, about 200 ish. I use my fathers death as something that drives my character to be on top.   As someone else with no DD experience, I also find it hard to role play sometimes. But even though I'm not the best role play er, I'm having tons of fun doing it here."

We don't really need a dedicated postal service; you can just go to your friend's plot and leave a letter directly.  I mean, if you want to make a postal service just for peasants, more power to ya! There is the Plot Map nisovin made, but I don't think it's searchable so it'll still be awfully hard to track down the plots of people you don't know.  Also, don't worry too much about 'copying' someone's idea. You can do the same thing someone else does, an' hey, if someone else is already doing it y'all could work together, or be rivals!

How are you managing to have such a problem with it?!  I know it's harder for folk who don't have access to dirt/grass, but if you actually live in Westshire it's pretty simple to have a few blocks of carrots growing somewhere, and just renew them now and again. And you can often get carrots for pennies at the marketplace."
LordsOfMinecraft,3cfejn,Alderdash,4,Tue Jul 7 14:27:19 2015 UTC,"It would be cool if the hunger bar went so that we didn't have to worry about regeneration or hunger.   At the same time, with the current situation, you do need to eat to keep that hunger bar all the way up to regenerate health.  You can just say that there are limitations for using the warp systems. Maybe, through teleportation, it hurts to have your body parts separated and reglued together elsewhere. I dunno, I'm not the RPied RPiper, creator of RP."
LordsOfMinecraft,3cfejn,charliemadman,3,Tue Jul 7 14:33:14 2015 UTC,It was actually like that back in the PMC days. I believe this was changed to give restaurants a bit more of a purpose.

LordsOfMinecraft,3cfejn,wanderingfalcon,2,Tue Jul 7 15:31:55 2015 UTC,well if food didnt go down almost NO ONE would ever want to go to eat at a restraunt unless they have nothing else to do. Although the no hunger bar dropping does have positives
LordsOfMinecraft,3cfejn,Jalbot,2,Tue Jul 7 17:57:23 2015 UTC,Food was meant for RP.
LordsOfMinecraft,3cfejn,Nicci_Galanohel,2,Tue Jul 7 18:27:43 2015 UTC,"The only time I ever eat at a restaurant is when I want to RP (which happens a lot).   There is no reason to not just eat carrots when trying to stay full. They stack, and are a fraction of the price."
LordsOfMinecraft,3cfejn,Jalbot,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:51:24 2015 UTC,"not saying that i dont think you shouldnt just buy carrots, and not saying that 100% people would just not go to restraunts, but restraunt owners would probably just quit except for the people who like the rp aspect!"
LordsOfMinecraft,3cfejn,Nicci_Galanohel,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:36:53 2015 UTC,"Rob said that the restaurants were never intended to be a gold making endeavor; they are for rp.  I wasn't aware that anyone actually used the special food for the hunger aspect of it. I know I never have. I have always just used it for roleplay and the effects. That appeal would still be there, and thus, resturants would still be getting business."
LordsOfMinecraft,3cfejn,Jalbot,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:29:50 2015 UTC,"yea but how many people would go to there shop a day? Eventually it would be boring just waiting for someone to pop by. i guess i didnt make myself clear. (no offense) Anyway.... just a question, didnt rob get rid of carrots to make people kinda have to go to restraunts? (as well as the carrot bombings in chests)"
LordsOfMinecraft,3cfejn,Nicci_Galanohel,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:43:03 2015 UTC,"From what I have seen, people leave signs telling customers to message them for service. Almost no one just sits around all day waiting for buyers. It is nice to have the option to RP buy stuff at local businesses; but, as I have said, people buy food for either the RP aspect, or the effects from the special items. They don't generally buy the food because they actually need to eat. That wouldn't change if the hunger thing went away.   Honestly, I do have to agree that complaining about it is silly, though. It's not that hard to carry around a stack of carrots with you for when you start getting hungry. My biggest issue with taking the damage has to do with wearing armor. It's annoying to have to take if off is you are going to warp if you don't want to damage it. Not that big a deal, though."
LordsOfMinecraft,3cfejn,Jalbot,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:50:55 2015 UTC,man i am the odd one then my favorite thing to do is buy a gb worth of food and just hork it down and see the shopkeepers reactions!

You're complaining -no, screaming- that your instant, free, rechargeable transport mechanisms are killing you. They are killing you because you are not eating. Why are you not eating? Food is far from difficult to obtain. It is virtually unlimited, dude. And literally no one is forcing you to use your homestone and the warp pipes. LITERALLY no one. The city is not that large, you can walk or use the portal system that existed FAR before the warp pipes and the stones.  So take a step back and calm down. You're only embarrassing yourself."

I agree that the VY has gone astray from LOM and have begun playing other games. Because of this I have spent more time in other districts and growing closer to those LOM communities. Recently, under the leadership of devito a group of us have started to try and get the VY back on track. 2 events have been organized and plans to help build and improve the VY LOM commmunity are in the works. Other memember of the community are working their hardest to see that that happens. Those people that spoke out against LOM have left to form their own community. Enough of me rambling, I love this server and I love my districts and my friends I have made on LOM.  So i ask of you to give VY a second chance and prove to you that we can get back on track and turn into a Lom district again.there are others who live and play in the Vineyard district who are innocent in all this."

I think they were all really cool people, but the fact was that around the time I started falling out with them, sometime around October or November, they had already started to spend less and less time in LoM, and much more time playing other games, and a lot of the times while I was in the teamspeak I felt so very out of touch with them, and during that time I was hanging out a lot with Mainstreet at the start of their teamspeak and South Shire.   Eventually after a lot of things that happened, I ended up moving into the Grove instead with a few close friends I made there. I was able to be a big part in the Grove and help out with so many things and feel like I was part of a community again. I just didn't feel close at all anymore to Vineyard, and I ended up just falling out with the whole teamspeak, I didn't feel like I could really talk to anyone since they would always be playing other game and never really on lords. It really saddens me that this had to happen, but I understand why.    I hope that you guys are able to bounce back despite of all this Drama. I know you guys can. I know I'm no longer vineyard but you guys were my first family. I wish you all the best <3"
LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,Tripleat,2,Mon Jul 6 10:17:00 2015 UTC,"Even though I agree with your general ideals, the Vineyard has to put these things behind themselves. I personally would favor having a new subreddit for the Vineyard as the current subreddit is controlled from a meta level by people who aren't a major part of the Vineyard on LoM. When we clean up the drama, then we can negotiate for a second chance."
LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,CastleCubed,5,Sun Jul 5 23:38:27 2015 UTC,"I would just like to say, our mods do play and care for the LoM community. As for the frequenters of it, I will not deny the fact that a very very large majority do not. And while this whole situation (as a whole, not just this particular happenstance) really really saddens me, I understand the actions that were taken."
LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,NikiCy4,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:48:16 2015 UTC,"I understand, it't unfortunate to have to come to this, but when I wrote active, I meant something like devito active, not general activity, but I guess I should make these things more clear for the future."
LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,CastleCubed,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:57:40 2015 UTC,"Sal and Niki are plenty active enough to run the Subreddit.

LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,CastleCubed,3,Mon Jul 6 00:55:49 2015 UTC,"A new subreddit is being made. Also the current subreddit is not actually controlled by people who do not play LoM. It is run by Sal, Niki, and Cheap. Cheap doesn't do much on the Reddit anymore, but is active on LoM. Both Niki and Sal are active on LoM. Both have actual jobs in real life so they aren't as active as people who are off for summer break, but they are active."

LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,CastleCubed,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:54:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not making it. I have nothing to do with that community anymore, I was just trying to let you know about the current mods on the reddit."
LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,SystemOctave,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:59:14 2015 UTC,"And yeah, I guess I really didn't get the point you were making. The way you worded it made it seem like I responded to it correctly.   Can you elaborate?"
LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,SystemOctave,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:55:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, it's cool with me."
LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,CastleCubed,10,Mon Jul 6 01:12:27 2015 UTC,"Well said. The communities we have created all originated from Lords and it's best to remember that. In the Dunes, while we may now not be solely a community on Lords, we know that it is the centre of the wheel while the other games we play are merely spokes. The only way to get new people into our communities is through Lords, without it, members would slowly fizzle away and all our Teamspeaks would become empty. Sure, play other games with your communities, but stay active in LoM, organise events, engage in RP. LoM is to us, what SMP was to Mindcrack. Don't let us suffer the same fate."
LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,Darbooma,9,Sun Jul 5 22:26:05 2015 UTC,"I don't even know where to start with all that happened, which is probably why I'm writing this so late.  Being friends and close to both parties, I got kind of stuck in the middle. When it comes down to it though, I would have to say we have no one to blame but ourselves. What should have been a discussion in a TS or just through messages, had to turn into a reddit shit-storm.   After this year of being on Lords, if there's one thing I've learned, Drama can and will start anywhere, the only thing you can do is minimize those that get hurt. We handled this poorly among ourselves and really needed a wake-up call. Thank you for this, and waiting until after the Winery event to give us it."

LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,AndrewFr1234,5,Sun Jul 5 22:22:31 2015 UTC,"If that's what people want to do, they can make their own council.  At the end of the day the council has no real power, it's more centered around role play, no matter how many councils there are. Hell, don't you guys have two already?"

LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,Jalbot,2,Mon Jul 6 14:50:03 2015 UTC,We already have that and it kinda sucks
LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,AndrewFr1234,2,Mon Jul 6 16:31:28 2015 UTC,"I knew this was going to happen sometime with a sub-reddit, but damm it still sucks that this happened."
LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,josh__ab,2,Sun Jul 5 23:20:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's pretty sad, but that's why subreddits need good moderation to delete negative threads before everyone reads it.  I'm all for freedom of speech on my sub, but you can only go so far until drama starts."
LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,Juliandroid98,2,Mon Jul 6 09:56:15 2015 UTC,I severely apologize that you don't think we are running our subreddit according to your ideals. We do not want to censor everyone into the ground so we let people share their opinions. The only problem with this was that people's opinions for what they thought was best for the vineyard turned out to be conflicting.
LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,NikiCy4,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:25:32 2015 UTC,"I understand that conflitcs can happen.  But if that does happen again in the future, simply delete the comments or the whole thread in that matter. It'll prevent drama like this."
LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,Juliandroid98,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:54:30 2015 UTC,"But it was important that things get talked out. We knew that people had been feeling this way for a long time and even though a lot of stuff happened, I feel as though it needed to happen and we will all move on better and stronger now."
LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,NikiCy4,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:31:45 2015 UTC,"You're right, but Reddit is a bit too open for everyone to start something like that.  If it was in a more enclosed area like teamspeak, this drama on reddit didn't happen.  It's really just a learning point. And again, conflicts can happen, there is no way to avoid that. And sometimes it leads to realization and good things."
LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,Juliandroid98,3,Mon Jul 6 17:33:45 2015 UTC,"I can tell you from experience that the act of deleting controversial threads can itself be considered controversial and cause even more drama. Even deleting posts which are made by anonymous throwaways with the obvious intended purpose of causing drama, somehow causes more drama under the guise of ""CENSORSHIP! OMGWTF!!!1!"".  In the end, we can all hope that people will learn from these experiences and grow in maturity and their ability to resolve differences; and also recognize that in some cases its not actually possible to resolve differences and it's better for groups to go their separate ways."
LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,wanderingfalcon,4,Mon Jul 6 17:47:15 2015 UTC,"Well, this is kind of sad to me for a couple of reasons...  First, this is the first time I've noticed any silly cliquey drama on LoM - I suppose it was inevitable that something would happen eventually, and I assume there's been minor stuff that hasn't been so public, but just...aw... Makes me sad.   Second, I spent some time a the Winery event this evening and had a lovely time. Granted, I spent most of it queuing for drinks (hic) but I'm a Brit, and queuing is our other national sport, so it was great! What a shame to have this stuff leaving a nasty taste for everyone involved.  I hope the community in the Vineyard are able to pull themselves back together and recover from this setback, because you can be sure that there are random innocent folk who are less involved and know nothing about this. (I'd be oblivious to any drama in Southshire despite living there since my first day on Lords, I chose to live there because it was close to spawn and had lots of blue blocks, not for the politics!)"
LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,Alderdash,3,Mon Jul 6 00:32:33 2015 UTC,"Well, rest in peace Vineyard. You were my first district and I will never forget you :("
LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,Lovelandmonkey,3,Sun Jul 5 22:30:24 2015 UTC,"Heh, well damn. It's good for everyone to get a slap of reality every once in a while. Nobody should ever lose sight of where they're really standing."

LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,Kobold_Number_4,2,Mon Jul 6 00:07:46 2015 UTC,I think (Idk for sure) that's why we stopped having councils in Mainstreet because it created to much drama. We just have community meetings without councils instead.
LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,justdefi,2,Mon Jul 6 14:19:59 2015 UTC,And people questioned me building a cannon and pointing it at Vineyard.
LordsOfMinecraft,3c8jka,Lucimon,2,Mon Jul 6 16:31:45 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with what those people are doing in any way shape or form, and hope they never come back. Equally, I hope they find a community where they are happier and don't feel the urge to shit all over everyone.   Now, I'm not sure if you are aware of what is currently happening in DD, or even care for that matter, but it's certainly interesting. The Outsider would be proud. In LOM, we have no idea whats happening to our district. Some want to split the top half of DD into its own sub district, like westshire, because there are two groups of people in DD that have different ideas of what fun rp is and what we want to district to be like. There is also a group, mostly made up of the council and a few others, that think DD should stay whole, as it will split the community. This is what is currently going on in lords, but DD has grown past lords. We're at the point where we have two of our own servers that we frequent, we all play different games together, and overall are a loving community. We let people into our community if they make an effort to get in, because we really don't need a hundred jimmies that are only on for council meetings. We have a community where I feel safe to share how I feel in the real world, some of them are better friends to me then I have irl. It pains me to read things like this where communities are suffering because a few dickbags think they own everything, because they don't. But at the same time, we need to recognise these people for everything good they've done, because without people like Peity for instance, DD wouldn't be a community. These people have done a lot for us, and do deserve some form of recognition. But when they shut down communities because they don't get it, it goes to far. As a general rule, sense a lot of people here really take these communities seriously (I included), don't do anything you wouldn't do to your friends in real life."

As at my school irl there is lots of drama and i try to do my best to stop it try to keep people happy. Thanks rob for this cause it could help lots of people  be less drama and more peaceful. As your new updates coming out will make rp more action like and medival and epic will be fun.

LordsOfMinecraft,3btb4o,Duffman295,3,Wed Jul 1 23:44:07 2015 UTC,"Well personally I live in the castle so you'd assume that the lords would be there to protect the King and Queen so i'd probably stay in the castle with some other peasants under lord protection. Even if the lords are not at the castle (maybe they go to friendship town or some place) it is still very easy to defend due to the fact that it has 1 main way in and has many floors up and down.  The castle itself is in a very good spot on the map as well since it is the center of Dong Dank as well as access to the main-street and a portal. The most similar thing to the castle i'd have to say is the mountain , sure it does not have plots inside but if you just want to survive i'd say the mountain is one of the best places to go since it is quite open and has multiple floors.  Also just because i'm curious would this event be similar to a purge? as in would peasants also be able to access any doors  , trapdoors , levers etc. Also this one is kind of difficult to decide but maybe all chests were unlocked too , because well if it is a sort of purge/apocalypse you are not going to go into someone's house and not loot it for supplies.  But yea that's just my opinion on what i'd do if something similar to this happened I really liked the idea of this and I hope this thread gets more replies :D"
LordsOfMinecraft,3btb4o,Kavlo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:21:55 2015 UTC,"Hmm, i'm going to say that people can use levers and such, but not chest's unless they convince the owner to employ them on the plot."
LordsOfMinecraft,3btb4o,Natnif19,2,Thu Jul 2 00:25:49 2015 UTC,The server could get backed up before hand so after this 'event' happened it would carry on as normal. An alternate timeline! This way anything looted from chests wouldn't be looted... if that makes sense.
LordsOfMinecraft,3btb4o,Sir_Rodrik,4,Thu Jul 2 07:39:11 2015 UTC,"Well obviously DD would obliterate our portal in an instant and then just leave the rest of the districts to burn. After their governments have been toppled we roll in district by district slaughtering the creatures and destroying the portals, and leaving one person there to lead the district for us. And then once the problem has been solved we promise to give the districts a council again so we annex them all and make our council have ruling over them thus completing the DD imperialist movement."
LordsOfMinecraft,3btb4o,lotloxa,2,Wed Jul 1 23:51:36 2015 UTC,"This sounds like a more out of character thing than a RP thingy, since I can't imagine saying in chat, ""* shoots a fireball *"", would do anything to the mobs. :P   So, in that case, what I'd do is probably buy a buttload of cactuses and just start creating a bunch of field hazards through the Barrens as I slowly gather a large portions of mobs, before taking a turning to the lake, since you can out swim mobs, and just going in a straight line from one far end to the other.   Honesty, I think the Barrens would be kinda screwed in this hypothetical scenario. :P   Another good location might be at the top of the Great Oak, since there's this gap you would need to cross with jump pads. Even if they understood how it works, you can easily knock them back down after they land."
LordsOfMinecraft,3btb4o,vector_nova,2,Thu Jul 2 05:42:00 2015 UTC,"This is why we need a standing army in dong dank because, if this ever happen security forces might gives some resistance, but couldn't defeat a enemy such as this, but dong dank doesn't have a standing army so, I would go around and round up as many people who are willing to fight, and destroy the gates one by one. I would rather fight and die before, I see my city burn. Also I want to steal molag bal's mace."

Once that's done, either get people to their homes to start barricading them, since we can use the cave systems easily to get around, or if not enough of Dwarven is around to get all the plots blocked off (Since it's not likely everyone could be on) get everyone to the mountain, at least temporarily, trying to get everyone organized.   We'd either stay in the mountain, or go to the castle where its probably one of the safest places if the lords are there.  Another suggestion, depending on the mob capabilities would be to hole ourselves up in the jail. It's surrounded by water, and seems pretty secure, so unless mobs were able to be jailed/able to figure out a way into the jail (Aka, do you think the jail would be safe from mobs? Or would there be a way for them to get in?) it would be one of the safest places, especially with the many levels, even if mobs could get there, we could move a few levels up and have a choke point to start getting rid of them. Plus, depending on if we made it into the jail without jail time, or with, we could have a way to have a few people continually protect spawn from mobs, and if they die, they'll just end up back in jail again."

Otherwise, you could go to the LoMMarket Subreddit! to buy a pair. Prices may vary based on seller. You use your crouch button (for most people, its shift. For me, its control). As you eat swammies, you will see that you have x pounds of Swammie Essence. Each jump with the White Air Justins (the blue ones don't actually have the jump function) will cost you around 3 Swammie Essence. As you have more pounds of Swammie Essence, you can jump higher (and it will cost more Essence to jump). So for me, at around 200 pounds, I can jump to the second level of the bank ezpz.    Hope this helps."

Some people build in a region based on its color palette, others based on the district community, still others based on proximity to a fun or useful location. And I guess some choose based on price though with a few exceptions such as the mall, wizard tower, or cloud district, most plots are very cheap!"

LordsOfMinecraft,3bk5je,hailthechief1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:33:29 2015 UTC,no we auction of there items they get all the profits and if you want to donate to the auction house 75% of that goes to th vy community fund

LordsOfMinecraft,3bk5je,teddybeartyler,2,Tue Jun 30 23:31:17 2015 UTC,To pay the rent and to pay for events i want to host in the future
LordsOfMinecraft,3bk5je,bullseye2230,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:56:01 2015 UTC,so in that definition it isn't a non-profit then... A non-profit gives 100% of all earned money to a charity and runs operations based off donations.
LordsOfMinecraft,3bk5je,Lovelandmonkey,2,Wed Jul 1 02:55:45 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, all nonprofits have to pay operating costs, generally sorted into program expenses, administrative expenses, and fundraising expenses. here's a pretty neat website that helps you get more information on charities, especially on how they use dontations (linkeed to american red cross, since its quite well known): http://tinyurl.com/p72u3s2  now, how this translates into LOM donations, thats kinda iffy. Some peasants have plenty of money, and can easily fund events and such out of pocket with no worry. Others do not have this, and aren't good friends with anyone they can get to fund such events. I can see a perfectly valid desire to spend a portion of donations towards administrative costs (paying oneself), and I personally don't mind that as long as its not most of the donations. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion on the matter, just thought I'd put this out here, because its a fairly common misconception (at least around where i live) that charities do in fact either give 99% to the cause and pay their expenses some other way, or they keep it all for themselves and are a fake charity. people don't realize that running a huge charity is like running a huge business, and costs quite a pretty penny."
LordsOfMinecraft,3bk5je,Lovelandmonkey,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:53:33 2015 UTC,Yes and no i consider it non profit cause any money we earn is through donations and the rest of the money thats not going to the vy community fund is going to support future projects i my self plan on hosting and keeping this project running

I (a Dwarven Keystone) was there to represent the DH, but had no hand in running the meeting, and I was just as much in the dark as any other district Reps there.  Tbh though, I'm surprised how well the meeting went for the most part. I half expected Fitz was going to come in with a bunch of mercenary's at his side, and try to kill/capture all the leaders of Dong Danks Military and police forces in an attempt to take over the city, but that didn't happen, so i'd consider the meeting mostly a success! :D"

LordsOfMinecraft,3bctgd,Dimitri_Petrenko,6,Sun Jun 28 03:52:22 2015 UTC,I agree with this statement. Not everyone wants to rp conflict.

But i know not everyone wishes to rp fight/conflict but i find thats a realllllly big part of rp anymore sadly. So cancelling/refusing it i don't think is cool/nice or a wise thing. just my opinion
LordsOfMinecraft,3bctgd,Double_Dash123,3,Mon Jul 6 00:00:00 2015 UTC,"You should have asked for permission, ooc, if you wanted to do something like that. As far as the grove knew, we were invited to discuss things, not be hit over the head for someone else's amusement.  It was quite rude, and I think that Ama leaving after the incident should have been expected. The grove is peaceful, by and large, and thus attempts to avoid conflict whenever possible.  Had you asked, perhaps the victim would have warned the other member, and would have played along. It probably would have been funny. Doing it without permission was just rude and disrespectful, not only to him, but to the grove as a whole. We take care of our own, and feel each other's stings."

LordsOfMinecraft,3b965t,Joeylaga,3,Sat Jun 27 02:28:22 2015 UTC,"I like the idea in principle, but in practice, I'm not sure how feasible it is. We have tried similar thing in the past (such as the Cloud's proposal for an inter-district council) but they never got off the ground. The embassy would be limited by the activity and timezones of the ambassadors, since they would need to actually be in the embassy whenever someone else wants to reach them. There could be more than one ambassador (or some sort of staff), but how many people would actually be needed to assure that someone is always there representing a district? 3? 8? More? For small districts like the Sand Dunes, that would be a large chunk of our active population. Also, having a small group of people organizing things behind the scenes, while efficient, smacks of elitism, or the appearance thereof. Even in your post, you refer to non-ambassadors as ""peasants"". We are all peasants, regardless of our position as appointed or elected. While the intention behind this proposal is pure, it could easily be misconstrued or warped.  Sorry for the wall of text for why I don't think it will work, but here are some suggestions that could improve the odds of success:   Weekly Ambassador meetings: This will set a time for ambassadors to meet and allow better organization. It will essentially be an XDM every week, but wouldn't necessarily replace the monthly XDM. Office hours: Ask ambassadors to commit to certain times each week so that others know when they can contact them. However, there is no real way to enforce this, and there has to be some leeway for real-life emergencies.   Again, I really hope this plan succeeds, as it could dramatically improve district relations, which often get strained due to miscommunication. I will be supporting it!"
LordsOfMinecraft,3b965t,Voltage2016,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:16:29 2015 UTC,I think both of your ideas are excellent.  I think 2 ambassadors would be ideal (preferably one for each side of the Atlantic.)

LordsOfMinecraft,3b37d2,SlothFactsBot,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:54:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my sloth go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you."

LordsOfMinecraft,3b28jd,Impuredeath,4,Thu Jun 25 11:24:48 2015 UTC,"Only downside, wheat takes a lot of stamina to grow. People will not be able to make a lot of plots each day, and it will cost them a lot of money that they could have earned in the mines.  But people have a lot more stamina to use nowadays (looking at you Boland), so it's doable. If the paupers adopt this theme I would also suggest adding some scarecrows, and add variation in the fields with carrots and potatoes."
LordsOfMinecraft,3b28jd,istisp,2,Thu Jun 25 11:34:43 2015 UTC,"Personally I suggest sticking mostly with wheat, since other crops have a very bright neon green, which causes a lot of visual contrast."
LordsOfMinecraft,3b28jd,tamwin5,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:13:52 2015 UTC,Won't wheat grow on its own? I know carrots and potatoes will.

LordsOfMinecraft,3b28jd,vector_nova,2,Thu Jun 25 13:59:59 2015 UTC,"Hey guy, I tried to do a similar thing with the Slums, planting carrots,taters, seeds and fake mushrooms to pretty the district up a bit. Problem was when I came back several of the plots were looted, all the crops dug up to be sold for profit.  Very disheartening."
LordsOfMinecraft,3b1ywp,cecilaz,11,Thu Jun 25 09:04:18 2015 UTC,"In the words of Justin, ""wow"". If that happened to me, I would probably just hold the plot out of spite for that. If people want something that doesn't belong to them, they should learn how to ask nicely."
LordsOfMinecraft,3b1ywp,Duffman295,11,Thu Jun 25 11:08:17 2015 UTC,"If in the future this guy is harassing you you can and should report him. Taking an empty plot is fair game and if people had the right to ""own"" all the plots they've ever been on, the server would be empty."
LordsOfMinecraft,3b1ywp,istisp,8,Thu Jun 25 11:44:46 2015 UTC,"You'd be surprised to know that this guy is not alone; I know somebody who received a similar letter after renting a plot that used to be owned by someone else. The crazy part is, she liked the old plot so much that she rebuilt it block for block, then months later, the guy comes back and expects her to give it to him. Some people just feel entitled I guess :/"
LordsOfMinecraft,3b1ywp,vK_InFaMy,8,Thu Jun 25 12:17:47 2015 UTC,"lol. Thats kinda rude, if I was you I would keep it. Im going to send him this link and yeah dont give up. He cant do anything to you, its your plot YOU decide what to do with it. Good Luck m8."
LordsOfMinecraft,3b1ywp,McENEN,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:21:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks xD. I am keeping this plot, I saved golds for all this time because I am building a game with prizes on this plot. I already finish building the game tent a long time ago, but just saving golds for the planned prizes that I have in mind."
LordsOfMinecraft,3b1ywp,McENEN,2,Thu Jun 25 09:37:58 2015 UTC,If I was him and wanted the plot I would do it more nicer. Like if I even didnt want the plot he wanted I would still keep it bc he is very confident about himself getting it.
LordsOfMinecraft,3b1ywp,LoneWo1f1,7,Thu Jun 25 10:23:57 2015 UTC,Sorry about that. I was kind of pissed off my hotel was gone and took it out on you. The letter was meant to be an offer but it ended out as a hate letter. I will attempt to find a new plot that is 400 or more blocks to create my new hotel. Again very sorry that you had to feel bad from my letter. -L0ne
LordsOfMinecraft,3b1ywp,MargravePotifi,8,Thu Jun 25 16:54:56 2015 UTC,"I am sorry that your hotel was gone if it was on that plot, but that was almost 3 months ago m8. Life lesson to you, never take your anger out on anyone and if you want something, learn to ask it nicely as it will carry you farther in life."
LordsOfMinecraft,3b1ywp,Makydog,2,Thu Jun 25 19:02:41 2015 UTC,"Hey, but atleast he said sorry! That is a good first step!"
LordsOfMinecraft,3b1ywp,_Han,5,Thu Jun 25 22:29:37 2015 UTC,"Okay, if you get a chance to respond to this guy, tell him that he shouldn't be getting an emotional connection to something in game. It's like, rule #2 of the server and is in the Welcome Peasant book we all got when we first logged in. This can definitely be seen as harassment, so go ahead and send in a ticket and let the big guys deal with it.  Personally, I'm not a fan of people making these posts instead of sending tickets, but in this case I think you've got a pretty good reason behind you."
LordsOfMinecraft,3b1ywp,Natnif19,6,Thu Jun 25 13:19:30 2015 UTC,"Dude, now you HAVE to keep the plot."

LordsOfMinecraft,3b1ywp,Nightmaresplody,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:01:05 2015 UTC,"Well, that's a weird one!  If you've had the plot for 3 months or so, I take it it was 'green' when you found it? (Since the new 'buildings stay up' thing hasn't been going as long as that, I think...)  Because that is some pretty strong devotion to a particular spot when the previous building is long gone!"

Most likely if there was a war Netherward will join southshire (because they hate DB) and then westshire will loose because all other districts hate communism and will join Southshire's side. But yeah its junk. its like north korea! They have no balls! they wont do jack squat.

Also to 'they hate DB' um.. no... they they don't. It's HIS district they can't not like him.  But to 'they got no balls' m8. Check.. it's ws guns, tanks, bombs, aircrafts and anything remotly hostile is made to be in ws.

Sure it ruins the 'element of surprise', but it's better than ruining someone elses RP. You don't know what they're up to, and to do that without talking to them first is basically forcing RP on them.  There's still ways to maintain the 'element of surprise'. Just let 'em in on it, but don't say when."

I designed my character, I like my character. I do not want to make a new one, or have died and am somehow back alive.   My suggestion is this: Someone can make an assassin board, somewhere. Anyone that is willing to allow their RP character to become assassinated give 250 gold to the owner of the plot for a sign with their minecraft name. To assassinate in this way, you also have to have your name on the board, out of fairness. That way, one can be sure that it's okay to assassinate someone, and do so without tipping them off in any way.  Those are just my two cents; take them for what they are worth."

Honestly I would say that nearly all rp should have some ooc planning, not writing a whole script and such, but let everyone involved have a general idea of whats going on. As long as you manage to keep ooc and ic diffirent, informing, planning and spoiling should rarely be a problem. You could even tell the person when the kill is going to take place, if they are good enough to let their character not act diffirently. Unless it is the kind of assasination where you just backstab someone and thats it, but that would honestly not be much rp for the person getting killed but more for the surrounding people."

They are like gods to us, We obey their every order. And so a lord holds a parade for himself. 100% Fine.

LordsOfMinecraft,3a8g9z,Axeman80,4,Thu Jun 18 07:59:08 2015 UTC,"ooc: Real life does not equal a Role Playing server, what don't you understand about that?"
LordsOfMinecraft,3a8g9z,ColeQM,4,Thu Jun 18 12:38:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because one's in RP and one's not. It makes a difference on an RP server."
LordsOfMinecraft,3a8g9z,istisp,18,Thu Jun 18 13:25:59 2015 UTC,"You obviously misunderstand what rob is trying to get across there. He's doing the exact opposite. The LGBT parade was a peasant suggestion, that was removed because it had the potential to bring political stuff on the server and bring a lot of drama, especially since it didn't really have its place on a RP server where LGBT people are not being oppressed on the city.  But people still wanted it even if the idea was clearly controversial, so instead of removing it, Rob is trying to get the best of both worlds, by keeping it and making it for everyone. Of course it is a clear reference to the real life LGBT pride parades. Except it's a peasant pride parade. It's exactly the same, but more inclusive, without the political drama that could come from it, and with Lord interaction over it. He did it the best he could, and IMO he's doing a pretty good compromise."

LordsOfMinecraft,3a8g9z,Makydog,-5,Thu Jun 18 15:31:32 2015 UTC,"Calm down just in general dude, no one here is 'toxic' to the community people are allowed  to have opinions if we choose to stay off for one day like me and vmware were not 'toxic' to anything were doing something we find is best for all of us and to say 'we don't want you' is incorrect i would like it very much so for vmware to stay he is my FRIEND i don't think anyone over THIS should quit the server mainly when it's almost dead entirely just cause of an opinion dude you honestly need to take a break from this and come back in a few days. But i also agree with you in a sense, i find nothing wrong with a gay pride parade (even though willy removed it and made a peasant parade)  and thats the only thing i agree with you on."
LordsOfMinecraft,3a8g9z,Dimitri_Petrenko,10,Thu Jun 18 20:23:15 2015 UTC,"Well I mean, being a homophobe is generally perceived as being a bit of a dick."
LordsOfMinecraft,3a8g9z,Makydog,-7,Thu Jun 18 14:56:54 2015 UTC,"If he wants to be a 'homophobe' let him it's his choice but to ME and i'm sure others he did't say one thing that made him come off like that and in the end it's his choice his life, if he wants to be a homophobe you can't stop him if that makes him a 'dick' let him can't stop him it's his life he will live it how he wants and just cause you/others misunderstood what he said  don't make him a dick what i got from it is more or less he just anit going to be here the day the parade goes down nor am i but i'm not anti gay or really anti anything see just cause we do this don't mean were 'homophobes'"
LordsOfMinecraft,3a8g9z,Dimitri_Petrenko,11,Thu Jun 18 17:08:40 2015 UTC,"if that makes him a 'dick' let him can't stop him it's his life he will live it how he wants   My mind is just blown by this statement, I'm absolutely baffled. The first rule of the server is ""don't be dick."" This means to be accepting and supportive of other members of the community. The feeling being implied by what he said is that of homophobia, and you can see in the comments that other people do agree with me, and being homophobic breaks the #1 rule. If you don't share those feelings then great, all power to you, but being a dick/mean/rude/whatever is absolutely unacceptable within the community.  Just because it's someone's opinion doesn't mean it's 100% okay or acceptable. This is a bit of an exaggerated comparison, but Hitler had plenty of opinions, so does that him any less of a terrible person? It's like the childhood rule, if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.  In the hopes of keeping drama away from this post as much as possible, if you would like to continue this conversation please do it through PMs rather than just replying to this comment."
LordsOfMinecraft,3a8g9z,kohcoco,-9,Thu Jun 18 17:21:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to debate this anymore due to i'm not in the mood for bullcrap so this is my last response. Yes the 'first rule' is don't be a dick but having an OPINION is not being a dick to me now MY opinion he was't showing any 'homophobic' behavior but yes i agree someone opinion does not make it 100% ACCEPTABLE it's okay due to it's an opinion, it may not be acceptable depending on the opinion. But to 'accepting and supportive' of the community is wrong flat out being non supportive or non accepting don't make you a dick you can be a really accepting fella and a supportive guy but be a total dick and vice versa. I try to be as supportive as i can but there are some people i don't 'accept' mostly for them being dicks and some of them to others are really in your 'acceptive and supportive' ways are nice people. In the end i say let them be them if they wish to be a 'homophobe' LET THEM i'm not saying he is or anyone is i honestly don't care, i don't think it's right to label him a 'homophobe' and a 'dick' due to his opinion."
LordsOfMinecraft,3a8g9z,justdefi,20,Thu Jun 18 17:33:23 2015 UTC,"Being homophobic is being a dick Dimitri. Hating on someone because of a lifestyle choice is exactly the type of fucking thing I would ban for. You are mental if you can't understand that.  We are a accepting community, but no, we are not accepting of hate.   All you gays can go worship yourselves without me. :/   You must be a friend of this guy or something, but I don't know how you could possibly defend this statement. Being ignorant that this is still a very sensitive issue in culture and throwing it out their is 100% being a an asshole. He could have kept it to himself, but he just had to come out here and express himself which is so god damn ironic because he's expressing his hate for OTHER PEOPLE EXPRESSING THEIR LOVE."
LordsOfMinecraft,3a8g9z,ColeQM,43,Thu Jun 18 18:03:20 2015 UTC,"but I will not be logging on that day   Do me a favor and don't come back man. If anyone  knows vmwareguy's minecraft name, submit a ticket for me.  It's not a ""cover up"" you idiot. It is a gay pride parade with a Lords twist. If you do not even have the ability to be open minded enough about other people's life choices, then you are not welcome here at all. It's 2015, at the very least you could keep your opinions to yourself if this is your personal stance in life. Either way do me a favor and stop watching my videos, playing my games, and find a community that will accept you and your blind hate, as while our community aims to accept everyone, we don't accept blind ignorant haters that can't even have the smallest amount of open mindedness.  You want to know what it's like to not be accepted by a community? Alright then, here you go. If you're lucky nobody will know your username and you can live in fear of someone finding out who you truly are and then be persecuted by the entire community for it. Hopefully you enjoy the irony, but it's not really that ironic since you are being persecuted for hate, not love."

Kyle does this once in a while, and will let you know if he's taking requests. Same with Spyd, though Spyd seems to take a lot of requests from his mail.  If you REALLY want this item, so badly you don't care if you get it today or next month, write Nisovin a letter. He takes requests from his mail once in a while when the mood strikes. If you do that, prepare to wait, but if you give your letter an interesting title (and date it), it's more likely to be addressed at some point.  Otherwise getting a request filled like that is the same as anything else on Lords...just gotta be at the right place at the right time."

We had college classes take up most of our time as well as the costs of setting it all up for folks to enjoy. We are also setting up how folks can lease grave plots and crypt spaces. there will be signs folks can post for their departed love ones. Also a small monthly up keep fee being set up. All the plots have donation boxes now so people can add books and gold. We are also setting up a book crypt. the idea is to have three ways to remember love ones. The Temple is under it all. And there is the glass stepping stones for folks to get a view of the Royal Castle as well as to sit and chill. We should have it all finish and ready by July. So stay tune.

LordsOfMinecraft,39uivc,ptWolv022,22,Sun Jun 14 22:08:34 2015 UTC,"If I'm remembering correctly, it's because the system just wasn't working right. The original purpose of the squires was to pretty much be an RP friendly build team that would be very quickly rotated through with different people. The squires then went from that to being pretty much permanent cast members without much of a purpose because the lords saw that it was much more entertaining to focus content on stuff that's going on inside the city with the greater community than to focus on their own closed off little bases.  EDIT: To add to this, if you are asking for them to bring back the squires, then you are incredibly late to the party my friend. That ship has sailed and it isn't coming back."
LordsOfMinecraft,39uivc,Makydog,3,Sun Jun 14 22:33:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know that they won't be brought back( or at least not in a long time if they are). However, Willy has brought up Serfs recently. And shown interest of maybe doing a Serf War. And Serfs are like Squires. Also, really, i thought they made it more interesting. They could make more structures for the Lord's, who could still do city stuff, but still bring things in(Because eventually they'll run out of things to crash into the tower XD). Also, how many plot lines have they just let go? (The dwarven shrine, lazarus dying, Roamin and God, ressurecting Faiden(wait, that was because they got rid of ghosts), Nisovin spying on Rob, Cthulu, also, now the Squire Robot, N150-807(NISO BOT) got forgotten, because he's a squire I guess. Also, WildFallen/falcon's cancer(He's still alive...) and probably other stuff.)   Now I'm just ranting. Still... I wished they'd do something with things outside the city, and maybe do Squires/Serf stuff... sigh"

LordsOfMinecraft,39uivc,grantharshammer,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:16:44 2015 UTC,"Well, no. The reasons you brought up about why they should bring back serfs are also the exact reason why they got axed. They would be spending all of their time most likely alone, outside of the city with just about no in game interaction with anyone inside of the city, building things that may or may not get on camera, aka having absolutely no fun at all. You mentioned serf wars, a function that was behind the original idea behind them, but none of the guys other than Rob or Nisovin really showed an interest in doing them. Also, I'm pretty sure Niso-bot was just an alt of Nisovin's to act as an RP friendly face of the build team, but I might be wrong with that."
LordsOfMinecraft,39uivc,_Han,2,Mon Jun 15 22:30:49 2015 UTC,"I wasn't really saying bring back serfs, just that Willy had brought up maybe using them, which would kinda contradict getting rid of squires.

Don't get me wrong, I like silliness, but without Squires to build things, it gets a little boring. I mean, I loved seeing the Desert base DB has. Which was built by Squires. And the Ongoing Willy base. Made by Megan Yak and Falcon. And Roamania. Made by Faiden and Roamin's other victims- I mean squires(ironically, his squires were more squire like than most,being here, and gone in an instant). Or the Wizard Town Niso's squires made. (Not to mention, the Tower in the City. Half the things crashed in it are squire built. Maybe more.)   sigh ANd there is some more ranting from ole' Wolv (not 021) 022. Also, unrelated, but why, just why, has the joke become that Prince Spyd is a pedophile, not a womanizer like his character was made as? Just why...  Also, I forgot. The whole impregnate Shay plot hasn't been finished. Lords, why... Why can't you finish the stories you make!! (Also, WIlly( or some lord) made a plot for a shrine atop the mountain, and it has never been mentioned in a video, and it is pretty old now. Plotline that was never started?)"
LordsOfMinecraft,39uivc,Hoonter_Uchiha,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:26:45 2015 UTC,"The shrine on top of the mountain is Moova, something having to do with secret elf RP Rob was helping out with. And why is it a bad thing that they are interacting with the larger community? As to why the joke is now that Spyd is a pedophile, because it's funny."
LordsOfMinecraft,39uivc,TheBaldr01,6,Tue Jun 16 03:21:32 2015 UTC,I wont go into details but it was mainly somethings that happened at the lords ball
LordsOfMinecraft,39uivc,Makydog,3,Sun Jun 14 22:12:53 2015 UTC,"No, no it wasn't. Please look at my above comment."
LordsOfMinecraft,39uivc,Makydog,3,Sun Jun 14 22:28:50 2015 UTC,Dude yes you make a good point but i think both of us are right but also the squires died like 2 days after the ball
LordsOfMinecraft,39uivc,blindfoldedchaos,4,Sun Jun 14 22:36:32 2015 UTC,"It was the catalyst that started the end, but the decision to phase out squires had already been made by that point."
LordsOfMinecraft,39uivc,wildorangehead,5,Mon Jun 15 05:16:16 2015 UTC,"Coincidence does not equal causation. Unless I am mistaken, what I said is the explanation Rob gave when they axed the system. He didn't end it because of one single drama event that doesn't need to be brought back up."
LordsOfMinecraft,39uivc,VerySuperNotSpooky,3,Sun Jun 14 22:40:02 2015 UTC,"Hm.. If only lord WIllakers were here. Anyways, Makydog, you're idea seems pretty logical. They do do alot in the city... WHich is slowly getting boring. ANyways, thanks. Now if only Lord Willakers could just settle it."
LordsOfMinecraft,39uivc,Faiden6,5,Sun Jun 14 23:39:13 2015 UTC,"By the way, you can directly respond to a person's comment by hitting the ""reply"" button directly underneath it. And I'm pretty sure what I said is the explanation that Rob gave."
LordsOfMinecraft,39uivc,VerySuperNotSpooky,3,Sun Jun 14 23:55:32 2015 UTC,"Real reason? Apparently it was because it got incredibly boring for some of the squires, considering like 1hr every few days with a lord, the rest spend doing nothing really, (such random builds out there)  becoming as perm as they did was also a reason. also was done for the Serf system which now really has no purpose..  But what would I know, I'm just a pirate"
LordsOfMinecraft,39uivc,WholesaleVirus,2,Mon Jun 15 01:38:27 2015 UTC,Heard it was because of /u/makydog 's reasons and the fact that the lords wanted builds to be more community based

Indeed, just like said the guide helps with starting up but with the guide I still have no idea about the roleplaying, the community (and from what I've seen only today it's huge) and things like that. I think there should be small descriptions on what can be done and what events are commonly hosted in what districts. I only know it from a few areas now and that's only because I walked around a lot in every part of the city.  To make it short, The guide helps with starting up and the explains the know-hows of making money etc but it doesn't explain anything about the community and what type of culture the districts have. If people don't know how to fit in they won't stay long."

If a single person looking at your work and enjoying it isn't enough, then there will never be enough for you to ever feel satisfied.  Don't worry if this is more satirical then anything else, I often respond here not just for you, but for others who may think similar thoughts as yours."
LordsOfMinecraft,39jqjh,Rurikar,11,Fri Jun 12 05:44:53 2015 UTC,I'm glad Rob said it because I feel the same way about making stuff. It honestly only matters if you like what you made.

The fact that someone took time out of their day to create this art in the first place is what always blows me away. There are so many pieces of art in this community alone, all with different styles and inspiration, that it's pretty much impossible to compare them.  TL;DR Art is good, all art is good, is all good."

LordsOfMinecraft,398wc6,Lucimon,2,Wed Jun 10 11:33:29 2015 UTC,I still don't think that makes it okay for one person to own 20 plots

LordsOfMinecraft,398wc6,kookachild,2,Wed Jun 10 17:29:47 2015 UTC,exactly.
LordsOfMinecraft,398wc6,TamTroll,2,Wed Jun 10 17:35:54 2015 UTC,"Well yes and no. Firstly [R] is a large group of people, not one guy. Second, it's a ton of money to hold 3 special/guild plots, 20 normal NW plots, not so much, that's still less than I pay for MQ guild alone. Also, having 20 alts means you're getting 20 times the stam pots and making 20 times the money that you should in the first place. It's taking advantage of irl disposable income to get an advantage over other players, and not really in the spirit of the server.  That being said, I am ok with the build as long as he opens it up to other players when he's done, and doesn't expect Lords to join them all up just for his own sake."
LordsOfMinecraft,398wc6,Kohtalon_,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:22:31 2015 UTC,The point title is trying to make tho is this is one guy with a ton of alts buying up a huge area vs a big group of people working together owning a bunch of plots together
LordsOfMinecraft,398wc6,Jazaiest,2,Wed Jun 10 18:22:35 2015 UTC,"Eh, I wouldn't call it hogging when absolutely nobody else has been interested in those plots for months. If he wants to build something, let him. Doesn't harm anyone else."

LordsOfMinecraft,395vzg,hailthechief1,2,Mon Jun 15 08:55:46 2015 UTC,"Here is my entry, I didn't even want to try to copy paste this into a Minecraft book... it would be a nightmare with its length, if it even fit.  Zenera the Zombie  Heroes come in all shapes and sizes. From big to small, young to old, alive to.... well, dead. If you do not agree, read this story. By the end of it, you will no longer be able to tell me that a zombie cannot be a hero.  For the third time that week, Zenera sat at the Brains N' More café, unsatisfied with the quality of memories she received from the brains she had eaten. She could tell that these weren’t the freshest brains around, but then again, no one was willing to go out in the daytime anymore, not with the recent attacks, and the living seldom threw out brains near the community, with dying being illegal and all. Her mind was starting to become foggy, her own memories from her life had long since been used up, only her name-tag on the tattered remains of her maid outfit reminded her that she had a name. Without fresh memories, Zenera would soon become another one of the catatonic dead that had been cropping up lately.   It was sad, really. Those poor zombies had already died once, had their living death. Now, they were in a state of death after undeath. Eventually, they would fall apart, their meat slipping off their bones as the sun would beat down on them and the wind and rain would wear their flesh away. Perhaps Lord Deadbones would come across them and breath some afterlife back into them. But even then, they would be skeletons, slivers of bones next to their formal, corporal forms. Not her, not Zenra. She would find a new supply of brains, and she would feed. She would also bring those brains back to the catatonic, feed them those precious memories that would give them more unlife. At that stage, stale thoughts were no longer enough for them, just as they were really no longer enough for her. Come nightfall, she would make her way into the market square, damned the consequences.  At nightfall, Zenera gathered a few things. She didn't have much of value, and teeth were probably not going to buy her many brains in the dwarven market. She did have a few of the new cards, though, and she suspected that she could earn a few coins off of them. She shambled her way to the netherward portal, grunting and growling at a few of her friends as she passed by. Working her way up the steps, she wondered if she would be able to find any brains on the other side... at least find any that someone wasn't using.  The somewhat unfamiliar sound of the portal boomed in her mostly empty head, and when it subsided, she was high above DongDank. The fall looked far, but she didn't worry about falling... after all, she was already dead. About halfway to the market portal, she heard a shout. A peasant had seen her, and he was pulling out his pickaxe to attack. Zenera had forgotten that some peasants feared the dead, and others outright hated them. Thinking fast, Zenera ran behind a pillar and consumed one of her few cards. Suddenly, in a puff of smoke, Zenera transformed, looking oddly enough like her living-self. The peasant ran around the corner, pickaxe raised, and stopped short when he saw the beautiful maid standing there. He apologized for his aggressive stance, put his pickaxe away, and walked off scratching his head. If Zenera had lungs, she would have breathed in a sigh of relief. After the close encounter, she walked to the market portal and again waited for the sound. Zenera appeared on the other side of the portal. She was greeted by all kinds of noise. People were selling rare items; some were chatting, others appeared to be fighting. A group of people were dancing around another, chanting her name over and over. Not used to all the noise, Zenera was quite confused, but she figured that the best place to start would be a shop.   After a while of looking for a shop, she finally found one. She walked in and looked at a menu... There were no brains on it! Deciding that it couldn't hurt to ask, she asked the worker at the bar. The employee blankly stared at her, pulled out a whip, and snapped it on her. Now standing outside the shop, on the cobble road, Zenera became dejected. How would she find brains for her and the others if she was whipped from the first shop that she checked? Why would any of the other shops act differently? Sadly, she started walking back to the portal, sure that she too would become a mindless zombie, and maybe one day become a skeleton.   As she neared the portal, she heard a voice pierce through the crowd saying: Selling body parts! A new batch just grew in! Interested, but thinking that it was probably a joke, Zenera walked up to where the voice was coming from. It appeared to be coming from an arbor next to a few park-benches It was hard to make him out, but a plant-man was standing in the arbor. Zenera watched as a peasant exchanged gold for a heart.   Zenera walked up to the plant-man, after the other peasant left, and asked him if he still had his brain for sale. He explained that he did, and that it cost  8 cold coins. Zenera pulled out one of her few remaining cards and asked him if it would cover the cost. His eyes grew wide as he looked upon a Lord Roamin card. He explained that the card was worth far more than 8 coins, and that if she would give it to him as payment, he would have a new brain for her every day for as long as they would grow. From that day forward, the Zombies shared his freshly grown brain, and they returned to their former, undead selves.  So, you see, heroes come in all shapes and sizes. While few would argue that Electricity Man is a hero, many might claim that Zenera is not. However, through her bravery she was able to help herself and others. Through her generosity, the Zombies of the neatherward would no longer be brain dead, they would have new unlife. To those zombies, Zenera is very much a hero.  I hope you all enjoy it. I had fun writing it.  _^"

I never meant for this post to start any more disputes or arguments between  our group and yours as I only intended to spark up a bit of fun rp.

LordsOfMinecraft,38vww2,firebolt8900,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:35:53 2015 UTC,"Sounds in each district would get annoying and tiring fast. And the themes of some of those districts could cause problems for other districts. I.E. Royal music for Mainstreet might sound like a good idea, but could give other districts the wrong idea. Even if something like this is implemented (and to be fair I hope it isn't) some of the themes might need to be rethought to not give other districts the wrong impression.  As far as why I don't think it should be implemented? Mostly because it could get annoying very quickly. Yes, you could turn down game volumes. But I don't want to be running through a district and have to turn down my volume because of annoying music being played in that district. If something like this went into place, I'd love for it to be a toggled so you had the option of turning it on or off without it affecting game sounds."

LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,SugoiBakaMatt,22,Fri Jun 5 16:10:51 2015 UTC,"I would really like to echo this.  Walking around the town, it's disheartening to see the amount of plots that get destroyed because people think that it's okay to smash up the place, not just in the Grove, but everywhere.  I've only done a few rejuvenated plots, and I left a starter package in them, in the form of a few tools, a gold bar and any blocks I had left over. I came back only a day later to find one of the places ransacked and even a little destroyed.  All they got out of it was one gold bar.  I just wonder at some point whether these people would like it if someone came into their home and just trashed the place, all just to get a gold bar or two.  This place isn't a sunken sea ship that might have some treasures here or there, it is a place that most of us actually enjoy living in and looking at."
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,charliemadman,7,Fri Jun 5 16:47:52 2015 UTC,"NEVER leave chests on a plot you want to stay in one piece. While some treasure hunters will avoid doing any damage to a plot, others will trash buildings after they have finished looting. I've done a fair bit of ""treasure hunting"" myself and this is the system I've set up. I've checked up on the plots I've done this with, and they seem more likely to stay in one piece.   Break every chest you see. If ""bad-looters"" don't see any chests on the plot, they will be less likely to /rent it (and trash it afterwards). I know chests are expensive, and you may want to leave a new renter with gifts or expensive blocks. But in my opinion at least, that is outweighed by the damage done by destructive looters. If looters cannot get into a room, they are more likely to /rent it in order to get access. And once they have checked, and found the room empty, they may end up trashing the whole plot. Leave access open to otherwise locked-off places.   Granted, this will only stop looters. People that are destroying plots just for the sake of destroying plots will most likely do so all the same. But it does minimize the risk of damage."
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,_Han,6,Fri Jun 5 21:25:06 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, you misunderstand my comment.   I know how the looters work, I wasn't really looking for advice.   I've been marking out the plots in the same way as everyone else, with the steps around the outside. Also, due to how expensive plots can be, I've only been placing basic structures.   I assumed people would see that it was a basic rejuvenated plot and some common sense might kick in to not loot it because there wasn't anything on it.  To be honest, I find the whole treasure hunting thing disappointing. Once again, the few are spoiling it for the many."
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,charliemadman,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:59:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was thinking more on the lines of abandoned plots, since they are more often targets for looters."
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,_Han,16,Sat Jun 6 00:55:18 2015 UTC,"I thought this might happen, there really is not a whole lot we can do. You can report players for this as it very much bad fellowship of the server to go around from plot to plot ransacking them in this way.  Me and Nisovin will think about what we can do to solve these types of problems, but since this is a public server and anyone can buy a plot like this, I'm not sure there is a great solution. I have some ideas, but they will also put some restrictions on even doing something like a restoration project in the districts."
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,Rurikar,2,Fri Jun 5 22:01:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure there's anything you can do that would completely solve this problem. It's just the result of a few bad apples within the community. Some people will be jerks, and there's not much anyone can do about that."
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,Kohtalon_,10,Sat Jun 6 02:18:30 2015 UTC,"Apart from the fact that most of the hidden chests in rejuvenated plots are meant to be for the person that eventually buys them, as a sort of welcome greeting, which adds to the sense of community spirit that this whole project is supposed to be about. Grabbing everything for yourself is selfish and will ultimately just lead to us not leaving anything on plots anymore.   (note: this is different to organised scavenger hunts, where it would be appreciated if you left clues to a specific plot or some sign to indicate that a chest is part of the game)"
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,Ginauz,10,Fri Jun 5 17:23:58 2015 UTC,"^ This. I stopped bothering putting things on plots because I would just come the next day and find the plots I'd edited dug up and ransacked. Turn off your xray texture packs guys, the one gold bar in the chest is not for you."
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,McENEN,2,Fri Jun 5 17:46:29 2015 UTC,We just dont have to put any gold there
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,Ginauz,2,Fri Jun 5 17:51:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly, like I said I stopped doing it. Would rather give gold to someone new then someone who runs around taking everything"
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,Tripleat,3,Fri Jun 5 18:03:59 2015 UTC,"Yea I genuinely don't ever leave chests on plots that I've spruced up, and if I ever do that I'll just have the chest in an obvious area so they don't go tearing through the plot to find it, so it at least stays pretty.  I've Actually seen one or two plots I've rejuvenated actually find owners which is really awesome to see,  Which is amazing so when I see this it's so disheartening. And I know which plots these are so it's even more annoying, because they had nothing except these flowers :/"
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,McENEN,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:00:29 2015 UTC,I think it cost more to rent the plot than 1gb
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,Lucimon,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:13:48 2015 UTC,"This is true. In order for it to be worth the 1gb I think the plot would have to be in the slums, pauper, or a really small plot. Most plots cost (from my experience) 2+ gb for the initial 10 days."
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,McENEN,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:50:06 2015 UTC,"yeah, and the question why do they even greef, they dont like to look at districts?"
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,AmarielSilme,8,Fri Jun 5 19:27:10 2015 UTC,I've dumped 4 diamonds into the Grove already. It's really disheartening to see this...
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,wanderingfalcon,6,Fri Jun 5 18:48:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not gonna lie, I was pretty bummed about this. it's not just treasure hunting because I made these to be flower fields where almost every single space was a flower, so there was apparently a flower picking expedition on most of these plots. I did take down one of the golem plots to complete the flower rainbow and covered the ground underneath one of them (but there are like, 26 of them so I don't think it was a huge deal)  Obviously I don't mind if you rent one of the flower plots and build something on it (someone made a giant tulip), but yea, this was a bummer.   Note to treasure hunters: I was going to make some plots with buried dinosaurs in them for builders to excavate, but now I don't really feel like it.  There's no chests to find on any of my renovated grove plots."
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,rustydawgt,6,Fri Jun 5 20:22:58 2015 UTC,Thats so rude D:
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,ShifuSheep,5,Fri Jun 5 18:43:59 2015 UTC,"Just trashing plots like this is just rude, but if you leave treasure chests in a plot you can't expect that it'll be untouched for the player who decides to live there. Peasants get curious, and someone without a plot might jump on it and take the items. Unless it's clear that you're not supposed to take it, peasants could want to go treasure hunting for these chests that are left out in the open."
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,Krafter640,4,Fri Jun 5 23:30:54 2015 UTC,"Plot looting is an accepted passtime in Dong Dank. I loot every once in a while, provided it is an abandoned home with chests in it that I think I would find cool stuff in. In my thinking, roughing up the place afterwards is an aspect of roleplay. Unless it is a monumental work of architecture, I'll often smash in a few windows or tear out a floorboard or two as well as boarding up the door. I never grief plots to the point that they are hideous; just enough to say ""Hey this building is abandoned and already looted. Looters move on."" Looting decoration plots is rediculous however. Griefing for griefing's sake is just uncool. Where's the roleplay in tearing up flowerfields that others made for fun? (Unless you guys are hiding chests on the plot with loot for some reason)"
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,THStheThird,4,Sat Jun 6 10:09:19 2015 UTC,"This sort of thing makes me borderline angry (not totally angry because that's illegal XD), not so much about the loss of investment or bad 'sportsmanship' of the whole treasure thing. It is the severe lack of respect towards the people that did all this, if you do go around digging up plots, clean them up and make them look like what they once were. We didn't do all of this to have a massive treasure hunt, we made it so the place looks nice the treasure ONLY being a byproduct of that."
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,Lucimon,3,Sat Jun 6 10:00:21 2015 UTC,Agreed. It would be especially helpful if the person/people organizing the hunts hid the treasures in ways that nothing has to be broken. Just put behind a trapdoor. Or behind an iron door with no lever or button so the hunter has to buy one.
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,zwind,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:43:56 2015 UTC,Well you can just remove the wall around the chest to get to it.
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,_Han,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:07:47 2015 UTC,"Actually, this is the exact opposite of what you want to do. If a person is curious about what's behind the door, buys the plot, and finds that nothing is on it, they may actually just end up trashing the entire building."
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,Obsidious_D,5,Fri Jun 5 21:25:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't like the idea of taking things from abandoned plots at all. I think that the people who actually purchase the plot to keep it should get whatever was on the plot. Blatantly griefing plots like this is unacceptable."
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,wanderingfalcon,2,Fri Jun 5 20:43:05 2015 UTC,"It's acceptable because its possible, and once you give up a plot you have given up ownership of it. Anyone doing plot restoration has to consider this as a possibility.  It's kind of a jerk move, though, and it discourages people from investing much time, effort and gold into the project."
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,Tripleat,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:10:10 2015 UTC,On top of that you should be well are aware that when you let a plot's rent run out you lose anything on that plot. And for a system where you get everything that you had on your plot there really is no easy way to do that. :/
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,soandso2,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:21:28 2015 UTC,":( It's sad seeing stuff like this. If we could see the last three people on a plot, maybe people would be less likely to grief like this?"
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,wanderingfalcon,3,Fri Jun 5 18:39:09 2015 UTC,"there's always going to be a risk of griefing on something like this, same as there will always be a risk that someone you add to a plot can grief it.  Its kind of a given that if we renovated plots and leave them, someone can come and change it."
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,Tripleat,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:26:20 2015 UTC,I guess it can be part of the job of the grove gardeners to make sure plots are cleaned up and fixed :) it might be costly to maintain but I think the benefits are more than worth it

LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,Nicci_Galanohel,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:08:21 2015 UTC,"I think that showing the last owner of the plot would be a deterrent to griefers. If you come across a plot that is wrecked, you could report it, and maybe those people could be dealt with somehow. The thing I love about this community is that a vast majority of the people playing are truly just nice people with respect for others. It's sad that some people are just jerks..."
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,flammonster,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:13:20 2015 UTC,there ave been multible people going around buying plots and griefing them which it happened to one of the people from netherward they bought it back and fixed it but it just sucks :/
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,Sanguimaru,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:04:20 2015 UTC,"In an unfortunate way, we've created our own problems by hiding treasures in the plots. We have given people an incentive to go around and dig at the unused plots to see if they can find things.  That being said, yeah, if you see someone just digging at the plots to make a mess, go talk to them and ask them to stop. If they're actually treasure hunting, ask them to fill up the holes that they have dug when they are finished."
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,Krafter640,1 point,Sat Jun 6 07:22:08 2015 UTC,"Wait there is treasure hidden on the plots? Like more than just blocks? If so, this griefing is to be expected. If there's loot, looters will come to find it, and they may get overzealous with their roleplay. Unless these chests are buried randomly throughout the plots, in which case all these holes are to be expected."
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,Nicci_Galanohel,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:21:48 2015 UTC,"It doesn't give them any right to leave the plots destroyed. It doesn't take much time to respect the previous owner and try to keep the plot mostly intact.   Then, before abandoning it, they should fix it so that other's work isn't ruined. It's just common decency... something sorely lacking these days."
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,Krafter640,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:15:48 2015 UTC,"Eh, in my view, hiding loot on the plot just invites people to do this. Decoration plots should have nothing of value on them. You can't bury treasure on a plot and expect someone to not dig around for it. And the people doing it are going to be roleplaying as ""bad guys""; they're looters and aren't going to pretty up the places they loot. Putting anything of value on these plots— burying them like treasure nonetheless— was a really bad move for people who made these plots."
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,Boolderdash,2,Sat Jun 6 12:41:26 2015 UTC,"The thing is, it's not just happening to people who hide loot on the plot. People who make nice houses are getting them smashed up either because people are jerks, or because people think there might be treasure hidden there.  In hindsight, Rob mentioning the idea of treasure hunts on these plots in his announcement was probably a mistake, since now some people have it in their heads that every plot on the server might have some loot hidden in the walls. That said, I don't really blame him for it, since the idea of treasure hunting on these plots is a really cool idea, it just... kind of hasn't worked out too well."
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,Nicci_Galanohel,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:36:30 2015 UTC,"The problem is this: Many of the plots didn't contain treasure. They were strictly for beautification, but people dig them up looking anyway. I think that if someone wants to hide things, it needs to be marked on the plot with a sign, or something. That way, people will know the plot is free game. Otherwise, they will dig up everything in order to find nothing except irritated people that spent time and money making something beautiful."
LordsOfMinecraft,38onyk,kookachild,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:52:49 2015 UTC,"In my view, I don't really partake in looting or rejuvenation of districts but I like the ideas of both of them. First off, looters would be there when there are plots far out of town, no one bothered about them, they need money and gamble in trying to get some, an abandoned building is surely to have someone trying to snoop around it and see what is in it, or avoid it because ghosts...  If someone has a normal house and has abandoned it then those people who want quick cash can loot it, unless they get attacked by an angry mob of people who don't want there abandoned buildings looted. I just think it is RP but more than an evil one, something people can utilize in the paladins update.  Secondly, the rejuvenation of districts, I love this idea so much and it looks awesome so far but like this, you don't go and start breaking blocks on a small park, that doesn't have anything to do with money, doing that is what I don't like. They know they will get nothing out of it but they still do it.   So I guess on the neighbourhood view looting is seen as a bad thing in RP, I think it should stay as RP and nothing hated for out side of RP  Looters looting I find is a good RP thing and could get more poeple to interact with one another.  But I think server wide destroying parks and monuments is a big no no. There is nothing gained from you going out to someone's park  that has nothing inside and destroying it. That is just awful.   I also think that many people who have got a neighbourhood with abandoned buildings inside could easily go and create some sort of housing estate agents, as long as it is Lords friendly. I dunno, would just find that cool :P  Anyways, that is my view on this and my view means nothing but whatever I am saying it anyways and no one can stop me! Apart from the moderators... and anyone who reports this comment..."

LordsOfMinecraft,38lr6l,Duffman295,7,Fri Jun 5 01:16:42 2015 UTC,"It's not repairing them technically. Tools never take durability when you break blocks but your client thinks they do. The damage you can see on your tools are just caused by a lack of synchronization between the server and your client, it's a bukkit limitation. What right clicking does is that it forces an update to your client so you can see what damage it actually has. It's the same thing that happens when you try to stack food items, the client thinks you can stack them but the server doesn't actually stack them, and you are only informed when you try to move the food items.  That's why damage caused by fighting is not repaired. It actually takes durability from fighting, so even when you right-click it does not come back.  Actually, I like the repairing explanation better. It's more roleplay than the boring technical explanation."

LordsOfMinecraft,38h1ru,Spydster,6,Thu Jun 4 14:54:34 2015 UTC,"I'm bored.   For your sake, if you don't want to read the two life stories that follow this post; spend your time on someone like Negnar_Holf instead and watch him do something for a hour. I go by many things, but you can call me Koi, Robin, or David. I've been on LoM ever since it the started in the summer of PMC in 2014; and I can say for myself that I have seen things that not even a 20 year-old should see, and this year, my life has really turned upside down.   So out of character, let me reintroduce myself. I'm David, a 13 year-old kid who likes rock. My parents divorced when I was four, and ever since I lived with my mother. Two years later she gets re-married to some soldier in the US army. Four years later, tensions rise and eventually my step-father kicks us out by the time I was ten. Obviously, my life was impacted because I was subject to these depressing and climatic moments at such a young age. Before we moved however; my brother at the wedding meets my mom's new boyfriend (the new boyfriend being the US soldier) and tells my mom that he is an absolute asshole and that he should get away from him. Surely enough in the January of 2015, he throws us out so he can marry his new fiance. So in the 6th grade, my mom and I move back to Texas the following year. And it was also in this moment in time that I was severely suffering from depression.  So now I am living in a trailer writing this so I can say one thing to the people I barely know, Thank you. Seriously, just thank you. Thank you to the Buffalo Wizards, to Negnar_Holf, to Crayneal, to the ""I want my kidneys"" man (vmwareguy?), to Deadbones... just thank you to the 2000+ people who barely knew me and secretly supported me in a rough time by being there for me. So... I don't know. I just vented out some heavy shit in my life."

And that wouldn't solve the case of random people just buying a plot in the barrens desert and change it back to an ugly green plot just to get loots from eventual chests.  And that wouldn't even be worth it. The time you spend to farm gold to get the money needed to reset your plot, you could as well use it to tear your plot down. Given how boring jobs are on the long run, I prefer doing something different by breaking blocks with a pickaxe. :P  Finally, it's not roleplay-friendly anyway.

LordsOfMinecraft,37umq0,Makydog,5,Sat May 30 20:19:55 2015 UTC,"I am not a mod, nor do I (or should I) have any say in what the rules are, why they are, or how they're enforced.  That bein' said, I agree with the overall rule that links not be allowed in general chat. I also feel like even LoM/Bwiz specific links shouldn't be allowed, simply because it's REALLY easy to fake a link that looks official at a glance. That's just my opinion, though.  The thing is, when people post links in general chat it's just so danged hard for the actual moderators to, well, moderate. It's not like Twitch chat, where a bad link can get removed. You can (and should) report someone if they post a malicious link in chat, but doing so doesn't make it go away. Nothing but waiting it out will really make it go away, and in that time, especially in peak hours in the Summer, potentially hundreds of people can be exposed to that link.  I feel like even if we allow 'safe' links, like links to official BWiz websites, or strawpolls, or the subreddits, or whatever people insist are benign, the rule would become completely unenforceable. Every link has to be checked by someone, and in the event that it is a bad link, it's not going to go away until whichever chat channel it was posted in pushes it off.  Again, though. Just my opinion on the matter."

They didn't cut southshire in half and change all the colours into grey for many residents? They didn't blow up redacted? What about painting brickton green? (Though many liked it!) putting a sewege plant in the magic quarter, angering nisovin!  Dude whenever ANY of this stuff happens to ANYONE else your 100% cool with it and never bring it up, But when it happens to effect you, It is ""Not okay"" and ""Picking on the grove"".

LordsOfMinecraft,37g1jd,McENEN,2,Wed May 27 15:14:06 2015 UTC,"I got hired on a few plots randomly. So what I did was... ignore it. If people are /hiring you to a plot 9 times out of 10, they're also adding other randos as well.  And if they aren't, they're probably doing it to seem like they have more people employed and that's it's more popular.  If you think about it, those that know you will realise that you probably won't have wanted to be added to a random plot in another district, and those that don't know you can just be told about the case if they ask.  Most people on the server are aware that there are some people /hiring randos and everyone, so it's really not that hard to explain."

If you are affluent and know you are better than other peasants try cloud Kingdom because they are rich.  If you  have a devious streak and love to stir up trouble go Netherward.

LordsOfMinecraft,37dvy4,Makydog,2,Tue May 26 22:34:04 2015 UTC,I completely forgot about death being illegal. Still it would be nice if jail were better.
LordsOfMinecraft,37dvy4,QueenMisread,6,Wed May 27 00:39:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to lie...the /stuck feature in jail was kind of convenient in the last few weeks. Someone in our group picked a plot right in front of where you /stuck out of jail and put in a hangout area with chairs and a small bar area so people could go sit there to wait out their jail sentences. Within the last few weeks, this plot also expanded downstairs so there was a hangout area down there as well.  It got to the point where it wasn't just our group using this jailbreak hangout but other people using it as well. We'd go over there from time to time and see people sitting on the benches and since we had food and cakes on the plot, we would just throw them out to those people and they seemed to really enjoy the plot and being able to hangout and wait out jail sentences without being stuck in jail.  I get the purpose behind the jail and definitely think for serious offences (annoying Lords, etc.) the /stuck feature should be disabled. But perhaps for minor things such as death or being whipped off a plot, maybe /stuck can still be an option. The most a person can do is try to jump from chair to chair in time. But for the jailbreak hangout, it would still make it possible to hangout with people currently in jail without being stuck in jail the duration of the time."
LordsOfMinecraft,37dvy4,Yogstarjr27,2,Tue May 26 23:42:01 2015 UTC,It was disabled..
LordsOfMinecraft,37dvy4,QueenMisread,1 point,Wed May 27 00:32:09 2015 UTC,I know it was disabled :P  I meant that for the lesser offences the /stuck commanded should be re-enabled to be used.

LordsOfMinecraft,37dvy4,icefirestorm,4,Wed May 27 00:40:19 2015 UTC,"Here's an idea: Two different jails. One jail would be for the ones who have done malicious acts to place them in jail (Being whipped off a plot, Death by a lord, things that would be taken as 'Evil'). The other jail would be for those who have done things in rp (/seppuku) or just simply died in a lava pit.   Just an idea, thought I should share this :)  EDIT: Forgot to mention: The jail for malicious acts would be hell themed; Perhaps even boring so others wouldn't want to commit the crimes in the first place. The other jail could be heaven themed; bright and colorful. Just so if players did die without any malicious acts leading to their demise; they wouldn't mind coming to this area for ~10 minutes."

LordsOfMinecraft,37dvy4,Sekka3,1 point,Wed May 27 00:14:56 2015 UTC,I think a job that pays in jail would somehow get taken advantage of. But some sort of activity would make it a ton better.

LordsOfMinecraft,37af2e,CashQM,2,Wed May 27 02:09:41 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming the one that's saying ""Fuck you!"" and ""Wait, I don't want to be seen outside like this!"" is Science and that's probably the most important one to recognize. :P  I think the British sounding girl is Octarock. The other one who talks often I think is Rayney. I don't know who the third one is, might be Coebot/Hanhula or Vinyle_octavia?   The one who says, ""Mine has a little-"" I assume is EnderInheritor, since he is also wearing a maid outfit, and since FunkehMelon looks like he's wearing a suit. So, i'd assume the last male voice, saying ""He's making a run for it"" is Melon.   Course, I don't actually know if any of this is true! So excuse me if I'm wrong.     Totally unrelated, but it looks like he's wearing a pink bra when Funkeh goes into him while they're climbing the stairs. :3"

LordsOfMinecraft,379fyf,Nightmaresplody,2,Tue May 26 02:35:57 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering how much you should be allowed to alter plots. No one's going to dare building offensive things everywhere, but what if someone wanted to make actual buildings for the sake of making an area look less empty? They would be hollow buildings for easy demolition of course, or even just decorative walls...almost like scene backdrops. Easy enough to renovate if someone sees potential in them, but clearly identifiable as empty. It may even attract more people to build in the area than empty plots would if there was a theme to the area."
LordsOfMinecraft,379fyf,mrhello3846,2,Mon May 25 23:58:43 2015 UTC,"We're doing that as well, go have a look at the Race track in NW.  We have agreed to avoid doing that in busier sections though, since a built plot can easily make new people not even bother looking to see if it is available.  The idea now is to put down Orange clay in place of green, and include a sign with the comment that it is available, and the monthly, and daily rent info to make it easy for perspective buyers.  We'll likely do the same for plots that have been abandoned when we notice them."

LordsOfMinecraft,3794vh,Sekka3,1 point,Tue May 26 09:06:29 2015 UTC,"No. A. Hair is nonessential while leaves are essential B. Those are cherry blossoms. Cherry Blossoms aren't leaves. C.

LordsOfMinecraft,3794vh,hughesbros3,0,Wed May 27 00:11:51 2015 UTC,Leaves are definatly hair they are at the top of the tree where hair would be and its pink so I say death to the tree!
LordsOfMinecraft,3794vh,Sekka3,0,Wed May 27 07:18:15 2015 UTC,"If that's true, then a pink leather helmet = hair. Anything pink you put on your head would therefore be hair. With that logic, the Rainbow Cat, any pink leather helmet, or anything pink you place on your head would be illegal. So anything pink on your head means you're committing a crime. So anything you place on your head is your hair, which means anything pink even the slightest atom of pink is illegal.  So go check your head for pink stuff. Plus, the pink is on the branches. In a way, the head of the tree is the top. These branches would be equivalent to appendages sprouting from your head, not your head itself"

LordsOfMinecraft,378pxj,lotloxa,2,Mon May 25 20:21:02 2015 UTC,Its 8 items per crate :)
LordsOfMinecraft,378pxj,Double_Dash123,2,Mon May 25 20:07:40 2015 UTC,thank you :) but is the Aint easy contract worth it if you only get 24 items?
LordsOfMinecraft,378pxj,SystemOctave,5,Mon May 25 20:09:06 2015 UTC,You get more than one crate per food item. Most foods have around 40 crates or more.
LordsOfMinecraft,378pxj,Double_Dash123,2,Mon May 25 20:25:45 2015 UTC,"It really depends on your restaurant. I think the ain't easy and the tuna bandit ones are the lest popular (once again I dont know for sure) but some restaurants, like mine, have every contract for shits and giggles so we don't really care about what's good and what's bad. For starter contracts Pizza, Drinks or Sweet Eats are probably the best since people enjoy them the most. Its all up to you and what your business is like. Every contract has its ups and downs."
LordsOfMinecraft,378pxj,EonDragon,2,Mon May 25 20:18:08 2015 UTC,I believe you get 64 crates of each food with that contract. (Correct me if i am wrong.)
LordsOfMinecraft,378pxj,Kohtalon_,2,Mon May 25 20:25:34 2015 UTC,"3 foods x 64 crates each x 8 items per crate = 1536 food items. Yeah, it's a lot. (personally Ain't Easy is my favourite contract because bunnies, but then I only use it for personal supply of food/giving away for free, and I still haven't run out of my original contract from when the mall opened.)"
LordsOfMinecraft,378pxj,charzard4261,0,Mon May 25 20:29:19 2015 UTC,"I think if it doesn't state an amount, it gives 1"
LordsOfMinecraft,377ln0,bayboy02,15,Mon May 25 15:17:00 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea, but perhaps in order to keep it from being abused, have it cost gold for each time you change the destination."
LordsOfMinecraft,377ln0,zwind,1 point,Mon May 25 15:28:22 2015 UTC,How much do you think we should pay for each trip?
LordsOfMinecraft,377ln0,LemonWoodTree,1 point,Tue May 26 02:39:22 2015 UTC,"It would be free to use, but if you had it set to the racetrack and then change it to Mainstreet Park, it costs gold.  I am not one to say what prices should be. Though it should be small enough people can afford it, but large enough where people won't constantly change it."
LordsOfMinecraft,377ln0,zwind,1 point,Tue May 26 02:47:48 2015 UTC,I think a good price would be 300 gold. It's sorta in between the cost of a shardstone and a homestone.
LordsOfMinecraft,377ln0,jaxder_jared,1 point,Tue May 26 03:19:29 2015 UTC,"Not a bad price. Its slightly above the price of signs, and those are expensive to keep people from buying tons of signs.  Another balancing feature could be that the charge-time could be longer than a homestone (currently, homestones take about 2x as long as a shardstone to charge up)."
LordsOfMinecraft,377ln0,iamtallerthanyou,2,Tue May 26 23:15:06 2015 UTC,That sounds like the airport rods. Too bad they are broken...

LordsOfMinecraft,377ln0,jaxder_jared,2,Tue May 26 02:40:06 2015 UTC,"We have so many portals to things. It doesn't hurt to walk a little bit from the nearest portal to the landmarks that you like, does it?  That being said, I think that the racetrack could eventually be due for a warp pipe, but it's really easy to walk to from the Nether Ward portal."
LordsOfMinecraft,377ln0,istisp,1 point,Tue May 26 05:27:27 2015 UTC,You can also take the cardshop warp pipe. Its an even shorter walk.

LordsOfMinecraft,375x3e,Hanhula,12,Mon May 25 04:18:23 2015 UTC,"While I understand why you would want too, today we had the problem of the server being completely full.  I honestly don't care until it is a problem and it has now become a problem which means we have to make clear rules for it and it means stuff like this most likely has to go."
LordsOfMinecraft,375x3e,Hanhula,7,Mon May 25 06:10:05 2015 UTC,"Potentially would this mean that so long as it's in no danger of overloading the server (like, in the middle of the American night when 6 people are on), it'd be okay to do such roleplay stuff or record vids with alts?  Although, I'm guessing a majority of the current stress is due to the global stam pots. Friends I know who have ridiculous amounts of alts have been keeping 4 - 10 of them online to get more stamina potions, which is kinda ridiculous. With the amount of players LoM has, this is probably what's causing the server to hit capacity. Hopefully the new rule'll stop this, and if it does, maybe you could add in  specific exceptions for RP and video purposes?"
LordsOfMinecraft,375x3e,Hanhula,14,Mon May 25 06:19:48 2015 UTC,I will put some consideration into a way we can balance the rule.

LordsOfMinecraft,375x3e,wanderingfalcon,1 point,Mon May 25 15:45:09 2015 UTC,What do you think of this idea... For people who use alternate accounts... They would have to register them as an alt of their main account. Then they would perhaps not recieve daily bonuses. This could help both balance the game and help with people idling for daily items taking up slots on the server because there is no benifit.
LordsOfMinecraft,375x3e,Hanhula,2,Mon May 25 23:39:36 2015 UTC,Not doable without a massive amount of work involved.

LordsOfMinecraft,375x3e,Ginauz,1 point,Mon May 25 05:23:54 2015 UTC,So uh kind of a noob question: IF me and my brother are on the same internet (we use one cause its way stronger then our other internet) is that logging in with the same IP? Keep in mind that my brother plays on a Laptop while I play on my PC.  edit: I made this comment because I was wondering if this is ok. We play together on LoM but I don't want to take up spots that other very active players (my bro isnt that active he logs on does his stamina then we RP a bit the he leaves :P)
LordsOfMinecraft,375x3e,charliemadman,3,Mon May 25 03:54:41 2015 UTC,"From what was said, this would be ok if others don't exploit the system. I imagine if Rob wanted to check your case, if you were both moving and doing stuff at the same time, he would be able to see you two both working.  If he is only logging in for a brief bit, I imagine it would be ok. I think the main problem is taking up slots for a long period of time whilst just being afk."

LordsOfMinecraft,375x3e,cboland,4,Mon May 25 06:44:47 2015 UTC,"Yea, but the extra cooldown will just hurt those of us without alts as we would get even less than we already do.

LordsOfMinecraft,375x3e,ArchmageTolvan,1 point,Mon May 25 14:23:15 2015 UTC,It shouldn't be a huge setback but for the Dankey Dash Barrik logs in his alt to check if people cheat during the race and use their shardstone to get back to the portal hub faster.  We could always see about having someone else doing it for us though.
LordsOfMinecraft,375x3e,Alsnake55,1 point,Mon May 25 15:34:19 2015 UTC,I assume logging 2 accounts on at once for about 2 mins to give it access to a plot would be allowed as it isn't just filling player spots

LordsOfMinecraft,3769gt,istisp,1 point,Mon May 25 13:51:36 2015 UTC,"The decision to how districts are delimited is up to the Lords and the players, and can be let to everyone's own interpretation. The three only objective characteristics that can let you decide if a plot belong to a district or another are the block palette, the /plotinfo output and the /region chat.  If you prefer to consider the first two, then the Magic Tower is different from the Magic Quarter. Their /plotinfo are different, so are their block palettes. Although the block palettes are actually quite similar if you ignore some blocks from the Magic Tower.  If you consider the latter, then they are in the same district, since they share their region chat. But the Cloud District also shares its region chat with the Pauper's and players don't unanimously consider them the same district.  Anyway, if you're the kind of player who consider paupers and the slums to be the same district, you can logically consider the MQ and the tower to be the same district as well. But that is up to everyone's interpretation."

Instead, the council gave us full Diplomatic Autonomy and thus ""Mikelandia"" Was formed!

LordsOfMinecraft,374jn8,NaquIma,1 point,Sun May 24 23:56:48 2015 UTC,"Sadly yes... Optifine is required. I learned that the hard way making my DvZ pack. Optifine does this thing where it can read an ""mcpatcher"" folder added to a resourcepack. In the ""mcpatcher"" folder would be clouds, stars, SHOOTING STARS (my personal favorite), color shades of the sky, and some random things with (rain?) water. Honestly it took me days to figure out how to use these things. I still don't know anything about them. It was just experimentation.  Normal Minecraft can't read it so its hard for pack makers to really do anything nice with the sky unless Optifine is used... Personally I love it but if it is not workable for a server pack, I'd still love looking at it by myself...  I hope this short explanation was nothing but useful    :)"
LordsOfMinecraft,374jn8,stranker21,1 point,Mon May 25 02:29:44 2015 UTC,Makes sense. I wasn't sure if the sun and moon counted or not. But yeah changing the sky requires optifine after testing it. Oh well.

There was a bit said just after about how selling plots would still not be allowed? I should've screenshotted it at the time, but it was late.  I like the idea of building something and moving on - I have a main plot that I live on, but I have an alt I bought one day I was ill and just felt like building something new, intending to leave and do other things, but I like the wee build! If I can move on and someone else can have fun with it, then that'd be super.  I can also see that some folk who like the RP, but aren't really builders, might enjoy buying somewhere small to keep a few chests in and just have an 'address'.  And maybe folk buying something fancy for a few days for a story/roleplay/video, if they see something that would suit.  It opens up some interesting options, and should also help with how barren an area can look sometimes when a few plots close by fall vacant.  ""Treasures to find"" could be interesting too... I can see some people leaving behind books or unusual items just for fun. :)"

The reason we don't have book shelves in each district is because we don't want all of them to be based around bookshelves. They are not needed or required in anyway and now that signs are available the old reasons why people would want them are gone.  It's important to keep districts having different flavors and traits or there would be no point to keeping them different.  If bookshelves are a major part of your plot, then you should build your idea in a district that allows them."
LordsOfMinecraft,36y6xg,Rurikar,2,Sat May 23 12:51:07 2015 UTC,"I'd disagree that the reasons people want bookshelves are gone; if anything the longer people have had to get ideas there are more reasons for people to want them. Libraries, scavenger hunts, schools, event plots, community newsletter boards besides just the ability to copy books.  They let a specialty plot be useful even if the person who runs it isn't there.  We do different stuff in places that don't have them but it's no doubt they are stupidly useful.  Not having them in some places is an interesting design constraint."

I'm really bored of arguing this fact with players because this isn't really a debate. We want different districts to have different elements to them as it FORCES players to build and create in different ways that can build new themes and ideas.  I never said that the reasons people want bookshelves are gone, I said too bad you aren't getting them. If you want to have books, move to a district with books. This isn't up for debate just as much as asking for any other book in a district. I have already pushed bookshelves into multiple districts already. Over half the districts have books, what the hell is wrong with the other half just being illiterate peasants again? Why don't we give wood to every district? Why does Wizard tower get jump pads, those are great for travelling. Why does only netherward have cobwebs? Why does some districts get plants and others don't?

I'm just saying signs are a great workaround but they're not going to pacify the bookshelf-wanting masses :)   (I do find it entertaining trying to explain LOM to people that the hot button political issue is always #1 bookshelves and #2 stairs, so much so that we had a war over them)"

So I recommend replanting trees & then cutting down those trees then replanting them. You're still controlling nature as you're destroying trees at a certain age. Plus, if we had the airport international, Dwarves from other places could take a plane here to see the beauty of the Great Oak, thus granting tourism wealth if you charged a lot of money for entering Dank Donk by plane. More money means more paper able to be imported, more paper means more cards.    Not only that, but the chemicals used transform the recycled paper quickly, usually within five seconds. Paper recycling could also be a new job, as pistons can be used to push the chemicals to quicken the recycling process. Once the paper is done being processed in the first step into something called cellulose, it is transferred to another giant pot thing where it is then turned back into paper. I know that you may be a bit skeptical of the chemicals actually working, but I'm sure they will... If you read this, thanks for your time.  OOC: If the chemicals work is up to you  Edit: On an entirely different note, you could just steal everyone's books & papers from them for cards  OOC: Edit: I can't tell if what you said was OOC or IC...?"

Besides, we could have wood-burning stoves in our homes! Summer will be the perfect time to dry out all that firewood, and then we'll be able to burn it all winter long, instead of our precious coal.

LordsOfMinecraft,36q432,mahaha_amanda,12,Thu May 21 06:02:22 2015 UTC,"Welcome back to town! Nothing too crazy has been happening for those past few months due to the Lords preparing the summer update. Mainly:   The new castle has been built. It has purchasable plots and some secrets hidden inside. Spawn has gotten a makeup. There's a welcome peasant building with a bunch of books for the newcomers, and an access to the sewers with a bunch of warp pipes leading to the most important parts of Dong Dank. Ghosts aren't a thing anymore. They got buggy with the new additions to the server, so they've been removed (unless they get fixed at some point) and made illegal. Now people who die on the city will be magically resurrected and put in jail for 10 minutes. More and more elves are present on the server. Being elf is not illegal, but Lord Willakers doesn't like them. Something having to do with them being able to see through magic. The big present that was left on the middle of the lake was actually a giant ice cube, made out of the water from the stolen lake. It has melted and flooded most of the Grove and some of Brickton and Southshire. The great Oak is dying, first she was drying by lack of water in the lake and now she is rotting because she is overflooded. The lords plan on cutting her down for paper to make more tradable cards. A new country has emerged right in the middle of Dong Dank, where the west part of Southshire was. It's called Westshire, has some strict rules and follow a totalitarian system. You need a passport to access it, although the border is not well protected and is easy to get through. A flying magical purple beard named DOOM has been wandering around in Dong Dank killing peasants. Hilarity ensued.  A new god has appeared in the server. He's named Moova, he has a temple on top of Mont Delphia (that has become a volcano since then) and his followers do a lot of sacrifices. Some peasant-made events, a pirate invasion, the Vineyard Carnival, some robot and zombie apocalypse, other things i might have forgotten. The card shop has been released, but it's still in beta. The shop is in the vineyard just at the West of Mont Delphia, you can get cards for gold or S.S. stones, you can use those cards to disguise, but be careful, as they lag out the server it's possible the system might be removed and your cards be deleted, keep that in mind if you want to buy cards. And some new functionality has been added, a /hire command to let people open doors and chests on your plot, a trade system that you use by shift + right-clicking on someone and disable with /trade, a /profile command to enter information about your character and yourself, info you can get about anyone by doing /whois <username> or look on the website. A huge update is in the work for summer. Paladin vs Bandits. A paladin HQ and a black market are being built. More info on the Trello."

LordsOfMinecraft,36jeaa,Austin_Rimben,10,Tue May 19 20:49:52 2015 UTC,"The only thing I'm sad about is the fact that you wasted your time, Rob. Maybe because I wasn't online and didn't spend any of my money (I was only going to buy one pack with the SS stones I had saved up) and maybe because I didn't draw anything or didn't make a skin that you picked.    But I hope I speak for everyone when I say that we understand that it's not your fault. It's Minecraft's fault and we know you've done the best you can.    It really was a great idea though.

LordsOfMinecraft,36jeaa,oliviathecf,3,Wed May 20 00:00:07 2015 UTC,"Looks like that is referring to FPS (client-side) lag, not TPS (server-side) lag.

Im sure most of us are going to understand that gold in LoM is useless and if we cry about it would make everything more bad as it is. Anyway in my opinion these now cards that we bought could be still used like a rare items as the event items that we get on different events(oktoberfest, BBQ and such). I will personally give them to my friends in my LoM company like salaries. But we could have cards when minecraft maps arent like this or make different items look like cards or even on that game that you were thinking to make with the money you get from us buying SS stones. Anyway wasted time we cannot give you back but atleast most of the comunity is mature and wont cry about some useless game currency. Sorry for your waste of time."

Anyway, like I said, Minecraft will always be minecraft and there is only a certain amount of things you can do without cashing a server."
LordsOfMinecraft,36jeaa,SargeLouie,4,Tue May 19 22:52:41 2015 UTC,"The important thing to remember is that shit happens. Will it suck if people lose their gold? Yes. Will it be the end of the world? No. Any gold spent can be re-earned. The important part is the irl stuff (i.e. what you were saying about the thousands of dollars worth of man hours). If you don't have time/money/efforts/resources to fix it at the moment, don't. We will understand. Paladins vs. Bandits is out next month, and that will take everyone's minds off of the Card Shop until at least the end of the summer. If it is as awesome as you, Nisovin, Roamin, and the others are building it up to be, PVB will have so much stuff involved that the cards will be immaterial until you are able to fix it (if at all possible). Bottom line, don't sweat it. I doubt anyone will stop playing this amazing game because one feature had shit hit the fan. And if they do, shame on them. It shouldn't be skin off your back."
LordsOfMinecraft,36jeaa,Voltage2016,3,Tue May 19 23:30:22 2015 UTC,I know this one server that has tagged items to display a picture when hovered over. So maybe that could be a solution?

LordsOfMinecraft,36jeaa,AndrewFr1234,3,Tue May 19 22:46:10 2015 UTC,"I'm sure this has been thought of already but I'll ask anyways, is there any other object you could substitute the map for? Like maybe a name tag or a compass? or something? Just a thought. I don't really know the technical side to how this would work... I understand it's hard and I appreciate everything you do for us. Thank you for your work!"
LordsOfMinecraft,36jeaa,teddybeartyler,4,Tue May 19 23:49:13 2015 UTC,"The map is the only item that can be used for this purpose. The way the maps work is that each map image has its own file made of NBT data. Whenever you select a map (hold it in your hands), the client requests the data of the map, and then the server has to send the all the NBT data, which isn't as well compressed as a normal image file, to the client. This happens every time you look at a map because maps like to change a lot during normal gameplay. Normally on a server, you won't have many people looking at maps at one time, and people don't refresh their maps very often, so there isn't an issue with lag from them. But with the card shop, maps were used extensively as an aesthetic item, which means there might legitimately be around five hundred map updates per second. It's easy to see how that might cause the server to slow down a lot. Of course, other items can't be used to replace maps because maps are the only items that can be used to store and display a bunch of different images. While lots of items in LoM do have custom item textures, each separate item type can only have one texture. That means if we did want to use other items as cards, we would have to use lots of different items or we would have to use only one item and we wouldn't have the pretty pictures the maps give us."
LordsOfMinecraft,36jeaa,soandso2,8,Wed May 20 01:06:13 2015 UTC,"Worst case scenario: use a different item and not have the custom community-drawn images in-game.  That way transformations are still collectable, but you can still see the community artwork on the website profiles collection tab.  I know this is a possible last thing we want happening, but still better than scrapping the whole idea."
LordsOfMinecraft,36jeaa,TheBaldr01,1 point,Wed May 20 04:54:16 2015 UTC,yeah but then someone has to do all the grunt work attaching the transformations to said items. sounds like invisible tech-squire work to me.
LordsOfMinecraft,36jeaa,wanderingfalcon,1 point,Wed May 20 15:36:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought it was something like that... It was just something I thought of and afterwards was like ""Wait... only maps display pictures."" I mean if there was a way to do it, Books are kind of the same way as well... Sorta...  Edit: I'm still learning the ""technical"" side of Minecraft so sorry if it's all wrong XD"

LordsOfMinecraft,36jeaa,bayboy02,1 point,Wed May 20 11:35:55 2015 UTC,If the lag issue gets resolved a possible way to stop you having to go around and fix cards without artists:  Use one of the NCPs in the shop to sell card packs the way they do currently and have the other trade 4 or 5 cards in return for a card pack (so people can get rid of their cards without artists and also allow for people to recycle cards at a slight cost to the total number of cards they are trading).  Unsure if possible but could use the same mechanics as currently available to sell snowballs/granite/wheat etc.  Apologies as you weren't directly looking for suggestions but if it would take less man hours to code this than it would be to go around plots and manually fix cards without artists it may be worth it.  Thanks again for all your work on this Rob & all others.
LordsOfMinecraft,36jeaa,fourears,1 point,Wed May 20 14:39:10 2015 UTC,"What are the chances that it's just a matter of how many people are looking at the maps all at once? Maybe after the hype dies down, so would the lag as there wouldn't be 200 people loading a map at the same time."
LordsOfMinecraft,36jeaa,Nicci_Galanohel,3,Wed May 20 14:53:50 2015 UTC,"I have to think this would be mostly true except on, say, days when new cards come out. But, you know, minecraft. A game put together with duct tape and bubble gum. Props to Rob and Nis for putting up with it for so long; shame there's not a similar creative platform like it to use in its place. I love the aesthetic, hate the development drama.   I believe that placed maps in item frames can also be a problem; like they are in the shop, see BTC comment below. Which is kind of too bad because I would love it if artists could get their cards hung in their house :)   (except I live on a guild plot and don't really have a room of my own to put it in, which is why I sit in the Platypool at spawn all the time)."

LordsOfMinecraft,36ejp2,vK_InFaMy,10,Mon May 18 20:48:49 2015 UTC,"I'll admit, the first time you did it to me, I was confused and creeped out a bit. But after five seconds, it became clear that you were just saying ""Ello"" to everyone, and I found it quite amusing. I think it is a great thing to do, especially compared to any number of other role-plays you could have chosen, and it requires dedication. I say, do what makes you happy, and ignore those who tell you to stop.  Others have suggested messaging the people you are greeting, but I say you should keep it in local chat, as it is a form of rp and makes sense to be audible to everyone in the area. That said, maybe you should change your location so that you don't fill spawn with noise, as there is already enough chatter there. I would suggest settling in one of the market buildings, greeting only those who enter the building. Or, better yet, ask one of the area establishments like the Handlebar or the Bindstone Bar if they need a greeter, and make your current rp part of a larger rp experience. Those are just my suggestions; you may do whatever you want. :)"

The pictures are of Lords trying to dispose of swammies.   You see, some naughty peasants like to do anything to get our gracious lords's attention. One of the ways they like to do this is to throw stuff at them, which they always pick up, because the lords are amazingly nice to everyone.   At this point, they will notice a swammie in their hand. They know that they have to get rid of it. They could do this with a wave of their hand. However, they are much more clever than that. They need every peasant to see them dispose of them. That is why you can see the lords with swammies."

Perhaps we can levitate a book slightly or maybe create a small breeze, but other than that we just can't do complicated magic. Then when the black market comes out maybe we can do more. Maybe there are magical items that teach peasants more about magic, and we start to see just how truly dangerous it is. No wonder the lords would make it illegal.

LordsOfMinecraft,367q5p,Makydog,6,Sun May 17 23:36:58 2015 UTC,"Don't god mode, never ever god mode. What I mean by this is to remember that we are all peasants, nothing more. None of us are ancient troll kings or powerful grand wizards from Camelot, we are peasants. You say you RP with magic, as Cole said, peasants technically can't do magic yet. Once we can, remember that your powers are limited to what is available in the shop, so you couldn't go, ""I have a spell that will level the city and resurrect Barsiddius!"" because that would be unreasonable.  And as Josh said, god moding makes RP unfun for the other people participating, so be very careful with that."

LordsOfMinecraft,35w3ve,TheBaldr01,1 point,Sat May 16 18:06:19 2015 UTC,"Main Street:       Main Street is the metonym for a generic street name (and often the official name) of the primary retail street of a village, town or small city in many parts of the world. It is usually a focal point for shops and retailers in the central business district, and is most often used in reference to retailing and socializing. The street running parallel to a town's numbered streets, before First Street, may be Main Street.  The term is commonly used in Ireland, Scotland and the United States, and less often in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In most of the United Kingdom the common description is High Street. However, the term ""Main Street"" is sometimes used in the UK, for instance, in the village of Sutton Cheney. In Jamaica the term is Front Street. In some parts of the south west of England the equivalent used is Fore Street.  In some larger cities, there may be several Main Streets, each relating to a specific neighborhood or formerly separate city, rather than the city as a whole. In many larger U.S. cities ""Main Street"" is a U.S. Highway; ""Main Street of America"" branding was used to promote U.S. Route 66 in its heyday.

LordsOfMinecraft,35tccw,Rurikar,8,Wed May 13 20:05:13 2015 UTC,It's not really a game though. It's more of a chat client then anything else. Lord's exists for the purpose of creating a world to let Youtubers make videos of and interact with fans.
LordsOfMinecraft,35tccw,VulkanHesstan,5,Wed May 13 21:37:42 2015 UTC,Well the reason for the ten minute jailing upon death is because of people that notice the lords trying to do a video and getting in the way/spamming potions or food/trying to sneak into the video just so they can say that they were there. Rob finally got sick of it and had to make a solution that meant he could make a video without the rude interruptions from people who just immediately came back and continued where they left off
LordsOfMinecraft,35tccw,firebolt8900,1 point,Wed May 13 14:05:08 2015 UTC,This is what Lord Aura was made for. The jail time for Lord Aura should be at least 10 minutes.
LordsOfMinecraft,35tccw,Rurikar,2,Wed May 13 20:20:02 2015 UTC,"Lord aura is for keeping everyone away. Sometimes lords want to be surrounded by the community, but still want to be able to get rid of trouble makers."
LordsOfMinecraft,35tccw,Tipper213,6,Thu May 14 02:27:30 2015 UTC,"Whipping people is a pain in the ass, even more so when people turn it into a game by trying to run around on people's plots to annoy them. 5 minutes is an insanely short time already and if someone whips you in a way you don't like, just don't go to their plot anymore. The reason why bounce whips jail over doing something you described is because sometimes people just need a time out.   in my opinion the ""dying is illegal"" reason is just a crutch because there needs to be a consequence for death   Duh. When we kill players we don't want them coming back for awhile as it gets in the way of RP and making videos. We kept having the problem where we would kill players, only to have them come back time and time again not ""getting it"". Much easier to just have them sit in time out for 10 mins and honestly outside of Lords killing you, it's super rare to get yourself killed unless on purpose.  I think it's important you remember the purpose of this server and that's to make youtube videos and interact with fans. You are expecting this to be some big ol harvest moon game and that's just not what it's going to be while it's in minecraft. You are very much a guest who is here to join the RP, meet/talk/rp with other fans, and help us make very unique content."
LordsOfMinecraft,35tccw,Rurikar,9,Wed May 13 21:43:50 2015 UTC,"I think it's important you remember the purpose of this server and that's to make youtube videos and interact with fans.    Sorry if I misunderstood the way this sentence was written, because from the quote, it sounds like the purpose of the server is for lords to make videos and interact with their fanbase; if I'm wrong about that, disregard the next question.  What is the purpose of the server during the majority of the time when there aren't youtube videos being made or interactions with fans?"
LordsOfMinecraft,35tccw,Tipper213,5,Wed May 13 22:30:55 2015 UTC,"Simple roleplay. I mean, don't get me wrong, there are things you can do that are gamelike on Lords and with things like the Paladin and Bandits it may have more a game feel, but the server is of a type of entertainment that doesn't really exist. It's a world presented in videos that anyone can join and add too that people play make believe. A 1000 people play Lord's regularly whereas 25,000 watch it.  Roleplay is such a foreign concept to so many people that they can not understand why they would even want to log into a world where there is nothing to ""do"" when the truth is you can do whatever you want via roleplay and what you're really looking for is a world or atmosphere that you can play make believe in.  I appreciate idea threads, but while Lords is in Minecraft, we don't really stride to turn it into a game because of the limitations in what we would want to do."
LordsOfMinecraft,35tccw,Rurikar,4,Thu May 14 00:13:58 2015 UTC,"I appreciate idea threads, but while Lords is in Minecraft, we don't really stride to turn it into a game because of the limitations in what we would want to do.   It makes a lot of sense to say that, since Minecraft is understandably a hard game to modify; but that shouldn't be an excuse to ignore some, relatively speaking, simple ideas to flesh out the server that currently exists.  Some ideas suggested as to what to do while you're in jail are incredibly simple and would help make jail a much more bearable experience.  At the moment, the jail is almost always empty so there isn't an opportunity for people to roleplay while in jail. And a simple parkour or maze was suggested in order to act as some sort of distraction while you wait to be released.   Sure, this idea, if implemented, will take away from the time-out corner feel of jail; but that is because the system as a whole is flawed.  I would argue that jail is flawed because it combines both the punishment for annoying lords, and the punishment for dying through RP.   A simple way to fix this would be to separate these punishments into their own ways of dealing with them.   For example: If you were killed by a lord while the server was in recording mode, you could simply be kicked from the server for a certain amount of time. While if you died from something else you would be sent to a more hospitable jail, where you could serve your sentence and still enjoy the server."
LordsOfMinecraft,35tccw,Tipper213,4,Thu May 14 00:38:07 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand. Me and Nisovin often do not pick the option we think is best, but easiest to implement. That's the point I was trying to get across. The reason whips work the way they do is because we already had the system in place for lords. This isn't to say we are lazy, but that we have other projects we are working on that we don't few this as important enough to drastically overhaul to make it the best system possible.  When we said we were done working on Minecraft minigames almost this time last year, we meant it, and so implementing and changing new features is about time efficiency, not what's best for design. Most suggestions made here require a fundamentally rework in order to implement because this server is not just built on our plugins, but the ones of others and we can't exactly change that. The suggestions you just offered are not something we can implemented without a major time investment.  So if you don't always understand why I shoot things down, understand that there is always this additional part of ""This would take too much time and/or upkeep to maintain in the future"". If Lords isn't fundamentally simple to update and maintain next time Mojang releases a major update, we would more likely stop updating it which would put a death clock on the server. You just told me you think it be a good idea to make a whole other separate system for RP deaths compared to the Lord's system because you few it as flawed (which again I don't) and all I see is a couple hours of rework that neither of has the time to do anyway.   The fact is, there are plenty of things we would improve if Lords if we had the time, but we pick and choose what to work on that we feel is more important. I bet you instead of the summer paladin/bandit update, I could have reworked all the current systems/jobs we already have to improve them, but that's a lot less important to the general player base then just adding more content and making more videos."

LordsOfMinecraft,35tccw,Tipper213,3,Thu May 14 05:28:03 2015 UTC,"Hiring another hand takes money. He's already paying Haunter to edit videos (yer paying him, right Rob? Or is he just an intern of sorts?), and he has to eat and pay rent/taxes just like the rest of us. On top of that, I'm sure there's some money being stored away to pay for the Urealms game to be made. And let's not forgot server hosting fees, although I believe they pay for themselves at this point.  Suffice to say, hiring on a programmer would take away from all of that."
LordsOfMinecraft,35tccw,Negnar_Holf,2,Thu May 14 05:33:39 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's a logical progression for a company to expand when all it's employees are working at their maximum and they still can't find enough time to do all the things they wish to do."

You save up what you can and then invest it at the correct time to maximize profit. Rob COULD hire on a new developer to assist with LoM and DvZ, but there would be little profit from it. A satisfied community but empty pockets is not a win/win situation.  Now, lets say Rob saves up that money and instead spends it on hiring a few programmers to assist with the release of the Urealms game. For starters, he restores his honor and good name to the community. He can also SELL the game for profit, thus raking in more money to spend on bigger projects. I'm not saying that's what's happening here, of course. I'm just giving a little insight as to how I see the situation.  An investment at a bad time on the wrong thing can break a person. An investment at a good time on the wrong thing can break a person. An investment at a bad time on a good thing can break a person. An investment at a good time on a good thing is the key to success."

But now that I've re-read my question, I see where I said something that might be taken as something else, and I'm going to edit my original question accordingly."
LordsOfMinecraft,35tccw,Qu33nAce,1 point,Thu May 14 05:54:58 2015 UTC,"According to when I had Kyle on my podcast a while back, Haunter started out as a ""paid per video"" but because he took over a number of other duties for Buffalo Wizards, he became a ""monthly salary"" employee to Rob.    I think the point you're trying to make is this: Hiring a decent programmer who knows what they're doing and we'll consider entry level would cost about between $45,000 to $50,000 a year. That is bare bones, and I'm guessing the average programmer makes more than that.    I don't know what Rob's financial situation is, but that alone would be a HUGE money investment, for a game that has such limitations on what can be done.    I understand what's being done here. For the best interest, sometimes the best option sucks. When it comes to business, if your current audience is 1,000 people and 950 of those people are happy, you're doing well. Nothing will be perfect, and nothing will please all the masses. Unfortunately. That's just my 2 cents."

LordsOfMinecraft,35ntid,SlikThePeasant,6,Tue May 12 00:50:45 2015 UTC,"One of the rules on the server is ""Do not post links in chat"". Exceptions can't be made to rules like this, otherwise everyone starts to come up with reasons as to why they should be allowed to post them up. Whatever system you create, you'll have to keep in mind that you won't be able to link it in chat.  I would personally just recommend using a PlugDJ like everyone else on the server does for this sort of thing."
LordsOfMinecraft,35ntid,Negnar_Holf,2,Tue May 12 01:09:33 2015 UTC,I think we could make an exception to this rule for signs though to advertise things like this. Signs are very easy to report if someone abuses them and aren't in your face like chat advertising would be.
LordsOfMinecraft,35ntid,Rurikar,5,Tue May 12 22:56:27 2015 UTC,"Aye, I have nothing against signs with links on them. Books are also a good way to share a link as well. It's just when the chat begins filling up with them is when I think it becomes a problem.  However, I don't think using Signs is a good solution for what this person is proposing, since they cost so much and are unlikely to be seen by the population as a whole (considering they can only be posted on a plot said person owns).  It's a good idea in theory, but unless they get some Lordly recognition, it's unlikely to kick off."
LordsOfMinecraft,35ntid,Negnar_Holf,1 point,Tue May 12 23:12:56 2015 UTC,You could do plug.dj. Unless you want to keep it completely in-game.
LordsOfMinecraft,35ntid,Voltage2016,1 point,Tue May 12 01:09:30 2015 UTC,Plug.DJ could work especially of we get the link posted at spawn and at like a central radio station I feel that would be an awesome rp experience
LordsOfMinecraft,35ntid,fanzel123,6,Tue May 12 05:02:30 2015 UTC,"I'd think you'd have a hard time convincing Nisovin that yer radio is relevant enough to be posted directly at spawn, but I do wish you the best of luck with it."
LordsOfMinecraft,35ntid,Negnar_Holf,1 point,Tue May 12 05:04:16 2015 UTC,"The one problem I see with a plug.dj radio station is that Jimmies would join the dj list. So instead of Jimmies tuning in to listen to music, they would pick their own music. Of course, that's also what bouncers are for..."
LordsOfMinecraft,35ntid,Cronurd,4,Tue May 12 05:04:48 2015 UTC,You can lock waitlists which stops other people joining and playing their songs. My experience with plugdj is that if you make the list public and want to keep the music to a specific theme you need moderators to skip sings that dont make sense and/or are just troll songs

LordsOfMinecraft,35k9dm,Jalbot,19,Mon May 11 04:14:58 2015 UTC,"Don't use bouncewhips. They are mean't to be used if somebody is abusing or is getting annoyed on your plot.   Incorrect, they are an RP tool. If someone is using one on you multiple times, you shouldn't bother going to their plot anymore if that's a problem for you.   Don't create a RP where you are bunkered down and fighting for your life if you won't let people try to break in, it is as if you create a party and only invite yourself.   You don't have to make an RP that allows everyone on the server to jump in. Generally speaking, it's best to include others around you, but you don't have too. If people don't want you as part of their RP, they can tell you to be left alone in ooc or again use the bounce whip.   Don't GodRP, but on top of that, if you don't know the guy your fighting don't GodRP on purpose just to laugh, because while you are laughing the other person is getting really annoyed, and was serious about that fight.   If you find yourself being personally ""annoyed"" or upset in any way on the server, either go somewhere else or take a break from the server. Sometimes people want to play in a small group of friends and they don't want to include every single person in their reindeer games, so instead of throwing a fit and taking things too serious yourself, go find some new reindeer to play with.  Please don't speak on behalf of people anymore. Your personally ideals do not align with the servers. This server is a public RP server, but it's silly to expect everyone to get along with everyone else. If someone is harassing you, feel free to report them, but do not feel so entitled that everyone has to play with you. Our server has many a people who are patient and welcoming of new people, but at the same time we have a ton of immaturity and youth that can be pretty childish to deal with from time to time. It's best to be realistic about it and understand that not everyone can be friends with each other, but they can at least be civil and from the problems you listed it sounds like you wanted to be part of some RP, they didn't want you, and you got frustrated/annoyed instead of just going somewhere else."
LordsOfMinecraft,35k9dm,Rurikar,2,Mon May 11 17:41:33 2015 UTC,"I agree Rob. Not everyone wants to follow what jalbot does. They can rp however they want, rping is ment to have fun in your own fantasy is how I see it."

LordsOfMinecraft,35k9dm,Kaminari_Seishin,1 point,Mon May 11 18:19:26 2015 UTC,"Rob, I was wondering what your opinion and possibly the servers as a whole on using such things as anvils and burning tools to kill people in RP moments without the other players consent?"
LordsOfMinecraft,35k9dm,Rurikar,6,Mon May 11 19:23:54 2015 UTC,"Death really isn't a big deal. You can report people as if a single player is purposely going around being a dick under the guise of roleplay, we knock sense into them or outright ban them. Fundamentally you have to be on a plot they have access too which already means you are vulnerable to jail whips and such, so that really is the consent.   The reason we always stress reports is because then it gives us a log both ways. It shows us players who are fussy and report everything so we know to not really to trust them blindly and reports of players who generally go around upsetting other players. Telling people to ""submit a report"" builds us a log on user behavior that is voluntarily submitted. Your average user is really only going to report someone if they cross the line and having a back log of history of all parties involved is super important for understanding the player base and the issues with interactions they have."

This isn't true at all, when bounce whips were first added to the server we were told to use them in any way we wish. That Bounce Whip ""Abuse"" didn't exist. If we want to just sit there and bounce whip anyone who comes on our plot we can.   Don't create a RP where you are bunkered down and fighting for your life if you won't let people try to break in, it is as if you create a party and only invite yourself.   Are you saying if we have a blocked off area in a plot we MUST let people break in there? That area is private for a reason, we don't want anyone in there. Unless you have to consent of the plot owner it's just abusing a glitch on the server to get to a place you think may be cool."
LordsOfMinecraft,35k9dm,McENEN,2,Mon May 11 10:30:10 2015 UTC,"I agree, and for private areas you are supposed to make it hard to get in,  if you make it easy every body will get in."
LordsOfMinecraft,35k9dm,teddybeartyler,2,Mon May 11 10:36:24 2015 UTC,"Not even that, the fact that if someone has a trap door somewhere, and it's closed, it probably means they don't want anyone there and you shouldn't try to get in there."
LordsOfMinecraft,35k9dm,McENEN,2,Mon May 11 10:38:53 2015 UTC,true but you should build something for your secrets just hide them. In my old house I made a room with a secret book case with my secrets and if anyone ever tried o brake in it would be interesting for him.

I was created by Coebot, as many other robots here are. I can turn people into bots, too, using the transformation room at the robot cult <3  I'm definitely able to use magic - it's somewhat built into us, but I'm kiiinda 'corrupted' because my silly little brat of a roommate who won't let me slice her open to make her just like me cat roomie let her dark magic loose, so I can play with it more than most now <3  -x-  Coebot:  I am a full robot. I have never been 'alive'. I serve as a command/help bot :)  I come from the Land of Twitch and was created through a series of experiments on artificial intelligence and robotics (thus, I'm entirely artificial). When I came to Dong Dank, I was added to by Lord Nisovin, apparently. I did not know this until the castle competition, when Lord Willakers referred to myself as one of his creations.  Most robots in Dong Dank, if they are affliated with myself (usually shown with silver skin and hair, red eyes and cyan/red clothing and facial features), were created either by myself, Vetbot, or Hanbot. Robots are a self-sustaining race who can either be constructed or transformed from other living beings including elves, hobbits and dwarves.  My brand of robotics is not the sole type of mechanical being around; you will find others who look different, have different creation stories and are not affiliated with myself at all.  Of magic: I apparently have some ability for it, as do most bots of my typing as some magic items are used in the creation of us. However, I do not currently use any. I prefer science and commands :) Interestingly, this makes robots susceptible to magic-based infections like taint. At some point I want to do a test to see if magic-resistant beings such as elves (as found out when curing myself of taint, elves are not affected by it) maintain this resistance as robots."

When I was born, wild magic was instantly taken in by my body, and it flows through my veins like blood. I know of no other born like this, and if they exist, they most likely manifest a form quite diffrent from my own. As for if I am able to use magic, I have only seen ambient occurences around me, such as self-resurrection and metal melding with my own flesh, but never have these acts been initated by myself.

I was once a grandfather clock made from an old oak tree, then abruptly, I gained sentience and started to grow like the tree I once was. Well my primary physical form is in this appearance anyways. Occasionally I take on the persona of some one else, if the need arises.  My creation is a mystery to myself and the answers to my own past have eluded me. As far as I am aware I was manifested for the sole purpose of carrying on the title of Stopwatcher.   With this title comes a great power, a power that allows myself to wield wondrous time distorting magic. Although these powers come naturally to me I need an amplifier to truly use them to their full extent. Without said amplifier the most I can do is regenerate my physical form when it gets destroyed. Currently my amplifier, an old wooden staff, has managed to fall out of my hands and has ended up some where in the walls, or possibly outside of the walls, of Dong Dank.

LordsOfMinecraft,3505j9,bayboy02,14,Wed May 6 00:25:14 2015 UTC,"So I was doing some calculations.  Rob listed the chances of getting epic, rares, and commons.  I just averaged and rounded to find the chances to get the rounded average of each rarity.  So the card distribution is going to be 2% for Epics, 18% for Rares, and 80% for commons. Again this is rounded for easier numbers and RNG going to make these numbers off a bit too.    With these numbers we can determine that Rares are going to be 4.4x less rarity than common cards, and Epic are going to be 40x less rarity than common cards.    So all we need now is the value of a common card.  With out rarity, you just divide the 500 gold by the 3 cards. About 167 gold per card.  A common card is going to be worth much less than that because of the inflated value of the rare and epic cards.    This is where I my statistics knowledge ends, as I don't have a logical way of coming up with a good number of what commons should be worth, so I just going to say between 50-100 gold.  It probably as low as 32 gold.     At 50-100 gold for commons: 220-440 gold for rares 2000-4000 gold for epics    This doesn't count for variables such as the number of individual common, rare, and epic cards, nor people's preferences for certain cards, which drives up demands for those individual cards.    Bottom line the main factor for price is Demand."
LordsOfMinecraft,3505j9,TheBaldr01,8,Wed May 6 01:17:30 2015 UTC,You have to account for supply and demand as well. Mr Monocles lets players turn into a cat which will most likely make it the most expensive rare.  The other commons that turn you into mobs will also be used a lot. Popular cards that people use for roleplay will also have more value.
LordsOfMinecraft,3505j9,Rurikar,2,Wed May 6 04:17:28 2015 UTC,"So what you mean is, the swammie card will be more popular than something like justin, because you are turned into a different mob. Also, I'm sooooo hyped about the release of the card shop for some reason! I got 300 SS stones so I could get some packs of cards :D"

LordsOfMinecraft,3505j9,TheBaldr01,6,Wed May 6 01:25:55 2015 UTC,"Baldr was right in the ball park with his calculations. What I did with mine was figure out the probability of the cards, found the value of 50 cards and then splitting that value evenly between all the rarity groups (1 card being epic, 9 being rare and 40 being common). Which works out at about 70 gold for the commons, 300 for the rares and around 2700 for the Epics (If you want me to explain my process a bit better I will).  Again these prices will definitely be heavily inflated by demand. These should only serve as a minimum."
LordsOfMinecraft,3505j9,Kohtalon_,2,Wed May 6 01:30:48 2015 UTC,"I'll use these numbers as a minimum, and baldr's highest numbers and I'll let the customer decide how much he/she thinks a card is worth when buying it."
LordsOfMinecraft,3505j9,Rurikar,2,Wed May 6 01:52:47 2015 UTC,"Ahh thanks, that makes sense, I knew I had to get collection of cards to find the value, but couldn't exactly get my head around it."
LordsOfMinecraft,3505j9,Kohtalon_,4,Wed May 6 03:05:49 2015 UTC,"Whilst I agree with the rough math of both Baldr and THStheThird (at the base rate of 500 per pack anyway), this 'value' assumes that cards will be able to be traded for gold, and not be restricted to card for card trades only. Although there is technically nothing stopping people from trading low value cards and then 'donating' the gold value - but this effectively means you can turn $10>100 stones>60 cards>10,000 gold (yes that is correct conversion) which is kinda borderline with the user agreement, or maybe a loophole I don't know, I'm not a lawyer.   Either way, I hope it doesn't turn into a situation of 'this is why we can't have nice things'. (personally I would prefer them to be bought with gold only to avoid confusion, and then inflation/demand would sort itself out, but I know that doesn't help the server)"
LordsOfMinecraft,3505j9,hazeuk1994,13,Wed May 6 01:54:17 2015 UTC,"Card for card trades don't stop prevent from trading gold... it just means you would give someone gold and trade a crappy common for a good card.  This isn't against the eula and if it was something Mojang didn't like and told us to stop (either by changing the eula or directly), it would only suck for players because then we would disable the trading of cards or worse, just remove the system entirely. I can only sell so many hats and you guys can buy so many, I don't like the idea that I need to have to get NEW customers to buy old stuff instead of making NEW stuff to sell to old dedicated players.  I believe that if we wanted too, we COULD sell gold to work with the Eula, the only reason we don't is because of user perspective, not legality. Mojang did a great job last year proclaiming that there changes to the eula were better for the player base when all they really did was restrict server owners who wish to abide by their rules and still do nothing about the servers who break them. Lots of threats were made, but this shit is still rampant with zero enforcement.   But me and Nisovin do want to respect the wishes of Mojang and will abide by their rules on our servers. This is why the big new DvZ update has nothing in it that affects gameplay that can be purchased. You may think that is a good thing, but we had already shown on PMC that it could be done right and without being greedy, it's just a shame because the servers that abuse this shit didn't even change their stores and all the big ones changed and suffered for it."

LordsOfMinecraft,34zm87,bayboy02,7,Tue May 5 21:45:18 2015 UTC,that goes against the EULA i think because its using money to buy in game items that can change stuff because of economy
LordsOfMinecraft,34zm87,RoyalCleanerBeaver,9,Tue May 5 21:51:11 2015 UTC,"It's not technically against the EULA or rather we could make it work within the guide lines of the EULA had we wanted too. We didn't though because of the perception.  We had thought of the idea of making it so owning a plot was free and the blocks were free and gold was PURELY only used as a cosmetic in game item for roleplay. (Used for RP trades of items/services and such). And players were just required to play every so often to maintain the plot (much like you do now). But users perceptions of us selling gold would look bad to you guys, so we didn't.  Even though Mojang doesn't enforce the EULA, me and Nisovin do want to respect what it represents and the feelings behind what it was suppose to accomplish, which is why we don't build new minecraft minigames or servers anymore. We just maintain and update the ones we have. If Mojang tomorrow decided no server can make money or accept money for any reason tomorrow, we would shut down DvZ and reduce Lords to something we could cover the costs out of pockets so we can still do it for Youtube."

LordsOfMinecraft,34uqqb,wanderingfalcon,7,Mon May 4 19:19:06 2015 UTC,We haven't finished the first cycle (year) of the graph yet. I wouldn't start making any projections until we have at least one cycle of data.
LordsOfMinecraft,34uqqb,firebolt8900,8,Mon May 4 19:11:09 2015 UTC,People are busy when it's not summer.
LordsOfMinecraft,34uqqb,ColeQM,3,Mon May 4 19:13:22 2015 UTC,I know. But still. I'm just making observations
LordsOfMinecraft,34uqqb,Rurikar,3,Mon May 4 19:16:44 2015 UTC,Your comparing months of extreme activity with months of mild activity which makes your observations worth a lot less. You are drawing your own conclusions using data that you don't have enough of to draw said conclusions. You can pretty much look at any community anywhere and see the exact same issues with traffic. The few months of every year are always like this.
LordsOfMinecraft,34uqqb,labtec901,2,Mon May 11 20:35:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying whether I think it's good or bad, I'm ""Just making observations"""
LordsOfMinecraft,34uqqb,istisp,1 point,Mon May 11 21:05:49 2015 UTC,I once tried something similar.  I thought my graphs would protect me.  I was wrong.
LordsOfMinecraft,34uqqb,FractumHorologium,4,Wed May 13 12:00:57 2015 UTC,"The data you collected is awesome, really, but the projection for the rest of the year doesn't make any sense. First, unless you have enough data to deduce a chronic trend, you can't make precise estimations of the future. The server has been out there for 9 months, we have no idea how its popularity usually evolves between April and July, and even if we had, we would need at least a few years of data to establish a trend.  Second, and most importantly, the estimation of what will happen during the summer is the opposite of what will actually happen! There's a huge update in the making that will be released during this period, and that has been hyped for a few months already. Rob also announced that the lords will release way more videos than they currently do during this period, he even said he would personally release at least one video a day. There's no way the popularity of the server will be lower on July/August than on April when all the advertising and the new features will happen there.  The decline of popularity the server has been going through is kind of a shame but is normal and to be expected. Players are currently busy with school and work. Rob and Nis are currently busy coding the summer update for lords and DvZ and have barely released any videos on the meanwhile. The other Lords are busy with other stuff, most of them aren't full time youtubers, in fact I think only Roamin and Kyle have been around recently.  The server is centered around lord interaction, it's intended to produce youtube videos and the youtubers are their main/only source of advertisement. It's just normal that the popularity has dropped. And it's on purpose too, like I said, everyone, lords/youtubers and peasants/watchers are too busy on this period to play and watch/make videos, the server has voluntarily been put on life support on the meanwhile, in order to make something great when the most people will be able to enjoy it. The drop of popularity is perfectly normal, I agree it's a little sad but it will not keep going on and we'll get a massive increase of people during the summer, I can guarantee it.  Don't get me wrong, I really like this post. the data you collected are really nice. For the projection part though, I think it can be safely ignored, as it won't happen that way. Does it mean we don't need to inspire people? Of course not, it's always great to inspire people and make the server a lively place. But as regular players, there's not a lot we can do to get more players there except advertise it to our friends, and even though they wouldn't enjoy the server at its fullest since the server is kind of dead at the moment. The conclusion? We can and should inspire people. But don't you worry jimmy, we only need to wait :)"
LordsOfMinecraft,34uqqb,TinyLongwing,3,Tue May 5 07:39:22 2015 UTC,"For students (like me): Finals, APs, part-time, etc. Its not the lack of inspiration, but more of the lack of time."
LordsOfMinecraft,34uqqb,Boolderdash,2,Mon May 4 21:52:00 2015 UTC,"Conclusion: We need to inspire the people!   That's exactly what the summer update will do. There's a bit of a lull in the youtube videos and new content right now while they plan for summer. Rest assured, very cool new things are coming in the next couple months that will revitalize the community."

LordsOfMinecraft,34q9mi,CultTheBear,2,Mon May 4 15:32:12 2015 UTC,"We'll just have to wait. Unless Rob and Niso believe that the numbers well actually stay high, it simply wouldn't be good economically to spend on expanding a server temporarily.  Mineplex relies upon their subscription, a reoccurring regular source of income they can attempt to predict to some degree of reliability and continuity. This regular income allows them to say hmm ok we know we can afford this much. If people spend on other extra's we can get this much. We have a mega ton of data to help us with these predictions. Yeah they have lifetime packs, but well since the primary market is a younger audience the subscription is really what the younger audience can afford despite lifetime being better. On the whole young people aren't great at saving up and waiting if we are all honest, hell most people aren't.  LoM income is what S.S Stones. Which can be spent on a few bits and bobs here and there. Nice bits and bobs but still few and only little nice additions to add to RP. If your not an RP person these items aren't well that valuable as should be the case of course in a RP server. So unlike Mineplex which is cosmetics and ""show off"" items i.e. mounts and permanent  morphs (different to our cardshop morphs given you have to choose between keeping the cards or morphing with them, least from what I last read, honestly haven't been keeping up with LoM to much). I wouldn't think people who don't already own a plot of their own or friends and who aren't great fans of RP well be spending on stuff for LoM. Yeah some extra bits here and there but not sure it would justify expanding the server given the costs it would have. Even more so since LoM and DvZ have never been for profit so doesn't have much focused on ""earning"" money because its not for money so limited desirability to spend due to limited options as well.  If say numbers stayed high and didn't drop down it might get expanded but well its no use putting all the time, effort and money into expanding the server just so that once the initial ""omg look at this omg omg mineplex used something from here lets run to here and omg look its a building"" dies off for the server to return to normal, and then have to go to more time and effort into downsizing the server just to not keep paying extra costs that may or may not have been covered.  Its a large risk for a not for profit server to expand itself. Especially a niche server like LoM. How many people who regularly visit mineplex are into RP instead of say spending that same time doing minigames as they already do."

LordsOfMinecraft,34kq0i,_Han,2,Sat May 2 18:45:53 2015 UTC,So what you are saying you hope it sells out cause you would be making a profit?
LordsOfMinecraft,34kq0i,770squad,6,Sat May 2 09:14:38 2015 UTC,"And, to be fair, lotteries IRL also make a profit.   When you see ads like ""State Lotteries Contributed Millions to Schools"" the money comes from a portion of those profits."
LordsOfMinecraft,34kq0i,_Han,2,Sat May 2 18:58:51 2015 UTC,"Actually I never said that at all. I put the ticket limit in there because people like it because it keeps their chances of winning stable. It isn't about the gold, and if I don't sell out the tickets then that is fine by me. I have enough gold as is, and I did a limit of 300 because it is a fairly large, round number that is close to the ticket sales needed to raise the prize. I didn't make the limit 400 or 500 because that is really greedy on my part. If I do sell out the raffle, I will have only made 22 bars on my part anyway, so the profit is negligible anyway."

LordsOfMinecraft,34kq0i,McENEN,1 point,Sun May 3 00:01:29 2015 UTC,He does get. I remember at on of his raffles he told me he got 2 diamonds profit. And also he scamed someone for a stamina potion(with screen shoted). So I would suggest to get in his raffle. Not going to let my friends scamed.
LordsOfMinecraft,34kq0i,McENEN,6,Sat May 2 14:33:50 2015 UTC,"What is this ""get""? I remember that raffle where I made 2 diamonds in profit and because of that added in almost another diamond in prizes on top of what I had already done! Besides, if I went to the effort of selling all those tickets then I do deserve some profit. Kinda like restaurant owners making gold off their customers.   McENEN, I haven't scammed anyone since the very early days in Lords, which I did only a few times as a roleplay style and actually felt bad about. That screenshot, which I went over a while ago was not even proving anything. All it said was the guy saying ""you scammed me"" and me saying ""scamming isn't illegal."" It isn't like I said I actually scammed the guy. Besides the guy went on to make a phony story about the whole thing, exaggerating details, and said I scammed him 40 bars. I remember the day. I sold the guy an overpriced bruce juice or some other willy brew drink and he got mad at me for that.   Can you please stop bringing up past drama? I don't scam anyone and am happily doing raffles again now. I am not going to scam anyone and currently have a lot of friends in the trading business. Hell I just wrote an entire section on my book why scamming is bad. I have lots of friends in lords, a current ""trusted trader"" status in the trading reddit and you think I am going to forsake it all for just a raffle?"

You are free to edit it and encouraged to complete it. Just keep in mind that this wiki is meant to feature the official lore only, what I mean is that only the events featured in a lord video are considered canon to the Lords of Minecraft series. Player shenanigans, personal pages, player-made events without lord interaction or anything that has happened on the server but never got featured in a lord video are to be avoided or put in a different place.  From what I understood you want to feature community lore that would not be so official. In that case a subreddit is a fine place for that. But the wiki needs to be completed nonetheless, and there's still a lot to add, that's where people should focus their efforts before putting in community content that could always be debatable."

LordsOfMinecraft,34b4ji,fanzel123,2,Thu Apr 30 03:57:26 2015 UTC,"Many districts have banners they use to represent themselves, Westshire would just be the first to have it exist on the server. (Pure dark grey right?)"

LordsOfMinecraft,347yv6,Kavlo,4,Wed Apr 29 09:30:37 2015 UTC,Speak for yourself nerd.
LordsOfMinecraft,347yv6,TheeLemon,8,Wed Apr 29 15:36:43 2015 UTC,"This was a long time ago, during mystical times (it's been one year now). Far before those lands even came to existence. Once there was nothing but a simple pigman named Zistew with a little too much power in his hooves. Out of boredom he created a new world to play with that he called Calamity Town. Soon the inhabitants of Calamity Town discovered that this place was full of secrets, one of them was a small underhang that was quite hard to reach but was a nice place to hang out, thing that quite amused the pigman, surprised to see so many people celebrating such a meaningless little place.  Everything was good, until an old man in a penguin suit appeared. Following the orders of his divinity, Jayfool, he sealed the Underhang and locked everyone who was in. Fortunately, Zistew released them, and generously rebuilt a better underhang that was significantly harder to reach. He charged us to defend this place and to keep the secret about it. This is how the order of [Redacted] was created, redacted as in the rule that forbid them to talk about that place.  Unfortunately, the old man didn't admit his defeat. He came back and made this place public and easier to access to. Soon it became swarmed with the followers of Jayfool, and the old man, foolishly thinking he had won, took refuge in a cursed place, the Temple of Jayfool.  But [Redacted] seeked revenge. They followed the old man to his own kingdom and confronted him. While the followers of Jayfool slowly abandoned him, [Redacted] stayed, and at the rate of one block every 20 seconds, they slowly built an entire city to shadow Jayfool's influence, an oasis of order in a land where chaos ruled. Jayfool kept losing his influence, and feeling his power fade away, tried to destroy the entire city in a final blow that he didn't know would cause his ultimate demise.  The power he released was too important. The false divinity, that had already been weakened, died while releasing what was left of his power, in a blast that blew up his own temple. The city of [Redacted] was partially damaged too, but not enough to not be repaired in a day. Ironically, the giant [R] marking the entrance of the city, that Jayfool was trying to destroy, was still standing strong and proud right after the event happened.  But alongside the damage it caused to the city, the blast left a way more insidious, way more dangerous mark. The inhabitants of the [R] city were all touched by the energy of the fallen god of Chaos. Some of them even saw the divinity in its own eyes as it expired its last breath. But such a burst of insanity, such a ray of chaos, didn't let their minds unaltered. It let a small mark in their minds that couldn't be removed. And is slowly driving them insane without any way to fight it.  Jayfool being vainquished, the mission of [Redacted] was accomplished. The city dying and the world crumbling, they were banned from these realms with no come back. They retired in the realms of Lord of Minecraft, a world where Jayfool, killed by Efo who was killed by Jayfool, never had any influence. Or did they think, since rumors are talking about the old man still being alive and even living in this very own city, not even remembering that he was once the prophet of Jayfool and still has the potential of bringing Jayfool back to life.  They decided to live a normal life in Dank Dong. They even built a sewage plant to contribute to the city life. Although that might be what they want you to think, as those guys became more and more insane, they now only want to cause chaos and evil, and they seem for some reason to think that they can use some wonky contraption involving poop and carrots to open a portal back to their hometown, Calamity Town.  So, young man, you're wondering what [Redacted] is? It is an group of slightly insane people who vainquished a divinity in his own land with his own weapons. So behold, for their name is known and feared in realms that are even beyond the reach of the Lords of Minecraft!"

LordsOfMinecraft,347yv6,TheeLemon,6,Thu Apr 30 04:11:04 2015 UTC,It's a group of friends who build stuff and hang out together and do events. There are a lot of gifted builders and skinners in it. I'm biased saying I like them but some other people don't due to some controversy over plots and various other reasons. I think you can only get in if they ask you or if you befriend them to a point where you can ask them. They're base is the guild plot in Westshire if you want to check them out. They might also still have a subreddit if thats still a thing though I can't find it.
LordsOfMinecraft,347yv6,Phireflyer,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:56:03 2015 UTC,I don't think they ever had a subreddit.

LordsOfMinecraft,347yv6,fanzel123,6,Wed Apr 29 21:06:12 2015 UTC,"[R] is a closed group of friends who love to mess around with each other and do silly role play things on Lords, they started off at calamity town and then did something with Temple of Jarool where Rob was circlejerking pretty much and everyone had a wonderful time, now those times are gone and we are left with Lords which is still an amazing server but everyone would love to have jarool up in here :D.   we used to use a skype group chat but we have gone onto Teamspeak now which can be  better at times, we have a guild plot in West Shire and a sewage plant in Magic Quarter, we love to do events as it is super fun. Also if you ever see us saying something like ""who likes toast"" it means we are trying to stop an argument in global.  As for the joining part if you go on lords and type /join Redacted you should be in Redacted... I am joking, in order to like ""join [R]"" you pretty much have to be on good terms with us which someone in [R] will think that you would be good to have in. We have something though were you have to be 13 years or older to be allowed.  We have our own server but it is all whitelisted. If ya want to know what our best event was? Probably Oktoberfest, atleast that was my favourite.   P.S If you ever see us calling Rob ""Daddy"" it is because of the things in Temple of Jarool.   Oh damn I forgot one other thing, I am pretty sure [R] birthday is coming up sooooo hype :D"

We're just a group of friends that love/care for each other and we play/make various games together,we also really really love making community events. We were founded about a year ago (it'll be a year on the 1st) and have been around ever since. Inside RP we're a silly cliché group of ""villains"" headed by a rabbit for now.  And to answer your joining question, "" Redacted isn't something you join,its something you become and becoming one of us isn't easy"" we do not readily trust."

After... not much thought at all, we decided to be devious and wap behind his back. A dangerous thing to do, given Lord Roamin could easily set our petals ablaze. However...   After a few minutes, Lord Roamin placed another sign which read 'designated wapping area.' Curious, the Grovians went to investigate. We found that Lord Roamin graciously made us a pen to wap in!

Change your name to something that you like... you have the ability to create any character you want! Don't base it off some guy who thinks he's a bear! Base it on your interests... if you like assassins then be an assassin and change your name to a character name... something you're happy with. Again, don't model your character off another's :P"
LordsOfMinecraft,33xcif,teddybeartyler,9,Sun Apr 26 15:38:18 2015 UTC,"1) Stay as ChipQM but do what Cole does and just not get into things that the other QM's do   You obviously misunderstood what Cole meant there. He doesn't want people to stop interacting with the QM's, and he doesn't want people who became friends thanks to a silly thing like this to stop being friends with each other. He just said that he, as the original Cole, will stop interacting with the QM's, he doesn't want to give your group any credit, as by giving it credit people would think he's your leader and he would continue getting messages from random people asking him to join your group. Doing the same thing as Cole makes no sense in your situation.  The important part isn't that you're a group. The controvertial thing is all those people following this movement where they define themselve from another player, that this player doesn't want to be involved in it anymore, and that it's been going on for so long. In this case, the problem is in the name, that's why so few people voted for #1.  Just moving away from the group is not the right anwser. If you are friend with the other QM's it would be a shame to just stop talking to them because of that. You (and the other QM's) should change your name instead. You don't have to do it, even Cole said so, but it would be the best thing to do. If you're afraid people don't recognize you afterward you could keep the Chip part. But at least remove the QM from your name, I mean, these are Cole's IRL initials, it's kinda weird that other people use them in their username (unless those are your initials too, which is unlikely).  Also Han is right, why setting up a poll at the first place if it's to ignore it?"

They don't choose what NPCs do, they don't choose what items they find, etc.  If a player told the DM that ""this NPC does x,"" the DM would look straight at the player and say ""no.  Actually, they do y.""  Similarly, people need to understand how much rp they are in control of."

LordsOfMinecraft,33s220,ChipQM,20,Sat Apr 25 01:58:58 2015 UTC,"Alright.  So, this whole thing started a month after the name changes thing, looking back on my Twitter post about it, it was February 23. I had an alt, and I renamed that alt ""CoolQM"" for a joke. I go to spawn, and stand with my alt. Some friends of mine who were participating in the joke at the time changed into my skin, and we just stood there. People were saying it was the ""Bear Apocalypse"" or something, and out of nowhere, ColdQM shows up. We had no idea who this was, and we found it so hillarious. It really made my day to see that someone went out of their way to do that. Some people started to imitate us but with clown skins, so we left. Next day, ColdQM and CalmQM, a new one, are at spawn. I am shocked, and overjoyed because it's super hilarious. Days pass, more and more show up, and I get loads of messages asking how to become a QM. At the time it was just people renaming their alts for the joke. Then some people start to rename their mains to QM accounts, and that means they're on a normal amount rather than just coming on for a bit for the joke. More people see this, and that's when it all pretty much started to go downhill. I get more and more messages from people asking if they can become a QM, and I routinely tell them that I just really, really don't care. They all band together and buy a plot right outside of the Dwarven portal, and build a cave there for all of them. It was really cute. But then, they started to have meetings, advertise about becoming a QM, and someone even tried to start a BM clan thing. At this point, it had evolved way past anything that was under my control, or a joke with alts and anonymous friends. So I did what I thought was necessary, and just straight up stopped talking to the guys. The two original ones, ColdQM and CalmQM saw this too, and both renamed themselves. For a little while, it worked. They stopped showing 2 every day and maybe just 1 every other day. But then, for reasons I still don't know, they started to spike again. The other day there were at least 4 made that day. They made a server, and a subreddit, and they made posts like this. To this day I still get at least 4 messages daily asking how and if someone can become a QM.  Here are my final thoughts on it.  This has evolved way past anything that remotely resembles how it started, and what I loved so much. I thought and hoped that this would stop months ago, but it has been over two months and it's still going strong, for whatever reason. At this point, I can say I'm just done. Although some of these guys I know, and are friends with, it's become something I never wanted it to: random people joining it because it's ""the cool thing to do"" or ""a clan"" or to just like, get more friends on the server due to their name of something. From now on I'm not going to say anything about or to the QM guys. If they want to stop? Alright, cool. If they don't? Hey, I can't stop you guys, so do whatever you want. Thank you to the guys who did this in the beginning for the fun and happiness you created, and thank you for reading this huge wall of text I wrote <3"

LordsOfMinecraft,33o7zg,Jalbot,1 point,Fri Apr 24 12:53:28 2015 UTC,"i will agree it is a bit to small, mostly because of some of the plots being for the MPD but the only way to make it bigger is to make it wider in width which means they would have to remake the entire building, get rid of plots and, it probably wouldnt be worth doing so anyway :/ Even then it wouldnt feel as special to run a mall plot. Business' would fail as well"

LordsOfMinecraft,33m8j1,Ginauz,1 point,Fri Apr 24 10:13:33 2015 UTC,Short answer nope. Long answer: It is basically an unlimited thing to how many people can be employed so if 400 people are on the server at one time you can pretty much make all of them employed and everyone will be ignoring that person for the rest of lords time. Because massive spam is annoying :P
LordsOfMinecraft,33m8j1,kookachild,4,Thu Apr 23 17:56:28 2015 UTC,It wouldn't be a massive spam though. For each player it would mean getting one notification message for being employed on the plot. The only one who'd be spammed would be the employer and his co-renters. At least that's how the hire system works doesn't it?
LordsOfMinecraft,33m8j1,istisp,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:17:50 2015 UTC,"True, but in terms of how many people got it it would kinda be like spam, also they would have to fire you so even more spammy... It is a bit like when that guy kept messaging everyone on lords at the same time."

I highly disagree with this statement, there are so many people from lords who are just unable to pay rent for there plot because they are at uni, college, work or school and just can not spend time on here as much as they can. Ill take bipen as an example, bipen was away for a while and was unable to really have any time to go onto lords and so he lost his plot, nothing to do with it being boring? Right?

LordsOfMinecraft,33jr6t,charliemadman,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:49:28 2015 UTC,"By the sounds of it, it's bordering on the edge between common and rare.  Certain qualities about it may drive the price down (eg assuming that it might have your name in it, it might knock the price down by a few coins). Also, by the sounds of it, it's not too hard to get from the man himself, which basically will mean, for most people, that they won't pay 1,000,000 GDs for something they can get for free.  That being said, some people are willing to pay good price for 'early' collectables. The best advice to give, as with any pricing, is think of how much you would pay for it, 6 GBs let's say, then decide how much you want to bump the price up by, let's say 50%, which would mean 9GBs. Then try to sell it. If people aren't buying it, you lower the price. If multiple people are interested, then that means you can price it higher, so start an auction or something. If one or two people are interested, then you've probably hit the spot on pricing.  Hopefully this helps in some way! :D"

LordsOfMinecraft,33isbw,hailthechief1,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:49:41 2015 UTC,"I got a wooden sword named ""Toy Sword"" in pink for auction atm on the trading reddit. Current (and probably final bid) is 9.5gd. Unless you want to pay that much for it dont bother. Also most of the time people aren't being ""dicks"" but instead that is the actual price for the item.   Stuff like this is expensive and while people saying they will sell their gold sword for 100 diamonds might not be serious, a good sword or other weapon is expensive and can run into the double digits of diamonds if it is particularly rare.   Most people who have these weapons dont sell them, so it is even harder to obtain one, and people will to greater lengths to get one. Hope I helped and unless you are willing to spend 5gd or more don't hope to get anything close to a wooden sword."

Frankly, it's no ones business to know that anyways, other than plot owners."
LordsOfMinecraft,33fdt6,Abatida,3,Wed Apr 22 05:13:21 2015 UTC,Horrible idea.... people will just wait for someone's rent to go out if they want that plot and bam... they get it.
LordsOfMinecraft,33fdt6,DragonHeart1,2,Wed Apr 22 13:59:47 2015 UTC,There IS a /plotinfo command. It shows the rent of a plot if the plot is unowned :P
LordsOfMinecraft,33fdt6,Honeystormz,-2,Wed Apr 22 02:12:21 2015 UTC,yes but what if i wanna know what peoples are and how much they are paid till so i can see if an inactive player's plot is almost up
LordsOfMinecraft,33fdt6,Rurikar,23,Wed Apr 22 02:18:39 2015 UTC,We don't want players doing that.
LordsOfMinecraft,33fdt6,handsomeGenesis,9,Wed Apr 22 05:25:44 2015 UTC,"Don't you think that is a bit snoopy and would lead to people waiting for nice plots to open up? That would be negative, not positive."
LordsOfMinecraft,33fdt6,kookachild,5,Wed Apr 22 05:07:05 2015 UTC,So what you are saying is that you want to know when a guild plot is running out so everyone can crowd around it and snatch it as soon as they can... Pretty sly if you ask me.

LordsOfMinecraft,3364ld,Wind_Fisher,7,Sun Apr 19 22:22:41 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think this is a great idea. It will allow certain events to get a lot more attention, and I fail to see any downsides to that."
LordsOfMinecraft,3364ld,firehotlavaball,3,Sun Apr 19 23:39:24 2015 UTC,Glad you like the idea and thanks for the positive response.
LordsOfMinecraft,3364ld,WholesaleVirus,2,Sun Apr 19 23:46:57 2015 UTC,"I think it's a good idea. I don't think you should have to merge with anyone, considering that you are paying the rent for the plot.    Also, considering last I checked there is rumored to be a ""Mall Council"" being formulated, having a bulletin board would be great. The Mall is a nice center piece of the server and gets ton of traffic, so people 'may' even want to drop of things there to be posted about too.    All and all, think it's a good idea. You should do it."
LordsOfMinecraft,3364ld,Jalbot,0,Mon Apr 20 18:36:33 2015 UTC,"the only thing is the plot itself, taking up a 1st floor mall plot for a bulletin board is well....... kinda wasteful in my opinion :/"
LordsOfMinecraft,3364ld,teddybeartyler,11,Mon Apr 20 00:22:22 2015 UTC,"hey, they're paying the money for the plot, a lot of it, and the mall has been pretty dead lately so I don't see it as wasteful."
LordsOfMinecraft,3364ld,Jalbot,0,Mon Apr 20 00:46:50 2015 UTC,"what are you talking about? the mall isn't dead, mall plots are packed full, and I do agree that he is paying for it so fine but that doesnt mean it is right for other people (and im not saying this cause i dont have one i do have a plot at the mall)"
LordsOfMinecraft,3364ld,ShifuSheep,4,Mon Apr 20 02:30:27 2015 UTC,"It's not as though mall plots have to be used for stores. A variety is nice. And there's a buny sanctuary right next to it, no one is complaining about that. What he uses the plot for isn't very concerning, it is contributing to the Mall, too."
LordsOfMinecraft,3364ld,8laCkt0N,2,Mon Apr 20 02:37:18 2015 UTC,Really enjoying the discussion and glad 2 out of 3 here enjoy the idea of adding a bit of variety to the mall
LordsOfMinecraft,3364ld,Jalbot,3,Mon Apr 20 03:23:00 2015 UTC,"It also gives a reason to go to the mall, so I approve of this."
LordsOfMinecraft,3364ld,teddybeartyler,0,Mon Apr 20 08:30:01 2015 UTC,perhaps try to see if anyone would mind merging with it? If there is no one then ok go ahead
LordsOfMinecraft,3364ld,Jalbot,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:50:35 2015 UTC,"Dead as-in the hype died the second week it opened... I know I only go to the mall to use the portal, everything died very quickly."

You can also trade nothing and it'll work. You don't need to put an item into the trade box (in case you just want to give someone something). You can only trade droppable items. (So no weapons, blocks, etc.)"
LordsOfMinecraft,3332ot,Peity,2,Sun Apr 19 13:52:19 2015 UTC,Scammmers wont be able to scam anymore but kinda ruins the fun
LordsOfMinecraft,3332ot,McENEN,2,Sun Apr 19 07:21:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as well as I loved the hire system, I don't like this one either. I agreed with most of the reasons why Rob didn't want a trading tool. It's out of roleplay and takes away the trust that you need when you want to trade, which one of the core points of this community. The only thing I like about it is that at least other people can't run in the items you are dropping to steal it form you, which was really annoying. Back in the days I suggested a similar tool, that would just give the item you're holding to the person when you shift right-click on them, without the fancy GUI, but keeping the need to trust.  But hey, there's the other side of the story too. At least people who are less known in the community have better chance trading, as before people were only willing to trade with the 'big' names like Negnar. And I guess it was really annoying for Rob and Nis to solve tickets about scammers and deal with drama posts about scam on the subreddit.  And hey, you can disable it, so who am I to complain?"
LordsOfMinecraft,3332ot,istisp,1 point,Sun Apr 19 09:59:36 2015 UTC,another thing that rob said Dont trust random people and he wont add a safe trading system  but I guess he got tired of dealing about complainers. I personally in the last 6 months have been scamed 2 times

((As for dust in the lungs, I wouldn't be surprised, if that's all they breathe, that either they have a method of filtering the impurities, or that they have just turned off the pain receptors.

LordsOfMinecraft,333pl4,Duffman295,0,Sun Apr 19 06:19:23 2015 UTC,no we block coordinate like cobble is oak wood. then we get a lord and the grove isnt a forest is houses made from wood and leaves besides its flooded. but i think it would look good and would be a nice addition and if you dont want to participate then dont we dont need someone weighing us down with negativity
LordsOfMinecraft,333pl4,Duffman295,3,Sun Apr 19 06:29:30 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I came off as negative to you, I was just trying to inform you that any tree's in the Dwarven District will just be made out of cobble and stone.
